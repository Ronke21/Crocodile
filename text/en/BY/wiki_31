<text>Stephen Elliot Dunn (June 24, 1939June 24, 2021) was an American poet and educator who authored twenty-one collections of poetry. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for his 2000 collection, &quot;Different Hours,&quot; and received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He also won three National Endowment for the Arts Creative Writing Fellowships, Guggenheim Fellowship, and Rockefeller Foundations Fellowship.

==Early life==
Dunn was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York on June 24, 1939. His parents were Ellen (Fleishman) and Charles Dunn. He attended Forest Hills High School, where he played basketball. After graduating in 1957, he studied history at Hofstra University. He played guard for its basketball team and was part of the squad that had a 23–1 record during the 1959–60 season. He was nicknamed &quot;Radar&quot; for his ability to make jump shots.

Dunn graduated from Hofstra University in 1962 and went on to play one season for the Williamsport Billies of the Eastern Basketball Association. He then worked in advertising until he was 26, when he traveled to Spain to pen a novel, which he ended up discarding. He subsequently undertook postgraduate studies at Syracuse University, obtaining a master&#x27;s degree in creative writing in 1970.

==Career==
Dunn began teaching at Stockton University in 1974 and published his first full-length collection entitled &quot;Looking for Holes in the Ceiling&quot; that same year. He continued working at Stockton for approximately three decades, and also taught at Wichita State University, University of Washington, Columbia University, University of Michigan, and Princeton University.

A collection of essays about Dunn&#x27;s poetry was published in 2013. He finished his last book, &quot;The Not Yet Fallen World&quot;, shortly before his death. Published in May 2022, nearly a year after his passing, it was viewed by Dunn as the best work he had written.

==Personal life==
Dunn married his first wife, Lois Kelly, in 1964. Together, they had two children: Susanne and Andrea. They divorced in 2001. He married Barbara Hurd the following year.

Dunn had earlier lived in Port Republic, New Jersey. He later resided at homes in Ocean City, New Jersey, as well as Hurd&#x27;s hometown of Frostburg, Maryland. He died on the night of his 82nd birthday at his home in Frostburg. He suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease prior to his death.

<text>Thorvald Nicolai Thiele (24 December 1838 – 26 September 1910) was a Danish astronomer and director of the Copenhagen Observatory. He was also an actuary and mathematician, most notable for his work in statistics, interpolation and the three-body problem.

Thiele made notable contributions to the statistical study of random time series and introduced the cumulants and likelihood functions, and was considered to be one of the greatest statisticians of all time by Ronald Fisher. In the early 1900s he also developed and proposed a generalisation of approval voting to multiple winner elections called sequential proportional approval voting, which was briefly used for party lists in Sweden when proportional representation was introduced in 1909.

Thiele also was a founder and Mathematical Director of the Hafnia Insurance Company and led the founding of the Danish Society of Actuaries. It was through his insurance work that he came into contact with fellow mathematician Jørgen Pedersen Gram.

Thiele was the father of astronomer Holger Thiele.

The main-belt asteroids 843 Nicolaia (discovered by his son Holger) and 1586 Thiele are named in his honour.

<text>The (stylized as K&#x27;SEI since 2001) is a major private railway in Chiba Prefecture and Tokyo, Japan. The name &quot;Keisei&quot; is the combination of the kanji 京 from and 成 from , which the railway&#x27;s main line connects. The combination uses different readings than the ones used in the city names. The railway&#x27;s main line runs from Tokyo to Narita and the eastern suburb cities of Funabashi, Narashino, Yachiyo, and Sakura. Keisei runs an airport limited express train called the &quot;Skyliner&quot; from Ueno and to Narita International Airport.

In addition to its railway business, the Keisei Electric Railway Company owns large bus and taxi services and some real estate holdings. It owns a controlling share of the Oriental Land Company which owns and manages the Tokyo Disney Resort. Keisei is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 index.

==History==
Keisei was founded on June 30, 1909 and began services on November 3, 1912, initially operating local train service in eastern Tokyo. Its main line reached Narita in 1930 and Ueno in 1933.

Originally a narrow gauge ( Scotch gauge) operator, Keisei converted to in 1959. In 1960, Keisei began through service with the Toei Asakusa Line, the first interline through service arrangement in Japan.

&quot;Skyliner&quot; service began in 1973 and started serving the airport in 1978, when the first Narita Airport Station opened (today&#x27;s Higashi-Narita station). 
A new underground station was opened in 1991 to provide a more direct connection to terminal 1, and in 1992 service began to terminal 2.
On July 17, 2010, &quot;Skyliner&quot; switched its route to the newly built Narita Sky Access and reduced the travel time by 15 minutes.

=== Future plans ===
On 31 October 2023, Keisei announced plans to acquire its subsidiary Shin-Keisei Electric Railway. The acquisition is expected to be completed by April 2025. Plans for the renaming of the existing Shin Keisei Line are expected to be revealed at a later date.

==Lines==
Keisei operates of railway that consists of one trunk line named the Main Line and six branch lines.

The first section of the line, 2.5 km from to , was opened on 27 December 1947, with a track gauge of and electrified at 1,500 V DC overhead. The line was regauged to in October 1953, and the entire line was completed as a single-track line by 21 April 1955. In August 1959, the line was again regauged, this time to to match the standard gauge used by Keisei Electric Railway.

<text>The Oakland Zoo is located in the Grass Valley neighborhood of Oakland, California, United States. Established on June 6, 1922, it is managed by the Conservation Society of California, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of wildlife both locally and globally. The zoo is home to more than 850 native and exotic animals and is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

== History ==

Naturalist Henry A. Snow established the Oakland Zoo on June 6, 1922 - originally at 19th and Harrison streets in downtown Oakland. Snow Park now occupies the site of the zoo&#x27;s first home.

Over the years the zoo relocated several times: first to Sequoia Park, then Joaquin Miller Park and finally in 1939 to Durant Park. Under Joseph R. Knowland, chairman of the California State Parks Commission, California, purchased the land and in 1950 renamed the park to Joseph Knowland State Arboretum and Park.[1]

In 1936, Henry A. Snow&#x27;s son, Sidney Snow, established the nonprofit organization East Bay Zoological Society, which was originally known as the Alameda County Botanical and Zoological Society. The East Bay Zoological Society operated and managed the zoo for the City of Oakland from 1982 until August 2017, when it was renamed the Conservation Society of California to better reflect the zoo&#x27;s evolving purpose and mission in its commitment to conservation. Governed by a volunteer board of trustees, the Conservation Society of California manages and operates Oakland Zoo.

With over 25 wildlife conservation partners globally, the zoo provides funds to support their programs and efforts to save wildlife. Through their partnerships with California Department of Fish and Wildlife, they accept, rehabilitate, and re-home wildlife rescued from wildfire and human-wildlife conflict. This has included 22 mountain lions, 38 California condors, 8 bears, including grizzly bears and American black bears, and over 600 yellow-legged frogs.

==Expansion==

New exhibits have been created, including those for the hamadryas baboons and the chimpanzees. A spacious elephant exhibit was built in 1987. The sun bear exhibit was finished in 1995 and was featured on Animal Planet &quot;Ultimate Zoos&quot;. The white-handed gibbons live on a lush island in the heart of the Tropical Rainforest on Gibbon Island. The African Savannah, with camels, lions, elephants, meerkats, hyenas and more, was completed in 1998.

The Education Center opened its doors in 1999 and the main entrance followed soon in summer 2001. In autumn of 2001, a squirrel monkey exhibit opened along with a larger, renovated tiger exhibit. In the spring of 2007, the four dromedary camels were moved to a larger, fenced enclosure uphill from their old enclosure. 

Oakland zoo provides free and discounted science education programs for underserved students attending Title 1 schools in the Greater Bay Area. It gives 5,500 vouchers every year to schools and community organizations as part of its Zoo-to Community program. It reaches an average of over 3,000 students and 1,000 adults yearly.

In 2012, a fully funded LEED-certified veterinary hospital opened, followed by the opening in 2013 of the Oakland Zoo Biodiversity Center, and the 2014 inauguration of the Condor Recovery Center at Oakland Zoo. Each of these projects has improved care of the zoo&#x27;s animals as well as conservation of the species in the wild.

===California Trail===

The California Trail section opened in summer 2018 at the top of the hill above the main zoo, representing $70 million out of an $81 million multi-phase zoo development. Through live native animal and plant habitats, the zoo highlights the delicate balance between humans and nature, and the impact of change on all three.

Guests travel to the trail via an aerial gondola from the existing zoo. Along the trail, they encounter animals such as bears, wolves, mountain lions, bison and birds of prey. The half-acre California Wilds! playground introduces young children and their families to California wildlife and habitats through themed play structures. Inside the Conservation Habitarium - with a wall-length window into the grizzly bear habitat, visitors explore California&#x27;s diverse habitats, step into the shoes of conservation researchers, and find their place as a member of a community of people taking action for California&#x27;s wildlife. The project was designed by Noll &amp; Tam Architects and built by C. Overaa &amp; Co.

===The Wayne and Gladys Valley Children&#x27;s Zoo===
In the summer of 2005 the Valley Children&#x27;s Zoo opened with spacious new animal exhibits along with plenty of interactive play-structures for children. The lemurs, tortoises, and the interactive Goat and Sheep Contact Yard along with the river otters, American alligators, bats, pigs, rabbits, the Bug Room, and the Reptile and Amphibian Discovery Room are all found in the Children&#x27;s Zoo. One feature popular with younger children are the brass insects embedded in the concrete walkways, which were installed as a form of public art. The Clorox Wildlife Theater, which is home to many animal shows presenting all kinds of creatures, native and non-native, is also found in the Children&#x27;s Zoo.

==Osh the Elephant==
On July 9, 2024, Oakland Zoo announced that Osh (male, 30), the last elephant at the zoo, would be moving later that fall to The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. This is the same place their last elephant, Donna, is now living. This decision was made after months of consideration from zoo staff. Elephants are highly social animals and so it was recommended to move him to another facility that could provide for his social needs. They have not announced yet what they are planning to do with the former elephant paddock or if they will receive more elephants, but they did say that no matter what they decide to do, the enclosure will need to be refurbished and will probably go under construction. Osh left Oakland on October 16th and arrived, after a nearly 50 hours, to Tennessee two days later.

<text>Pulmonaria (lungwort) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae, native to Europe and western Asia, with one species (&quot;P. mollissima&quot;) east to central Asia. According to various estimates there may be between 10 and 18 species found in the wild.

==Description==
Lungworts are evergreen or herbaceous perennials that form clumps or rosettes. They are covered in hairs of varied length and stiffness, and sometimes also bear glands. The underground parts consist of a slowly creeping rhizome with adventitious roots. Flowering stems are unbranched, rough, covered with bristly hairs, usually not exceeding , with a few exceptions (&quot;P. mollis&quot;, &quot;P. vallarsae&quot;). The stems are usually upright, or slightly spreading. The plants reach in height, spreading up to wide.

The leaves are arranged in rosettes. The blades are usually large, from narrowly lanceolate to oval, with the base ranging from heart shaped to very gradually narrowing, and can have a sharply pointed or blunt tip. The leaf margin is always entire, but in some species and forms can be rather wavy. Basal leaves are carried on stalks that can be short or longer than the leaf blade in various species. Stem leaves are smaller and often narrower, and are unstalked or clasping the stem. All leaves are covered with hairs that are usually bristly, or occasionally soft. The leaves are often prominently spotted in black and blue, or sometimes in pale green, or unspotted. The spots are due to the presence of foliage air pockets. These pockets, which cool the lower leaf surface, mask the presence of chlorophyll.

The inflorescence is a terminal scorpioid cyme as a cymose corymb, with bracts, on short pedicels (stalks), reaching just above the foliage. The flowers are heterostylous, with two distinct forms of flower within each species; those with short stamens and long styles (&quot;pin&quot; flowers) and those with long stamens and short styles (&quot;thrum&quot; flowers), with the former usually being larger and more showy. The calyx is hairy, 5-lobed, tubular or funnel-shaped, enlarging as the fruit ripens. The corolla is funnel-shaped and consists of a long, cylindrical tube and a limb with five shallow lobes. Within the corolla throat, five tufts of hairs alternate with the stamens to form a ring. The colour of the corolla varies from purple, violet or blue to shades of pink and red, or sometimes white. The colour of the flower in bud is often pink to violet when they first emerge, which then changes to blue as the flower matures. The stamens and style are included within the corolla and not protruding.

The nutlets are smooth, egg-shaped, brownish, up to long and wide, each containing a single seed. Up to four nutlets per flower are produced, ripening mostly in summer.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pulmonaria&quot; is a genus in the Boraginoideae subfamily of &quot;Boraginaceae&quot;, consisting of approximately 18 species, although species delineation (speciation) has proved problematic. Within the Boraginoideae, &quot;Pulmonaria&quot; is placed in the tribe Boragineae, where it is closely related to &quot;Borago&quot;.

===Species===
18 species are accepted.

*&quot;Pulmonaria affinis&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria angustifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria australis&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria carnica&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria cesatiana&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria collina&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × digenea&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × heinrichii&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria helvetica&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria hirta&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × hybrida&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × intermedia&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria kerneri&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × landoziana&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria longifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria mollis&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria montana&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × norica&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × notha&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria obscura&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria officinalis&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria × ovalis&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria rubra&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria saccharata&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria stiriaca&quot; 
*&quot;Pulmonaria visianii&quot; 
=== Etymology===

The scientific name &quot;Pulmonaria&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;pulmo&quot; (lung). In the times of sympathetic magic, the spotted oval leaves of &quot;P. officinalis&quot; were thought to symbolize diseased, ulcerated lungs, and so were used to treat pulmonary infections. The common name in many languages also refers to lungs, as in English &quot;lungwort&quot;, German &quot;Lungenkraut&quot;, French &quot;herbe aux poumons&quot;, Serbian &quot;plućnjak&quot;... In some East European languages, the common name is derived from a word for honey, e.g. Russian &quot;medunitza&quot;, Polish &quot;miodunka&quot;, Serbian &quot;meduniče&quot;, Bulgarian &quot;медуница&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The species of the genus are distributed across Eurasia.

== Ecology ==

&quot;Pulmonaria&quot; is an early spring flowering deciduous perennial, retaining its leaves till late winter, just before the new growth emerges.

=== Pests and diseases ===

&quot;Pulmonaria&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species. These include the case-bearer &quot;Coleophora pulmonariella&quot;, which feeds exclusively on &quot;P. saccharata&quot;, and the moth &quot;Ethmia pusiella&quot;, which has been recorded on &quot;P. officinalis&quot;.

==Cultivation==

Of the known species of &quot;Pulmonaria&quot;, only about eight are known in cultivation. Pulmonaria are used as ornamental garden plants, particularly &quot;P. saccharata&quot;, &quot;P. angustifolia&quot; and &quot;P. longifolia&quot;. Others include &quot;P. affinis&quot;.They are especially valued as groundcover in damp shaded areas, producing their blue and/or pink flowers in late winter and early spring, accompanied by dense clusters of heart-shaped leaves that are often strikingly mottled and marbled, throughout summer.

The following cultivars, of mixed or uncertain parentage, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-

<doc id="701287" wikidata="Q3281980" url="?curid=701287" title="Measure of a Man (Clay Aiken album)">
<text>Measure of a Man is the debut album by American singer Clay Aiken. It was released on October 14, 2003 through RCA Records, five months after the conclusion of the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

&quot;Measure of a Man&quot; was supported by three singles: &quot;Invisible&quot;, &quot;&quot;The Way&quot;/&quot;Solitaire&quot;, and &quot;I Will Carry You&quot;. The album received generally mixed reviews from critics. The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 613,000 copies in its first week. The album also held the number one spot for two consecutive weeks. It was certified 
double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in November 2003.

==Promotion==

=== Singles ===
&quot;Invisible&quot; is the first single from the album. It was initially released as a promo-only single in September 2003, and only became available as digital downloads much later. It peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary and at number 37 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts on January 6, 2004. The single was certified gold for digital downloads by the RIAA on March 31, 2006.

&quot;The Way&quot;/&quot;Solitaire&quot; was released as the album second single on March 16, 2004. &quot;The Way&quot; peaked at number one on the Canadian Singles Chart.
&quot;I Will Carry You&quot; is the third single and peaked at number 25 on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart.

===Music videos===
The music video for &quot;Invisible&quot;, directed by Diane Martel, was shot in Hollywood at Hollywood &amp; Highland, a major outdoor shopping center and tourist attraction. Aiken invited 800 fans to be part of the crowd scene in the video.

&quot;The Way&quot; music video was also directed by Diane Martel. Instead of the traditional Hollywood types Aiken hired everyday people to play the couples shown in this video.

==Critical reception ==
Wade Paulsen of Reality TV World wrote that despite huge sales &quot;Critics have ranged from strongly positive (Billboard) to mixed (Washington Post, which calls the CD a &quot;likable album even without being a particularly good one&quot;, and Knight-Ridder), to negative (Associated Press, which refers to the song selections as &quot;insipid&quot;), to scathingly negative (the New York Daily News). &quot; 

===Awards and nominations===
==Commercial performance==
&quot;Measure of a Man&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 613,000 copies in its first week. This became Aiken&#x27;s first US number one debut. This was also the highest-selling debut for a solo artist since Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot; in December 1993. In its second week, the album remained at number one on the chart, selling an additional 225,000 copies. In its third week, the album fell to number three on the chart, selling 141,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the album fell to number eight on the chart, selling 113,000 copies, bringing its four-week total to 1.1 million copies. On November 17, 2003, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over two million copies. As of February 2011, the album has sold 2.8 million copies in the United States.

==Track listing==
In the summer of 2004, a second version of the album was released in which &quot;Solitaire&quot; (Neil Sedaka / Phil Cody) replaced &quot;This is the Night&quot; as a bonus cut.

In some of the international releases, the bonus track, &quot;This is the Night&quot; was replaced by &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;. The album released in Japan also included &quot;On the Wings of Love&quot; as a second bonus track.

<text>In medicine, a cathartic is a substance that &quot;accelerates&quot; defecation. This is similar to a laxative, which is a substance that &quot;eases&quot; defecation, usually by softening feces. It is possible for a substance to be both a laxative and a cathartic. However, agents such as psyllium seed husks increase the bulk of the feces.

Cathartics such as sorbitol, magnesium citrate, magnesium sulfate, or sodium sulfate were previously used as a form of gastrointestinal decontamination following poisoning via ingestion. They are no longer routinely recommended for poisonings. High-dose cathartics may be an effective means of ridding the lower gastrointestinal tract of toxins; however, they carry a risk of electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Catharsis can be an effect of pesticide poisonings, such as with elemental sulfur.

<text>The A1W reactor is a prototype nuclear reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The A1W designation stands for:
* A = Aircraft carrier platform
* 1 = First generation core designed by the contractor
* W = Westinghouse was the contracted designer

== History ==
The reactor was a Westinghouse Electric Corporation-built naval reactor power plant, installed in the Naval Reactors Facility in the desert at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Arco, Idaho. It first operated in October 1958. This reactor plant consisted of two reactors, A1W-A and A1W-B, operated in tandem so that the steam produced by both reactors was used to power one turbine connected to a drive shaft. 

Since the purpose of A1W prototype was to simulate the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; at sea it was also possible to divert the steam to two &#x27;dump condensers&#x27; that simulated launching aircraft. Also, the electricity generated by the Main Engine was dissipated by immersing three electrodes in a pool of water. This was done to simulate load. In the early 1970s the A1W-B core was replaced with 1/4 of the USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; core for testing. 

This nuclear reactor was the prototype for the A2W reactor used in the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (CVN-65).

The A1W prototype was used to train nuclear-qualified sailors for almost 34 years until its reactor plants were shut down on January 26, 1994.

<doc id="701295" wikidata="Q7388211" url="?curid=701295" title="S1W reactor">
<text>The S1W reactor was the first prototype naval reactor used by the United States Navy to prove that the technology could be used for electricity generation and propulsion on submarines. 

The designation of &quot;S1W&quot; stands for
* S = Submarine platform
* 1 = First generation core designed by the contractor
* W = Westinghouse was the contracted designer
and is a later Navy designation. During the plant&#x27;s early years the project name was &quot;Submarine Thermal Reactor&quot; (STR)

The land-based nuclear reactor was built at the National Reactor Testing Station, later called Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Arco, Idaho.
The plant was the prototype for the power system of USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SSN-571), the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, which used the improved S2W reactor. The specific location within the vast Idaho National Laboratory where the S1W prototype was located was the Naval Reactors Facility.

== Design ==
Under the leadership of Captain (later Admiral) Hyman G. Rickover, Naval Reactors followed a concurrent design strategy, with the design and construction of the S1W reactor taking place ahead of the design and construction of the &quot;Nautilus&quot;. This enabled problems to be identified and resolved before they appeared in the shipboard plant. To better support this design process, the S1W power plant was built inside of a submarine hull. While the cramped spaces prevented engineers from obtaining information on some plant components, it provided a much more realistic example of how the shipboard plant would have to be constructed.

== Operation ==

The S1W was a pressurized water reactor that utilized water as the coolant and neutron moderator in its primary system, and enriched Uranium-235 in its fuel elements. The S1W reactor reached criticality on March 30, 1953. In May of that year, it began power operations, performing a 100-hour run that simulated a submerged voyage from the east coast of the United States to Ireland. This test run clearly demonstrated the revolutionary impact that nuclear propulsion would have upon the submarine, which prior to that time was greatly limited in its ability to conduct continuous underwater operations by battery life and by the oxygen requirement of diesel propulsion systems.

The heated, pressurized water of the S1W reactor power plant was circulated through heat exchangers in order to generate high pressure saturated steam in a separate water loop. This saturated steam powered steam turbines for propulsion and generation of electricity. These facilities were constructed inside an elevated hull simulating the engineering portion of the &quot;Nautilus&quot; hull. A single propeller was simulated through use of a water brake. Large, exterior water spray ponds were used to dissipate the heat energy created in the facility into the air.

Following the commissioning of the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;, the S1W plant was operated to support plant testing and training of operators. Trainees were graduates of the Naval Nuclear Power School in Bainbridge, MD, Mare Island, CA or Orlando, FL (all locations now closed). The course of study lasted six months and consisted of a combination of classroom and closely supervised practical training.

In the mid-1960s, the S1W core was removed. An extension was bolted to the top of the reactor vessel so that a larger S5W reactor core could be installed. After that time the prototype was called S1W/S5W core 4. The new core was first taken critical in late summer of 1967. In order to use the additional power generated by the S5W reactor, additional facilities were added in order to dump the excess steam when the plant was operated at higher power levels. These steam dumps were constructed in the same building, but outside the mock submarine hull.

The S1W/S5W plant was shut down permanently in 1989 (October 17).

<doc id="701298" wikidata="Q2384463" url="?curid=701298" title="Flying Without Wings">
<text>&quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; is a song by Irish boy band Westlife, released on 18 October 1999 as the third single from their self-titled debut studio album (1999). It is the band&#x27;s fourth-best-selling single on both paid-for and combined sales in the United Kingdom as of January 2019.

==Background==
The song was written by Wayne Hector and Steve Mac. In an interview with HitQuarters, Hector said the basic idea for the song came to him while on a break from working on a hip hop session with Ezi Cut in Los Angeles: I came up with a couple of lines for the first verse and then phoned my mama&#x27;s house, left it on the answering machine, and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t get rid of this!&quot; Upon returning to England, Hector went into the studio to work on the idea with long-time songwriting partner and producer Steve Mac. When the two discussed what the song was about they agreed that &quot;this is about our wives. This is about the things that make our lives complete.&quot; According to Hector the lyrics were completed in about half an hour. He added, &quot;Flying Without Wings was a life-changing moment, and a song he says he is particularly proud of. A big moment for me was when Flying Without Wings came out, I&#x27;d had a few Number 1s at that point, but that convinced people I could write good pop songs. After that, I started working with bigger acts and over a more diverse range of genres, including country and rock, which helped me pick up some credibility.&quot; The band&#x27;s manager later revealed the song had been planned as the first solo single for Boyzone&#x27;s Stephen Gately. &quot;Stephen did the demo and he thought it was going to be his song,&quot; Walsh recalls. &quot;I&#x27;ll be quite honest, I missed it, but as soon as Simon heard it he just went bananas. It was really difficult because Westlife were on tour with Boyzone, as the support act.&quot;

In a documentary aired on UTV called &quot;Westlife Back Home&quot;, band member Shane Filan said it is probably the best song of their career, while former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern (band member Nicky Byrne&#x27;s father-in-law) revealed it is his favourite tune from the chart-topping band. The song also won the band their first of four &quot;Record of the Year&quot; prizes on the annual televised ITV music awards on 11 December 1999, scoring a total of 159,590 votes to beat Boyzone&#x27;s Ronan Keating to the title.

The Official Charts Company stated, &quot;Flying Without Wings wasn&#x27;t the first boyband ballad, nor is it the biggest selling, but it was certainly influential. After Flying Without Wings, what self-respecting boyband would dare stay seated on a stool for a key change? Stand, boys! Flying Without Wings has soundtracked births, proposals, marriages, funerals, and untold TV talent show montages over the last two decades.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The song became the group&#x27;s third UK number-one single, spending 13 weeks on charts. It also received a platinum sales certification in the UK and has sold over 800,000 copies with 37 million streams there as of November 2021.

<doc id="701299" wikidata="Q7564475" url="?curid=701299" title="Soulful (Dionne Warwick album)">
<text>Soulful is the twelfth album by Dionne Warwick. Released in 1969 on Scepter Records, it was the first of Warwick&#x27;s Scepter albums that did not directly involve her longtime production and songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Instead, the album was produced by Warwick and Chips Moman and was composed of covers of soul hits and soul-influenced pop songs.

==History==
Warwick was encouraged to make an R&amp;B album by the surprise appearance of the B-side of her smash hit &quot;Do You Know the Way to San Jose&quot;: &quot;Let Me Be Lonely&quot; on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The gospel-tinged track reached #71 with little to no promotion .

&quot;Soulful&quot; was recorded at Moman&#x27;s American Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, and Warwick was backed by the studio houseband comprising Gene Chrisman (drums), Tommy Cogbill (bass), Bobby Emmons (keyboards) and Reggie Young (guitar). Thirteen tracks were recorded: Warwick&#x27;s renditions of &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever&quot; and &quot;The Love of My Man&quot; were not included on the album.

The track &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feeling&quot; was the only single released from the album in the U.S. and a success at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart(#13 R&amp;B). In the UK, Dionne had a minor hit with &quot;People Got to Be Free&quot; written by Rascals Felix Cavaliere &amp; Eddie Brigati. With a #11 peak on the Billboard Hot 200 album chart, &quot;Soulful&quot; was one of Warwick&#x27;s more successful albums in the 1960s, due in part to its promotion via full-page newspaper ads placed by Warwick.

In 1972, Scepter released &quot;From Within&quot;, which included all 13 tracks from the &quot;Soulful&quot; sessions as well as 13 obscure R&amp;B influenced tracks by Warwick. Issued as Warwick was ending her tenure with Scepter, &quot;From Within&quot; reached #169; the tracks &quot;The Love of My Man&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Your Puppet&quot; were issued as singles respectively bubbling under the Hot 100 at #107 and #113.

In January 2004, Rhino Handmade issued the limited edition (5000 copies) &quot;Soulful Plus&quot; an internet-only purchase disc comprising the 13 tracks from the &quot;Soulful&quot; sessions plus nine obscure R&amp;B influenced tracks by Warwick and a previously unreleased version of &quot;Put a Little Love in Your Heart&quot;.

<doc id="701301" wikidata="Q749941" url="?curid=701301" title="Subway 400">
<text>The Subway 400 was the second race of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series season until 2004, held a week after the Daytona 500. This 400-mile (644 km) annual race was sponsored by Subway and was held at North Carolina Speedway (&quot;The Rock&quot;) since 1966. From 1966 to 1995, the race distance was 500 miles (805-km) which was shortened to 400 miles starting from the 1996 season.

Until the 2004 Nextel Cup season, two annual races were held at Rockingham. After the 2003 season, the fall race (the Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400) — which was held in November — was moved to California Speedway, to be held on the lucrative Labor Day weekend. This displaced the Mountain Dew Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway, which moved to November 2004 before being removed from the schedule completely (replaced by a second date at Texas Motor Speedway). The changes were part of the trend of less races being held in the southeast and a broader distribution across the United States. Though the spring date was not directly transferred to California, NASCAR moved up the first California race to the traditional spring Rockingham date the week after Daytona. This resulted in some criticism because teams had to travel cross-country for the second race as most spend two weeks in Daytona and are based in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. The draw for Rockingham was that teams got to stay close to home right after Daytona before traveling for the next race.

The 2004 Subway 400 had one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history. Nextel Cup rookie, Kasey Kahne, in just his second series start, lost the race to Matt Kenseth by inches at the line. The exciting finish proved to be NASCAR&#x27;s last stand at Rockingham, as the race (and the track, for that matter), were removed from the schedule permanently after that due to the Ferko lawsuit. While the NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series returned to the track in 2025 (Trucks had previously returned in 2012 and 2013), the Cup Series did not.

<text>Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory is a U.S. Government-owned research and development facility in the Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, that works exclusively on the design and development of nuclear power for the U.S. Navy. It was one of the leaders in creating the nuclear navy.

The laboratory is part of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, a joint U.S Navy-Department of Energy program responsible for the research, design, construction, operation and maintenance of U.S. nuclear-powered warships.

The laboratory was founded in 1949 on the site of the former Bettis Field, named after Cyrus Bettis. It covers approximately . From the Lab&#x27;s founding until 1998, it was run by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Bechtel Corporation won the contract to run the laboratory on September 19, 2008 and assumed operation on February 1, 2009, first under its subsidiary Bechtel Bettis, Inc., later under Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation. The contract changed hands again when Fluor Corporation, as their subsidiary Fluor Marine Propulsion, LLC won the contract to run the laboratory on July 12, 2018 and assumed operations on October 1, 2018. 

The laboratory developed Oak Ridge National Laboratory&#x27;s original design of the pressurized water reactor (PWR) for operational naval use. It built the nuclear propulsion plants for the first U.S. nuclear submarines and surface ships including , , , and .

Westinghouse&#x27;s Nuclear Power Division adapted the PWR design for commercial use and built the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States, the Shippingport Power Plant in the west hills of Pittsburgh.

The laboratory had two supercomputers listed on the 26th TOP500 List (November 2005). Ranked 97 a 1,090 processor Opteron system and ranked 405 a 536 processor Itanium 2 system.

The laboratory is also home to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Bettis Reactor Engineering School. The school provides a post-graduate certificate program in nuclear engineering with a focus on nuclear reactor design, construction, and operations. It is open only to naval personnel and Bettis engineers.

The laboratory had been chosen to develop the Project Prometheus nuclear power source for the JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter) project, however, funding for this program was cancelled in the fall of 2005.

<doc id="701320" wikidata="Q2334407" url="?curid=701320" title="Languages of Canada">
<text>A multitude of languages have always been spoken in Canada. Prior to Confederation, the territories that would become Canada were home to over 70 distinct languages across 12 or so language families. Today, a majority of those indigenous languages are still spoken; however, most are endangered and only about 0.6% of the Canadian population report an indigenous language as their mother tongue. Since the establishment of the Canadian state, English and French have been the co-official languages and are, by far, the most-spoken languages in the country.

According to the 2016 census, English and French are the mother tongues of 56.0% and 21.4% of Canadians respectively. In total, 86.2% of Canadians have a working knowledge of English, while 29.8% have a working knowledge of French. Under the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; of 1969, both English and French have official status throughout Canada in respect of federal government services and most courts. All federal legislation is enacted bilingually. Provincially, only in New Brunswick are both English and French official to the same extent. French is Quebec&#x27;s official language, although legislation is enacted in both French and English and court proceedings may be conducted in either language. English is the official language of Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, but government services are available in French in many regions of each, particularly in regions and cities where Francophones form the majority. Legislation is enacted in both languages and courts conduct cases in both. In 2022, Nova Scotia recognized Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk as the first language of the province, and maintains two provincial language secretariats: the Office of Acadian Affairs and Francophonie (French language) and the Office of Gaelic Affairs (Canadian Gaelic). The remaining provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) do not have an official provincial language but government is primarily English-speaking. Territorially, both the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have official indigenous languages alongside French and English: Inuktut (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) in Nunavut and, in the NWT, nine others (Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé/Zhatıé, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́, and Tłįchǫ Yatıì).

Canada&#x27;s official languages commissioner (the federal government official charged with monitoring the two languages) said in 2009, &quot;[I]n the same way that race is at the core of what it means to be American and at the core of an American experience and class is at the core of British experience, I think that language is at the core of Canadian experience.&quot; To assist in more accurately monitoring the two official languages, Canada&#x27;s census collects a number of demolinguistic descriptors not enumerated in the censuses of most other countries, including home language, mother tongue, first official language, and language of work.

Canada&#x27;s linguistic diversity extends beyond English, French and numerous indigenous languages. &quot;In Canada, 4.7 million people (14.2% of the population) reported speaking a language other than English or French most often at home and 1.9 million people (5.8%) reported speaking such a language on a regular basis as a second language (in addition to their main home language, English or French). In all, 20.0% of Canada&#x27;s population reported speaking a language other than English or French at home. For roughly 6.4 million people, the other language was an immigrant language, spoken most often or on a regular basis at home, alone or together with English or French whereas for more than 213,000 people, the other language was an indigenous language. Finally, the number of people reporting sign languages as the languages spoken at home was nearly 25,000 people (15,000 most often and 9,800 on a regular basis).&quot;

==The two official languages==

===Home language: rates of language use 1971–2011===
The percentage of the population speaking English, French or both languages most often at home has declined since 1986; the decline has been greatest for French. The proportion of the population who speak neither English nor French in the home has increased. Geographically, this trend remains constant, as usage of English and French have declined in both English and French speaking regions of the country, but French has declined more rapidly both inside and outside Quebec. The table below shows the percentage of the total Canadian population who speak Canada&#x27;s official languages most often at home from 1971 to 2006. Note that there are nuances between &quot;language most spoken at home&quot;, &quot;mother-language&quot; and &quot;first official language&quot;: data is collected for all three, which together provide a more detailed and complete picture of language-use in Canada.

===Use of English===

In 2011, just under 21.5 million Canadians, representing 65% of the population, spoke English most of the time at home, while 58% declared it their mother language. English is the major language everywhere in Canada except Quebec and Nunavut, and most Canadians (85%) can speak English. While English is not the preferred language in Quebec, 36.1% of Québécois can speak English. Nationally, Francophones are five times more likely to speak English than Anglophones are to speak French – 44% and 9% respectively. Only 3.2% of Canada&#x27;s English-speaking population resides in Quebec—mostly in Montreal.

In 2011, 28.4 million Canadians had knowledge of English while only 21.6 million Canadians spoke it most often at home.

===Use of French===
In 2011, just over 7.1 million Canadians spoke French most often at home, this was a rise of 4.2%, although the proportion of people in Canada who spoke French &quot;most often&quot; at home fell slightly from 21.7% to 21.5% . Of these, about 6.1 million or 85% resided in Quebec. Outside Quebec, the largest French-speaking populations are found in New Brunswick (which is home to 3.1% of Canada&#x27;s Francophones) and Ontario (4.2%, residing primarily in the eastern and northeastern parts of the province and in Toronto and Ottawa). Overall, 22% of people in Canada declare French to be their mother language, while one in three Canadians speak French and 70% are unilingual Anglophones. Smaller indigenous French-speaking communities exist in some other provinces. For example, a vestigial community exists on Newfoundland&#x27;s Port au Port Peninsula, a remnant of the &quot;French Shore&quot; along the island&#x27;s west coast.

The percentage of the population who speak French both by mother tongue and home language has decreased over the past three decades. Whereas the number of those who speak English at home is higher than the number of people whose mother tongue is English, the opposite is true for Francophones. There are fewer people who speak French at home, than learned French after birth.

Ethnic diversity is growing in French Canada but still lags behind the English-speaking parts of the country. In 2006, 91.5% of Quebecers considered themselves to be of either &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Canadian&quot; origin. As a result of the growth in immigration, since the 1970s, from countries in which French is a widely used language, 3.4% of Quebecers indicated that they were of Haitian, Belgian, Swiss, Lebanese or Moroccan origin. Other groups of non-francophone immigrants (Irish Catholics, Italian, Portuguese, etc.) have also assimilated into French over the generations. The Irish, who started arriving in large numbers in Quebec in the 1830s, were the first such group, which explains why it has been possible for Quebec to have had five premiers of Irish ethnic origin: John Jones Ross (1884–87), Edmund James Flynn (1896–97), Daniel Johnson Sr. (1966–68), Pierre-Marc Johnson (1985), and Daniel Johnson Jr. (1994).

In 1991, due to linguistic assimilation of Francophones outside Quebec, over one million Canadians who claimed English as their mother tongue were of French ethnic origin (1991 Census).

===Bilingualism and multilingualism versus English–French bilingualism===

According to the 2011 census, 98.2% of Canadian residents have knowledge of one or both of the country&#x27;s two official languages, Between 2006 and 2011, the number of persons who reported being able to conduct a conversation in both of Canada&#x27;s official languages increased by nearly 350,000 to 5.8 million. The bilingualism rate of the Canadian population edged up from 17.4% in 2006 to 17.5% in 2011. This growth of English-French bilingualism in Canada was mainly due to the increased number of Quebecers who reported being able to conduct a conversation in English and French.

Bilingualism with regard to nonofficial languages also increased, most individuals speaking English plus an immigrant language such as Punjabi or Mandarin.

====Geographic distribution of English–French bilingualism====

According to the 2011 census, 94.3% of Quebecers have knowledge of French, and 47.2% have knowledge of English. Bilingualism (of the two official languages) is largely limited to Quebec itself, and to a strip of territory sometimes referred to as the &quot;bilingual belt&quot;, that stretches east from Quebec into northern New Brunswick and west into parts of Ottawa and northeastern Ontario. 85% of bilingual Canadians live within Quebec, Ontario and New Brunswick. A majority of all bilingual Canadians, (57.4%) are themselves Quebecers, and a high percentage of the bilingual population in the rest of Canada resides in close proximity to the Quebec border.

Similarly, the rate of bilingualism in Quebec has risen higher, and more quickly than in the rest of Canada. In Quebec, the rate of bilingualism has increased from 26% of the population being able to speak English and French in 1951 to 42.5% in 2011. As of 2011, in the rest of Canada (excluding Quebec) the rate of bilingualism was 7.5%.

==== English–French bilingualism rates ====
English–French bilingualism is highest among members of local linguistic minorities. It is very uncommon for Canadians to be capable of speaking only the minority official language of their region (French outside Quebec or English in Quebec). Only 1.5% of Canadians are able to speak only the minority official language, and of these most (90%) live in the bilingual belt.

As the table below shows, rates of bilingualism are much higher among individuals who belong to the linguistic minority group for their region of Canada, than among members of the local linguistic majority. For example, within Quebec around 37% of bilingual Canadians are Francophones, whereas Francophones only represent 4.5% of the population outside Quebec.

=== Official language minority communities ===
French-speaking Canadians from outside Quebec and English-speaking Quebecers are, together, the official language minority communities. These communities are:

====French outside Quebec====
The language continuity index represents the relationship between the number of people who speak French most often at home and the number for whom French is their mother tongue. A continuity index of less than one indicates that French has more losses than gains – that more people with French as a mother tongue speak another language at home. Outside Quebec, New Brunswick has the highest French language continuity ratio. British Columbia and Saskatchewan have the lowest French language continuity ratio and thus the lowest retention of French. From 1971 to 2011, the overall ratio for French language continuity outside Quebec declined from 0.73 to 0.45. Declines were the greatest for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland.

==Non-official languages spoken in Canada==

=== Indigenous languages ===


Canada is home to a rich variety of indigenous languages, most of which are spoken nowhere else. There are 14 indigenous language groups in Canada with about 100 distinct languages and dialects, including many sign languages. Almost all indigenous languages in Canada are considered endangered, with the exception of Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, and the Cree varieties Naskapi, Atikamekw, East Cree, and Plains Cree. Prior to colonization, multilingualism was common across indigenous nations, many of whom often seasonally migrated. However, the reserve system created more permanent stationary bands, which have generally selected only one of their various ancestral languages to try to preserve in the face of increasing Anglicization, Francization, or Amslanization (the process by which American Sign Language replaces local sign languages). In addition, the residential school system attempted to institutionally exterminate languages and cultures from coast to coast to coast. The cruel methods (such as physical and sexual abuse, as well as death rates as high as one in twenty children) resulted in a sharp declines in language use across all nations, including amongst deaf and signing communities.

Robert Falcon Ouellette, a Cree Member of Parliament, played a pivotal role in promoting indigenous languages within the Canadian Parliament and Canadian House of Commons. He was instrumental in obtaining unanimous consent from all political parties to change the standing orders to allow indigenous languages to be spoken in the House of Commons, with full translation services provided. This historic change enabled Ouellette to deliver a speech in Cree, marking the first use of an indigenous language in the House on Jan 28, 2019. 

Furthermore, Bill C-91, the Indigenous Languages Act passed in 2019, was enacted to support and revitalize indigenous languages across Canada. This legislation, aims to reclaim, revitalize, and maintain indigenous languages through sustainable funding and the establishment of the Office of the Commissioner of Indigenous Languages. Ouellette was the chair of the indigenous caucus in the House of Commons and helped ensure it passage before the election of 2019. 

Two of Canada&#x27;s territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun, known collectively as Inuktut, are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government. In the Northwest Territories, the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; declares that there are eleven different languages: Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé, English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́, and Tłįchǫ. Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.

Awaiting royal assent in October 2022 on Treaty Day, Nova Scotia has affirmed Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk as the &quot;First Language&quot; of the province through a bill titled the &quot;Mi&#x27;kmaw Language Act&quot; (No. 148). The Act establishes a language committee co-developed and co-run by Miꞌkmaw Kinaꞌmatnewey as well as ensuring &quot;government support for the preservation, revitalization, promotion and protection of the Mi’kmaw language for generations to come,&quot; collaboratively developing strategy between the Mi&#x27;kmaq of Nova Scotia and the Government of Nova Scotia.

According to the 2016 census, less than one per cent of Canadians (213,225) reported an indigenous language as their mother tongue, and less than one per cent of Canadians (137,515) reported an indigenous language as the language spoken most often at home. Whilst most Canadian indigenous languages are endangered and their current speaker numbers are frequently low, the number of speakers has grown and even outpaced the number with an indigenous mother tongue, indicating that many people continue to learn the languages even if not initially raised with them.

Given the destruction of indigenous state structures, academics usually classify indigenous peoples of Canada by region into &quot;culture areas&quot;, or by their language family.
* Arctic cultural area (Inuit languages, including Inuit Sign Language)
* Subarctic culture area (Na-Dene and Algonquian languages)
* Eastern Woodlands (Northeast) cultural area (Algonquian and Iroquoian languages)
* Plains cultural area (Algonquian, Plains Sign, and Siouan languages)
* Northwest Plateau cultural area (Ktunaxa, Na-Dene, and Salishan languages, including Secwepemcékst and &quot;Plateau Sign Language&quot;)
* Northwest Coast cultural area (Haida, Salishan, Tsimshianic, and Wakashan languages, possibly including Coast Salish Sign Language)

Source: Statistics Canada, &quot;2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship&quot; Ottawa, 2007, pp. 2, 6, 10.There exist numerous Cree languages, such as Plains Cree ( ), Woods Cree ( ), Swampy Cree (E: , W: ), Moose Cree ( ), and East Cree (N: S: ).Although small in number, these languages have been included without data to show the disparity in information between oral and sign languages. The Canadian Association of the Deaf state that, in their opinion, &quot;no fully credible census of Deaf, deafened, and hard of hearing people has ever been conducted in Canada.&quot; By extension, there exists no credible data on sign languages, especially of indigenous sign languages.

&quot;Glottolog&quot; 4.3 (2020) counted 13 independent indigenous language families and/or isolates in Canada. A potential fourteenth family, that of the sign languages of the Plateau, possibly hosting languages like Secwepemcékst and Ktunaxa Sign Language, remains unlisted by Glottolog. It remains unknown to academia the extent which sign languages are spoken and how they relate to and across linguistic families.

===Pidgins, mixed languages, &amp; trade languages===
In Canada, as elsewhere in the world of European colonization, the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade and (in some cases) intermarriage led to the development of hybrid languages. These languages tended to be highly localized, were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language, and often persisted only briefly, before being wiped out by the arrival of a large population of permanent settlers, speaking either English or French.

====Belle Isle Pidgin====
Spoken until about 1760, this pidgin was spoken between Breton and Basque fishermen and NunatuKavummiut of NunatuKavut (Labrador).

====Bungee====
Named from the Ojibwe word &quot;bangii&quot; meaning &quot;a little bit,&quot; the meagrely documented Bungi Creole (also known as Bungee, Bungy, Bungie, Bungay, and as the Red River Dialect) is a mixed language predominantly anchored in English that evolved within the Prairie Métis community, specifically the Countryborn or Anglo-Métis. Due to the multicultural nature of the Red River Settlement, Bungi was influenced by Scottish English, Nehiyawewin, Nakawemowin, the Orcadian dialect of Scots, Norn, Scottish Gaelic, and Canadian French. The vocabulary and word order were primarily English, but the speech was lilting like that of Gaelic speakers, with pronunciation and structural shifts coming from the Cree languages, such as: &quot;shawl&quot; becoming &quot;sawl&quot;, &quot;she&quot; becoming &quot;see&quot;, and the popular greeting &quot;I’m well, you but?&quot;. Bungi reached its peak in the nineteenth century, with about 5,000 Countryborn native speakers of the dialect in 1870. However, over the next century, standard Canadian English gradually replaced it; and by the late 1980s, only a handful of elderly speakers remained. It is generally considered to be asleep today.

====Chiac====
Spoken in the Maritime provinces (mostly in New Brunswick), Chiac is a creole language with a linguistic base in Acadian French and Maritime English with significant contributions from Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk and the Maliseet language. Notable for its code-switching between English and French, it is often popularly considered a variant of Franglais, with examples such as: &quot;Espère-moi su&#x27;l&#x27;corner, j&#x27;traverse le ch&#x27;min pi j&#x27;viens right back&quot; (Wait for me at the corner, I&#x27;m crossing the road and I&#x27;ll be right back) and &quot;On va amarrer ça d&#x27;même pour faire sûr que ça tchenne&quot; (We will tie it like this to make sure it stays). However, Chiac is not simply a &quot;Franglais&quot;/&quot;Frenglish&quot; mix of French and English, as it differs distinctly from other French-English mixed-use cases such as those found amongst Fransaskois or Ontarois.

====Chinook Jargon====
In British Columbia, Yukon and throughout the Pacific Northwest, a pidgin language known as the Chinook Jargon (also rendered &quot;Chinook Wawa&quot;) emerged in the early 19th century that was a combination of Chinookan, Nootka, Chehalis, French and English, with a smattering of words from other languages including Hawaiian and Spanish. Later in that century, it had creolized in the Pacific Northwest. Certain words and expressions remain current in local use, such as skookum, tyee, and saltchuck, while a few have become part of worldwide English (&quot;high mucketymuck&quot; or &quot;high muckamuck&quot; for a high-ranking and perhaps self-important official).

====Franglais====
A portmanteau language which is said to combine English and French syntax, grammar and lexicons to form a unique interlanguage, is sometimes ascribed to mandatory basic French education in the Canadian anglophone school systems. Many unilingual anglophone Canadians, for instance, will borrow French words into their sentences. Simple words and phrases like &quot; (what is that?) or words like &quot; (stop) can alternate with their English counterparts. This phenomenon is more common in the eastern half of the country where there is a greater density of Francophone populations. Franglais can also refer to the supposed degradation of the French language thanks to the overwhelming impact Canadian English has on the country&#x27;s Francophone inhabitants, though many linguists would argue that while English vocabulary can be freely borrowed as a stylistic device, the grammar of French has been resistant to influences from English and the same conservatism holds true in Canadian English grammar, even in Quebec City.

====Haida Jargon====
A pidgin trade language based on Haida, known as Haida Jargon, was used in the 1830s in and around Haida Gwaii. It was used by speakers of English, Haida, Coast Tsimshian, Heiltsuk, and other languages.

====Loucheux Jargon====
As a result of cultural contact between the Gwich&#x27;in (formerly called &quot;Loucheaux&quot;) and Europeans (predominately French coureurs des bois and voyageurs), a pidgin language was historically used across Gwich&#x27;in Nành, Denendeh. The language is often called in English &quot;Jargon Loucheux&quot; using the traditional French syntax.

====Michif====
Michif (also known as Mitchif, Mechif, Michif-Cree, Métif, Métchif, and French Cree) is a mixed language which evolved within the Prairie Métis community that was oriented towards Cree and Franco-Catholic culture. It is based on elements of Cree and French along with elements of Ojibwa and Assiniboine. Michif is today spoken by fewer than 1,000 individuals in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and North Dakota. At its peak, around 1900, Michif was understood by perhaps three times this number.

====Nootka Jargon====
Based in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and likely one precursor to Chinook Wawa, Nootka Jargon was a trade language derived from Nuučaan̓uł, English, Spanish, and Russian, as well as other local languages.

====Slavey Jargon====
Also known as &quot;Broken Slavey,&quot; this language was spoken until the mid-1900s, abruptly diminishing due to the influx of English into Denendeh and Inuit Nunangat. Documentation has also shown that the language was spoken by a range of fur traders, postmasters, and their wives, sisters, and daughters, who were often of Métis descent. The native languages of speakers who used Slavey Jargon were Denesuline, French, Gwich&#x27;in, Inuktitut, and the languages collectively known as &quot;Slavey&quot; (North: Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́, K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́, and Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́; South: Dene Yatıé or Dene Zhatıé and Dené Dháh). The Dene, Inuit, French, British, and Métis who spoke the language did so predominately for preaching the gospel, teasing and harassing clergymen, and for interpersonal relationships. The use of Slavey Jargon can be characterized as an innovation employed by speakers in order to meet several linguistic goals, such as introductions, advice, and disputes. Mishler specified, &quot;For all these reasons, Slavey Jargon seems inaccurate to characterize it strictly as a trade jargon&quot; (p. 277).

Spoken predominately in the Liard and Dehcho Countries of Denendeh, the nouns of the language generally consisted of English, Dënësųłınë́ Yatıé, Sahtúgot’įné / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́, and Dene Yatıé/Zhatıé, whereas the verbs and pronouns are derived from French. Adverbs are typically pulled from Dënësųłınë́ and Gwich’in. There is, however, a lot of variation in Slavey Jargon. Gwich’in verbs can be mixed with French nouns or phonemically modified French sentences exist.

==== Souriquois ====
Spoken alongside the Basque/Breton–Inuit Belle Isle pidgin was another pidgin language that developed in the 16th century amongst the Basque in coastal areas along the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Strait of Belle Isle as the result of contact between Basque whalers and local Algonquian peoples, notably the Mi&#x27;kmaq. The name &quot;Souriquois&quot; has an obscure history and most likely refers to region around Souris and the Basque suffix &quot;koa&quot;, perhaps from &quot;zurikoa&quot; “that of the whites.&quot;

=== Sign languages ===
Alongside the numerous and varied oral languages, Canada also boasts several sign languages. Currently, Canada is home to some five or more sign languages (that number rising with the probability that Plains Sign Talk is actually a language family with several languages under its umbrella), belonging to four to six distinct language families, those being: French Sign Language family, BANZSL family, the Plains Sign family, the Inuit Sign isolate, perhaps the Coast Salish Sign isolate, and perhaps a Plateau Sign family composed of Secwepemcékst and Ktunaxa Sign Language.

As with all sign languages around the world that developed naturally, these are natural, human languages distinct from any oral language. As such, American Sign Language (unlike Signed English) is no more a derivation of English than Russian is, all being distinct languages from one another. Some languages present here were trade pidgins which were used first as a system of communication across national and linguistic boundaries of First Nations, however, they have since developed into mature languages as children learned them as a first language.

The sign languages of Canada share extremely limited rights within the country in large due to the general population&#x27;s misinformation on the subject. Ontario is the only province or territory to formally make legal any sign language, enabling the use of American Sign Language, Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) and &quot;First Nation Sign Language&quot; (which could refer to Plains Sign Talk, Oneida Sign Language, or any other language) in only the domains of education, legislation and judiciary proceedings. The only other language afforded any other rights is Inuiuuk, which sees interpretation in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. There have been efforts to make LSQ an official language of Quebec, but all efforts have failed.

==== American Sign Language ====
The most utilized sign language in Canada, American Sign Language or ASL, can be found across the country in mostly anglophone regions. The ties with anglophone Canada are not due to ASL and English&#x27;s similarity, but to cultural similarities and linguistic history (as several ASL words are borrowed from English). As such, ASL can be found in areas where English is not the primary language, such as Montreal or Nunavut. ASL is part of the French Sign Language (Francosign) family, originating on the East Coast of the United States from a mix of &quot;Langue des signes françaises&quot; (LSF) and other local languages.

==== Coast Salish Sign Language ====
There is evidence that Coast Salish citizens speak a distinct sign language.

==== Hand Talk ====
Originally a trade pidgin, Plains Sign Talk, also known as Plains Standard or Prairie Sign Language, became a full language after children began to learn the language as a first language across many Nations. From &quot;HANDS&quot; and &quot;TO TALK TO,&quot; Hand Talk was used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; across linguistic and national boundaries across the continent and the language stretched across the provinces down through Mexico. As Plains Sign Talk was so widespread and was a spectrum of dialects and accents, it probably hosted several languages under its umbrella. One is potentially Navajo Sign Language which is in use by a sole Navajo clan.

=====Oneida Sign Language=====
Born out of the Oneida Nation, OSL is a mixed language, descended primarily from both Prairie Sign Language (or Hand Talk) and the oral Oneida language, with some additions from ASL. Onʌyota&#x27;a:ká (or Oneida) Sign Language is a young and growing language, spreading especially amongst deaf Oneida citizens.

==== Inuit Sign Language ====
Inuit Sign Language, also known as Atgangmuurngniq or Uukturausingit, is a critically endangered language with some 50 speakers remaining. It is a language isolate and has only be found by researchers in Nunavut; however, there are theories it extends across the Arctic Circle. Little is known about its history, but efforts are being made to document and revitalize the language.

==== Maritime Sign Language ====
Maritime Sign Language is a BANZSL language. It was used as the language of education for Deaf populations in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island before ASL became available in the mid-20th century. It is still remembered by some elderly people but is moribund. The language, living alongside ASL, has produced a unique dialect of ASL in The Maritimes due to mixing of the languages. The exact number of speakers is unknown.

==== Plateau Sign Language ====
Another trade pidgin that may have become a separate language, Plateau Sign Language replaced Plains Sign Talk in the Columbia Plateau and surrounding regions of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is now extinct.

===== Ktunaxa Sign Language =====
Called &quot;ʾa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam&quot; in the Ktunaxa language, Ktunaxa Sign Language has historically been spoken in Ktunaxa ɁamakaɁis (Ktunaxa Country).

===== Secwépemc Sign Language =====
Perhaps related to or descended from the old Plateau Sign Language, Secwepemcékst or Secwépemc Sign Language is spoken by a small number of Secwépemc citizens.

==== Quebec Sign Language ====
Alongside ASL, Quebec Sign Language or LSQ (&quot;Langue des signes québécoise&quot;) is the second most spoken sign language in the country. Centred mainly around and within Quebec, LSQ can also be found in Ontario, New Brunswick and various other parts of the country, generally around francophone communities due to historical ties to the French language. Although approximately 10% of the population of Quebec is deaf or hard-of-hearing, it is estimated that only 50,000 to 60,000 children use LSQ as their native language. LSQ is part of the Francosign family with ASL. As such, both languages are mutually intelligible.

===Canadian dialects of European languages===

==== Acadian French ====
Acadian French is a unique form of Canadian French which incorporates not only distinctly Canadian phrases but also nautical terms, English loanwords, linguistic features found only in older forms of French as well as ones found in the Maritimer English dialect.

===== Brayon French =====
A sub-dialect of Acadian French, Brayon French is spoken by those in Madawaska County of New Brunswick. The language is a mix of Acadian and Quebec French with influence from the local Mi&#x27;kmaw and Maliseet languages, with only slight differentiation from the more standard Acadian French.

==== Québec French ====
As the most spoken variety of French in Canada, Québec French contains a significant number of dialects, generally grouped in two: the &quot;old&quot; dialects of the territories at the time of the British conquest and the &quot;new&quot; dialects that arose post-conquest.

===== Chaouin French =====
Around 1615 as the coureurs des bois moved past the city of Quebec, those who settled in &quot;Ndakinna&quot; (Abenaki land) developed unique features still found today, especially in the Bois-Francs region South of the St. Lawrence.

===== Joual French =====
Originally the dialect of the French-speaking working class in Montréal, the cultural renaissance connected to the Quiet Revolution have resulted in Joual being spoken by people across the educational and economic spectrum.

===== Màgoua French =====
Possibly deriving from the Atikamekw word for &quot;loon&quot; (&quot;makwa&quot;; standard French: &quot;huard&quot;), the French spoken by the Magoua community is one of the most conservative French dialects in North America. This basilectal dialect is found in Nitaskinan as the Trois-Rivières region became the first stronghold of the coureurs des bois outside the city of Quebec in 1615. Magoua French preserves the sontaient (&quot;étaient&quot;) characteristic of Métis French and Cajun French, has a creole-like past tense particle tà, and has old present-tense contraction of a former verb &quot;to be&quot; that behave in the same manner as subject clitics.

==== Métis French ====
Alongside Michif and Bungi, the Métis dialect of French is one of the traditional languages of the Métis people, and the French-dialect source of the Michif language. Métis French is a variety of Canadian French with some added characters Ññ, Áá, Óó, and Ææ (from older French spellings), such as: English: &quot;there is no birthmark on this boy.&quot; There are also significant amounts of words loaned from indigenous languages such as Ojibwemowin, Dane-zaa Ẕáágéʔ (Beaver), and several Cree languages. Like Michif, Métis French is spoken predominantly in Manitoba as well as adjacent provinces and US states. As a general rule, Métis individuals tend to speak one or the other, rarely both.

==== Newfoundland French ====
Tracing their origins to Continental French fishermen who settled in the late 1800s and early 1900s, rather than the Québécois, Newfoundland French (or &quot;français terre-neuvien&quot;) refers to the French spoken on the Port au Port Peninsula (part of the so-called “French Shore”) of Newfoundland. Some Acadians of the Maritimes also settled in the area. For this reason, Newfoundland French is most closely related to the Breton and Norman French of nearby St-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Today, heavy contact with Acadian French—and especially widespread bilingualism with Newfoundland English—have taken their toll, and the community is in decline. The degree to which lexical features of Newfoundland French constitute a distinct dialect is not presently known. It is uncertain how many speakers survive; the dialect could be moribund. There is a provincial advocacy organisation &quot;Fédération des Francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador&quot;, representing both the Peninsular French and Acadian French communities.

==== Ontarois French ====
Although quite similar to Quebec French, the dialect of the Ontarois or Franco-Ontarians maintains distinctive features. These include the progressive disappearance of the subjunctive, the use of the possessive &quot;á&quot;, the transfer of rules from English to French, e.g., &quot;J’ai vu un film sur/à la télévision&quot; which comes from &quot;I saw a film on television&quot;, or &quot;Je vais à la maison/chez moi&quot; coming from &quot;I&#x27;m going home,&quot; and the loaning of English conjunctions such as &quot;so&quot; for &quot;ça fait que&quot; or &quot;alors&quot;.

==== Black English ====
In what is also called Black Canadian, Afro-Canadian, or African Canadian English, there exist several varieties of English spoken by Black Canadians. The most well-established is the dialect spoken by Afro-Nova Scotians. In places like Toronto where there is a large population of Afro-Caribbean descendants and newcomers, localized varieties of Black English take on elements of Caribbean English, as well as mixing with African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). Although AAVE is not nearly as widespread in Canada as it is across the United States, Black Canadians have various lines of connection to the dialect. Sometimes that connection is historical, such as with Black Nova Scotians; sometimes it is hegemonic, where Afro-Canadians adopt speech mannerisms from the larger United States; sometimes it is diasporic, where communities of African-American newcomers or African-American descendants coalesce, especially in larger cities.

===== Afro-Nova Scotian English =====
African Nova Scotian English is spoken by descendants of Black Nova Scotians, black immigrants from the United States. Though most African American freedom seekers in Canada ended up in Ontario through the Underground Railroad, only the dialect of African Nova Scotians retains the influence of West African pidgin. In the 19th century, African Nova Scotian English would have been indistinguishable from English spoken in Jamaica or Suriname. However, it has been increasingly de-creolized since this time, due to interaction and influence from the white Nova Scotian population. Desegregation of the province&#x27;s school boards in 1964 further accelerated the process of de-creolization. The language is a relative of the African-American Vernacular English, with significant variations unique to the group&#x27;s history in the area. There are noted differences in the dialects of those from Guysborough County (Black Loyalists), and those from North Preston (Black Refugees), the Guysborough group having been in the province three generations earlier.

Howe and Walker use data from early recordings of African Nova Scotian English, Samaná English, and the recordings of former slaves to demonstrate that speech patterns were inherited from nonstandard colonial English. The dialect was extensively studied in 1992 by Shana Poplack and Sali Tagliamonte from the University of Ottawa.

A commonality between African Nova Scotian English and African-American Vernacular English is (r)-deletion. This rate of deletion is 57% among Black Nova Scotians, and 60% among African Americans in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in the surrounding mostly white communities of Nova Scotia, (r)-deletion does not occur.

==== Cascadian English ====
The English language in British Columbia shares numerous features with the neighbouring states of Washington and Oregon, such as the /æɡ/ raising (found words such as bag, vague and bagel). Boreal Cascadian English speakers exhibit more vowel retraction of /æ/ before nasals than people from Toronto, and younger speakers in the Greater Vancouver area do not raise /aʊ/ as much, but keep the drop in intonation, causing &quot;about&quot; to sound slightly like &quot;a baht.&quot; The &quot;o&quot; in such words as holy, goal, load, know, etc. is pronounced as a close-mid back rounded vowel, [o], but not as rounded as in the Prairies where there are strong Scandinavian, Slavic and German influences, which can lend to a more stereotypical &quot;Canadian&quot; accent.

==== Indigenous English ====
The varieties of English spoken by indigenous people are phonologically influenced by their first or traditional languages. This has resulted in an identifiable dialect spectrum distinct from other Canadian English dialects. Due to the ongoing stigmatization of indigenous cultures, indigenous children could be wrongly diagnosed as having a speech impairment or a learning disability, when what is identified by medical professionals are simply the dialectal features.

Some written works use indigenous English dialects. For example, Maria Campbell&#x27;s book &quot;Stories of the Road Allowance People&quot; is a collection of Métis folktales. An excerpt from that work illustrates the type of speech used by Elders in rural Métis communities during her research, but some stories were collected in Cree or other languages and translated into dialectical English by Campbell:

==== Lunenburg English ====
Spoken in Lunenburg and Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia, this moribund dialect is sometimes called &quot;Lunenburg Dutch&quot; due to its rooting in the large Kurpfalzisch and Württembergisch population who settled the town. Although the German language subsided significantly, the English of the town and county continue to be marked by its influence. Indeed, the pronunciation in Lunenburg county is the only Canadian community to be non-rhotic. The accent features Canadian raising and so flight [ˈflʌɪt] has a different vowel from fly [ˈflɑɪ], and the noun house [ˈhoʊs] has a different vowel from the verb house [ˈhɑʊz]. In Lunenburg, the phrase &quot;about a boat&quot; contains two identical stressed and two identical unstressed vowels: /əˌboʊt ə ˈboʊt/, rather than the Standard Canadian English /əˌbaʊt ə ˈboʊt/, with distinct stressed vowels. Due to German influence, there is a tendency to pronounce /w/ in witch the same as /v/ as in van. Another example is the lack of the dental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/, which are replaced by the alveolar stops /t/ and /d/ (rendering &quot;thank&quot; and &quot;tank&quot; homophonous as /ˈtæŋk/), and the &quot;t&quot; at the end of words is usually silent: &quot;get&quot; becomes &quot;ge.&quot;

For example, here is a sample of a conversation between two people: 

==== Maritime English ====
Spoken across the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and PEI, this English dialect has been influenced by British and Irish English, Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and some Acadian French, as well as by Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk.

==== Newfoundland English ====
The initial European settlers to Newfoundland were fishermen from the various coastal villages of the English West Country of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, and Wiltshire beginning in the 1500s (previously they visited in summer and returned). This set the basic speech patterns for those settlers who fanned out into isolated coves and bays along the island&#x27;s of coastline to take advantage of the scattered off-shore fishing areas. Labrador, today the greater part of &quot;Newfoundland&quot;, was then sparsely settled. The West Country dialects continued to be spoken in isolated coves and fjords of the island thus preserving varied dialects of what is today referred to as Newfoundland English.

It was not until the 1700s that social disruptions in Ireland sent thousands of Irish from the southeastern counties of Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, and Cork and to the Avalon peninsula in the eastern part of Newfoundland where significant Irish influence on the Newfoundland dialects may still be heard.

Some of the Irish immigrants to Newfoundland were native speakers of Irish making Newfoundland the only place outside Europe to have its own Irish dialect. Newfoundland was also the only place outside Europe to have its own distinct name in Irish: &quot;Talamh an Éisc&quot;, which means &#x27;land of the fish&#x27;. The Irish language is now extinct in Newfoundland.

After 400 years, much of the dialectal differences between the isolated settlements has levelled out beginning in the 20th century when faster boats (using gas engines instead of oars or sails), and improved road connections provided easier social contact. As well, influences from mainland North America began to affect the local dialects beginning during WWII when US and Canadian servicemen were stationed in Newfoundland and accelerating after Newfoundland became a Canadian province in 1949. Lack of an official orthography, publications in dialect, speaker attrition and official disinterest in promoting the language has been contributing factors towards a decline of speakers of the older, traditional Newfoundland English in the original settlements.

====Ottawa Valley Twang====
Ottawa Valley Twang is the accent, sometimes referred to as a dialect of English, that is spoken in the Ottawa Valley, in Ontario. The Ottawa Valley is considered to be a linguistic enclave within Ontario.

==== Quebec English ====
The language of English-speaking Quebecers generally aligns to Standard Canadian English, however established ethnic groups retain certain, distinctive lexical features, such as the dialects spoken by Mohawk, Cree, , Irish, Jewish, Italian, and Greek communities. Isolated fishing villages on the Basse-Côte-Nord speak Newfoundland English, and many Gaspesian English-speakers use Maritime English.

==== Toronto slang ====
Spoken within the Greater Toronto Area, Toronto slang is the nuanced, multicultural English spoken in the city. This dialect is heavily influenced by the different communities present, most notably the Jamaican, Trinidadian, Guyanese, and other Caribbean communities and their ways of speaking. There is also influence from West African, East African, and South Asian communities.

==== Canadian Gaelic ====
Canadian Gaelic was spoken by many immigrants who settled in Glengarry County (Ontario) and the Maritimes—predominantly in New Brunswick&#x27;s Restigouche River valley, central and southeastern Prince Edward Island, and across the whole of northern Nova Scotia—particularly Cape Breton. While the Canadian Gaelic dialect has mostly disappeared, regional pockets persist. These are mostly centred on families deeply committed to their Celtic traditions. Nova Scotia currently has 500–1,000 fluent speakers, mostly in northwestern Cape Breton. There have been attempts in Nova Scotia to institute Gaelic immersion on the model of French immersion. As well, formal post-secondary studies in Gaelic language and culture are available through St. Francis Xavier University, Saint Mary&#x27;s University, and Cape Breton University

In 1890, a private member&#x27;s bill was tabled in the Canadian Senate, calling for Gaelic to be made Canada&#x27;s third official language. However, the bill was defeated 42–7.

==== Newfoundland Irish ====
Newfoundland is home to the largest population of Irish-descendants in Canada and once hosted a thriving Irish Gaelic linguistic community. Although steep declines around the 20th century meant that the Irish language on the Island hardly remains, there exists today strong interest with consistent efforts to revive the language.

Newfoundland Irish has left an impact on the English spoken on the Island, including terms like &quot;scrob&quot; &quot;scratch&quot; (Irish ), &quot;sleveen&quot; &quot;rascal&quot; (Irish ) and &quot;streel&quot; &quot;slovenly person&quot; (Irish ), along with grammatical features like the &quot;after&quot; perfect as in &quot;she&#x27;s already after leavin (Irish ). As well, both Newfoundland (&quot;Talamh an Éisc&quot;, &quot;Land of the Fish&quot;) and St. John&#x27;s (&quot;Baile Sheáin&quot;) have distinct names in the Irish-language. The dialect of Irish spoken in Newfoundland is said to resemble the Munster Irish of the 18th century.

Events and institutions are increasingly supporting the language with ever larger Céilithe móra, students participating in Conradh na Gaeilge events, people playing Gaelic sports, and Irish film festivals attracting English- and Irish-speakers alike. There is also an Irish language instructor, appointed every year by the Ireland Canada University Foundation, who works at Memorial University in St. John&#x27;s, where the university&#x27;s Digital Learning Centre provides resources for learning the Irish language.

==== Newfoundland Welsh ====
Some Welsh is found in Newfoundland. In part, this is as a result of Welsh settlement since the 17th century. Also, there was an influx of about 1,000 Patagonian Welsh, who migrated to Canada from Argentina after the 1982 Falklands War. Welsh-Argentines are fluent in Spanish as well as English and Welsh.

==== Canadian Ukrainian ====
Canada is also home to Canadian Ukrainian, a distinct dialect of the Ukrainian language, spoken mostly in Western Canada by the descendants of first two waves of Ukrainian settlement in Canada who developed in a degree of isolation from their cousins in what was then Austria-Hungary, the Russian Empire, Poland, and the Soviet Union.

==== Doukhobor Russian ====
Canada&#x27;s Doukhobor community, especially in Grand Forks and Castlegar, British Columbia, has kept its distinct dialect of Russian. It has a lot in common with South Russian dialects, showing some common features with Ukrainian. This dialect&#x27;s versions are becoming extinct in their home regions of Georgia and Russia where the Doukhobors have split into smaller groups.

==== Deitsch ====
A variety of West Central German spoken by the Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonites and other descendants of German immigrants in Canada, Pennsylvania Dutch or Deitsch is closely related to the Palatine dialects of the Upper Rhine Valley. Of the estimated 300,000 speakers, most are found across several US states, whilst there is a sizable community within Ontario.

==== Hutterisch ====
Centred in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, the Hutterite communities maintain a distinct form of the German language descended from Bavarian dialects spoken in Tyrol (by founder Jacob Hutter). The language shifted in the mid-18th century toward a more Carinthian linguistic base upon the deportation of Landler from Austria to Transylvania. There is only about a 50% intelligibility between Pennsylvania Dutch speakers and Hutterisch. Its speaker base belongs to the &quot;Schmiedleit&quot;, &quot;Lehrerleit&quot;, and &quot;Dariusleit&quot; groups with a few speakers among the older generations of &quot;Prairieleit&quot; (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies). Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies first learn and speak Hutterisch before learning English. Of the estimated 34,000 speakers in the world (as of 2003), 85% of them live in 370 communities in Canada. Canadian adults are generally literate in Early New High German (also called &quot;Biblical German&quot;, the predecessor to Standard German used by Martin Luther) that they employ as the written form for Scriptures, however Hutterisch is, for the most part, an unwritten language.

==== Plautdietsch ====
Plautdietsch is predominantly found in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario where Mennonite communities settled. The Mennonites, or Russian Mennonites as they are sometimes called, descend from Low country Anabaptists who fled from what is today the Netherlands and Belgium in the 16th century to escape persecution and resettled in the Vistula delta. Their language is a fusion of Dutch, West Frisian and Dutch Low Saxon dialects which over time mixed with the East Low German dialects of Werdersch, Nehrungisch and Weichselisch.

==Official multilingualism==
===Language policy of the federal government===

English and French have equal status in federal courts, the Parliament of Canada, as well as in all federal institutions.

The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. Immigrants who are applying for Canadian citizenship must normally be able to speak either English or French.

The principles of bilingualism in Canada are protected in sections 16 to 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; of 1982 which establishes that:
* French and English are equal to each other as federal official languages;
* Debate in Parliament may take place in either official language;
* Federal laws shall be printed in both official languages, with equal authority;
* Anyone may deal with any court established by Parliament, in either official language;
* Everyone has the right to receive services from the federal government in his or her choice of official language;
* Members of a minority language group of one of the official languages if learned and still understood (i.e., French speakers in a majority English-speaking province, or vice versa) or received primary school education in that language has the right to have their children receive a public education in their language, where numbers warrant.

Canada&#x27;s &quot;Official Languages Act,&quot; first adopted in 1969 and updated in 1988, gives English and French equal status throughout federal institutions.

===Language policies of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories===
====Officially bilingual or multilingual: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the three territories====
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Canada&#x27;s three territories have all given official status to more than one language. In the case of New Brunswick, this means perfect equality. In the other cases, the recognition sometimes amounts to a formal recognition of official languages, but limited services in official languages other than English.

The official languages are:
* New Brunswick: English and French. New Brunswick has been officially bilingual since the 1960s. The province&#x27;s officially bilingual status has been entrenched in the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; since 1982.
* Nova Scotia: Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk is considered the province&#x27;s official &quot;first language.&quot;
* Northwest Territories: Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé, English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́, and Tłįchǫ.
* Nunavut: English, Inuktut (Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun), and French.
* Yukon: English and French.

====Officially French-only: Quebec====
Until 1969, Quebec was the only officially bilingual province in Canada and most public institutions functioned in both languages. English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts. With the adoption of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; (also known as &quot;Bill 101&quot;) by Quebec&#x27;s National Assembly in August 1977, however, French became Quebec&#x27;s sole official language. However, the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; enumerates a defined set of language rights for the English language and for Aboriginal languages, and government services are available, to certain citizens and in certain regions, in English. As well, a series of court decisions have forced the Quebec government to increase its English-language services beyond those provided for under the original terms of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot;. Regional institutions in the Nunavik region of northern Quebec offer services in Inuktitut and Cree.

====&quot;De facto&quot; English only, or limited French-language services: the other eight provinces====
Most provinces have laws that make either English or both English and French the official language(s) of the legislature and the courts but may also have separate policies in regards to education and the bureaucracy.

For example, in Alberta, English and French are both official languages of debate in the Legislative Assembly, but laws may be drafted solely in English and there is no legal requirement that they be translated into French. French can be used in some lower courts and education is offered in both languages, but the bureaucracy functions almost solely in English. Therefore, although Alberta is not officially an English-only province, English has a higher &quot;de facto&quot; status than French. Ontario and Manitoba are similar but allow for more services in French at the local level.

== Knowledge of languages ==

The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses, and first appeared on the 1991 Canadian census. The following figures are from the 1991 Canadian census, 2001 Canadian census, 2011 Canadian census, and the 2021 Canadian census.

<doc id="701322" wikidata="Q284649" url="?curid=701322" title="Pointe du Hoc">
<text>La Pointe du Hoc () is a promontory with a cliff overlooking the English Channel on the northwestern coast of Normandy in the Calvados &quot;department&quot;, France.

In World War II, Pointe du Hoc was the location of a series of German bunkers and machine gun posts. Prior to the invasion of Normandy, the German army fortified the area with concrete casemates and gun pits. On D-Day, the United States Army Provisional Ranger Group attacked and captured Pointe du Hoc after scaling the cliffs. United States generals including Dwight D. Eisenhower had determined that the place housed artillery that could slow down nearby beach attacks.

==Background==

Pointe du Hoc lies west of the center of Omaha Beach. As part of the Atlantic Wall fortifications, the prominent cliff top location was fortified by the Germans.

The battery was initially built in 1943 to house six captured French First World War vintage GPF 155 mm K418(f) guns positioned in open concrete gun pits. The battery was garrisoned by the 2nd Battery of Army Coastal Artillery Battalion 1260 (&quot;Heeres-Küsten-Artillerie-Abteilung 1260&quot; or &quot;2/HKAA.1260&quot;). To defend the promontory from attack, elements of the 352nd Infantry Division were also stationed at the battery.

==Prelude==

To provide increased defensive capability, the Germans began to improve the defenses of the battery in the spring of 1944, with enclosed H671 concrete casemates being started and the older 155 mm guns displaced. The plan was to build six casemates but two were unfinished when the location was attacked. The casemates were built over and in front of the circular gun pits, which housed the 155 mm guns.

Also built was a H636 observation bunker and L409a mounts for 20 mm Flak 30 anti-aircraft guns. The 155 mm guns would have threatened the Allied landings on Omaha and Utah beaches when finished, risking heavy casualties to the landing forces.

In the months before D-Day the Germans were recorded by Allied Intelligence removing their guns one by one as they re-developed the site with the final aim of four casemates facing Utah Beach and the possibility of two 155 mm guns in open emplacements. During the preparation for Operation Overlord it was determined by Lt Col. James Earl Rudder that Pointe du Hoc should be attacked by ground forces, to prevent the Germans using the casemates.

Recently released documents in the US Archives show that Rudder knew prior to landing that the casemates were unfinished and only two were actually structurally close to being ready. They remain that way today. The U.S. 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions were given the task of assaulting the strong point early on D-Day. Elements of the 2nd Battalion went in to attack Pointe du Hoc but delays meant the remainder of the 2nd Battalion and the complete 5th Battalion landed at Omaha Beach as their secondary landing position.

Though the Germans had removed the main armament from Pointe du Hoc, the beachheads were shelled by field artillery from the nearby Maisy battery, which was fired on by the heavy cruiser HMS &quot;Hawkins&quot;&quot;.&quot; The rediscovery of the battery at Maisy has shown that it was responsible for firing on the Allied beachheads until 9 June 1944.

== Plan ==
Pointe du Hoc lay within General Leonard Gerow&#x27;s V Corps field of operations. This then went to the 1st Infantry Division (the Big Red One) and then down to the right-hand assault formation, the 116th Infantry Regiment attached from 29th Division. In addition they were given two Ranger battalions to undertake the attack.

The Ranger battalions were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Earl Rudder. The plan called for the three companies of Rangers to be landed by sea at the foot of the cliffs, scale them using ropes, ladders, and grapples while under enemy fire, and engage the enemy at the top of the cliff. This was to be carried out before the main landings. The Rangers trained for the cliff assault on the Isle of Wight, under the direction of British Commandos.

Major Cleveland A. Lytle was to command Companies D, E and F of the 2nd Ranger Battalion (known as &quot;Force A&quot;) in the assault at Pointe du Hoc. During a briefing aboard the Landing Ship Infantry TSS &quot;Ben My Chree&quot;, he heard that French Resistance sources reported the guns had been removed. Impelled to some degree by alcohol, Lytle became quite vocal that the assault would be unnecessary and suicidal and was relieved of his command at the last minute by Provisional Ranger Force commander Rudder. Rudder felt that Lytle could not convincingly lead a force with a mission that he did not believe in. Lytle was later transferred to the 90th Infantry Division where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

==Battle==

=== Landings ===

The assault force was carried in ten landing craft, with another two carrying supplies and four DUKW amphibious trucks carrying the ladders requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade. One landing craft carrying troops sank, drowning all but one of its occupants; another was swamped. One supply craft sank and the other put the stores overboard to stay afloat. German fire sank one of the DUKWs. Once within a mile of the shore, German mortars and machine guns fired on the craft.

These initial setbacks resulted in a 40-minute delay in landing at the base of the cliffs, but British landing craft carrying the Rangers finally reached the base of the cliffs at 7:10am with approximately half the force it started out with. The landing craft were fitted with rocket launchers to fire grapnels and ropes up the cliffs. As the Rangers scaled the cliffs, the Allied ships USS &quot;Texas&quot; (BB-35), USS &quot;Satterlee&quot; (DD-626), USS &quot;Ellyson&quot; (DD-454), and HMS &quot;Talybont&quot; (L18) provided them with fire support in an attempt to prevent the German defenders above from firing down on the assaulting troops. The cliffs proved to be higher than the ladders could reach.

===Attack===
The original plans had also called for an additional, larger Ranger force of eight companies (Companies A and B of the 2nd Ranger Battalion and the entire 5th Ranger Battalion) to follow the first attack, if successful. Flares from the cliff tops were to signal this second wave to join the attack, but because of the delayed landing, the signal came too late, and the other Rangers landed on Omaha instead of Pointe du Hoc. The added impetus these 500-plus Rangers provided on the stalled Omaha Beach landing has been conjectured to have averted a disastrous failure there, since they carried the assault beyond the beach, into the overlooking bluffs and outflanked the German defenses.

When the Rangers made it to the top at Pointe du Hoc, they had sustained 15 casualties. &quot;Ranger casualties on the beach totaled about 15, most of them from the raking fire to their left&quot;. The force also found that their radios were ineffective. Upon reaching the fortifications, most of the Rangers learned for the first time that the main objective of the assault, the artillery battery, had been removed. The Rangers regrouped at the top of the cliffs, and a small patrol went off in search of the guns. Two different patrols found five of the six guns nearby (the sixth was being repaired) and destroyed their firing mechanisms with thermite grenades.

The Small Unit Actions Report, written by US Army Intelligence, states that there were times (some hours) when the Rangers did not see a single German after the initial fighting. Amateur Historian Gary Sterne suggests this gave Lt. Col. Rudder the time to have continued moving inland. This plan would have only been possible had the remainder of the 2nd Rangers come in as reinforcements, but that would have also possibly cost Omaha Beach. Despite what Sterne would suggest, after two days of fighting, 77 of the 225 soldiers that had landed at the Pointe had been killed, with another 152 wounded, indicating that there was indeed fierce fighting occurring. Thomas M. Hatfield, a senior research fellow at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin, and director of its Military History Institute, notes that the allegations that &quot;Rudder knew of a secret intelligence report claiming the enemy guns on Pointe du Hoc had been removed, negating the necessity of an assault to destroy them,&quot; are, &quot;entirely false.&quot; Hatfield continued, &quot;Rudder reviewed the operations order with (Maj. Gen. Clarence) Huebner (Bradley’s designee commanding all forces going to Omaha Beach and Pointe du Hoc) for the last time on May 28, three days before loading his men onto troopships for the crossing. Records kept by Huebner’s staff reveal no indication that they questioned the presence of the fabled guns.&quot;

===German counter-attacks===
The costliest part of the battle for Pointe du Hoc for the Rangers came after the successful cliff assault. Determined to hold the vital high ground, yet isolated from other Allied forces, the Rangers fended off several counter-attacks from the German 914th Grenadier Regiment. The 5th Ranger Battalion and elements of the 116th Infantry Regiment headed towards Pointe du Hoc from Omaha Beach. However, only twenty-three Rangers from the 5th were able to link up with the 2nd Rangers during the evening of 6 June 1944. During the night the Germans forced the Rangers into a smaller enclave along the cliff, and some were taken prisoner.

It was not until the morning of 8 June that the Rangers at Pointe du Hoc were finally relieved by the 2nd and 5th Rangers, plus the 1st Battalion of the 116th Infantry, accompanied by tanks from the 743rd Tank Battalion.

When the Rangers began suffering heavy losses, brief consideration was given to sending in the 84-man Marine Detachment aboard the battleship USS &quot;Texas&quot; on the morning of 7 June. At the last minute, word was passed down through the Army chain of command that no Marines would be allowed to go ashore, not even providing armed escort on landing craft ferrying Army troops or supplies.

==Aftermath==

At the end of the two-day action, the initial Ranger landing force of 225+ was reduced to about 90 fighting men. In the aftermath of the battle, some Rangers became convinced that French civilians had taken part in the fighting on the German side. A number of French civilians accused of shooting at US forces or of serving as artillery observers for the Germans were executed.

==Commemoration==
Pointe du Hoc now features a memorial and museum dedicated to the battle. Many of the original fortifications have been left in place and the site remains speckled with a number of bomb craters. On 11 January 1979 this 13-hectare field was transferred to American control, and the American Battle Monuments Commission was made responsible for its maintenance.

As part of the commemorations of the 75th anniversary of D-Day in 2019, members of the current 75th Ranger Regiment reenacted the climb in both period and modern uniforms.

<text>Jacques-Henri Laffite (; born 21 November 1943) is a French former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Laffite won six Formula One Grands Prix across 13 seasons.

Born and raised in Paris, Laffite trained as a racing driver with the Winfield Racing School at Magny-Cours in 1968. Laffite twice entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Ligier before making his Formula One debut at the 1974 German Grand Prix with Frank Williams. Laffite remained at Frank Williams through the season, scoring his maiden podium at the and winning the European Formula Two Championship with Martini. He moved to Ligier in , taking several podiums amongst his maiden pole position in Italy. Laffite retained his seat the following season, taking his maiden win at the . After a winless season in , Ligier constructed the highly-competitive JS11 in response to the ground effect era. Laffite won the opening two rounds of the season—including a grand slam at the —but ultimately finished the championship in fourth after suffering eight retirements. Laffite again finished fourth in the and championships, losing out on the latter by six points to Nelson Piquet and taking several wins across both. Laffite failed to finish 11 of 15 Grands Prix in , leaving for Williams at the end of the season. After two winless seasons with Williams, amongst further reliability issues, Laffite returned to Ligier in , scoring several podiums. At the 1986 British Grand Prix, Laffite was seriously injured in a multi-car collision that broke both of his legs. He subsequently retired from Formula One, having achieved six wins, seven pole positions, seven fastest laps and 32 podiums.

Outside of Formula One, Laffite was a race-winner in the World Sportscar Championship with Kauhsen, as well as in the BMW M1 Procar Championship with BMW. He competed in the World Touring Car Championship in 1987 with Alfa Corse, and the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft from 1990 to 1992. Laffite entered nine editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to across multiple classes. Upon retiring from motor racing, Laffite was a presenter for TF1 from 1997 to 2012.

==Early years==
Jacques-Henri Laffite was born in Paris on 21 November 1943. He attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school. He was trained as a racing driver in 1968 at Winfield Racing School in France.

==Formula One career==
Laffite debuted in Formula One in 1974 for Frank Williams&#x27; Iso–Marlboro team. The following year he raced for the same team, now named Williams, scoring a second place in the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring.


In Laffite moved to the French Ligier team, scoring 20 points and a pole position at the Italian Grand Prix. The next two seasons were transitional, although he managed to win his first Grand Prix at Anderstorp in the 1977 Swedish Grand Prix.

The 1979 season opened with Laffite winning the first two races. He fought for the World Championship title until the last races, but eventually placed only fourth, with 36 points. The following two seasons were similar, with two more fourth places in the Championship and a further three victories. In 1982, however, Laffite finished only 17th in the final classification, with only 5 points scored.

During the early 1980s, Laffite also made three end of season trips to Australia to race in the non-championship Australian Grand Prix. He failed to finish his first race in 1981 (he was lucky to start after his car hit the wall on the outside of the last turn of the short (1.609 km (1.000 mi)) Calder Park Raceway in qualifying, but his local crew were able to repair it for the race). He finished second to fellow Frenchman Alain Prost in 1982, and third behind Brazilian Roberto Moreno and Australian John Smith in 1983. In all of his pre-Formula One AGP drives, Laffite drove a Formula Pacific or Formula Mondial Ralt RT4 powered by a 1.6-litre Ford I4 engine.

Results in the next two seasons were not much better, when he moved back to England, again to race for Williams (11 and 5 points, respectively). Now in his forties, Laffite returned to Ligier in 1985: in that season he was on the podium three times (Great Britain, Germany and Australia), for a total of 16 points. In 1986 he scored 14 points including two more podium finishes in the first half of the season, but he broke both legs in a crash at the start of the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch and thereafter retired from Formula One, ending his career tied with Graham Hill for the most Grand Prix starts at 176. He was the most successful driver in Ligier&#x27;s history, having taken six of their nine wins.

As a result of Laffite&#x27;s injuries, new safety rules were enforced from the season that stated that in all cars the driver&#x27;s feet must be behind the front axle line.

==Post-Formula One career==
Laffite recovered from his injuries and later raced in touring cars, finishing 17th in the inaugural World Touring Car Championship driving an Alfa Romeo 75 for Alfa Corse as well as racing three seasons in the German-based DTM series.

He is now a television commentator for the French network TF1, best known for his reaction to the incident at the 1997 European Grand Prix in which Michael Schumacher collided with Jacques Villeneuve, and Laffite reacted with curse words on live television.

Laffite made his 2007 FIA GT3 European Championship debut at the 2008 Bucharest City Challenge, driving for AutoGT Racing Team.
In October 2008, at the age of 64, he tested a Renault R27 F1 car at the Paul Ricard circuit.

Laffite has two daughters: Camille and Margot, a sports journalist of Formula One on Canal+. He is also golf enthusiast, is a shareholder of Dijon-Bourgogne Golf.

Also deeply attached to the Creuse for Golf Fisheries and nature, he has a property in Creuse near Aubusson.

<doc id="701333" wikidata="Q1094166" url="?curid=701333" title="Nuclear fission product">
<text>Nuclear fission products are the atomic fragments left after a large atomic nucleus undergoes nuclear fission. Typically, a large nucleus like that of uranium fissions by splitting into two smaller nuclei, along with a few neutrons, the release of heat energy (kinetic energy of the nuclei), and gamma rays. The two smaller nuclei are the &quot;fission products&quot;. (See also Fission products (by element)).

About 0.2% to 0.4% of fissions are ternary fissions, producing a third light nucleus such as helium-4 (90%) or tritium (7%).

The fission products themselves are usually unstable and therefore radioactive. Due to being relatively neutron-rich for their atomic number, many of them quickly undergo beta decay. This releases additional energy in the form of beta particles, antineutrinos, and gamma rays. Thus, fission events normally result in beta and additional gamma radiation that begins immediately after, even though this radiation is not produced directly by the fission event itself.

The produced radionuclides have varying half-lives, and therefore vary in radioactivity. For instance, strontium-89 and strontium-90 are produced in similar quantities in fission, and each nucleus decays by beta emission. But 90Sr has a 30-year half-life, and 89Sr a 50.5-day half-life. Thus in the 50.5 days it takes half the 89Sr atoms to decay, emitting the same number of beta particles as there were decays, less than 0.4% of the 90Sr atoms have decayed, emitting only 0.4% of the betas. The radioactive emission rate is highest for the shortest lived radionuclides, although they also decay the fastest. Additionally, less stable fission products are less likely to decay to stable nuclides, instead decaying to other radionuclides, which undergo further decay and radiation emission, adding to the radiation output. It is these short lived fission products that are the immediate hazard of spent fuel, and the energy output of the radiation also generates significant heat which must be considered when storing spent fuel. As there are hundreds of different radionuclides created, the initial radioactivity level fades quickly as short lived radionuclides decay, but never ceases completely as longer lived radionuclides make up more and more of the remaining unstable atoms. In fact the short lived products are so predominant that 87 percent decay to stable isotopes within the first month after removal from the reactor core.

== Formation and decay ==
The sum of the atomic mass of the two atoms produced by the fission of one fissile atom is always less than the atomic mass of the original atom. This is because some of the mass is lost as free neutrons, and once kinetic energy of the fission products has been removed (i.e., the products have been cooled to extract the heat provided by the reaction), then the mass associated with this energy is lost to the system also, and thus appears to be &quot;missing&quot; from the cooled fission products.

Since the nuclei that can readily undergo fission are particularly neutron-rich (e.g. 61% of the nucleons in uranium-235 are neutrons), the initial fission products are often more neutron-rich than stable nuclei of the same mass as the fission product (e.g. stable zirconium-90 is 56% neutrons compared to unstable strontium-90 at 58%). The initial fission products therefore may be unstable and typically undergo beta decay to move towards a stable configuration, converting a neutron to a proton with each beta emission. (Fission products do not decay via alpha decay.)

A few neutron-rich and short-lived initial fission products decay by ordinary beta decay (this is the source of perceptible half life, typically a few tenths of a second to a few seconds), followed by immediate emission of a neutron by the excited daughter-product. This process is the source of so-called delayed neutrons, which play an important role in control of a nuclear reactor.

The first beta decays are rapid and may release high energy beta particles or gamma radiation. However, as the fission products approach stable nuclear conditions, the last one or two decays may have a long half-life and release less energy.

==Radioactivity over time==
Fission products have half-lives of 90 years (samarium-151) or less, except for seven long-lived fission products that have half lives of 211,100 years (technetium-99) or more. Therefore, the total radioactivity of a mixture of pure fission products decreases rapidly for the first several hundred years (controlled by the short-lived products) before stabilizing at a low level that changes little for hundreds of thousands of years (controlled by the seven long-lived products).

This behavior of pure fission products with actinides removed, contrasts with the decay of fuel that still contains actinides. This fuel is produced in the so-called &quot;open&quot; (i.e., no nuclear reprocessing) nuclear fuel cycle. A number of these actinides have half lives in the missing range of about 100 to 200,000 years, causing some difficulty with storage plans in this time-range for open cycle non-reprocessed fuels.

Proponents of nuclear fuel cycles which aim to consume all their actinides by fission, such as the Integral Fast Reactor and molten salt reactor, use this fact to claim that within 200 years, their fuel wastes are no more radioactive than the original uranium ore.

Fission products emit beta radiation, while actinides primarily emit alpha radiation. Many of each also emit gamma radiation.

== Yield ==


Each fission of a parent atom produces a different set of fission product atoms. However, while an individual fission is not predictable, the fission products are statistically predictable. The amount of any particular isotope produced per fission is called its yield, typically expressed as percent per parent fission; therefore, yields total to 200%, not 100%. (The true total is in fact slightly greater than 200%, owing to rare cases of ternary fission.)

While fission products include every element from zinc through the lanthanides, the majority of the fission products occur in two peaks. One peak occurs at about (expressed by atomic masses 85 through 105) strontium to ruthenium while the other peak is at about tellurium to neodymium (expressed by atomic masses 130 through 145). The yield is somewhat dependent on the parent atom and also on the energy of the initiating neutron.

In general the higher the energy of the state that undergoes nuclear fission, the more likely that the two fission products have similar mass. Hence, as the neutron energy increases and/or the energy of the fissile atom increases, the valley between the two peaks becomes more shallow.
For instance, the curve of yield against mass for 239Pu has a more shallow valley than that observed for 235U when the neutrons are thermal neutrons. The curves for the fission of the later actinides tend to make even more shallow valleys. In extreme cases such as 259Fm, only one peak is seen; this is a consequence of symmetric fission becoming dominant due to shell effects.

The adjacent figure shows a typical fission product distribution from the fission of uranium. Note that in the calculations used to make this graph, the activation of fission products was ignored and the fission was assumed to occur in a single moment rather than a length of time. In this bar chart results are shown for different cooling times (time after fission).
Because of the stability of nuclei with even numbers of protons and/or neutrons, the curve of yield against element is not a smooth curve but tends to alternate. Note that the curve against mass number is smooth.

== Production ==
Small amounts of fission products are naturally formed as the result of either spontaneous fission of natural uranium, which occurs at a low rate, or as a result of neutrons from radioactive decay or reactions with cosmic ray particles. The microscopic tracks left by these fission products in some natural minerals (mainly apatite and zircon) are used in fission track dating to provide the cooling (crystallization) ages of natural rocks. The technique has an effective dating range of 0.1 Ma to &gt;1.0 Ga depending on the mineral used and the concentration of uranium in that mineral.

About 1.5 billion years ago in a uranium ore body in Africa, a natural nuclear fission reactor operated for a few hundred thousand years and produced approximately 5 tonnes of fission products. These fission products were important in providing proof that the natural reactor had occurred.
Fission products are produced in nuclear weapon explosions, with the amount depending on the type of weapon.
The largest source of fission products is from nuclear reactors. In current nuclear power reactors, about 3% of the uranium in the fuel is converted into fission products as a by-product of energy generation. Most of these fission products remain in the fuel unless there is fuel element failure or a nuclear accident, or the fuel is reprocessed.

=== Power reactors ===

Commercial nuclear fission reactors are operated in the otherwise self-extinguishing prompt subcritical state. Certain fission products decay over seconds to minutes, producing additional delayed neutrons crucial to sustaining criticality. An example is bromine-87 with a half-life of about a minute. Operating in this delayed critical state, power changes slowly enough to permit human and automatic control. Analogous to fire dampers varying the movement of wood embers towards new fuel, control rods are moved as the nuclear fuel burns up over time.

In a nuclear power reactor, the main sources of radioactivity are fission products along with actinides and activation products. Fission products are most of the radioactivity for the first several hundred years, while actinides dominate roughly 103 to 105 years after fuel use.

Most fission products are retained near their points of production. They are important to reactor operation not only because some contribute delayed neutrons useful for reactor control, but some are neutron poisons that inhibit the nuclear reaction. Buildup of neutron poisons is a key to how long a given fuel element can be kept in the reactor. Fission product decay also generates heat that continues even after the reactor has been shut down and fission stopped. This decay heat requires removal after shutdown; loss of this cooling damaged the reactors at Three Mile Island and Fukushima.

If the fuel cladding around the fuel develops holes, fission products can leak into the primary coolant. Depending on the chemistry, they may settle within the reactor core or travel through the coolant system and chemistry control systems are provided to remove them. In a well-designed power reactor running under normal conditions, coolant radioactivity is very low.

The isotope responsible for most of the gamma exposure in fuel reprocessing plants (and the Chernobyl site in 2005) is caesium-137. Iodine-129 is a major radioactive isotope released from reprocessing plants. In nuclear reactors both caesium-137 and strontium-90 are found in locations away from the fuel because they&#x27;re formed by the beta decay of noble gases (xenon-137, with a 3.8-minute half-life, and krypton-90, with a 32-second half-life) which enable them to be deposited away from the fuel, e.g. on control rods.

==== Nuclear reactor poisons ====

Some fission products decay with the release of delayed neutrons, important to nuclear reactor control.

Other fission products, such as xenon-135 and samarium-149, have a high neutron absorption cross section. Since a nuclear reactor must balance neutron production and absorption rates, fission products that absorb neutrons tend to &quot;poison&quot; or shut the reactor down; this is controlled with burnable poisons and control rods. Build-up of xenon-135 during shutdown or low-power operation may poison the reactor enough to impede restart or interfere with normal control of the reaction during restart or restoration of full power. This played a major role in the Chernobyl disaster.

=== Nuclear weapons ===
Nuclear weapons use fission as either the partial or the main energy source. Depending on the weapon design and where it is exploded, the relative importance of the fission product radioactivity will vary compared to the activation product radioactivity in the total fallout radioactivity.

The immediate fission products from nuclear weapon fission are essentially the same as those from any other fission source, depending slightly on the particular nuclide that is fissioning. However, the very short time scale for the reaction makes a difference in the particular mix of isotopes produced from an atomic bomb.

For example, the 134Cs/137Cs ratio provides an easy method of distinguishing between fallout from a bomb and the fission products from a power reactor. Almost no caesium-134 is formed by nuclear fission (because xenon-134 is stable). The 134Cs is formed by the neutron activation of the stable 133Cs which is formed by the decay of isotopes in the isobar (A = 133). So in a momentary criticality, by the time that the neutron flux becomes zero too little time will have passed for any 133Cs to be present. While in a power reactor plenty of time exists for the decay of the isotopes in the isobar to form 133Cs, the 133Cs thus formed can then be activated to form 134Cs only if the time between the start and the end of the criticality is long.

According to Jiri Hala&#x27;s textbook, the radioactivity in the fission product mixture in an atom bomb is mostly caused by short-lived isotopes such as iodine-131 and barium-140. After about four months, cerium-141, zirconium-95/niobium-95, and strontium-89 represent the largest share of radioactive material. After two to three years, cerium-144/praseodymium-144, ruthenium-106/rhodium-106, and promethium-147 are responsible for the bulk of the radioactivity. After a few years, the radiation is dominated by strontium-90 and caesium-137, whereas in the period between 10,000 and a million years it is technetium-99 that dominates.

===Application===
Some fission products (such as 137Cs) are used in medical and industrial radioactive sources.
99TcO4− (pertechnetate) ion can react with steel surfaces to form a corrosion resistant layer. In this way these metaloxo anions act as anodic corrosion inhibitors - it renders the steel surface passive. The formation of 99TcO2 on steel surfaces is one effect which will retard the release of 99Tc from nuclear waste drums and nuclear equipment which has become lost prior to decontamination (e.g. nuclear submarine reactors which have been lost at sea).

In a similar way the release of radio-iodine in a serious power reactor accident could be retarded by adsorption on metal surfaces within the nuclear plant. Much of the other work on the iodine chemistry which would occur during a bad accident has been done.

== Decay ==

For fission of uranium-235, the predominant radioactive fission products include isotopes of iodine, caesium, strontium, xenon and barium. The threat becomes smaller with the passage of time. Locations where radiation fields once posed immediate mortal threats, such as much of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on day one of the accident and the ground zero sites of U.S. atomic bombings in Japan (6 hours after detonation) are now relatively safe because the radioactivity has decreased to a low level.
Many of the fission products decay through very short-lived isotopes to form stable isotopes, but a considerable number of the radioisotopes have half-lives longer than a day.

The radioactivity in the fission product mixture is initially mostly caused by short lived isotopes such as 131I and 140Ba; after about four months 141Ce, 95Zr/95Nb and 89Sr take the largest share, while after about two or three years the largest share is taken by 144Ce/144Pr, 106Ru/106Rh and 147Pm. Later 90Sr and 137Cs are the main radioisotopes, being succeeded by 99Tc. In the case of a release of radioactivity from a power reactor or used fuel, only some elements are released; as a result, the isotopic signature of the radioactivity is very different from an open air nuclear detonation, where all the fission products are dispersed.

== Fallout countermeasures ==
The purpose of radiological emergency preparedness is to protect people from the effects of radiation exposure after a nuclear accident or bomb. Evacuation is the most effective protective measure. However, if evacuation is impossible or even uncertain, then local fallout shelters and other measures provide the best protection.
=== Iodine ===

At least three isotopes of iodine are important. 129I, 131I (radioiodine) and 132I. Open air nuclear testing and the Chernobyl disaster both released iodine-131.

The short-lived isotopes of iodine are particularly harmful because the thyroid collects and concentrates iodide – radioactive as well as stable. Absorption of radioiodine can lead to acute, chronic, and delayed effects. Acute effects from high doses include thyroiditis, while chronic and delayed effects include hypothyroidism, thyroid nodules, and thyroid cancer. It has been shown that the active iodine released from Chernobyl and Mayak has resulted in an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in the former Soviet Union.

One measure which protects against the risk from radio-iodine is taking a dose of potassium iodide (KI) before exposure to radioiodine. The non-radioactive iodide &quot;saturates&quot; the thyroid, causing less of the radioiodine to be stored in the body.
Administering potassium iodide reduces the effects of radio-iodine by 99% and is a prudent, inexpensive supplement to fallout shelters. A low-cost alternative to commercially available iodine pills is a saturated solution of potassium iodide. Long-term storage of KI is normally in the form of reagent-grade crystals.

The administration of known goitrogen substances can also be used as a prophylaxis in reducing the bio-uptake of iodine, (whether it be the nutritional non-radioactive iodine-127 or radioactive iodine, radioiodine - most commonly iodine-131, as the body cannot discern between different iodine isotopes).
Perchlorate ions, a common water contaminant in the USA due to the aerospace industry, has been shown to reduce iodine uptake and thus is classified as a goitrogen. Perchlorate ions are a competitive inhibitor of the process by which iodide is actively deposited into thyroid follicular cells. Studies involving healthy adult volunteers determined that at levels above 0.007 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/(kg·d)), perchlorate begins to temporarily inhibit the thyroid gland&#x27;s ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream (&quot;iodide uptake inhibition&quot;, thus perchlorate is a known goitrogen).
The reduction of the iodide pool by perchlorate has dual effects – reduction of excess hormone synthesis and hyperthyroidism, on the one hand, and reduction of thyroid inhibitor synthesis and hypothyroidism on the other. Perchlorate remains very useful as a single dose application in tests measuring the discharge of radioiodide accumulated in the thyroid as a result of many different disruptions in the further metabolism of iodide in the thyroid gland.

Treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves&#x27; disease) with 600–2,000 mg potassium perchlorate (430-1,400 mg perchlorate) daily for periods of several months or longer was once common practice, particularly in Europe, and perchlorate use at lower doses to treat thyroid problems continues to this day. Although 400 mg of potassium perchlorate divided into four or five daily doses was used initially and found effective, higher doses were introduced when 400 mg/day was discovered not to control thyrotoxicosis in all subjects.

Current regimens for treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves&#x27; disease), when a patient is exposed to additional sources of iodine, commonly include 500 mg potassium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40 days.

Prophylaxis with perchlorate-containing water at concentrations of 17 ppm, which corresponds to 0.5 mg/kg-day personal intake, if one is 70 kg and consumes 2 litres of water per day, was found to reduce baseline radioiodine uptake by 67% This is equivalent to ingesting a total of just 35 mg of perchlorate ions per day. In another related study where subjects drank just 1 litre of perchlorate-containing water per day at a concentration of 10 ppm, i.e. daily 10 mg of perchlorate ions were ingested, an average 38% reduction in the uptake of iodine was observed.

However, when the average perchlorate absorption in perchlorate plant workers subjected to the highest exposure has been estimated as approximately 0.5 mg/kg-day, as in the above paragraph, a 67% reduction of iodine uptake would be expected. Studies of chronically exposed workers though have thus far failed to detect any abnormalities of thyroid function, including the uptake of iodine. this may well be attributable to sufficient daily exposure or intake of healthy iodine-127 among the workers and the short 8 hr biological half life of perchlorate in the body.

To completely block the uptake of iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a populace&#x27;s water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5 mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing radioiodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region&#x27;s water supply would need to be much higher, at least 7.15 mg/kg of body weight per day, or a water concentration of 250 ppm, assuming people drink 2 liters of water per day, to be truly beneficial to the population at preventing bioaccumulation when exposed to a radioiodine environment, independent of the availability of iodate or iodide drugs.

The continual distribution of perchlorate tablets or the addition of perchlorate to the water supply would need to continue for no less than 80–90 days, beginning immediately after the initial release of radioiodine was detected. After 80–90 days passed, released radioactive iodine-131 would have decayed to less than 0.1% of its initial quantity, at which time the danger from biouptake of iodine-131 is essentially over.

In the event of a radioiodine release, the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defense in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in the event of a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against carcinogenic radioiodine bioaccumulation.

The ingestion of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also not without its dangers, such as hypothyroidism. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate, or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine bioaccumulation in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.

=== Caesium ===
The Chernobyl accident released a large amount of caesium isotopes which were dispersed over a wide area. 137Cs is an isotope which is of long-term concern as it remains in the top layers of soil. Plants with shallow root systems tend to absorb it for many years. Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of 137Cs, which can be transferred to humans through the food chain.

One of the best countermeasures in dairy farming against 137Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the 137Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also the removal of top few centimeters of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the dose to humans and animals as the gamma rays from 137Cs will be attenuated by their passage through the soil. The deeper and more remote the trench is, the better the degree of protection.
Fertilizers containing potassium can be used to dilute cesium and limit its uptake by plants.

In livestock farming, another countermeasure against 137Cs is to feed to animals prussian blue. This compound acts as an ion-exchanger. The cyanide is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to consume several grams of prussian blue per day. The prussian blue reduces the biological half-life (different from the nuclear half-life) of the caesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of 137Cs is about 30 years. Caesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the prussian blue is that the caesium which is stripped from the animal in the droppings is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the caesium from being recycled. The form of prussian blue required for the treatment of animals, including humans is a special grade. Attempts to use the pigment grade used in paints have not been successful.

=== Strontium ===
The addition of lime to soils which are poor in calcium can reduce the uptake of strontium by plants. Likewise in areas where the soil is low in potassium, the addition of a potassium fertilizer can discourage the uptake of cesium into plants. However such treatments with either lime or potash should not be undertaken lightly as they can alter the soil chemistry greatly, so resulting in a change in the plant ecology of the land.

== Health concerns ==
For introduction of radionuclides into an organism, ingestion is the most important route. Insoluble compounds are not absorbed from the gut and cause only local irradiation before they are excreted. Soluble forms however show wide range of absorption percentages.

<doc id="701349" wikidata="Q63199" url="?curid=701349" title="Paul Troost">
<text>Paul Ludwig Troost (17 August 1878 – 21 January 1934) was a German architect. A favourite master builder of Adolf Hitler from 1930, his Neoclassical designs for the &quot;Führerbau&quot;, the &quot;Verwaltungsbau der NSDAP&quot; and the &quot;Haus der Kunst&quot; in Munich influenced the style of Nazi architecture.

==Life==
===Early career===
Born in Elberfeld in the Rhineland, Troost attended the Technical College of Darmstadt and, upon finishing his course, worked with Martin Dülfer in Munich beginning in 1920. He then qualified as a university lecturer. In the 1920s, he opened his own architectural office and became a member of the modernist &quot;Deutscher Werkbund&quot; association. Troost designed several rooms of Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam. After a trip to the United States in 1922, he designed steamship décor for the Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping company before World War I, and the fittings for transatlantic liners in a style that combined Spartan traditionalism with elements of modernity. He was in charge of design for all of the company&#x27;s largest ships, such as SS &quot;Europa&quot;, SS &quot;Berlin&quot;, SS &quot;München&quot;, and SS &quot;Homeric&quot;, until 1929.

An extremely tall, spare-looking, reserved Westphalian with a close-shaven head, Troost belonged to a school of architects like Peter Behrens and Walter Gropius who, even before 1914, reacted sharply against the highly ornamental &quot;Jugendstil&quot; movement and advocated a restrained, lean architectural approach, almost devoid of ornament.

===Hitler===
Troost and Hitler first met in 1929, through the Nazi publisher Hugo Bruckmann and his wife Elsa. Although before 1933 he did not belong to the leading group of German architects, Troost became Hitler&#x27;s foremost architect whose neo-classical style became for a time the official architecture of the Third Reich. His work filled Hitler with enthusiasm, and he planned and built state and municipal edifices throughout Germany.

Hitler commissioned Troost to convert the Barlow Palais in Munich into the headquarters of the Nazi Party, the &quot;Brown House&quot;, decorating it in a heavy, anti-modernist style under Hitler&#x27;s supervision.

In the autumn of 1933, he was commissioned to rebuild and refurnish Hitler&#x27;s dwellings in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Along with other architects like Ludwig Ruff, Troost planned and built State and municipal edifices throughout the country, including new administrative offices, social buildings for workers and bridges across the main highways. One of the many structures he planned before his death was the &quot;Haus der Deutschen Kunst&quot; (&quot;House of German Art&quot;) in Munich, modeled on Schinkel&#x27;s &quot;Altes Museum&quot; in Berlin. The museum was constructed from 1933 to 1937 following Troost&#x27;s plans, and was Nazi Germany&#x27;s first monumental structure of Nazi architecture. Hitler intended it to be a great temple for a &quot;true, eternal art of the German people&quot;. It was a good example of the imitation of classical forms in monumental public buildings during the Third Reich, though subsequently Hitler moved away from the more restrained style of Troost, reverting to the more elaborate imperial grandeur that he had admired in the 19th century Vienna Ring Road (&quot;Ringstraße&quot;) boulevard of his youth.

Troost also redesigned Königsplatz in Munich to include new Nazi Party buildings and a &quot;Temple of Honour&quot;.

Hitler&#x27;s relationship to Troost was that of a pupil to an admired teacher. According to Albert Speer, who later became Hitler&#x27;s favorite architect, the &quot;Führer&quot; would impatiently greet Troost with the words: &quot;I can&#x27;t wait, Herr Professor. Is there anything new? Let&#x27;s see it!&quot; Troost would then lay out his latest plans and sketches. Hitler frequently declared, according to Speer, that &quot;he first learned what architecture was from Troost&quot;&#x27;. The architect&#x27;s death on 21 January 1934, after a severe illness, was a painful blow, but Hitler remained close to his widow Gerdy Troost, whose architectural taste frequently coincided with his own, which made her (in Speer&#x27;s words) &quot;a kind of arbiter of art in Munich&quot;.

==Death==
Troost died on 21 January 1934 at the age of 55. Hitler posthumously awarded him the German National Prize for Art and Science in 1937. He was buried in the Munich &quot;Nordfriedhof&quot; (Northern Cemetery). The gravestone still survives.

<doc id="701372" wikidata="Q357291" url="?curid=701372" title="Alfredo Kraus">
<text>Alfredo Kraus Trujillo (; 24 November 192710 September 1999) was a distinguished Spanish tenor from the Canary Islands (known professionally as Alfredo Kraus), particularly known for the artistry he brought to opera&#x27;s bel canto roles. He was also considered an outstanding interpreter of the title role in Massenet&#x27;s opera &quot;Werther&quot;, and especially of its famous aria, &quot;Pourquoi me réveiller?&quot;

==Early years==
Kraus was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. His father was Austrian and his mother was Spanish. He began his musical career with piano lessons at the age of four, and he sang in the school choir by age eight. His older brother, Francisco Kraus Trujillo, a baritone, studied music and opera alongside him.

==Career== 
After refining his technique singing Spanish zarzuela on stage in Madrid and Barcelona, Kraus made his professional opera debut in Cairo during 1956 as the Duke in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, which became one of his signature roles. In 1958, he sang Alfredo at the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lisbon in a production of &quot;La traviata&quot; with Maria Callas, a live recording of which was later released.

Kraus made his Covent Garden debut as Edgardo in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; in 1959 and his La Scala debut as Elvino in &quot;La sonnambula&quot; in 1960. He made his American debut with Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1962, and his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1966 in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, the role of his last performance there in 1994.

In subsequent decades, Kraus extended his repertoire to include more Italian operas such as &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;, &quot;Linda di Chamounix&quot;, &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; and &quot;La favorita&quot; by Donizetti; and French operas such as &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;Lakmé&quot;, while continuing to sing his hallmark roles of &quot;Werther&quot; and of Des Grieux in &quot;Manon&quot;. He also recorded a number of rarely performed French operas including &quot;La jolie fille de Perth&quot; and &quot;Les pêcheurs de perles&quot;, both by Georges Bizet, and &quot;La muette de Portici&quot; by Daniel Auber. He also performed in some very well known works, such as &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;Faust&quot;.

Kraus came to be virtually synonymous with such lyric tenor roles as Werther, Faust, Don Ottavio (&quot;Don Giovanni&quot;), Nemorino, and Arturo. He was also known for his performances of Spanish music, notably many classics from the zarzuela repertoire, which he continued to perform live on stage in Spain until the end of his career, and many of which he recorded complete for EMI Spain as well as for his own label, Carillon.

==Technique==
Thanks to his superlative technique and careful husbanding of his vocal resources, Kraus sang onstage until his early 70s. He studied voice technique in Milan with Mercedes Llopart. 
Kraus was also noted for extremely refined musicianship, accompanied by a seemingly effortless high register. As a result, many opera connoisseurs consider him to be one of the best tenors of the end of the 20th century. He was admired for his cultivated musical education and his complete respect for his chosen profession. His first priority was the integrity of his artistic interpretation of a piece, rather than his formidable range and excellent technique.

He performed all over the world, including the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Teatro Municipal in Caracas, Teatro Municipal in Santiago, Chile, Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, and the Liceu in Barcelona.

In 1991, Kraus was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award. In 1997, his home city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria opened The Alfredo Kraus Auditorium in his honor.

==Later years==

The loss of his wife in 1997 affected Kraus so deeply that he stopped performing for eight months. A proud and strong-willed man, he eventually returned to the stage and to teaching. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t have the will for singing but I must do it, because, in a sense, it is a sign that I have overcome the tragedy. Singing is a form of admitting that I&#x27;m alive.&quot;

Kraus died on 10 September 1999 in Madrid, at the age of 71, after a long illness.

<doc id="701380" wikidata="Q565410" url="?curid=701380" title="Economic regions of Russia">
<text>Russia is divided into twelve economic regions — groups of federal subjects sharing the following characteristics:

*Common economic and social goals and participation in development programs;
*Relatively similar economic conditions and potential;
*Similar climatic, ecological, and geological conditions;
*Similar methods of technical inspection of new construction;
*Similar methods of conducting customs oversight;
*Overall similar living conditions of the population.

No federal subject can belong to more than one economic region.

Economic regions are also grouped into economic zones (also called &quot;macrozones&quot;). An economic region or its parts can belong to more than one economic zone.

Establishment and abolition of economic regions and economic zones or any changes in their composition are decided upon by the federal government of Russia.

This division into economic regions is different from the division into federal districts. The former are solely for economic and statistical purposes, and the latter exist solely to uphold the federal laws on the territory of the country.

<doc id="701387" wikidata="Q55589" url="?curid=701387" title="Zhe (Cyrillic)">
<text>Zhe, Zha, or Zhu, sometimes transliterated as Že (Ж ж; italics: &quot;Ж&quot; &quot;ж&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiced retroflex sibilant () or voiced postalveolar fricative /ʒ/, like the pronunciation of the in &quot;measure&quot;. It is also often used with D (Д) to approximate the sound in English of the Latin letter J with a ДЖ combination. Zhe is romanized as , or .

==History==
It is not known how the character for Zhe was derived. No similar letter exists in Greek, Latin or any other alphabet of the time, though there is some graphic similarity with its Glagolitic counterpart Zhivete (Image: ) which represents the same sound. However, the origin of Zhivete, like that of most Glagolitic letters, is unclear.

One possibility is that it was formed from the pronunciation of Hebrew letter Zayin combined with the Hebrew letter Shin letter, to eventually form the Modern Hebrew letter of Zhayin , with a geresh on top for distinction.

Zhe may also be derived from the Coptic letter ⟨⟩, supported by the phonetic value ( represents the sound /d͡ʒ/ in Coptic) and shape of the letter, which the Glagolitic counterpart Zhivete resembles even more closely. The form of the letter also may be derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph depicting a drill:
U29\

It may be a ligature, formed from combining two &quot;K&quot; letters (one backward form) sharing a common stem.

Some Ukrainian scholars argue that it is shape of beetle, since Zhe is the first phoneme in the Slavic word (&quot;žuk&quot;), meaning &quot;beetle&quot;.

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet the name of Zhe was (&quot;živěte&quot;), meaning &quot;live&quot; (imperative).

Zhe was not used in the Cyrillic numeral system.

==Usage==
Zhe is used in the alphabets of all Slavic languages using a Cyrillic alphabet, and of most non-Slavic languages which use a Cyrillic alphabet. The position in the alphabet and the sound represented by the letter vary from language to language.

Zhe can also be used in Leet speak or faux Cyrillic in place of the letter , or to represent the symbol of the rap duo Kris Kross (a ligature of two back-to-back letter K&#x27;s).

==Transliteration==
Ж is most often transliterated as the digraph for English-language readers (as in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, Доктор Живаго, or Georgy Zhukov, Георгий Жуков). In linguistics and for Central European readers, it is most often transliterated as , with a háček. The scientific transliteration convention comes from Czech spelling and is also used in the Latin alphabets of several other Slavic languages (Slovak, Sorbian, Serbo-Croatian and Slovene). Thus, Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s surname (Леонид Брежнев) could be transliterated as &quot;Brežnev&quot;, as it is spelled in a number of Slavic languages. Polish uses its own convention for transliteration of Cyrillic according to which ж is transliterated with the Polish letter ż (which is pronounced in Polish). Ж is often transliterated in Mongolian because of its pronunciation as .

<doc id="701408" wikidata="Q302750" url="?curid=701408" title="Life of Galileo">
<text>Life of Galileo (), also known as Galileo, is a play by the 20th century German dramatist Bertolt Brecht and collaborator Margarete Steffin with incidental music by Hanns Eisler. The play was written in 1938 and received its first theatrical production (in German) at the Zurich Schauspielhaus, opening on the 9th of September 1943. This production was directed by Leonard Steckel, with set-design by Teo Otto. The cast included Steckel himself (as Galileo), Karl Paryla and Wolfgang Langhoff.

The second (or &quot;American&quot;) version was written in English between 1945–1947 in collaboration with Charles Laughton, and opened at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles on 30 July 1947. It was directed by Joseph Losey and Brecht, with musical direction by Serge Hovey and set-design by Robert Davison. Laughton played Galileo, with Rusty Lane as Barberini and Joan McCracken as Virginia. This production opened at the Maxine Elliott&#x27;s Theatre in New York on 7 December of the same year.

In 1955 Brecht prepared a third version. A production, by the Berliner Ensemble with Ernst Busch in the title role, opened in January 1957 at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm and was directed by Erich Engel, with set-design by Caspar Neher. The play was first published in 1940.

The action of the play follows the career of the great Italian natural philosopher Galileo Galilei and the Galileo affair, in which he was tried by the Roman Catholic Church for the promulgation of his scientific discoveries. The play embraces such themes as the conflict between dogmatism and scientific evidence, as well as interrogating the values of constancy in the face of oppression.

== Versions of the play ==
After immigrating to the United States from Hitler&#x27;s Germany (with stopovers in various other countries in between, among them the USSR), Brecht translated and re-worked the first version of his play in collaboration with the actor Charles Laughton. The result of their efforts was the second, &quot;American version&quot; of the play, entitled simply &quot;Galileo&quot;, which to this day remains the most widely staged version in the English-speaking world. This version differed in tone from the original, as Brecht felt that the optimistic portrait of the scientific project present in the first version required revision in a post-Hiroshima world, where science&#x27;s harmful potential had become more apparent. This second version formed the basis for Losey&#x27;s 1975 film adaptation for American Film Theatre under the title &quot;Galileo&quot; with Topol in the title role.

In September 1947, Brecht was subpoenaed in the US by the House Un-American Activities Committee for alleged communist connections. He testified before HUAC on 30 October 1947, and flew to Europe on 31 October. He chose to return to East Germany and continued to work on the play, now once again in the German language. The final German version premiered at Cologne in April 1955.

Matej Danter offers a readily-accessible and detailed comparison of the early, the American, and the final German versions.

A Scottish Theatre Company production of the Laughton translation, directed by Peter Dews, toured Scottish theatres in the autumn of 1985, with Tom Fleming in the title role.

In 2013 the Royal Shakespeare Company performed a new version of the play based on a &quot;pared down&quot; translation by Mark Ravenhill; the Swan Theatre production received a favorable review from the veteran theater critic Michael Billington.

== Synopsis ==

Galileo, an eminent professor and scientist in Padua, a city in the 17th century Venetian Republic, is short of money. A prospective student, named Ludovico Marsali, tells him about a novel invention, the telescope (&quot;a queer tube thing&quot;), that is being sold in Amsterdam. Afterwards, the procurator of Padua University enters and informs Galileo that he cannot approve his application for a raise unless Galileo can produce inventions with practical applications. When Galileo protests that he will be unable to pursue his theoretical research into astronomy if he focuses on business pursuits, the procurator points out that his research into astronomy would be deemed heretical in other parts of Italy and that Venice provides greater academic freedom to scientists because Venetian merchants and industrialists seek to profit from the scientific advances. 

Galileo realizes that he must appease his sponsors, replicates the Dutch telescope invention, and presents it to the leaders of Venice as his own creation. Galileo&#x27;s daughter, Virginia, and Ludovico congratulate Galileo on his &quot;invention&quot; which Galileo claims is much improved from the Dutch version and Ludovico wryly responds that Galileo&#x27;s is red rather than green. After presenting the telescope, Galileo receives an increase in his salary from the University and the procurator tells Galileo that the financial incentive was necessary to elicit inventions, but within a short time, the procurator discovers Galileo&#x27;s ruse and is upset to have been publicly made a fool.

Galileo then uses the telescope for careful observations of the Moon and the planets, and he discovers the moons orbiting Jupiter. He makes plans to seek the sponsorship of the Medici Court in Florence where he hopes to be able to focus more on his writing and research, but his close friend and colleague, Sagredo, pleads with him not to leave Venice since the rest of Italy is dominated by clerics. His astronomical observations strongly support Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric model of the Solar System, which is counter to popular belief, Aristotelian physics and the established doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. When doubters quote scripture and Aristotle to him, Galileo pleads with them to look in his telescope and trust the observations of their eyes; they refuse.

Virginia&#x27;s years long engagement to Ludovico Marsali, a wealthy young man whom she genuinely loves, is broken because of Galileo&#x27;s reluctance to distance himself from his unorthodox teachings. He furthermore publishes his views in vernacular Italian, rather than traditional scientific Latin, thus making his work and conclusions more accessible to the common people, enraging the Church. Galileo is brought to the Vatican in Rome for interrogation by the Inquisition. Upon being threatened with torture, he recants his teachings. His students are shocked by his surrender in the face of pressure from the church authorities.

Galileo, old and broken, now living under house arrest with a priest monitoring his activities, is visited by one of his former pupils, Andrea. Galileo gives him a book (&quot;Two New Sciences&quot;) containing all his scientific discoveries, asking him to smuggle it out of Italy for dissemination abroad. Andrea now believes Galileo&#x27;s actions were heroic and that he just recanted to fool the ecclesiastical authorities. However, Galileo insists his actions had nothing to do with heroism but were merely the result of self-interest.

==Historical background==
The play stays generally faithful to Galileo&#x27;s science and timeline thereof, but takes significant liberties with his personal life. Galileo did in fact use a telescope, observe the moons of Jupiter, advocate for the heliocentric model, observe sunspots, investigate buoyancy, and write on physics, and did visit the Vatican twice to defend his work, the second time being made to recant his views, and being confined to house arrest thereafter.

One significant liberty that is taken is the treatment of Galileo&#x27;s daughter Virginia Gamba (Sister Maria Celeste), who, rather than becoming engaged, was considered unmarriageable by her father and confined to a convent from the age of thirteen (the bulk of the play), and, further, died of dysentery shortly after her father&#x27;s recantation. However, Galileo was close with Virginia, and they corresponded extensively.

The play, written in 1938, also took place in the aftermath of some of the most sensational of the Moscow Trials, where many Old Bolsheviks, considered heroes of the Russian Revolution by many left-wing activists and Communist sympathisers, were suddenly accused, and then themselves confessed, to acts of sabotage, espionage, terrorism, and collaboration with Nazi Germany and other Western capitalist governments. These allegations often took forms most fantastical and outlandish, making comparisons with the Catholic Inquisition obvious. Some consider &quot;The Life of Galileo&quot; to be inspired by these events which had captured the world&#x27;s attention for nearly 2 years.

==Allusions==
There are a number of allusions to Galileo&#x27;s science and to Marxism which are not further elaborated in the play; some of these are noted below.

The discussion of &quot;price&quot; versus &quot;value&quot; was a major point of debate in 19th century economics, under the terms exchange value versus use value. Within Marxian economics this is discussed under the labor theory of value.

More subtly, Marx is sometimes interpreted as advocating technological determinism (technological progress determines social change), which is reflected in the telescope (a technological change) being the root of the scientific progress and hence social unrest.

Questions about motivations for academic pursuits are often raised, with Galileo seeking knowledge for knowledge&#x27;s sake and his supporters focused on monetizing his discoveries through star charts and industry applications. There is a tension between Galileo&#x27;s pure love of science and his sponsors who only fund and protect his research because they wish to profit from it.

The mention of tides refers to Galileo&#x27;s theory that the motion of the Earth caused the tides, which would give the desired physical proof of the Earth&#x27;s movement, and which is discussed in his &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,&quot; whose working title was &quot;Dialogue on the Tides.&quot; In actuality Galileo was wrong. Kepler correctly believed that the Moon&#x27;s gravity caused the tides.

The bent wooden rail in scene 13 and the discussion that the quickest distance between two points need not be a straight line (though a straight line offers the &quot;shortest&quot; path, the fastest descent of a rolling ball in fact follows a curve) alludes to Galileo&#x27;s investigation of the brachistochrone (in the context of the quickest descent from a point to a wall), which he incorrectly believed to be given by a quarter circle. Instead, the brachistochrone is a half cycloid, which was only proven much later with the development of calculus.

<text>Peter John Wheeler, CBE (born 26 November 1948) is a former international rugby union player who played hooker and was Chief Executive of Leicester Tigers.

==Early life==
Wheeler attended Brockley County Grammar School and went on to play for Old Brockleians Rugby Club and Kent for three seasons.

==Playing career==
Wheeler was considered a tough and technically proficient hooker and was integral to Leicester&#x27;s innovative and expansive style of play. Wheeler captained Leicester Tigers to three consecutive wins in the John Player Cup from 1979 to 1981 and played 349 games for the club from 1969 to 1985.

He was an early advocate of league rugby in the 1980s.

He made his England debut on 1 February 1975 against France, and his last appearance on 17 March 1984 against Wales, gaining 41 caps in between, including 5 as captain.

He went on the 1977 British Lions tour to New Zealand and the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa.

==Rugby administration==

Wheeler coached Tigers in the inaugural league season which ended with them as champions. He then joined the Tigers organising committee.

When open professionalism was declared in 1996 he was appointed the Chief Executive of Leicester Tigers and held the position until 2010 when he was appointed &quot;Rugby Director&quot;, though this saw little change to his day to day role. He retired in 2015 and was made a life member of Leicester, who he had served in various roles over 40 years.

<doc id="701417" wikidata="Q16997963" url="?curid=701417" title="Juno Online Services">
<text>Juno Online Services, also called simply Juno, is an Internet service provider based in the United States. It originated as a free email service and later expanded its offerings. Juno is a subsidiary of United Online, which in turn is a subsidiary of investment bank B. Riley Financial. United Online is also the parent of NetZero and BlueLight Internet Services.

==History==

Juno was founded in May 1996 by Charles Ardai, Brian Marsh and Clifford Tse, with equity capital provided by the D. E. Shaw Group and headquarters in the same Midtown Manhattan building as Shaw. In August 1996, it began a free e-mail service — a customer would install the proprietary Juno client which would allow them to send and receive email of about 35 kilobytes in size. Version 1 did not offer attachments or other features. The user could write emails with the Juno client and would periodically sign in by dial-up. Upon doing so, the Juno client would upload any emails the user had written, download any new incoming emails in the online mailbox, and download targeted advertisements, which were displayed in the client. This was similar to &quot;QWK&quot; and similar less automated offline readers that had been used for years by BBSes to save phone line connect time.

In June 1998, Juno expanded its service to offer premium support for paying subscribers, and added the ability to browse the web in addition to use of email. In December 1999, Juno began to offer the same service (without technical support) for free, provided the user ran the Juno client, which displayed a bar containing advertisements for the majority of the time that the user was online. Juno later imposed limits on how much usage could be made of its free Internet service in a single month. Free service was limited, as of the middle of July 2015, to a maximum of 10 hours per month.

With the collapse of the 1990s Dot-com bubble, Internet advertising revenues declined and the company shifted emphasis to offering discount Web and mail services similar to large ISPs, but at half the price.

Juno stock began trading on NASDAQ in May 1999, under the symbol JWEB. In June 2001, Juno and NetZero, which also traded on NASDAQ but under the symbol NZRO, announced a merger. The two had been in litigation over the patent which NetZero held to provide free Internet access by using an Ad bar. Though NetZero held the said patent, Juno had six million members, and thus was far larger. Eventually, they chose to merge rather than continue to fight in court. By September 2001, the two companies were merged into the present-day United Online, and both JWEB and NZRO were delisted.

Juno released, along with NetZero, a service that purported to make web browsing faster. It displayed pictures at lower resolutions, thereby speeding page loads.

In 2001, Juno enacted a new version of their privacy policy. By continuing to use the service, customers implicitly agreed to allow Juno to harvest any unused CPU cycles. The plan was to assemble a quasi supercomputer using customers processors and sell computing services to private companies. This additional revenue was intended to keep the company afloat after the dot-com bubble. Most customers did not notice the change of terms. Though a customer for the Juno Virtual Supercomputer service was announced, it remained unclear, as of the middle of July 2015, whether the company followed through on this plan.

== Proprietary client ==

The Juno client software icon.
The client software was updated many times in the late 1990s. Version 1.49 was final for Windows 3.1, except for a date problem that was fixed in version 1.51. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.0.33 were final for Windows 95 and later. Version 4 had attachments and a spell checker, and displayed fonts and colors. For old messages, it had storage folders, each stored in a separate file containing up to 1000 messages.

Version 5 added an ineffective integral twit/spam filter and the ability to write messages in chosen fonts and colors with inline images. It stored its old messages in a different format, with one large file for all messages. When disk free space was not several times larger than the message file, it often suffered &quot;folder collapse&quot; in which all messages returned to the &quot;Inbox&quot; or disappeared.

As of December 1, 2004, use of an e-mail client such as the Juno client, Microsoft Outlook Express, or Eudora had ceased to be free. Users who wished to use an e-mail client instead of Juno&#x27;s web-based e-mail interface were required to pay for either Juno Platinum or Juno Megamail.

The Juno client software&#x27;s version 5.0, build 33, would not work with Internet Explorer 7. However, by the time Microsoft released the final version of IE7, Juno had released Juno 5.0 build 49, which resolved the issues with IE7 and made it compatible with Windows Vista.

Version 8, compatible with Windows 7, was released in 2009. The proprietary mailers were only slightly supported in the 21st century, and the service supported POP3 standard mail clients.

No version of Juno&#x27;s offline mail reader was made to use third party utilities to scan for viruses or clean out E-mail spam among messages that had already been downloaded. Versions 5 and 8 &quot;could&quot; weed downloaded email messages individually by exact email address matches; however, there were no wildcards, boolean exclusion-filters, or routing features to facilitate this. The company opened a spamdesk to help screen spam at the servers, thus minimizing the amount of spam received by the Juno client.

While the Juno client software could back up e-mails and addresses, it did not support exporting these to other clients, nor did other clients support importing from Juno. Only a handful of third-party utilities were made that could do anything with the proprietary message storage format; instead, users were forced to use third party applications to convert and export the data, principally juno5bdb for messages (which Juno stored in a Berkeley DB), and Dawn for addresses.

== Development centers ==
Juno also opened an offshore development center at Hyderabad, India, which it called United Online Software Development India Pvt. Ltd.

<doc id="701421" wikidata="Q1026867" url="?curid=701421" title="Reykjahlíð">
<text>Reykjahlíð () is a village situated on the shores of Lake Mývatn in the north of Iceland. It is the seat of the municipality of Skútustaðahreppur. It has 227 inhabitants as of 2021. &quot;With an elevation of 292 meters above sea level it ranks as the highest situated town in the nation.&quot;

==Overview==
During the so-called Mývatn fires, caused by the eruption of the nearby volcano Krafla in 1729, the village was destroyed by a lava stream. However, the inhabitants were saved when the lava flow stopped in front of the village church on higher ground, allegedly as the result of the prayers of the village priest. The church is still there, although the present building dates from 1972.

==Main sights==
From Reykjahlíð, it is possible to go to many sights in the area, most notably Krafla. The volcano last erupted in 1984, but the vapour of a warm lava field and of sulphur springs can still be seen. Not far from there is the crater Víti (meaning &quot;hell&quot; in Icelandic), but looking today rather harmless with a blue lake at its bottom. Its apparent tranquility belies the fact that its last eruption was as recent as 1976.

Other interesting places are on the lake itself, like the volcano Hverfjall, the pseudo-craters of Skútusstaðir and Dimmuborgir (a strange lava formation).

A local airport provides sightseeing during the summer.

A plant for extraction and processing of diatomite was a main point in local economy until 2004 when it was shut down.

Mývatn Nature Baths opened on 30 June 2004.

==Climate==
Reykjahlíð features a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification: ET), bordering on a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfc). Summers are typically cool with crisp nights while winters are very long and cold, but not severely cold.

Extreme temperatures ranged from on March 7, 1998 to on August 10, 2004.

<text>Northwood Hills is a London Underground station on the Metropolitan line in Northwood in North West London between Northwood and Pinner stations and is in Travelcard Zone 6.

==History==
The station opened on 13 November 1933. There was a competition for the name and Northwood Hills, suggested by a woman from North Harrow was the winning entry. The area is lower than Northwood, despite the name.

==Services==
In the northbound direction, the station is served by trains to Watford (4tph), Amersham (2tph) and Chesham (2tph) trains (at peak times, &#x27;fast&#x27; trains do not stop at stations between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Moor Park). In the southbound direction, off-peak services generally run 2tph to Wembley Park, 4tph to Baker Street, and 4tph to Aldgate.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 282, H11 (alighting at Northwood Hills Circus) and H13 serve the station.

<doc id="701437" wikidata="Q2314755" url="?curid=701437" title="Alexander Obolensky">
<text>Prince Alexander Sergeevich Obolensky (; 17 February 1916 – 29 March 1940) was a Rurikid prince of Russian aristocratic descent who became a naturalised Briton, having spent most of his life in England, and who went on to represent England in international rugby union. He was, and remains, popularly known as &quot;The Flying Prince&quot;, &quot;The Flying Slav&quot;, or simply as &quot;Obo&quot; to many sports fans.

==Biography==
A member of the Rurik dynasty, Obolensky was born at Petrograd (&quot;now&quot; Saint Petersburg) on 17 February 1916, the son of Prince Sergei Alexandrovich Obolensky, an officer in the Tsar&#x27;s Imperial Horse Guards and his wife Princess Lyubov Obolenskaya (&quot;née&quot; Naryshkina). The family name derives from the ancient Russian city of Obolensk; they fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and settled in Muswell Hill, London.

Obolensky was educated at The Ashe Boys&#x27; Preparatory School, Etwall and Trent College, Long Eaton, both in Derbyshire, before going up to Brasenose College, Oxford in Michaelmas 1934, where he held a college exhibition and read Politics, Philosophy and Economics; he graduated with a Fourth Class degree (BA (Oxon)) in 1938. He was also appointed a Knight of St John in 1938.

At Oxford he won two rugby blues representing Oxford University RFC as a wing/three-quarter. Having previously played for Chesterfield RFC whilst still at school, he played for Leicester Tigers between 1934 and 1939, as well as Rosslyn Park FC; his selection for England caused a stir because he was not a British subject, although he was naturalised British in March 1936.

On 4 January 1936. Obolensky scored two tries on his England debut in a 13–0 victory over the All Blacks, the first time England had beaten New Zealand. Aided by Pathé News footage of the game, his name has entered into legend, since the first try, beating several All Blacks in a run of three-quarters of the length of the field, was widely regarded as the greatest try of the time, and one of the greatest tries ever scored by England.

Prince Obolensky won three England caps later that year (against Wales on 18 January, Ireland on 8 February and Scotland on 21 March), but scored no further tries. He was selected as a member of the touring party for the 1936 British Lions tour to Argentina. He also played seven games for the &quot;invitation only&quot; Barbarian F.C. between 1937 and 1939, scoring three tries.

On 12 August 1939, Obolensky was commissioned as an Acting Pilot Officer in 615 Squadron (Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF)), being stationed at RAF Kenley and at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he joined RAF 504 Squadron.

===Death===
On 29 March 1940, a day after being recalled to the England squad to play Wales, Pilot Officer Obolensky was killed during training when his Hawker Hurricane Mark 1 overshot the runway at Martlesham Heath Airfield, Suffolk. His aircraft, reference number L1946, dropped into a dip at the end of the runway during landing, breaking his neck. Aged 24, Obolensky was buried at Ipswich New Cemetery.

==Legacy==
*The &quot;Obolensky Lecture&quot; is given annually on the subject of rugby football, and at Twickenham there is a suite named &quot;Obolensky&#x27;s&quot; in his honour.
*In February 2008 a project was launched in Ipswich to erect a permanent memorial, resulting in a £50,000 statue being unveiled on 18 February 2009 by his niece, Princess Alexandra Obolensky; the statue by Harry Gray stands on Cromwell Square in the town.
*A building is named in his memory at his former school, Trent College.
*The &quot;Prince Obolensky Award&quot; is presented annually by the Prince Obolensky Association at Rosslyn Park F.C.

<doc id="701438" wikidata="Q43263" url="?curid=701438" title="Federal subjects of Russia">
<text>The federal subjects of Russia, also referred to as the subjects of the Russian Federation () or simply as the subjects of the federation (), are the constituent entities of Russia, its top-level political divisions. According to the Constitution of Russia, the federation consists of republics, krais, oblasts, cities of federal importance, an autonomous oblast, and autonomous okrugs, all of which are equal subjects of the federation.

Every federal subject has its own head, a parliament, and a constitutional court. Each subject has its own constitution or charter and legislation, although the authority of these organs differ. Subjects have equal rights in relations with federal government bodies. The subjects have equal representation – two delegates each – in the Federation Council, the upper house of the Federal Assembly. They differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy; republics are offered more autonomy.

Post-Soviet Russia formed during the history of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic within the USSR and did not change at the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1992, during the so-called &quot;parade of sovereignties&quot;, separatist sentiments and the War of Laws within Russia, the Russian regions signed the Federation Treaty (), establishing and regulating the current inner composition of Russia, based on the division of authorities and powers among Russian government bodies and government bodies of constituent entities. The Federation Treaty was included in the text of the 1978 Constitution of the Russian SFSR. The current Constitution of Russia, adopted by federal referendum on 12 December 1993, came into force on 25 December 1993 and abolished the model of the Soviet system of government introduced in 1918 by Vladimir Lenin and based on the right to secede from the country and on unlimited sovereignty of federal subjects (in practice secession was never allowed), which conflicts with the country&#x27;s integrity and federal laws. The new constitution eliminated a number of legal conflicts, reserved the rights of the regions, introduced local self-government and did not grant the Soviet-era right to secede from the country. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the political system became &quot;de jure&quot; closer to other modern federal states with a republican form of government. In the 2000s, following the policies of Vladimir Putin and of the ruling United Russia party, the Russian parliament changed the distribution of tax revenues, reduced the number of elections in the regions and gave more power to the federal authorities.

The Russian Federation was composed of 89 federal subjects in 1993. Mergers reduced the number to 83 by 2008. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, with the Russian government claiming Sevastopol and the Republic of Crimea to be the 84th and 85th federal subjects of Russia, a move that is not recognized internationally. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia claimed that it had annexed four Ukrainian oblasts, though they remain internationally recognized as part of Ukraine and are only partially occupied by Russia.

==Terminology==
An official government translation of the Constitution of Russia from Russian to English uses the term &quot;constituent entities of the Russian Federation&quot;. For example, Article 5 reads: &quot;The Russian Federation shall consist of republics, krais, oblasts, cities of federal significance, an autonomous oblast, and autonomous okrugs, which shall have equal rights as constituent entities of the Russian Federation.&quot; A translation provided by Garant-Internet instead uses the term &quot;subjects of the Russian Federation&quot;.

Tom Fennell, a translator, told the 2008 American Translators Association conference that &quot;constituent entity of the Russian Federation&quot; is a better translation than &quot;subject&quot;. This was supported by Tamara Nekrasova, Head of Translation Department at Goltsblat BLP, who said in a 2011 presentation at a translators conference that &quot;&quot;constituent entity of the Russian Federation&quot; is more appropriate than &quot;subject of the Russian Federation&quot; (&quot;subject&quot; would be OK for a monarchy)&quot;.

==Types==































Each federal subject belongs to one of the following types:
==List==

===Notes===

a. The largest city is also listed when it is different from the capital/administrative centre.

b. According to Article 13 of the Charter of Leningrad Oblast, the governing bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Saint Petersburg. However, Saint Petersburg is not officially the administrative centre of the oblast.

c. According to Article 24 of the Charter of Moscow Oblast, the governing bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Moscow and throughout the territory of Moscow Oblast. However, Moscow is not officially the administrative centre of the oblast.

d. Internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.

e. In February 2000, the former code of 20 for the Chechen Republic was cancelled and replaced with code 95. License plate production was suspended due to the Chechen Wars, causing numerous issues, which in turn forced the region to use a new code.

f. Claimed, but only partially controlled by Russia.

g. As Russia only partially controls the region, this is a claimed figure.

==Mergers, splits and internal territorial changes ==

Starting in 2005, some of the federal subjects were merged into larger territories. In this process, six very sparsely populated subjects (comprising in total 0.3% of the population of Russia) were integrated into more populated subjects, with the hope that the economic development of those territories would benefit from the much larger means of their neighbours. The merging process was finished on 1 March 2008. No new mergers have been planned since March 2008. The six territories became &quot;administrative-territorial regions with special status&quot;. They have large proportions of minorities, with Russians being a majority only in three of them. Four of those territories have a second official language in addition to Russian: Buryat (in two of the merged territories), Komi-Permian, Koryak. This is an exception: all the other official languages of Russia (other than Russian) are set by the Constitutions of its constituent Republics (Mordovia, Chechnya, Dagestan etc.). The status of the &quot;administrative-territorial regions with special status&quot; has been a subject of criticism because it does not appear in the Constitution of the Russian Federation.

In addition to those six territories that entirely ceased to be subjects of the Russian Federation and were downgraded to territories with special status, another three subjects have a status of subject but are simultaneously part of a more populated subject:
*Nenets Autonomous Okrug (2010 population of 42090) has been a subject since 1993, but is also, according to its Constitution, part of Arkhangelsk Oblast
*Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug obtained autonomy in 1977, but is also part of Tyumen Oblast
*Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug obtained the status of subject in 1992 (after obtaining autonomy in 1977), but is also part of Tyumen Oblast.
With an estimated population of 49348 as of 2018, Chukotka is currently the least populated subject of Russia that is not part of a more populated subject. It was separated from Magadan Oblast in 1993. Chukotka is one of the richest subjects of Russia (with a Gross Regional Product [GRP] per capita equivalent to that of Australia) and therefore does not fit in the pattern of merging a subject to benefit from the economic dynamism of the neighbour.

In 1992, Ingushetia separated from Chechnya, both to stay away from the growing violence in Chechnya and as a bid to obtain the Eastern part of Northern Ossetia (it did not work: the Chechen conflict spread violence to Ingushetia, and North Ossetia retained its Prigorodny District). Those two Muslim republics, populated in vast majority (95%+) by closely related Vainakh people, speaking Vainakhish languages, remain the two poorest subjects of Russia, with the GRP per capita of Ingushetia being equivalent to that of Iraq. According to 2016 statistics, however, they are also the safest regions of Russia, and also have the lowest alcohol consumption, with alcohol poisoning at least 40 times lower than the federal average.

Until 1994, Sokolsky District, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast was part of Ivanovo Oblast.

In 2011–2012, the territory of Moscow increased by 140% (to ) by acquiring part of Moscow Oblast.

On 13 May 2020, the governors of Arkhangelsk Oblast and Nenets Autonomous Okrug announced their plan to merge following the collapse of oil prices stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The process was scrapped on 2 July due to its unpopularity among the population.

<text>John Troyer (3 February 1753 – 28 February 1842) was a farmer, businessman, medical practitioner, and exorcist in the Norfolk County, Ontario region.

Troyer and family emigrated from southeastern Pennsylvania in 1789 and settled in Ontario, Canada, near Long Point on Lake Erie on a farm. The farm is still known as Troyer&#x27;s Flats. This Amish family appears to have been successful in their economic pursuits with a gristmill and boat construction in addition to the farm. He became well known for his medical abilities although he had no formal training. He was locally famous for his herbal remedies.

Local legends abounded concerning witches and other paranormal activities where Dr Troyer was involved. He was known to have had exaggerated fears of witches. Examples of his witch traps (modified bear traps) can be seen in the Eva Brook Donnelly Museum in Norfolk County, Ontario. One story focused on his attempts to find a stash of gold, dumped in the area the previous century by a fur trader named David Ramsay. Another, recorded in the book &quot;Tales of Long Point&quot;, tells of Troyer following several witches to where they kept their broomsticks, then stealing one of the broomsticks for himself, and flying through the air to view a meeting of witches held at a distant location.

<doc id="701440" wikidata="Q547839" url="?curid=701440" title="Yaroslav of Tver">
<text>Yaroslav III Yaroslavich (; 1230–1271) was the first Prince of Tver from 1247, and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1263 until his death in 1271. All the later princes of Tver descended from him.

Yaroslav and his son Mikhail presided over Tver&#x27;s transformation into one of the greatest centres of power in medieval Russia which would compete with Moscow.

==Life==
Yaroslav was a son of Yaroslav II and a younger brother of Alexander Nevsky. In 1247, he received from his uncle the town of Tver.

In 1252, Yaroslav and his brother Andrey seized Alexander&#x27;s capital, Pereslavl-Zalessky. Reinforced by Tatar units, Alexander presently fought it back, taking prisoner Yaroslav&#x27;s children and leaving his wife as a casualty on the field of battle.

Yaroslav fled to Ladoga, and in 1255, he became the prince of Novgorod after Alexander&#x27;s son Vasily was expelled; Alexander returned to the city to dismiss the &quot;posadnik&quot; and by the next year, Vasily was sent back to reign. In 1258, he visited the khan&#x27;s capital in Sarai, and two years later led the Novgorod army against the Teutonic Knights.

Upon Alexander&#x27;s death in 1263, Yaroslav quarrelled with Andrey as to who should become Grand Prince next. They went to the Golden Horde for arbitration, which was in favour of Yaroslav. The latter, however, settled in Novgorod and married a daughter of one local boyar. Various Novgorodian factions still conspired against him and sought to place his brother Vasily of Kostroma or Alexander&#x27;s son Dmitri of Pereslavl on the throne.

In 1270, the armies of three princes stood for a week near the town of Staraya Russa, ready for battle. The metropolitan, however, managed to reconcile them. Yaroslav, on surrendering Novgorod to his nephew, accompanied him to Sarai. He died on his way back to Tver on 9 September 1271 and was succeeded in Tver by his eldest son Svyatoslav and then by Mikhail.

<doc id="701446" wikidata="Q4741859" url="?curid=701446" title="Disappearance of Ambrose Small">
<text>Ambrose Joseph Small (January 11, 1866 – disappeared December 2, 1919) was a Canadian theatre magnate who owned several Ontario-based theatres including the Grand Opera House in Toronto, the Grand Opera House in Kingston, the Grand Theatre in London, and the Grand Theatre in Sudbury. The last known sighting of Small occurred the evening of December 2, 1919. He had been known to travel without notice, so his disappearance was not reported until early 1920. His body was never recovered.

Small&#x27;s disappearance became a national news sensation. Various theories explaining Small&#x27;s disappearance were publicly promoted, and the famed mystery writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was consulted, although he elected not to pursue the case.

== Early life ==
Peter Ambrose Joseph Small was born on January 11, 1866, in Newmarket, Ontario, to Daniel Small, an innkeeper, and Helen (Ellen) Brazell, each twenty years old. He was baptized Roman Catholic on January 21, 1866. The Smalls were likely linked to the Brazill House (Hotel), which was established by Mary Brazell in Bond Head, Ontario.

The 1871 Canadian census places his address in Albion, Cardwell, Ontario, age 6. The 1881 Canadian census places his address in St. Andrew&#x27;s Ward, Toronto, at age 15. The 1891 Canadian census places his address in St. Thomas&#x27;s Ward, Toronto, age 25.

Small married Theresa Kormann on November 6, 1902, in Toronto.

==Disappearance==

On December 1, 1919, Ambrose Small sold all his theatre holdings at a profit of . The following day he met with lawyer F. W. M. Flock in Small&#x27;s office at the Grand Opera House. Flock left at 5:30 p.m. and was the last person to see Small.

That night, Small disappeared from his office. No one who testified for the police claimed to have seen him leave his office or in the Adelaide and Yonge Street area outside the building. A newsstand operator, Ralph Savein, claimed to have seen Small and had an altercation with him regarding the late shipment of that day&#x27;s newspapers. At the time, however, this claim was discounted by the police, who considered it to be an attempt by Savein to gain fame from the case.

Small had no motive to disappear: the millionaire did not take money with him, nor was there any ransom note, let alone evidence of kidnapping. At 53, Small owned theatres in seven Ontario cities and was the controller of 62 other buildings, a self-made millionaire at the height of his career. Because Ambrose Small was known to disappear occasionally to womanize and carouse, his absence was not reported nor was it noted for several weeks. In January 1920, Small&#x27;s attorney, F. W. M. Flock, along with Theresa Small, now alarmed by Small&#x27;s lengthy absence, notified the local police. Theresa Small offered a $50,000 reward for information about her husband&#x27;s disappearance and whereabouts if he was found alive, and $15,000 if dead. The reward went unclaimed.

==The investigation==

===Original leads===
The police launched an extensive investigation. Small was officially declared dead in 1923. The case remained unsolved until being closed in 1960.

The week of his disappearance, Small&#x27;s Opera House was playing &quot;Revelations of a Wife&quot;, a play that attracted full houses. Police analyzed the plot and its themes but found no leads. Small had not used this play to provide cryptic hints.

His wife Theresa suggested that Small had fallen into the hands of a &quot;designing woman&quot; but police found no candidates.

Along with his office, &quot;Amby&quot;, as he was known locally, had a &quot;private, secret room&quot; with its own entrance. The room is said to have had a dual purpose: first and foremost, it was for the settling of gambling debts, and secondly, it was for Ambrose Small&#x27;s many private liaisons with actresses and chorus girls, employees at his Ontario theatres. The room was scoured for leads but with no success.

Ambrose Small was not the only notable disappearance in December 1919. His former secretary, John (Jack) Doughty, had not been seen since December 2, 1919. The last sighting of Doughty in Canada was at a bank where he was observed cashing in $100,000 in bonds. He was eventually located in the United States and extradited back to Canada to stand trial. He was convicted only of the theft of the bonds. No evidence was ever found he was responsible or had any knowledge of the disappearance of his boss, Ambrose Small.
=== The 1921 Des Moines mystery man ===
Reported in several newspapers in 1921, a man was purportedly discovered in Iowa bearing resemblance to the missing man. Private detective John J. Brothy stated that the man, who he claimed was Small, was a &quot;half-crazed cripple.&quot; He stated that he had been dropped off in Des Moines, Iowa, by an unidentified motorist who claimed he&#x27;d accidentally struck Small with his car, badly wounding him and that he hoped he&#x27;d receive the best medical care available.

Brothy claimed that the man had a gunshot wound in his neck, a serious concussion and both his legs had been severed from the knee down. He further stated that the man didn&#x27;t speak for three weeks before finally breaking his silence, stating, &quot;I am John Doughty. I came here from Omaha. That is all I remember.&quot; At this time however John &quot;Jack&quot; Doughty was incarcerated in Canada and had been for several months, meaning the crippled man could not have been him.

Brothy further claimed that he showed a photo of Ambrose Small to the man to which he responded by pointing at the photo and stating, quote &quot;Yes, that is me.&quot; Brothy stated the man&#x27;s facial characteristics were identical to the missing magnate&#x27;s, however the mystery man weighed a significant amount more than Small had at his disappearance, having weighed only around 100 pounds.

Further reports state that the man was taken into custody by the P.I.(s), however the Des Moines police were quoted as being unaware of any of these actions and had not been contacted by the investigator(s).

It can be assumed that this lead turned out to be a dead end, as the case continued on long after this event.

=== 1936 Ontario Provincial Police re-investigation ===
In 1936 the case was re-investigated by the Ontario Provincial Police at the behest of the Attorney General. O.P.P. inspector Edward L. Hammond consulted with the original investigators from the Toronto police, obtained typed copies of their report and various other source documents, and re-interviewed some witnesses.

Hammond&#x27;s conclusion, that Small was murdered in a plot of which his wife was the &quot;prime mover,&quot; is in marked contrast to the Ontario government&#x27;s public position that Mrs. Small (and hence also her large monetary bequest to the Catholic church) was beyond reproach. Hammond also strongly implies that the original chief investigator, Austin Mitchell of the Toronto Police, ignored or repressed evidence which would lead to Mrs. Small as a suspect.

=== The Reuter confession letter ===
Theresa Small died October 14, 1935, bequeathing the majority of her holdings to the Roman Catholic Church, valued at over 500,000 pounds. In June 1936, her remaining possessions were to be auctioned off. Ambrose Small&#x27;s sister, Florence Small, presented a letter of confession from someone known only as &quot;Reuter,&quot; who claimed to have been the murderer.

&quot;Poor Ambrose was killed on December 2, 1919, and I know that part of his body, the trunk, was buried in the Rosedale ravine dump and other parts of the body were burned in the Grand Opera House furnace. You will be surprised, my dear Florence and Gertrude, to learn that I am more responsible for your brother&#x27;s death. God forgive me. — Reuter.&quot;

The sale, however, continued, and the letter was published in several news publications worldwide, including the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Portsmouth [UK] Evening News&quot;.

===Sir Arthur Conan Doyle===
Toronto reporters contacted Sir Arthur Conan Doyle about the case when the author was on a New York visit. Doyle politely ignored the case, but it produced the headline &quot;Sherlock Holmes takes Small case under wing&quot;.

===Charles Fort===
American writer and researcher into anomalous phenomena Charles Fort wrote about the unexplained disappearances of Ambrose Small and Ambrose Bierce, and asked &quot;Was somebody collecting Ambroses?&quot;

==In popular culture==
Small appears as a major character in the Michael Ondaatje novel &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot;. The events concerning him in the novel after his disappearance are fictitious.

Small appears as a real-life disappearance case in &quot;The Convict Lover&quot; by Canadian author Merilyn Simonds.

In 2019 a book by &quot;Toronto Star&quot; feature writer Katie Daubs, marking the 100th anniversary of Small&#x27;s disappearance, was widely anticipated.

In 2019, the Grand Theatre in London, Ontario commissioned a play about the disappearance from Trina Davies. &quot;Grand Ghosts&quot;, a theatrical, vaudeville-influenced play, made its debut in October 2022.

<text>Charles Lamont &quot;Charlie&quot; Jenkins (born January 7, 1934) is a former American athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics.

Coached by Jumbo Elliott, Jenkins won in the 1955 National AAU title in 440 yd (402 m) but at the 1956 Olympics all eyes were on Jenkins&#x27; U.S. teammate, Lou Jones, who held the world record. Jones had won the U.S. Trials while Jenkins had placed a distant third. At Melbourne, Jenkins barely made it to the 400 m Olympic final, finishing third in both his first and second-round heats. In the final, however, a strong finish earned him the gold medal. A few days later he won a second gold medal when the U.S. took the 4 x 400 m relay.

Jenkins also competed indoors, winning the AAU 600 yd (549 m) title in 1955, 1957 and 1958. In 1956, he set a world indoor best for 500 yd (457 m). When Elliott died in 1981, Jenkins succeeded him as Villanova coach. One of his charges was his son, Chip, who placed third at the 1986 NCAA indoor championships. Like his father, Chip also became an Olympic gold medalist, running as a reserve on the U.S. 4×400 m relay team at the 1992 Summer Olympics making it the first time in history that a father and a son won gold medals in the same event.

In December 1956 Jenkins married Phyllis Randolph. In the 1970s he worked for the U.S. Office of Education.

<doc id="701462" wikidata="Q556977" url="?curid=701462" title="Cutoff (physics)">
<text>In theoretical physics, cutoff (AE: cutoff, BE: cut-off) is an arbitrary maximal or minimal value of energy, momentum, or length, used in order that objects with larger or smaller values than these physical quantities are ignored in some calculation. It is usually represented within a particular energy or length scale, such as Planck units.

When used in this context, the traditional terms &quot;infrared&quot; and &quot;ultraviolet&quot; are not literal references to specific regions of the spectrum, but rather refer by analogy to portions of a calculation for low energies (infrared) and high energies (ultraviolet), respectively.

==Infrared and ultraviolet cutoff==
An infrared cutoff (long-distance cutoff) is the minimal value of energy – or, equivalently, the maximal wavelength (usually a very large distance) – that will be taken into account in a calculation, typically an integral.

At the opposite end of the energy scale, an ultraviolet cutoff is the maximal allowed energy or the shortest allowed distance (usually a very short length scale).

==Effect on calculation==
A typical use of cutoffs is to prevent singularities from appearing during calculation. If some quantities are computed as integrals over energy or another physical quantity, these cutoffs determine the limits of integration. The exact physics is reproduced when the appropriate cutoffs are sent to zero or infinity. However, these integrals are often divergent – see IR divergence and UV divergence – and a cutoff is needed. The dependence of physical quantities on the chosen cutoffs (especially the ultraviolet cutoffs) is the main focus of the theory of the renormalization group.

<doc id="701471" wikidata="Q3519831" url="?curid=701471" title="Men's rugby league Ashes (original series)">
<text>The Ashes series, similar to the cricket series of the same name, was a best-of-three series of test matches between Australia and Great Britain national rugby league football teams. It had been contested 39 times from 1908 until 2003 largely with hosting rights alternating between the two countries. Since 1973, Australia has won a record thirteen consecutive Ashes series.

In 2023, the modern Ashes series was founded with the inaugural edition to take place in 2025, which would also include a women&#x27;s series. The series will continue as a best-of-three test match series between Australia and this time England national rugby league football teams.

This came after two failed revivals, one in 2020 which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and another in 2022 (set for 2024) as part of a potential Australian tour of Great Britain.

==History==
Several sports and events adopted cricket&#x27;s Ashes concept and by the beginning of the 20th century it was an &quot;accepted principle&quot; that a series had to have at least three matches to be a true test of which side was the best.

On 27 September 1908, the first touring Australian rugby league side arrived in England, and played their first ever Test against the England side in December in London. Two further Tests were played. The Australians suggested that the series should be called &quot;The Ashes&quot; and the name stuck.

The format used is that three matches are played, with the winning team being decided on the basis of most matches won. If one team has already won two matches the series is already won, however the final game is usually still played. In the 1929–30 Ashes series both the teams won one game and one game was drawn; it was therefore decided to hold a further match to determine the outcome.

The British side has not always been termed Great Britain; in the past the titles &quot;Northern Union XIII&quot;, &quot;England&quot; and &quot;The Lions&quot; have also been used. Similarly, the first two tours to Britain (1911–12 and 1921–22), included New Zealand players so were styled &quot;Australasia&quot;, though when playing at home they always played as Australia.

Since 1964 the Harry Sunderland Medal is awarded to the best Australian player in a home Ashes series. Since Great Britain&#x27;s win in Australia in 1970, the series has been very one sided with Australia having won 13 consecutive ashes, 5 of those (1979, 1982, 1984, 1986 and 2003) being 3–0 series whitewashes while the 1988 series had already been won by Australia in the first two tests before the Lions won a famous third test in Sydney 26–12 for their first test win over Australia since the second test of the 1978 Kangaroo tour, a streak of 15 wins for the Kangaroos.

The performance gap between the two teams became wider during the mid-late 1970s and Great Britain struggled to compete with Australia. The 1982 Kangaroos became the first side to go through a tour of Great Britain and France undefeated (something never achieved on a Lions tour, though they came close in 1954 losing just 2 games). This earned the team the nickname &quot;The Invincibles&quot;. The 1986 Kangaroos repeated this feat and would be known as &quot;The Unbeatables&quot;.

The final Ashes series was contested in 2003. The event is scheduled to return in 2025 - with talks taking place over the series being staged in England, having initially been set to be in Australia. 

==Trophy==
In 1928, the City Tattersalls Club in Sydney, Australia donated a trophy to be the prize, the &quot;Ashes Cup&quot;. 
The Cup&#x27;s inscription reads:

INTERNATIONAL
RUGBY LEAGUE FOOTBALL
Australia v England
(THE ASHES)
Presented by
CITY TATTERSALLS CLUB
The Cup was first presented in 1928 to &quot;The Lions&quot;, after they defeated Australia 2–1 in the series. Following the 1933–34 series, in which England retained the Cup for the third time since first being presented with it, the Cup disappeared in the United Kingdom and was not found until October 1945. The trophy had been on display at a function in Ilkley, Yorkshire and afterwards was returned to the manager of the Griffin Hotel, Leeds - where the English Rugby League management met - but this was not made clear to the English authorities and instead in laid overlooked in a box for 12 years. During the period it was missing, Great Britain had won each series and the Cup&#x27;s disappearance was not widely known. The Australian team first won the Cup in 1950.

In preparation for the &quot;Legends of League&quot; exhibition at the National Museum of Australia in 2008, marking a Centenary of Rugby League in Australia, the Ashes Cup underwent preservation work.

<text>In physics, an infrared divergence (also IR divergence or infrared catastrophe) is a situation in which an integral, for example a Feynman diagram, diverges because of contributions of objects with very small energy approaching zero, or equivalently, because of physical phenomena at very long distances.

==Overview==
The infrared divergence only appears in theories with massless particles (such as photons). They represent a legitimate effect that a complete theory often implies. In fact, in the case of photons, the energy is given by formula_1, where formula_2 is the frequency associated to the particle and as it goes to zero, like in the case of soft photons, there will be an infinite number of particles in order to have a finite amount of energy. One way to deal with it is to impose an infrared cutoff and take the limit as the cutoff approaches zero and/or refine the question. Another way is to assign the massless particle a fictitious mass, and then take the limit as the fictitious mass vanishes.

The divergence is usually in terms of particle number and not empirically troubling, in that all measurable quantities remain finite. (Unlike in the case of the UV catastrophe where the energies involved diverge.)

==Bremsstrahlung example==
When an electric charge is accelerated (or decelerated) it emits Bremsstrahlung radiation. Semiclassical electromagnetic theory, or the full quantum electrodynamic analysis, shows that an infinite number of soft photons are created. But only a finite number are detectable, the remainder, due to their low energy, falling below any finite energy detection threshold, which must necessarily exist. However even though most of the photons are not detectable they can&#x27;t be ignored in the theory; quantum electrodynamic calculations show that the transition amplitude between &quot;any&quot; states with a finite number of photons vanishes. Finite transition amplitudes are obtained only by summing over states with an infinite number of soft photons.

The zero-energy photons become important in analyzing the Bremsstrahlung radiation in the coaccelerated frame in which the charge experiences a thermal bath due to the Unruh effect. In this case, the static charge will only interact with these zero-energy (Rindler) photons in a sense similar to virtual photons in the coulomb interaction.

<doc id="701494" wikidata="Q1366745" url="?curid=701494" title="HX convoys">
<text>HX convoys were transatlantic convoys in the North Atlantic during the First World War and in the Battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War. HX convoys sailed eastwards from Halifax, Nova Scotia in Canada, to Liverpool and other ports in Britain. They rendezvoused with BHX convoys from Bermuda &quot;en route&quot;. After the United States entered the war, HX convoys began at New York.

The HX series consisted of 377 convoys, with 17,744 ships. Thirty-eight convoys were attacked (about 10 per cent), with the loss of 110 ships in convoy; sixty stragglers were sunk and 36 lost while detached or after dispersal, with losses from marine accident and other causes, for a total loss of 206 ships or about 1 per cent of the total.

==Background==

An HX series had run in the Atlantic Campaign of the First World War in 1917 and 1918. HX convoys were revived in 1939 at the beginning of the Battle of the Atlantic and were run until the end, the longest continuous series of the war. HX 1 sailed on 16 September 1939 with 18 merchant ships, escorted by the Royal Canadian Navy destroyers and to a North Atlantic rendezvous with Royal Navy heavy cruisers and . HX 358 sailed on 23 May 1945 and arrived at Liverpool on 6 June 1945. HX convoys were initially considered fast and made up of ships that could make , the voyage from New York to Liverpool taking an average of 15.2 days. A parallel series of slow convoys (SC), was run for ships making , which took about 15.4 days from Sydney, Nova Scotia.

Ships making more than sailed independently; CU (Caribbean to United Kingdom) series were organised in 1943, most being US war-built tankers of +, which later included troop transports and fast merchant ships. Outbound convoys were usually slower than return convoys and summer voyages usually faster than those in winter. Delays for diversions and bad weather could lead to escort vessels at the ocean rendezvous running low on fuel and having to return. A convoy that went way off course or encountered unusually stormy or foggy weather would be lucky to make rendezvous with its escorts. The largest convoy of the Second World War was Convoy HX 300 which sailed from New York to Britain on 25 July 1944, with 166 merchant ships, arriving at Liverpool without incident, on 3 August 1944.

==Convoy battles==

* Convoy HX 79 Attacked by a U-boat Wolfpack in October 1940. Twelve ships were lost, which, with the attack on Convoy SC 7 on the same day, made 19 October and the night of 19/20 October 1940 the worst period for shipping losses of the Battle of the Atlantic.
* Convoy HX 84 Attacked on 5 November 1940 by the . Five ships were quickly sunk but the sacrifice of an armed merchant cruiser and the armed merchant ship SS &quot;Beaverford&quot; along with failing light, allowed the rest of the convoy to escape. The oil tanker was part of the convoy.
* Convoy HX 106 On 8 February 1941 two German battlecruisers, and appeared over the horizon. The presence of the escorting battleship deterred an attack.
* Convoy HX 112 Attacked in March 1941, this battle was notable for seeing the loss to the (German navy) of two of its U-boat aces, Otto Kretschmer and Joachim Schepke.
* Convoy HX 156 was being escorted by the United States Navy in October, 1941, when torpedoed , the first US warship sunk in the Second World War.
* Convoy HX 212 suffered the worst loss of an HX convoy in 1942.
* Convoy HX 228 Was one of several convoys attacked during March 1943. Two U-boats were destroyed while sinking four merchant ships and the escort commander&#x27;s destroyer.
* Convoys HX 229/SC 122. Attacked in March 1943, this action converged with the operation around Convoy SC 122 and became the largest convoy battle of the Atlantic campaign.

<doc id="701496" wikidata="Q3032228" url="?curid=701496" title="Ultraviolet divergence">
<text>In physics, an ultraviolet divergence or UV divergence is a situation in which an integral, for example a Feynman diagram, diverges because of contributions of objects with unbounded energy, or, equivalently, because of physical phenomena at infinitesimal distances.

==Overview==
Since an infinite result is unphysical, ultraviolet divergences often require special treatment to remove unphysical effects inherent in the perturbative formalisms. In particular, UV divergences can often be removed by regularization and renormalization. Successful resolution of an ultraviolet divergence is known as ultraviolet completion. If they cannot be removed, they imply that the theory is not perturbatively well-defined at very short distances.

The name comes from the earliest example of such a divergence, the &quot;ultraviolet catastrophe&quot; first encountered in understanding blackbody radiation. According to classical physics at the end of the nineteenth century, the quantity of radiation in the form of light released at any specific wavelength should increase with decreasing wavelength—in particular, there should be considerably more ultraviolet light released from a blackbody radiator than infrared light. Measurements showed the opposite, with maximal energy released at intermediate wavelengths, suggesting a failure of classical mechanics. This problem eventually led to the development of quantum mechanics.

The successful resolution of the original ultraviolet catastrophe has prompted the pursuit of solutions to other problems of ultraviolet divergence. A similar problem in electromagnetism was solved by Richard Feynman by applying quantum field theory through the use of renormalization groups, leading to the successful creation of quantum electrodynamics (QED). Similar techniques led to the standard model of particle physics. Ultraviolet divergences remain a key feature in the exploration of new physical theories, like supersymmetry.

== Proliferation in perturbative theory ==

Commenting on the fact that contemporary theories about quantum scattering of fundamental particles grew out of application of the quantization procedure to classical fields that satisfy wave equations, J.D. Bjorken and Sidney Drell pointed out the following facts about such a procedure which are still as relevant today as in 1965:
The first is that we are led to a theory with differential wave propagation. The field functions are continuous functions of continuous parameters and , and the changes in the fields at a point are determined by properties of the fields infinitesimally close to the point . For most wave fields (for example, sound waves and the vibrations of strings and membranes) such a description is an idealization which is valid for distances larger than the characteristic length which measures the granularity of the medium. For smaller distances these theories are modified in a profound way. The electromagnetic field is a notable exception. Indeed, until the special theory of relativity obviated the necessity of a mechanistic interpretation, physicists made great efforts to discover evidence for such a mechanical description of the radiation field. After the requirement of an “ether” which propagates light waves had been abandoned, there was considerably less difficulty in accepting this same idea when the observed wave properties of the electron suggested the introduction of a new field. Indeed there is no evidence of an ether which underlies the electron wave. However, it is a gross and profound extrapolation of present experimental knowledge to assume that a wave description successful at “large” distances (that is, atomic lengths ≈&quot;10 −8&quot; cm) may be extended to distances an indefinite number of orders of magnitude smaller (for example, to less than nuclear lengths ≈&quot;10 −13&quot; cm). In the relativistic theory, we have seen that the assumption that the field description is correct in arbitrarily small space-time intervals has led—in perturbation theory—to divergent expressions for the electron self-energy and the bare charge. Renormalization theory has sidestepped these divergence difficulties, which may be indicative of the failure of the perturbation expansion. However, it is widely felt that the divergences are symptomatic of a chronic disorder in the small-distance behaviour of the theory. We might then ask why local field theories, that is, theories of fields which can be described by differential laws of wave propagation, have been so extensively used and accepted. There are several reasons, including the important one that with their aid a significant region of agreement with observations has been found. But the foremost reason is brutally simple: there exists no convincing form of a theory which avoids differential field equations.

<doc id="701509" wikidata="Q1316152" url="?curid=701509" title="Charged black hole">
<text>A charged black hole is a black hole that possesses electric charge. Since the electromagnetic repulsion in compressing an electrically charged mass is dramatically greater than the gravitational attraction (by about 40 orders of magnitude), it is not expected that black holes with a significant electric charge will be formed in nature.

==Categories==
The two types of charged black holes are Reissner–Nordström black holes (without spin), and Kerr–Newman black holes (with spin).

A black hole can be completely characterized by three (and only three) quantities:
* &quot;M&quot; – mass
* &quot;J&quot; – angular momentum
* &quot;Q&quot; – electric charge

Charged black holes are two of four possible types of black holes that have been found by solving Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravitation, general relativity. The mathematical solutions for the shape of space and the electric and magnetic fields near a black hole are named after the persons who first worked them out. The solutions increase in complexity depending on which of the two parameters, &quot;J&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, are zero (or not) (the mass &quot;M&quot; of a black hole could conceivably be tiny, but not zero). The four categories of solutions are given in the table below:
The solutions of Einstein&#x27;s field equation for the gravitational field of an electrically charged point mass (with zero angular momentum), in empty space was obtained in 1918 by Hans Reissner and Gunnar Nordström, not long after Karl Schwarzschild found the Schwarzschild metric as a solution for a point mass without electric charge and angular momentum.

A mathematically oriented article describes that the Reissner–Nordström metric for a charged, non-rotating black hole. A similarly technical article on the Kerr–Newman black hole gives an overview of the most general known solution for a black hole, which has both angular momentum and charge (all the other solutions are simplified special cases of the Kerr–Newman black hole).

<text> is the German word for a long barreled firearm, such as a rifle or shotgun. Prior to the 1840s, rifled guns were not widespread, usually muzzle-loading and termed , as they are still in German hunting jargon today. Etymologically is related to &quot;fighting&quot;, and so became the standard term for military-type weapons.

The term &quot;Gewehr&quot; can be encountered in the context of 19th and 20th century military history for nonspecific rifles from German-speaking countries, e.g. in arms trade, in particular for types produced before German unification in 1871.

Specific types, sorted chronologically from 1841 to 1997 and with designer given, are:

* Gewehr 41 (Dreyse, 1841)
* Gewehr 71 (Mauser, 1871)
* Gewehr 88 (state committee, 1888)
* Gewehr 98 (Mauser, 1898)
* T-Gewehr (Mauser, 1918)
* Gewehr 41 (Walther, 1941)
* Gewehr 43 (Walther, 1943)
* Sturmgewehr 44 (CITEFA/Schmeisser, 1944)

<text>Gordon Bell (1934 – 13 February 2014) was a British cartoonist, best known for humorous strips for D. C. Thomson&#x27;s weekly comics, including &quot;Pup Parade&quot; in &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;Spoofer McGraw&quot; in &quot;Sparky&quot;.

==Biography==
Bell grew up in Dundee, Scotland, where he was educated at Clepington Primary School and Morgan Academy, and studied art at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design. He and author Brian Callison ran CB Studios, an art and furniture business, for a time.

From the late 1950s he worked as a cartoonist, mainly for D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, publishers of &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot; among others. He contributed to most of the company&#x27;s comics. His longest running strip was &quot;Pup Parade&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Bash Street Kids&quot; featuring the kids&#x27; dogs, which he drew regularly in &quot;The Beano&quot; from 1967 to 1988, in &quot;The Topper&quot; from 1989 to 1990, and &quot;The Beezer&quot; from 1990 to 1992. According to D. C. Thomson editor Iain McLaughlin, he was &quot;professional, quick, and ready to try anything.&quot; He did some work for IPC&#x27;s comics, drawing &quot;The Wolf Pack&quot; in &quot;Whoopee!&quot; in 1974, and for the motoring magazine &quot;Autocar&quot;, and created the &quot;9 Wellies&quot;, cartoon characters designed to cheer up children in hospital for NHS Tayside. His satirical cartoons headed the political diary every Saturday in &quot;The Courier&quot;, signed &quot;Fax&quot;.

His main interest outside work was motor sports. He was a member of 750 Motor Club, and an RAC steward at Knockhill Racing Circuit. He and his wife Isabel, with whom he had two sons and two stepsons, lived in the West End of Dundee. He died suddenly on 13 February 2014, at the age of 79.

<text>David Wulstan Myatt (born 1950), also known by the pseudonym Abdulaziz ibn Myatt al-Qari, is a British author, religious leader, far-right and former Islamist militant, most notable for allegedly being the political and religious leader of the White nationalist theistic Satanist organization Order of Nine Angles (ONA) from 1974 onwards. He is also the founder of Numinous Way. He is a former Muslim.

==Early life==

David Wulstan Myatt grew up in Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania), where his father worked as a civil servant for the British government, and later in the Far East, where he studied martial arts. He moved to England in 1967 to complete his schooling. He is reported to live in the Midlands. 

According to Jeffrey Kaplan, Myatt has undertaken &quot;a global odyssey which took him on extended stays in the Middle East and East Asia, accompanied by studies of religions ranging from Christianity to Islam in the Western tradition and Taoism and Buddhism in the Eastern path. In the course of this Siddhartha-like search for truth, Myatt sampled the life of the monastery in both its Christian and Buddhist forms.&quot;

==Beliefs and career==
Political scientist George Michael writes that Myatt has &quot;arguably done more than any other theorist to develop a synthesis of the extreme right and Islam,&quot; and is &quot;arguably England&#x27;s principal proponent of contemporary neo-Nazi ideology and theoretician of revolution.&quot;

He described Myatt as an &quot;intriguing theorist&quot; whose &quot;Faustian quests&quot; not only involved studying Taoism and spending time in a Buddhist and later a Christian monastery, but also allegedly involved exploring the occult, and Paganism and what Michael calls &quot;quasi-Satanic&quot; secret societies, while remaining a committed National Socialist.

In 2000, British anti-fascist magazine &quot;Searchlight&quot; wrote that: &quot;[Myatt] does not have the appearance of a Nazi ideologue ... [S]porting a long ginger beard, Barbour jacket, cords and a tweed flat cap, he resembles an eccentric country gentleman out for a Sunday ramble. But Myatt is anything but the country squire, for beneath this seemingly innocuous exterior is a man of extreme and calculated hatred. Over the past ten years, Myatt has emerged as the most ideologically driven nazi in Britain, preaching race war and terrorism [...] Myatt is believed to have been behind a 15-page document which called for race war, under the imprint White Wolves.&quot;

At a 2003 UNESCO conference in Paris, which concerned the growth of antisemitism, it was stated that &quot;David Myatt, the leading hardline Nazi intellectual in Britain since the 1960s [...] has converted to Islam, praises bin Laden and al Qaeda, calls the 9/11 attacks &#x27;acts of heroism,&#x27; and urges the killing of Jews. Myatt, under the name Abdul Aziz Ibn Myatt supports suicide missions and urges young Muslims to take up Jihad. Observers warn that Myatt is a dangerous man...&quot; This view of Myatt as a radical Muslim, or Jihadi, is supported by Professor Robert S. Wistrich, who writes that Myatt, when a Muslim, was a staunch advocate of &quot;Jihad, suicide missions and killing Jews...&quot; and also &quot;an ardent defender of bin Laden&quot;. One of Myatt&#x27;s writings justifying suicide attacks was, for several years, on the &quot;Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades&quot; (the military wing) section of the Hamas website.

In addition to writing about Islam and National Socialism, Myatt has translated works by Sophocles, Sappho, Aeschylus, and Homer. He has also developed a mystical philosophy which he calls &quot;The Numinous Way&quot; and invented a three-dimensional board-game, the Star Game.

===Alleged involvement with occultism===

Myatt is alleged to have been the founder of the occult group the Order of Nine Angles (ONA/O9A) or to have taken it over, written the publicly available teachings of the ONA under the pseudonym Anton Long, with his role being &quot;paramount to the whole creation and existence of the ONA&quot;. According to scholar Jacob C. Senholt, &quot;ONA-inspired activities, led by protagonist David Myatt, managed to enter the scene of grand politics and the global &#x27;War On Terror&#x27;, because of several foiled terror plots in Europe that can be linked to Myatt&#x27;s writings&quot;.

David Myatt has always denied such allegations about involvement with the ONA.

George Sieg expressed doubts regarding Myatt being Long, writing that he considered it to be &quot;implausible and untenable based on the extent of variance in writing style, personality, and tone&quot; between Myatt and Long&#x27;s writings. Jeffrey Kaplan also suggested that Myatt and Long are separate people, as did the religious studies scholar Connell R. Monette who wrote that it was quite possible that &#x27;Anton Long&#x27; was a pseudonym used by multiple individuals over the last 30 years.

====Order of Nine Angles====
The Order of Nine Angles (ONA) originally was a Wiccan organization founded during the 1960s, and became a theistic Satanist organization once the leadership was allegedly taken over in 1974 by David Myatt, previously known under the pseudonym of Anton Long, a former bodyguard and supporter of the British Neo-Nazi leader Colin Jordan. In 1998, Myatt converted to radical Islam while continuing to lead the Order of Nine Angles; later on, he repudiated the Islamic religion in 2010 and publicly declared to have renounced all forms of extremism. The Order of Nine Angles identify as theistic Satanists and affirm to practice &quot;traditional Satanism&quot;. However, the doctrine of the Order of Nine Angles is complex and multifaceted. Sociologist of religion Massimo Introvigne defined it as &quot;a synthesis of three different currents: hermetic, pagan, and Satanist&quot;, whereas the medievalist and professor of Religious studies Connell Monette dismissed the Satanic features of the ONA as &quot;cosmetic&quot; and contended that &quot;its core mythos and cosmology are genuinely &quot;hermetic&quot;&quot;. According to the scholar of Western esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, &quot;the ONA celebrated the dark, destructive side of life through anti-Christian, elitist, and Social Darwinist doctrines&quot;, together with the organization&#x27;s implicit ties to Neo-Nazism and the appraisal of National Socialism. The Order of Nine Angles believe that the seven planets and their satellites are connected to the &quot;Dark Gods&quot;, while Satan is considered to be one of two &quot;actual entities&quot;, the other one being Baphomet, with the former conceived as male and the latter as female. The organization became controversial and was mentioned in the press and books because of their promotion of human sacrifice. Since the 2010s, the political ideology and religious worldview of the Order of Nine Angles have increasingly influenced militant neo-fascist and Neo-Nazi insurgent groups associated with right-wing extremist and White supremacist international networks, most notably the Iron March forum.

Myatt is regarded as an &quot;example of the axis between right-wing extremists and Islamists&quot;, and has been described as an &quot;extremely violent, intelligent, dark, and complex individual&quot;; as a martial arts expert; as one of the more interesting figures on the British neo-Nazi scene since the 1970s, and as a key Al-Qaeda propagandist. According to Daniel Koehler of the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, Myatt &quot;is a complex persona who defies simple answers to the question of why he changed groups and milieus so often and so fundamentally. It is also obvious, that during large parts of his life, Myatt was driven by a search for meaning and purpose.&quot;

Before his conversion to Islam in 1998, Myatt was the first leader of the British National Socialist Movement (NSM), and was identified by &quot;The Observer&quot;, as the &quot;ideological heavyweight&quot; behind Combat 18.

Myatt came to public attention in 1999, a year after his Islamic conversion, when a pamphlet he allegedly wrote many years earlier, &quot;A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution&quot;, described as a &quot;detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection&quot;, was said to have inspired David Copeland, who left nailbombs in areas frequented by London&#x27;s black, South Asian, and gay communities. Three people died and 129 were injured in the explosions, several of them losing limbs. It has also been suggested that Myatt&#x27;s &quot;A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution&quot; might have influenced the German National Socialist Underground.

In 2021 The Counter Extremism Project listed Myatt as one of the world&#x27;s 20 most dangerous extremists.

==Political activism==

Myatt joined Colin Jordan&#x27;s British Movement, a neo-Nazi group, in 1968, where he sometimes acted as Jordan&#x27;s bodyguard at meetings and rallies. Myatt would later become Leeds Branch Secretary and a member of British Movement&#x27;s National Council. From the 1970s until the 1990s, he remained involved with paramilitary and neo-Nazi organisations such as Column 88 and Combat 18, and was imprisoned twice for violent offences in connection with his political activism.

Myatt was the founder and first leader of the National Socialist Movement of which David Copeland was a member. He also co-founded, with Eddy Morrison, the neo-Nazi organization the NDFM (National Democratic Freedom Movement) which was active in Leeds, England, in the early 1970s, and the neo-Nazi Reichsfolk group, which Reichsfolk organization &quot;aimed to create a new Aryan elite, The Legion of Adolf Hitler, and so prepare the way for a golden age in place of &#x27;the disgusting, decadent present with its dishonourable values and dis-honourable weak individuals&#x27;&quot;.

Of the NDFM, John Tyndall wrote (in a polemic against NDFM co-founder Eddy Morrison): &quot;The National Democratic Freedom Movement made little attempt to engage in serious politics but concentrated its activities mainly upon acts of violence against its opponents. [...] Before very long the NDFM had degenerated into nothing more than a criminal gang.&quot;

It is also alleged that in the early 1980s Myatt tried to establish a Nazi-occultist commune in Shropshire, which project was advertised in Colin Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Gothic Ripples&quot; newsletter, with Goodrick-Clark writing that &quot;after marrying and settling in Church Stretton in Shropshire, [Myatt] attempted in 1983 to set up a rural commune within the framework of Colin Jordan&#x27;s Vanguard Project for neo-nazi utopias publicized in &quot;Gothic Ripples&quot;&quot;.

Michael writes that Myatt took over the leadership of Combat 18 in 1998, when Charlie Sargent, the previous leader, was jailed for murder.

===Alleged influence on David Copeland===

In November 1997, Myatt allegedly posted a racist and anti-Semitic pamphlet he had written called &quot;Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution&quot; on a website based in British Columbia, Canada by Bernard Klatt. The pamphlet included chapter titles such as &quot;Assassination&quot;, &quot;Terror Bombing&quot;, and &quot;Racial War&quot;. According to Michael Whine of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, &quot;[t]he contents provided a detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection with advice on assassination targets, rationale for bombing and sabotage campaigns, and rules of engagement.&quot;

In February 1998, detectives from S012 Scotland Yard raided Myatt&#x27;s home in Worcestershire and removed his computers and files. He was arrested on suspicion of incitement to murder and incitement to racial hatred, but the case later dropped, after a three-year investigation, because the evidence supplied by the Canadian authorities was not enough to secure a conviction.

It was a copy of the &quot;Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution&quot; pamphlet that, in 1999, was discovered by police in the flat of David Copeland, the London nailbomber – who was also a member of Myatt&#x27;s National Socialist Movement – and thus which allegedly influenced him to plant homemade bombs targeting immigrants in Brixton, Brick Lane, and inside the Admiral Duncan pub on Old Compton Street in London, frequented by the black, Asian, and gay communities respectively. Friends John Light, Nick Moore, and Andrea Dykes and her unborn child died in the Admiral Duncan pub. Copeland told police he had been trying to spark a &quot;racial war.&quot;

Following the conviction of Copeland for murder on 30 June 2000, after a trial at the Old Bailey, one newspaper wrote of Myatt: &quot;This is the man who shaped mind of a bomber; Cycling the lanes around Malvern, the mentor who drove David Copeland to kill [...] Riding a bicycle around his Worcestershire home town sporting a wizard-like beard and quirky dress-sense, the former monk could easily pass as a country eccentric or off-beat intellectual. But behind David Myatt&#x27;s studious exterior lies a more sinister character that has been at the forefront of extreme right-wing ideology in Britain since the mid-1960s.&quot;

According to the &quot;BBC&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Panorama&quot;, in 1998 when Myatt was leader of the NSM, he called for &quot;the creation of racial terror with bombs&quot;. Myatt is also quoted by &quot;Searchlight&quot; as having stated that &quot;[t]he primary duty of all National Socialists is to change the world. National Socialism means revolution: the overthrow of the existing System and its replacement with a National-Socialist society. Revolution means struggle: it means war. It means certain tactics have to be employed, and a great revolutionary movement organised which is primarily composed of those prepared to fight, prepared to get their hands dirty and perhaps spill some blood&quot;.

==Conversion to Islam==
Myatt converted to Islam in 1998. He told Professor George Michael that his decision to convert began when he took a job on a farm in England. He was working long hours in the fields and felt an affinity with nature, concluding that the sense of harmony he felt had not come about by chance. He told Michael that he was also impressed by the militancy of Islamist groups, and believed that he shared common enemies with Islam, namely &quot;the capitalist-consumer West and international finance.&quot;

While initially some critics, specifically the anti-fascist &quot;Searchlight&quot; organization, suggested that Myatt&#x27;s conversion &quot;may be just a political ploy to advance his own failing anti-establishment agenda&quot;, it is now generally accepted that his conversion was genuine.

As a Muslim, he travelled and spoke in several Arab countries, and wrote one of the most detailed defenses in the English language of Islamic suicide attacks. He also expressed support for the Taliban, and referred to the Holocaust as a &quot;hoax&quot;. An April 2005 NATO workshop heard that Myatt had called on &quot;all enemies of the Zionists to embrace the Jihad&quot; against Jews and the United States.

According to an article in &quot;The Times&quot; published on 24 April 2006, Myatt then believed that: &quot;The pure authentic Islam of the revival, which recognises practical jihad as a duty, is the only force that is capable of fighting and destroying the dishonour, the arrogance, the materialism of the West ... For the West, nothing is sacred, except perhaps Zionists, Zionism, the hoax of the so-called Holocaust, and the idols which the West and its lackeys worship, or pretend to worship, such as democracy... Jihad is our duty. If nationalists, or some of them, desire to aid us, to help us, they can do the right thing, the honourable thing, and convert, revert, to Islam — accepting the superiority of Islam over and above each and every way of the West.&quot;

==Departure from Islam==
In 2010, Myatt publicly announced that he had rejected both Islam and extremism.

<doc id="701541" wikidata="Q1019452" url="?curid=701541" title="Stykkishólmur">
<text>Stykkishólmur () is a town and municipality situated in the western part of Iceland, in the northern part of the Snæfellsnes peninsula. It is a center of services and commerce for the area. Most of the people make their living from fishing and tourism. A ferry called &quot;Baldur&quot; goes over the Breiðafjörður fjord to the Westfjords. It also is the gateway to Flatey. The origin of Stykkishólmur can be traced to its natural harbor. The location became an important trading post early in Iceland&#x27;s history: the first trading post in Stykkishólmur is traced back to the mid-16th century, even before Denmark implemented the Danish–Icelandic Trade Monopoly (1602 – 1787). From that time trading has been at the heart of the settlement&#x27;s history. In 1828 Árni Thorlacius built a large house for his home and companies, the Norwegian house, which has been renovated and accommodates the local museum.

==Overview==
The favorable position of Stykkishólmur was discovered in 1550 when a trading post was founded at the site. Today, the most vital employment sectors in the town are fishing and tourism, especially during the summer. There are several sightworthy wooden buildings in the town centre. &quot;Egilsenshús&quot; is a wooden house dating from 1867 which belonged to a Danish merchant.

The town was named after a small island in front of the harbor called &quot;Stykkið&quot; (, &quot;the piece&quot;). The nearby mountain of Helgafell is the burial place of Guðrún Ósvífursdóttir, a heroine of the Icelandic sagas.

The town&#x27;s former library has been restored as a public hall and contains an installation by the American artist Roni Horn.

The sports club of Stykkishólmur is called Snæfell, named after the glacier Snæfellsjökull located on Snæfellsnes. The town&#x27;s most popular sport is basketball.

==In popular culture==
In the 1986 novel &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;, Stykkishólmur is the site of a landing by US Marines tasked with liberating Iceland from occupying Soviet forces.

Chess champion Bobby Fischer was planning on moving to Stykkishólmur before his sudden death in early 2008.

Stykkishólmur is the main setting in the short story &quot;Tussenlanding&quot; (&quot;Transfer&quot;) from the 1991 short story collection &quot;De Matador en andere verhalen&quot; by Tim Krabbé. The story features a Dutchman coming to Iceland in hope to start a relationship with an Icelandic woman he barely knows.

The town was the filming location for the depictions of Nuuk, Greenland in the 2013 movie &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;.

==Town festival==
Every year on the second or third weekend in August, the people in Stykkishólmur celebrate the &quot;Danskir dagar&quot; (&quot;Danish days&quot;) festival, which honors the town&#x27;s historic connections with Denmark. The festival has been held every year since 1994.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Stykkishólmur is twinned with:
* Drammen, Norway
* Kolding, Denmark
* Lappeenranta, Finland
* Örebro, Sweden

==Climate==
Stykkishólmur features a subpolar oceanic climate moderated by the nearby ocean. It has cool summers, but also winter averages less cold than cities much further south featuring temperate continental climates, such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Toronto, or Denver. April - July is the driest season, while autumn and winter is the wettest season.

<doc id="701563" wikidata="Q3108207" url="?curid=701563" title="Melvin Mora">
<text>Melvin Mora Diaz (born February 2, 1972) is a Venezuelan-American former professional baseball infielder. He played for the New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB).
From his debut in 1999 to 2003, Mora was known as a utility player, playing all three outfield positions, shortstop, and second base. In 2004, the Orioles made Mora their everyday third baseman, a position he occupied through 2009.

==Career==

===New York Mets===
Mora was signed out of Venezuela as an amateur free agent in 1991. After spending seven years in the Astros farm system and few months in the Chinese Professional Baseball League with the Mercuries Tigers, he signed as a free agent with the Mets in 1998 and made his major league debut in the 1999 season. Mora made himself more valuable by being able to play all three outfield positions, shortstop, second base and third.
In 1999, he scored the winning run of the final game of the year for the Mets on a wild pitch by the Pirates&#x27; Brad Clontz, which propelled the Mets to a one-game playoff with Cincinnati, which they won.

Mora became a cult hero in New York as he starred in the 1999 National League Championship Series, batting a clutch .429 with an OPS of 1.143, and throwing runners out at home plate and third base from his right field position.

In 2000, shortstop Rey Ordoñez broke his arm, ending Ordoñez&#x27;s season. Mora was moved to shortstop, where he struggled defensively.

===Baltimore Orioles===

====2000–03====
The Mets traded Mora to Baltimore on July 28, 2000, with two minor league players and Mike Kinkade for veteran shortstop Mike Bordick. Used as a utility player in Baltimore, things changed in 2003, when an injury-depleted Orioles team began using Mora almost exclusively in left field, and Mora responded with the best stretch of his career. He reached base in 32 straight games while using a 23-game hitting streak to temporarily become the American League batting leader. Finally excelling as a hitter, Mora was chosen for his first All-Star selection. Mora&#x27;s season was cut short due to injuries (a bruised wrist and a partially torn ligament in his left knee), but finished with a .317 batting average, 15 home runs, and a .418 on-base percentage in 96 games.

====2004====
Mora&#x27;s 2003 season proved that he could be a consistent hitter at the major league level. In 2004, Mora became the Orioles&#x27; regular third baseman and enjoyed his most productive season in the majors. Mora hit a career-high .340, finishing second in the AL batting race to Ichiro Suzuki&#x27;s .372 mark; led the league in on-base percentage (.419); ranked fifth in slugging average (.562) and OPS (.981); sixth in runs (111), doubles (41) and times on base (264); eighth in hits (187), and ninth in total bases (264). His 27 home runs and 104 RBI were also career-highs, while leading his team in batting average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging average and OPS. At third base, he improved and became more consistent as the season wore on. Mora finished 18th in American League MVP voting and won a Silver Slugger Award.

====2005–07====

In 2005, Mora once again hit 27 home runs, although his batting average and on-base percentage dropped. On May 19, 2006, Mora agreed to a three-year, $25 million deal that included a no-trade clause because Mora did not want to move his family to another city.

In 2006, Mora&#x27;s home run total dropped to 16, and again dropped in 2007 to 14. Mora also saw his batting average fall to .274 for both seasons.

====2008====
Mora was named American League Player of the Month for August 2008. Mora batted .418 (41-for-98) with eight home runs and had an MLB-leading 32 RBIs in 24 games. He posted a .765 slugging percentage and a .455 on-base percentage, with 17 extra-base hits, including eight doubles. Mora had a 13 multi-hit games in August 2008 and maintained an eight-game hitting streak from August 1–10. On August 17 at Detroit, Mora went 5-for-6 with two doubles, two home runs, four runs scored and 6 RBI during a 16–8 Orioles win. Overall, Mora had five games in August in which he collected four-or-more RBIs. Mora injured his hamstring on August 29, 2008, missing the final games of his impressive month.

====2009====
On September 18, 2009, Brooks Robinson made a rare appearance at Camden Yards to honor Mora for moving into second all-time in games played at third base by an Oriole (behind only the Hall of Famer Brooks, himself). He presented Mora with the third base from the game he moved into second.

In 2009, he led all major league starting third basemen in range factor, at 3.14.

Mora&#x27;s option was declined by the Orioles on October 29, 2009.

===Colorado Rockies===
On February 5, 2010, the Colorado Rockies signed Mora to a one-year, $1.275 million contract. He played in 113 games for the NL West third place Rockies (83-79) and batted .285 with seven home runs and 45 RBI.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
Mora signed a one-year $2.35 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 6, 2010. He was expected to replace Mark Reynolds as the starting third baseman. Mora missed a few days of spring training as a precautionary measure despite not having any serious injuries after his automobile was struck from behind by another vehicle on Arizona State Route 101 on March 7, 2011. He was in the starting lineup on Opening Day, scoring a run while going hitless in five at-bats in a 7–6 victory over the Rockies at Coors Field on April 1. His playing time eventually was limited due to the emergence of Ryan Roberts. After a 6–2 loss to the Cleveland Indians at Chase Field on June 29 in which he struck out as a pinch hitter for Zach Duke with one out and a runner on first base in the fifth inning, he was given his unconditional release effective the following day. He batted .228 with no home runs and 16 RBI in 42 games with the Diamondbacks. He allegedly officially announced his retirement as an active player on December 29, 2011, though in mid-January, Mora corrected that claim by saying he still wished to play in 2012.

===World Baseball Classic===
Mora agreed to represent his native country, Venezuela, in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, but pulled out after being denied the third base position in favor of Miguel Cabrera.

==Highlights==
*2× All-Star (2003, 2005)
*2× American League Player of the Month (May 2004, August 2008)
*First player to hit a home run off the top of the foul pole at Camden Yards

==Career statistics==
In 1,556 games over 13 seasons, Mora posted a .277 batting average (1,503-for-5,422) with 794 runs, 283 doubles, 19 triples, 171 home runs, 754 RBI, 93 stolen bases, 520 bases on balls, a .350 on-base percentage and a .431 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage playing at all infield positions except catcher and at all three outfield positions. In nine postseason games, he hit .400 (6-for-15) with four runs, a home run and 2 RBI.

==Personal life==
When he was seven years old, his father was murdered in front of him in Venezuela in a case of mistaken identity.

On July 28, 2001, Mora&#x27;s wife Gisel gave birth to quintuplets at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. They also have an older daughter. The family resides in Fallston, Maryland.

In the Orioles media guide, Mora stated his most embarrassing moment as a player came in his rookie year in 1999 when, knowing little English, he thought his manager Bobby Valentine had told him to go to left field when he was actually being told to go to second base.

Mora was naturalized as a United States citizen in Baltimore on May 10, 2017. He holds U.S.-Venezuela dual citizenship.

<text>Bertalan Farkas (, born August 2, 1949) is the first Hungarian cosmonaut, space explorer and fighter pilot. Hungary became the seventh nation to be represented in space by him. Farkas is also the first Esperantist cosmonaut. He is currently the president of Airlines Service and Trade. 

Following his mission, Hungarian-American Károly Simonyi (Charles Simonyi) was the second Hungarian astronaut – the only person in the entire world who has been twice in space as a space tourist and who had paid for himself for the spaceflights. The next Hungarian astronaut will travel to the International Space Station by 2025.

==Early life and military career==

Born in Gyulaháza, he graduated from the György Kilián Aeronautical College in Szolnok in 1969. He then attended the Krasnodar Military Aviation Institute in the Soviet Union, from where he graduated in 1972.

After earning his qualifications at university, Farkas joined the Hungarian Air Force and rose to the rank of Brigadier General.

He also attended the Bessenyei György Gimnázium in Kisvárda.

==Intercosmos program==

In 1978 he volunteered to become a cosmonaut and was selected as part of the fifth international programme for Interkosmos. His backup cosmonaut was Béla Magyari.

Farkas, along with Soviet cosmonaut Valery Kubasov, was launched into space on Soyuz 36 from Baikonur Cosmodrome on May 26, 1980, at 18:20 (UTC).

While in orbit, Farkas conducted experiments in materials science. After 7 days, 20 hours and 45 minutes, and having completed 124 orbits, Farkas and Kubasov returned to Earth, landing 140 km southeast of Jezkazgan. Bertalan Farkas was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on June 30, 1980.

==Personal life==

Farkas is married to Anikó Farkas, and has four children: Gábor, Aida, Ádám and Bertalan. He loves tennis and plays it often.

He was a member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, a Hungarian conservative political party, and was its candidate at the 2006 parliamentary election in the Baktalórántháza election district. He holds the rank of Commander (CLJ) in the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem in Hungary.

<text>Noor Mohamed Hassanali (; 13 August 1918 – 25 August 2006) was a Trinidadian lawyer, judge and politician who served as the second president of Trinidad and Tobago from 1987 to 1997. A retired high-court judge, he was the first person of Indian descent along with being the first Muslim to hold the office of President of Trinidad and Tobago, and he was the first Muslim head of state in the Americas.

Hassanali was president during the 1990 Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt when an Islamist group bombed the nation&#x27;s police headquarters, stormed its Parliament and took the prime minister and his Cabinet hostage. Hassanali, who was visiting London at the time and remained there until the government regained control, aided in calming his fellow citizens and getting rule of law and democracy back on track on his return. His tenure, though largely ceremonial, was noted for its efforts to bridge the nation&#x27;s racial divide and building consensus between various political parties.

==Biography==
The sixth of seven children, Hassanali was born into a Indo-Trinidadian Muslim family in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. He attended the Corinth Canadian Mission Primary School and Naparima College. After graduating he taught at Naparima from 1938 to 1943. In 1943 he travelled to Canada, where he studied at the University of Toronto.

Hassanali was described as &quot;one of the most neutral, reserved, and dignified figures in the history of T&amp;T politics&quot;. When he was inaugurated as president in 1987 he was described as &quot;a person of impeccable credentials who has a reputation for honesty and humility of the highest order.&quot; As a Muslim, Hassanali chose not to serve alcoholic beverages at President&#x27;s House. Despite reservations on the part of Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson, the decision was never seen as controversial by the public.

Hassanali succeeded acting president Ellis Clarke (1976–1987) and was himself succeeded by Arthur N. R. Robinson (president 1997–2003).

Hassanali died on 25 August 2006 at his home in Westmoorings, Trinidad and Tobago, at the age of 88. He had suffered from hypertension for the preceding year. Hassanali was buried later in the day, following Islamic rites, in the Western Cemetery in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago.

<doc id="701585" wikidata="Q3308917" url="?curid=701585" title="Hiram Walker">
<text>Hiram Walker (July 4, 1816 – January 12, 1899) was an American entrepreneur and founder of the Hiram Walker and Sons Ltd. distillery in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Walker was born in East Douglas, Massachusetts, and moved to Detroit in 1838. He purchased land across the Detroit River, just east of what is Windsor, Ontario, and established a distillery in 1858 in what would become Walkerville, Ontario. Walker began selling his whisky as Hiram Walker&#x27;s Club Whisky, in containers that were &quot;clearly marked&quot; and he used a process to make his whisky that was vastly different from all other distillers.

It became very popular, angering American distillers, who forced the US government to pass a law requiring that all foreign whiskeys state their country of origin on the label. From this point forward, Hiram Walker&#x27;s Canadian Club whisky was Canada&#x27;s top export whisky. He established and maintained the company town that grew around his distillery, exercising planning and control over every facet of the town, from public works to religious services to police and fire control.

The Hiram Walker &amp; Sons Distillery remained in the Walker family until 1926 when they sold it to Harry C. Hatch for $15,000,000, . While the company has gone through several owners and is now part of Pernod Ricard, the Canadian Club brand is owned by Suntory Global Spirits, a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Japan. Canadian Club whisky is still produced at the distillery site Walker founded.

==Early life==
Hiram Walker was born on July 4, 1816, on a family farm in Douglas, Massachusetts. He was the sixth generation of English immigrants; his father was a reputable schoolmaster. His ancestors can be traced back to Thomas Walker of Boston, who emigrated to America from England. His father died when he was aged 9. Douglas, Massachusetts was a small town, with a population of 1,800, and very few businesses, which include a planing mill, a machine shop, cotton factory and forge. He received a &quot;common&quot; school education in Boston, and began working as a dry goods clerk. He left for Detroit, Michigan, in 1838, at the age of 22 years. Detroit was a vast change from Boston at the time, as Detroit had a smaller population, where Walker was able to find employment. His first employment in Detroit was as a grocery clerk at a store owned by Augustus Gardner, east of Woodward Avenue. His general tasks were to order, receive, check and price out all the goods in which the company dealt. Through this, he gained knowledge and experience of the business world. At this time, Boston was the major metropolis of New England. Walker, as well as many other youthful New Englanders, were drawn to the opportunity of the Mid-West and beyond, largely due to the expansion and development of the railway.

==Marriage and family==
On October 5, 1846, at age thirty, Walker married Mary Abigail Williams. Mary Williams and Hiram Walker had 7 children, 5 boys and 2 girls, but one of the girls died at age 13.

His wife was the daughter of Ephraim Smith Williams and Hannah Melissa Gotee of Silver Lake, Michigan. Mary Abigail, like Walker, was the descendant of new England pioneers, whose familial roots traced back to Massachusetts in 1638. On her mother&#x27;s side, Mary Abigail was the descendant of French merchants.

He had two daughters, Julia Elizabeth and Jennie Melissa, and five sons, Willis Ephraim, Edward Chandler, Franklin Hiram, Alfred (infant), and James Harrington. Edward Chandler, his second son, commissioned the development of Willistead Manor.

== Adult life ==
Throughout his life, Walker remained an American citizen. For a period of five years from 1859 until 1864, he lived in Windsor in a residence named the &quot;Cottage&quot; on land that was part of the Labadie holdings which Walker originally purchased. The &quot;Cottage&quot;, a large home for the period, had a third story as well as a large verandah.
==Business history==

===Early years===

Walker was not new to the world of business. Since his migration to Detroit he had been involved in several different projects. In his earlier days he worked as a grocery clerk from 1838 until 1845 for several different employers. Eventually, after being involved in the grocery business for several years, he took it upon himself to begin operating a grocery store of his own in 1846 which did not last. Following his work as a clerk, Walker was employed at the firm of Ingersoll and Kirby, a leather and leather goods business. Through this, he gained his first knowledge into the business world. By 1845, Walker saved enough money as a clerk to invest in a business, the firm of Walker and Parker, which specialized in tanning and leather sales. However, this partnership dissolved in 1846, and Walker returned to the grocery business. Eventually, the same tannery business that he invested in was burned down in 1848.

Walker was well-regarded as a proficient businessman, noted for his involvement in a wide range of different businesses and industries. Some associate his success with his ability to dabble in multiple business opportunities as well as jump quickly on prospective businesses. This can be seen, for example, during his grocery business between 1849 and 1858 when Walker had the idea to produce his own vinegar. His beginnings in the distillery business have been traced to January 1849, where an advertisement in a Detroit newspaper publicized Walker&#x27;s &quot;barrels of cider vinegar&quot; and &quot;wheat whisky&quot;. It was advertised for 10 cents per gallon. Through this business, he began to distill his own vinegar, which became popular in the area because of its consistency, low price, and high quality. He then sold it at his grocery store, to other grocers as well as across the River in Windsor via door-to-door sales. Thus, the vinegar factory became another successful business venture for Walker which, after years of success in Detroit, he sold in 1858.

It is true that it was the manufacturing of vinegar led to Walker&#x27;s eventual shift to the manufacturing of whisky. However, he had been selling alcohol since 1849 and continued to at the time he actually began to distill. He also was involved in the grain business, through serving as a supplier to the local flour mills in the Detroit area.

===Development of Walker’s distillery===
Through his work in the grocery business, as well as his cider and wheat sales, he had nearly $40,000 saved, which he then used to purchase additional space in Detroit and inexpensive land across the Detroit River, in what is now Windsor, Ontario, in order to expand his business. He did have interest in distilling his own liquor, but at the time, there were strict prohibition laws which prevented him from doing so. Walker distilled his first barrel of whisky in 1854, despite the instability of prohibition laws. After 5 years of distilling in Detroit he ended that particular business there.

Walker was considered one of the largest landowners in Ontario, and over his entire lifetime, his land possessions measured around 10,000 acre, most of which along the Walkerville and Detroit River Railroad The location of Walker&#x27;s property, on what was originally considered part of the Labdie farm, was extremely valuable because the Great Western Railway was in close proximity and enabled Walker to move products from his distillery and cattle yards.

Whisky makers before Walker ran spirits and whisky through charcoal, until around 1855, but Walker&#x27;s method of utilizing a barrel to &quot;create colour&quot; and a pleasing flavour was unprecedented.

A huge demand for Walker&#x27;s whisky and flour originated through the Civil War. It was at this time, that smuggling became common via the Detroit River. There is a legend that Walker built a &quot;liquor pipeline&quot; under the Detroit River for smuggling purposes.

Being an entrepreneur, Walker looked at every single business venture possible to be able to expand his business. Since Detroit was only a boat-ride across the river to Windsor, Canada, Walker began to weigh his options in expanding into foreign territory. Canada had much to offer entrepreneurs and business risktakers. The population was increasing gradually, communications were advancing, and real estate was cheaper compared to that from across the river. Labour and materials also cost less in Canada than it did in the States. Walker looked into expanding over to Canada. Also with the expansion of America through the Great Western Railroad, trade opportunities opened up for businessmen like Walker. Walker ventured into Canada across the border from Detroit into what is currently known as Essex County. At this time, the population in this area was considerably smaller than that of Detroit merely consisting of small village settlements under the Township of Sandwich such as the villages of Windsor and Sandwich. Most of the land in this area was vast farm land. In 1856, he bought his first piece of land from the Labadie family through grandson Eugene Hall for £300. This transaction took place on December 22, 1856, using the British currency system that Canada was still employing at the time. A month later, on January 24, 1857, he decided to acquire another 300 acres of land for which he paid £750. Also on this day, he purchased yet another 104 acres for £250. The remainder of 1857 involved building on much of this land and Walker, still a resident of Detroit, often crossed the border to oversee the construction being done. His plan was to open a steam-powered flour mill, which did not exist in the area, and a distillery, in which he had very little serious competition. He also had his hands in the agricultural industry with owning cattle and hogs, as well as farming.

In 1857, Walker bought more property near the farm he already owned, increasing his holdings to 468 acres. He began construction of the flour mill and distillery in the same year, which he visited every day during construction even though he still resided in America. He continued his grocery business in the meantime, helping him become the leading commission merchant in Detroit.

The year 1858 marked the completion of the flour mill and distillery that Walker was building in Canada and at this time business could begin. During this time he still maintained his very successful grain business in the United States. The flour that would be produced in his flour mill would prove to be popular not only in Canada but also in the United States and Britain. His introduction of a large steam flouring mill benefited the County of Essex&#x27;s farming community, which at this time made up most of the population, by encouraging farming practices. Wheat farmers from all around would go and use the flour mill as it gained in popularity.

The distillery was also becoming quite popular with the locals at this time. Mid-summer 1858 marked the opening of Walker&#x27;s whisky operation. The same process which he had used in Detroit was now used in Windsor to distill his alcohol. Spirits were leached through charcoal, a process widely used at the time.

His Canadian industries quickly took precedence over that of his grain business still located in Detroit. It was because of this that Walker found himself traveling by ferry to Canada from his home in Detroit on a daily basis. This trip was a lengthy process as the ferry that brought him to Canada dropped him off in Windsor, which left a long ride via horse and buggy to his flour mill and distillery. At this time in March 1859, Walker moved to Canada in order to save time traveling to and from his Canadian businesses. He moved out of the home he had been in since 1851 and into a house located near the flour mill, which he altered and called &quot;The Cottage&quot;.

The Cottage was a home that previously had been owned by the Labadie family, from whom Walker had purchased much of the land on which his industries were now located. This framed house was built in 1839 and resembled the French style of residences prevalent in the area. Walker made several modifications to the home including two large additions at each end of the home, the addition of a third floor as well as servants dwellings. In the few years that Walker lived in Canada he remained at The Cottage.

The new Canadian business helped spur other ventures for Walker. He tried hog farming for a while, until cholera broke out, when he switched to cattle farming instead.

In 1859, Walker hired John McBride, one of his workers from Detroit, to be his traveling salesman. His job was to solicit orders from vendors who might be interested in purchasing the product. Taken from Walker &amp; Sons Ltd. Archive The year of 1860 saw some of the highest production because both his mill and distillery were running almost non-stop. 1861 and 1862 marked the first years of paying back many expenses and seeing the beginning of profits. Operations became larger and more continuous as farmers, salesmen, and office staff would find themselves very busy. In 1863, Walker made McBride his partner, changing the name of the business to Hiram Walker and Company.
A massive source of profits for Hiram Walker was actually the Civil War in the United States. The U.S dollar plummeted during this time, and Americans turned to smuggling in Canadian beverages. It is reported that Hiram Walker and Company loaded jug after jug of whiskey onto American ferries, carrying them across the Detroit River, leading to Walker making massive profits. Jealous competitors constructed a story of Walker creating a lead pipe that led right from the distillery, under the Detroit River, and into Detroit. By 1863, Walker had named James Ellis in charge of his mill, William McManus as his distiller, and John McBride in charge of managing. While a majority of his business did take place on the Canadian side of the border, he did prefer to live in Detroit. 
In 1863, he bought a home within Detroit. Walker also attempted to construct and run a vinegar factory in 1864, but was unsuccessful and closed down two years later due to his other commitments. Up until 1865, Walker&#x27;s distillery was the only one to exist in Essex County, however, Walker found himself with competition with Rolph and Melchers. During this time, Walker&#x27;s partner McBride was anxious to move up the chain within the company. Two years later, John McBride and two of his friends bought Rolph and Melchers. After discovering what McBride had done, his employment was terminated and Walker lost his business partner. Ironically, McBride and his partners would end up having to sell their property to Walker because they were going out of business and it was operated by Hiram Walker as a second plant until 1876. John McBride would go on to become a tax collector and grocery store owner in Detroit.

===Involvement with Detroit newspapers===
Walker became heavily involved with Detroit newspapers during the mid-1860s and 1870s. He bought $10,000 worth of stock in the newspaper known as the &quot;Advertiser and Tribune&quot;. Their largest competitor of the time was the &quot;Daily Post&quot;, which proved to be a fierce rival. Walker constantly put forth suggestions of a merger, but his requests were constantly denied. By 1872, Walker purchased another $10,000 in shares, becoming the primary shareholder in the newspaper. The following year, the senior editor of the &quot;Advertiser and Tribune&quot; had resigned, and Walker immediately bought the stock he had in the company. J.E. Scripps, the former senior editor of the &quot;Advertiser and Tribune&quot;, soon opened his own newspaper, the &quot;Evening News&quot;. This divided the competition even further. In 1877, the &quot;Advertiser and Tribune&quot; merged with the &quot;Daily Post&quot; under the name the &quot;Post and Tribune&quot;, as Walker had wanted. Two years later, a fire burned down the offices of the newspaper and Walker was estimated to have lost $30,000. Walker lost interest in the newspaper business soon after and sold the &quot;Post and Tribune&quot; to James McMillan.

===Walkerville===

Walker started his milling and distilling business in the town of Sandwich, near Windsor, Ontario. Farmers and other people who worked in Windsor aided Walker with his distilling business. The economic growth that encapsulated the Township of Sandwich started with Walker transforming his property (Labadie Farm) into one with new industrial buildings. These buildings, like the &quot;Walker Mill&quot; and the &quot;Walker Pens&quot; were places people living in the area could bring their wheat and pigs, creating a connection between Walker and his community. Eventually, the name for the section where Walker and his business peaked was called &quot;Walkerton&quot; but there was already a town in the province of Ontario with that name, so Walker and the other citizens settled with &quot;Walkerville&quot; but often referred to it as &quot;Walkers Town&quot;.

With the growth of the distillery and the flour mill, Walker expanded the business in many ways. He began to build Walker Road in 1860, and hire many employees, such as salesmen, office workers or skilled trade workers. With this developed an increase in population in the area, especially in respects to it being centralized around the mill and distillery. On March 1, 1869, Walker’s Town established its first post office. This is when the government recognized the small hamlet as the name it is known by today, Walkerville.

Walker is recognized as the man who gave momentum to such aspects that benefited the community like trading, agricultural work, stock raising, building industries, and most importantly, inspired those who surrounded his perseverance and progressive attitudes. Walker build homes for his employees and rented them out at reasonable prices, and also created public utilities, paved the streets, and paid for and encouraged people to get an education. One of the most popular institutions Walker erected was a Methodist church in 1870. It was converted into an Anglican church in 1874, and renamed St. Mary’s, in honour of Walker’s late wife, Mary.

As mentioned, the heart of Walkerville was Walker’s distilling business, &quot;Hiram Walker and Sons&quot; which was established in 1858. Walker’s business created an expansion of the town that included, malt houses, cooperage, copper shop, planning mill, lumber yard, brick yard, and a ferry between Walkerville and Detroit. The trip from his house in Detroit to his businesses in Walkerville took approximately an hour and a half. Due to this, Walker decided to invest in a ferry that would travel between Detroit and Walkerville as to save time and be of assistance to the public. In 1880 he finally decided to rent a ferry that would travel from Detroit and Walkerville. The ferry he would lease was called &quot;The Essex&quot; which was a steam ship built in, 1858 in Walkerville. He installed a dock system on his land in Walkerville that would allow people to board the ferry. In its beginnings the ferry was not very useful for the people of Walkerville as it mainly served as a personal transportation service for Walker himself. It did not follow a set schedule and did not make very many trips on any given day. However, in the following year of 1881, a set schedule was developed and the ferry as a public service began. It was also during this year that another ferry, called &quot;Ariel&quot;, replaced &quot;The Essex&quot; due to the termination of the lease.

Furthermore, with the construction of a railway by the Essex and Detroit Railway Company, which ran through Walkerville until Kingsville, encouraged many businesses to move from Windsor to the Township of Walkerville because of transportation opportunities. The amount of new industries and people in Walkerville because of these transportation opportunities led to the creation of good roads that could sustain heavy traffic, traffic lights, police and fire fighters, proper sanitary measures. All of these necessities for a town to properly function could not be afforded by the rural municipality of Sandwich East (what Walkerville was called before its official name) so Hiram Walker and Son’s funded everything. Walker paid for the following: water, 52 fire fighters, the fire appliances, two police officers that rotated shifts, repairs of streets and sidewalks, the night watch service, and the electric lighting of the streets, the Music Hall, the Anglican Church, and some privately owned houses. Walker’s efforts to make Walkerville a legitimate town, no weaker than any other, led to his title as Walkerville’s mayor. Walker created a town council that included, the mayor (Walker), councilors, clerks, treasurers, medical health officers, collectors, assessors, auditors, solicitors, and the chief of police and policeman. The town council’s first meeting was held May 12, 1890, in a building near Walker Road, owned by Walker and Sons. The first major act done by the Walkerville’s council was to create an event honouring the efforts of the creator of Walkerville (Walker) that would fall on his birthday, July 4. A bronze emblem was created by New York&#x27;s Tiffany and Co. that displays three Cossack foragers on horseback returning from an expedition, with an inscription that reads, &quot;Presented to Hiram Walker, on the 74th anniversary of his birthday, by his friends in the County of Essex, a token of respect and gratitude for Hiram’s efforts with the creation of the Town of Walkerville.&quot;

The Walkerville community received a large reward in 1890. Through heavy petitioning, especially from that of the Walker family, the community became an incorporated town. This released the burden of paying for many services from the Walker company. The City of Windsor was developing around this time, and by Walkerville becoming incorporated, it also helped the town ward off annexation with Windsor. Walkerville became a town on April 7, 1890. In honour of the incorporation and in gratitude to its founder, Walker received a bronze statue made by Tiffany’s. The ceremony took place on Walker’s birthday, July 4, which was declared by town council to be a public holiday.

One of Walkerville’s great concerns was to be annexed with Windsor. The town tried and tried, yet eventually efforts failed and the two communities , with Walkerville becoming a neighbourhood near East Windsor. Although Walkerville is a neighbourhood within the larger city limits, it still holds distinct historical significance.

==The Pregnant-Cow Case==
Walker was also a cattle breeder and was party to a famous contracts case, &quot;Sherwood v. Walker&quot;, known as &quot;The Pregnant-Cow Case&quot;. (33 N.W. 919 (Mich. 1887).) According to the majority opinion, Walker agreed with Theodore Sherwood, a banker, to sell him a cow of distinguished ancestry known as &quot;Rose 2d of Aberlone&quot;. The price was $80, both parties believing Rose to be sterile. When Walker discovered that she was pregnant and worth between $750 and $1,000, he refused to deliver her. Sherwood sued and prevailed in the trial court, but lost on appeal. This case illustrates the contract law rules of rescission of contract by mutual mistake. Because both parties believed they were contracting for a sterile cow, there was a mutual mistake of fact, and therefore ground for rescission. However, the dissent in the case, written by Justice Sherwood, notes that Sherwood believed that Rose &quot;might be made to breed&quot; and purchased her on that chance.

==Philanthropy==
Walker was a charitable man and donated his money throughout Detroit and the Windsor/Walkerville area. Walker spent 25 years in the church of St. Paul’s in Detroit as a vestryman. As a member of the church, he is often remembered for having donated large amounts of money to the parish community and refused to be recognized in any way. He never took any public position within the church, but continued to be the prominent fundraiser in the church for any task the community was trying to accomplish. Walker enjoyed his work within the church, and saw the community as a place that could do a lot of good work. During his time there, he met and befriended all kinds of influential people including other businessmen, doctors, and even judges. In 1874, he donated approximately $5000 worth of bread to families in Walkerville, Windsor, and Detroit. In 1887, Walker made a financial gift to found Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan, part of the Detroit Medical Center. He donated nearly $125,000 to the Children&#x27;s Free Hospital Association, and undertook the responsibility of constructing a suitable building for the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan. In Walker&#x27;s will of 1896, he donated seven eighths of all his Detroit property &quot;of which he might be possessed at the time of his death&quot; to Children&#x27;s Hospital of Michigan, and the remaining one eighth to Harper Hospital.

Walker built a railway costing him $20,000 because of weak transportation in the South, which had to be approved by the Detroit River Railway Company that eventually led to the laying of the railways steel in 1888. The railway extended from Walkerville, to South Harrow, to the outskirts of Kingsville. The railway had a distance of 27 miles and on April 6, 1888, the Government of Canada granted a subsidy of $118,400, beginning the construction of the railway. The expansion of this railway led to Hiram Walker and Sons business and other businesses being able to branch out as far as Ruthven, further expanding the success of Walker’s distilling company.

He also contributed money towards the founding of the Detroit Art Museum.

== Death ==

Walker had fallen ill many times since 1883. Due to his illness, he spent a lot of time at home, and on the water in Lake Erie. A popular spot in which he journeyed to often was an island he owned known as the Ile Aux Peche, which he sold to his daughter. He lost feeling in his right leg around 1890 due to his rheumatism and walked with a cane. In 1895, he suffered a severe paralytic stroke and lost the feeling in his legs two years later. From April 1898 until his death, he suffered two cases of Congestive Apoplexy. His second attack was on January 10, 1899. Walker died two days later in Detroit, Michigan, January 12, 1899. He is buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.
His direct descendants are of the Julia Elizabeth (Walker) Buhl, Franklin MacFie Walker and Elizabeth Talman (Walker) Paterson families.

The news of the death of Walker took a large toll on the town. Flags were lowered, and mayor Robert Kerr made a public statement. Walker’s casket remained in his residence in Detroit until the funeral took place. The Detroit News reported that family, friends and fellow co-workers visited for hours prior to the funeral service on January 14, 1899. The casket made entirely of metal, but covered with black and massive floral decorations, which was incredibly rare for the time. The flowers were donated by Hiram Walker &amp; Sons, along with the Children&#x27;s Free Hospital.

In July 2022, in honour of Walker&#x27;s 206th birthday, Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens unveiled a bronze Statue of Walker at Hiram Walker Parkette (Devonshire Road at Riverside Drive East).

<text>A zebroid is the offspring of any cross between a zebra and any other equine to create a hybrid. In most cases, the sire is a zebra stallion but not every time. The offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam, called a donkra, and the offspring of a horse sire and a zebra dam, called a hebra, do exist, but are rare and are usually sterile. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. Charles Darwin noted several zebra hybrids in his works.

==Types==
Zebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a portmanteau of the &#x27;s name and the &#x27;s name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of dwarfism. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in sterile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring phenotype.

A zorse is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a horse mare. This cross is also called a zebrose, zebrula, zebrule, or zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a hebra, horsebra, zebrinny, or zebra hinny. Like most other animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.

A zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare. Medium-sized pony mares are preferred to produce riding zonies, but zebras have been crossed with smaller pony breeds such as the Shetland, resulting in so-called &quot;Zetlands&quot;.

A cross between a zebra and a donkey is known as a zenkey, zonkey (a term also used for donkeys in Tijuana, Mexico, painted as zebras for tourists to pose with them in souvenir photos), zebrass, or zedonk. Donkeys are closely related to zebras and both animals belong to the horse family. These zebra–donkey hybrids are very rare. In South Africa, they occur where zebras and donkeys are found in proximity to each other. Like mules and hinnies, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting meiosis.

== Genetics ==

Living equids show wide variation in the number of chromosomes, ranging from a diploid number of 32 chromosomes in the mountain zebra to 66 in Przewalski&#x27;s horse. This is due to several chromosomal fusion and fission events during the evolution of equids. The zebra has between 32 and 46 chromosomes depending on the species.

In spite of this difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid will have a number of chromosomes exactly halfway between that of its parents; for example, a cross between a horse (64 chromosomes), and a plains zebra (44 chromosomes), will produce a zebroid offspring with 54 chromosomes. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called Haldane&#x27;s rule. The evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane first recorded in 1922 that genetic hybrids are often inviable or sterile. Since none of the males are fertile, the females must be paired with either a donkey or a zebra. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.

=== Extant &quot;Equus&quot; species: chromosome number ===
Zebras are more closely related to wild asses (a group which includes donkeys) than to horses. The horse lineage diverged from other equids an estimated 4.0 - 4.7 million years ago; zebras and asses diverged an estimated 1.69–1.99 million years ago. The cladogram of &quot;Equus&quot; below is simplified from Vistrup &quot;et al.&quot; (2013).

==Physical characteristics==

Zebroids physically resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes generally do not cover the whole body and might be confined to the legs, or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the non-zebra parent was patterned (such as a roan, Appaloosa, pinto/paint, piebald, or skewbald), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name &quot;golden zebra&quot; relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse&#x27;s bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct quagga. Zebra–donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.
Zorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on coloured areas of the hybrid&#x27;s coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-colored horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (color other than black and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The tobiano (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give it white markings. Only the non-depigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a horse stallion called Ulysses.

Zonkeys tend to be either tan, brown or grey in colour from their donkey parent with a lighter underside, and it is on the lighter parts of their body like their legs and belly with stripes on some parts from their zebra parent.

Zebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a horse or a donkey and, consequently, it is difficult to find tack to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a purebred horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, can pass on their wild traits to their offspring. Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.

==Historical and notable zebroids==
In 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut Arabian mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882-1927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of telegony, or paternal impression. In &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; (1859), Charles Darwin mentioned four colored drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote

In Lord Morton&#x27;s famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.

In his book &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot;, Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a &quot;triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra&quot; displayed at London Zoo. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.

During the South African War, the Boers crossed Chapman&#x27;s zebras with ponies to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces, presented to King Edward VII by Lord Kitchener and photographed by W. S. Berridge. Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.

Grévy&#x27;s zebra has been crossed with the Somali wild ass in the early 20th century. Zorses were bred by the U.S. government and reported in &quot;Genetics in Relation to Agriculture&quot; by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in &quot;The Science of Life&quot; by H. G. Wells, J. Huxley and G. P. Wells (around 1929).

Interest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a &quot;hamzab&quot;. In the 1970s, the Colchester Zoo in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last one died in 2009. As of 2010, one adult still remained at the tourist attraction of Groombridge Place near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.

===21st century===
Today, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos. A zorse (more accurately a zony) was born at Eden Ostrich World, Cumbria, England, in 2001, after a zebra was left in a field with a Shetland pony. It was referred to as a Zetland. Usually, a zebra stallion is paired with a horse mare or donkey jenny, but in 2005, a Burchell&#x27;s zebra mare named Allison produced a zonkey called Alex, sired by a donkey jack at Highland Plantation in the parish of Saint Thomas, Barbados. Alex, born 21 April 2005, is apparently the first zonkey in Barbados. In 2007, a horse stallion, Ulysses, and a zebra mare, Eclipse, produced a hebra named Eclyse, displaying an unusually patchy color coating. In July 2010, a zonkey was born at the Chestatee Wildlife Preserve in Dahlonega, Georgia. Another zebra–donkey hybrid, like the Barbados zonkey sired by a donkey, was born 3 July 2011 in Haicang Safari Park, Haicang, Xiamen, China. A zonkey, Ippo, was born 21 July 2013 in an animal reserve in Florence, Italy. Khumba, the offspring of a zebra mare and a dwarf albino donkey jack, was born on 21 April 2014 in the zoo of Reynosa in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. More recently, in November 2018 at a farm in Somerset, a cross between a donkey jack and a zebra mare was born. The male foal was described as a zonkey by its owner and has been named Zippy.

<text>Beverly Heather D&#x27;Angelo (born November 15, 1951) is an American actress who starred as Ellen Griswold in the &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; films (1983–2015). She has appeared in over 60 films and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her role as Patsy Cline in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1980), and for an Emmy Award for her role as Stella Kowalski in the TV film &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1984). D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s other film roles include Sheila Franklin in &quot;Hair&quot; (1979) and Doris Vinyard in &quot;American History X&quot; (1998).

==Early life==
D&#x27;Angelo was born in Columbus, Ohio, the daughter of Priscilla Ruth ( Smith), a violinist, and Eugene Constantino &quot;Gene&quot; D&#x27;Angelo, a bass player and television station manager at WBNS-TV in Columbus. Her father was of Italian descent. Her paternal grandparents, Eugenio and Rosina D&#x27;Angelo were from Introdacqua in the Abruzzo region of Italy. She has three brothers, Jeff, Tim and Tony. Their maternal grandfather, Howard Dwight Smith, was an architect who designed the Ohio Stadium, nicknamed &quot;the Horseshoe&quot; at Ohio State University.

D&#x27;Angelo attended Upper Arlington High School in Upper Arlington, Ohio, a northwest Columbus suburb. In 2009, she was awarded the Upper Arlington Alumni Association (UAAA) Distinguished Alumnus Award for achievement in her career.

D&#x27;Angelo worked as an illustrator at Hanna-Barbera Studios and as a singer before pursuing an interest in acting. While living for a period in Canada, she was a backup singer for American-born rockabilly singer Rompin&#x27; Ronnie Hawkins&#x27; band The Hawks. After going out on their own they became The Band, a group that is considered legendary.

==Career==
D&#x27;Angelo began acting in the theatre, appearing on Broadway in 1976 in &quot;Rockabye Hamlet&quot; (also known as &quot;Kronborg: 1582&quot;), a musical based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. She made her television debut in the first three episodes of the TV mini-series &quot;Captains and the Kings&quot; in 1976.

After gaining a minor role in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; in 1977, D&#x27;Angelo appeared in a string of hit films in the late 1970s including &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;, &quot;Hair&quot;, and &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, the last earning her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Patsy Cline. She won a Country Music Association award for Album of the Year.

Her biggest break came in 1983 starring with Chevy Chase in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; in the role of Ellen Griswold. She reprised this role in four &quot;Vacation&quot; &quot;sequels&quot; (1985&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot;, 1989&#x27;s &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot;, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot;, and 2015&#x27;s &quot;Vacation&quot;), and a 2010 &quot;short film&quot;. In the 1980s, she starred in many other comedy films such as &quot;Maid to Order&quot; (1987) and &quot;High Spirits&quot; (1988); in the mid-1990s she acted primarily in independent films. In 1994, D&#x27;Angelo returned to the stage and won a Theatre World Award for her performance in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Simpatico&quot;. In 1998, she played Doris Vinyard (the mother of Edward Norton&#x27;s character) in the crime drama &quot;American History X&quot;.

She received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Stella Kowalski in the 1984 TV film version of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. She later had main roles in a number of made-for-television dramatic films, including &quot;Slow Burn&quot; (1986), &quot;Hands of a Stranger&quot; (1987), &quot;Judgment Day: The John List Story&quot; (1993), &quot;&quot; (1994), and &quot;Sweet Temptation&quot; (1996). In the 2000s, D&#x27;Angelo had a recurring role on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as defense attorney Rebecca Balthus. She also worked as a voice actress. In 1992 she had a guest appearance in the third season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as Lurleen Lumpkin, a Southern country singer and waitress in the &quot;Colonel Homer&quot; episode. Sixteen years later in 2008, she appeared in the nineteenth season as the same character in the episode &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Leech&quot;.

From 2005 to 2011, D&#x27;Angelo appeared in the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot; playing the role of agent Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Miller. In 2006 she starred in the independent film &quot;&quot;. In 2008, D&#x27;Angelo had a role in the film &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; as Sally. She played the housemother in the film &quot;The House Bunny&quot; (2008), and also appeared in the Tony Kaye film &quot;Black Water Transit&quot; (2009).

In 2014, D&#x27;Angelo was cast alongside Chevy Chase in an ABC comedy pilot called &quot;Chev &amp; Bev&quot;, about a retired couple having to raise their grandchildren. ABC opted against making a series. In 2022, she played Gertrude in the Christmas action comedy &quot;Violent Night&quot;.

D&#x27;Angelo narrates a short biographical film about Patsy Cline, which is shown to visitors of The Patsy Cline Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. The museum opened to the public on April 7, 2017.

==Personal life==
D&#x27;Angelo was romantically involved with Miloš Forman, who directed her in &quot;Hair&quot; (1979). In 1981, she married Italian Don Lorenzo Salviati, who is the only son and heir of Don Forese Salviati, 5th Duke Salviati, Marchese di Montieri and Boccheggiano, Nobile Romano Coscritto, and his wife, the former Maria Grazia Gawronska.

Later, she began a relationship with Anton Furst, an Academy Award-winning production designer, who died by suicide in 1991. She was in a relationship with actor Al Pacino from 1997 until 2003. The couple had twins conceived through IVF, a son and daughter born January 25, 2001.

<doc id="701614" wikidata="Q472942" url="?curid=701614" title="Jiang Yanyong">
<text>Jiang Yanyong (4 October 1931 – 11 March 2023) was a Chinese physician who publicized a coverup of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Mainland China. Born into the Zhejiang Xingye Bank family, Jiang was the chief physician of the 301 Hospital in Beijing and a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party.

Jiang was under periodic house arrest due to his role in exposing the coverup of SARS outbreak. According to a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jiang was portrayed as a bad role model in Chinese educational material, for &quot;harming the interests of the nation&quot;.

==Education ==
Jiang attended Yenching University. He chose a career in medicine after seeing an aunt die of tuberculosis. In 1952, he entered Peking Union Medical College. 

== Career ==
Jiang joined the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in 1954 and was assigned to the 301 Hospital (PLA General Hospital) in Beijing. In 1987, Jiang was named the hospital&#x27;s chief surgeon. He held the military rank of that is equivalent to a US Major General. In June 1989, Jiang witnessed the results of the trauma inflicted on the students during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

While the SARS virus began spreading in Mainland China in late 2002 and early 2003, the number of cases being reported in mainland China was drastically understated by the government. On 4 April 2003, Jiang emailed an 800-word letter to Chinese Central Television -4 (CCTV4) and Phoenix TV (Hong Kong) reporting that fact. Although neither of the two replied or published his letter, the information was leaked to the Western news organizations. On 8 April 2003, Jiang was reached by a journalist from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; through telephone interview. Later the same day, Susan Jakes, a &quot;Time&quot; journalist in Beijing also contacted Jiang. &quot;Time&quot; published the striking news right away with the title of &quot;Beijing&#x27;s SARS Attack&quot;. In this article, Jiang&#x27;s letter was translated into English and, for the first time, the public was made aware of the actual situation in Mainland China. This letter forced the resignation of the Mayor of Beijing and the Minister of Public Health on 21 April 2003. The Chinese government began to actively deal with the growing epidemic. Most public health experts believe that this act prevented the disease from reaching pandemic proportions.

In February 2004, Jiang wrote an open letter to Premier Wen Jiabao, several vice premiers, the Politburo members and many other members of the Chinese government. The letter asked for a re-examination of the responsibility borne by the Chinese government for the Tiananmen Square Massacre. A number of media sources indicate that because of Jiang Yanyong&#x27;s senior rank the topic of what to do with him was discussed by the Politburo.

On 2 June 2004, two days before the 15th anniversary of the massacre, Jiang Yanyong&#x27;s family in California reported that he and his wife were missing from their house in Beijing after being arrested and placed under military custody. He was released on 19 July 2004.

In March 2019, he wrote to Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping calling the crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square a crime. Jiang&#x27;s friends then reported that they lost contact with him and believed he was under house arrest. In February 2020, it was reported that he
&quot;has been placed under de facto house arrest since last year&quot;.

==Death==
Jiang died of pneumonia on 11 March 2023, at the age of 91.

==Awards==
In August 2004, Jiang was awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service. According to the board of trustees, &quot;The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation recognizes his brave stand for truth in Mainland China, spurring life-saving measures to confront and contain the deadly threat of SARS&quot;.

On 20 September 2007, the New York Academy of Sciences gave Jiang the Heinz R. Pagels Human Rights of Scientists Award.

<text>Surya Kiran () is an aerobatics demonstration team of the Indian Air Force. The Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) was formed in 1996 and is a part of the No. 52 Squadron of the Indian Air Force. The team is based at Bidar Air Force Station in Karnataka and has performed numerous demonstrations. The squadron was initially composed of the HAL HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 trainer aircraft. The team was suspended in February 2011 and was re-established with BAE Hawk Mk.132 aircraft in 2015.

==History==
In the late 1940s, the Indian Air Force (IAF) had a display flight squadron which carried out aerobatic displays on special occasions. The team flew Hawker Hunter aircraft and was led by Marshal Arjan Singh. The team led a flypast of more than hundred aircraft on the occasion of India&#x27;s Independence day in 1947. During the golden jubilee year of the Indian Air Force in 1982, select fighter pilots from various squadrons were assigned to the No. 20 Squadron (&quot;Lightnings&quot;) to form an aerobatic team called &quot;The Thunderbolts&quot;. Flying nine blue and white colored Hunter aircraft, the team performed aerobatic displays till 1989.
The Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) was formed in 1996 and was based at Bidar Air Force Station in Karnataka. The team and was initially composed of HAL HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 trainer aircraft. The team was formed under Wing Commander Kuldeep Malik who had been a member of the &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; on the eve of Aero India 1996, the first aerospace defense exhibition. The team initially flew four aircraft before moving to six aircraft formation in May 1996. The Surya Kiran team performed their first public display for the golden jubilee celebrations of Air Force Administrative College at Coimbatore on 15 September 1996.

In 1998, under the command of Wing Commander A. K. Murgai, the team expanded to a nine-aircraft formation which was displayed in public for the first time during the Independence Day celebrations in Red Fort. The team became the first Air Force unit to be awarded the Chief of Air Staff Unit Citation, which it received on 8 October 2004. Effective 1 May 2006, the team was accorded a separate squadron, becoming the No. 52 Squadron of the Indian Air Force nicknamed &quot;the Sharks&quot;. After Aero India 2011, the Surya Kiran team was grounded because the Air Force faced a shortage of Kiran training aircraft. In February 2015, the Surya Kiran team was re-formed with the induction of the British BAe Hawk trainer aircraft under the command of then Wing Commander Ajit Kulkarni.

==Aircraft and organization==

The Surya Kiran team operated HAL HJT-16 Kiran Mk.2 trainer aircraft from 1996 to 2011. In October 2015, an agreement was signed for the purchase of twenty BAE Systems Hawk Mk.132 aircraft fitted with smoke canisters dedicated to the aerobatics display role. The team has been utilizing the Hawk aircraft since 2015. The aircraft are painted in bright &quot;day-glo&quot; orange and white colour scheme. The inboard drop tanks of the aircraft are modified to carry color dye mixed with diesel fuel for generating colored smoke. 

The team has 13 pilots on roster of which nine fly at any given time. The pilots undergo a selection process twice a year and are chosen to serve for a three-year period. Besides the pilots, the team has a Flight Commander, an administrator and technical officers tasked with the maintenance and servicing of the aircraft.

===Commanders===
==Performance==
On an average, the team performs about 30 shows a year, and flies three sorties a day during the training season and two a day whilst on aerobatics display. The modified planes use aerosols to create various flight designs and patterns. The aircraft fly at speeds ranging from to and can reach speeds of up to while performing manoeuvres. The maneuvers subject the pilots to alternating g-forces between +6 and –1.5.

The Surya Kiran team performed their first public display with six aircraft for the golden jubilee celebrations of Air Force Administrative College at Coimbatore on 15 September 1996. In August 1998, the nine-aircraft formation was displayed in public for the first time during the Independence Day celebrations in New Delhi. The team gave its first performance abroad during the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lankan Air Force in March 2001. The team has performed over 500 displays in more than 72 cities across India. The team has performed at an altitude of in Srinagar and over the seas which is challenging due to the water affecting depth perception.

The team has also performed in various countries like China, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos and Singapore. The team has performed at multiple Aero India shows. In February 2004, the team performed at the Asian Aerospace air show in Singapore. The team performed in Malaysia in December 2007 at the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA) on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of Malaysia&#x27;s Independence. In December 2007, the team in coordination with the Royal Thai Air Force conducted a nine-aircraft display to commemorate the 80th Birth Anniversary of Bhumibol Adulyadej, the King of Thailand. In November 2008, the team was invited to participate in the Zhuhai Airshow in China and the team displayed in Laos during its return. After resurrection in 2015, the team performed their first performance abroad in March 2021 for the 70th anniversary of the Sri Lankan Air Force, exactly 20 years after the team’s very first foreign tour. On 19 November 2023, the team performed during the ICC Cricket World Cup final in Ahmedabad. On 6 October 2024, the team performed in the 92nd anniversary celebrations of the Indian Air Force at Marina Beach in Chennai.

<doc id="701618" wikidata="Q155038" url="?curid=701618" title="Germanwings">
<text>Germanwings GmbH was a German low-cost airline wholly owned by Lufthansa which operated under the Eurowings brand. It was based in Cologne with hubs at Cologne Bonn Airport, Stuttgart Airport, Hamburg Airport, Berlin Tegel Airport, Munich Airport and further bases at Hannover Airport and Dortmund Airport.

Germanwings operated independently as Lufthansa&#x27;s low-cost carrier until October 2015, when Lufthansa decided to fully transfer the brand identity of its low cost short haul-product to Eurowings. After 2016, Germanwings operated as a wet lease operator for its sister company Eurowings, with the Germanwings branding being phased out at this time. The IATA code &quot;4U&quot; continued to operate under the Eurowings brand until March 2018, when it was abandoned and replaced with the Eurowings designator &quot;EW&quot;. Germanwings was closed and merged back into Eurowings in April 2020 as part of a broad restructuring and the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
===Early years===
In 1997, Eurowings set up a low-cost department, which became a separate company under the name &quot;Germanwings&quot; on 27 October 2002. On 7 December 2005, the airline signed an agreement to purchase 18 Airbus A319-100 aircraft with a further 12 options, with deliveries scheduled from July 2006 until 2008.

During winter 2004–2005, Germanwings leased two Boeing 717-200s from Aerolíneas de Baleares to test the aircraft type, but no order was made afterwards.

In 2008, initial plans were made to merge Germanwings, Eurowings and TUIfly into one airline to compete with Air Berlin and its subsidiary LTU in the German market and with easyJet and Ryanair on international routes. However, these plans never realized. Instead, Germanwings became a wholly owned subsidiary of Lufthansa on 1 January 2009.

===Takeover of Lufthansa routes from 2012===
In 2012, Lufthansa announced its plans to transfer point-to-point shorthaul flights operating from cities other than Frankfurt and Munich from Lufthansa to Germanwings. Therefore, the company received a revised corporate design. The transfer of Lufthansa&#x27;s shorthaul routes occurred between spring 2013 and autumn 2014; Düsseldorf Airport was the last base transferred from March 2014.

As part of the 2013 restructuring and relaunch of Germanwings, around 30 Lufthansa aircraft were to be added to Germanwings&#x27; fleet of 33 aircraft. Additionally, the 23 aircraft currently operated by Eurowings for Lufthansa flights not flying out of Frankfurt and Munich were to join Germanwings. The new Germanwings was to operate around 90 aircraft.

The airline had a long-standing dispute with the Vereinigung Cockpit union, which demanded a plan in which pilots can retire at the age of 55 and retain 60% of their pay, which parent Lufthansa insists was not affordable. Germanwings pilots staged a nationwide strike in support of their demands in April 2014, which lasted 3 days. The pilots staged a six-hour strike in September 2014. Simultaneous strikes were staged by Lufthansa pilots.

By the end of 2014, all of Lufthansa&#x27;s national routes and international traffic to and from Germany - except flights to and from Frankfurt and Munich and the routes from Düsseldorf to Newark and Chicago - were transferred to Germanwings. The last route to be transferred was Düsseldorf-Zurich on 8 January 2015.

===Integration into Eurowings from 2015===
In January 2015, Lufthansa Group announced that it would discontinue the &quot;Germanwings&quot; brand and replace it with Eurowings starting in late 2015.

On 25 October 2015, Eurowings took over 55 routes previously operated under the Germanwings brand. The first Germanwings bases to be mostly taken over by Eurowings were Düsseldorf Airport, Hamburg Airport - at both of which Eurowings already operated on behalf of Germanwings - and Cologne Bonn Airport.
Lufthansa announced in October 2015 that Germanwings&#x27; own website would be dissolved and redirected to Eurowings by January 2016 as part of their merger. However, Germanwings continued to operate as a company. From that date, Eurowings became solely responsible for all sales under the Germanwings brand. In January 2016, Germanwings&#x27; social media profiles, such as those on Facebook and YouTube, were renamed Eurowings, while &quot;germanwings.com&quot; was redirected to &quot;eurowings.com&quot;. However, Germanwings continued to operate under its own flight numbers, but used the Eurowings brand.

In December 2016, it was announced that Germanwings would retire 20 aircraft during 2017 without replacement due to Lufthansa&#x27;s new wet-lease deal with Air Berlin which also provided services for Eurowings. It was reported that the Air Berlin aircraft were newer and cheaper to operate than those of Germanwings.

In August 2017, it was announced that Germanwings would abandon its own IATA code &quot;4U&quot; by 25 March 2018. Since then, it has used Eurowings&#x27; &quot;EW&quot; code on for all operations, which are already carried out under the Eurowings brand.

In October 2019, the Pristina base, which had been operated by Germanwings since June 2019, was transferred to Eurowings Europe. In return, Germanwings took over the German base in Munich which had been operated by its sister airline.

On 7 April 2020, Lufthansa announced that it would be shutting down Germanwings, partly due to the large travel ban during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Corporate affairs==
===Service concept===
Germanwings had offered three fare types since 2013. &quot;Basic&quot; was no-frills and offered no inclusive catering and only hand luggage. &quot;Best&quot; included hold baggage, inclusive snacks and drinks as well as access to some lounges for tier members of Miles&amp;More. &quot;Smart&quot; and &quot;Best&quot; more or less corresponded to the Lufthansa service offered on the routes taken over by Germanwings. The fleet was only equipped with economy class.

Germanwings offered &quot;Sky Bistro&quot; (&quot;Bord Shop&quot; in German), a buy on board food and drinks programme. The airline provided an inflight magazine, a bi-monthly German and English magazine called &quot;GW&quot;. While the primary editorial focus was rooted in Germanwings destinations, the content was not exclusively about travel.

Germanwings booking service provided &quot;Blind Booking&quot;, a unique option that allowed passengers to choose one of Germanwings&#x27; base airports, select a category of destination (e.g. Party, Gay-friendly or Culture) and then purchase a round-trip ticket via a random lottery process from among the cities in the category. Such tickets were often priced lower than the corresponding ticket to the same destination, and Germanwings e-mails its customers with details of their destination shortly after the purchase.

===Business trends===
Germanwings had been wholly owned by Lufthansa since 1 January 2009; formal reporting since then had been within the Group Accounts. From 2012, Germanwings figures had been reported only within the &#x27;Lufthansa Passenger Airline Group&#x27;, and have not generally been available separately. The key known trends for Germanwings are shown below (as at year ending 31 December):

In line with Lufthansa&#x27;s declared business strategy, the transfer of European non-hub traffic from Lufthansa Passenger Airlines to Germanwings continued in 2014 and was completed successfully on 7 January 2015. (The increase in 2013 and 2014 figures was due to this intervening transfer of aircraft and routes from Lufthansa.)

==Destinations==
===Codeshare agreements===
Germanwings had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:
* Air Canada
* All Nippon Airways
* Austrian Airlines
* Brussels Airlines
* Lufthansa
* Swiss International Air Lines
* United Airlines
==Fleet==
Germanwings operated the following aircraft:

===Special liveries===
Germanwings used several different special liveries. Some aircraft had special liveries promoting German cities (e.g. the &quot;Bearbus&quot; paint scheme inspired by the coat of arms of Berlin), or as advertisements (e.g. a pink livery for T-Mobile). Those were abandoned during the 2013 rebranding.

==Incidents and accidents==
As of the merger, Germanwings had been involved in one major incident, which resulted in 150 fatalities. On 24 March 2015, an Airbus A320-211 with registration D-AIPX was operating Flight 9525 from Barcelona to Düsseldorf when it crashed in the south of France near Digne-les-Bains, with no survivors. The flight was carrying 144 passengers, two pilots and four cabin crew. German investigators concluded that 27-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had deliberately crashed the plane, while alone in the cockpit. Lubitz took time off from his flight training for several months and informed the Flight Training Pilot School in 2009 of a &quot;previous episode of severe depression&quot;. He later completed the training. Prior to his training as a commercial pilot, he was also treated for suicidal tendencies.

Following the incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) made a recommendation to airlines that two authorized people must be present in the cockpit at all times. In coordination with the German aviation authority, other German airlines and the German aviation industry association, the airlines of the Lufthansa Group implemented a policy requiring this. However, by 2016, the EASA stopped recommending the two-person rule, instead advising airlines to perform a risk assessment and decide for themselves whether to use the rule. Germanwings and other German airlines dropped the rule in 2017.

<text>Hapag-Lloyd Express (previously also marketed as &quot;HLX.com&quot;) was a no-frills, high-frequency, express airline based in Langenhagen, Germany. It operated services within Germany and to destinations in Europe.

On 15 January 2007, it combined its operations with those of Hapag-Lloyd Flug to become TUIfly. While Hapag-Lloyd Flug operated all TUIfly flights, Hapag-Lloyd Express marketed them until TUIfly got its own licence.

== History ==
Hapag-Lloyd Express was established in 2002 and began operations in December 2002 – two months after Germanwings, its direct German competitor at Cologne Bonn. Despite starting its service later and serving fewer routes, HLX gained a higher name recognition and a better reputation through its category-defining campaign &quot;Fly for the price of a taxi&quot;. The airline subsequently won the efficiency award &quot;Effie&quot; in Germany and Europe in recognition of its more effective branding and marketing.

Its main competitors were more established no-frills carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet, as well as other low-cost startups such as Germanwings or Transavia.com, consequently being constantly engaged in a price war with these carriers. In an attempt to win this price war, it expanded rapidly in the first half of 2004, announcing many new routes that it viewed as underserved by other airlines. Examples of such routes include Dublin to Hamburg and Stuttgart, both of which are no longer in operation. In January 2007, Hapag-Lloyd Express and Hapag-Lloyd Flug were merged into the cooperation TUIfly in an attempt to reorganize TUI&#x27;s airline portfolio.

HLX adopted the IATA code of the now defunct Russian Baikal Airlines.

==Services==
Hapag-Lloyd Express offered no-frills services to destinations in Germany and Europe. Most of them are now operated by TUIfly.

==Fleet==
Most of Hapag-Lloyd Express&#x27; aircraft were wet-leased from Hapag-Lloyd Flug.

===Livery===
Hapag-Lloyd Express aircraft were highly recognizable due to their distinctive &quot;New York taxi&quot; style: a checkered black and white line wrapped around a yellow body, aiming to convey the image of quick and cheap point-to-point service.

<doc id="701622" wikidata="Q2719123" url="?curid=701622" title="Umbilicus rupestris">
<text>Umbilicus rupestris, the navelwort, penny-pies or wall pennywort, is a fleshy, perennial, edible flowering plant in the stonecrop family Crassulaceae in the genus &quot;Umbilicus&quot; so named for its umbilicate (navel-like) leaves.

==Etymology==

Both the name &quot;navelwort&quot; and the scientific name &quot;Umbilicus&quot; come from the round shape of the leaves, which have a navel-like depression in the center.

==Description==
Wall pennywort grows to an average of high. The pallid spikes of bell-shaped, greenish-pink flowers of this plant first appear in May, and the green fruits ripen through the summer.

==Distribution==
The plant is found in southern and western Europe, often growing on shady walls or in damp rock crevices that are sparse in other plant growth (thus, &quot;wall&quot; pennywort), where its succulent leaves develop in rosettes.

It is not at present under threat.

==Medicinal usage==

&quot;Umbilicus rupestris&quot; is not the same &quot;Pennywort&quot; as the one used in Asian medicine, which is the unrelated Asiatic Pennywort, &quot;Centella asiatica&quot;.

Navelwort is also assumed to be the &quot;Kidneywort&quot; referred to by Nicholas Culpeper in &quot;The English Physician&quot;, although it may actually refer to the unrelated &quot;Anemone hepatica&quot;. Culpeper used astrology, rather than science, to classify herbs, and as such is not a reliable source. He claimed:
===Properties===
* Vulnerary: The plant is sometimes employed to ease pain on scratches by applying the leaf to the skin after removing the lower cuticle.

<doc id="701636" wikidata="Q4837134" url="?curid=701636" title="Baalath-Beer">
<text>A town named Baalath-Beer is mentioned in the Masoretic Text of Joshua 19:8, which places near the end of a list of towns belonging to the Tribe of Simeon (19:1-9). Where the Masoretic Text reads &quot;Baalath-beer Ramath-negeb&quot;, one version of the Septuagint reads &quot;Baalath as you come to Ramath-negeb.&quot; It is unclear which is the earlier reading. For Ramath-negeb, various biblical translations render the Hebrew &quot;rmt ngb&quot; as &quot;Ramah of the South&quot;, &quot;Ramah in the Negev&quot;, &quot;Ramah of the Negev&quot;, and so on.

Modern archaeologists have not agreed on whether the site of Baalath-Beer can be identified. The existing evidence is ambiguous as to whether or not Baalath-beer is the same town as Ramath-negeb, and Baalath-beer may be the same as the location referred to elsewhere as Baal.

<doc id="701644" wikidata="Q28464386" url="?curid=701644" title="Sainte-Mère-Église">
<text>Sainte-Mère-Église () is a commune in the northwestern French department of Manche, in Normandy. On 1 January 2016, the former communes of Beuzeville-au-Plain, Chef-du-Pont, Écoquenéauville and Foucarville were merged into Sainte-Mère-Église. On 1 January 2019, the former communes of Carquebut and Ravenoville were merged into Sainte-Mère-Église.

==Geography==
Sainte-Mère-Église lies in a flat area of the Cotentin Peninsula known locally as &quot;le Plain&quot; (as opposed to the standard French term &quot;la plaine&quot;). The Plain is bounded on the west by the Merderet River and by the English channel to the east, and by the communes of Valognes and Carentan to the north and south, respectively. Besides Sainte-Mère-Église, the Plain&#x27;s other major town is Montebourg, and its coast includes Utah Beach.

Although most of the Cotentin Peninsula belongs to the Armorican Massif, the Plain is part of the Paris Basin. Argillaceous limestone from the Sinemurian contributes to the region&#x27;s dairy product appellation (AOC) Isigny-Sainte-Mère, which it shares with Bessin.

Horse breeding has long been practiced in the Plain, which is regarded as the cradle of the Anglo-Norman horse breed, the product of English stallions and mares from the Cotendin Peninsula.

==History==
Founded in the eleventh century, the earliest records (1080–1082) include the Latin name &quot;Sancte Marie Ecclesia&quot;, meaning &quot;Church of St. Mary&quot;, while a later document written in the local language, Norman, in 1317 mentions &quot;Saincte Mariglise&quot;. The current French form of the name means &quot;Holy Mother Church&quot;.

The town was involved in the Hundred Years&#x27; War and the Wars of Religion.

===D-Day battle===
The town played a significant part in the World War II Normandy landings because of its position in the middle of route N13, which the Germans would have used to counterattack Allied landings on Utah and Omaha Beaches. In the early morning of 6 June 1944, mixed units of the U.S. 82nd Airborne and U.S. 101st Airborne Divisions occupied the town in Mission Boston, making it one of the first towns liberated in the invasion.

The early airborne landings, at about 1:40 a.m., resulted in heavy casualties. Some buildings in town caught fire that night, illuminating the sky, and making easy targets of the descending men. Some were killed by the fire. Many hanging from trees and utility poles were shot.

A well-known incident involved paratrooper John Steele of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), whose parachute got caught on the tower roof and spire of the town church. He hung there for two hours, pretending to be dead until the Germans took him prisoner. Steele later escaped and rejoined his division when U.S. troops of the 3rd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment attacked the village, capturing 30 Germans and killing 11. The incident was portrayed in the movie &quot;The Longest Day&quot; by actor Red Buttons.
At 5 a.m., a force led by Lieutenant Colonel Edward C. Krause of the 505th PIR took the town with little resistance. Allegedly, the German garrison was confused and had retired for the night. However, heavy German counterattacks began later in the day and into the next. The lightly armed troops held the town until reinforced by tanks from nearby Utah Beach in the afternoon of 7June.

Krause and Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin H. Vandervoort received the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions during the capture of the town. Sgt. George Bowler Tullidge III received the Bronze Star; his parents would distribute &quot;A Paratrooper&#x27;s Faith,&quot; a collection of Tullidge&#x27;s letters home plus Bible verses, throughout the 82nd Airborne until 1995. 2nd Lt. Thomas J. Tighe of the 70th Tank Battalion was killed when his tank was hit by German artillery fire on the morning of June 7; he received the Silver Star posthumously.

Paratrooper Henry Langrehr crashed through a greenhouse roof, as retold in &quot;The Longest Day&quot;. On 6November 2007, he received the Legion of Honour medal from the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy along with five other men.

===Heraldry===
==Population==
==Sights==
Tourism in Sainte-Mère-Église today centres on its role in the D-Day invasion. There are many small museums (such as the Airborne Museum) and World War II-related gift shops and eating places. A dummy paratrooper hangs from the church spire, commemorating the story of John Steele.

Behind the church is a spring, believed by pilgrims to have healing powers, dedicated to Saint Mewan (Saint Méen).

Sainte-Mère-Église is twinned with the English village of Sturminster Marshall in Dorset.

<doc id="701658" wikidata="Q1132616" url="?curid=701658" title="Rome Ciampino Airport">
<text>G. B. Pastine–Rome Ciampino Airport is the secondary international airport serving Rome, the capital of Italy, after Leonardo da Vinci–Rome Fiumicino Airport. It is a joint civilian, commercial and military airport situated south southeast of central Rome, just outside the Greater Ring Road (Italian: &quot;Grande Raccordo Anulare&quot; or &quot;GRA&quot;) the circular motorway around the city.

The airport is a base for two low-cost carriers and general aviation traffic. It also hosts a military airport and the headquarters of the 31º Stormo and the 2nd Reparto Genio of the Italian Air Force. The airport is named after Giovan Battista Pastine, an Italian airship pilot who served in World War I.

==History==
Ciampino Airport was opened in 1916 and is one of the oldest airports still in operation.

From here, on 10 April 1926, Umberto Nobile took off on the airship Norge, the first aircraft to reach the North Pole and the first to fly across the polar ice cap from Europe to America. In October 1930, the first helicopter prototype designed by Corradino D&#x27;Ascanio was tested at Ciampino Airport, reaching a record altitude of , flight time of 8 minutes 45 seconds and distance flown.

During World War II, the airport was captured by Allied forces in June 1944, and afterward became a United States Army Air Forces military airfield. Although primarily used as a transport base by C-47 Skytrain aircraft of the 64th Troop Carrier Group, the Twelfth Air Force 86th Bombardment Group flew A-36 Apache combat aircraft from the airport during the immediate period after its capture from German forces.

When the combat units moved out, Air Transport Command used the airport as a major transshipment hub for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel for the remainder of the war.

It was Rome&#x27;s main airport until 1960, with traffic amounting to over 2 million passengers per year. After the opening of Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, Ciampino handled almost exclusively charter and executive flights for more than three decades. However, the terminal facilities were extended at the beginning of 2007 to accommodate the growing number of low-cost carrier operations.

==Facilities==
===Passenger terminal===
The airport features a single, one-story passenger terminal building containing the departures and arrivals facilities. The departures area consists of a main hall with some stores and service facilities as well as 31 check-in counters and 16 departure gates using walk or bus boarding as there are no jet-bridges. The arrivals area has a separate entrance and features four baggage belts as well as some more service counters.

===Other usage===
The airport hosts a fleet of Bombardier 415 aerial firefighting aircraft. It is also used by express logistics companies such as DHL, by official flights of the Italian Government and by planes of dignitaries visiting the Italian capital. There is also an additional smaller general aviation terminal, although private flights have now mainly been transferred to Rome Urbe Airport.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following passenger airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Ciampino Airport:

==Statistics==
After decades of stagnation in scheduled traffic, low-cost carriers have boosted Ciampino; it is now one of the busiest and fastest growing airports in Italy. Passenger traffic in 2007 was 5,402,000 (9.24% up from 2006; 2006 itself had seen an increase of 16.75% compared to 2005). Traffic has grown so much that noise complaints are now forcing the Italian Ministry of Transport to look for a third airport for Rome, which could take over some part of the excess traffic of Ciampino. Passenger traffic in 2008 was 4,788,931 with a decrease of 11.31% compared to 2007 due to economic crisis and EasyJet gradually moving routes to Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport. In 2014, passenger traffic amounted to 5,018,289, and in 2015 the airport handled 5,834,201 passengers.

==Ground transportation==


=== Private Transfer ===
Private transfer companies offer pre-booked, door-to-door service from Ciampino Airport to destinations in Rome or beyond including popular destinations such as Vatican City or the Colosseum. Bookings are made online, and drivers meet passengers in the arrivals hall with a sign. This option ensures convenience and are available in 24/7.

=== Taxi ===
The Official Taxi are Licensed white taxis (identified by &quot;TAXI&quot; roof signs) are available outside the terminal. Taxis are operate the City of Rome and have a fare rate for a single journey between Ciampino Airport and the area of the City of Rome within the Aurelian Walls (historical central Rome).The journey to central Rome typically takes 30-40 minutes, depending on traffic conditions.

=== Shuttle Buses ===
Shared shuttle buses provide budget-friendly transfers to central Rome, primarily terminating at Termini Station (Rome’s main railway station). Several companies are operate regular service such as Terravision, SIT Bus, and Schiaffini Travel. These buses departures every 30-40 minutes throughout the day.

* Terravision operates buses every 30 minutes to Termini Station, with a travel time of approximately 40 minutes. Tickets cost €6 one-way and can be purchased online or onboard.

* SIT Bus Shuttle offers routes to Termini Station and stops near Vatican City, with fares starting at €7 one-way.
* Schiaffini Travel provides services to Tiburtina Station in eastern Rome for €5 one-way.

=== Public Transport ===
Public transport provides a cost-effective way to travel between Ciampino Airport and Rome. But from the Ciampino does not have a direct train or metro connection, so travelers can use a combination of bus and train or bus and metro services to reach the city center.

* Bus + Train: Traveler can take local bus (Atral bus) from Ciampino Airport to Ciampino Railway Station. From there, regional trains run to Rome Termini Station take approximately 15 minutes.

* Bus + Metro: Another public transport option is to take a bus from Ciampino Airport to Anagnina Metro Station, which is the terminus of Metro Line A. Buses such as ATRAL and COTRAL operate on this route, with a travel time of about 20 minutes. The Ciampino station is served by the FL4 and FL6 lines of the Lazio regional railways, which both travel to Rome Termini Station and to the main railway destinations in Lazio. From Anagnina, passengers can take the metro to various parts of Rome, including the city center.

==Accidents and incidents==
* Defects in the design of the de Havilland Comet jet airliner were discovered as the result of inflight breakups on two Comets that departed from Ciampino:
** On 10 January 1954, BOAC Flight 781, a de Havilland Comet, broke up in mid air and crashed into the Mediterranean twenty minutes after takeoff from Ciampino Airport, en route to London Heathrow Airport.
** On 8 April 1954, two weeks after Comets were allowed to resume flying following a temporary grounding resulting from the previous crash, South African Airways Flight 201, another Comet, broke up shortly after takeoff and crashed not far from Ponza.
* On 21 December 1959, Vickers Viscount I-LIZT of Alitalia crashed short of the runway on a training flight exercise in landing with two engines inoperative. Both people on board were killed.
* On 10 November 2008, Ryanair Flight 4102 from Hahn suffered damage during landing. The cause of the accident was stated to be birdstrikes affecting both engines. The port undercarriage of the Boeing 737-8AS collapsed. The aircraft involved was Boeing 737-8AS EI-DYG, delivered new to Ryanair from Boeing. There were 6 crew and 166 passengers on board. The airport was closed for over 24 hours as a result of the accident. Two crew and eight passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries. As well as damage to the engines and undercarriage, the rear fuselage was also damaged by contact with the runway. The final report of the accident, investigated by ANSV (National Agency for the Safety of Flights) was released on 20 December 2018, more than 10 years after the accident.

<doc id="701659" wikidata="Q2096472" url="?curid=701659" title="Teatro Regio (Parma)">
<text>Teatro Regio di Parma, originally constructed as the Nuovo Teatro Ducale (New Ducal Theatre), is an opera house and opera company in Parma, Italy.

Replacing an obsolete house, the new Ducale achieved prominence in the years after 1829, and especially so after the composer Giuseppe Verdi, who was born near Busseto, some thirty kilometres away, had achieved fame. Also well known in Parma was the conductor Arturo Toscanini, born there in 1867.

As has been noted by Lee Marshall, &quot;while not as well known as La Scala in Milan or La Fenice in Venice, the city’s Teatro Regio...is considered by opera buffs to be one of the true homes of the great Italian tradition, and the well-informed audience is famous for giving voice to its approval or disapproval – not just from the gallery.&quot;

The 1,400-seat auditorium, with four tiers of boxes topped by a gallery, was inaugurated on 16 May 1829 when it presented the premiere of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Zaira&quot;, a production which was staged another seven times, although it did not prove to be popular with the Parma audiences. Initially Rossini had been invited to compose a work for the inauguration of the house, but he was too busy and so the task fell to Bellini. However, that inaugural season saw three Rossini operas staged, including &quot;Moïse et Pharaon&quot;, &quot;Semiramide&quot;, and &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;.

Today, the company stages about four operas each season from mid January to April and, since 2003, it has presented an annual Verdi Festival each October.

==Construction of the Teatro Ducale==

There had been a Ducal Theatre in Parma since the 17th century, the principal one being the Teatro Farnese constructed in 1618, but it was used only nine times, the last one occurring in October 1732, after which it suffered from years from neglect and further damage by American bombing in World War II. It was rebuilt in 1966.

However, the &quot;Nuovo&quot; replaced another existing &quot;small and narrow&quot; Ducal Theatre dating from 1688, which had been located in the Palazzo di Riserva. The 1,200-seat theatre was becoming obsolete due to a variety of factors, including the need to appeal to an increasing middle class desire to experience opera, but also allow for &quot;separate and well articulated private and public spaces&quot;. After a performance of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Zelmira&quot; in 1828, it was closed and then demolished.

The newly built &quot;Nuovo Ducale&quot; was located on the site of the former Monastery of St. Alexander and it was located next to the Ducal Palace. Construction began in 1821 during the reign of Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma who, as Napoleon I&#x27;s divorced second wife, preferred divorce rather than exile. She settled in Parma, ruling from 1816 to 1847, and under her patronage and financial support, secured the services of the architect Nicola Bettoli. Marie Louise oversaw the construction, assuring that the interior decoration reflected &quot;the sobriety of neoclassicism and the colours white and light blue&quot;.

In 1849, restoration was called for and then, four years later under the Bourbon Duke Carlo III, more opulent decoration took place. This included the replacement of the neoclassical elements with the more sensual aspects of the mid-19th century; as Martini notes, &quot;this rendered the theatre more splendid with extensive use of red velvet and golden ornamentation. In addition, gas lighting in the house was installed. By 1907, the stage lighting was electrified, and that of the rest of house took place during the centennial of Verdi&#x27;s birth in 1913.
The architecture of the &quot;Nuovo&quot;

The façade of the theatre was built in the neoclassical style, which has remained unchanged over the years. With a colonnade of ten Ionic granitic columns at the base, which created an arcade, this supports five imperial-style windows above, topped by a tympana and decorative elements enrich the highest part of the facade with one central semi-circular window, besides bas-reliefs by Tommaso Bandini of two muses at one lyra in the central and lateral position.

The foyer is, as Martini describes it, a &quot;large square upheld by four pairs of imposing mottled marble Ionic columns on an attic base... The entire room is based on the square and on symmetry&quot;. It is decorated with a marble floor.

After the 1853 restoration, which overall has been described as neo-Baroque (&quot;[It radiat[es] gold, ivory, and maroon&quot; colours), the ceiling of the auditorium was decorated by Giovan Battista Borghesi with frescoes of the most famous playwrights. This remains today. The chandelier, which was built in Paris and taken to Parma in 1854 when the theatre was adapted for gas, is 4.5 metres in height and weighs 1100 kg.

Renaming the theatre

After the reign of Duchess Marie Louise, the theatre was renamed and between 1849 and 1860, it was known as the &quot;Teatro Reale&quot;. With the unification of Italy in 1861, the house took its present name, the Teatro Regio.

==Verdi and the Teatro Regio==

Verdi, who was born and who grew up only 20 miles from Parma, was perhaps quite naturally soon adopted by the city as its native son, especially as his fame grew after the success of the 1840 &quot;Nabucco&quot;. His operas have had a special place in the Regio&#x27;s programming after 17 April 1843, when Verdi came to direct his &quot;Nabucco&quot;. Since that time, the Regio has staged every one of his operas, including adaptations of original versions such as &quot;I Lombardi&quot; of 1843, which became &quot;Jérusalem&quot; for Paris in 1847 or the 1847 &quot;Macbeth&quot; which was revised in 1865.

The seasons surrounding the centennial of his birth in 1813 and the 50th anniversary of his death in 1951 were devoted solely to his operas, and between 1829 and 1979, Verdi, Donizetti, and Bellini were the most frequently staged composers, with Verdi topping the list with five of his operas, the most frequent of which was &quot;Aida&quot; with 177 performances over the 150-year period. The 2001 centennial of the composer&#x27;s death resulted in a year-long celebration beginning with the &quot;Requiem&quot; and including six operas.

The &quot;bicententario&quot; year of 2013 prompted special celebrations which included concerts by the La Scala Orchestra, under Riccardo Chailly, and the Orchestre National de France under Daniele Gatti (which also gave the Requiem). Providing insights into working with the Teatro and with Verdi&#x27;s music were singers Carlo Bergonzi, Mirella Freni, and Raina Kabaivanska as well as conductor Bruno Bartoletti. A concert by the Filarmonica Arturo Toscanini on 10 October was something of a highlight of the celebrations. It included a concert version of act 2 of &quot;Aida&quot;. Other complete operas given during the month included &quot;I masnadieri&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, and &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;.

Festival Verdi

In addition to its regular season, from the 1990s the company began to mount a Festival Verdi. Beginning in 2003, the celebration known as &quot;Buon Compleanno Maestro Verdi&quot; (&quot;Happy Birthday, Maestro Verdi&quot;) has been held each 10 October with a concert of excerpts from his works and this is coupled with the month-long festival.

Along with the Verdi operas presented as part of its regular season since 2003/04, the aim of the Festival Verdi has been to present every one of the composer&#x27;s operas by the bi-centennial year of 2013. However, while this was not achieved, very few operas remain to be staged (depending upon whether different versions are planned). The Festival has included associated discussions, orchestral concerts, and other relevant presentations.

==The Teatro Regio&#x27;s audience==
Several writers have commented on the particular qualities of certain members of the audience when attending a performance at the Ducale and the Regio: &quot;Parma&#x27;s operatic public has a reputation as particularly demanding [and] famous for being unforgiving of any singer not in good voice&quot; notes Plantamura, while Lynn goes back to the early days of the old Ducale in 1816 with an account of the way the tenor Alberico Curioni was &quot;whistled and booed, but he would have none of it and shouted obscenities back&quot; until the police were called and arrested him. The inaugural gala of the Teatro Regio on 16 May 1829 &quot;was not a joyous occasion&quot; for the audience, which gave Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Zaira&quot; &quot;a frosty reception&quot; due to the fact that he was the second choice and that he had refused to use a libretto written by one of the company&#x27;s board members.

Lynn also recounts several incidents during performances in the 19th century where the curtain was brought down due to vociferous protests from audience members, one event actually leading to the dismissal of the theatre&#x27;s administration. A 21st century performance, which incited audience displeasure was the 2001 opening of a controversial production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which was set during the First World War. A later performance caused competing &quot;bravas&quot; and booing for and against the Lady Macbeth. The theatre&#x27;s administration explained it as follows: &quot;Teatro Regio realizes that it needs to be the best because the audience are all experts&quot;.

==Some artists who have worked at the Teatro Regio di Parma==
The dates of their most recent appearances have been noted below.

==In popular culture==
The Teatro Regio was featured in scenes in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Before the Revolution&quot;, as well as the 1987 Italian horror film &quot;Opera&quot;, directed by Dario Argento.

<doc id="701664" wikidata="Q121771" url="?curid=701664" title="C.A.I. Second">
<text>C.A.I. Second S.p.A. was an Italian airline operating flights for its parent company, Alitalia. When Alitalia merged with Air One, it didn&#x27;t close C.A.I. (at that time known as Volare S.p.A. and then Volareweb.com) so that it could preserve slots at Milan Linate Airport.

It was once a low-cost subsidiary of the old Alitalia-LAI. Its head office was located in &quot;Area Tecnica Sud&quot; of Terminal 1 of Milan Malpensa Airport, in Ferno, Varese, Italy, and it ceased activity with this name on 12 January 2009. The airline was then used to operate Alitalia flights from Linate Airport as C.A.I. Second. This name was only a legal one and not used in public; all of its flights were branded as &quot;Alitalia&quot;. The airline ceased operations and was merged into Alitalia mainline by February 2015.

== History ==

===Early years===
At one time the airline (Volare Group) operated flights from Italy to Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Romania and London Luton Airport. The airline suspended its operations in November 2004 and filed for bankruptcy. The tickets on suspended flights were never refunded to passengers. Since then, the airline exited bankruptcy and, for a period, only operated Italian domestic routes.

By May 2008, Volare flew to 20 destinations in Europe. Volare&#x27;s charter and leisure subsidiary Air Europe flew to other long-haul destinations. With the fusion of Alitalia-CAI and Air One later on that year, however, Air Europe was discontinued.

===New ownership===
After bankruptcy, the Volare Group was put up for sale by the Italian Government in December 2004. Alitalia-LAI&#x27;s offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid, however Air One tried to block the sale by going to court. On 14 April 2006 Volare S.p.A. was founded. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).

Volare Group had its head office in Thiene, Italy and its commercial management and charter management in Milan. Alitalia&#x27;s offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare S.p.A. In Italy, the sale of Volare is considered a soap-opera due to the multiple obstacles placed on the sale of the airline to Alitalia-LAI.

As of 1 January 2008, Volareweb was an integral part of Alitalia-LAI and was serving as the company&#x27;s Italian low-cost subsidiary. Furthermore, due to Alitalia-LAI&#x27;s hub switch from Milan-Malpensa to Rome-Fiumicino, several flights from Malpensa were discontinued (such as Kraków and Timișoara) and transferred to Volare. With the Alitalia-CAI-Air One fusion, these flights ceased to exist. Nowadays from Milan Malpensa Alitalia-CAI has adopted Air One as a subsidiary for low-fare flights. Only one Airbus A320 coming from parent Alitalia-CAI remained in the fleet (EI-IKB) to preserve the slots.

On 11 February 2015, the airline was dissolved and its operations integrated into Alitalia mainline.

== Destinations ==

===Last operations===
Volare Airlines code &quot;VE&quot; was used on some Alitalia flights from Milan Linate Airport (in this way, Alitalia can operate more flights than it would have been able to using a single airline, as there is a limit to the operations at Linate airport for airlines). C.A.I. First was used for the same purpose.

<text>The Westmeath Examiner is a weekly newspaper in County Westmeath, Ireland. It was founded in 1882.

The &quot;Westmeath Examiner&quot; is a sister paper of the &quot;Westmeath Independent&quot; which circulates in the Athlone area of the county. The &quot;Westmeath Examiner&quot; circulates in the north of the county and is based in Mullingar, the county town of County Westmeath. In May 2004, both papers were sold by their owners Martin Nally and Ronald Carroll to Celtic Media Group - a subsidiary of the Scottish owned Dunfermline Press - along with the third sister paper &quot;Offaly Independent&quot;. On 16 May 2015, &quot;The Westmeath Examiner&quot; saw a change from broadsheet to compact format.

In June 2012, the Irish management team of Celtic Media Group acquired the business and assets of the group for €5.5 million.

Other Irish newspaper titles that are part of the same stable include &quot;The Anglo Celt&quot;, in Cavan; The &quot;Meath Chronicle&quot; in Navan; and, since May 2014, &quot;The Connaught Telegraph&quot;.

According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the paper had an average weekly circulation of 9,687 during the first six months of 2006.
For the same period in 2011, it had an average weekly circulation of 5,719, a fall that was in line with industry trends, which, broadly, endured sudden sharp declines in paid-for sales. However, following a move from a Wednesday publication date to a Tuesday, and a change to its digital offering, the newspaper saw renewed growth in paid-for sales.

<text>Celtic Media Group provides publishing, printing and pre-press (graphic design) services to the Irish newspaper sector. It also has a digital consultancy service.

==History==
Previously owned by the Scottish media firm, Dunfermline Press Group, the Celtic Media Group is owned by its Irish management team, following a management buy-out which was completed in 2012. 

Celtic Media expanded following the acquisition of the Connaught Telegraph in 2014 and its co-ownership of Dublin People Group, publisher of Northside People &amp; Southside People, acquired in 2018.

The group&#x27;s publishing titles – among them Meath Chronicle; Anglo Celt; Westmeath Examiner – were the subject of an acquisition bid by Independent News &amp; Media (INM) in late 2016 which was approved by the Competition &amp; Consumer Protection Commission and the Department of Communications. However, both parties opted not to proceed with the acquisition due to the level of undertakings around employment levels required by the regulatory process.

The print company, operated by Celtic in Navan, was restructured in October 2019 with the loss of 16 jobs and the cessation of its long-standing Trinity Mirror contract. Two print contracts were subsequently secured – the Northern Standard newspaper and the Racing Post Weekender title – with the Navan plant operating on a lower cost base.

The group won three of the 12 overall awards and received 11 nominations in the 2020 Local Ireland Media Awards.

In July 2020, the Southside People and Northside People titles were restructured under a new owner. Celtic continued to provide pre-press and print services to the Dublin People titles.

Frank Mulrennan, CEO of Celtic and representing the Local Ireland industry body, told the Oireachtas Committee on Media (December 2020) that the country&#x27;s 46 weekly local newspapers publish &quot;vital, trusted, and needed public information&quot; but are facing major challenges. He said: &quot;In reality, our industry is still badly impacted by the last recession and the digital dominance of the likes of Facebook and Google.&quot;

In 2021, the print plant announced the renewal of its contract to print the Racing Post daily newspaper and three weekly titles for five years.

<text>Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt was a small historic state in present-day Thuringia, Germany, with its capital at Rudolstadt.

==History==
Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt was established in 1599 in the course of a resettlement of Schwarzburg dynasty lands. Since the 11th century, the ancestral seat of the comital family had been at Schwarzburg Castle, though after 1340, for most of its existence as a polity had the capital at the larger town of Rudolstadt. In 1583 Count Günther XLI of Schwarzburg, the eldest son of Günther XL the Rich and ruler over the united Schwarzburg lands, had died without issue. He was succeeded by his younger brothers, whereby Albert VII received the territory around Rudolstadt. After their brother William I, Count of Schwarzburg-Frankenhausen had died in 1597, the surviving brothers Albert VII and John Günther I established the two counties of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen by the 1599 Treaty of Stadtilm.

Albert&#x27;s descendants ruled as sovereign counts of the Holy Roman Empire. Count Albert Anton (1662–1710) was elevated to the rank of a prince by Emperor Leopold I; it was however his son Louis Frederick I (1710–1718) who first bore the princely title, whereby Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt in 1711 became a principality under the same entity. It withstood mediatisation and after the empire&#x27;s dissolution joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1807 and the German Confederation in 1815.

In 1905 Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt had an area of and a population of 97,000.

On 23 November 1918, during the German Revolution of 1918–1919 and the fall of all the German monarchies, Prince Günther Victor was the last to abdicate. The former principality became a &quot;Free State&quot; in 1919 and joined the Weimar Republic as a constituent state. In 1920, it joined with other small states in the area to form the new state of Thuringia.

<text>Somerset Island (Inuktitut &quot;Kuuganajuk&quot;) is a large, uninhabited island of the Arctic Archipelago, that is part of the Canadian territory of Nunavut. The island is separated from Cornwallis Island and Devon Island to the north by the Parry Channel, from Baffin Island to the east by Prince Regent Inlet, from the Boothia Peninsula to the south by Bellot Strait, and from Prince of Wales Island to the west by Peel Sound. It has an area of , making it the 46th largest island in the world and Canada&#x27;s twelfth largest island.

The majority of the island lies in the Qikiqtaaluk Region and is home to the summer Arctic Watch Lodge. A small southern portion lies in the Kitikmeot Region and is the site of the former Fort Ross trading post.

==History==
Around 1000 AD, the north coast of Somerset Island was inhabited by the Thule people, as evidenced by whale bones, tunnels and stone ruins.

William Edward Parry was the first documented European to sight the island in 1819.

HMS &quot;Fury&quot; was an Arctic exploration ship commanded by Henry Parkyns Hoppner. She was damaged by ice while overwintering and was abandoned on 25 August 1825, at what has since been called Fury Beach on Somerset Island. Her stores were unloaded onto the beach and later came to the rescue of John Ross, who travelled overland to the abandoned cache when he lost his ship further south in the Gulf of Boothia on his 1829 expedition.

James Clark Ross was the nephew of John Ross, and accompanied him on the 1829 expedition. In late 1848, James Clark Ross returned to Somerset Island by landing two ships at Port Leopold on the northeast coast to winter. In April the following year, he launched an exploration of the island by sledge.

Roald Amundsen transited the passage between the Island and the Prince of Wales Island in the &quot;Gjøa&quot; in the first successful traverse of the Northwest Passage in 1904. Henry Larsen transited the passage, in the &quot;St Roch&quot; in the second successful transit in 1943. But he found this route was dangerously icebound, and also too shallow for commercial travel.

The Fort Ross trading post was established and run by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at the southeastern end of the island from 1937 to 1948. When it was closed, the island was left uninhabited except for occasional use of the former store and manager&#x27;s house as shelters by Inuit caribou hunters from Taloyoak, and a small settlement at Creswell Bay, which after 1967 consisted solely of the family of Timothy Idlout and Naomi Nangat. The Idlout family left Somerset Island in 1991, leaving it completely uninhabited. In 2006, CBC&#x27;s &quot;The National&quot; included Fort Ross in a special series focused on climate change.

==Tourism==
Arctic Watch Lodge, a tourism establishment built in 1992, is located on Somerset Island. Arctic Watch was established at Cunningham Inlet because of the large number of beluga whales that congregate there in the summer. Arctic Watch Lodge is operated by Richard Weber and Josée Auclair. There is a private airstrip at the site, Arctic Watch Lodge Aerodrome.

<text>Judith Krantz (née Tarcher; January 9, 1928 – June 22, 2019) was an American magazine writer, fashion editor, and novelist. Her first novel &quot;Scruples&quot; (1978) was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller and was translated into 50 languages. &quot;Scruples&quot;, which describes the glamorous and affluent world of high fashion in Beverly Hills, California, helped define a new sub-genre of the romance novel - the bonkbuster or &quot;sex-and-shopping&quot; novel. She also became a &quot;celebrity author&quot; through her extensive touring and promotion. Her later books included &quot;Princess Daisy&quot; (1980), Mistral&#x27;s Daughter (1982)&quot; Till We Meet Again&quot; (1988), &quot;Dazzle&quot; (1990), and &quot;Spring Collection&quot; (1996). Her autobiography, &quot;Sex and Shopping: The Confessions of a Nice Jewish Girl&quot;, was published in 2000.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Judith Bluma-Gittel Tarcher was born on January 9, 1928, in New York City, the daughter of Mary (Braeger), a Lithuanian-born attorney, and Jack D. Tarcher, an advertising executive. Her family was Jewish. The &quot;youngest, smartest, and shortest girl&quot; in her year, she graduated from the Birch Wathen School at age 16. Krantz then enrolled at Wellesley College.

Krantz told &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 1982 that she attended Wellesley with three goals: to date, to read every novel in the library, and to graduate. &quot;Torchy&quot;, as her dormmates named her, held the dorm dating record as the only one to have 13 consecutive dates with 13 different men. Her grades were not as impressive as her extracurricular activities. Krantz earned one A-plus in English, but had a B− average in her major and C average in everything else. Krantz had the opportunity to improve her marks when she took a short-story class during her sophomore year. Although the professor enjoyed her writing, he refused to give her an A because she had poor spelling, and he thought the B would teach her a lesson. Krantz claims to have learned the lesson well—she did not write fiction again for 31 years.

After graduating from Wellesley in 1948, Krantz moved to Paris, where she worked in fashion public relations. She enjoyed attending elegant parties, borrowing couture gowns, and meeting prominent people such as Marlene Dietrich, Orson Welles and Hubert de Givenchy.

====Magazines====
The following year, Krantz returned to New York City, where began a career in magazine journalism. She worked in the fiction department at &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; before being promoted to fashion editor and having the opportunity to write several articles for the magazine.

In 1953 Krantz attended a Fourth of July party hosted by her high school friend, Barbara Walters. There she met the future film and television producer Steve Krantz. The two were married the following year, on February 19, 1954. Three years later, she gave birth to their first son, and she gave up her full-time job, choosing instead to write part-time from home. She wrote many freelance articles for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, and &quot;Cosmopolitan.&quot; Her best-known article was &quot;The Myth of the Multiple Orgasm&quot;, which was published in &quot;Cosmopolitan.&quot; Her magazine career gave Krantz an opportunity to interview many prominent women.

===Novels===
In 1976, Krantz&#x27;s husband decided to take flying lessons. Despite Krantz having a fear of flying, she joined the flying lessons with him, after which her fears were subdued. Subsequently, she wrote fiction for the first time since college. Although her husband had been insisting for years that she was a natural storyteller, Krantz believed that she was writing the book simply to prove to him that she was not able to write good fiction.

She completed her first novel, &quot;Scruples&quot;, nine months later. The year it was published, 1978, Krantz turned 50. The books were not copyrighted under her own name but by Steve Krantz Productions. &quot;Scruples&quot; reached the number one spot on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list. There were two sequels: &quot;Scruples Two&quot; (1992) and &quot;Lovers&quot; (1994).

Her second novel, &quot;Princess Daisy&quot;, followed in 1980 and netted her $5 million before its publication. It also became a number one best seller, with the paperback rights selling for a then-record $3.2 million. It concerns the fabulously wealthy and glamorous Daisy, daughter of a Russian prince, who has to confront and overcome many harsh realities. The book is notable for having received one of the most scathing reviews ever written, by Clive James. Krantz continued her run of success with &quot;Mistral&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1982) (a multi-generational saga) and &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot; (1986), (about writer and socialite Maxi Amberville, a thinly disguised portrait of the author). Mistral&#x27;s Daughter went beyond the formula (with only four sex scenes, all at the beginning of the book), delving into women&#x27;s empowerment, art, Jewish spirituality, and the persecution of Jewish people in France during World War II. &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot; (1988) which starts in the music halls of 1910s Paris and continues on until after the Second World War, was the last to make the annual top ten bestseller lists, though the later novels continued to be popular.

&quot;Spring Collection&quot; (1996) returns to the world of fashion, while &quot;The Jewels of Tessa Kent&quot; (1998) explores mother-daughter relationships; Krantz reportedly had a difficult relationship with her own mother. She retired from writing that year at the age of 70, saying she had nothing left to say to her readers. Over 80 million copies of her books are in print in over 50 languages. Seven of her novels have also been adapted for television (as either films or mini-series), with her husband having served as executive producer for some of them. She also wrote one original mini-series for television, &quot;Judith Krantz&#x27;s &quot;Secrets&quot;&quot;, in 1992.

===Family===
Krantz served on the advisory board of Compassion &amp; Choices, an organization dedicated to providing choices for the dying. In 2006, she joined the Board of the Los Angeles Music Center.

Krantz&#x27;s husband, Steve Krantz, died in 2007 of pneumonia. The couple had two sons, Tony Krantz and Nicholas Krantz, both of whom reside in the Los Angeles area. Krantz was the sister-in-law of children&#x27;s entertainer and television host Shari Lewis, who was married to Krantz&#x27;s brother, Jeremy P. Tarcher, publisher of nonfiction books on health, psychology and New Age spirituality. Jeremy&#x27;s daughter, Krantz&#x27;s niece, is entertainer Mallory Lewis.

===Death===
Krantz died on June 22, 2019, at her home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.

<text>Grūtas Park (; also unofficially known as Stalin&#x27;s World) is a socialist realism museum with a sculpture garden of Soviet-era statues and other Soviet ideological relics from the times of the Soviet occupation. Founded in 2001 by a local businessman Viliumas Malinauskas, the park is located near Druskininkai, about southwest of Vilnius, Lithuania. The park requires an entrance fee.

== History ==
After Lithuania restored its independence in 1990, the vast majority of the Soviet statues were taken down and dumped in different places. Malinauskas asked Lithuanian authorities to grant him possession of the sculptures, so that he could build a privately financed museum. This Soviet-theme park was created in the wetlands of the Dzūkija National Park. Many of its features are re-creations of Soviet Gulag prison camps: wooden paths, guard towers, and barbed-wire fences.

Its establishment was controversial and faced considerable opposition at the time. Some ideas originally meant to be a part of the park were never allowed. Examples include transporting the visitors in a Gulag-style train. Grūtas Park and its founder Malinauskas won the 2001 Ig Nobel Peace Prize. Since January 2007 the park has been in dispute with the Lithuanian copyright protection agency. The agency requires royalties to be paid to seven Lithuanian artists who created some of the statues.

The park also contains playgrounds, a mini-zoo and cafes, all containing relics of the Soviet era. On special occasions actors stage re-enactments of various Soviet-sponsored festivals.

== Exposition ==

The exposition, consisting of 86 statues by 46 different sculptors, is organized into spheres. Each of the statues features a Soviet or socialist activist, many of them ethnic Lithuanians. The Totalitarian Sphere features sculptures of the main Communist leaders and thinkers, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Karl Marx. The Terror Sphere is dedicated to sculptures of founders of the Communist Party of Lithuania (Zigmas Aleksa-Angarietis, Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas) and officers of the Red Army (Feliksas Baltušis-Žemaitis, Ieronim Uborevich). It also has a sculpture of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the organizer of the Red Terror.

The Soviet Sphere includes sculptures of the four leaders of Lithuanian Communists, executed in the aftermath of the 1926 Lithuanian coup d&#x27;état, and activists of the Lithuanian–Soviet War of 1918–1919. The Red Sphere is dedicated to Soviet partisans, including Marytė Melnikaitė. The Occupation and Death Spheres showcase the brutal side the Soviet regime, including mass deportations and suppression of the Lithuanian partisans. The 20 hectares of the park area is reminiscent of severe Siberia conditions with its guard towers, fragments of concentration camps and other elements of Soviet repression.

According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;As countries grapple with their unsavoury pasts and consider the rightful place of their controversial monuments, the park offers an alternative model to museums or destruction.&quot;

<text>A fifth-generation programming language (5GL) is a high-level programming language based on problem-solving using constraints given to the program, rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer. Most constraint-based and logic programming languages and some other declarative languages are fifth-generation languages.

==History==
While fourth-generation programming languages are designed to build specific programs, fifth-generation languages are designed to make the computer solve a given problem without the programmer. This way, the user only needs to worry about what problems need to be solved and what conditions need to be met, without worrying about how to implement a routine or algorithm to solve them. Fifth-generation languages are used mainly in artificial intelligence research. OPS5 and Mercury are examples of fifth-generation languages, as is ICAD, which was built upon Lisp. KL-ONE is an example of a related idea, a frame language.

In the 1980s, fifth-generation languages were considered to be the way of the future, and some predicted that they would replace procedural programming with constraint based programming for all tasks that could be framed as a series of logical constraints. Most notably, from 1982 to 1993, Japan put much research and money into their fifth-generation computer systems project, hoping to design a massive computer network of machines using these tools.

However, as larger programs were built, the flaws of the approach became more apparent. It turns out that, given a set of constraints defining a particular problem, deriving an efficient algorithm to solve it is a very difficult problem in itself. This crucial step cannot yet be automated and still requires the insight of a human programmer.

==Common misconception==
Vendors have been known on occasion to advertise their languages as 5GL. Most of the time they actually sell 4GLs with a higher level of automation and knowledge base. Because the hype of the 1980s faded away and the projects were eventually all dropped, 5GL awareness has also dropped; this has opened doors to the vendors to reuse the term in marketing their new tools, without causing much controversy among the current generations of programmers.

<doc id="701691" wikidata="Q183202" url="?curid=701691" title="Teatro Regio (Turin)">
<text>The Teatro Regio (Royal Theatre) is a prominent opera house and opera company in Turin, Piedmont, Italy. Its season runs from October to June with the presentation of eight or nine operas given from five to twelve performances of each.

Several buildings provided venues for operatic productions in Turin from the mid-16th century, but it was not until 1713 that a proper opera house was considered, and under the architect Filippo Juvarra planning began. However, the cornerstone was not laid until the reign of Charles Emmanuel III in 1738 after Juvarra&#x27;s death. The work was supervised by Benedetto Alfieri until the theatre was completed and decorated by Bernardino Galliari.

Puccini premiered his &quot;La Bohème&quot; in 1896 in the Teatro Regio.

==Teatro Regio, 1740 to 1936==
The Teatro Regio (Royal Theatre) was inaugurated on 26 December 1740 with Francesco Feo&#x27;s &quot;Arsace&quot;. It was a sumptuously built facility, seating 1,500 and with 139 boxes located on five tiers plus a gallery.

However, the theatre was closed on royal order in 1792 and it became a warehouse. With the French occupation of Turin during the Napoleonic War the theatre was renamed the &quot;Teatro Nazionale&quot; and finally, after Napoleon&#x27;s ascent to Emperor, renamed again as the &quot;Teatro Imperiale&quot;. Napoleon&#x27;s fall in 1814 saw the theatre returned to its original name, the &quot;Regio&quot;. In the following years the opera house went through several periods of financial crisis and it was taken over by the city in 1870.

Other theatres were built and presented seasons of opera in Turin. Among them was the restored Teatro Carignano in 1824. It too was acquired by the municipality in 1932 and, after the destruction by fire of the Teatro Regio in 1936, the Carignano was to serve as the main venue for opera in the city until the Regio reopened in 1973.

Even before it burnt down, discussions about whether to rebuild the Regio or create a brand new theatre preoccupied Turin in the early twentieth century. Two plans were presented and the one selected expanded the seating capacity to 2,415 by removing the fourth and fifth levels of boxes and creating a huge amphitheatre. Work was completed in 1905 but the theatre closed during the First World War and re-opened in 1919. Until February 1936, seasons of opera were presented until fire destroyed all but the facade of the Teatro Regio. It remained closed for thirty-seven years. Arturo Toscanini was the conductor of the Turin Opera from 1895 to 1898, during which time several productions of the works of Wagner were given Italian premieres.

==Rebuilt Teatro Regio after 1973==

Following the fire, a national competition was launched to find an architect. However, with the war and the overall financial situation, the foundation stone was not laid until 25 September 1963. Even then, work did not start until September 1967 under architect Carlo Mollino.

The rebuilt theatre, with its striking contemporary interior design but hidden behind the original facade, was inaugurated on 10 April 1973 with a production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I vespri siciliani&quot; directed by Maria Callas and Giuseppe Di Stefano.

The new house seats 1,750 and is elliptical in shape with a large orchestra level and 37 boxes around its perimeter. An acoustic shell was added to improve its sound.

The house presents a wide range of operas during its seasons, including contemporary works, although in the first years of the new century financial pressures have made the programming somewhat more conservative and favoring more 19th-century operas.

==Facade==
The building&#x27;s outer facade is made from brick with a unique brickwork pattern using custom cut bricks to create a relief of stars which seems to overlap itself continuously like the scales of a fish. This is an illusion created by the uniquely designed masonry pattern as the wall is actually straight. The shadows created by the protruding parts enforce this illusion and the complex pattern reinforces this illusion.

The facade of the Teatro Regio is one of the Piedmontese buildings that are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<text>British royal residences are palaces, castles and houses which are occupied by members of the British royal family in the United Kingdom. The current residences are owned by the Crown, by the Duchy of Cornwall, and privately by members of the royal family; all the official residences are owned by the Crown. Some official residences, such as the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Hillsborough Castle, serve primarily ceremonial functions and are rarely used residentially. 

The occupied royal residences are cared for and maintained by the Property Section of the Royal Households of the United Kingdom. Public opening is overseen by the Royal Collection Trust. The unoccupied royal palaces of England, along with Hillsborough Castle, are the responsibility of Historic Royal Palaces.

Unlike the other nations of the United Kingdom, there is no official residence for a member of the royal family in Wales; Llwynywermod is the private Welsh residence of the Prince of Wales.

<doc id="701727" wikidata="Q935171" url="?curid=701727" title="Semi-acoustic guitar">
<text>A semi-acoustic guitar, also known as a hollow-body electric guitar, is a type of electric guitar designed to be played with a guitar amplifier featuring a fully or partly hollow body and at least one electromagnetic pickup. First created in the 1930s, they became popular in jazz and blues, where they remain widely used, and the early period of rock &amp; roll, though they were later largely supplanted by solid-body electric guitars in rock. 

They differ from an acoustic-electric guitar, which is an acoustic guitar that has been fitted with some means of amplification to increase volume without changing the instrument&#x27;s tone.

==Types==
Semi-acoustic guitars may have a fully hollow body, making them essentially archtop acoustics with the pickups permanently mounted into the sound board, such as the Gibson ES-175. Some models feature bodies the full width of acoustics, allowing them to be played fully acoustically, while others, such as the Epiphone Casino, have &quot;thinline&quot; bodies where the hollow body serves purely to alter the tone, not increase the acoustic volume.

Other semi-acoustic guitars have a solid center block running the length and depth of the body, called a &quot;semi-hollow body&quot;. Examples include models that feature sound holes, like the Gibson ES-335, and ones with no sound holes but hollow interior chambers, like the Gretsch Duo-Jet. In these, the bridge is fixed to a solid block of wood rather than to a sound board, and the belly vibration is minimized much as in a solid body instrument. The addition of the central block helps to manage feedback and allows the guitar to be played normally at higher gain and higher volume. 

Other guitars are borderline between semi-acoustic and solid body. Known as a chambered body guitar, they start from a solid body &quot;blank&quot; that has been routed out to include a sound hole in an otherwise solid body. Examples include the Fender Telecaster Thinline.

==History==
In the 1930s, guitar manufacturers aimed at increasing the sound level produced by the instrument, to compete with louder instruments such as the drums. Companies such as Gibson, Rickenbacker, and Gretsch focused on amplifying a guitar through a loudspeaker. In 1936, Gibson introduced their first manufactured semi-acoustic guitar, the ES-150s (Electric Spanish Series).

Gibson based them on a standard production archtop, with F-holes on the face of the guitar&#x27;s soundbox. This model resembled traditional jazz guitars that were popular at the time. The soundbox on the guitar let limited sound emit from the hollow body of the guitar. The ES-150s could be electrically amplified via a Charlie Christian pickup, a magnetic single-coil pickup that converted the energy of the vibrating strings into an electrical signal. The clear sound of the pickups made the ES series popular with jazz musicians.

The ES-150 was made several years after Rickenbacker made the first solid-body electric guitar. The ES series was designed as an experiment for Gibson to test the potential success of electric guitars. Due to its financial success, the ES series is often referred to as the first successful electric guitar. The ES-150 was followed by the ES-250 a year later, in what became a long line of semi acoustics for the Gibson company.

In 1949 Gibson released two new models: the ES-175 and ES-5. The ES-175 and ES-5 models were the first to come with built-in electric pickups and are widely considered the first fully electric semi-acoustic guitars. Several models, including the ES-350T by Gibson, were made in the 1950s to accommodate a demand for a comfortable and modern version of the original archtop model.

In 1958, Gibson first manufactured a &#x27;semi-hollow body guitar&#x27; that featured a block of solid wood between the front and back sections of the guitars&#x27; cutaway. The guitar had a smaller resonant cavity inside, which makes less sound emit from the f holes.

Rickenbacker also began making semi-acoustic guitars in 1958. German guitar crafter, Roger Rossmiesl developed the 300 series for Rickenbacker. The series was a wide semi-acoustic that used a sleeker dash hole on one side of the guitar, with a pick guard on the other side, rather than a traditional F-hole.

In addition to the main model variants of the guitar, Gibson made several small changes to the guitar, including a laminated top for the ES-175 model and mounted top pickups for general use on all their models. While Gibson provided many of the innovations in semi-acoustic guitars from the 1930s to the 1950s, there were also various makes by other companies including a hollow archtop by Gretsch. The 6120 model by Gretsch became very popular as a rockabilly model despite having almost no technical differences from Gibson models. Rickenbacker was also a prominent maker of the semi-hollow body guitar. Gibson, Gretsch, Rickenbacker, and other companies still make semi-acoustic and semi-hollow body guitars.

==Usage==
The semi-acoustic and semi-hollow body guitars were used widely by jazz musicians in the 1930s. The guitar became used in pop, folk, and blues. The guitars sometimes produced feedback when played through an amplifier at a loud level so they were unpopular for bands that had to play loud enough to perform in large venues. As rock became more experimental in the late 60s and 70s, the guitar became more popular because players learned to use its feedback issues creatively.

Semi-hollow guitars share some of the tonal characteristics of hollow guitars, such as their praised warmth and clean tone, but with less risk of undesirable feedback. Their sound is particularly popular with jazz, blues, rockabilly and psychobilly guitarists.

Today, semi-acoustic and semi-hollow body guitars are still popular among many artists across various genres. Examples include Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, renowned jazz guitarist George Benson, John Scofield, multi-instrumentalist Paul McCartney, former Guns N&#x27; Roses member Izzy Stradlin, John Lennon of the Beatles, and B.B. King, and rock musician Ted Nugent. Semi-acoustic guitars have also been valued as practice guitars because, when played &quot;unplugged,&quot; they are quieter than full acoustic guitars, but more audible than solid-body electric guitars because of their open cavity. They are also popular because the cavities reduce the weight of the guitar.

<doc id="701728" wikidata="Q385854" url="?curid=701728" title="Skye Bridge">
<text>The Skye Bridge () is a road bridge over Loch Alsh, Scotland, connecting the Isle of Skye to the island of Eilean Bàn. The name is also used for the whole Skye Crossing, which further connects Eilean Bàn to the mainland across the Carrich Viaduct. The crossing forms part of the A87.

Traditionally, the usual route from the mainland to Skye was the shortest crossing, with a length of around , across the sound between the villages of Kyle of Lochalsh on the mainland and Kyleakin on the island&#x27;s east coast. A ferry service operated from around 1600, run by private operators and latterly by Caledonian MacBrayne.

==Background==
Road and rail connections to Kyle of Lochalsh were constructed towards the end of the 19th century and various parties proposed building a bridge to the island. Although the engineering task was well within the capability of the age (the crossing is shorter and shallower than that bridged by the Forth Bridge), the island&#x27;s remoteness and small population meant that the cost could not be justified.

By 1971 the two 28-car ferries carried more than 300,000 vehicles. Increased prosperity in the islands and a healthy summertime tourist traffic led to traffic queuing for the ferries. This brought renewed calls for the construction of a road bridge.

==Design and construction==
In 1989 Conservative junior minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton announced a bidding round, requested tenders to construct a toll bridge. A variety of locations and designs were proposed, and the contract was awarded to Miller-Dywidag, a consortium composed of Scottish construction company Miller Construction, German engineering company , and financial partner the Bank of America. The Miller-Dywidag proposal (designed in collaboration with civil engineering firm Arup) was for a single-span concrete arch, supported by two piers resting on caissons in the loch and using Eilean Bàn as a stepping-stone. The PFI plan was accepted, and received support from local MP Charles Kennedy and the local council in the full knowledge that it would be on a high-toll basis for a limited period. Although the bridge itself was built with PFI, the approach roads were the responsibility of the Scottish Office, which paid £15 million for the roads and associated improvements, and to cover the costs associated with decommissioning the ferry. Construction began in 1992 led by Project Director John Henderson and the bridge was opened by Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Forsyth on 16 October 1995. Then the ferry service ceased, and the bridge and the Mallaig-Armadale ferry were the only year-round connections to the mainland.

The two caissons that the main span stands on were cast as hollow cylinders in the old Kishorn Dry Dock and floated to site where they were sunk onto the prepared loch bed. Kishorn Dock had been built for the oil industry, but only built the one rig – Ninian Central.

==Toll controversy==
This was the first major capital project funded by the Private Finance Initiative, and in exchange for the contractors funding the bridge&#x27;s construction themselves (rather than being paid to do so from the public exchequer) they were granted a licence to operate the bridge and charge travellers tolls. When the contract was first awarded, the partnership estimated it would cost around £15 million, although delays and design changes added significantly to the cost (to around £25 million, by the BBC&#x27;s estimate).

The tolls charged by the bridge concessionaire, Skye Bridge Ltd., were particularly unpopular. By 2004 a round trip cost visitors £11.40, fourteen times the round trip price charged by the Forth Road Bridge, a crossing over twice the length. Protesters claimed the toll made it the most expensive road in Europe. While the Skye bridge was being built, several other, smaller bridges in the Hebrides were also being built or planned. These bridges were to connect smaller islands either to larger ones or to the mainland and were without tolls. Skye locals came to believe that the Skye bridge should also be a public road and free of tolls.

The ferry operator, Caledonian MacBrayne, had made a profit of over a million pounds per year on the route, but observers from the BofA and later the National Audit Office noted that many locals were excused the ferry fee by ferry workers, with much of the ferry&#x27;s revenue coming from the heavy summertime tourist traffic. In the bridge&#x27;s first year of operation it recorded traffic of 612,000 vehicles, a third more than the ferry&#x27;s official numbers.

The campaign included mass protests and a prolonged non-payment campaign, and continued as long as did the tolls. A toll-collector interviewed by the BBC said that abuse of collectors by motorists had been commonplace. Numerous toll opponents were cited for refusing to pay the toll, with around 500 being arrested and 130 subsequently convicted of non-payment. Among those charged was Clodagh Mackenzie, an elderly lady from whom the land necessary for the bridge&#x27;s arrival in Skye had been compulsorily purchased; the charges against her were subsequently dropped without explanation. Of those convicted, only the first, the SKAT Secretary Andy Anderson, received a (brief) prison term. Those charged with non-payment had to make the round trip to Dingwall Sheriff Court, again crossing the bridge and where again many refused to pay, incurring a further criminal charge. Robbie the Pict argued that the legal paperwork for the tolls was incomplete, and that consequently the tolls themselves were illegal. In particular he said that the &quot;assignation statement&quot;, a licence to charge a toll, had never been given. Interviewed later by the BBC, Fiscal David Hingston in Dingwall denied this claim, but admitted that he himself had been denied access to many government documents on the case, on the grounds of commercial confidentiality. Hingston told the BBC &quot;As a fiscal I was stuck with that evidence but as a private individual I found it stunning&quot;, leading to renewed calls that the convictions of the toll protesters should be quashed – to this the Crown Office reiterated that appeals on these grounds had already been rejected by the courts.

The bridge, and the toll protest, became a continuing political issue. Following the 1997 General Election, the Labour-run Scottish Office introduced a scheme whereby tolls for locals were subsidised (the scheme cost a total of £7 million). Following the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Labour Party joined in coalition with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, who had made the Skye Bridge toll abolition one of their priorities. With responsibility for Scotland&#x27;s road network transferred from Westminster to the Scottish Executive, increased political pressure was placed on the toll&#x27;s future. On 3 June 2004, Jim Wallace, the Enterprise Minister in the Scottish Executive announced that he hoped the bridge would be bought out, and tolls abolished, by the end of 2004. In line with this, on 21 December 2004, Scottish Transport Minister Nicol Stephen announced that the bridge had been purchased for approximately £27 million, and toll collection immediately ceased. During the preceding decade £33.3 million in tolls had been collected. Figures obtained by the BBC under freedom of information laws showed the consortium&#x27;s operating costs on the bridge during this period had been only £3.5 million.

&quot;An Drochaid&quot;, an hour-long documentary in Scottish Gaelic, was made for BBC Alba documenting the battle to remove the tolls.

<text>A buckling spring is a type of keyswitch mechanism, popularized by IBM&#x27;s keyboards for the PC, PC/AT, 5250/3270 terminals, PS/2, and other systems. It was used by IBM&#x27;s Model F keyboards (for instance the AT keyboard), and the more common Model M. It is described in (Model F) and (Model M), both now expired. According to the original patent: &quot;A non-teasible, snap action, tactile feedback, key mechanism of extreme mechanical simplicity and high reliability is achieved.&quot;

==Operation==
The coil spring tensed between the keycap and a pivoting hammer buckles (i.e. kinks or collapses) at a certain point in its downward traverse, providing auditory and tactile feedback to the keyboard operator. Upon buckling, the hammer is pivoted forward by the spring and strikes an electrical contact which registers the key press. In a Model M, the electrical contact is a membrane sheet similar to that of a modern dome switch keyboard.

<text>Thanos () is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-artist Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot; #55 (cover date February 1973). An Eternal–Deviant warlord from the moon Titan, Thanos is regarded as one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe. He has clashed with many heroes including the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men.

In creating Thanos, Starlin drew inspiration from Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;New Gods&quot; series for DC Comics, particularly the character of Darkseid. Thanos is usually portrayed as a villain, although many stories depict him as believing his actions to be justified. Perhaps the character&#x27;s best-known storyline is &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; (1991), the culmination of several story arcs that see him gather the six Infinity Gems and use them to kill half of the universe&#x27;s population, including many of its heroes, to woo Mistress Death, the living embodiment of death in the Marvel Universe. Although these events were later undone, the storyline has remained one of the most popular published by Marvel.

Debuting in the Bronze Age of comic books, the character has appeared in almost five decades of Marvel publications, as well as many media adaptations, including animated television series and video games.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the character was first played by Damion Poitier in the film &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012) and then by Josh Brolin in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), and the first season of the animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021).

== Creation ==
Writer-artist Jim Starlin conceived of Thanos of Titan during college psychology classes. As Starlin described:

Starlin has admitted the character&#x27;s look was influenced by Jack Kirby&#x27;s Darkseid:

== Publication history ==
Thanos debuted in &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot; #55 (February 1973), featuring a story by Jim Starlin that was co-scripted by Mike Friedrich. The storyline from that issue continued through &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; #25–33 (bi-monthly: March 1973 – Jan. 1974), &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; #12 (Nov. 1973), &quot;Daredevil&quot; #107 (Jan. 1974), and &quot;Avengers&quot; #125 (July 1974). He returned in an extended storyline that spanned &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #178–181 (Feb.–Aug. 1975), &quot;Warlock&quot; #9-11 (Oct. 1975 – Jan. 1976), &quot;Marvel Team Up&quot; #55 (March 1977), and the 1977 Annuals for &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; (Thanos does not actually appear until the end of &quot;Warlock&quot; #9). He was also featured in a short backup story in &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; #6 (June 1977) and had a small role in the &quot;Death of Captain Marvel&quot; graphic novel (April 1982).

The character was revived in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990) and guest-starred until issue #59 (November 1991), while simultaneously appearing in &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot; #1–2 (Sept. – Oct. 1990) and &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1–6 (July – Dec. 1991). After an appearance in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #17 (Dec. 1991), Thanos had a recurring role in &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; #1–42 (Feb. 1992 – Aug. 1995). This was followed by crossover appearances in &quot;Infinity War&quot; #1–6 (June – Nov. 1992), &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot; #1–6 (June – Nov. 1993), &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3, #86–88 (Nov. 1993 – Jan. 1994), &quot;Warlock Chronicles&quot; #6–8, &quot;Thor&quot; #468–471 (Nov. 1993 – Feb. 1994), &quot;Namor The Sub-Mariner&quot; #44 (Nov. 1993), &quot;Secret Defenders&quot; #11–14 (Jan. – April 1994), &quot;Cosmic Powers&quot; #1–6 (March – July 1994), and &quot;Cosmic Powers Unlimited&quot; #1 (May 1995).

Thanos appeared in a connected storyline in &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; vol. 2, #4–11 (Aug. 1997 – March 1998), &quot;Ka-Zar Annual&quot; (1997), and the &quot;X-Man&quot; and &quot;Hulk Annual&quot; (1998), before featuring in &quot;Thor&quot; vol. 2, #21–25 (March – July 2000) and the 2000 Annual. The character was next used in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; vol. 4, #17–19 (June–Aug. 2001), &quot;Avengers: Celestial Quest&quot; #1–8 (Nov. 2001 – June 2002), &quot;Infinity Abyss&quot; #1–6 (Aug. – Oct. 2002) and &quot;&quot; #1–6 (May – Aug 2003).

In 2004 Thanos received an eponymous title that ran for 12 issues. In 2006, the character played an important role in &quot;Annihilation: Silver Surfer&quot; #1–4 (June – Sept. 2006) and &quot;Annihilation&quot; #1–6 (Oct. 2006 – March 2007). The character was re-introduced in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 2, #24–25 (April – May 2010) and played a major role in &quot;The Thanos Imperative: Ignition&quot; (June 2010) and &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; #1–6 (July – Dec. 2010).

The character returned in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; #1 (March 2012). A mini-series titled &quot;Thanos: Son of Titan&quot; by Joe Keatinge was planned for publication in August 2012, but was cancelled.

The character&#x27;s origin was expanded in the five-issue &quot;Thanos Rising&quot; miniseries by Jason Aaron and Simone Bianchi which was published monthly beginning in April 2013. Later that same year, Thanos played a central role in the &quot;Infinity&quot; miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Jim Cheung, Jerome Opeña, and Dustin Weaver.

In May 2014, Jim Starlin and Ron Lim worked together on the one-shot &quot;Thanos Annual&quot;, which is a prelude to a new trilogy of original graphic novels. The first, &quot;Thanos: The Infinity Revelation&quot;, was released the following August. Beginning in February 2015, Starlin also penned a four-issue miniseries titled &quot;Thanos vs. Hulk&quot;, which was set prior to the graphic novels. The second installment in the trilogy, &quot;Thanos: The Infinity Relativity&quot;, was released in June 2015. The third graphic novel, &quot;Thanos: The Infinity Finale&quot;, as well as the connected mini-series &quot;The Infinity Entity&quot; were published in 2016.

At the same time Starlin was writing these graphic novels and tie-ins, the character also appeared in &quot;New Avengers&quot; #23–24 (Oct – Nov 2014), &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 3, #18–20 (Oct – Dec 2014), &quot;Legendary Star-Lord&quot; #4 (Dec 2014), a six-issue miniseries titled &quot;Thanos: A God Up There Listening&quot; (Dec 2014), &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 5, #40–41 (Mar – Apr 2015), and &quot;Deadpool&quot; vol. 3, #45 (&quot;#250&quot;) (Jun 2015). Thanos also played a major role in the five-issue miniseries &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; vol. 2, (July 2015 – Jan 2016), a tie-in of the cross-over &quot;Secret Wars&quot; (2015).

In 2017, as part of Marvel NOW!, Thanos received his own solo title written by Jeff Lemire and drawn by Mike Deodato. After 11 issues, Donny Cates and Geoff Shaw took over as the creative team. This storyline crossed over with Donny Cates&#x27; Cosmic Ghost Rider storyline.

In 2021, Thanos was later reintroduced as a primary antagonist in the comic series &quot;Eternals&quot; vol. 5, #1–12, by the writer Kieron Gillen and artist Esad Ribić, and plays a prominent role in exploring Eternals mythos and retcons.

== Fictional character biography ==
Thanos was born on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan as the son of Eternals A&#x27;lars and Sui-San, the grandson of Kronos, the nephew of Zuras, and the grandnephew of Oceanus and Uranos. His brother is Eros of Titan. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals&#x27; cousin race. Shocked by his appearance and the belief that he would destroy all life in the universe, Sui-San went insane and attempted to kill him, but she was stopped by A&#x27;lars. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist and would only play with his brother Eros and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with nihilism and entropy, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of Mistress Death.

At some point in his youth, a younger Thanos was sent to Earth by Mephisto where he fought the prehistoric Avengers where he was repelled.

As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge using a combination of mysticism and cybernetic enhancements. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.

Wishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race. Seeking universal power in the form of the Cosmic Cube, Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car as a family witnesses his arrival. Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father&#x27;s spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity Kronos and is given a new form as Drax the Destroyer while the daughter is found by Thanos&#x27;s father, Mentor, and is raised to become the heroine Moondragon. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts Kree hero Captain Marvel, who, with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and ISAAC (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.

Thanos later comes to the aid of Adam Warlock in a war against the Magus and his religious empire. During the process, he ends up adopting Gamora to use her as his assassin and kill Adam Warlock before becoming Magus. During this alliance Thanos cultivates a plan to reunite with Mistress Death, and secretly siphons off the energies of Warlock&#x27;s Soul Gem, combining these with the power of the other Infinity Gems to create a weapon capable of destroying a star. Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the Thing. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone. Thanos&#x27;s spirit eventually reappears to accompany a dying Captain Marvel&#x27;s soul into the realm of Death.

During the &quot;Infinity Saga&quot; storyline, Thanos is eventually resurrected and collects the Infinity Gems once again. He uses the gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet, making himself omnipotent, and erases half the living things in the universe to prove his love to Death. This act and several other acts are soon undone by Nebula and Adam Warlock. Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power. Thanos joins Warlock as part of the Infinity Watch and helps him to defeat first his evil and then good personas, and cure Thor of &quot;warrior Madness&quot;.

Thanos later recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of Geatar in a mission to capture an ancient robot containing the obscure knowledge of a universal library and extract its data. Thanos uses information from the robot to plot against and battle Tyrant, the first creation of Galactus turned destroyer. When trapped in an alternate dimension, Thanos employs the aid of the brother of Ka-Zar, Parnival Plunder and later the Hulk to escape, although both attempts are unsuccessful. Thanos is eventually freed and comes into conflict with Thor, aligning himself with Mangog in a scheme to obtain powerful mystical and cosmic talismans which will allow him to destroy all life in the universe, and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet Rigel-3.

Thanos then uses the heroes Thor and Genis-Vell (Captain Marvel&#x27;s son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected. Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers&#x27; former member Mantis and her son Quoi, who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the &quot;Rot&quot;, a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos&#x27;s incessant love for Death. Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, studying many of the universe&#x27;s heroes and villains before cloning them, and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of Professor X, Iron Man, Gladiator, Doctor Strange, and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos – with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange – destroys the remaining clones.

When the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten uses a source of cosmic power, the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth&#x27;s heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten&#x27;s actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe, for which Mistress Death kisses him, and speaks to him for the first time. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.

Thanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.

En route to the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death for the first time since re-building existence with the Heart of the Universe. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, who has retired himself from the role of Star-Lord, and the Strontian warrior Gladiator of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire, who are both prisoners, as well as the Beyonder, who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely to prevent the entity from being reborn. The destruction frees Thanos and his fellow inmates, and he finds himself accompanied by the chaos-mite Skreet in his plans to leave the remains of the prison. He discovers, however, that the destruction wrought by the battle with the Beyonder has freed the last prisoner brought in by Peter Quill before he gave up the title of Star-Lord: the Fallen One, revealed to be the true first Herald of Galactus, who had been held in a container deep in the Kyln. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control. He later appears in Wisconsin attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl. After the battle, Uatu the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.

During the Annihilation War, Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain Annihilus. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters Tenebrous and Aegis: two of Galactus&#x27;s ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus&#x27;s true goal is to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. Drax the Destroyer kills Thanos before he can do so but discovers that Thanos had placed a failsafe device to allow Silver Surfer to free Galactus in the event that Annihilus betrayed him. During a climactic battle with Annihilus, Nova is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death.

During &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; storyline, a cocoon protected by the Universal Church of Truth is revealed to be hiding Thanos, who has been chosen by Oblivion to be the new Avatar of Death. Resurrected before his mind could be fully formed, Thanos goes on a mindless rampage before being captured by the Guardians of the Galaxy. Thanos pretends to aid the Guardians against the invading Cancerverse, and after discovering its origin kills an alternate version of Mar-Vell, the self-proclaimed Avatar of Life. This causes the collapse of the Cancerverse, and Nova sacrifices himself in an attempt to contain Thanos inside the imploding reality. Thanos escapes and returns to Earth seeking an artificial cosmic cube. He forms an incarnation of the criminal group Zodiac to retrieve it, but he is defeated by the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy and remanded to the custody of the Elders of the Universe.

During the &quot;Infinity&quot; storyline, Thanos soon invades Earth again after being informed that most of the Avengers have temporarily left the planet. He launches an assault on Attilan, which he offers to spare in exchange for the deaths of all Inhumans between the ages of 16 and 22. Black Bolt later informs the Illuminati that the true purpose of the invasion is to find and kill Thane, an Eternal/Inhuman hybrid that Thanos had secretly fathered years earlier. Thanos is trapped in a pocket limbo of stasis by his son. Thanos is freed by Namor and was among the villains that joined his Cabal to destroy other worlds. Thanos later meets his end on Battleworld, where he is easily killed by God Emperor Doom during an attempted insurrection.

Investigating a temporal anomaly on Titan during &quot;The Infinity Conflict&quot;, Thanos finds Pip the Troll and an older Eros who has come from the future. Eros tells him about an enemy made out darkness that will destroy Thanos in the future. Eros and Thanos craft a plan, but when they go to implement it Thanos is confronted by his future self who tells him to alter the plan to ensure his safety. The future Thanos then takes control of the past Thanos&#x27; body. Under the control of his future self, Thanos began searching through ancient temples and sites to find something that would allow him to eventually become like his future. Through his journey he was also forced to kill Adam Warlock who might interfere with his future&#x27;s plan. After being unable to locate Eros, his future self tells Thanos that Eros was extremely important to his cosmic masterwork. Then after locating a moving comet Thanos goes to the comet which contained a treasure more powerful than the Infinity Gems. Despite the speed of comet being enough to immediately vaporize any being Thanos was able to get it since he &quot;existed outside the norm&quot;. With this artifact Thanos was able to absorb every cosmic being that exists in his universe, eventually facing Eternity and Infinity. Despite their best effort Thanos defeats them and absorbs the two beings. He then merges with his future self finally taking the battle to the Living Tribunal and the One Above All. Facing the One Above All and the Living Tribunal, Thanos&#x27; future self went on to absorb both of them becoming the entirety of the Multiverse. As the multiverse began dying, while his future self searched for Eros, present Thanos was locked away within his future&#x27;s psyche not allowed to interfere. In a desperate ditch effort to prevent all of this Eros, alongside Pip, travel to different points of Thanos&#x27; past and tell him he is not alone and that he is loved. However, it is all in vain as Thanos simply did not care, but these temporal paradoxes did allow present Thanos to use that little access of his future&#x27;s power to talk to Eros through his past selves. He directs Eros and Pip to his future&#x27;s psyche and had Eros free him, but unfortunately this allows future Thanos to finally find Eros and had him absorbed inside his universe. Then Adam Warlock came and refuses to free Thanos because he would end up as Eros and tells Thanos that trust would be the only thing that would stop future Thanos. As his future self saw that existence was just a never-endless cycle which trapped all beings decided to commit suicide and &quot;free&quot; everyone from this &quot;torture&quot;. Thankfully, Kang prevented Eros from going to talk to Thanos&#x27; past selves which allowed him to avoid capture. This caused future Thanos to get distracted which allowed present Thanos to take control and reset everything prior to his future machinations, while erasing his future in the process.

Thanos is unintentionally brought back to the universe by Galactus.

When Thanos prepares to raid a Project Pegasus facility to steal a Cosmic Cube during the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, he is ambushed and defeated by a team of Avengers who were tipped off by a vision from Ulysses Cain. During their battle, he mortally wounds War Machine and critically injures She-Hulk. After his defeat, he is imprisoned in the Triskelion, and manipulates Anti-Man into facilitating his escape. Thanos goes on a killing spree, but Black Panther, Blue Marvel and Monica Rambeau are able to stop him by devising a device that blocks the electrical synapses in his brain.

Thanos somehow later recovers during the &quot;Thanos Returns&quot; story and escapes captivity, and reclaims his Black Order forces from Corvus Glaive. After retaking command of his Black Quadrant outpost, Thanos discovers that he is dying. Thanos tries to force his father, Mentor, to find a cure for his malady, but kills him when he is unable to. Soon after Thanos would be battered and detained by the Shi&#x27;ar Imperial Guard after he invaded the very planet station of his father&#x27;s facility sitting in their territory. A quick jump into the future shows Thanos&#x27;s estranged son Thane having bested his mad father with the personification of death at his side. Presently locked within a maximum security cosmic Alcatraz, Thanos sits alone within a cell as his sickness ravages his body. All while being mocked by its prison warden whom he lured into a false sense of security to escape; ripping off his arm for escape access and murdering half his personal staff in a bid for freedom. Having narrowly escaped his imprisonment before its self-destruction, Thanos retreats to a hidden outpost where a roving mercenary colony loyal only to him was once stationed. Only to find it decimated at the hand of the new lover of Mistress Death; who reveals that she had stricken her former avatar with his fatal sickness, being his son Thane, now boasting the power of the Phoenix Force. Whom under her coaxing, had banished the mad titan back to the decimated Moon of Titan now entirely stripped of his godlike powers. For the next few months, Thanos would survive alone and all but powerless in the ruins of his home city. Surviving off the flesh of mutated vermin and being accosted by local scavengers who preyed upon him in his weakened condition, he is soon picked up by the unlikely crew of Thane&#x27;s betrayed cohorts Tryco Slatterus, his adopted daughter Nebula and his brother Eros of Titan. Having heard of their plight, the three were dismayed to find Thanos stripped of all he was and had ever been; his second daughter only agreeing to come along so she could kill her father, immediately assaulted him. Starfox was able to preempt her attempt at patricide while inviting his wayward tyrant of a brother aboard their vessel. Thanos mentioned the only way for him to be relieved of his mortality was to seek out the God Quarry heralded by The Witches of Infinity. Starfox initially wrote this off as fable and folklore. Now on the path to the cosmic coven set at the edge of the known universe, Thanos and crew stop short of a black hole, knowing full well that it is where the witches make their home. The Mad Titan jumps into the pinhole of nothingness alongside his brother; having survived the crushing force of the singularity they dove into, Thanos and Eros are greeted by the Coven at the godly graveyard. Thanos demands the three that are one to return his godhood to him. Starfox tries his best to charm the enchantresses only to be rebuked by them, much to Thanos&#x27;s joy when they prematurely aged him. Seeing as it was neither their place to destroy nor turn away those seeking them, The Witches profess the only way for the warlord to be made whole again was to climb down into the God Quarry and await a trial that would test his soul. Immediately after setting foot within the graveyard of old gods, Thanos is subsumed into the bedrock within which they rest. As his journey of the core being commenced, Thanos&#x27;s trial began with him as leader of earth and the universes greatest champions, the Avengers. But he is unable to escape the nagging feeling that he has forgotten something, until the quarry itself wearing the guise of Falcon reminds him of who he used to be; tempting him to live as a hero and a man at peace for the first time in his immortal life. But Thanos laughs maniacally as he coldly rebukes such a path, ruthlessly killing his would-be friends and allies while choosing to remain whom he always was. His cosmic might returned to him, Thanos is freed from the God Quarry, wherein he immediately accosts his brother Eros and threatens the coven to release him from their domain so that he might do away with Thane once and for all.

Around the time of the New Thor&#x27;s appearance, Thanos is approached by a mysterious hooded woman, who proposes an alliance. He tasks her with bringing him the hammer of the deceased Ultimate Thor. The woman fails, but removes her disguise to reveal herself as Hela, the Norse goddess of death. She tells Thanos that she needs his help to reclaim Hel, and in exchange, offers to give him the one thing he has been searching for his entire life: death. After this, the two kiss.

Some time after his battle with Thane during the &quot;Thanos Wins&quot; story, Thanos travels to the Chitauri homeworld. However, upon subjugating the planet, he is attacked by a being identified only as The Rider, who captures Thanos and uses a piece of the fractured Time Stone to bring Thanos millions of years into the future, where he encounters an elderly version of himself who has destroyed nearly all life in the universe. At first, Thanos believes it to be some sort of trick, but is convinced once the future Thanos utters the name Dione, which Thanos&#x27;s mother had planned to name him before she went insane. King Thanos reveals he needs his younger self&#x27;s assistance to defeat the Fallen One, the last being left in the Universe, so that he may finally reunite with Death. The Fallen One soon arrives, revealed to be a darkened Silver Surfer armed with the hordes of Annihilus and the deceased Thor&#x27;s Mjolnir, using the latter to swiftly kill the Rider. The Surfer is distracted by the feral Hulk that Thanos kept chained in his basement, allowing the two Thanos to kill him using Surtur&#x27;s Twilight Sword. Upon the Surfer&#x27;s death, Death arrives, and Thanos realizes the true reason that King Thanos brought him into the future: so that King Thanos can finally die, reasoning that if he must die, it can only be at the hands of himself. At first, Thanos is more than happy to oblige his future counterpart&#x27;s request, but quickly stops, disappointed at how pathetic and submissive his older self has become. Resolving to never become as pathetic and complacent as King Thanos has become, Thanos uses the fragment of the Time Stone and the Power Cosmic left in the Surfer&#x27;s corpse to return to the present day. As the future begins to crumble around him, King Thanos realizes that his younger self has taken the steps necessary to ensure that this timeline will never take place. As he fades into nothingness, King Thanos asks Death what his younger self did, to which she simply responds &quot;he won.&quot;

During the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; storyline, Thanos later discovers that the Infinity Stones are being collected once again and begins plotting to reassemble his gauntlet. However, he is assaulted by Requiem, whom he apparently recognizes, and is quickly killed. She then destroys the Infinity Gauntlet and also commands the Chitauri loyal to Thanos to die.

In a prelude to the &quot;A.X.E.: Judgment Day&quot; storyline, Thanos is revived by Druig and Phastos as their plan to remove Zuras from his leadership after learning the Machine&#x27;s purpose for their resurrection. Druig places a device inside his body to prevent his treachery. After receiving a vote from the Uni-Mind, Thanos becomes the Prime Eternal and kills Zuras for revenge and Druig to hide his weakness. He has Druig revived and visits his great uncle Uranos in the Exclusion where Thanos learns the Eternals&#x27; three principles. After Druig departs, Uranos gives Thanos an imprint key that enables an armory to access the fail-safe that Uranos put in. Thanos is told by the Eternal scientist Domo that his genes deriving from Eternals and Deviants are the reason why the Machine does not recognize him as an Eternal. As Thanos fights the Eternals, Druig betrays Thanos and activates the fail-safe in Thanos&#x27; armor which causes Thanos to die from his mutation. With Thanos gone, Druig becomes the new Prime Eternal.

== Powers and abilities ==
Thanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutant–Eternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of telekinesis and telepathy. He can manipulate matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.

Thanos has proven himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin, and of blasting Galactus off his feet.

Thanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, force field projection, teleportation, time travel, and movement through alternate universes. Thanos is also a master strategist and uses several space vessels, at least three under the name &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, as a base of operations.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical response ===
George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked Thanos 1st in their &quot;Best Marvel supervillains&quot; list, while ranked him 6th in their &quot;Best Marvel characters of all time&quot; list. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; ranked Thanos 6th in their &quot;28 Best Marvel Villains&quot; list. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Thanos 6th in their &quot;Top 25 Marvel Villains&quot; list, and 47th in their &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains&quot; list. Rachel Ulatowski of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; ranked Thanos 7th in their &quot;Strongest Marvel Villains&quot; list. Jason Serafino of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Thanos 21st in their &quot;25 Greatest Comic Book Villains of All Time&quot; list.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Thanos in their &quot;20 Most Powerful Marvel Villains&quot; list, and ranked him 8th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Members Of The Eternals&quot; list, and 10th in their &quot;25 Greatest Comic Book Supervillains Of All Time&quot; list. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Thanos 1st in their &quot;13 Most Important Marvel Villains&quot; list, 2nd in their &quot;10 Strongest Characters From Eternals Comics&quot; list, and 2nd in their &quot;15 Most Powerful Eternals&quot; list.

=== Impact ===
In July 2018, the Reddit forum /r/ThanosDidNothingWrong, dedicated to sharing theories and memes about the character, went viral when it was announced that half of the forum&#x27;s subscribers would be banned, mirroring Thanos’ plan to eradicate half of all life in the universe. The number of subscribers rose from 100,000 users in June, to over 700,000 on July 9, leading to over 350,000 users being banned, the largest such banning in Reddit&#x27;s history. JV Chamar of &quot;Forbes&quot; stated that &quot;Thanos did nothing wrong&quot; has become a popular internet meme, and that the film &quot;Endgame&quot; provides some evidence in favor of this view, in particular when Captain America says, &quot;I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge ... There&#x27;s fewer ships, cleaner water.&quot; The author notes that given the contemporary extinction crisis driven by human actions, &quot;you could indeed argue that Thanos did nothing wrong — and in the long run, the villain might have actually saved the world.&quot;

One of its recruits is a variation of the younger Thanos called Kid Thanos. Kid Thanos accompanied Doom Supreme in attacking Avengers Mountain. They fought Black Panther, Namor, and Valkyrie up to the point where Avengers Mountain exploded. Afterwards, both of them had spoken with Mephisto and Iron Inquisitor before rejoining with the other Multiversal Masters of Evil members so that they can get back to work.

In a flashback, Kid Thanos was with the Multiversal Masters of Evil when they attacked Earth-91.

Kid Thanos was with the Multiversal Masters of Evil when they attacked an unidentified Earth. Afterwards, they were attacked by Ghost Rider where he used his Hell Charger to knock down Kid Thanos and Hound.

Kid Thanos was with the Multiversal Masters of Evil when they arrived on Earth-616 during prehistoric times. During the fight between the Multiversal Masters of Evil and both Avengers teams, Kid Thanos fights Captain America and Prehistoric Moon Knight.

With some power donation from Soldier Supreme of 1943, Kid Starbrand and Reno Phoenix of 1868, Ghost Ronin of 1655, and the Tyrannosaurus Starbrand of 66,000,000 BC, Echo defeats Kid Thanos.

<doc id="701743" wikidata="Q433459" url="?curid=701743" title="Kitty Carlisle">
<text>Kitty Carlisle Hart (born Catherine Conn; September 3, 1910 – April 17, 2007) was an American stage and screen actress, opera singer, television personality and spokesperson for the arts. She was the leading lady in the Marx Brothers movie &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935) and was a regular panelist on the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; (1956–1978). She served 20 years on the New York State Council on the Arts.

In 1991, she received the National Medal of Arts from President George H. W. Bush. She was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Early life==
Kitty Carlisle was born Catherine Conn (pronounced Cohen) in New Orleans, Louisiana, of German-Jewish heritage. Her grandfather, Ben Holzman, was a mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana, and a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War. He had been a gunner on the , the Confederate ironclad warship that fought the at the Battle of Hampton Roads. Her father, Joseph Conn, MD, was a gynecologist who died when she was ten years old. Her mother, Hortense Holzman Conn, was eager for her daughter to be accepted by local society. A taxi driver once asked if her daughter was Jewish, and she answered, &quot;She may be, but I&#x27;m not.&quot;

Carlisle&#x27;s mother took her to Europe in 1921, where she hoped Kitty would marry European royalty, believing nobility were more likely to marry a Jewish girl. They traveled around Europe and often lived in what Carlisle recalled as &quot;the worst room of the best hotel&quot;. Kitty was educated at the in Lausanne, Switzerland, then at the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics. She studied acting in London at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She studied singing with Estelle Liebling, the teacher of Beverly Sills, in New York City.

==Career==
===Acting===

After returning to New York in 1932 with her mother, she appeared, billed as Kitty Carlisle, on Broadway in several operettas and musical comedies, and in the American premiere of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;. She also sang the title role in Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in Salt Lake City. She privately studied voice with Juilliard teacher Anna E. Schoen-Rene, who had been a student of Pauline Viardot-Garcia and Manuel Garcia.

Carlisle&#x27;s early movies included &quot;Murder at the Vanities&quot; (1934), &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935) with the Marx Brothers, and two films with Bing Crosby, &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot; (1934) and &quot;Here Is My Heart&quot; (1934).
Carlisle resumed her film career later in life, appearing in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987) and in &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (1993), as well as on stage in a revival of &quot;On Your Toes&quot;, replacing Dina Merrill. Her last movie appearance was in &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002) in which she played herself in a dramatization of a 1970s &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; episode.

For her contributions to the film industry, Carlisle was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 6611 Hollywood Boulevard.

===Television===
Carlisle became a household name through &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, where she was a regular panelist from 1956 to 1978, and later appeared on revivals of the series in 1980, 1990–91 and one episode in 2000. (One of her most notable hallmarks was her writing of the number one: When she voted 
for the member of the team of challengers who occupied the number one seat, it was written with a Roman numeral I.) She was also a semi-regular panelist on &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Missing Links&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

===Opera===
On December 31, 1966, Carlisle made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera, as Prince Orlofsky in Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. She sang the role 10 more times that season, then returned in 1973 for four more performances. Her final performance with the company was on July 7, 1973. She reprised this role during the Beverly Sills Farewell Gala in October 1980.

==Personal life==

Carlisle dated George Gershwin in 1933 &quot;until George went to California&quot;. On August 10, 1946, she married playwright and theatrical producer Moss Hart, whom she met at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. They had two children. Hart died on December 20, 1961, at their home in Palm Springs, California. She never remarried, although she briefly dated former governor and presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey after the death of his wife. During the 1980s and 1990s, Carlisle was the partner of diplomatic historian Ivo John Lederer, a relationship that lasted 16 years until Lederer&#x27;s death in 1998. In her later years, she kept company with financier and art collector Roy Neuberger.

Carlisle was known for her gracious manner and personal elegance, and she became prominent in New York City social circles as she crusaded for financial support of the arts. She was appointed to various statewide councils, and was chairperson of the New York State Council on the Arts from 1976 to 1996. One of the two state theaters housed at &quot;The Egg&quot; performing arts venue in Albany is named the &quot;Kitty Carlisle Hart Theatre&quot;. She also served on the boards of various New York City cultural institutions and made an appearance at the annual CIBC World Markets Miracle Day, a children&#x27;s charity event. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997.

Carlisle also widely performed her one-woman show, in which she told anecdotes about the great men of American musical theater she had known, notably George Gershwin (who had proposed marriage), Irving Berlin, Kurt Weill, Oscar Hammerstein, Alan Jay Lerner, and Frederick Loewe, and interspersed with songs that had made each of them famous.

===Historic preservation===
Carlisle Hart was a longtime champion of Historic Preservation in New York City and State. While chair of the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), from 1976 to 1996, she directed many millions of dollars in support to preservation projects, from the Niagara Frontier to Staten Island. This was in an effort to keep historic preservation as a core program of the New York State Council on the Arts, the only arts council in America that provides such funding. In 1980, she was crowned Queen of the Beaux Arts Ball, an annual event run by the Beaux Arts Society (American comedian Paul Lynde was crowned King the same year).

In recognition of this legacy, the Historic Districts Council presented its Landmarks Lion award to her in 2003.

==Death==
Carlisle died on April 17, 2007, from congestive heart failure resulting from a prolonged bout of pneumonia. She had been in and out of the hospital since she contracted pneumonia some time prior to November 2006. She died in her Upper East Side, Manhattan apartment, with her son, Christopher Hart, at her bedside. She was interred in a crypt next to her husband, Moss Hart, at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.
