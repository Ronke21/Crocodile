<text>Willis Alan Ramsey (born 5 March 1951) is an American singer/songwriter, a cult legend among fans of Americana and Texas country. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and raised in Dallas, Texas. Ramsey graduated from Highland Park High School in 1969, and was a prominent baritone in the school&#x27;s Lads and Lassies Choir. In his senior year, he played a leading role in the musical &quot;Carousel&quot;. He released the critically acclaimed album, &quot;Willis Alan Ramsey&quot;, in 1972 on the Shelter label. The album included &quot;Muskrat Candlelight&quot; which was covered (under the title &quot;Muskrat Love&quot;) by America in 1973 and by Captain &amp; Tennille in 1976.

Owing to conflict with his label, Ramsey left Shelter at the end of his contract. As a result, Ramsey&#x27;s fans have been waiting half a century for the release of his &quot;mythical second album&quot;. When asked where the new album is, he often responds, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with the first one?&quot;

In the 1980s, he moved to Great Britain to reconnect with his ancestry and study traditional and modern music narrative. At the same time, he enjoyed a revival in the United States, due in part to numerous artists who cut versions of Ramsey&#x27;s songs, including Widespread Panic (&quot;Geraldine &amp; The Honey Bee&quot;), Jerry Jeff Walker (&quot;Northeast Texas Women&quot;), Waylon Jennings, Shawn Colvin (&quot;Satin Sheets&quot;), Jimmy Buffett (&quot;The Ballad of Spider John&quot;), and Jimmie Dale Gilmore (&quot;Goodbye to Old Missoula&quot;). In 1989, he returned to the United States and began performing again. Backed by Champ Hood, multi-instrumentalist (of Uncle Walt&#x27;s Band fame), Ramsey could often be found on the same bill with another Dallas singer-songwriter, Alison Rogers. The two married in 1991 and continue to perform together. In 1996, Ramsey and Rogers co-wrote Lyle Lovett&#x27;s hit, &quot;That&#x27;s Right (You&#x27;re Not from Texas)&quot;.

In 2000, Ramsey appeared on &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, showcasing his new material and performing his classics. He is currently mixing his new album, &quot;Gentilly&quot;, so called since 1997. &quot;Gentilly&quot; is planned to be an independent release, financed by friends and fans mostly from the Dallas and Austin area. Currently working with Jonathan Day of the band Pressbox. Co-produced by Ramsey, Alison Rogers and Jamie Oldaker, guest musicians include Oldaker (drums, percussion); Sam Bush &amp; Tim O&#x27;Brien (mandolin, vocals); Viktor Krauss, Roscoe Beck &amp; Freebo (bass); Bruce Bouton (steel guitar); Mickey Raphael (harmonica); Walt Richmond (piano, organ); Joel Guzman (accordion); Marcia Ball, Tommy Malone, Abra Moore &amp; Alison Rogers (vocals). Ramsey, Rogers, and Everett Moran are engineering.

<text>The Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) consists of a global reference ellipsoid and a normal gravity model. The GRS80 gravity model has been followed by the newer more accurate Earth Gravitational Models, but the GRS80 reference ellipsoid is still the most accurate in use for coordinate reference systems, e.g. for the international ITRS, the European ETRS89 and (with a 0,1 mm rounding error) for WGS 84 used for the American Global Navigation Satellite System (GPS).

==Background==
Geodesy is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth, its gravitational field and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion, earth tides, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional, time-varying space.

The geoid is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of sea water, the mean sea level surface in the absence of currents, air pressure variations etc. and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the ellipsoid, is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between it and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal , or more usually the geoid-ellipsoid separation, &quot;N&quot;. It varies globally between .

A reference ellipsoid, customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial
radius) &quot;a&quot; and flattening &quot;f&quot;. The quantity &quot;f&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;−&quot;b&quot;)/&quot;a&quot;, where &quot;b&quot; is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of the earth (dynamical flattening, symbol &quot;J&quot;2) is determined to high precision by observation of satellite orbit perturbations. Its relationship with the geometric flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution.

The 1980 Geodetic Reference System (GRS 80) posited a semi-major axis and a flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in Canberra, Australia, 1979.

The GRS 80 reference system was originally used by the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The reference ellipsoid of WGS 84 now differs slightly due to later refinements.

The numerous other systems which have been used by diverse countries for their maps and charts are gradually dropping out of use as more and more countries move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS80 reference ellipsoid.

==Definition==
The reference ellipsoid is usually defined by its semi-major axis (equatorial
radius) formula_1 and either its semi-minor axis (polar radius) formula_2, aspect ratio formula_3 or flattening formula_4, but GRS80 is an exception: &quot;four&quot; independent constants are required for a complete definition. GRS80 chooses as these formula_1, formula_6, formula_7 and formula_8, making the geometrical constant formula_4 a derived quantity.

; Defining geometrical constants
:Semi-major axis = Equatorial Radius = formula_10;

; Defining physical constants
:Geocentric gravitational constant determined from the gravitational constant and the earth mass with atmosphere formula_11;
:Dynamical form factor formula_12;
:Angular velocity of rotation formula_13;

==Derived quantities==

; Derived geometrical constants (all rounded)
:Flattening = formula_4 = 0.003 352 810 681 183 637 418;
:Reciprocal of flattening = formula_15 = 298.257 222 100 882 711 243;
:Semi-minor axis = Polar Radius = formula_2 = 6 356 752.314 140 347 m;
:Aspect ratio = formula_17 = 0.996 647 189 318 816 363;
:Mean radius as defined by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG): formula_18 = 6 371 008.7714 m;
:Authalic mean radius = formula_19 = 6 371 007.1809 m;
:Radius of a sphere of the same volume = formula_20 = 6 371 000.7900 m;
:Linear eccentricity = formula_21 = 521 854.0097 m;
:Eccentricity of elliptical section through poles = formula_22 = 0.081 819 191 0428;
:Polar radius of curvature = formula_23 = 6 399 593.6259 m;
:Equatorial radius of curvature for a meridian = formula_24 = 6 335 439.3271 m;
:Meridian quadrant = 10 001 965.7292 m;

; Derived physical constants (rounded)
:Period of rotation (sidereal day) = formula_25 = 86 164.100 637 s

The formula giving the eccentricity of the GRS80 spheroid is:

:formula_26

where

:formula_27

and formula_28 (so formula_29). The equation is solved iteratively to give

:formula_30

which gives

:formula_31

<doc id="711718" wikidata="Q430465" url="?curid=711718" title="Evolutionary taxonomy">
<text>Evolutionary taxonomy, evolutionary systematics or Darwinian classification is a branch of biological classification that seeks to classify organisms using a combination of phylogenetic relationship (shared descent), progenitor-descendant relationship (serial descent), and degree of evolutionary change. This type of taxonomy may consider whole taxa rather than single species, so that groups of species can be inferred as giving rise to new groups. The concept found its most well-known form in the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 1940s.

Evolutionary taxonomy differs from strict pre-Darwinian Linnaean taxonomy (producing orderly lists only) in that it builds evolutionary trees. While in phylogenetic nomenclature each taxon must consist of a single ancestral node and all its descendants, evolutionary taxonomy allows for groups to be excluded from their parent taxa (e.g. dinosaurs are not considered to &quot;include&quot; birds, but to have &quot;given rise&quot; to them), thus permitting paraphyletic taxa.

==Origin of evolutionary taxonomy==

Evolutionary taxonomy arose as a result of the influence of the theory of evolution on Linnaean taxonomy. The idea of translating Linnaean taxonomy into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal and Plant kingdoms was formulated toward the end of the 18th century, well before Charles Darwin&#x27;s book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was published. The first to suggest that organisms had common descent was Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis in his 1751 &quot;Essai de Cosmologie&quot;, Transmutation of species entered wider scientific circles with Erasmus Darwin&#x27;s 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck&#x27;s 1809 &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot;. The idea was popularised in the English-speaking world by the speculative but widely read &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.

Following the appearance of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, Tree of Life representations became popular in scientific works. In &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, the ancestor remained largely a hypothetical species; Darwin was primarily occupied with showing the principle, carefully refraining from speculating on relationships between living or fossil organisms and using theoretical examples only. In contrast, Chambers had proposed specific hypotheses, the evolution of placental mammals from marsupials, for example.

Following Darwin&#x27;s publication, Thomas Henry Huxley used the fossils of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Hesperornis&quot; to argue that the birds are descendants of the dinosaurs. Thus, a group of extant animals could be tied to a fossil group. The resulting description, that of dinosaurs &quot;giving rise to&quot; or being &quot;the ancestors of&quot; birds, exhibits the essential hallmark of evolutionary taxonomic thinking.

The past three decades have seen a dramatic increase in the use of DNA sequences for reconstructing phylogeny and a parallel shift in emphasis from evolutionary taxonomy towards Hennig&#x27;s &#x27;phylogenetic systematics&#x27;.

Today, with the advent of modern genomics, scientists in every branch of biology make use of molecular phylogeny to guide their research. One common method is multiple sequence alignment.

Thomas Cavalier-Smith, G. G. Simpson and Ernst Mayr are some representative evolutionary taxonomists.

== New methods in modern evolutionary systematics ==

Efforts in combining modern methods of cladistics, phylogenetics, and DNA analysis with classical views of taxonomy have recently appeared. Certain authors have found that phylogenetic analysis is acceptable scientifically as long as paraphyly at least for certain groups is allowable. Such a stance is promoted in papers by Tod F. Stuessy and others. A particularly strict form of evolutionary systematics has been presented by Richard H. Zander in a number of papers, but summarized in his &quot;Framework for Post-Phylogenetic Systematics&quot;.

Briefly, Zander&#x27;s pluralistic systematics is based on the incompleteness of each of the theories: A method that cannot falsify a hypothesis is as unscientific as a hypothesis that cannot be falsified. Cladistics generates only trees of shared ancestry, not serial ancestry. Taxa evolving seriatim cannot be dealt with by analyzing shared ancestry with cladistic methods. Hypotheses such as adaptive radiation from a single ancestral taxon cannot be falsified with cladistics. Cladistics offers a way to cluster by trait transformations but no evolutionary tree can be entirely dichotomous. Phylogenetics posits shared ancestral taxa as causal agents for dichotomies yet there is no evidence for the existence of such taxa. Molecular systematics uses DNA sequence data for tracking evolutionary changes, thus paraphyly and sometimes phylogenetic polyphyly signal ancestor-descendant transformations at the taxon level, but otherwise molecular phylogenetics makes no provision for extinct paraphyly. Additional transformational analysis is needed to infer serial descent.

The Besseyan cactus or commagram is the best evolutionary tree for showing both shared and serial ancestry. First, a cladogram or natural key is generated. Generalized ancestral taxa are identified and specialized descendant taxa are noted as coming off the lineage with a line of one color representing the progenitor through time. A Besseyan cactus or commagram is then devised that represents both shared and serial ancestry. Progenitor taxa may have one or more descendant taxa. Support measures in terms of Bayes factors may be given, following Zander&#x27;s method of transformational analysis using decibans.

Cladistic analysis groups taxa by shared traits but incorporates a dichotomous branching model borrowed from phenetics. It is essentially a simplified dichotomous natural key, although reversals are tolerated. The problem, of course, is that evolution is not necessarily dichotomous. An ancestral taxon generating two or more descendants requires a longer, less parsimonious tree. A cladogram node summarizes all traits distal to it, not of any one taxon, and continuity in a cladogram is from node to node, not taxon to taxon. This is not a model of evolution, but is a variant of hierarchical cluster analysis (trait changes and non-ultrametric branches. This is why a tree based solely on shared traits is not called an evolutionary tree but merely a cladistic tree. This tree reflects to a large extent evolutionary relationships through trait transformations but ignores relationships made by species-level transformation of extant taxa.

Phylogenetics attempts to inject a serial element by postulating ad hoc, undemonstrable shared ancestors at each node of a cladistic tree. There are in number, for a fully dichotomous cladogram, one less invisible shared ancestor than the number of terminal taxa. We get, then, in effect a dichotomous natural key with an invisible shared ancestor generating each couplet. This cannot imply a process-based explanation without justification of the dichotomy, and supposition of the shared ancestors as causes. The cladistic form of analysis of evolutionary relationships cannot falsify any genuine evolutionary scenario incorporating serial transformation, according to Zander.

Zander has detailed methods for generating support measures for molecular serial descent and for morphological serial descent using Bayes factors and sequential Bayes analysis through Turing deciban or Shannon informational bit addition.

==The Tree of Life==
As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th century, palaeontologists worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups. The Tree of life was slowly being mapped out, with fossil groups taking up their position in the tree as understanding increased.

These groups still retained their formal Linnaean taxonomic ranks. Some of them are paraphyletic in that, although every organism in the group is linked to a common ancestor by an unbroken chain of intermediate ancestors within the group, some other descendants of that ancestor lie outside the group. The evolution and distribution of the various taxa through time is commonly shown as a &quot;spindle diagram&quot; (often called a &quot;Romerogram&quot; after the American palaeontologist Alfred Romer) where various spindles branch off from each other, with each spindle representing a taxon. The width of the spindles are meant to imply the abundance (often number of families) plotted against time.

Vertebrate palaeontology had mapped out the evolutionary sequence of vertebrates as currently understood fairly well by the closing of the 19th century, followed by a reasonable understanding of the evolutionary sequence of the plant kingdom by the early 20th century. The tying together of the various trees into a grand Tree of Life only really became possible with advancements in microbiology and biochemistry in the period between the World Wars.

== Terminological difference ==
The two approaches, evolutionary taxonomy and the phylogenetic systematics derived from Willi Hennig, differ in the use of the word &quot;monophyletic&quot;. For evolutionary systematicists, &quot;monophyletic&quot; means only that a group is derived from a single common ancestor. In phylogenetic nomenclature, there is an added caveat that the ancestral species and all descendants should be included in the group. The term &quot;holophyletic&quot; has been proposed for the latter meaning. As an example, amphibians are monophyletic under evolutionary taxonomy, since they have arisen from fishes only once. Under phylogenetic taxonomy, amphibians do not constitute a monophyletic group in that the amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals) have evolved from an amphibian ancestor and yet are not considered amphibians. Such paraphyletic groups are rejected in phylogenetic nomenclature, but are considered a signal of serial descent by evolutionary taxonomists.

<doc id="711720" wikidata="Q1092634" url="?curid=711720" title="Boundary (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, the boundary is the perimeter of a playing field. It is also the term given to a scoring shot where the ball is hit to, or beyond, that perimeter, which generally earns four or six runs for the batting team. 

Briefly, if the ball is struck by the batter and rolls or bounces over the boundary (or just touches it) it is known as a &quot;four&quot;, and scores four runs, whereas if it flies over (or touches) the boundary, without touching the ground before that, it is called a &quot;six&quot;, and scores six runs. There are rules covering every possible situation, including the fairly common one when a fielder is in the air beyond the boundary when he or she catches or strikes the ball with his or her hand or another part of the body. 

==Edge of the field==
The boundary is the edge of the playing field, or the physical object (often a rope) marking the edge of the field. In low-level matches, a series of plastic cones or flags are sometimes used. Since the early 2000s, the boundaries at professional matches are often a series of padded cushions carrying sponsors&#x27; logos strung along a rope. If one of these is accidentally moved during play (such as by a fielder sliding into the rope in an attempt to stop the ball) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood. The boundary is at least from the centre of the field in men&#x27;s international cricket, and at least from the centre of the field in women&#x27;s international cricket. 

When the cricket ball is inside the boundary, it is live. When the ball is touching the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a fielder who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is dead and the batting side usually scores four or six runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving often flick the ball back in to the field of play rather than pick it up directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They then return to the field to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler.

A law change in 2010 declared that a fielder could not jump from behind the boundary and, while airborne, parry the ball back on to the field.

==Scoring runs==
A boundary is the scoring of four or six runs from a single delivery, with the ball having left the field, and its first bounce having occurred either entirely within the playing field (in the case of four runs) or not (six runs); these events are known as a four or a six, respectively.

Occasionally, there is an erroneous use of the term boundary as a synonym for a &quot;four&quot;. For example, sometimes commentators say such as &quot;There were seven boundaries and three sixes in the innings.&quot; The correct terminology would be &quot;There were ten boundaries in the innings of which seven were fours and three were sixes.&quot;

When this happens the runs are automatically added to the batsman&#x27;s and his team&#x27;s score and the ball becomes dead. If the ball did not touch the bat or a hand holding the bat, four runs are scored as the relevant type of extra instead; six runs cannot be scored as extras, even if the ball clears the boundary, which is in any case extremely unlikely.

Any runs the batsmen completed by running before the ball reached the edge of the field do not count, unless they are greater than the number of runs that would be scored by the boundary, in which case it is the runs from the boundary that are discounted.
The scoring of a four or six by a good aggressive shot displays a certain amount of mastery by the batsman over the bowler, and is usually greeted by applause from the spectators. Fours resulting from an edged stroke, or from a shot that did not come off as the batsman intended, are considered bad luck to the bowler. As a batsman plays himself in and becomes more confident as his innings progresses, the proportion of his runs scored in boundaries often rises.

An average first-class match usually sees between 50 and 150 boundary fours. Sixes are less common, and usually fewer than 10 (and sometimes none) will be scored in the course of a match.

The Laws allow for captains to change the boundary allowances (number of runs scored through either type of boundary) through a pre-match agreement.

===Four runs===
Four runs are scored if the ball bounces, or rolls along the ground, before touching or going over the edge of the field. If it does not touch the edge of the field, it must touch the ground beyond it. For example, if a batsman hits the ball and it bounces before the boundary and carries over the boundary in flight, a fielder can still bring the ball back into the field of play as long as any part of the fielder&#x27;s body does not touch the ground outside of the boundary.

Four runs are scored as overthrows if a fielder gathers the ball and then throws it so that no other fielder can gather it before it reaches the boundary. In this case, the batsman who hit the ball scores however many runs the batsmen had run up to that time, plus four additional runs, and it is counted as a boundary. If the ball has not come off the bat or hand holding the bat, then the runs are classified as &#x27;extras&#x27; and are added to the team&#x27;s score but not to the score of any individual batsman.

Four runs (or more) can also be scored by hitting the ball into the outfield and running between the wickets. Four runs scored in this way is referred to as an &quot;all run four&quot; and is not counted as a boundary.

=== Six runs ===
Six runs are scored if the ball does not bounce before passing over the boundary in the air, and then touches the boundary or the ground beyond it.

Prior to 1910, six runs were only awarded for hits out of the ground, with custom in Australia to award five runs for clearing the boundary.

==Records==

===Sixes===

The record for most sixes by an individual in a Test match innings is 12, which was first achieved by Pakistani all-rounder Wasim Akram during an innings of 257* against Zimbabwe in October 1996 at Sheikhupura, and was later equalled by Yashasvi Jaiswal during an innings of 214 against England in February 2024 at Rajkot. The One Day International record for most sixes hit in an innings by an individual is held by Eoin Morgan, who hit 17 sixes against Afghanistan at Old Trafford on 18 June 2019 in his innings of 148. Ben Stokes currently holds the record for most sixes in a Test career with 131. Shahid Afridi holds the record for most sixes in an ODI career with 351 sixes in 398 matches.

Although official records for the longest six do not exist due to the difficulties of accurately measuring such distances, there is some evidence to show Australia’s Brett Lee struck a six 130–135 meters against West Indies in a Test match at the Gabba in 2005, although he used a carbon fibre–reinforced bat, which was later banned. 

The record for the most sixes in a Test match is 37, which occurred during a 2019 Test match between India and South Africa in Visakhapatnam.

The record for most sixes in a One Day International is 46, which was achieved in a match between West Indies and England at St George&#x27;s on 27 February 2019. The equivalent record in Twenty20 Internationals was set at Centurion Park, 35 sixes were hit during a match between South Africa and West Indies on 26 March 2023.

In 2012, during the First Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka, West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle became the first player to hit a six off the first ball in a Test cricket match.

===Six or more sixes in an over===
====Six or more sixes in an over in top level domestic cricket====
, this feat has occurred seven times in top level domestic cricket.
====Six sixes in an over in international cricket====
As of August 2024, this feat has occurred six times in international cricket. No batsman has achieved this feat in Tests.

<text>Governmentality is a concept first developed by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, roughly between 1977 and his death in 1984, particularly in his lectures at the Collège de France during this time.

Variously, governmentality can be understood as:

* the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governed
* the &quot;art of government&quot;
* the &quot;how&quot; of governing (that is, the calculated means of directing how we behave and act)
* &quot;governmental rationality&quot;
* &quot;a &#x27;guideline&#x27; for the analysis that Michel Foucault offers by way of historical reconstructions embracing a period starting from Ancient Greece right through to modernity and neo-liberalism&quot;
* &quot;the techniques and strategies by which a society is rendered governable&quot;
* The &quot;reasoned way of governing best and, at the same time, reflection on the best possible way of governing&quot;

Peter Miller, Nikolas Rose and Mitchell Dean, among other scholars, have elaborated on the notion of governmentality.

==Etymology==
This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the &quot;...linking of governing (&quot;gouverner&quot;) and modes of thought (&quot;mentalité&quot;)&quot;.

In fact, it was not coined by uniting words &quot;gouvernement&quot; and &quot;mentalité&quot;, but simply by making &quot;gouvernement&quot; into &quot;gouvernementalité&quot; just like &quot;musical&quot; into &quot;musicalité&quot; [i.e. government + -al- &quot;adjective&quot; + -ité &quot;abstract noun&quot;] (see Michel Senellart&#x27;s &quot;Course Context&quot; in Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Security, territory, population&quot; lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of &quot;governing&quot; or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century. That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, &quot;...&#x27;government&#x27; also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc.&quot; In other words, for our purposes, government is &quot;...the conduct of conduct...&quot;

==Basic definition==

In his lectures at the Collège de France, Foucault often defines governmentality as the &quot;art of government&quot; in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of &quot;government&quot; that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one&#x27;s control of the self to the &quot;biopolitical&quot; control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as biopolitics and power-knowledge. The genealogical exploration of the modern state as &quot;problem of government&quot; does not only deepen Foucault&#x27;s analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault&#x27;s theory of power and his understanding of freedom.

The concept of &quot;governmentality&quot; develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.

&quot;Governmentality&quot; applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to &quot;neoliberal governmentality&quot;, i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in neoliberalism. Because of their active role, individuals need to be regulated from &#x27;inside&#x27;. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (&quot;savoir&quot; in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality:
As Foucault&#x27;s explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful.

We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault&#x27;s definition of governmentality:

This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government&#x27;s means to this end is its &quot;apparatuses of security,&quot; that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting &quot;political economy,&quot; and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, &quot;economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods&quot;. Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends.

The second part of Foucault&#x27;s definition (the &quot;resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs&quot;) presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate.

The next and last part of Foucault&#x27;s definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early Renaissance state, which became more concerned with the &quot;disposing of things&quot;, and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to &quot;render a society governable&quot;.

Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends (&quot;apparatuses of security&quot;), and with a particular type of knowledge (&quot;political economy&quot;), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

==History of the term==
The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault&#x27;s ethical, political and historical thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled &quot;Security, territory and population&quot; (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault&#x27;s course on &quot;The Birth of Biopolitics&quot; at the Collège de France in 1978–1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as &quot;Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Collège de France (1978-1979)&quot; (Paris: Gallimard &amp; Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on neoliberalism and the &quot;Rule of Law&quot;, the &quot;microphysics of power&quot; and also on what Foucault called biopolitics. In the second and third volumes of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, namely, &quot;The Use of Pleasure&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Care of the Self&quot; (1984), and in his lecture on &quot;Technologies of the Self&quot; (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between subjectivation and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including &quot;The Birth of Biopolitics&quot; (1979), &quot;&quot;Omnes et Singulatim&quot;: Towards a Criticism of Political Reason&quot; (1979), &quot;The Subject and Power&quot; (1982) and &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary social orders, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of &quot;governmentality&quot;.

The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with governance) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book &quot;The Foucault Effect&quot; (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault&#x27;s 1978 short text on &quot;gouvernementalité&quot;.

==Further developments of the concept==
Hunt and Wickham, in their work &quot;Foucault and Law&quot; [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault&#x27;s work. They state, &quot;governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms&quot; [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts &#x27;governmental&#x27; and &#x27;–ity&#x27; - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix –ity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault&#x27;s finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault&#x27;s ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences&quot; [1994:77].

Kerr&#x27;s approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of &quot;governmental rationality&quot; [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not &quot;a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule&quot; [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense.

Dean&#x27;s understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham&#x27;s, and Kerr&#x27;s approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham&#x27;s approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: &quot;Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts...&quot; [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12].

Dean&#x27;s main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into &#x27;govern&#x27; &#x27;mentality&#x27;, or mentalities of governing—mentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a &quot;collective activity&quot; [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually &quot;examined by those who inhabit it&quot; [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted—that the same activity in which they engage in &quot;can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it&quot; [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality—its reflexivity. He explains:
&quot;On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of producing truth. [1999:18]&quot;

By drawing attention to the &#x27;how and why&#x27;, Dean connects &quot;technologies of power&quot; [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault&#x27;s intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any &quot;conduct of conduct&quot; [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood &quot;from within its own perspective&quot; [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society&#x27;s culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others.

The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power.

===Mentality of rule===
A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is &#x27;rationalised&#x27; [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. Fukuyama [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes &quot;a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty&quot;. However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government &quot;is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality&quot; [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely &#x27;free to choose&#x27; but obliged to be free, &quot;to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice&quot; [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

=== From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography ===

==== Governmentality and cartography ====
Cartographic mapping has historically been a key strategy of governmentality. Harley, drawing on Foucault, affirms that State-produced maps &quot;extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power&quot;. Typically, State-led mapping conforms to Bentham&#x27;s concept of a panopticon, in which &#x27;the one views the many&#x27;. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power.

==== Neoliberal governmentality and cartography ====
Through processes of neoliberalism, the State has &quot;hollowed out&quot; some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical scale. &#x27;People&#x27;s cartography&#x27; is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial governance than traditional State-distribution of cartographic knowledge. Thus subverting Harley&#x27;s theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful. Joyce challenges Foucauldian notions of Panopticism, contending that neoliberal governmentality is more adequately conceptualised by an omniopticon - &#x27;the many surveilling the many&#x27;. Collaborative mapping initiatives utilising GPS technology are arguably omniopticons, with the ability to reverse the panoptic gaze.

===Self-governing capabilities===
Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and autonomy. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one&#x27;s everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of political power, but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155].

These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power.

===Technologies of power===
Technologies of power are those &quot;technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones&quot; [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.

====Technologies of the self====
Technologies of the self refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can &quot;mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect&quot; [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds &quot;subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts&quot; [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through &quot;inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88].

The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem.

====Responsibilisation====
In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, public safety etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of &#x27;self-care&#x27; [Lemke, 2001:201] and of &#x27;consumption&#x27;. The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.

====Healthism====
Healthism links the &quot;public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being&quot; [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather &quot;individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health&quot; [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable.

====Normalisation====
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of normalisation. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that &quot;which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable&quot;. The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of shame. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this &#x27;normality&#x27;. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism.

====Self-esteem====
Self-esteem is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves. The &#x27;self-esteem&#x27; approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. &#x27;Self-esteem&#x27; thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal &#x27;empowerment&#x27; to collective yardsticks. These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self-esteem is a technology of self for &quot;evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so&quot;. By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely consumption. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual.

====Technologies of the market====
The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of identity through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product. We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire.

The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities. Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people&#x27;s opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity.

These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself. If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self-government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism. Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals.

===Ecogovernmentality===
Ecogovernmentality (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault&#x27;s concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.

Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how government agencies, in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct &quot;The Environment.&quot; This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government&#x27;s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

===Crises of governmentality===
According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, &quot;liberal art of government&quot; enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of risk or danger) necessitates actions &quot;which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite.&quot;

The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as:

# Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding &quot;degeneration&quot;.
# Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual&#x27;s behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham&#x27;s Panopticon surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices &quot;irregularities.&quot;
# Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply &quot;counterweighted&quot; by it.

Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the Keynesian welfare state under F.D. Roosevelt, the thought of the German liberals in the Freiburg school, and the thought of American libertarian economists such as the Chicago School which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models.

These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation that leads to a &quot;legal strait-jacket&quot; for the state, local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state. and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.

=== Application to health care ===

Scholars have recently suggested that the concept of governmentality may be useful in explaining the operation of evidence-based health care and the internalization of clinical guidelines relating to best practice for patient populations, such as those developed by the American Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Research has also explored potential micro-level resistance to governmentality in health care and how governmentally is enacted into health care practice, drawing on Foucault&#x27;s notion of pastoral power. 

===Beyond the West===
Jeffreys and Sigley (2009) highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts. Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault&#x27;s concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China&#x27;s approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of &#x27;Chinese governmentally&#x27; is based not on the notion of &#x27;freedom and liberty&#x27; as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration. Another well-known study is Li (2007), an account of development in action. Focusing on attempts to improve landscapes and livelihoods in Indonesia, Li exposes the practices that enable experts to diagnose problems and devise interventions, and the agency of people whose conduct is targeted for reform. Katomero (2017) also employs governmentality in a development context, this time to describe accountability practices in the water supply sector in Tanzania. Such new studies thus use Foucault&#x27;s Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non-western contexts. Conversely, some studies illustrate that in societies that are influenced by global capitalism the model of governmentality is limited to specific spaces and practices rather than dictating a wholesome ethos of citizenship. For example, in China people who practice “self-cultivation” through various educational programs in psychology or communication skills often treat these activities as a place where they can perform individualistic personalities in contrast to their ordinary social responsibilities. Moreover, these activities may be oriented at promoting social change as much as they aim to regulate the capacities of the self.

<text>Fabian Crisologo Ver (born Fabian Maria Trinidad Juan Cirilo Crisologo Ver; January 20, 1920 – November 21, 1998) was a Filipino military officer who served as the Commanding Officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos.

==Early life and education==
Fabian Ver was born on January 20, 1920, to Juan Ver and Elena Crisologo. He grew up in the town of Sarrat in Ilocos Norte.

Ver attended the University of the Philippines and was an alumnus of its reserve program. He also joined the UP Vanguard in 1941. However, the outbreak of World War II disrupted his studies. After the war, he resumed his studies at the University of Manila where he obtained a Bachelor of Law degree and later the University of Louisville where he graduated with a degree in police administration in 1963. He also undertook training in Hawaii and with the Los Angeles Police Department.

==Military and political career==

During World War II, he acted as a guerrilla intelligence officer with the rank of third lieutenant and after the war, he went on in the military service. During Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; term as Senate President in the early 1960s, he was one of his military advisers. He was at
that time serving in the Criminal Investigation Service of the Philippine Constabulary with the rank of captain.

The Philippine Constabulary, now the Philippine National Police, was at that time, a major service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines that deallt with law enforcement
and peace and order in the country.

Ver was described by former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in his autobiography as a man of Marcos through and through. He could not and would not say no to Marcos and would blindly carry out the wishes and orders of Marcos without question. Thus, he became the most loyal officer to Marcos and upon the latter&#x27;s election as President of the Philippines in 1965, he became part of the latter&#x27;s inner circle. Ver then worked his way up through the military ranks.

Ver was the most trusted military officer of then President Ferdinand Marcos as Martial Law was declared on September 21, 1972, was also known as one of Marcos&#x27; chief enforcers, and was said to be the highest among the Rolex 12 group of people privy to the inner workings of Martial Law.

He became further fiercely loyal to Marcos, who rewarded him by appointing him as the commanding general of the Presidential Security Group, then known as the Presidential Security Command or PSC that was tasked to secure Marcos and his family. When he was due for retirement in 1976, Marcos extended his term indefinitely. He also headed the then National Intelligence and Security Authority or NISA (now the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency), the vast and well-armed and well-equipped intelligence department of the Philippines, sending government agents to search for anti-Marcos critics. It placed spies in all government and private entities. In effect, NISA acted as secret police force of the Marcos regime. And since NISA was under the direct control of the Office of the President, Ver directly reported to Marcos. And under the 1978 National Security Code, NISA also was given functional supervision and control over the Intelligence Service of the AFP or ISAFP, thus its chief also reported to Ver directly, thus widening his powers in the military gaining full suzerainty of the ISAFP to further NISA&#x27;s functions. In a 1997 documentary, General Romeo Espino, former chief of staff of the AFP said Ver was a powerful man and who checked his recommendations for promotions and appointments before it reached Marcos. And, if Ver decided to release any political prisoner detained by NISA, it equalled that of Marcos as his signature was also considered as the latter&#x27;s. 
Martial law was lifted in 1981, and Ver was appointed Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines over a cousin, then Major-General Fidel Valdez Ramos, the chief of the Philippine Constabulary. Thus, Ver became the most powerful officer in the military, as he headed now three institutions: the entire AFP, the PSC and NISA. Police officials, military men, businessmen, politicians, bureaucrats and other prominent figures kowtowed to him.

Ver was well-feared due to his direct access to Marcos as well as then First Lady Imelda Marcos. In fact, his three sons, who followed his footsteps also saw stellar careers. His eldest son, Irwin was rapidly promoted to colonel and named chief of staff of the Presidential Security Command. His other son, Rexor was the chief of the close- in security of Marcos and his youngest son, Wyrlo, was the commander of the Armored Unit of Malacanang Palace. Irwin Ver graduated no. 1 in the Philippine Military Academy in 1970. During Ver&#x27;s term as AFP chief of staff, he was biased in favor of the military officers that came from ROTC program by giving them incentives and named them to key important posts in the military, thus, this made the military officers who graduated from the Philippine Military Academy resentful, with some officers forming a faction called Reform the Armed Forces Movement led by Col. Gregorio Honasan, Victor Batac, &amp; Eduardo &quot;Red&quot; Kapunan who all graduated in the academy in 1971. He also extended schooling privileges to his relatives, friends in the military especially the graduates of professional military schools that were close to him, to the Marcoses, including those who paid homage to him and filled the high 
posts in the military with Ilocano ROTC-trained military officers. This
led to the era of favoritism and Ilocanization in the AFP. General Romeo Espino, Ver&#x27;s predecessor, was AFP Chief of Staff for the longest term in the Philippines military, was like Ver, Espino was also an ROTC graduate in the University of the Philippines, but was regarded as fair in administration of military affairs during his time, unlike Ver.

Ver also instituted, along with Marcos, the extension of services in the military of those military officers loyal to them, who overreached their retirement age.

As Marcos disregarded the authority of then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in the 1980s, he changed the military chain of command. Under the new chain of command, the authority would evolve from Marcos as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces up to Ver, the chief of staff of the armed forces.

As such, Ver replaced Enrile as the second most-powerful high government official in the country, the status which the latter held during martial law when he was tasked to administer it.

==Aquino assassination and acquittal by Marcos==
Ver kept aging officers loyal to himself and also to Marcos on the armed forces, thus making young officers disgruntled. The Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) was formed by these young officers, led by then Colonel Gregorio Honasan and then Captain Proceso Maligalig as a result of this. The RAMboys, as they were known in the Philippines, played a key role in Marcos&#x27; overthrow. As the Marcos regime grew unpopular during these years, Marcos would be in and out of office due to kidney ailments. Political mismanagement ensued, culminating with the 1983 assassination of popular opposition leader and senator Benigno Aquino Jr. upon his return from exile in the United States. The Agrava Commission, an independent fact-finding body put up by Marcos, found evidence to verify that the military and Ver were involved, but he was subsequently acquitted in 1985 by the Sandiganbayan. After the tumultuous snap election on February 7, 1986, Marcos announced that he was replacing Ver with Fidel Ramos due to his alleged ties with Ninoy Aquino&#x27;s assassination, although he tacitly kept Ver in power.

==Later life and death==
After the tumultuous snap elections of 1986, the First EDSA Revolution broke out. During a television conference, Ver insistently advised Marcos to give him orders to fire on the swelling number of protesters, but Marcos refused to and gave the order to disperse the crowd without shooting. 

Following the Revolution, Ver and his family along with the Marcoses were exiled to Hawaii. Facing federal racketeering charges, Ver left the United States using a Paraguayan passport, and transited to Austria, then finally to Mannheim, Germany where he joined his younger children. He was not allowed to return to the country during the administration of Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos. He returned during the presidency of Joseph Estrada but faced lawsuits that linked him to the assassination of Ninoy Aquino and fall guy Rolando Galman.

On November 21, 1998, Ver died of pulmonary complications in a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, two months before his 79th birthday.

== In popular culture ==
Ver was played by Mervyn Samson in the 1988 television film &quot;A Dangerous Life&quot; and by Robin Padilla in the 2022 movie &quot;Maid in Malacañang&quot;.

<doc id="711738" wikidata="Q2053913" url="?curid=711738" title="ǂʼAmkoe language">
<text>ǂʼAmkoe , formerly called by the dialectal name ǂHoan (Eastern ǂHȍã, ǂHûân, ǂHua, ǂHû, or in native orthography ), is a severely endangered Kxʼa language of Botswana. West ǂʼAmkoe dialect, along with Taa (or perhaps the Tsaasi dialect of Taa) and Gǀui, form the core of the Kalahari Basin sprachbund, and share a number of characteristic features, including the largest consonant inventories in the world. ǂʼAmkoe was shown to be related to the Juu languages by Honken and Heine (2010), and these have since been classified together in the Kxʼa language family.

==Language situation==
ǂʼAmkoe is moribund and severely endangered. There are only a few dozen native speakers, most born before 1960 (one Sasi speaker was born in 1971, one Nǃaqriaxe speaker in 1969), many of whom no longer speak the language fluently. The first language of the younger generations, and even of many older, native speakers who no longer speak ǂʼAmkoe well, is Gǀui, a Khoe language, in the case of Nǃaqriaxe; Kgalagadi, a Bantu language that is the local lingua franca, in the case of ǂHoan; and the Ngwato dialect of Tswana, in the case of Sasi.

==Dialects==
ǂʼAmkoe () is spoken in three areas in southeastern Botswana, corresponding to three dialects. Recent surveys found the following locations: 
*Nǃaqriaxe () is spoken in the west of Kweneng District, in the villages of Motokwe, Khekhenye, Tswane, and Dutlwe.
*ǂHoan () is spoken in eastern Kweneng, in the villages of Salajwe, Mathibatsela, and Shorilatholo.
*Sasi ( or ) is spoken further east, between Kweneng District and the South African border, in the villages of Dibete, Poloka, and a few nearby villages not found on maps.
Nǃaqriaxe and ǂHoan are closest, collectively referred to as West ǂʼAmkoe; Sasi is referred to as East ǂʼAmkoe.

There are some phonological differences between the Nǃaqriaxe spoken around Dutlwe and that spoken around Motokwe and Khekhenye. Sasi is a &quot;mutually intelligible language&quot; with differences in phonology and lexicon. There have been no systematic studies of Sasi, in 2015, Collins was engaged in fieldwork. The East and West populations had no knowledge of each other, but when brought together in 1996, they were able to communicate, and found the differences amusing.

Recent scholars such as Collins, Gruber, Köhler, and Güldemann restrict the name &quot;ǂHoan&quot; to the ǂHoan dialect, and call the language as a whole &quot;ǂʼAmkoe,&quot; which means &quot;person&quot; in all dialects. Almost all linguistic work has been on the ǂHoan and Nǃaqriaxe dialects.

ǂHoan has gone by the names and spellings &quot;Eastern ǂHoan, ǂHùã, ǂHũa, ǂHṍã, ǂHoang de Dutlwe&quot;. It has been specified as &quot;Eastern ǂHoan&quot; to distinguish it from Western ǂHuan, a dialect of the unrelated Taa language. Sasi has gone by &quot;Sàsí, Tshasi, Tshasi de Khutse&quot;. is a Tswana name that is more precise than the generic &quot;Masarwa&quot; &quot;Bushman&quot;. The disambiguator &quot;de Khutse&quot; is used to distinguish it from a variety of Taa also called &quot;Tshase&quot; and &quot;Sase&quot;. The name of the third dialect is () or () in ǂʼAmkoe.

All Nǃaqriaxe speakers are bilingual in Gǀui, with some Kgalagadi as well. ǂHoan speakers are bilingual in Kgalagadi, and Sasi speakers in the Ngwato dialect of Tswana. The ǂʼAmkoe language shows evidence that it previously had extensive contact with Taa. Superimposed on this are Gǀui features such as a shift of alveolar consonants to palatal, even in ǂHoan, which is not currently in contact with Gǀui.

==Phonology==

ǂʼAmkoe has bilabial clicks, which are found in only two other living languages. It has been in intense contact with Gǀui and previously with Taa, and some of the sounds of ǂʼAmkoe appear to have been borrowed from Gǀui. On the other hand, the moribund state of the language is apparent in its phonology, and sounds not found in Gǀui appear to have been lost by many of the remaining speakers.

===Vowels===
Nǃaqriaxe vowel qualities are . The front vowels, , are very similar in formant space, as are even more so the back vowels, , but minimal pairs distinguish them. Vowels may be nasalized, pharyngealized (written with a final in the practical orthography), or glottalized. Gerlach (2015) treats long vowels as sequences, in which the nasalized vowels, , occur phonemically only as V2, while the pharyngealized and glottalized vowels, and (and, in one loan word, ) occur only as V1. A vowel at V1 will be phonetically nasalized if V2 is nasal, though combinations of glottalized or pharyngealized plus nasalized vowels are not common. Some speakers glottalize pharyngeal vowels, but inconsistently, and it does not appear to be distinctive. Breathy vowels occur after aspirated consonants and with some speakers at the ends of utterances. Neither case is phonemic. They may also occur on some words with low tone. Not all words with low tone are attested with breathy vowels, but the feature does not appear to be distinctive (there are no minimal pairs), and so Gerlach (2015) does not treat breathy vowels as phonemic. is a diphthong before final (that is, in words of the shape &quot;Com&quot;), but it carries only a single tone, and so is analyzed as an allophone of a single vowel. This diphthongization occurs in all three dialects, and also in Gǀui, which probably got it from ǂʼAmkoe.

Honken (2013), which is based on Gruber (1973), says the ǂHȍã qualities, also , may be modal, breathy, laryngealized, or pharyngealized, and that all may be nasalized.

In words of the shape CVV, attested vowel sequences (considering only vowel quality) are aa, ee, ii, oo, uu, ai, ui, eo, oa, ua. Basically, vowel one is normally /a/ or /o/; an /o/ becomes /u/ before a high vowel two (such as /i/), while an /a/ becomes /e/ or /i/ consonant one is dental/palatal or if vowel two is high. These patterns may be an influence of ǀGui (Honken 2013).

===Tone===
Tone in ǂʼAmkoe shows acoustic characteristics of both neighbouring consonants and vowel phonation. Gerlach (2015) analyzes Nǃaqriaxe as having three phonemic tones: low (L), mid (M), and high (H). Monosyllabic words with CVV, CVN shapes have two tones. In disyllabic words of CV.CV shape, six tone combinations are found: a word may have a mid tone or go up or down between adjacent tones, but L.H and H.L are not attested, and the only falling tone is ML. All syllable-final tones in Gerlach&#x27;s data are falling, perhaps an effect of utterance-final prosody. The system is very similar to that of Gǀui, Gerlach&#x27;s analysis was based on data from a single speaker who speaks more Gǀui than ǂʼAmkoe and who lacks ǂʼAmkoe consonants not found in Gǀui, so it&#x27;s not clear that the results are representative of ǂʼAmkoe as a whole.

The tones analyzed as rising phonemically are phonetically dipping (falling-rising). Voiced and aspirated consonants are tone depressors, with high tone at the level of mid after a tenuis or glottalized consonant, and mid at the level of low. (However, the endpoint of low&gt;mid tone does not change, and so effectively becomes low&gt;high.) Aspirated consonants (and especially delayed-aspirated clicks) have an additional depressive effect at the beginning of the tone, so that they are phonetically rising; the contour, however, is a sharp rise at the beginning, rather than the slow descent with a sharp rise at the end of the phonemically rising tones.

Collins (2012) describes six word tones for ǂHȍã dialect: extra high, high-mid (high level), mid-low (mid level), high-low, low-mid, and low level. The extra high tones mostly occurs on high vowels, , which have an allophonic pitch-raising effect, whereas low level occurs after voiced consonants, which have a tone depressor effect. Given that Collins did not control for initial consonants in his analysis, his description is consistent with Gerlach&#x27;s for Nǃaqriaxe dialect.

===Consonants===
Gerlach (2012) reports different consonant inventories for different speakers of Nǃaqriaxe dialect: A smaller one, similar to that of the neighboring Gǀui language and to previous accounts, is used by most speakers, including those who speak more Gǀui than ǂʼAmkoe. A larger inventory is believed to be more conservative, with pre-voiced consonants cognate to those of the related Ju languages and therefore perhaps dating back to proto-Kxʼa, but lost under Gǀui influence as the language became moribund. (These additional consonants are shaded in the table below.) Similar consonants are found in the neighboring Taa language; it is not clear if they date to proto-Tuu, and perhaps an earlier era of contact, or if Taa might have gotten them from ǂʼAmkoe.

The egressive consonants found in word-initial (C1) position in lexical words are as follows. Those in parentheses are only found in loan words. Those with a shaded background are only used by speakers Gerlach (2015) believes are conservative:

The shaded consonants have a voiced hold and voiceless release, . Gerlach (2015) analyses the change of voicing as being a phonetic detail due to the nature of the release rather than being phonemically prevoiced. The post-alveolar affricates ( etc.) are conflated with the alveolar affricates ( etc.) in Nǃaqriaxe dialect. They are probably an old distinction that&#x27;s been lost in Nǃaqriaxe. Where they do occur, they may be alveolo-palatal (, etc.), depending on speaker and location. appear to be only found in Gǀui loans. Sasi has rather than the of ǂHoan and Nǃaqriaxe, though Sasi is sometimes slightly affricated. (The same pattern holds for Sasi contour clicks with .) A contrastive was reported by Gruber (1975) from a word or two in ǂHoan dialect, but could not be confirmed in Nǃaqriaxe, and cross-linguistic comparison gives reason to believe that and are the same consonant.

 frequently appears as a fricative ( or further back). and have a slightly fricated release, or etc., and aspirated is distinguished primarily in the frication being longer than for . () is similar, and might be better analyzed as . It is sometimes pronounced as a lateral , though not as commonly as in Gǀui. is not found in many lexical words apart from loans, but does occur in some highly frequent grammatical words. is rare, and may be restricted to loans (this is not yet clear). Glottal stop could be argued to be epenthetic on an onsetless syllable rather than phonemic.

Consonants found in word-medial (C2) position are (often ), ; the phonemic status of medial in one word is unclear. is rare, found word-finally in a few loanwords. An additional consonant, , is found as the first consonant of some grammatical markers.

The palatal series, which is most developed in ǂHȍã dialect, derive historically from dental consonants. This appears to be a regional influence from Gǀui, where it has also happened in some dialects more than other. Among ǂʼAmkoe dialects, there has been no palatalization in Sisa (), palatalization of most alveolar consonants in Nǃaqriaxe (), and full palatalization in ǂHoan (). The shift of only took place in lexical words; in grammatical words, only is found.

/h/ is frequently a voiced (murmured) , and has been described as being &quot;absorbed&quot; into the following vowel.

====Clicks====
Like the Tuu languages, with which it was previously classified, ǂʼAmkoe has five click &quot;types&quot;: bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal, and lateral alveolar. There are 14 to 19 &quot;accompaniments&quot; (combinations of manner, phonation, and contour), depending on the speaker. As with non-clicks, the difference is in whether the speaker retains pre-voiced clicks like those found in the Ju languages and Taa. The result is 68 to 77 click consonants. (Theoretically, the numbers may be 70 and 95, as several clicks shown here were unattested in Gerlach 2012 but have since proven to be accidental gaps, and some or all of the gaps below are likely to be accidental as well. This is especially so considering that the pre-voiced clicks are attested from only a single speaker, for whom extensive data is not available, and that the delayed-aspirated series has not been reported from ǂHoan.) Gerlach (2015) finds the following inventory, considering Nǃaqriaxe and ǂHoan dialects:

The unusual distinction between glottalized and ejective clicks is similar to that found in Gǀui. A near minimal set is &#x27;warm&#x27;, &#x27;hard&#x27;, &#x27;to stink&#x27;. It has not been reported from ǂHoan, but this is likely to have been an oversight. The ejective clicks are not prenasalized between vowels, while the glottalized clicks, and clicks with delayed aspiration, are. Voicing of the voiced uvular clicks is variable. They are sporadically prenasalized, even in initial position, which many investigators believe is due to the difficulty of maintaining the voicing.

Like etc. above, the plain click affricates appear to be found only in Gǀui loans.

With the voiceless aspirated clicks, voicing starts partway through the aspiration, , so the voice-onset time is not as long as that of the glottalized clicks. With the voiced aspirated clicks, the aspiration is generally voiced throughout, but voicing decreases during the hold of the click, and the release itself is voiceless, unlike the release of modally voiced clicks. (That is, these are better described as pre-voiced aspirated clicks.) For the clicks with delayed aspiration, the aspiration is quite long, starting out weak and increasing in intensity with time (unlike the aspiration of the simple aspirated clicks, which starts out strong and decreases in intensity). When the click is in utterance-initial position, there is no voicing in the hold or in the aspiration. However, when the click occurs after a vowel, it is nasal throughout the hold, ending just before the release, but with voicing continuing though the release and throughout the aspiration: vs . The preglottalized clicks have a much shorter voice lead (negative VOT) than the plain nasal clicks, sometimes hardly audible.

===Phonotactics===
A lexical word is typically of the shapes CVV (69% in Nǃaqriaxe dialect), CVN (8%), or CVCV (22%, often loans from Gǀui), with two tone-bearing units. (Only 1% of words are CVCVCV, CVVCV, CVVVCV, and other complex patterns.) The N may only be in native words, though final occurs in loans. Gerlach (2015) believes that the CVV and CVN patterns derive historically from *CVCV through loss of C2 (such as a medial in related languages) or V2 in all cases, not just those that can be shown.

In lexical words, most consonants occur in C1 position, but only occur in C2 position. may be realized as or , and may be realized as . (A few words have a third-position consonant, CVCVCV or CVVCV. These include , and may be a fossilized suffixes.) ? occurs as C2 in one word, &#x27;bag&#x27;, but its analysis is uncertain - the word may be , with a CVVV structure, and perhaps a loan. do not occur in C1 position except in loanwords. Initial may be a trill when it is a trill in the source language. occurs as C1 in only a few native words, (C1 only) is rare, and final is only found in loans. does not occur in lexical words, except for some speakers as the realization of .

In grammatical words, the word shape is usually CV, sometimes CVV (generally shortening to CV in rapid speech), or, in two cases, N (both and ). Attested consonants in grammatical words are . Of these, do not occur as C1 in lexical words, while are rare. Thus there is a strong tendency for some consonants to mark the beginning of a lexical word, and for others to start grammatical words. (Though may be realized as and might be phonemically .) In grammatical words, clicks are mostly found in CVV and CVq (pharyngealized) syllables, though there is a plural suffix . is sometimes pharyngealized to in suffixes. At least occur as C2 in loan words.

==Grammar==

ǂHõã is an SVO subject–verb–object language (see examples in Collins 2001, 2002, 2003). The SVO word order of ǂHõã typical of the Kxʼa and Tuu language families. ǂHõã has nominal postpositions used for locative relations (see Collins 2001), and the possessor precedes the head noun.

ǂHõã grammar is characterized by a number of features common to the Kxʼa and Tuu languages. First there is an intricate system of nominal plurality and verbal pluractionality. Second, there is a system of verbal compounds. Third, there is a general-purpose preposition (referred to as the &quot;linker&quot; in Collins 2003) which appears between post-verbal constituents.

<text>Patrick Galen Dempsey (born January 13, 1966) is an American actor and racing driver. He is best known for his role as neurosurgeon Dr. Derek &quot;McDreamy&quot; Shepherd in the ABC medical drama series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2005–2015; 2020–2021). He is also known for his leading man romantic films roles, including in &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007). Dempsey has received nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards, and was named as &quot;People&#x27;s&quot; Sexiest Man Alive in 2023.

Dempsey started his career acting in films such as &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; (1987) and &quot;Loverboy&quot; (1989). He has since starred in several romantic comedy films such as &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002), &quot;Made of Honor&quot; (2008), &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), and &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot; (2016). Dempsey has also taken dramatic roles in &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995), &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), &quot;Freedom Writers&quot; (2007), &quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; (2023), and &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2023). He starred in and produced &quot;Flypaper&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Art of Racing in the Rain&quot; (2019).

Dempsey, who maintains a sports car and vintage car collection, enjoys auto racing in his spare time. He has competed in events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car races, and the Ensenada SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. Prior to the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey declared that he would &quot;walk away&quot; from acting if he could and dedicate himself full-time to motorsports.

==Early life==
Dempsey was born in Lewiston, Maine, and grew up in the nearby towns of Turner and Buckfield. He has two older sisters. His mother, Amanda (née Casson), was a school secretary, and his father, William, was an insurance salesman.

He attended Leavitt Area High School, Buckfield High School and St. Dominic Regional High School, and after moving to Houston attended Willowridge High School.

In his youth, Dempsey participated in juggling competitions. In 1981, he achieved second place at the International Jugglers&#x27; Association Championship in the Juniors category, just behind Anthony Gatto, who is considered to be the best technical juggler of all time.

Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 12. He told Barbara Walters on her 2008 Oscar special that he thinks dyslexia made him what he is today. &quot;It&#x27;s given me a perspective of — you have to keep working,&quot; Dempsey told Walters. &quot;I have never given up.&quot;

==Acting career==

===1984–1989: Early roles and breakthrough ===
An invitation to audition for a role in the stage production of &quot;Torch Song Trilogy&quot; led to Patrick Dempsey&#x27;s discovery as an actor. His audition was successful and he spent the following four months touring with the company in Philadelphia. He followed this with another tour, &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;, in the lead role, which was directed by Gene Saks. Dempsey has also made notable appearances in the stage productions of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, with the Maine Acting Company, and as Timmy (the Martin Sheen role) in a 1990 off-Broadway revival of &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; co-starring with John Mahoney and Dana Ivey at the Roundabout Theatre in New York.

Dempsey&#x27;s first major feature film role was at age 21 with Beverly D&#x27;Angelo in the film &quot;In The Mood&quot;, the actual World War II story about Ellsworth Wisecarver whose relationships with older married women created a national uproar. He then co-starred in the third installment of the comedy classic &quot;Meatballs III: Summer Job&quot;, alongside Sally Kellerman in 1987. This was followed by the teen comedy &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; in 1987 with actress Amanda Peterson and &quot;Some Girls&quot; with Jennifer Connelly in 1988. In 1989, Dempsey had the lead role in the films &quot;Loverboy&quot; with actress Kirstie Alley and &quot;Happy Together&quot; with actress Helen Slater.

===1990–2004: Established actor ===

Dempsey made several featured appearances in television in the 1990s; he was cast several times in pilots that were not picked up for a full season, including lead roles in the TV versions of the films &quot;The Player&quot; and &quot;About A Boy&quot;. He received positive reviews, however, as he portrayed real-life mob boss, Meyer Lansky in 1991 when &quot;Mobsters&quot; was put on the screen. His first major television role was a three-episode stint as Will Truman&#x27;s closeted sportscaster boyfriend on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. He appeared in four episodes of &quot;Once &amp; Again&quot; as Aaron Brooks, the schizophrenic brother of Lily (Sela Ward). Dempsey received an Emmy nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for the role of Aaron. In 1993, he played a young John F. Kennedy in the two-part TV mini-series &quot;&quot;. In 2000, he played Detective Kincaid in &quot;Scream 3&quot;.

Dempsey had a high-profile role as the fiancé of Reese Witherspoon&#x27;s character in &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (2002). In 2004, he co-starred in the highly acclaimed HBO production &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot;, opposite Hilary Swank and Anjelica Huston. He also appeared as special guest star in &quot;The Practice&quot; for its three-episode finale season (8x13-8x15).

===2005–2015: Stardom and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;===

Dempsey has received significant public attention for his role as Dr. Derek &quot;McDreamy&quot; Shepherd in the medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; opposite Ellen Pompeo. Before landing the role, Dempsey auditioned for the role of Dr. Chase on another medical show, &quot;House&quot;. He also appeared in two episodes of the later &quot;Grey&quot;&quot;&#x27;s&quot; spinoff &quot;Private Practice&quot;, playing the same character of Dr. Shepherd. The relationship his character had with Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) on screen has received a lot of praise and positive reactions.

In 2007, Dempsey starred in the Disney film &quot;Enchanted&quot;, and the Paramount Pictures film &quot;Freedom Writers&quot;, where he reunited with his &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot; co-star Hilary Swank. He also voiced the character Kenai in &quot;Brother Bear&quot; sequel &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot;, replacing Joaquin Phoenix. Other roles Dempsey appeared in during this time include the 2008 film &quot;Made of Honor&quot; as Tom, and the 2010 romantic comedy &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;; the latter film follows five interconnecting stories about Los Angelinos anticipating (or in some cases dreading) the holiday of love. Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the prize-winning novel &quot;The Art of Racing in the Rain&quot; in July 2009, for Dempsey to star in. The film instead starred Milo Ventimiglia. He starred as Dylan Gould in &quot;&quot; (2011).

In January 2014, he signed a two-year contract to remain on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, then in its tenth season, that would ensure his participation for potential 11th and 12th seasons. Dempsey was nominated for Best Actor – Television Series Drama at the 2006 Golden Globe Awards for the role. His success on the show has led to his becoming a spokesman for Mazda and State Farm Insurance. BuddyTV ranked him #1 on its list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Sexiest Men of 2011&quot;. In November 2020, Dempsey appeared as Derek Shepherd at the start of the series&#x27; 17th season for the first time since the character had died in April 2015.

===2016–present ===
Following his departure from &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, Dempsey was working on two small-screen projects: a drama &quot;The Limit&quot; for SundanceTV and a travelogue spy thriller called &quot;Fodors&quot;. He said: 

In 2016, Dempsey starred in the Universal Pictures film &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot; with Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth, and in 2018 he appeared on Epix television miniseries &quot;The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair&quot;. In 2017 he participated in the short film &quot;Red Nose Day Actually&quot;, a sequel to the 2003 romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot;. Dempsey played the role of the husband of Laura Linney&#x27;s character Sarah. Starting from 2020 he has portrayed Harry Morgan in the Sky Atlantic financial thriller series &quot;Devils&quot;. On February 4, 2020, Dempsey signed on to star as the lead of a CBS political drama pilot &quot;Ways &amp; Means&quot;, where he would portray a Congressional leader. Initially planned to be considered for the 2020-21 televisions season, the pilot was rolled into consideration for the following season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CBS ultimately passed on the finished pilot in May 2021. In January 2021, it was announced that Dempsey would reprise his role in the &quot;Enchanted&quot; sequel, &quot;Disenchanted&quot;, which began production in spring of that year. The film was released on Disney+ in late 2022. In 2023, he portrayed Sheriff Eric Newlon in the slasher film &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; and Piero Taruffi in the biographical sports drama &quot;Ferrari&quot; directed by Michael Mann.

==Auto racing==

In 2014, Dempsey told Reuters in the Hockenheimring support paddock at the German Grand Prix that motor racing was not just a hobby, and had become as much a part of who he is as acting. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s all-consuming in many ways. I couldn&#x27;t imagine not racing right now. It really keeps me motivated. It&#x27;s all I think about on a daily basis.&quot;

Dempsey, who maintains an extensive sports and vintage car collection, has enjoyed auto racing in his spare time for several years. Before the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2013, he said that he would like to compete full-time, telling Eurosport:
I would like to make that [motorsports] a complete priority and just focus on this full-time. If I could just walk away from acting, I think I could do that very easily, and just focus on the driving, I would love that more than anything else.
He has competed in prestigious events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans and Rolex 24 at Daytona sports car races, and the Tecate SCORE Baja 1000 off-road race. He was a co-owner of the Vision Racing IndyCar Series team and current owner of Dempsey Racing, which is presently racing two Porsche 911 GT America&#x27;s in the Tudor United Sports Car Series. He participated in this series as often as his schedule allowed, although insurance restrictions kept him from driving competitively while also filming a motion picture. In 2009, he raced a Team Seattle Advanced Engineering Ferrari F430 GT in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans&#x27;s GT2 class and finished ninth in class.

Dempsey announced he would race the 2011 Rolex 24 at Daytona along with other races throughout the season in a Mazda RX-8. Dempsey finished in third place in the GT Class of the Rolex 24 at Daytona. In 2012, Dempsey competed in the Grand-Am Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge behind the wheel of an Aston Martin Racing-Multimatic Motorsports Aston Martin Vantage GT4, which, after five successful racing seasons in Europe, was to make its debut on American tracks. He formed the Dempsey Racing team to compete in the American Le Mans Series. The team fielded a full-time Oreca FLM09 in the Prototype Challenge class as well as a Lola B12/80 coupe in the Prototype 2 class from Laguna Seca onward. 

After debuting at the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans, Dempsey returned to France four years later and competed in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR at the 2013 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. Dempsey and his co-drivers finished 29th overall and fourth in-class. In 2015, Dempsey focused on participating in the FIA World Endurance Championship with his own Dempsey Racing-Proton team in the GTE-Am class in a Porsche 997 GT3 RSR, teamed with Patrick Long and Marco Seefried. He told Porsche Newsroom: &quot;Not much changes in my TV work, but everything changes constantly in motor racing – every lap, every bend and every moment.&quot;

===Promotional work===
He has been the face of L&#x27;Oreal and Versace and was featured in ads for Serengeti sunglasses. In November 2008, he launched an Avon fragrance named Unscripted. In June 2009, Women&#x27;s Wear Daily reported the launch of a second Avon fragrance named Patrick Dempsey 2. The fragrance was recognized as the &quot;Men&#x27;s Private Label/Direct Sell&quot; for the 2010 FiFi Awards. On September 29, 2012, Mexican cable company Cablemás, Megacable and Mexico city&#x27;s Cablevisión launched an advertising campaign featuring Dempsey as the love interest of a domestic worker who comes across his profile on an online dating site.

Starting in 2013, Patrick Dempsey became the face of Silhouette, promoting eyewear fashion from Austria. From January 2017 Dempsey appears for Vodafone Italy and he appears in some Italian spots about it. In 2018, Bleusalt, a Malibu-based fashion brand launched a clothing line designed by the actor.

===Business interests===

In January 2013, Dempsey announced that his company (Global Baristas) had secured the winning bid to purchase Seattle-based Tully&#x27;s Coffee, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. Dempsey&#x27;s bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully&#x27;s over the bids of six others, including Starbucks. Dempsey&#x27;s company will control 47 Tully&#x27;s locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business, which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.

Following a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully&#x27;s. Dempsey filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming Michael Avenatti borrowed $2 million against Tully&#x27;s assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan &quot;exorbitant&quot; and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully&#x27;s operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Dempsey&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s office issued a statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company &quot;all the best&quot;. Avenatti has stated the dispute was a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and will continue operating with other investors and new management.

===Philanthropy===
In 1997, Dempsey&#x27;s mother, Amanda, was diagnosed with cancer which subsequently relapsed five times. On March 24, 2014, she died in Lewiston, Maine, aged 79. In response to his mother&#x27;s bouts with cancer, Dempsey helped start the Patrick Dempsey Center at Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. In October 2009, when Dempsey introduced the first Dempsey Challenge, registration was closed after reaching the goal of 3,500 cyclists, runners and walkers. The event raised more than $1 million for the cancer center. His mother was in the crowd as Dempsey finished his ride. The Challenge has since become an annual October event presented by Amgen in the Lewiston–Auburn area. On May 28, 2017, Dempsey received an honorary doctorate from Bates College in his hometown, Lewiston, Maine, for his philanthropy in the town and funding of &quot;the Dempsey Center — just blocks from the Bates campus.&quot;

Dempsey was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bowdoin College in 2013 for his philanthropic work. His &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; character Derek Shepherd had been written as a Bowdoin graduate after an alumnus led a petition signed by over 450 students to &quot;adopt&quot; the character as an alumnus.

In 2023, Dempsey helped raise funds for families of the Lewiston shooting victims. He joined a charity softball tournament with former Boston Red Sox pitcher Bill &quot;Spaceman&quot; Lee.

==Personal life==
Dempsey was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 12. As a result, it is necessary for him to memorize all his lines to perform, even for auditions where he is unlikely to get the part.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put Dempsey&#x27;s hair on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;What made &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; a mega-medi-hit? It could have something to do with creator Shonda Rhimes&#x27;s scalpel-sharp writing… or McDreamy&#x27;s impossibly luxurious man hair. Just saying.&quot; In 2005, &quot;People&quot; magazine ranked him second in its annual list of &quot;Sexiest Men Alive&quot; and again in 2006. Patrick Dempsey was named People magazine&#x27;s 2023 &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; for its November 2023 issue.

Dempsey has been married twice. On August 24, 1987, he married his manager, actress and acting coach, Rochelle &quot;Rocky&quot; Parker, when he was 21 and she was 48. She appeared with Dempsey in the film &quot;In the Mood&quot;. While it has been reported that Dempsey married his best friend&#x27;s mother, he has said that he became best friends with Parker&#x27;s son only after he became romantically involved with Parker. The couple divorced on April 26, 1994. She died in 2014.

On July 31, 1999, Dempsey married makeup artist Jillian Fink. The couple have three children. In January 2015, Fink filed for divorce, but the couple reconciled later in the year. They called off their divorce on November 12, 2016.
Dempsey formerly owned a home in Harpswell, Maine near his hometown. His mother moved into a farm next to his home. Dempsey is a supporter of Scottish football club Rangers F.C. because of his Scottish connection through his step-grandfather.

<text>Robin Wilson (born July 12, 1965) is an American musician most notable for his work as the lead vocalist of the alternative rock band Gin Blossoms.

==Career==
Wilson replaced Richard Taylor as guitarist of Gin Blossoms in 1988, but switched places early on with vocalist Jesse Valenzuela. He remained a member of the band until its disbandment in 1997; prior to its split, the band released two albums. Its hit second album, &quot;New Miserable Experience,&quot; was certified quadruple platinum and featured singles &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot;, &quot;Found Out About You&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Rita&quot;, &quot;Until I Fall Away&quot;, and Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Allison Road&quot;. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Congratulations I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, which sold platinum, featured singles such as &quot;Follow You Down&quot;, &quot;As Long as It Matters&quot;, &quot;Not Only Numb&quot;, and &quot;Day Job&quot;, as well as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Highwire&quot;.

After the breakup of Gin Blossoms, Wilson was the lead vocalist and songwriter for the band Gas Giants, which also included guitarist Dan Henzerling and former Gin Blossoms drummer Phil Rhodes. He also contributed vocals for The Longshadows album &quot;Simple Minded Way&quot;.

In 1995, Robin Wilson had an idea for an animated TV series called The Poppin&#x27; Wheelies: a teenage rock &amp; roll band with a magical guitar travels through outer space while being chased by an evil witch&#x27;s minion new wave band, the Techno-pops, who try to retrieve the enchanted instrument. While the animated series was worked on, it was never released. The supporting music for the series was released in November 2000 in an album of the same name, &quot;The Poppin&#x27; Wheelies&quot;.

When the Gin Blossoms reunited in 2002, Wilson began touring with the band as well as recording the album &quot;Major Lodge Victory&quot;. Released on August 8, 2006, the album featured the singles &quot;Learning the Hard Way&quot; and &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;.

Wilson ran his own studio, Uranus Recording in Tempe, Arizona, which he opened in 1994 until its closing in 2015.

Wilson has served as an occasional lead singer for The Smithereens since the 2017 death of lead singer Pat DiNizio.

==Personal life==
Wilson grew up in Tempe, Arizona. Wilson graduated from McClintock High School in Tempe, Arizona. He attended Mesa Community College, where his father was a professor, from 1983 to 1988, majoring in planetary science, although he did not graduate. He is married to Gena Rositano who is the stage manager for SNL and they have 2 children. They currently live on Long Island, New York.

<doc id="711755" wikidata="Q917228" url="?curid=711755" title="RCA 1802">
<text>The COSMAC (Complementary Symmetry Monolithic Array Computer) is an 8-bit microprocessor family introduced by RCA. It is historically notable as the first CMOS microprocessor. The first production model was the two-chip CDP1801R and CDP1801U, which were later combined into the single-chip CDP1802. The 1802 represented the majority of COSMAC production, and today the entire line is known simply as the RCA 1802.

The processor design traces its history to an experimental home computer designed by Joseph Weisbecker in the early 1970s, built at his home using TTL components. RCA began development of the CMOS version of the processor design in 1973, sampling it in 1974 with plans to move to a single-chip implementation immediately. Jerry Herzog led the design of the single-chip version, which sampled in 1975 and entered production in 1976.

In contrast to most designs of the era, which were fabricated using the NMOS process, the COSMAC was implemented in CMOS form and used static logic. This allowed it to run at lower power settings and even be stopped completely; in addition it would run cooler and not generate as much heat as NMOS chips. RCA also produced radiation hardened versions, which found use in the aerospace field. These remain in production as of 2022, and as of 2008 continued to be produced by Renesas (formerly Intersil).

Successors to the 1802 are the CDP1804, CDP1805, and CDP1806, which have an extended instruction set, other enhanced features (like on-chip RAM and ROM, and built-in timer), with some versions running at faster clock speeds, though not a significant speed difference. Some features are also lost, like the DMA auto-boot loader functionality. There are also some minor pin function changes, but the line continues to be produced in its original 40-pin dual in-line package (DIP) format.

==History==
===FRED===
Joseph Weisbecker had long been fascinated with the potential for computers in the home, having stated as early as 1955 that he expected they would one day be built into practically every device. The technology of the era made small embedded computers impossible, but the introduction of the integrated circuit (IC) in the 1960s changed things dramatically. In 1974 he described the possibilities in an IEEE Computer article:

Beginning in 1970, Weisbecker began the design of a small machine using RCA transistor-transistor logic (TTL) ICs to construct the processor. Other parts, switches and lamps and such, he had to buy from Radio Shack, deliberately spreading his purchases around four stores so no one would ask him why he was buying so many parts. The design was running in October 1971, containing 100 chips spread over multiple circuit boards.

The result, which he called FRED, ostensibly for Flexible Recreational Educational Device, was packaged into a box that was not unlike the Altair 8800 of a few years later, with toggle switches on the front panel for input, lamps for output, and later adding a hex pad keyboard. Weisbecker added new features continually and by 1972 it had gained a character generator and the ability to load and save programs on cassette tapes.

Weisbecker&#x27;s daughter, Joyce Weisbecker, was immediately drawn to the system and began writing programs for it. This included several games, which were ported to later machines based on the COSMAC. When RCA entered the game console business in the later 1970s, these games were burned to ROM cartridge form, and Joyce became the first known female commercial videogame developer.

===Release===
Weisbecker demonstrated the machine to RCA management throughout this period, but there was little interest at first. This was shortly after David Sarnoff had retired and handed the CEO role to his son, Robert Sarnoff. Robert was more interested in building the media side of the company while dating recording stars, ignoring RCA Laboratories in spite of a number of industry-leading developments taking place there. Some of the skepticism displayed by management may have had to do with the company&#x27;s recent sale of their mainframe computer business to Sperry Rand with a huge writedown.

Eventually, the company became interested in the system and began adapting it to their newly introduced COS/MOS fabrication system. A 1973 lab report refers to a &quot;prototype&quot; being delivered in 1972, but this is likely referring to the original TTL implementation. It goes on to note that an effort to reduce the processor to a two-chip implementation with deliveries in COS/MOS in 1974. It is here that the processor is first referred to as COSMAC, for COmplementary-Symmetry-Monolithic-Array Computer. It goes on to state that another lab will be producing the system in an 8-chip silicon-on-sapphire format, although the date is simply &quot;soon after&quot; the CMOS versions, and that plans for a single-chip version were already being planned.

===COSMAC devices===
Although RCA began the development of the COSMAC in the early 1970s, it was some time before they introduced their own products based on it. In 1975, a prototype of an arcade game machine with swappable ROMs was experimented with for the coin-op business, but was ultimately abandoned.

Meanwhile, Weisbecker had adapted the original FRED, known within RCA as System 00 by this time, using the new chipset to produce a greatly simplified single-board system known as then COSMAC ELF. Building instructions were described in an article in Popular Electronics magazine in 1976, and an expanded version with various upgrades in a second article in 1977. A unique feature of the ELF is that it did not require any read only memory (ROM) for startup, instead, the processor&#x27;s direct memory access (DMA) system was used to read front-panel switches directly into memory.

RCA debated whether to introduce pre-packaged versions of the ELF to the market. While they debated, further development led to a simplified machine combining the ELF with a new display driver chip, the CDP1861, to produce a game console. During this time, Joyce Weisbecker (Joseph&#x27;s daughter) was hired by RCA to write several videogames for the platform, including a quiz-style educational product in partnership with Random House, one of the many companies that had been picked up by RCA&#x27;s buying sprees.

After a year of discussion, the company eventually decided to release two mass-market products based on the platform, a kit computer known as the COSMAC VIP, and a game console known as the RCA Studio II. The machines had been available since 1975, but the Studio II was announced only in January 1977, a couple of months after the Fairchild Channel F became the first cartridge-based machine on the market. Both would soon be eclipsed and largely forgotten due to the release of the Atari 2600 later that year. RCA canceled the Studio II in February 1978.

RCA also released a series of modular computer systems, based on the RCA Microboard form factor from the 1802&#x27;s initial release, up until the collapse of RCA itself. These were mainly aimed at industrial applications and systems development, and were highly configurable.

===Embedded use===
The COSMAC was unique among early 8-bit processors in that it had been explicitly designed for microcomputer use; other designs of the era were invariably aimed at the embedded processor space, and those that had been designed for computer use were generally more complex systems, and often 16-bit. Although the COSMAC had been designed for computer use, RCA&#x27;s slow market entry and undersupported attempts in this market ultimately failed and other processors like the MOS 6502, Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80 would come to dominate this market. Ironically, COSMAC would ultimately find great success in the embedded market, because its CMOS design allowed it to work at lower power. By the late 1970s it was widely used in many industrial settings, and especially aerospace. Multiple 1802s were used as auxiliary IO processors in the Galileo probe to Jupiter in 1989, and it remains in use in similar roles to this day.

== Applications ==

=== Microcomputer systems ===
A number of early microcomputers were based on the 1802, including the COSMAC ELF (1976), Netronics ELF II, Quest SuperELF, COSMAC VIP, Comx-35, Finnish Telmac 1800, Telmac TMC-600 and Oscom Nano, Yugoslav Pecom 32 and 64, and the CyberVision 2001 systems sold through Montgomery Ward in the late 1970s, as well as the RCA Studio II video game console (one of the first consoles to use bitmapped graphics). The Edukit single-board computer trainer system, similar to an expanded COSMAC Elf, was offered by Modus Systems Ltd. in Britain in the early 1980s. Infinite Incorporated produced an 1802-based, S-100 bus expandable console computer trainer in the late 1970s called the UC1800, available assembled or in kit form.

As part of 1802 retrocomputing hobbyist work, other computers have been built more recently (post-2000), including the Membership Card microcomputer kit that fits in an Altoids tin and the Spare Time Gizmos Elf 2000 (Elf 2K), among others. See for other systems.

=== Product integration ===
 The 1802 was used in scientific instruments and commercial products.

The 1802 was used in Plessey Payphones.

Post-1980 Chrysler and associated model vehicles use the 1802 in their second-generation Electronic Lean-Burn System, with electronic spark control, one of the first on-board auto computer-based control systems.

The 1802 was used in the manufacture of pinball machines and video arcade games in Spain.

=== Radiation hardening ===
A high-speed version of the 1802 was fabricated in Silicon on Sapphire (SOS) semiconductor process technology, which gives it a degree of resistance to radiation and electrostatic discharge (ESD). A different radiation-hardened version of the 1802, developed jointly by RCA and Sandia National Laboratories, was built on bulk silicon using C2L (Closed COS/MOS Logic) technology. Along with its extreme low-power abilities, this makes the chip well-suited in space and military applications. (Also, at the time the 1802 was introduced, very few, if any, other radiation-hardened microprocessors were available in the market).

=== Space technology and science ===
The 1802 was used in many spacecraft and space science programs, experiments, projects and modules such as the Galileo spacecraft, Magellan, the Plasma Wave Analyzer instrument on ESA&#x27;s Ulysses spacecraft, various Earth-orbiting satellites and satellites carrying amateur radio.

The 1802 was used in NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope.

=== Military uses ===
A number of British military items from the 1980s and 1990s used the 1802, amongst them:

* L1A1 Fuze Setter
* SAWES training system (Small Arms Weapons Effects Simulator) fitted to SLR / SA80 rifles
* Ptarmigan battlefield communications system

== Programming languages ==
The first high-level language available for the 1802 was Forth, provided by Forth, Inc. and it was known as MicroFORTH, in 1976 (see Forth Inc&#x27;s archive). Other available programming languages, both interpreters and compilers, are CHIP-8 (also invented by Joseph Weisbecker) (and variants), 8th (a version of Forth created by Lee Hart), Tom Pittman&#x27;s Tiny BASIC, C, various Assemblers and cross-assemblers, and others. Other specialty languages were used by federal agencies such as NASA and its installations, including Johnson Space Center, AMES, Goddard, Langley, Marshall, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which included the HAL/S cross-compiler, STOIC, a Forth-like language, and others.

Interpreter for Process Structures (IPS), a programming language and development environment, was specifically written and used for real-time control of AMSAT satellites.

=== Emulators and simulators ===
The 1802 chip and computers using the microprocessor have been emulated and simulated in hardware and/or software by hobbyists. There are three designs in VHDL for an FPGA. A bus-accurate, full speed COSMAC Elf clone was created without a CDP1802 microprocessor chip or CDP1861 video chip using PIC microcontrollers. An online simulator of the COSMAC Elf (enhanced) written in JavaScript runs in the user&#x27;s browser with no need to download.

== Description ==
=== Introduction ===
The RCA 1802 has a static core CMOS design with no minimum clock frequency, so that it can be run at very low speeds and low power, including a clock frequency of zero to suspend the microprocessor without affecting its operation.

It has two separate 8-pin buses: an 8-bit bidirectional data bus and a time-multiplexed address bus, with the high-order and low-order 8-bits of the 16-bit address being accessed on alternate clock cycles. This contrasts with most designs of the era, like the MOS 6502 and Intel 8080, which used a 16-bit address bus.

The 1802 has a single bit, programmable and testable output port (Q), and four input pins that are directly tested by branch instructions (EF1-EF4). These pins allow simple input/output (I/O) tasks to be handled directly and easily programmed.

Because the instructions took 16 or 24 clock cycles to complete, the 1802 was not particularly fast. For comparison, the 6502 completes most instruction in 2 to 4 clock cycles, with the longest (official instruction) taking 7 cycles.

=== Part number suffix designations ===
Various suffixes to the CDP1802 part number denote technical specifications, including (A, B, &amp; C) &quot;operating speed&quot; (3.2 MHz to 6.4 MHz), &quot;temperature&quot; (-40 °C to +85 °C, -55 °C to +125 °C), and &quot;voltage ranges&quot; (4V to 10.5V), &quot;package type&quot; (D, E, Q), and &quot;burn-in&quot; (X). These were somewhat standardized between the various source suppliers, including RCA, Intersil, Harris, Hughes Aircraft, and Solid State Scientific (SSS). Hughes used the HCMP prefix, and SSS used the SCP (and possibly BCP) prefix, instead of CDP, and had additional suffixes that have not been documented as of yet. (examples: CDP1802A, CDP1802ACE, CDP1802BCD, HCMP1802AP, SCP1802D)
=== Registers and I/O ===

The 1802 is an 8-bit byte machine, with minimal support for 16-bit operations, except via 2-byte manipulation. The primary accumulator is the 8-bit &#x27;D&#x27; register (Data register). The single bit carry flag is DF (Data Flag). Most operations use the D register, including arithmetic and logic functions, and memory referencing load and store instructions. Most 16-bit operations have to work on the lower byte and then the upper byte, via D, using the DF as carry and borrow as needed.

An important feature of the 1802 is a set of sixteen registers of 16 bits each, used primarily for addressing. Using the SEP instruction, you can select any of the 16 registers to be the program counter; using the SEX instruction, you can select any of the 16-bit registers to be the index register. Register R0 has the special use of holding the memory address for the built-in DMA controller. Register R1 has the special use of being the program counter for the interrupt handler.

There are instructions that allow the values in these registers to be set and read via D, separately working the upper and lower 8-bits at a time. There are also instructions to perform increment and decrement of the entire 16-bit value, and a few instructions perform automatic increment and decrement, like LDA (load advance) and STXD (store via X and decrement). 16-bit register and value comparisons would also need to use the D register as a go-between, using multiple instructions to perform the operations.

The processor has five special I/O lines. There is a single Q output that can be set with the SEQ instruction and reset with the REQ instruction. There are four external, single-bit flag inputs, EF1, EF2, EF3, and EF4, and there are eight dedicated branch instructions to conditionally branch based on the state of those input lines. There are seven Input and seven Output port instructions that utilize the RX register and D accumulator.

The EF and Q lines were typically used for multiple interfaces on 1802-based hobbyist computers because of the lines&#x27; favorable and easy handling. It was typical for the Q line to drive a status LED, a cassette interface, an RS-232 interface, and the speaker. This meant that the user could actually hear RS-232 and cassette data being transmitted (unless a volume control was implemented). Traditionally, the EF4 line is attached to the INPUT momentary pushbutton on the COSMAC Elf. Other systems might use one of the other lines.

There are some other special use registers and flags, some internal, and some usable programmatically: 4-bit N, P, X, and I; 8-bit T; and 1-bit IE.
On the Internet, there is many versions of a Table of the 1802 Instructions, here is one link :
https://www.atarimagazines.com/computeii/issue3/page52.php
There is a number of Tables in the File area for logged in members of the 1802 online club for forum at https://groups.io/g/cosmacelf/files.
Each Instruction is a single Byte, of 8 Bits. The 4 Bits to the Left, sometimes called High Order Hex Digit, are to do with the actual nature of the Instruction, and those 4 Bits are involved with the I Register. The 4 Bits to the Right, sometimes called Low Order Hex Digit, are to do with the working Register, where Data is taken from, or put into it, and those 4 Bits are involved with the N Register.
When a Program is being done, the various stages of the work and the Processes, are stored temporarily in the Register pointed to by the N Register, like what happens, when long Multiplication, or long Division, is done on a piece of paper.
Of course sometimes the Data is moved to and from the Ram Memory section, and different Branches of the Program are done,
as needed, in the flow of time.

=== Branching ===
There are three types of unconditional and conditional branching in the 1802, Short and Long, and Skips.

Short branches are 2-byte instructions, and use 256-byte range, single byte address, page absolute addressing in the range 0 to 255 (hex FF). There is no relative branching. The short branch always jumps within the page that contains the address byte.

Long branches use full 16-bit addressing to support the 64K memory address space, and are the only 3-byte instructions.

Skip instructions increment the PC by one for the unconditional Short Skip, or two for the Long Skips. Only the Long Skip has conditional branching.

=== Subroutine calls ===
The processor does not have standard subroutine CALL address and RET instructions, though they can be simulated. The 16-register design makes possible some interesting subroutine call and return mechanisms, though they are better suited to small programs than general purpose coding.

A few commonly used subroutines can be called quickly by keeping their address in one of the 16 registers; however, the called subroutine must know (hard coded) what the calling PC register is to perform the &quot;return&quot; instruction. The SEP instruction is used to call a subroutine pointed to by one of the 16-bit registers and another SEP to return to the caller (SEP stands for &quot;Set Program Counter&quot;, and selects which one of the 16 registers is to be used as the program counter from that point onward). Before a subroutine returns, it jumps to the location immediately preceding its entry point so that after the SEP &quot;return&quot; instruction returns control to the caller, the register will be pointing to the right value for next usage. (the processor always increments the PC after reference and usage (retrieving the next instruction to execute), so this technique works as noted)

An interesting variation of this scheme is to have two or more subroutines in a ring so that they are called in round robin order. On early hobbyist computers, tricks and techniques like this were commonly used in the horizontal refresh interrupt to reprogram the scan line address to repeat each scan line four times for the video controller.

One well-known and often-used routine is known as SCRT (Standard CALL and RETURN Technique), which allows general purpose subroutine Call and Return, including passing of parameters &quot;in line&quot;, and nested subroutines using a stack. Although any of the available registers can be used for this technique, per programmer&#x27;s preference, many use the routine supplied by RCA in the CDP1802 User Manual, where the suggested register usage is R2 = Stack Pointer, R3 = General Program Counter (PC), R4 = Call, R5 = Return, R6 = Passed Arguments Pointer (non-destructive). Even though these supportive routines are small, there is an execution speed overhead using them. (as opposed to what would be incurred if actual CALL and RET instructions were part of the microprocessor&#x27;s design) This setup allows R0 to be used for DMA and R1 to be used for Interrupts, if desired, allowing R7 through RF (hex) for general program usage.

=== Addressing modes ===
Because of the 16-bit address bus, and the 8-bit data bus, the sixteen general purpose registers are 16 bits wide, but the accumulator D-register is only 8 bits wide. The accumulator, therefore, tends to be a bottleneck. Transferring the contents of one register to another involves four instructions (one Get and one Put on the HI byte of the register, and a similar pair for the LO byte: GHI R1; PHI R2; GLO R1; PLO R2). Similarly, loading a new constant into a register (such as a new address for a subroutine jump, or the address of a data variable) also involves four instructions (two load immediate, LDI, instructions, one for each half of the constant, each one followed by a Put instruction to the register, PHI and PLO).

The two addressing modes &quot;Indirect register&quot;, and &quot;Indirect register with auto-increment&quot; are then fairly efficient, to perform 8-bit operations on the data in the accumulator. There are no other addressing modes, though. Thus, the &quot;direct addressing&quot; mode needs to be emulated using the four instructions mentioned earlier to load the address into a spare register; followed by an instruction to select that register as the index register; followed, finally, by the intended operation on the data variable that is pointed to by that address.

=== DMA and load mode ===
The CDP1802 has a simple built-in DMA controller, having two DMA request lines for DMA input and output. The CPU only accesses memory during certain cycles of the multi-step machine cycle, which required between 8 and 16 clock cycles. External hardware could read or write data during these periods without interrupting the processor, a general concept known as cycle stealing.

R0 is used as the DMA address pointer. The starting address of the DMA data would be put in R0 and then pulling the appropriate read or write pin on the CPU low. The CPU responded to the DMA request by incrementing the value in R0, so that the next request automatically stored in the next location in memory. Thus by simply repeatedly triggering the DMA pins, the system would walk through the entire memory.

The DMA controller also provides a special &quot;load mode&quot;, which allows loading of memory while the CLEAR and WAIT inputs of the processor are active. This allows a program to be loaded without the need for a ROM-based bootstrap loader. This was used by the COSMAC Elf microcomputer and its successors to load a program from toggle switches or a hexadecimal keypad with no required software and minimal hardware. The user could simply set the switches to the next value, toggle the read, and then move on. There was no need to change the addresses, that was done automatically by the DMA stepping.

=== Instruction timing ===
Clock cycle efficiency is poor in comparison to most 8-bit microprocessors. Eight clock cycles makes up one machine cycle. Most instructions take two machine cycles (16 clock cycles) to execute; the remaining instructions take three machine cycles (24 clock cycles). By comparison, the MOS Technology 6502 takes two to seven clock cycles to execute an instruction, and the Intel 8080 takes four to 18 clock cycles.

=== Graphics ===
In early 1802-based microcomputers, the companion graphics Video Display Controller chip, RCA CDP1861 (for the NTSC video format, CDP1864 variant for PAL), used the built-in DMA controller to display black and white bitmapped graphics on standard TV screens at up to 64 pixels horizontally by 128 pixels vertically. The 1861 was also known as the Pixie graphics system.

Although the faster versions of 1802 could operate at 4–5 MHz (at 5 V; it was faster (6.4 MHz) at 10 V), it was usually operated at 3.58 MHz, divided by 2 (1.79 MHz) to suit the requirements of the 1861 chip, which gave a speed of a little over 100,000 instructions per second, though some ran at other speeds such as the ~2.8 MHz of the Comx or 5 MHz of the Pecom. The COSMAC VIP, which integrated the video chip with the processor as a single purpose-built computer (rather than as an add-on to a hobbyist kit), notably ran the 1802 much slower, synchronising it exactly with the 1861 - at a non-standard 1.76064 MHz, as recommended in the Pixie&#x27;s spec sheet reference design.

The CDP1862 Color Generator Circuit IC, an 1861 companion chip, could be used to generate color graphics. Some computer systems, like the Pecom 64 or the Telmac TMC-600, used the VIS (Video Interface System), consisting of the CDP1869 and CDP1870 companion ICs, for distinctly higher resolution color graphics, comparable to other 8-bit systems of the 1980s.

== Code samples ==

This small code example tests the Event Flag (EF) pins. To test pins one through four, change B4 to B2, which tests EF2 pin.

LOOP

B4 EFbranch; because EF pins pins are active low this makes it behave as a not gate

REQ

BR LOOP

Note: The above routine presumes that the CDP1802 microprocessor is in an initial reset state (or that it has been set as such prior to executing this code). Therefore, the program counter (PC) and the X indirect register &#x27;pointer&#x27; are both set to 16-bit register R0. That is why you can output an immediate value, as in the example &#x27;OUT 4,00&#x27;, because PC and X are both pointing to R0. The PC is incremented after the opcode instruction byte is retrieved from memory, so it points to the next address when the OUT 4 is executed. Therefore, it outputs the value in memory pointed to by RX = R0, which is the next immediate byte. The OUT instruction also increments the X register, which is R0, which is also the PC, so it outputs the immediate value after the OUT and continues program execution at the next instruction address after the immediate value. This is why you see the routine set X (SEX) to register R6 and R0 as needed. Also note that, although the OUT opcode increments the RX register, to easily output a section of memory (&#x27;buffer&#x27;), INP does not. It stores the value at the address pointed to by RX and into the D 8-bit data byte accumulator, but RX is not modified.

The routine also presumes that OUT 4 will display the value in the CPU system&#x27;s 8-bit LED or 2-digit hex display, and IN 4 gets the value from the eight toggle switches (or possibly the hex keypad). The BN4 opcode (loop; * = &#x27;this address&#x27;), &quot;branch if the single-bit input EF4 line is lo&quot;, is used to test if the momentary &#x27;Input&#x27; pushbutton is pressed. The B4 opcode (&#x27;if hi&#x27;) loop waits for the button to be released. SEQ and REQ turn the single Q line, which is usually attached to an LED, on and off.

The 1802 is a &quot;byte machine&quot;, but has 16 16-bit registers, R0-RF (sometimes referred to as 0-F without the &#x27;R&#x27; prefix). To deal with 16-bit register data, the programmer must Get and Put the Hi or Lo values of the registers using the D accumulator as the go-between. These high and low bytes of the registers are sometimes referred to as Rn.0 (lo) and Rn.1 (hi). Short Branches are 2-byte opcodes with page-absolute addressing, and a 256-byte address boundary. Long Branches are 3-byte opcodes with full 16-bit address branching.

This information should make the routine more understandable to any computer programmer who is knowledgeable enough to read &quot;pseudo-code&quot; and is minimally familiar with assembly and machine language programming.

<text>Jesse Valenzuela (born May 22, 1962) is an American rock musician and singer who is perhaps best known as a member of the alternative rock band Gin Blossoms. He was originally the vocalist in Gin Blossoms when the band first formed in 1987.

In 1988, he switched roles with the band&#x27;s new guitarist, Robin Wilson. He continued to be a member until the band&#x27;s breakup in 1997, and reunited with the rest of the group in 2002.

As a songwriter, Valenzuela has written or co-written Gin Blossoms songs including &quot;Til I Hear It From You,&quot; &quot;Follow You Down,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Rita,&quot; &quot;Until I Fall Away&quot; and &quot;As Long As It Matters.&quot;

Valenzuela has talked about a lifelong fascination with music and the guitar. He began to play in public when he was 15.

&quot;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of music,&quot; Valenzuela noted in a 2018 interview with &quot;Icon Vs. Icon&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve gotten older now, and my mother&#x27;s started handing over lots of photographs from my childhood. It seems that I always had a guitar in my hand as a kid. I do remember just wanting a guitar really badly and it was all I thought about at that age. I was playing in bars by the time I was 15.&quot;

Several years of honing his craft in the Arizona music world brought Valenzuela into contact with Gin Blossoms founder and Tempe neighbor Doug Hopkins – and in 1987, Valenzuela joined the band.

By 1989, the Gin Blossoms were fully up and running and released their first album, &quot;Dusted&quot;, with Hopkins serving as the principal songwriter but with Valenzuela contributing four tracks.

Although an independent, low-budget effort, &quot;Dusted&quot; planted a flag in the ground for the Arizona rockers. Some of its songs – &quot;Lost Horizons,&quot; &quot;Hey Jealousy&quot; and &quot;Found Out About You&quot; – reached a wider audience when included on the band&#x27;s major-label debut, 1992&#x27;s &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;. That album spawned six singles and achieved multi-platinum status.

&quot;All Music&quot; described &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; as &quot;a tight and lean collection of brilliant, edgy pop music.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;fresh and highly personal,&quot; and said: &quot;the ease with which this quintet casts hooks suggests that there&#x27;s plenty more in store.&quot;

The band&#x27;s follow-up album, released several years after Hopkins&#x27;s 1993 suicide, bore the evocative title &quot;Congratulations I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;. The title was intended to summarize the sentiments expressed to band members arising from &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot;&#x27;s success and Hopkins&#x27; tragic death. Though it was recorded in harrowing circumstances and required other band members to take over songwriting duties, &quot;Congratulations ... I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; was a commercial success, reaching #10 on the Billboard charts.

&quot;All Music&quot; said the album was &quot;filled with chiming guitars, sweet melodies, and simple, catchy hooks, as well as a sturdy grasp of traditional pop/rock songwriting that results in a number of gems.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised album&#x27;s &quot;jangling, radio-friendly tunes.&quot;

Sandwiched between the two albums and appearing on the Empire Records movie soundtrack was the song that Billboard magazine called &quot;The closest thing to a perfect pop song to hit radio in recent memory,&quot; Valenzuela&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Til I Hear It From You.&quot; The double-A side single of &quot;Til I Hear It From You&quot;/&quot;Follow You Down&quot; is the Gin Blossom&#x27;s top single, reaching #9 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and rising to #1 in Canada.

Subsequent Gin Blossoms albums &quot;Major Lodge Victory&quot; (2006), &quot;No Chocolate Cake&quot; (2010) and &quot;Mixed Reality&quot; (2018) produced songs such as &quot;Miss Disarray,&quot; &quot;Learning the Hard Way&quot; and &quot;Heart Shaped Locket.&quot;

In addition to his work with the Gin Blossoms, Valenzuela has been active as a solo artist, session player, producer and composer for movies and television.

Valenzuela&#x27;s work for film includes the song &quot;Screwed Up,&quot; written with Susan Sandberg for the Farrelly Brothers&#x27; 2007 remake of &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;. NBC featured his song &quot;Change 4 Me,&quot; cowritten with Moon and Danny Wilde, in promotions for the 2008 Olympics. And &quot;Follow You Down&quot; was featured in the 2003 film &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot;.&quot;

In 2004, he collaborated with Canadian singer-songwriter Craig Northey on the album &quot;Northey Valenzuela&quot;. They co-wrote and performed &quot;Not A Lot Goin&#x27; On,&quot; the theme song to the Canadian sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot;.

In 2002, he released a solo album, &quot;Tunes Young People Will Enjoy.&quot;, followed by &quot;Hotel Defeated&quot; in 2015. A third solo effort, &quot;Pete&quot;, was released in 2020.

In 2016, he released &quot;Prairie Wind&quot;, a collaboration with Danny Wilde, a founding member of The Rembrandts.

In 2022, Valenzuela was touring with the Gin Blossoms as the band was marking the 30th anniversary of the release of &quot;New Miserable Experience&quot; and was performing solo shows in the Phoenix area.

He is of Mexican American descent.

<doc id="711760" wikidata="Q2355080" url="?curid=711760" title="Second Sophistic">
<text>The Second Sophistic is a literary-historical term referring to the Greek writers who flourished from the reign of Nero until c. A.D. 230 and who were catalogued and celebrated by Philostratus in his &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot;. However, some recent research has indicated that this Second Sophistic, which was previously thought to have very suddenly and abruptly appeared in the late 1st century, actually had its roots in the early 1st century. It was followed in the 5th century by the philosophy of Byzantine rhetoric, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Third Sophistic&quot;.

Writers known as members of the Second Sophistic include Nicetes of Smyrna, Aelius Aristides, Dio Chrysostom, Herodes Atticus, Favorinus, Philostratus, Lucian, and Polemon of Laodicea. Plutarch is also often associated with the Second Sophistic movement as well, although many historians consider him to have been somewhat aloof from its emphasis on rhetoric, especially in his later work.

The term &quot;Second Sophistic&quot; comes from Philostratus. In his &quot;Lives of the Sophists&quot;, Philostratus traces the beginnings of the movement to the orator Aeschines in the 4th century BC. But its earliest representative was really Nicetes of Smyrna, in the late 1st century AD. Unlike the original Sophistic movement of the 5th century BC, the Second Sophistic was little concerned with politics. But it was, to a large degree, to meet the everyday needs and respond to the practical problems of Greco-Roman society. It came to dominate higher education and left its mark on many forms of literature. The period from around AD 50 to 100 was a period when oratorical elements dealing with the first sophists of Greece were reintroduced to the Roman Empire. The province of Asia embraced the Second Sophistic the most. Diococceianus (or Chrysostomos) and Aelius Aristides were popular sophists of the period. They gave orations upon topics like poetry and public speaking. They did not teach debate or anything that had to do with politics because rhetoric was restrained due to the imperial government&#x27;s rules.

Owing largely to the influence of Plato and Aristotle, philosophy came to be regarded as distinct from sophistry, the latter being regarded as specious and rhetorical, a practical discipline. Thus, by the time of the Roman Empire, a sophist was simply a teacher of rhetoric and a popular public speaker. For instance, Libanius, Himerius, Aelius Aristides, and Fronto were sophists in this sense.

==Introduction==
The year 146 BC marks the moment in history in which the Romans conquered one of the first civilized empires in the West. Ancient Greece is known for its rich culture, mythology, technology and intellect. In its classical period it was one of the greatest early empires. After the civilization fell to the Roman conquest, the emerging empire would begin to grow following many of the traditions of the Greeks. Mirroring some of their architectural styles and adapting a similar religious cult, the Empire held the Greek culture with reverence to its customs. Throughout its growth, the Romans incorporated the Greeks into their society and imperial life. In the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, a renaissance of Hellenic oratory and education captivated the Roman elites. The resurgence was called the Second Sophistic and it recalled the grand orators and teachings of the 5th century BC. “The sophist was to revive the antique purer form of religion and to encourage the cults of the heroes and Homeric gods.”

In this century, the Roman Emperors such as Trajan, Hadrian and numerous others, held these intellectuals in their high esteem. Many of them paid patronage to Athens and other Greek cities in the Empire. Elites sent their sons to be educated in schools developed by these sophists. The Emperor Hadrian sent his adoptive son Antoninus to study under the acclaimed Polemo in Smyrna. The Second Sophistic opened doors for the Greeks to prosper surprisingly, in many ways on their own terms. This renaissance enabled them to become a prominent society that the Romans could respect and revere. The sophists and their movement provided a way for the Romans to legitimate themselves as civilized intellectuals and associate themselves with an old imperial pre-eminence. This movement allowed the Greeks to become a part of the Roman Empire but still retain their cultural identity.

==Definition of sophist==

Sophism was the revival of the use and value of higher education in the Roman Empire during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. This also included a renewed emphasis and importance of rhetoric and oratory. The practice and teachings were modeled after the Athenian vocabulary of 400 BC, as well as the Hellenic traditions of that time. The sophists were great lecturers and declaimers who esteemed to address various issues of political, economic and social importance. Thus, they served a vast array of positions from educational and social leaders, to ambassadors, Imperial Secretaries and high priests. In these orders, they won the favor of Emperors who would restore their eastern centers of intellect. Some, such as Lucian, heavily favored Atticism (an artificial purist movement favoring archaic expressions), while others, such as Plutarch, favored the Greek of their day (Koine Greek).

==Oratorical styles==
A resurgence of educational value occurred during this time and these sophists were at the heart of it. They emphasized the importance of the practice of oratory. Sophists would begin their careers lecturing to groups of students. As they gained recognition and further competence they would begin speaking out to the public. There were two different oratory styles of sophism that developed out of the period of enlightenment: Asianism and Atticism.

===Asianism===
Philostratus describes Asianism as a form that &quot;[...] aims at but never achieves the grand style&quot;. He adds that its style is more &quot;flowery, bombastic, full of startling metaphors, too metrical, too dependent on the tricks of rhetoric, too emotional&quot;. This type of rhetoric is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Ionian&quot; and &quot;Ephesian&quot;, because it came from outside of Athens. 

===Atticism===
The other mode of rhetoric, Atticism, is explained by Philostratus as technique that is exemplified by the sophist Aelius Aristides. He describes Aristides as one who &quot;usually imitates some classical author, aims at simplicity of style, and is a purist, carefully avoiding any allusion or word that does not occur in a writer of the classical period&quot;. Atticism drew from Greece’s rich past and originated in its illustrious city of Athens. The lectures and declamations of these sophists were based more upon preparation and the studying of information. Having this basis, they were then able to speak adeptly to their audiences. The sophists generally gave their discourses in Rome or one of three major sophist centres.

==Centres and key figures==
The three main centers of sophism were: Ephesus, Smyrna and Athens. The sophists revitalized these cities bringing in wealth, acclaim and foreign interest from around the Empire. 

Smyrna was an important Greek city in the Empire at this age. Two noteworthy sophists, Polemon of Laodicea and Aelius Aristides, were educated and taught in this center, attracting the respect of its citizens. They also invited the attention or patronage of Roman Emperors such as Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. Although neither of these men called the city their birthplace, both Polemo and Aristides spent much of their time here studying the rhetoric or advocating for its people. Another esteemed sophist in the 2nd century, Herodes Atticus, paved the way for succeeding sophists of Atticism in the great center of Athens. These three eminent connoisseurs of rhetoric were significant sophists of the 2nd century AD. Many succeeding them would strive to replicate and illustrate their immense knowledge of the Hellenic classics and eloquent skills in oratory.

Polemo of Laodicea was the earliest of the trio. He was born in approximately 85 AD and is the only Asianic orator of Smyrna. Like so many of the other sophists, Polemo came from a ranked family. He, therefore, had connections and status with the local administration and it was easy for him to thrive in political and social aspects. Being from an elite family provided him the means and footing to be able study the sophistic discipline. His wealth and political connections allowed him to travel and prosper in his role as an expert of robust rhetoric. Not only was Polemo admired in Smyrna and other surrounding Greek centers of intellect, he was quite popular and venerated in Rome as well. He acted as a sort of advocate for his area. Polemo found a great deal of favor in the eyes of the Emperors Trajan, Hadrian and Antoninus. 

The Roman elites and Emperors valued the approval and sponsorship of acclaimed sophists. Herodes Atticus, at one point in time, received up to three letters a day from Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The Emperor also waited three days in Smyrna for the honor of meeting the student of Herodes and Polemo, Aelius Aristides. He then was required to wait one more day, before he was allowed to hear him speak. 

It seems that the association and a positive close relationship with these experts of rhetoric were coveted by these imperial officials. The sophists were held with high regard by those in surrounding regions and even by Roman elites and bureaucrats. “No other type of intellectual could compete with them in popularity, no creative artists existed to challenge their prestige at the courts of philhellenic Emperors, and though the sophists often show jealousy of the philosophers, philosophy without eloquence was nowhere.”

<text>Jacqueline A. Carey (born October 9, 1964) is an American writer, primarily of fantasy fiction.

==Biography==
Carey was born in Highland Park, Illinois, and attended Lake Forest College, both in the northern suburbs of Chicago. She received B.A. degrees in psychology and English literature in 1986. During college she spent 6 months working in a London bookstore as part of a work exchange program, where she decided to write professionally. After returning she started her writing career while working at the art center of a local college. After ten years, she discovered success with the publication of her first book in 2001. Currently, Carey lives in Saugatuck, Michigan and is a member of the oldest Mardi Gras krewe in the state.

==Career==

===Writing===
Carey&#x27;s literary work has been recognized and highlighted at Michigan State University in their Michigan Writers Series.

==Works==

===Terre D&#x27;Ange===
Her first novel was &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Dart&quot;, published by Tor Books in 2001, and the recipient of the 2002 Locus Award for Best First Novel. The &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Legacy&quot; trilogy, completed with &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Chosen&quot; and &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Avatar&quot;, follows the story of a courtesan in a historical fantasy or alternate history (Terre d&#x27;Ange) society that follows a demi-god, Elua, whose precept is &quot;Love as thou wilt&quot;. The map of Terre d&#x27;Ange, the &quot;Land of the Angels,&quot; bears a striking resemblance to that of France. Fictional versions of Greece, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, and Spain also figure prominently in the series. Elua was born when the blood of Yeshua ben Yosef, the son of the one God, mingled with the tears of the Magdelene and carried in the womb of Mother Earth. With Elua&#x27;s peaceful wanderings and the one God&#x27;s rejection of him, seven angels then rejected God to become Elua&#x27;s companions on Earth. These angels and Elua himself then founded a nation and comingled with humans before leaving. D&#x27;Angelines are the people from their descent.

The first trilogy, &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, begins with the story of Phèdre nò Delaunay, a courtesan&#x27;s flawed and unwanted daughter who is sold into indentured servitude. The first book of the trilogy, &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Dart&quot;, will be retold from the point of view of Joscelin Verreuil, a warrior and protector of Phèdre, in an upcoming addition to the trilogy titled &quot;Cassiel&#x27;s Servant&quot;.

The second trilogy (named &quot;Treason&#x27;s Heir&quot; in the UK and frequently dubbed the &quot;Imriel Trilogy&quot; in North America), is a continuation of the storyline started in &quot;Kushiel&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. The main protagonist is Imriel nò Montrève de la Courcel, third in line for the throne of Terre d&#x27;Ange and adopted son of Phèdre nò Delaunay de Montrève.

The third trilogy, whose third novel &quot;Naamah&#x27;s Blessing&quot; came out in June 2011, takes place a century after both trilogies and features the protagonist Moirin of the Maghuinn Dhon. Moirin is half-D&#x27;Angeline and half of the Maghuin Donn. She is touched by the blessing of Naamah as well as her diadh-anam, the bear-goddess of the Maghuin Dhonn. After a terrible accident and the revelation that her father is a priest of Naamah, Moirin sets sail for Terre d&#x27;Ange in search of a destiny her bear-goddess has foretold. Instead of a seemingly clear destiny, Moirin finds herself in an entanglement of court intrigue, scandal and passion. Tossed between the Queen and her courtier, Moirin must decide which path to take before she bleeds dry in the process. She also meets Lo Feng, a sort-of priest of Ch&#x27;in, present day China. Feng teaches our heroine the five styles of breathing and offers a respite from her complicated court life. In following her destiny, she will also follow Feng and his young apprentice across yet another ocean where she will meet a princess possessed by a dragon. This is just the first test Moirin will encounter along her destiny&#x27;s path. She discovers through her diadh-anam that her true love has never been far away. She will travel through cities, deserts and vast areas in an attempt to join the two together. Through her travels, she will always remember that she still has unfinished business back in Terre d&#x27;Ange before she can ever hope to see her mother again.

According to &quot;Publishers Weekly,&quot; &quot;Carey&#x27;s triumph as a writer lies in her ability to turn these stock—nearly stereotyped—components into an engaging, fascinating novel.&quot;
===Other===
Carey&#x27;s second fantasy series is &quot;The Sundering&quot;, consisting of &quot;Banewreaker&quot;, published in 2004, and &quot;Godslayer&quot;, published in 2005. It is a story in the vein of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, but told as a tragedy from the point of view of the &quot;dark&quot; side.

Carey&#x27;s third series begins with &quot;Santa Olivia&quot;, published in 2009 and concludes with its sequel, &quot;Saints Astray&quot;, in 2011. Through a Facebook contest, Carey offered fans the chance to choose a new name for the sequel to &quot;Santa Olivia&quot;, as her publishers were not happy with the working title. The new title of &quot;Saints Astray&quot; was announced on her Facebook fan page on August 27, 2010.

Carey&#x27;s first standalone novel, &quot;Miranda and Caliban&quot; was published in 2017. It&#x27;s a retelling of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, about Prospero&#x27;s daughter Miranda and her friendship with the strange, feral boy Caliban.

<text>Nicholas Bullingham (or Bollingham) (c. 1520–1576) was an English cleric who became the Bishop of Lincoln and Bishop of Worcester.

==Life==

Nicholas Bullingham was born in Worcester around 1520. He was sent to the Royal Grammar School Worcester. In 1536 he became a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, graduating BCL in 1541, DCL in 1546 (or he supplicated for DCL but was not admitted). He was created LL.D. at Cambridge in 1559 (incorporated DCL at Oxford in 1566).

After his education in law, Bullingham entered the church, becoming Archdeacon of Lincoln in 1549. On the accession of Queen Mary, Bullingham, being married and Protestant, was deprived of the archdeaconry and his other church positions, and went into exile at Emden.

On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, Bullingham returned to England, resumed his church positions, and became a private chaplain to Archbishop Parker, who often consulted him on legal matters. He became Bishop of Lincoln in 1560, and finally returned to his old city as Bishop of Worcester until his death in 1576. While in Worcester, he greeted the Queen on her visit to the city in 1575.

Bullingham is buried in Worcester Cathedral in an unusual tomb, with an inscribed tablet on his stomach.

==Marriages and issue==
Bullingham married firstly Margaret Sutton (d.1566), daughter of Hamond Sutton of Washingborough, Lincolnshire, by whom he had two sons, Francis Bullingham (1553–c.1636) and Nicholas Bullingham (1566–1639), and two daughters, both named Susan, who died in 1561 and 1564 respectively.

He married secondly, about 1569, Elizabeth Lok (1535–c.1581). She was the widow of the London mercer and alderman Richard Hill (d.1568), by whom she had had thirteen children, and was the daughter of Sir William Lok and his first wife, Alice Spenser (d.1522). By his second wife Bullingham had a son, John (baptized 1570).

<doc id="711775" wikidata="Q1297794" url="?curid=711775" title="Egide Walschaerts">
<text>Egide Walschaerts (21 January 1820 – 18 February 1901) was a Belgian mechanical engineer, best known as the inventor of the Walschaerts valve gear used in steam locomotives. He was born in Mechelen, Belgium. In 1838 he was recognised as an excellent modeller, presenting his work at a local exhibition in Mechelen. Minister Rogier, who opened the exhibition, was so impressed that he arranged a place for Walschaerts at Liège University.

==Career==
In 1842 he joined the Belgian State Railways and two years later had reached the rank of foreman. He was made chief superintendent of the works shortly after but mysteriously, for such a meteoric early career, never rose any higher. He held this position for the rest of his life, first at Mechelen and then at Brussels South.

===Walschaerts valve gear===

Whilst at Mechelen in 1844 he developed a new type of valve gear (a mechanism that allows for adjustment of the travel of the valves that distribute the steam to the cylinders and enables a steam locomotive to be put into reverse and to economise steam). He was not permitted by the company to patent the device himself as he was deemed of too lowly a rank. An engineer colleague and friend, M. Fisher, applied for the patent on his behalf but never claimed any contribution to it. Walschaerts&#x27;s name on the documents erroneously omitted the final &#x27;s&#x27; causing confusion over its correct spelling over the succeeding years. A locomotive built at the Tubize workshops fitted with the Walschaerts valve gear was awarded a gold medal at the 1873 Universal Exhibition in Vienna. This valve gear came to be used in the majority of steam locomotives, and became almost universal throughout the 20th Century.

===Other innovations===
According to Payen, in 1874 Walschaerts developed a particularly successful version of the Corliss stationary engine that won a gold medal at the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris.

===Commemoration===
Both of the municipalities in which he worked have named streets after him: Mechelen and St Gillis/St-Gilles in Brussels (Egide is a form of the name Giles).

<doc id="711783" wikidata="Q1992685" url="?curid=711783" title="Splint (medicine)">
<text>A splint is defined as &quot;a rigid or flexible device that maintains in position a displaced or movable part; also used to keep in place and protect an injured part&quot; or as &quot;a rigid or flexible material used to protect, immobilize, or restrict motion in a part&quot;. Splints can be used for injuries that are not severe enough to immobilize the entire injured structure of the body. For instance, a splint can be used for certain fractures, soft tissue sprains, tendon injuries, or injuries awaiting orthopedic treatment. A splint may be static, not allowing motion, or dynamic, allowing controlled motion. Splints can also be used to relieve pain in damaged joints. Splints are quick and easy to apply and do not require a plastering technique. Splints are often made out of some kind of flexible material and a firm pole-like structure for stability. They often buckle or Velcro together.

== Uses ==

* By the emergency medical services or by volunteer first responders, to temporarily immobilize a fractured limb before transportation;
* By allied health professionals such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists and orthotists, to immobilize an articulation (e.g. the knee) that can be freed while not standing (e.g. during sleep);
* By athletic trainers to immobilize an injured bone or joint to facilitate safer transportation of the injured person; or
* By emergency department (ED) physicians to stabilize fractures or sprains until follow-up appointment with an orthopedist.

==Types==

* Ankle stirrup – Used for the ankles.
* Finger splints – Used for the fingers. A &quot;mallet&quot; or baseball finger is a rupture of the extensor tendon and sometimes including a fracture. While surgery may be necessary such an injury may heal if placed in a finger splint. 
* Nasal splint
* Posterior lower leg
* Posterior full leg
* Posterior elbow
* Sugar tong – Used for the forearm or wrist. They are named &quot;sugar-tong&quot; due to their long, U-shaped characteristics, similar to a type of utensil used to pick up sugar cubes.
* Thumb spica – Used for the thumb.
* Ulnar gutter – Used for the forearm to the palm.
* Volar wrist splint – Used for the wrist.
* Wrist/arm splint – Used for the wrist or arm.

==History==

=== B.C. to A.D. ===
Splinting has been used since ancient times. Evidence suggests that splint usage dates back to 1500 B.C. that could treat not only fractures but burns as well. These splints were made from materials like, &quot;leaves, reeds, bamboo, and bark padded with linen … [and] copper.&quot; Mummies from Egypt have been uncovered wearing splints from previous injuries that were obtained in their lifetime. Hippocrates, alive from 460 to 377 B.C., was very well known for his discoveries and techniques for splinting. He created a &quot;distraction splint&quot; that was advanced for his time. The splint, made up of leather cuffs that were separated by slim wooden slats, worked to repair the fracture and realign the bones. Around 1000 A.D. the use of Hippocrates&#x27; splinting technique using plants, like palm branches and cane halves, continued to be practiced. Flour dust, egg whites, and vegetable mixtures were created to form plaster for creating splints. Most splints in ancient times were cast-like and made to immobilize an area of the body. This is illustrated by the Aztecs around 1400 A.D. They made splints with leaves, leather, and paste.

=== 1500s ===
In the early 1500s gunpowder was introduced to Europe which caused a serious decline in the market of armor making. Armor makers had to figure out how to make a living with the skills they had already acquired. This led to the creation of braces due to the common use of metal in braces. Armor makers were knowledgeable in areas of the exterior anatomy and joint alignment, making braces the obvious replacement for their armor making. In 1517, after the evolution of the armor trade, injuries were being treated by metal braces secured by screws. Jumping to 1592, the first written piece on splints by surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius, shows various drawings of armor-like splints for the entire body.

=== 1700s–1800s ===
In the mid-1700s, doctors and mechanics worked with each other to create splints for certain injuries. Surgeons need these mechanics to design and build the splints for them. Most splints were made of metal. Plaster of Paris, a white powdery substance used mostly for casts and molds in the form of a quick-setting paste with water, began to be used for immobilizing splints. This method was not a popular way of splinting as it took too long to dry and suitable fabric was sparse.

In the 1800s it was beginning to be recognized that rehabilitation after an injury was important. Orthopedics started to become a separate field from general surgery. A famous British Surgeon, Hugh Owen Thomas, created specialty splints that were cheap and best for injuries that were being rehabilitated. By 1883, mechanics and surgeons separated due to class issues. This created two different areas that shaped the way braces were being created and distributed. Around 1888, F. Gustav Ernst, a dedicated mechanic, released a book illustrating upper body splints. In 1899, orthopedic surgeon Alessandro Codivilla followed suit and published a book explaining the importance of using surgical procedures to set up better results using splints.

<doc id="711785" wikidata="Q324583" url="?curid=711785" title="PCLinuxOS">
<text>PCLinuxOS, often shortened to PCLOS, is a rolling release Linux distribution for x86-64 computers, with KDE Plasma, MATE, and XFCE as its default user interfaces. It is a primarily FOSS operating system for personal computers aimed at ease of use.

==History==
The precursor to PCLinuxOS was a set of RPM packages created to improve successive versions of Mandrake Linux (later Mandriva Linux). These packages were created by Bill Reynolds, a packager better known as &quot;Texstar&quot;. From 2000 to 2003, Texstar maintained his repository of RPM packages in parallel with the PCLinuxOnline site. In an interview, Texstar said he started PCLinuxOS &quot;to provide an outlet for [his] crazy desire to package source code without having to deal with egos, arrogance, and politics.&quot;

In October 2003, Texstar created a fork of Mandrake Linux 9.2. Working closely with the Live CD Project, Texstar has since developed that fork independently into a full-fledged distribution. The initial releases were successively numbered as &quot;previews&quot;: p5, p7, p8, up to p81a, then p9, p91, p92, and p93.

Although it retains a similar &quot;look and feel&quot; to Mandriva Linux, PCLinuxOS has diverged significantly. The code was officially forked from Mandrake 9.2 into an independent project in 2003. After three years of continuous development, the developers took advantage of further development in (the renamed) Mandriva late in 2006 for PCLinuxOS 2007. In the releases before 2007, it was normally necessary to perform a re-installation.

===PCLinuxOS 2007===
For 2007, PCLinuxOS used a one-time source code snapshot from Mandriva to produce a new independent code base (no longer a fork of Mandriva). This implied a shift to a more modern code, which required a complete reinstallation of this version. The new version featured a new look and built-in 3D effects. A new logo was also designed for the new version and was incorporated into the boot screen. A new login screen was designed, entitled &quot;Dark&quot;. The final/official PCLinuxOS 2007 version was released on May 21, 2007.

===PCLinuxOS 2009===
The last version of the 2009 Live CD, PCLinuxOS 2009.2, was released on June 30, 2009. Improvements included bug fixes, new backgrounds, sounds, and start-up screen, as well as quicker start-up times. It was the last PCLinuxOS live CD to ship with K Desktop Environment 3, and the last of the PCLinuxOS 2007 backward compatible series.

Remasters of PCLinuxOS, featuring the Xfce (Phoenix), LXDE (PCLinuxOS-LXDE), and Gnome (PCLinuxOS-Gnome) desktops were also made available.

===PCLinuxOS 2010===
The 2010 version of the Live CD was released on April 19, 2010. It includes the new KDE SC 4.4.2, a new graphical theme and a new version of the Linux Kernel (Kernel 2.6.32.11). It is also the first PCLinuxOS Live CD to include the ext4 file system support. This version required a complete reinstall of the operating system.

While a version of PCLinuxOS that features the GNOME desktop environment was introduced in 2008, the 2010 version is the first one to not only offer the KDE Plasma and GNOME versions, but also versions with Xfce, LXDE, Enlightenment, and Openbox.

===PCLinuxOS 2010.1===
Version 2010.1 was released on May 5, 2010. Changes made since the last version:
* [The] Kernel has been updated to version 2.6.32.12-bfs.
* KDE Plasma Desktop has been upgraded to version 4.4.3.
* Support has been added for Realtek RTL8191SE/RTL8192SE WiFi cards and Microdia webcams.
* Vim console text editor and udftools have been added.
* Fixed CD-ROM ejection when using the Copy to RAM feature.
* Fixed KDE new widget download. Updated nVIDIA (195.36.24) and ATi fglrx (8.723) drivers.
* Updated all supporting applications and libraries from the software repository which include security updates and bug fixes.

===PCLinuxOS 2011.6===
PCLinuxOS 2011.6 version was released on June 27, 2011.

===PCLinuxOS 2012===
PCLinuxOS 2012.02 version was released on February 22, 2012. Later another maintenance release was made on August 22, 2012. Major changes compared to the 2011 release are:
* Kernel has been updated to version 3.2
* KDE version 4.8.2
* nVIDIA and ATi fglrx driver support
* KDE Settings set to dark by default

===PCLinuxOS 2013 64-bit===
PCLinuxOS 2013 64-bit first version was released on April 10, 2013.

It featured:
* Kernel 3.2.18-pclos2.bfs for maximum desktop performance.
* Full KDE 4.10.1 Desktop.
* NVIDIA and ATi fglrx driver support.
* Multimedia playback support for many popular formats.

* LibreOffice Manager can install LibreOffice supporting over 100 languages.
* MyLiveCD allows you to take a snapshot of your installation and burn it to a LiveCD/DVD.
* PCLinuxOS-liveusb – allows you to install PCLinuxOS on a USB key disk.

===PCLinuxOS 2014.7===

The new version was released on July 7, 2014.

Features:
* kernel 3.15.4 for maximum desktop performance.
* Full KDE 4.12.3 Desktop.
* Nvidia and ATI fglrx driver support.
* Multimedia playback support for many popular formats.
* Wireless support for many network devices.
* Printer support for many local and networked printer devices.
* Addlocale allows you to convert PCLinuxOS into over 60 languages.

* MyLiveCD allows you to take a snapshot of your installation and burn it to a LiveCD/DVD.
* PCLinuxOS-liveusb allows you to install PCLinuxOS on a USB key disk.

==Features==
PCLinuxOS places specific emphasis on desktop computing, concentrating its efforts on home or small business environments, hence paying less attention to other more &quot;traditional&quot; uses, like servers, although packages for most server tasks are available.

PCLinuxOS is distributed as a Live CD, which can also be installed on a local hard disk drive or USB flash drive. Beginning from version 2009.1 PCLinuxOS provides a USB installer to create a Live USB, where the user&#x27;s configuration and personal data can be saved if desired. A live USB of older versions of PCLinuxOS can be created manually or with UNetbootin. The entire CD can be run from memory, assuming the system has sufficient RAM. PCLinuxOS uses APT-RPM, based on APT (Debian), a package management system (originally from the Debian distribution), together with Synaptic Package Manager, a GUI to APT, to add, remove or update packages. If there is enough memory on the machine, and an active network connection, the Live CD can update packages. PCLinuxOS is also designed to be easy to remaster after installation, creating one&#x27;s personalized Live CD, using the mylivecd tool.

PCLinuxOS maintains its software repository, available via the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) and its Synaptic front-end, completely replacing Mandriva&#x27;s urpmi. This means that an installation could be continuously updated to the latest versions of packages, hence sometimes forgoing the need to re-install the entire distribution upon each successive release. Other differences include its menu arrangement, custom graphics and icon sets.

===End of official support for 32-bit version===
On May 10, 2016, main developer Texstar announced the end of support for 32-bit versions of PCLinuxOS. As a result, 32-bit ISOs of the distribution, official 32-bit package updates, and forum support became unavailable. While this doesn&#x27;t prevent unofficial support, following the announcement only 64-bit ISO images and package updates are available through the official webpage and channels.

== Other versions ==
There are several community projects associated with PCLinuxOS.

===Trinity edition===
The Trinity edition of PCLinuxOS comes in two flavors. &quot;Mini&quot; is a minimalist ISO intended for those who want to customize their desktop with only the programs they want. &quot;Big Daddy&quot;, on the other hand, comes with many programs pre-installed, including, but not limited to multimedia codecs and office software.

===LXQt edition===
The LXQt edition on PCLinuxOS comes with LXQt&#x27;s suite of applications and several third-party applications pre-installed. 

===KDE4 FullMonty (FM) edition (Discontinued)===
KDE FullMonty (Live &amp; Install DVD) was a regular PCLinuxOS KDE4 installation but was modified to include a special desktop layout and many additional applications and drivers preinstalled. PCLinuxOS officially discontinued the FullMonty edition in 2017 due to KDE developers discontinuing support for KDE4.

===Third-party distributions===

Because PCLinuxOS includes the mklivecd script, there have been several third-party distributions over the years based on PCLinuxOS, though they are permitted to mention that connection only if they follow strict guidelines.

==Release history==
Almost all major releases have been accompanied by new boot-up and login screens, along with some changes in icon sets, and login sounds.

<text>The Rockwell AIM-65 computer is a development computer introduced in 1978 based on the MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. The AIM-65 is essentially an expanded KIM-1 computer. Available software included a line-oriented machine code monitor, BASIC interpreter, assembler, Pascal, PL/65, and Forth development system. Available hardware included a floppy disk controller and a backplane for expansion.

== Features ==
Rockwell advertised the $375 AIM-65, with 1K RAM, as an &quot;easy, inexpensive [computer] ... for learning, designing, work or just fun&quot;. Standard software included the system console monitor software in ROM, called Advanced Interactive Monitor. It featured an assembler, disassembler, setting and viewing memory and registers, starting execution of other programs and more. Single stepping was made possible using non-maskable interrupt (NMI). The command prompt was the less-than sign &quot;&lt;&quot;, and on receiving a single character command, it added this input character and the greater-than sign &quot;&gt;&quot;. If the thermal printer was turned on, this would be output on a single line. The monitor included a number of service routines that could be accessed and used by a user&#x27;s program to control I/O and code execution and was fully documented, including source code.

The machine featured dual cassette tape controls. This made it possible to write large assembly programs using the two-pass assembler ROM. Source code in text was written twice consecutively to the input tape, and then the assembler, which could start/stop the input cassette tape using motor control, was invoked. During the first pass, the symbol table was built and stored in RAM. During the second pass, symbols would be translated and code written out on the second tape, also using start/stop motor control. Being able to avoid storing code in RAM made it possible to save a lot of space. It was, however, still important to keep the symbols list short since RAM size was often no more than 4 KB.

In 1981, Rockwell introduced an improved model with a 40-character display as the AIM-65/40. An industrial chassis version was known as the System 65 and included a PROM burner and floppy drives. Rockwell was also a pioneer in solid-state storage devices, introducing &quot;bubble memory&quot; non-volatile expansion boards in 1980.

Micro Technology Unlimited (MTU) made a &quot;Visible Memory&quot; card in 1978 that worked with the KIM-1 and AIM-65 computers, providing raster graphics display capability. MTU also made the first real-time music synthesizer for a microcomputer; it worked with the KIM-1 and AIM-65 and featured a DAC with software providing 4 voices of wavetable-lookup synthesis.

In Spain, they were distributed by Comelta. This company made various card expansions:
*CR-106 8 Kbytes of RAM
*CR-119 RAM / ROM / PROM expansion
*CR-120 Universal programming
*CR-115 Microcassette controller(two units)
*CR-113 Video controller
*CR-401 Board Bus Extension(Standard S-64)

Comelta assembled all the options in a single box to produce a new computer, the Comelta Drac-1. The first prototype used microcassettes, but definitive versions have two 8&quot; floppy disk drives.

In the late 1970s, the Rockwell AIM-65 and its successor, System 65, became the first computers used to board a float in the Tournament of Roses Parade. Cal Poly universities wrote their own animation control language to control hydraulic and motor actuators on floats for many years. In 2003, some of these 27-year-old computers were still in use, controlling various displays and creatures at a high-tech Halloween show near Alexandria, Virginia, U.S.

==Technical specifications==
* Built-in full-sized QWERTY keyboard
* 20 character alphanumeric LED display (16 segments)
* Integrated 20 character thermal printer
* 20 mA current-loop serial interface (can be adapted to RS-232)
* Expansion connector
* Application connector with 6522 VIA chips
* 4 KB RAM
* 5 sockets for 4 KB ROM/EPROM chips

==Reception==
&quot;Compute!&quot; stated that the monitor was by itself almost worth the price of the AIM-65. It concluded that the computer was &quot;an excellent value at the $375 needed for minimum configurations&quot;.

== Programming ==
&quot;PL/65&quot; was a programming language designed and implemented by Rockwell International for the AIM-65.
It is based on a mix of ALGOL and PL/I, simplified where possible in order to adapt to the limited processing environment afforded by the 6502 (64k memory for instance).

Some models had Forth as the built-in language.

==Emulation==
AIM-65 can be emulated using the MESS Emulator. But that emulation lacks printer support. Also, the Sysinfo.dat file states that &quot;we would suffer from support for intelligent terminals as test equipment.&quot;

<doc id="711797" wikidata="Q201884" url="?curid=711797" title="Isogloss">
<text>An isogloss, also called a heterogloss, is the geographic boundary of a certain linguistic feature, such as the pronunciation of a vowel, the meaning of a word, or the use of some morphological or syntactic feature. Isoglosses are a subject of study in dialectology, in which they demarcate the differences between regional dialects of a language; in areal linguistics, in which they represent the extent of borrowing of features between languages in contact with one another; and in the wave model of historical linguistics, in which they indicate the similarities and differences between members of a language family.

Major dialects are typically demarcated by &quot;bundles&quot; of isoglosses, such as the Benrath line that distinguishes High German from the other West Germanic languages and the La Spezia–Rimini Line that divides the Northern Italian languages and Romance languages west of Italy from Central Italian dialects and Romance languages east of Italy. However, an &quot;individual&quot; isogloss may or may not have any coterminus with a language border. For example, the front-rounding of /y/ cuts across France and Germany, while the /y/ is absent from Italian and Spanish words that are cognates with the /y/-containing French words.

One of the best-known isoglosses is the centum-satem isogloss.

Similar to an isogloss, an isograph is a distinguishing feature of a writing system. Both concepts are also used in historical linguistics.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;isogloss&quot; (Ancient Greek &quot;ísos&quot; &quot;equal, similar&quot; and &quot;glōssa&quot; &quot;tongue, dialect, language&quot;) is inspired by contour lines, or isopleths, such as isobars. However, the isogloss separates rather than connects points. Consequently, it has been proposed for the term &quot;heterogloss&quot; ( &quot;héteros&quot; &quot;other&quot;) to be used instead.

==Examples==

===Centum–satem isogloss===
The centum–satem isogloss of the Indo-European language family relates to the different evolution of the dorsal consonants of Proto-Indo-European (PIE). In the standard reconstruction, three series of dorsals are recognised:

In some branches (for example Greek, Italic and Germanic), the palatals merged with the velars: PIE &quot;tremble (inwardly)&quot; became Latin cupiō&quot; &quot;desire&quot; and &quot;hundred&quot; became Latin centum&quot; (pronounced [kentum]); but &quot;interrogative pronoun&quot; became &quot;quō&quot; &quot;how? where?&quot;. They are known as &quot;centum&quot; branches, named after the Latin word for &quot;hundred&quot;.

In other branches (for example, Balto-Slavic and Indo-Iranian), the labiovelars merged with the velars: PIE became Vedic Sanskrit kopáyati&quot; &quot;shaken&quot; and became Avestan &quot;kō&quot; &quot;who?&quot;; but became Avestan satəm&quot;. They are known as &quot;satem&quot; branches, after the Avestan word for &quot;hundred&quot;.

Since the Balto-Slavic family, the Indo-Iranian family, and the other &quot;satem&quot; families are spoken in adjacent geographic regions, they can be grouped by an isogloss: a geographic line separating &quot;satem&quot; branches on one side from &quot;centum&quot; branches on the other.

===North–Midland isogloss (American English)===
A major isogloss in American English has been identified as the North–Midland isogloss, which demarcates numerous linguistic features, including the Northern Cities vowel shift: regions north of the line (including Western New York; Cleveland, Ohio; lower Michigan; northern Illinois; and eastern Wisconsin) have the shift, while regions south of the line (including Pennsylvania, central and southern Ohio, and most of Indiana) do not.

===Northwest Semitic===
A feature of the ancient Northwest Semitic languages is &quot;w&quot; becoming &quot;y&quot; at the beginning of a word. Thus, in Proto-Semitic and subsequent non-Northwest Semitic languages and dialects, the root letters for a word for &quot;child&quot; were &quot;w-l-d&quot;. However, in the ancient Northwest Semitic languages, the word was &quot;y-l-d&quot;, with &quot;w-&quot; &gt; &quot;y-&quot;.

Similarly, Proto-Semitic &quot;ā&quot; becomes &quot;ō&quot; in the Canaanite dialects of Northwest Semitic. Within the Aramaic languages and dialects of Northwest Semitic, the historic &quot;ā&quot; is preserved. Thus, an ancient Northwest Semitic language whose historic &quot;ā&quot; became &quot;ō&quot; can be classed as part of the Canaanite branch of Northwest Semitic.

Such features can be used as data of fundamental importance for the purposes of linguistic classification.

==Isographs==
Just as there are distinguishing features of related languages, there are also distinguishing features of related scripts.

For example, a distinguishing feature of the Iron Age Old Hebrew script is that the letters &quot;bet&quot;, &quot;dalet&quot;, &quot;ayin&quot; and &quot;resh&quot; do not have an open head, but contemporary Aramaic has open-headed forms. Similarly, the &quot;bet&quot; of Old Hebrew has a distinctive stance (it leans to the right), but the &quot;bet&quot; of the Aramaic and Phoenician scripts series has a different stance (in both, it leans to the left).

In 2006, Christopher Rollston suggested using the term &quot;isograph&quot; to designate a feature of the script that distinguishes it from a related script series, such as a feature that distinguishes the script of Old Hebrew from Old Aramaic and Phoenician.

<text>A sarong or a sarung (, ) is a large tube or length of fabric, often wrapped around the waist, worn in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, Northern Africa, East Africa, West Africa, and on many Pacific islands. The fabric often employs woven plaid or checkered patterns or may be brightly colored by means of batik or ikat dyeing. Many modern sarongs have printed designs, often depicting animals or plants. Different types of sarongs are worn in different places in the world, notably the lungi in the Indian subcontinent and the izaar in the Arabian Peninsula.

The unisex sarong is typically longer than the men&#x27;s lungi.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;sarong&quot; is a loanword from Malay (, old spelling: ), meaning &#x27;to cover&#x27; or &#x27;to sheath&#x27;. It was first used in 1834 referring to the skirt-like garment of the Malays. &quot;Sarong&quot; is the older Malay spelling, still used colloquially and persists in English, while () is the standardised form of the word.

Variants of the term are found across Asia, such as Tamil (), Arabic (); and Sinhala ().

In West Africa, the word &quot;srong&quot; or &quot;sorong&quot; is found in the Akan language, and this word means &quot;the highest point&quot;, in reference to the garment being fastened at the very top in order to secure it.

== Overview ==
&quot;Sarong&quot; or &quot;sarung&quot; denotes the lower garment worn by Southeast Asian men and women. This consists of a length of fabric about a yard (0.91 m) wide and two-and-a-half yards (2.3 m) long. In the center of this sheet, across the narrower width, a panel of contrasting color or pattern about one foot wide is woven or dyed into the fabric, which is known as the or &quot;head&quot; of the sarong. This sheet is stitched at the narrower edges to form a tube. One steps into this tube, brings the upper edge above the level of the navel (the hem should be level with the ankles), positions the at the center of the back, and folds in the excess fabric from both sides to the front center, where they overlap and secure the sarong by rolling the upper hem down over itself. Malay men wear sarongs woven in a check pattern, while women wear sarongs dyed in the batik method. However, in Javanese culture, the wearing of batik sarongs is common and not restricted to a particular gender; sometimes they are also worn on formal occasions such as weddings.

The sarong is common wear for women in formal settings with a blouse. Malay men wear sarongs in public only when attending Friday prayers at the mosque, but sarongs remain very common casual wear at home for men of all ethnicities and religions in Brunei, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and much of the Indian subcontinent. (In the Indian subcontinent, excluding Sri Lanka, sarongs are sometimes known as &quot;mundu&quot; or &quot;lungi&quot;.)

==Regional variations==
=== Arabian Peninsula ===
Sarongs known under a variety of local names are traditionally worn by the people of Yemen and elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula. Local names for the garment include , , &quot;izaar&quot;, , &quot;maqtab&quot; and (pl. ). In Hadhramout, Yemen sarongs are called Saroon ( ) in the interior and the coastal region. In Oman, sarongs are called and are often white in color, similar to the Keralan &quot;mundu&quot; of the Indian subcontinent and it is usually worn under the Thawb. In Saudi Arabia, sarongs are known as &quot;izaar&quot;. Designs can be checkered or striped as well floral or arabesque, but double plaid (i.e., a vertical section of the with a different plaid pattern) designs from Indonesia are also very popular. In southwestern Saudi Arabia, tribal groups have their own style of unstitched , which is locally woven. This is also worn in northern Yemen. However, the tribal groups in Yemen each have their own design for their , the latter of which may include tassels and fringes. It is thought that this tribal resembles the original as worn on the Arabian Peninsula since pre-Islamic times such as the Shendyt. They are generally worn open and unstitched in such a way that the garment does not reach over one&#x27;s ankles. Other , often imported from Bangladesh, are the traditional clothing of Arab fishermen of the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. It was the traditional garment for men before the introduction of pant-like pajamas and kaftans during the Turkish and European colonial periods. Tube-stitched, as well as open sarongs, are both worn, even informal dishdasha-wearing countries, as casual sleepwear and at home.

===Indian subcontinent===

Sarongs, very similar to those of South-East Asia and completely different from the Indian subcontinent (excluding Sri Lanka) are widespread – in the state of Manipur, where they are called and &quot;mekhela&quot; in Assam which are very similar to traditional attire of other South-East Asian nations. In the South Indian states of Kerala, they are called &quot;mundu&quot; (if fully white or fully black) and &quot;lungi&quot; or &quot;kaili&quot; if coloured, and in Tamil Nadu, they are called &quot;kaili&quot; or &quot;saaram&quot; or &quot;vetti&quot; or &quot;lungi&quot; and are usually worn at home. A standard lungi measures 2.12 by 1.2 metres.

Unlike the brightly colored Southeast Asian sarongs, the Kerala variety (the &quot;mundu&quot;) is more often plain white and is worn for ceremonial or religious purposes. In Kerala, the brightly coloured sarongs are called &quot;kaily&quot; and the white ones are called &quot;mundu&quot;. The more formal, all-white dhoti is worn for formal and religious occasions. While there are dresses based on the &quot;mundu&quot; which can be worn by women, they more commonly wear the sari.

==== Sri Lanka ====
Sarongs are very common in Sri Lanka and worn only by men. (A similar garment is worn by women. However, the women&#x27;s garment is called &quot;redda&quot;, which is a wrap-around skirt.) It is the standard garment for most men in rural and even some urban communities. However, most men of upper social classes (whose public attire is usually trousers) wear the sarong only for ceremonial purposes, as a convenient night garment or only within the confines of the house. The Tamil-speaking communities, the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sri Lankan Moors people also call it or .

Statistically, the number of people wearing sarong as their primary public attire is on the decline in Sri Lanka, the reason being that the sarong carries the stigma of being the attire for less-educated lower social classes. However, there is a trend toward adopting the sarong as a fashionable garment or as a formal garment worn with national pride, only on special occasions. Political and social leaders of Sri Lanka who want to portray their humility and closeness to the common person and their nationalism, choose a variation of the sarong nicknamed the &quot;national&quot; as their public attire.

=== Horn of Africa ===
Sarongs are ubiquitous in Somalia and the Muslim-inhabited areas of the Horn of Africa. Although nomadic and urban Somali men have worn them for centuries in the form of a plain white skirt, the colorful &quot;macawiis&quot; (ma&#x27;awiis) sarong, which is the most popular form of the garment in the region. Before the 1940s, most &quot;macawiis&quot; were made of cotton. However, since the industrialization of the market, they now come in many fabrics and combinations thereof, including polyester, nylon and silk.

Designs vary greatly and range from checkered square motifs with watermarked diamonds and plaid to simple geometric lines. The one constant is that they tend to be quite colorful; black &quot;macawiis&quot; are rare. &quot;Macawiis&quot; in Somalia are worn around the waist and folded several times over to secure their position. They are typically sold pre-sewn as one long circular stretch of cloth, though some vendors offer to sew them as a value-added service.

===Southeast Asia===
====Indonesia====

In Indonesia the sarong is generally known as a (&#x27;sarong cloth&#x27;) except for in Bali where it carries the name , possibly etymologically related to &quot;kemben&quot; (Javanese torso wrap). The sarung or sarong is often described as an Indonesian skirt; it is a large tube or length of fabric, often wrapped around the waist and worn by men and women throughout much of the Indonesian archipelago. The sarong is also commonly described as a unisex tubular skirt.

The most common design of the Indonesian sarong is woven cloth with checkered motifs, usually used by Muslim men for salah prayer. This kind of sarong cloth is stitched together to create a tubular skirt-like lower garment. In Bali, sarongs are not stitched together as a tube, but remain as a piece of cloth to wrap around the waist and secured with a knot.

Other than common checkered motifs, other woven or print methods might be employed, such as batik, ikat, songket, and other kinds of tenun traditional woven clothes. Sarongs are used by various ethnic groups in Indonesia. They are made from a variety of materials such as cotton, polyester or silk. Indonesian women wear traditional costumes called &quot;kebaya&quot; as upper garments, while for lower garments they wear sarongs dyed in the batik method, with flower motifs and in brighter colors. However, in Javanese culture, the wearing of batik sarungs is not restricted to women on formal occasions such as weddings.

In 2019, in an effort to promote and popularize the sarong among its people, the government encouraged Indonesians to wear the sarong in public at least once a month. President Joko Widodo said the sarong is a significant element of Indonesian culture and that wearing it will be a sign of appreciation for sarong craftsmen.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, the sarong is known as a . The word is paired with specific words to specify its type and function such as (a type of sarong with a simple stripe and box pattern), , (woven sarong), (sarong with batik motifs and design, normally worn by women and paired with a kebaya or Baju Kurung) or or (specialized sarong worn by men with Baju Melayu). In the Malaysian state of Sarawak, it is called (for men) and (for women).

Since 2017, special celebrations around Malaysia Day are held to encourage the wearing of sarong in public spaces as well as taking the railway system called the &quot;Keretapi Sarong&quot; (&#x27;Sarong Train&#x27;).

====Philippines====

Sarongs from the Philippines are generally known as &quot;tapis&quot; in Luzon, &quot;alampay&quot; in the Cordilleran highlands, &quot;patadyong&quot; in the islands of Visayas and Sulu, and &quot;malong&quot; in Mindanao. They are worn by both men and women and can be rectangular or tube-like. They can be knee-length or ankle-length and come in various colors that are usually unique to the specific ethnic group that wove them. Among men, the skirt is usually drawn up and tied at the waist (like a &quot;dhoti&quot;), forming a trouser-like clothing known as a &quot;salawal&quot;. They can also serve as shawls or blankets. They were paired with close-fitting shirts or jackets known as &quot;baro&quot; or &quot;bayu&quot;.

Among the Maranao people, the &quot;malong&quot; is featured in the folk dance &quot;kapa malong malong&quot; which shows the various ways that the &quot;malong&quot; can be utilized.

During the Spanish colonial era, the &quot;tapis&quot; was worn over a longer skirt (&quot;saya&quot; or &quot;falda&quot;) due to the shortness of the &quot;tapis&quot; being deemed too immodest by the Spanish clergy to be worn alone. It evolved over time to become part of the traditional Filipino dress for women, the &quot;baro&#x27;t saya&quot;.

===Western world===
In North and South America as well as Europe, hip wraps are worn as beach wear or as a cover-up over swimwear. The wrap is often made of a thin, light fabric, often rayon, and may feature decorative fringing on both sides. They may have ties, which are long thin straps of fabric which the wearer can tie together to prevent the wrap from falling down. These wraps are mostly worn by women as beach cover-ups and do not usually resemble traditional Asian or African sarongs in size, pattern or design. Western men who wear male sarongs are influenced by the Scottish kilt or lavalava within the Polynesian or Samoan culture. Typically sarongs are worn by men when they are at home, the beach, by the pool, or on a cruise.

==Securing==
Numerous tying methods exist to hold a sarong to the wearer&#x27;s body. In some cases, these techniques customarily differ according to the sex of wearer. If a sarong has ties, they may be used to hold it in place. Sarong ties give the wearer a little extra hold and security. If no ties exist, a pin may be used, the fabric may be tightly tucked under itself in layers, the corners of the main sheet may be wrapped around the body and knotted, or a belt may be used to hold the sarong in place.

==In the media==
The American public is most familiar with the sarong for the dozens of films set in the South Seas, most of them romantic dramas made in the 1930s and 1940s. Dorothy Lamour is by far the actress most linked with the garment, which was designed by Edith Head. Lamour starred in multiple films of this genre, starting with &quot;The Hurricane&quot; in 1937. In fact, Lamour was nicknamed &quot;The Sarong Girl&quot; by the press and even wore a sarong on occasion in more traditional films. Among the other actresses to don the sarong for film roles are Maria Montez, Gilda Gray, Myrna Loy, Gene Tierney, Frances Farmer and Movita. Male stars who wore the manly sarongs on film include Jon Hall, Ray Milland, Tyrone Power, Robert Preston and Sabu Dastagir, as well as Ralph Fiennes in &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; and Pierce Brosnan in &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;.

The 2005 documentary film &quot;Soldiers in Sarong&quot;, directed by Lokendra Arambam, depicts the women&#x27;s resistance movement in Manipur, North-East India. The 2020 Indonesian film &quot;Tarung Sarung&quot; depicts a martial arts tradition where combatants are joined together by the garment.

In Singapore, the term &quot;Sarong Party Girl&quot; refers to a local single Singaporean woman especially of Chinese ethnicity who favor socializing and having relationships with expatriate Caucasian men rather than the local ones.

<text>Convergence (sometimes referenced as C*) is the annual net.goth party run by and for members of the alt.gothic and alt.gothic.fashion newsgroup, and other related Usenet newsgroups. Started in 1995, it is a chance for net.goths and others who normally only meet on the Internet to meet. Events at Convergence typically included live bands and club nights, bazaars, fashion, art shows, panels, and tours of goth-themed locales in the host city.

== Location ==

Convergence is a &quot;floating&quot; event. The location for each year voted on by the net.goth community in response to proposals by volunteer committees. So far all have taken place in North America.

== Attendance ==
Convergence was initially proposed and planned by two long-time members of the alt.gothic newsgroup hierarchy, at the time residents of Chicago, as an international gathering of members of the newsgroups and related net.goth groups. It was conceived as an opportunity for those who had previously known each other primarily or exclusively through Internet forums, to meet and get to know each other in person.

There has been considerable debate regarding the extent to which the event should reach out to other on-line gothic communities, as well as members of local non-Internet-based gothic scenes. Some planning committees have made efforts to expand the scope of the event; while others have made similar efforts to restrict advertising to predominantly the founding net.goth communities.

Attendance ranged over the years usually between 300-800, but attendance spiked at Convergence 13 to approximately 1,500.

== Organization ==

There is no formal Convergence organization per se. Since shortly after its inception, the bidding and voting process has been managed by a more-or-less consistent group of volunteers, known informally as the C*b*l, composed of several of the longest-term participants in the alt.gothic newsgroups. The C*b*l is widely recognized as having made some of the most substantial contributions to maintaining Convergence, and are among its most frequent attendees. The group also maintains the official Convergence website, and provides organizational and informational assistance to host committees.

Each Convergence is organized and run by an ad hoc volunteer committee. Committees typically consist of residents of the host city, a large percentage of whom are expected to be active participants on alt.gothic or related net.goth groups.

<text>Andrea Levy (7 March 1956 – 14 February 2019) was an English author best known for the novels &quot;Small Island&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Long Song&quot; (2010). She was born in London to Jamaican parents, and her work explores topics related to British Jamaicans and how they negotiate racial, cultural and national identities.

== Early life ==
Levy was of primarily Afro-Jamaican descent. She had a Jewish paternal grandfather and a Scots maternal great-grandfather. She said in a 2004 article: &quot;Jews went to Jamaica in the 1600s. My paternal grandfather was born Orthodox Jewish, from a very strict family, but after fighting in the First World War he became a Christian and came back and married my grandmother. His family disowned him, so I don&#x27;t know much about them.&quot; Her father came to Britain on the in 1948, with her mother following later that year on a banana boat.

Levy was born in Archway, north London, &quot;the fourth, and baby, of the family, by a long way&quot;. She grew up on a council estate in Highbury, also in north London, and had what she described as &quot;the life of an ordinary London working-class girl&quot;. She attended Highbury Hill Grammar School and studied textile design and weaving at Middlesex Polytechnic.

== Career ==
Levy began her career as a costume assistant, working part-time in the costume departments of the BBC and the Royal Opera House, while starting a graphic design company with her husband Bill Mayblin. During this time, she experienced a form of awakening to her identity concerning both her gender and her race. At a racial-awareness session with colleagues at an Islington sex education project, she found herself having to choose between a &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; side, which she found a &quot;rude awakening&quot;. Having not read a book until the age of 23, she subsequently became aware of the power of books and began to read &quot;excessively&quot;. It was easy enough to find literature by black writers from the United States, but she could find very little literature from black writers in the United Kingdom. (A similar recognition led Marsha Hunt in 1995 to initiate the Saga Prize, for which Levy would become a judge.)

Levy began writing in her mid-30s, after her father died. It was not a therapeutic attempt to deal with her loss, but rather a need to understand where she came from. In 1989, she enrolled in Alison Fell&#x27;s Creative Writing class at the City Lit, continuing with the course for seven years.

Levy struggled initially to get her work published, her first novel being rejected by several companies that were unsure of how to market her writing. She spoke in a 1999 interview of the &quot;herd mentality&quot; of publishers worried about the possibly limited market appeal of her work: &quot;the main problem was that they perceived it as being just about race, and thought it would only appeal to black readers.&quot; However, as Margaret Busby noted, Levy &quot;proved that to write about... migration from the specific yet complex perspective of being a black English female is not a limitation to finding a wide and appreciative readership, but in fact the exact opposite.&quot;

== Work ==
In 1994, Levy&#x27;s first novel, the semi-autobiographical &quot;Every Light in the House Burnin″&quot;, was published and attracted favourable reviews. The &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; stated: &quot;This story of a young girl in the 60s in north London, child of Jamaican migrants, stands comparison with some of the best stories about growing up poor – humorous and moving, unflinching and without sentiment&quot;. Her second novel, &quot;Never Far from Nowhere&quot; (1996), is a coming-of-age story about two sisters of Jamaican parentage, Vivian and Olive, growing up in Finsbury Park, London in the 1970s. It was long-listed for the Orange Prize.

After &quot;Never Far from Nowhere&quot;, Levy visited Jamaica for the first time and what she learned of her family&#x27;s past provided material for her next book, &quot;Fruit of the Lemon&quot; (1999). The novel is set in England and Jamaica during the Thatcher era, highlighting the differences between Jamaican natives and their British descendants. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the novel &quot;illuminates the general situation facing all children of postcolonial immigrants&quot;.

Levy&#x27;s fourth novel, &quot;Small Island&quot; (2004), which looks at the immediate outcomes of World War II and migration on what became known as the Windrush generation, was a critical success. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s reviewer, Mike Phillips, praised the writing and the subject matter, calling it Levy&#x27;s &quot;big book&quot;. Levy herself said in 2004: &quot;When I started &quot;Small Island&quot; I didn&#x27;t intend to write about the war. I wanted to start in 1948 with two women, one white, one black, in a house in Earls Court, but when I asked myself, &#x27;Who are these people and how did they get here?&#x27; I realised that 1948 was so very close to the war that nothing made sense without it. If every writer in Britain were to write about the war years there would still be stories to be told, and none of us would have come close to what really happened. It was such an amazing schism in the middle of a century. And Caribbean people got left out of the telling of that story, so I am attempting to put them back into it. But I am not telling it from only a Jamaican point of view. I want to tell stories from the black and white experience. It is a shared history.&quot; &quot;Small Island&quot; won three awards, the Whitbread Book of the Year, the Orange Prize and the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize. The novel was subsequently made into a two-part television drama of the same title that was broadcast by the BBC in December 2009. A stage adaptation written by Helen Edmundson premiered at the National Theatre&#x27;s Olivier Theatre in 2019, returning in 2022.

Levy&#x27;s fifth and final novel, &quot;The Long Song&quot;, won the 2011 Walter Scott Prize and was shortlisted for the 2010 Man Booker Prize. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it a &quot;sensational novel&quot;. Kate Kellaway in &quot;The Observer&quot; commented: &quot;&quot;The Long Song&quot; reads with the sort of ebullient effortlessness that can only be won by hard work.&quot; The novel was adapted as a three-part BBC One television series that was broadcast in December 2018.

Levy&#x27;s short book &quot;Six Stories and an Essay&quot; was published in 2014. It begins with an autobiographical essay and includes stories that are drawn from various life experiences. Levy contributed to the 2019 anthology &quot;New Daughters of Africa&quot; (edited by Margaret Busby), which has enabled an annual scholarship at SOAS University of London.

Bonnie Greer paid tribute to Andrea Levy: &quot;For every great writer, their own story is in their work, and is all that you really need to know... What she described was a people integral to what the UK is. Now and forever. And their bard, Andrea Levy, is immortal.&quot;

&quot;The Bookseller&quot; noted in 2019 that, in the UK, Levy had sold &quot;a total of 1.23 million books for £7.9m, with &quot;Small Island&quot; her bestseller, selling 758,203 copies in paperback and a further 120,749 for the TV tie-in. It is the biggest-selling winner of the Women&#x27;s Prize to date.&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Documentary film &quot;Andrea Levy: Her Island Story&quot; (2018) ===
Levy was the subject of a film profile entitled &quot;Andrea Levy: Her Island Story&quot;, first shown in December 2018 in Alan Yentob&#x27;s BBC One television arts documentary series &quot;Imagine&quot;.

=== Radio profile &quot;Andrea Levy: In Her Own Words&quot; (2020) ===
The BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Andrea Levy: In Her Own Words&quot; was broadcast on 8 February 2020 in the &quot;Archive on 4&quot; series, drawing on an in-depth interview in 2014 with oral historian Sarah O&#x27;Reilly for the British Library&#x27;s Authors&#x27; Lives project, in which Levy spoke on condition that the recording would only be released after her death. The interview was accompanied by contributions from friends of Levy&#x27;s including Gary Younge, Baroness Lola Young, Louise Doughty, and Margaret Busby, as well as Levy&#x27;s husband Bill Mayblin.

=== Literary archive ===
It was announced in February 2020 that Levy&#x27;s literary archive had been acquired by the British Library, including notebooks, research material, correspondence, emails and audio recordings.

In 2023, the British Library reported that it had recovered previously unknown material from Levy&#x27;s computer, including a planned TV series on nurse Mary Seacole, an early draft of &quot;Small Island&quot;, and work on a factual series on the detailed history of the Caribbean for the BBC that never came to fruition.

=== Commemorative plaque ===
An Islington Heritage Plaque was unveiled in Levy&#x27;s honour on her childhood home at Twyford House, Elwood Street, in Highbury, on 14 March 2020, at a ceremony attended by her husband Bill Mayblin and family members, Islington councillors, Baroness Lola Young, and other friends.

=== Royal Society of Literature pen collection ===
In November 2020 it was announced that Levy would be the first writer of colour whose pen would join the Royal Society of Literature&#x27;s historic collection, which includes pens belonging to George Eliot and Lord Byron.

== Personal life and death ==

Levy was married to Bill Mayblin. She died on 14 February 2019, aged 62, after living with metastatic breast cancer for 15 years, and her ashes were buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>In German linguistics, the Benrath line () is the isogloss: dialects north of the line have the original in (to make), while those to the south have the innovative (). The Line runs from Aachen in the west via Benrath (south of Düsseldorf) to eastern Germany near Frankfurt an der Oder in the area of Berlin and Dessau and through former East Prussia dividing Low Prussian dialect and High Prussian dialect. It is called Benrath line because Benrath is the place where it crosses the Rhine.

The High German consonant shift (3rd to 9th centuries AD), in which the (northern) Low German dialects for the most part did not participate, affected the southern varieties of the West Germanic dialect continuum. This shift is traditionally seen to distinguish the High German varieties from the other West Germanic languages. 

The impact of the High German consonant shift increases gradually to the South. The Benrath line does not mark the northernmost effect of the High German consonant shift, since the Uerdingen line, the &quot;ik–ich&quot; isogloss, lies slightly further north; and some of the peripheral changes associated with the shift did affect Low German.

<doc id="711841" wikidata="Q558564" url="?curid=711841" title="Berkeley r-commands">
<text>The Berkeley r-commands are a suite of computer programs designed to enable users of one Unix system to log in or issue commands to another Unix computer via TCP/IP computer network. The r-commands were developed in 1982 by the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California, Berkeley, based on an early implementation of TCP/IP (the protocol stack of the Internet).

The CSRG incorporated the r-commands into their Unix operating system, the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). The r-commands premiered in BSD v4.1. Among the programs in the suite are: (remote copy), (remote execution), (remote login), (remote shell), , , and (remote who).

The r-commands were a significant innovation, and became &quot;de facto&quot; standards for Unix operating systems. With wider public adoption of the Internet, their inherent security vulnerabilities became a problem, and beginning with the development of Secure Shell protocols and applications in 1995, its adoption entirely supplanted the deployment and use of r-commands (and Telnet) on networked systems.

==Protocol==

The original Berkeley package that provides also features (remote-copy, allowing files to be copied over the network) and rsh (remote-shell, allowing commands to be run on a remote machine without the user logging into it).

As an example, the protocol is as follows:
Client:
&lt;null&gt;
user name on the client&lt;null&gt;
user name on the server&lt;null&gt;
terminal type/terminal baud rate&lt;null&gt;

Server:
The server would check that the user should have access. If so, it returns a message with nothing in it (not even a null character), meaning the connection is established.

For example:
Client:
&lt;null&gt;
bostic&lt;null&gt;
kbostic&lt;null&gt;
vt100/9600&lt;null&gt;

Server:
Both and share the (applies to all users on the server) and (applies to only the user that puts the file in its home folder) access-control scheme, although they connect to different daemons. connects to , while connects to .

 and uses the same format. The following shows some aspects of the format:
host1
host2 user_a
-host3
+@group1 -user_b
-@group2
This allows all users from host1 to login, user_a from host2 to login, no users from host3, all users on group1 except user_b, and no users on group2.

==Commands==
===rlogin===
 enables a user to log in on another server via computer network, using TCP network port 513.

 is also the name of the application layer protocol used by the software, part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Authenticated users can act as if they were physically present at the computer. RFC 1282, in which it was defined, states: &quot;The facility provides a remote-echoed, locally flow-controlled virtual terminal with proper flushing of output.&quot; communicates with a daemon, , on the remote host. is similar to the Telnet command, but is not as customizable and is able to connect only to Unix-like hosts.

===rsh===
 opens a shell on a remote computer without a login procedure. Once connected, the user can execute commands on the remote computer through the shell&#x27;s command-line interface. passes input and output through the standard streams, and it sends standard output to the user&#x27;s console. Over the network, standard input and standard out flow through TCP port 514, while Standard Error flows through a different TCP port, which the daemon () opens.

===rexec===
Like , enables the user to run shell commands on a remote computer. However, unlike the rsh server, the server () requires login: it authenticates users by reading the username and password (unencrypted) from the network socket. uses TCP port 512.

===rcp===
 can copy a file or directory from the local system to a remote system, from a remote system to the local system, or from one remote system to another. The command line arguments of and are similar, but in remote files are prefixed with the name of the remote system:

 rcp file.txt subdomain.domain:~/home/foo/file.txt

As with the Unix copy command cp, overwrites an existing file of the same name in the target; unlike , it provides no mechanism for warning the user before overwriting the target file. Like , uses TCP port 514.

===rwho===
Just as the who command lists the users who are logged in to the local Unix system, lists those users who are logged into all multi-user Unix systems on the local network. &#x27;s daemon, , maintains a database of the status of Unix systems on the local network. The daemon and its database are also used by the program.

===rstat===
 returns performance statistics from the kernel.

===ruptime===
Just as the command shows how long a Unix system has been running since the last restart, requests a status report from all computers on the local network. It then returns the uptime report. If a computer did not respond within the time limit, then reports that the system is down. This information is tracked and stored by the daemon , which is also used by the rwho command.

==Security==
Those r-commands which involve user authentication (, , , and ) share several serious security vulnerabilities:

* All information, including passwords, is transmitted unencrypted (making it vulnerable to interception).
* The (or ) file is easy to misuse. They are designed to allow logins without a password, but their reliance on remote usernames, hostnames, and IP addresses is exploitable. For this reason many corporate system administrators prohibit files, and actively scrutinize their networks for offenders.
* The protocol partly relies on the remote party&#x27;s client to provide information honestly, including source port and source host name. A malicious client can forge this and gain access, as the protocol has no means of authenticating the client is running on a trusted machine. It also cannot check if the requesting client on a trusted machine is the real client, meaning that malicious programs may pretend to be a standard-conforming client by using the same protocols.
* The common practice of mounting users&#x27; home directories via Network File System exposes rlogin to attack by means of fake files - this means that any of its security faults automatically plague .

Due to these problems, the r-commands fell into relative disuse (with many Unix and Linux distributions no longer including them by default). Many networks that formerly relied on and have replaced them with SSH and its -equivalent .

<text>Carl Charles Fontana (July 18, 1928 – October 9, 2003) was an American jazz trombonist. After working in the big bands of Woody Herman, Lionel Hampton, and Stan Kenton, he devoted most of his career to playing music in Las Vegas.

==Career==
Fontana was born in Monroe, Louisiana, United States. His first break into the professional jazz scene came in 1952, when he was hired to stand in for one of Woody Herman&#x27;s regular trombonists, Urbie Green. When Green returned, Herman kept Fontana on as a permanent member of the band.

After three years with Herman, Fontana joined Lionel Hampton&#x27;s big band in 1954. In early 1955, he played briefly with Hal McIntyre and Chicago pianist and Playboy executive, Sam Distefano at Sam&#x27;s Miami nightclub, The Stut &#x27;n&#x27; Tut. He later joined Stan Kenton&#x27;s big band. Fontana recorded three albums with Kenton and worked with trombonist Kai Winding during this period.

After 1958, Fontana rarely toured, but undertook a 1966 tour of Africa with Herman&#x27;s band sponsored by the U.S. State Department. He primarily performed with house orchestras in Las Vegas during the 1960s, particularly Paul Anka&#x27;s band (with Frank Rosolino). He also performed in bands backing Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Bennett, Wayne Newton, and the Benny Goodman orchestra.

In the 1970s, he continued performing in house orchestras and lounges in Las Vegas. He also recorded with Louie Bellson, Bill Watrous, and Supersax. It was not until 1975 that Fontana recorded an album as an ensemble co-leader. He shared the billing for this record, &quot;The Hanna-Fontana Band: Live at Concord&quot; (Concord Jazz) with drummer Jake Hanna. Fontana toured in Japan with this ensemble. In 1978, he was featured on the jazz trombone recording &quot;Bobby Knight&#x27;s Great American Trombone Company&quot;, with Charles Loper, Lew McCreary, Frank Rosolino, Phil Teele, and Bobby Knight.

In the 1980s, he appeared regularly on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Jazz&quot; program. His first album as a headliner was &quot;The Great Fontana&quot; (Uptown Jazz, 1985).

In 2001, he joined The West Coast All Stars and played a concert in Stuttgart, Germany. He was joined by Conte Candoli, Teddy Edwards, Pete Jolly, Chuck Berghofer, and Joe LaBarbera. He was featured on the song &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot;, from the movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

Fontana died October 9, 2003, in Las Vegas, Nevada, aged 75 after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Frank Rosolino (August 20, 1926 – November 26, 1978) was an American jazz trombonist.

==Biography==
Rosolino was born in Detroit, Michigan, United States, He performed with the big bands of Bob Chester, Glen Gray, Tony Pastor, Herbie Fields, Gene Krupa, and Stan Kenton. After a period with Kenton he settled in Los Angeles, where he performed with Howard Rumsey&#x27;s Lighthouse All-Stars (1954–1960) in Hermosa Beach.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, between nightclub engagements, Rosolino was active in many Los Angeles recording studios where he performed with such notables as Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Tony Bennett, Peggy Lee, Mel Tormé, Michel Legrand, and Quincy Jones. In the mid-to-late 1960s he and fellow trombonist Mike Barone, billed as &quot;Trombones Unlimited,&quot; recorded for Liberty Records several albums of pop-style arrangements of current hits, such as the 1968 album &quot;Grazing in the Grass.&quot; He can also be seen performing with Shelly Manne&#x27;s group in the film &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958) starring Susan Hayward, and also in &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957) with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. He was a regular on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; and a guest artist on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. Rosolino was a talented vocalist, renowned for his wild form of scat-singing, notably on Gene Krupa&#x27;s hit record, &quot;Lemon Drop&quot;.

During the 1970s, Rosolino performed and toured with Quincy Jones and the Grammy Award winning group Supersax.

Rosolino&#x27;s private life was deeply troubled. On November 26, 1978, Rosolino shot both of his sons, 11 year old Justin, and 7 year old Jason, as they slept. Justin died instantly; Jason survived, but was blinded. Rosolino fatally shot himself in the head immediately after shooting his sons.

In New Zealand, it is also sometimes called wild parsnip (not to be confused with &quot;Pastinaca sativa&quot;) or wild rhubarb.

Giant hogweed is native to the western Caucasus region of Eurasia. It was introduced to Britain as an ornamental plant in the 19th century, and has also spread to other areas in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada. Its close relatives, Sosnowsky&#x27;s hogweed and Persian hogweed, have similarly spread to other parts of Europe.

The sap of giant hogweed is phototoxic and causes phytophotodermatitis in humans, resulting in blisters and scars. These serious reactions are due to the furanocoumarin derivatives in the leaves, roots, stems, flowers, and seeds of the plant. Consequently, the jurisdictions of many regions consider it a noxious weed.

==Etymology==
The species name &quot;mantegazzianum&quot; refers to Paolo Mantegazza (1831–1910), Italian traveller and anthropologist.

==Description==

Giant hogweed typically grows to heights of . Under ideal conditions, a plant can reach a height of . The leaves are incised and deeply lobed. A mature plant has huge leaves, wide, and a stout, bright green stem with extensive dark reddish-purple splotches and prominent coarse white hairs, especially at the base of the leaf stalk. Hollow, ridged stems are in diameter, occasionally up to in diameter, and can grow to more than high. Dark red spots on the stem each surround a single hair. The umbrella-shaped inflorescence, called a compound umbel, may be up to in diameter across its flat top. The flowers are white or greenish white and may be radially symmetrical or strongly bilaterally symmetrical (zygomorphic). The fruit is a schizocarp, producing seeds in dry, flattened, oval pairs. The seeds are approximately long, with a broadly rounded base and broad marginal ridges, coloured tan with brown lines (so-called oil tubes) running of the seed&#x27;s length.

===Life cycle===
The life cycle of giant hogweed consists of four phases:

#Pre-flowering plants: In the first year, leaves sprout from the seed. In subsequent years, leaves grow from the overwintering roots, producing a rosette of leaves at ground level with no above-ground stem. This pre-flowering phase can last for several years.
#Flowering plants (midsummer): After several years of growth, the plant flowers, sending up an erect stem from the rootstock.
#Seeds (late summer/early autumn): A flowering plant can produce 20,000 seeds.
#Dead stems (late autumn/winter): After producing seeds, the plant dies, leaving dried stems and seed heads standing; the seeds slowly fall and are dispersed by wind and animals.

During the first few years of growth, the leaves and stem of a pre-flowering plant die over the winter. In the spring, the plant grows back from its root. In other words, the giant hogweed is a herbaceous perennial.

A giant hogweed plant usually produces a flowering stalk in 3–5 years, but plants may take up to eight years to flower if conditions are unfavourable. In the Czech Republic, a single plant reached twelve years old before flowering. In any case, when the plant finally flowers, it does so between June and July (in the northern hemisphere).

Seeds are typically produced in August. A single flowering plant will produce 20,000 seeds on average with seed production varying between 10,000 and 50,000 seeds per plant.

Giant hogweed is a monocarpic perennial, that is, after a mature plant flowers and produces seed, the entire plant dies. During the following winter, tall dead stems mark the locations where the flowering plants once stood.

The seeds are dispersed short distances by wind, but can travel longer distances by water, animals, and people. Most seeds (95%) are found in the top of the soil within a few metres of the parent plant. Seeds may stay alive in the seed bank for more than five years.

A seed deposited in the seed bank is initially dormant. Dormancy is broken by the cold and wet conditions of autumn and winter, and so freshly deposited seeds lie dormant until at least the following spring, at which time approximately 90% of the previously dormant seeds will germinate. The rest remain dormant in the seed bank.

Seeds normally result from cross-pollination between two or more plants but self-pollination is also possible. More than half the seeds produced by self-pollination will germinate and give rise to healthy seedlings. Hence a single isolated seed may give rise to a new colony of plants.

=== Similar species ===
The various species of the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot; are similar in appearance, but vary in size. &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; is among the tallest, typically reaching high (and sometimes more than high), whereas &quot;Heracleum&quot; species native to western Europe, such as &quot;H. sphondylium&quot; ([common] hogweed), or North America, such as &quot;H. maximum&quot; (cow parsnip), rarely exceed high. There are considerable differences in the size of the umbel, leaves, and stem of &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; as well.

The following table compares &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; and &quot;H. maximum&quot; by feature:

Many more species exist; in Europe, over 20 species are found of the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot; alone. Few of these reach a similar size, and several are phototoxic to a lesser degree. Two other species, &quot;H. sosnowskyi&quot; and &quot;H. persicum&quot;, do reach similar sizes, and are equally noxious.

== Distribution ==

Giant hogweed is widespread throughout western and northern Europe, especially along terrains such as coastal areas and riverbanks. By forming dense stands, it can displace native plants and reduce wildlife habitats. It has spread in the northeastern and northwestern United States and southern Canada, and is an invasive species across western Europe; in sites where it has settled, it overtakes the local native species, &quot;H. sphondylium&quot;.

In Canada, the plant occurs in most provinces, except in the prairies. It has been seen in Quebec since the early 1990s. The plant&#x27;s spread in Ontario began in the southwest and was seen in 2010 in the Greater Toronto Area and Renfrew County near Ottawa.

In the US, giant hogweed occurs in Maine, Wisconsin, and south to Indiana, Michigan, Maryland, and New Jersey. In June 2018, it was reported growing in Virginia and North Carolina. The plant is federally listed as a noxious weed in the US.

The closely related hogweed &quot;Heracleum sosnowskyi&quot; is widespread in Russia and the Baltic states, and present in eastern Europe.

=== History ===

&quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot; is native to the western Caucasus region of Eurasia. Because of its impressive size, giant hogweed was brought to Europe and North America as an ornamental plant and garden curiosity.

The following historical information grew out of the European Giant Alien Project, which began in 2005.

==== Migration across Europe ====
&quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot; was first described in scientific literature in 1895, but by that time more than a dozen European countries had already imported the plant as an &quot;ornamental curiosity&quot;. The introduction of &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; was first recorded in Great Britain in 1817 when it was put on the seed list at the Kew Botanic Gardens in London. The first natural population was recorded in 1828, growing wild at Shelford in Cambridgeshire.

The spread of &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; throughout Europe continued unabated until the middle of the 20th century, at which time the dangers of giant hogweed had become more widely known. Despite the warnings, however, the plant continued to be used by gardeners, beekeepers, and farmers (for cattle fodder) for another 50 years. &quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot; was finally delisted by the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain in 2002.

==== Introduction to North America ====
During the 20th century, giant hogweed was transported to the US and Canada for display in arboreta and Victorian gardens. The earliest recorded planting in North America was in 1917, in gardens near Highland Park in the city of Rochester, New York.

By 1950, giant hogweed had appeared in southern Ontario, and within a quarter-century the plant was firmly established in Ontario. It was first collected from Nova Scotia in 1980 and Quebec in 1990. Giant hogweed was still available for sale in Canadian nurseries as late as 2005.

On the west coast of North America, &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; appeared in Oregon, Washington, and southwestern Canada, but it is not clear how the species found its way into this region. The first reports of giant hogweed in British Columbia were published in the 1930s.

==== Russia ====
&quot;Heracleum mantegazzianum&quot; has not spread in Russia. Another similar very large hogweed species, &quot;H. sosnowskyi&quot;, also native to the Caucasus region, was introduced into Russian agriculture starting from 1947 as a fodder plant and later spread extensively on its own throughout Russia and some other countries of eastern Europe.

== Ecology ==

=== As an invasive plant ===
Because of its phototoxicity and invasive nature, giant hogweed is often actively removed. The European Union funded the &quot;Giant Alien&quot; project to combat the plant. On 2 August 2017, it added the species to its &quot;List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern&quot;, thus placing restrictions on keeping, importing, selling, breeding and growing it, and requiring governments to detect and eradicate it throughout the EU. In the United Kingdom, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to plant or cause giant hogweed to grow in the wild.

In the US, hogweed is regulated as a federal noxious weed, and is illegal to import into the US or move interstate without a permit from the Department of Agriculture (USDA). The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has had an active program to control giant hogweed since 2008. In 2011, Maine state horticulturists reported that it has been found at 21 different locations in Maine, with the number of plants ranging from one to a hundred.

=== Hybrids ===
Hybrids have been reported between invasive specimens of &quot;H. mantegazzianum&quot; and native populations of &quot;H. sphondylium&quot; in Britain; characteristics of such plants tend to be intermediate between the two species. Hybrids only tend to survive where &quot;H. sphondylium&quot; is the maternal plant.

Other specimens have been recorded which have intermediate morphology, but whose hybrid status is uncertain.

== Phototoxicity of sap ==

The sap of the giant hogweed plant is phototoxic. The sap contains furanocoumarins, which leads to phytophotodermatitis, a serious skin inflammation. A phototoxic reaction can begin as soon as 15 minutes after contact with the sap. Photosensitivity peaks between 30 minutes and two hours after contact but can last for several days. Authorities advise that all humans (especially children) should stay away from giant hogweed. Protective clothing, including eye protection, should be worn when handling the plant. Parts of the body that come into contact with the sap of giant hogweed should be immediately washed with soap and cold water, and further exposure to sunlight should be avoided for at least 48 hours. Other &quot;Heracleum&quot; species such as &quot;H. maximum&quot;, are likewise phototoxic, and hence similar caution is advised. Owing to physical similarities to other hogweeds in the genus &quot;Heracleum&quot;, giant hogweed and its close relatives are sometimes mistaken for harmless plants.

Discounting phototoxicity from contact with external tissues, poisoning via ingestion by humans is not known, and consumption of small amounts of the plant is not deemed to be harmful, although should still be avoided due to the obvious extreme hazards created via proximity to the plant. Consumption by some other grazing animals does not appear to cause them harm, and sheep have been trialled as a giant hogweed control agent in Scotland. The USDA Forest Service states that pigs and cattle can eat it without apparent harm.

== In popular culture ==
The 1971 album &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; by the progressive rock group Genesis contains the song &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot;. The darkly humorous lyrics describe an attack on the human race by the hogweed, long after the plant was first &#x27;captured&#x27; and brought to England by a Victorian explorer.

In her 1985 novel &quot;Curse of the Giant Hogweed&quot;, popular mystery author Charlotte MacLeod places her established character Peter Shandy and his colleagues in a fantasy version of Wales to investigate giant hogweed endangering Britain&#x27;s hedgerows.

The plant is featured in season 10, episode 3, of the AMC television series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, growing from zombies which a character encounters, rendering him unable to see properly.

<doc id="711853" wikidata="Q6210684" url="?curid=711853" title="Joe Kieyoomia">
<text>Joe Lee Kieyoomia (November 21, 1919 – February 17, 1997) was a Navajo soldier in New Mexico&#x27;s 200th Coast Artillery unit who was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army after the fall of the Philippines in 1942 during World War II. Kieyoomia was a POW in Nagasaki at the time of the atomic bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell.

The Japanese tried unsuccessfully to have him decode messages in the &quot;Navajo Code&quot; used by the United States Marine Corps, but although Kieyoomia understood Navajo, the messages sounded like nonsense to him because even though the code was based on the Navajo language, it was decipherable only by individuals specifically trained in its usage.

Kieyoomia is notable for having not only survived the Bataan death march and related internment and torture in a concentration camp, but also being a &quot;hibakusha&quot; (survivor of an atomic bomb blast).

==Capture of the Philippine Islands==
The surrender of Bataan would hasten the fall of Corregidor, a month later. Without this final stand however, the Japanese might have quickly overrun all of the U.S. bases in the Pacific. Conflict in Bataan forced them to slow down, giving the allies valuable time to prepare for conflicts such as the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway which followed closely thereafter. Ultimately, Kieyoomia, along with more than 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war were forced into the infamous Bataan Death March.

==Prisoner of war==
Initially tortured because his captors thought he was Japanese-American (and therefore a traitor), Kieyoomia suffered months of harsher punishment and beatings before the Japanese accepted his claim to Navajo ancestry.

He survived the Death March that killed thousands of starved U.S. and Philippine soldiers. When the &quot;Navajo Code&quot; had the Japanese baffled, Kieyoomia was questioned and tortured although, as he was deployed to the Philippines with New Mexico&#x27;s 200th Coast Artillery, he didn&#x27;t even know about the existence of the code, he could only understand bits and pieces of what the Navajo Code Talkers were saying. Eventually, this led him to tell the Japanese that it sounded like nonsense to him.

As punishment for his inability to crack the code and possibly because the Japanese viewed him as unwilling to crack the code, he was stripped naked and forced to stand for hours in deep snow until he talked. When he was finally allowed to return to his cell, a guard shoved him, causing the soles of his feet to tear as they were frozen to the ground.

After surviving the prison camps, the &quot;hell ships&quot; and the torture, Kieyoomia was a prisoner in Nagasaki when that city was the target of the second atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF). Kieyoomia survived the attack, saying he was protected by the concrete walls of his cell.

After 3½ years as a prisoner of war, he was abandoned in the city for three days after the bombing, but said a Japanese officer finally freed him.

==Later life and death==

After the war, Kieyoomia returned to the United States and he regained the use of his wounded leg, and his feet healed. He lived to age 77, dying in 1997.

<text>Au Go Go Records is a Melbourne, Australia based independent record label.
It was founded by Bruce Milne and Philip Morland from a house in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy in 1979 and was later operated by Greta Moon.

The label started releasing bands on the Melbourne punk and new wave scene. Its first release was in 1979 with the EP &quot;Overnight&quot; by Two Way Garden. The label&#x27;s first 25 releases included debut recordings of some seminal Australian acts such as Crackajacks, Marching Girls, Clint Small, Scapa Flow, Little Murders, the Zorros, Dorian Gray and Plays With Marionettes (later The Wreckery, featuring Hugo Race). Philip Morland left and Greta Moon joined in 1982.

By 1982 the label had started to increase its profile due to the local and overseas success of bands like The Moodists (featuring Dave Graney and Mick Turner later of Dirty Three). Notable releases included the Scientists&#x27; &quot;Swampland&quot; (actually the b-side of the single &quot;This Is My Happy Hour&quot;) and God&#x27;s &quot;My Pal&quot;, one of the label&#x27;s most popular releases, as well as titles by Ollie Olsen&#x27;s band No, Harem Scarem, various compilations such as the &quot;Asleep at the Wheel&quot; collection of (mostly unsigned) Melbourne bands, and the well-received &quot;Hard To Beat&quot;, a double album tribute to the Stooges, featuring many Australian acts. In April 1989, the label released the debut single by the Candy Harlots, entitled &quot;Red Hot Rocket&quot;, with the initial 500 copies pressed on red vinyl and wrapped in a pair of women&#x27;s knickers printed with the band name.

The label also branched out into international releases, issuing albums (under license) by overseas bands such as Sonic Youth, Mudhoney, Dinosaur Jr., Big Black and The 5.6.7.8&#x27;s. Au Go Go was also instrumental in helping these bands tour Australia. in 1989 Bruce Milne started an offshoot label, Giant Claw Records, to issue 7&quot; singles. 

The Au-Go-Go record label continued throughout the 1990s, issuing early releases from such Australian acts as Spiderbait, The Meanies and Magic Dirt, the latter becoming one of the label&#x27;s top attractions. Magic Dirt left Au Go Go in 1999, and the label never fully recovered. 

Many of Au Go Go&#x27;s releases are now out of print and are fast becoming collector&#x27;s items.

== Au Go Go Records shop ==

In 1987, with the success of their mail-order and distribution services, Au Go Go opened a record shop at a retail space in Little Collins St in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD, also taking over the lease of Gaslight&#x27;s suburban Malvern store. Later the business moved to its best-known location of 349 Little Bourke St on the corner of Somerset Place, then in June 2000 to a smaller space in Somerset Place. The retail aspect closed in late 2003 and elements of the business were absorbed into the operations of Shock Records. The Au Go Go website was last updated Tue 3 Feb 2009.

In the 2000s, Bruce Milne was involved in running Melbourne pub/rock venue The Tote Hotel in Collingwood, as well as a new label, In-Fidelity Recordings. He continues to be a sought-after DJ and radio presenter, co-hosting Melbourne Music Bus Tours which is associated with the Arts Centre Melbourne&#x27;s Australian Music Vault.

<doc id="711862" wikidata="Q540664" url="?curid=711862" title="Reissner–Nordström metric">
<text>In physics and astronomy, the Reissner–Nordström metric is a static solution to the Einstein–Maxwell field equations, which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass &quot;M&quot;. The analogous solution for a charged, rotating body is given by the Kerr–Newman metric.

The metric was discovered between 1916 and 1921 by Hans Reissner, Hermann Weyl, Gunnar Nordström and George Barker Jeffery independently.

== Metric ==
In spherical coordinates , the Reissner–Nordström metric (i.e. the line element) is
: formula_1 formula_2 formula_3 formula_4 formula_5 formula_6
where
* formula_7 is the speed of light
* formula_8 is the proper time
* formula_9 is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity).
* formula_10 is the radial coordinate
* formula_11 are the spherical angles
* formula_12 is the Schwarzschild radius of the body given by formula_13
* formula_14 is a characteristic length scale given by formula_15
* formula_16 is the electric constant.

The total mass of the central body and its irreducible mass are related by
: formula_17

The difference between formula_18 and formula_19 is due to the equivalence of mass and energy, which makes the electric field energy also contribute to the total mass.

In the limit that the charge formula_20 (or equivalently, the length scale ) goes to zero, one recovers the Schwarzschild metric. The classical Newtonian theory of gravity may then be recovered in the limit as the ratio formula_21 goes to zero. In the limit that both formula_22 and formula_21 go to zero, the metric becomes the Minkowski metric for special relativity.

In practice, the ratio formula_21 is often extremely small. For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth is roughly (3/8 inch), whereas a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit has an orbital radius formula_10 that is roughly four billion times larger, at (). Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The ratio only becomes large close to black holes and other ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars.

== Charged black holes ==
Although charged black holes with &quot;rQ&quot; ≪ &quot;r&quot;s are similar to the Schwarzschild black hole, they have two horizons: the event horizon and an internal Cauchy horizon. As with the Schwarzschild metric, the event horizons for the spacetime are located where the metric component formula_26 diverges; that is, where
formula_27

This equation has two solutions:
formula_28

These concentric event horizons become degenerate for 2&quot;rQ&quot; = &quot;r&quot;s, which corresponds to an extremal black hole. Black holes with 2&quot;rQ&quot; &gt; &quot;r&quot;s cannot exist in nature because if the charge is greater than the mass there can be no physical event horizon (the term under the square root becomes negative). Objects with a charge greater than their mass can exist in nature, but they can not collapse down to a black hole, and if they could, they would display a naked singularity. Theories with supersymmetry usually guarantee that such &quot;superextremal&quot; black holes cannot exist.

The electromagnetic potential is
formula_29

If magnetic monopoles are included in the theory, then a generalization to include magnetic charge &quot;P&quot; is obtained by replacing &quot;Q&quot;2 by &quot;Q&quot;2 + &quot;P&quot;2 in the metric and including the term &quot;P&quot; cos &quot;θ&quot; &quot;dφ&quot; in the electromagnetic potential.

== Gravitational time dilation ==

The gravitational time dilation in the vicinity of the central body is given by
formula_30
which relates to the local radial escape velocity of a neutral particle
formula_31

== Christoffel symbols ==

The Christoffel symbols
formula_32
with the indices
formula_33
give the nonvanishing expressions
formula_34

Given the Christoffel symbols, one can compute the geodesics of a test-particle.

== Tetrad form ==
Instead of working in the holonomic basis, one can perform efficient calculations with a tetrad. Let formula_35 be a set of one-forms with internal Minkowski index , such that . The Reissner metric can be described by the tetrad
: formula_36
: formula_37
: formula_38
: formula_39
where . The parallel transport of the tetrad is captured by the connection one-forms . These have only 24 independent components compared to the 40 components of . The connections can be solved for by inspection from Cartan&#x27;s equation , where the left hand side is the exterior derivative of the tetrad, and the right hand side is a wedge product.
: formula_40
: formula_41
: formula_42
: formula_43
: formula_44

The Riemann tensor formula_45 can be constructed as a collection of two-forms by the second Cartan equation formula_46 which again makes use of the exterior derivative and wedge product. This approach is significantly faster than the traditional computation with ; note that there are only four nonzero formula_47 compared with nine nonzero components of .

== Equations of motion ==
Because of the spherical symmetry of the metric, the coordinate system can always be aligned in a way that the motion of a test-particle is confined to a plane, so for brevity and without restriction of generality we use &quot;θ&quot; instead of &quot;φ&quot;. In dimensionless natural units of &quot;G&quot; = &quot;M&quot; = &quot;c&quot; = &quot;K&quot; = 1 the motion of an electrically charged particle with the charge &quot;q&quot; is given by
formula_48
which yields
formula_49
formula_50
formula_51

All total derivatives are with respect to proper time .

Constants of the motion are provided by solutions formula_52 to the partial differential equation
formula_53
after substitution of the second derivatives given above. The metric itself is a solution when written as a differential equation
formula_54

The separable equation
formula_55
immediately yields the constant relativistic specific angular momentum
formula_56
a third constant obtained from
formula_57
is the specific energy (energy per unit rest mass)
formula_58

Substituting formula_59 and formula_60 into formula_61 yields the radial equation 
formula_62

Multiplying under the integral sign by formula_59 yields the orbital equation
formula_64

The total time dilation between the test-particle and an observer at infinity is
formula_65

The first derivatives formula_66 and the contravariant components of the local 3-velocity formula_67 are related by
formula_68
which gives the initial conditions
formula_69
formula_70

The specific orbital energy
formula_71
and the specific relative angular momentum
formula_72
of the test-particle are conserved quantities of motion. formula_73 and formula_74 are the radial and transverse components of the local velocity-vector. The local velocity is therefore
formula_75

== Alternative formulation of metric ==
The metric can be expressed in Kerr–Schild form like this:
formula_76

Notice that k is a unit vector. Here &quot;M&quot; is the constant mass of the object, &quot;Q&quot; is the constant charge of the object, and &quot;η&quot; is the Minkowski tensor.

<text>Kvik Halden FK is a Norwegian football club, founded on 19 June 1906.

The club plays in the 2. divisjon after their promotion from the 2018 3. divisjon. In 2010 they contested a playoff to win promotion, and succeeded by beating Eik-Tønsberg 5–1 on aggregate.

In 1997, a merger between the two Halden-based clubs FK Kvik and Halden FK resulted in the formation of Kvik Halden FK. Long before the merger, FK Kvik was informally known as Kvik Halden anyway, to avoid confusion with the other FK Kvik from Trondheim. FK Kvik was the older and better of the two, but Halden FK had a rather large base of young players. The merger was controversial, and has been criticized by some who claim that the result of the merger was that FK Kvik simply took over Halden FK.

Kvik Halden&#x27;s only major trophy came in 1918, when the club (then FK Kvik) won the Norwegian Cup, defeating Brann in the final. FK Kvik also played two other Cup Finals, in 1915 and 1922, but lost both, each time to Odd.

The 1910s and 20s was Kvik&#x27;s glory days. In this period, the club had several players on the national team, and was one of the top clubs in Norwegian football. However, since the end of World War II, the team has never played in the highest football division, making Halden the second-largest town in Norway (behind Arendal) that has never had a top-division football team since a national league competition was established in 1948.

<text>Sir John Edward Sulston (27 March 1942 – 6 March 2018) was a British biologist and academic who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the cell lineage and genome of the worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; in 2002 with his colleagues Sydney Brenner and Robert Horvitz at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. He was a leader in human genome research and Chair of the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester.
Sulston was in favour of science in the public interest, such as free public access of scientific information and against the patenting of genes and the privatisation of genetic technologies.

==Early life and education==
Sulston was born in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, England to Arthur Edward Aubrey Sulston and Josephine Muriel Frearson, née Blocksidge. His father was an Anglican priest and administrator of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. His mother quit her job as an English teacher at Watford Grammar School, to care for him and his sister Madeleine. and home-tutored them until he was five. At age five he entered the local preparatory school, York House School, where he soon developed an aversion to games. He developed an early interest in science, having fun with dissecting animals and sectioning plants to observe their structure and function. Sulston won a scholarship to Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood and then to Pembroke College, Cambridge graduating in 1963 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences (Chemistry). He joined the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, after being interviewed by Alexander Todd and was awarded his PhD in 1966 for research in nucleotide chemistry.

==Career==
Between 1966 and 1969 he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. His academic advisor Colin Reese had arranged for him to work with Leslie Orgel, who would turn his scientific career onto a different pathway. Orgel introduced him to Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner, who worked in Cambridge. He became inclined to biological research.

Although Orgel wanted Sulston to remain with him, Sydney Brenner persuaded Sulston to return to Cambridge to work on the neurobiology of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB). Sulston soon produced the complete map of the worm&#x27;s neurons. He continued work on its DNA and subsequently the whole genome sequencing. In 1998, the whole genome sequence was published in collaboration with the Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis,
 so that &quot;C. elegans&quot; became the first animal to have its complete genome sequenced.

Sulston played a central role in both the &quot;C. elegans&quot; and human genome sequencing projects. He had argued successfully for the sequencing of &quot;C. elegans&quot; to show that large-scale genome sequencing projects were feasible. As sequencing of the worm genome proceeded, the Human Genome Project began. At this point he was made director of the newly established Sanger Centre (named after Fred Sanger), located in Cambridgeshire, England.

In 2000, after the &#x27;working draft&#x27; of the human genome sequence was completed, Sulston retired from directing the Sanger Centre. With Georgina Ferry, he narrated his research career leading to the human genome sequence in &quot;The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics, and the Human Genome&quot; (2002).

===Awards and honours===
Sulston was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1986. His certificate of election reads: He was elected an EMBO Member in 1989 and awarded the George W. Beadle Award in 2000. In 2001 Sulston gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on &quot;The Secrets of Life&quot;. In 2002, he won the Dan David Prize and the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award. Later, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sydney Brenner and Robert Horvitz, both of whom he had collaborated with at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), for their discoveries concerning &#x27;genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death&#x27;. 
One of Sulston&#x27;s most important contributions during his research years at the LMB was to elucidate the precise order in which cells in &quot;C. elegans&quot; divide. In fact, he and his team succeeded in tracing the nematode&#x27;s entire embryonic cell lineage.

In 2004, Sulston received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2006, he was awarded the George Dawson Prize in Genetics by Trinity College Dublin. In 2013, Sulston was awarded the Royal Society of New Zealand&#x27;s Rutherford Memorial Lecture, which he gave on the subject of population pressure.

He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to science and society.

On 23 October 2017 he was awarded the Cambridge Chemistry Alumni Medal.

Sulston was a leading campaigner against the patenting of human genetic information.

==Personal life==

John Sulston met Daphne Bate, a research assistant in Cambridge. They got married in 1966 just before they left for US for postdoctoral research. Together they had two children. Their first child, Ingrid, was born in La Jolla in 1967, and their second, Adrian, later in England. The couple lived in Stapleford, Cambridgeshire where they were active members of the local community: John regularly volunteered in the local library and in working parties at Magog Down; he was a Trustee of Cambridge Past, Present and Future.

Although brought up in a Christian family, Sulston lost his faith during his student life at Cambridge, and remained an atheist. He was a distinguished supporter of Humanists UK. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

Sulston was in favour of free public access of scientific information. He wanted genome information freely available, and he described as &quot;totally immoral and disgusting&quot; the idea of profiteering from such research. He also wanted to change patent law, and argued that restrictions on drugs such as the anti-viral drug Tamiflu by Roche are a hindrance to patients whose lives are dependent on them.

In December 2010, Sulston backed Julian Assange by acting as a bail surety for him, according to Assange&#x27;s attorney Mark Stephens. Sulston forfeited £15,000 of the £20,000 pledged in June 2012, as Assange had entered the embassy of Ecuador to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts.

Sulston died on 6 March 2018 of stomach cancer, aged 75 years.

<doc id="711870" wikidata="Q370226" url="?curid=711870" title="Nathan Rosen">
<text>Nathan Rosen (; March 22, 1909 – December 18, 1995) was an American and Israeli physicist noted for his study on the structure of the hydrogen molecule and his collaboration with Albert Einstein and Boris Podolsky on entangled wave functions and the EPR paradox. He is also remembered for the Einstein–Rosen bridge, the first known kind of wormhole.

==Background==
Nathan Rosen was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He attended MIT during the Great Depression, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electromechanical engineering and later a master&#x27;s and a doctorate in physics. As a student he published several papers of note, one being &quot;The Neutron,&quot; which attempted to explain the structure of the atomic nucleus a year before their discovery by James Chadwick. He also developed an interest in wave functions, and later, gravitation, when he worked as a fellow at the University of Michigan and Princeton University.

==State of science==
At the beginning of the 20th century science was progressing quickly and the inner workings of the atom were just beginning to be discovered. In 1900, Max Planck proposed the quantum theory, the idea that all energy moves in discrete amounts called quanta. In 1905, Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativity, which would be instrumental in the progression of physics and the understanding of the universe. Around 1927, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, collaborating with many other physicists, developed the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, determining the probabilities of the movement of particles. These breakthroughs provided the model for the structure and workings of the atom and drove the revolution that would sweep up Nathan Rosen.

==Work with Einstein==
In 1932 with a ScD degree from MIT, he went to do research at Princeton University. In 1934 he became Albert Einstein&#x27;s assistant at The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and continued in that position until 1936. In July 1935 Einstein and Rosen published an article developing a concept of folded space time in parallel layers connected by a bridge, using only General Relativity and Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Earlier while working with Einstein, Rosen had pointed out the peculiarities of Einstein&#x27;s studies involving entangled wave functions, and, in coordination with Boris Podolsky, a paper was drafted and published in May 1935 helping to develop a theoretical basis for the July 1935 publication. The May 1935 paper, entitled &quot;Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?&quot; labeled these effects the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox or EPR paradox. Einstein helped Rosen to continue his career in physics with a letter to Molotov in the Soviet Union resulting in a temporary position during which in 1937 Einstein and Rosen published an article &quot;On Gravitational Waves&quot; in which they further developed the concept of folded space time caused by rotating cylinders.

After leaving Princeton, Rosen continued to publish on relativity with &quot;General Relativity and Flat Space&quot; in 1940 and &quot;Energy and momentum of cylindrical gravitational waves&quot; in 1958, further developing work on theoretical structures of space-time. This concept, known today as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, was shown in a 1962 paper by theoretical physicists John A. Wheeler and Robert W. Fuller to be unstable. Other researchers further developed this work; &quot;Robert Hjellming in 1971 presented a model in which a black hole would draw matter in while being connected to a white hole in a distant location, which expels this same matter.&quot; &quot;In a 1988 paper, physicists Kip Thorne and Mike Morris proposed that such a wormhole could be made stable by containing some form of negative matter or energy.&quot; This later work is not attributable to Rosen.

Between 1940 and 1989 Rosen published a series of articles on his versions of bimetric gravity, an attempt to improve on General Relativity by removing singularities and replacing pseudo-tensors with tensors to eliminate nonlocality. The effort eventually failed in 1992 with conflicting pulsar data.

==Later years==
Later in his life, Nathan Rosen turned his attentions to teaching and the establishment of new universities. After briefly working for two years in the Soviet Union at the University of Kiev starting in 1936, he returned to the United States, where he taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1941 to 1952. In 1953, after permanently moving to Israel, he joined the Technion in Haifa, Israel. During this time Rosen was advisor to Asher Peres. Technion now has a lecture series named for him. He was President of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in the 1970s and commuted between the two institutions from his home in Haifa. Additionally, Nathan Rosen helped found the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Physical Society of Israel (serving as president from 1955 to 1957), and the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation (president 1974-77). He was very active in encouraging the founding of higher educational institutions in Israel.

He died on December 18, 1995, at his home in Haifa at the age of 86.

==Contributions to physics==
Rosen made a number of contributions to modern physics. One of the most lasting discoveries Rosen brought to physics was his formulation of the structure of the hydrogen molecule, a molecule where none of the electrons have a definite quantum number, but the pair of electrons has a pure state. Rosen used what he called &quot;entangled&quot; wave functions to represent the molecule&#x27;s structure.

He also developed a theoretical analysis of the neutron as a combination of proton and electron in a 1931 article in &quot;Physical Review&quot;.

<text>Pierre Morad Omidyar (born Parviz Morad Omidyar, June 21, 1967) is a French-born Iranian-American billionaire. A technology entrepreneur, software engineer, and philanthropist, he is the founder of eBay, where he served as chairman from 1998 to 2015. Omidyar and his wife Pamela founded Omidyar Network in 2004. , &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Omidyar as the 245th-richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $8.7 billion.

Omidyar is a long-term Democratic Party donor. Since 2010, he has been involved in online journalism as the head of investigative reporting and public affairs news service &quot;Honolulu Civil Beat&quot;. In 2013, he announced that he would create and finance First Look Media, a journalism venture to include Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Jeremy Scahill.

==Early life and education==
Parviz Morad Omidyar was born on June 21, 1967, in Paris, the son of Iranian parents who had immigrated to France for higher education. He was named Parviz. His mother, Elahé Mir-Djalali Omidyar, who earned her doctorate in linguistics at the Sorbonne, is an academic. His father, Cyrus Omidyar (born ), completed medical education and training in France and is a surgeon.

The family immigrated to the United States when Omidyar was a child; his father worked as a urologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He now practices in Aliso Viejo, California.

Omidyar attended Punahou School in Honolulu for two years. (He now serves on its board of trustees). His interest in computers began while he was a ninth-grade student at The Potomac School in McLean, Virginia. He graduated in 1984 from St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal School, Potomac, Maryland.

He started his undergraduate studies at Tufts University, and finished it at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating with a B.S. in computer science in 1988.

==Career==
Shortly after studying at Berkeley, Omidyar started working for Claris, an Apple Computer subsidiary. He worked with the team that upgraded MacDraw to MacDraw II. In 1991, he co-founded Ink Development, a pen-based computing startup that later was rebranded as an e-commerce company and renamed eShop Inc.

Microsoft acquired eShop on June 11, 1996, for less than $50 million, and Omidyar earned $1 million from the deal.

=== Founding eBay===

In 1995, at 28, Omidyar began to write the original computer code for an online venue to enable the listing of a direct person-to-person auction for collectible items. He created a simple prototype on his web page. On Labor Day, Monday, September 4, 1995, he launched an online service called Auction Web, which would eventually be developed as the auction site eBay.
The service was originally one of several items on Omidyar&#x27;s website eBay.com. His website also had a section devoted to the Ebola virus, among other topics.

The first item sold on the eBay site was a broken laser pointer. Omidyar was astonished that anyone would pay for a broken device, but the buyer assured him that he was deliberately collecting broken laser pointers. Similar surprises followed. The business exploded as correspondents began registering a wide variety of trade goods.

Omidyar incorporated the enterprise; his small fee on each sale financed the site&#x27;s expansion. The revenue soon outstripped his salary at General Magic and nine months later, Omidyar decided to dedicate his full attention to his new enterprise.

By 1996, when Omidyar signed a licensing deal to offer airline tickets online, the site had hosted 250,000 auctions. In the first month of 1997, it hosted two million. By the middle of that year, eBay hosted nearly 800,000 auctions daily.

In 1997, Omidyar changed the company&#x27;s name from AuctionWeb to eBay and began advertising the service aggressively. The name &quot;eBay&quot; was his second choice. His first choice was registered to a Canadian mining company, Echo Bay Mines. He originally wanted Echo Bay, the name of a recreational area near Lake Mead, Nevada, because it &quot;sounded cool&quot;. When he learned that echobay.com was taken, he dropped the &quot;cho&quot;, and ebay.com was born. The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar&#x27;s fiancée trade Pez candy dispensers was fabricated by a public relations manager in 1997 to interest the media. This was revealed in Adam Cohen&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;The Perfect Store&quot;, and confirmed by eBay.

==Later years==
Jeffrey Skoll joined the company in 1996. In March 1998, Meg Whitman was elected president and CEO. She ran the company until January 2008, when she announced her retirement. In September 1998, eBay launched a successful public offering, making both Omidyar and Skoll billionaires.

In 2002, eBay bought PayPal, an online payment company. Later, in 2015, they spun PayPal off. Omidyar still owns 6% of its worth.

, Omidyar&#x27;s 178 million eBay shares were worth around $4.45 billion. Omidyar is an investor in Montage Resort and Spa in Laguna Beach, California.

Omidyar is also a member of the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s 21st Century Council.

In 2020, Omidyar stepped down from the board of eBay as part of a broader overhaul of the company. He has, however, stayed active in the company, retaining the title of director emeritus.

==News media businesses==
In 2010, Omidyar launched an online investigative reporting news service, &quot;Honolulu Civil Beat&quot;, covering civic affairs in Hawaii. The site was named Best News Website in Hawaii for 2010, 2011, and 2012. On September 4, 2013, &quot;Honolulu Civil Beat&quot; started a partnership with &quot;HuffPost&quot;, launching &quot;HuffPost Hawaii&quot;.

In 2013, prompted by the Edward Snowden leaks, Omidyar announced the creation of the journalism venture First Look Media, which on February 10, 2014, launched &quot;The Intercept&quot;, drawing from journalists such as Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Jeremy Scahill, Dan Froomkin, John Temple, and Jay Rosen.

==Film production==
Omidyar has been part of the executive producer team for the following films.
*&quot;Merchants of Doubt&quot; (2014)
*&quot;Spotlight&quot; (2015)

== Antitrust Activism and criticism of big tech ==

He has bankrolled groups like the anti-monopoly think tank Open Markets Institute and the digital rights group Public Knowledge Project, in the fight against the big tech companies, which he criticizes as overly powerful and destructive to democracy.
His advocacy and philanthropic investment firm the Omidyar Network, distributed widely read papers laying out the antitrust cases against Facebook and Google. In February 2021, his network hosted a series on whistleblowing, and is now providing financial support to Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.

<doc id="711881" wikidata="Q6016767" url="?curid=711881" title="Independent Local Radio">
<text>Independent Local Radio is the collective name given to commercial radio stations in the United Kingdom. 

As a result of the buyouts and mergers permitted by the Broadcasting Act 1990, and deregulation resulting from the Communications Act 2003, most commercial stations are now neither independent (although they remain independent from the BBC) nor local, as almost all of them are now relays of a national brand, with all remaining locality reduced to nothing more than a weekday regional programme and localised commercials, news, weather and peak-time travel information.

The same name is used for Independent Local Radio in Ireland.

==History==
===Development of ILR===
Until the early 1970s, the BBC had a legal monopoly on radio broadcasting in the UK. Despite competition from the commercial Radio Luxembourg and, for a period in the mid-1960s, the off-shore &quot;pirate&quot; broadcasters, it had remained the policy of both major political parties that radio was to remain under the BBC.

This policy changed after the election of Edward Heath&#x27;s government in 1970. It is possible that Heath&#x27;s victory was partly due to younger voters upset by Harold Wilson&#x27;s government closing down the popular pirate radio stations.

The new Minister of Post and Telecommunications and former ITN newscaster, Christopher Chataway, announced a bill to allow for the introduction of commercial radio in the United Kingdom. This service would be planned and regulated similarly to the existing ITV service and would compete with the recently developed BBC Local Radio services (rather than the four national BBC services).

The Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 received royal assent on 12 July 1972 and the Independent Television Authority (ITA) accordingly changed its name to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) that same day.

The IBA immediately began to plan the new service, placing advertisements encouraging interested groups to apply for medium-term contracts to provide programmes in given areas. The first major areas to be advertised were London and Glasgow, with two contracts available in London, one for &quot;news and information&quot;, one for &quot;general and entertainment&quot;. Contracts were for three years, extendable for one year each year; thus, they were indefinite if the IBA was satisfied with the contractor&#x27;s performance.

The London news contract was awarded to London Broadcasting Company (LBC) and they began broadcasting on 8 October 1973. The London general contract went to Capital Radio, who began broadcasting on 16 October 1973. In total, 19 contracts were awarded between 1973 and 1976. Due to government limits on capital expenditure and turbulence in the broadcasting field (mainly due to the Annan Report), no further contracts were awarded until 1980, when a second tranche of contracts were awarded. All stations were awarded an AM and an FM frequency, on which they broadcast the same service.

===Original contracts===

====First tranche====
====Second tranche====


In July 1981, the Home Secretary approved proposals for the creation of Independent Local Radio services in 25 more areas. However some of these areas were not licensed during the IBA&#x27;s time as the regulator and did not receive a commercial station until after its successor, The Radio Authority, came into being in 1991.
===Extension of ILR===
In the late 1980s, the expansion of ILR continued at a similar rate. Under the Broadcasting Acts, the IBA had a duty to ensure that any area it licensed for radio could support a station with the available advertising revenue. Therefore, many areas were not included in the IBA&#x27;s ILR plans as it was felt that they were not viable. This did not prevent Radio West in Bristol getting into financial trouble and having to merge with Wiltshire Radio on 1 October 1985; nor did it prevent Centre Radio going into receivership on 6 October 1983.

===Split services===
In 1986 the Home Office sanctioned in principle the idea that different services could be broadcast on each station&#x27;s FM and AM frequency and six experiments of split programming on Independent Local Radio of up to ten hours a week took place, although the first experimental part-time split service had taken place two years earlier when Radio Forth created Festival City Radio for the duration of the Edinburgh Festival. The first station to permanently split their frequencies was Guildford&#x27;s County Sound who rebranded the FM output as Premier Radio and turned the AM output into a new golden oldies station, County Sound Gold in 1988.

By 1988, the government had decided that the practice of splitting was beneficial and a quick way to increase choice for listeners. The IBA then began encouraging ILR stations to split their services and most soon complied. The usual format was to have a &quot;gold&quot; (oldies) service on AM and pop music on FM, although Radio City tried &quot;City Talk&quot; on AM before abandoning the format. By the start of the 1990s, most stations had done &#x27;the splits&#x27; with the final stations ending waveband simulcasting by the mid-1990s.

=== Incremental Radio ===
Incremental Radio was a new type of radio licence given out by the IBA between 1989 and 1990. These were additional radio services introduced into areas already served by an Independent Local Radio station and most had to offer output not already available on ILR, such as specialist music, programmes for a specific section of the community or for smaller areas than ILR stations cover. 22 stations went on air, most of which were eventually acquired by the large radio groups and absorbed into their networks. As of 2024 only a few remain independently owned and operated. The regulatory model these stations were under was a precursor to commercial radio stations licensed by the incoming Radio Authority.

==The Broadcasting Act 1990==
The Broadcasting Act 1990 provided for the abolition of the IBA and its replacement by the Independent Television Commission. The IBA continued to regulate radio under the new name of the Radio Authority, but with a different remit.

As a &quot;light-touch&quot; regulator (although heavier than the ITC), the Radio Authority was to issue licences to the highest bidder and promote the development of commercial radio choice.

===INR, RSLs, SALLIES and IRR===
This led to the awarding of three national contracts, known as Independent National Radio to Classic FM, Virgin 1215 (later Virgin Radio and then rebranded Absolute Radio) and Talk Radio (later Talksport).

The Radio Authority also began to license Restricted Service Licence (RSL) stations – low-power temporary radio stations for special events, operating for up to 28 days a year – and to reduce the criteria for a &quot;viable service area&quot; with the introduction of Small Scale Local Licences (SALLIES) for villages, special interest groups and small communities.

By this time the medium wave band had become unpopular with radio groups and the majority of new stations were awarded an FM licence only, even when an AM licence was jointly available.

In 1994 the Radio Authority introduced regional stations (Independent Regional Radio, again usually grouped under the banner &quot;ILR&quot; by most commentators) and began to license the commercial Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) multiplexes in October 1998.

The Radio Authority was replaced by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in 2004, which also replaced the ITC, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the Radio Communications Agency and the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel). Ofcom has stated that they plan to continue the development of Independent Local Radio, with an emphasis on digital broadcasting, and to &quot;ensure the character&quot; of local stations, following the mergers and loss of local identities that followed the 1990 Act.

==ILR stations==
In 2005, there were 217 licensed analogue ILR and IRR services in England; 16 in Wales; 34 in Scotland; eight in Northern Ireland; and two in the Channel Islands. These are &quot;licences&quot; rather than &quot;franchises&quot;. Some licences are grouped nationally, regionally or by format to provide one service; other licences cover two or more services.

There were three national analogue services. There was one national DAB multiplex (Digital One) and 47 regional DAB multiplexes, owned by 10 and operated by nine companies (each multiplex carrying multiple services).

===Manx Radio===
The first licensed commercial radio station in the United Kingdom is often stated to be Manx Radio, which launched in June 1964. However, since the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom, Manx Radio is not considered to be an ILR station and launched with a Post Office licence. Manx Radio is funded by a mixture of commercial advertising and a yearly £860,000 Manx Government subvention.

<text>Paul R. Leonard (born July 3, 1943) is an American politician who is a member of the Ohio Democratic Party. He served as the mayor of Dayton from 1982 to 1986 and as the 58th lieutenant governor of Ohio from 1987 to 1991.

==Education==
Leonard graduated from Ohio University with a B.A. in journalism in 1965 and received his J.D. from Northern Kentucky University in 1969.

==Political career==

Leonard was elected four times to seats in the Ohio General Assembly. After his time in the Ohio General Assembly he then served as mayor of Dayton, Ohio, from 1982 to 1986. After finishing his term as mayor he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Ohio in 1986 on the ticket with Richard F. Celeste. He served as the lieutenant governor from 1987 to 1991.

While mayor of Dayton, Leonard was known as outgoing and youth-oriented, sometimes called &quot;the Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Mayor of Dayton.&quot; He played the electric guitar and appeared in television commercials.

After his tenure as lieutenant governor, Leonard returned to Dayton to practice law. He founded the Center for Animal Law and Advocacy, a legal team that advocates for harsher penalties for those who mistreat animals.

In addition to his law practice, Leonard currently teaches in the political science departments at both Wright State University and the University of Dayton. He is also on the Board of Directors for the Animal Legal Defense Fund. He currently lives in Florida, but commutes to Dayton to teach his classes.

<doc id="711886" wikidata="Q2470767" url="?curid=711886" title="Cauchy horizon">
<text>In physics, a Cauchy horizon is a light-like boundary of the domain of validity of a Cauchy problem (a particular boundary value problem of the theory of partial differential equations). One side of the horizon contains closed space-like geodesics and the other side contains closed time-like geodesics. The concept is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy.

Under the averaged weak energy condition (AWEC), Cauchy horizons are inherently unstable. However, cases of AWEC violation, such as the Casimir effect caused by periodic boundary conditions, do exist, and since the region of spacetime inside the Cauchy horizon has closed timelike curves it is subject to periodic boundary conditions. If the spacetime inside the Cauchy horizon violates AWEC, then the horizon becomes stable and frequency boosting effects would be canceled out by the tendency of the spacetime to act as a divergent lens. Were this conjecture to be shown empirically true, it would provide a counter-example to the strong cosmic censorship conjecture.

In 2018, it was shown that the spacetime behind the Cauchy horizon of a charged, rotating black hole exists, but is not smooth, so the strong cosmic censorship conjecture is false.

The simplest example is the internal horizon of a Reissner–Nordström black hole.

== In popular media ==
In the 2020 film &quot;Palm Springs&quot;, the character Sarah mentions the Cauchy horizon as she formulates a plan to escape a time loop.

In the pilot episode of 2021 Amazon original series &quot;Solos&quot;, the character Leah solves time travel with &quot;the Cauchy horizon&quot;, which is central to the episode.

<text>Proper length or rest length is the length of an object in the object&#x27;s rest frame.

The measurement of lengths is more complicated in the theory of relativity than in classical mechanics. In classical mechanics, lengths are measured based on the assumption that the locations of all points involved are measured simultaneously. But in the theory of relativity, the notion of simultaneity is dependent on the observer. 

A different term, proper distance, provides an invariant measure whose value is the same for all observers.

&quot;Proper distance&quot; is analogous to proper time. The difference is that the proper distance is defined between two spacelike-separated events (or along a spacelike path), while the proper time is defined between two timelike-separated events (or along a timelike path).

The &quot;proper length&quot; or &quot;rest length&quot; of an object is the length of the object measured by an observer which is at rest relative to it, by applying standard measuring rods on the object. The measurement of the object&#x27;s endpoints doesn&#x27;t have to be simultaneous, since the endpoints are constantly at rest at the same positions in the object&#x27;s rest frame, so it is independent of Δ&quot;t&quot;. This length is thus given by:

:formula_1

However, in relatively moving frames the object&#x27;s endpoints have to be measured simultaneously, since they are constantly changing their position. The resulting length is shorter than the rest length, and is given by the formula for length contraction (with &quot;γ&quot; being the Lorentz factor):

:formula_2
In comparison, the invariant proper distance between two arbitrary events happening at the endpoints of the same object is given by:

:formula_3

So Δ&quot;σ&quot; depends on Δ&quot;t&quot;, whereas (as explained above) the object&#x27;s rest length &quot;L&quot;0 can be measured independently of Δ&quot;t&quot;. It follows that Δ&quot;σ&quot; and &quot;L&quot;0, measured at the endpoints of the same object, only agree with each other when the measurement events were simultaneous in the object&#x27;s rest frame so that Δ&quot;t&quot; is zero. As explained by Fayngold:

:p. 407: &quot;Note that the &quot;proper distance&quot; between two events is generally &quot;not&quot; the same as the &quot;proper length&quot; of an object whose end points happen to be respectively coincident with these events. Consider a solid rod of constant proper length &quot;l&quot;0. If you are in the rest frame &quot;K&quot;0 of the rod, and you want to measure its length, you can do it by first marking its endpoints. And it is not necessary that you mark them simultaneously in &quot;K&quot;0. You can mark one end now (at a moment &quot;t&quot;1) and the other end later (at a moment &quot;t&quot;2) in &quot;K&quot;0, and then quietly measure the distance between the marks. We can even consider such measurement as a possible operational definition of proper length. From the viewpoint of the experimental physics, the requirement that the marks be made simultaneously is redundant for a stationary object with constant shape and size, and can in this case be dropped from such definition. Since the rod is stationary in &quot;K&quot;0, the distance between the marks is the &quot;proper length&quot; of the rod regardless of the time lapse between the two markings. On the other hand, it is not the &quot;proper distance&quot; between the marking events if the marks are not made simultaneously in &quot;K&quot;0.&quot;

== Proper distance between two events in flat space ==

In special relativity, the proper distance between two spacelike-separated events is the distance between the two events, as measured in an inertial frame of reference in which the events are simultaneous. In such a specific frame, the distance is given by

formula_4

where 
* Δ&quot;x&quot;, Δ&quot;y&quot;, and Δ&quot;z&quot; are differences in the linear, orthogonal, spatial coordinates of the two events.

The definition can be given equivalently with respect to any inertial frame of reference (without requiring the events to be simultaneous in that frame) by

formula_5

where 
* Δ&quot;t&quot; is the difference in the temporal coordinates of the two events, and
* &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.

The two formulae are equivalent because of the invariance of spacetime intervals, and since Δ&quot;t&quot; = 0 exactly when the events are simultaneous in the given frame.

Two events are spacelike-separated if and only if the above formula gives a real, non-zero value for Δ&quot;σ&quot;.

== Proper distance along a path ==

The above formula for the proper distance between two events assumes that the spacetime in which the two events occur is flat. Hence, the above formula cannot in general be used in general relativity, in which curved spacetimes are considered. It is, however, possible to define the proper distance along a path in any spacetime, curved or flat. In a flat spacetime, the proper distance between two events is the proper distance along a straight path between the two events. In a curved spacetime, there may be more than one straight path (geodesic) between two events, so the proper distance along a straight path between two events would not uniquely define the proper distance between the two events.

Along an arbitrary spacelike path &quot;P&quot;, the proper distance is given in tensor syntax by the line integral

formula_6

where
* &quot;gμν&quot; is the metric tensor for the current spacetime and coordinate mapping, and
* &quot;dxμ&quot; is the coordinate separation between neighboring events along the path &quot;P&quot;.

In the equation above, the metric tensor is assumed to use the codice_1 metric signature, and is assumed to be normalized to return a time instead of a distance. The − sign in the equation should be dropped with a metric tensor that instead uses the codice_2 metric signature. Also, the formula_7 should be dropped with a metric tensor that is normalized to use a distance, or that uses geometrized units.

<text>Julie Marie Vinter Hansen (20 July 1890 – 27 July 1960) was a Danish astronomer. She is the first woman to be obtain a scientific degree in astronomy in Denmark.

==Life==

===Early life ===
Vinter Hansen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark.

===Education===

While studying at the University of Copenhagen, she was appointed as acomputer at the University&#x27;s observatory in 1915. She was the first woman to hold an appointment at the University. She was later appointed observatory assistant and, in 1922, observer.

==Career==

=== Editor of Nordic Astronomy Review ===

She was a very energetic worker, who, along with her normal work of observing and performing mathematical reductions of observations took on the task of editing the &quot;Nordisk Astronomisk Tidsskrift&quot; (Nordic Astronomy Review).

=== International Astronomical Union ===

She later became Director of the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s telegram bureau and Editor of its Circulars.

=== Work as Astronomer at University of Copenhagen ===

By 1939, Vinter Hansen was the First Astronomer at the Observatory of the University of Copenhagen, widely known for her accurate computation of orbits of minor planets and comets.

=== Tagea Brandt Rejselegat Award ===

In that 1939 she received the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (travel award), given to women that have made big contributions on arts or science. With the award money (DKK 10.000 or 160,000 of actual US $) undertook a tour through the United States to Japan and back. On her return trip in 1940, the outbreak of World War II restricted her homeward journey.

=== Work in University of California ===

She was awarded a Martin Kellogg Fellowship at the University of California which allowed her to work for a time in the United States. Also in 1940 she was awarded the Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy.

=== Return to Denmark ===

Vinter Hansen was appointed Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1956 and continued her career at the University of Copenhagen until 1960.

== Death ==

Julie Vinter Hansen died in 1960, from a heart-failure just days before her retirement, in her beloved vacation destination, the Swiss mountain village of Mürren, and was buried in Copenhagen. The minor planet 1544 Vinterhansenia, discovered by Finnish astronomer Liisi Oterma in the 1940s, was named in her honour.

== Awards ==

* Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog (1956)
* Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy (1940)

<doc id="711904" wikidata="Q3921585" url="?curid=711904" title="Anglo-Saxon Attitudes">
<text>Anglo-Saxon Attitudes is a satirical novel by Angus Wilson, published in 1956. It was Wilson&#x27;s most popular book, and many consider it his best work.

==Plot summary==

The novel deals with the significance of two connected events that happened on the same day, long before the opening of the novel. The first was the excavation of an ancient and valuable archaeological idol, a phallic figure unearthed from the tomb of an Anglo-Saxon bishop Eorpwald, known as the &quot;Melpham excavation&quot;. Gerald has long been haunted by a drunken revelation by his friend Gilbert, who was involved with this excavation, that the whole thing was a hoax perpetrated to embarrass Gilbert&#x27;s father. Gilbert told Gerald that he put the idol there. Gerald, while feeling that his friend was telling the truth, pushed the matter to the back of his mind and tried to forget about it. He now feels ashamed that he, a history professor, has never had the courage to try to resolve the matter one way or another.

The second is that Gerald Middleton fell in love with Dollie, Gilbert&#x27;s fiancée, and had an affair with her when his friend went off to fight in World War I. When Gilbert was killed at the front, Dollie refused to marry Gerald. He ended up marrying a Scandinavian woman named Inge but continued his affair with Dollie, who became an alcoholic. Gerald and Inge later separated.

&quot;Anglo-Saxon Attitudes&quot; is full of side-plots and coincidences and contains a host of eccentric characters. Some of these characters are Gerald&#x27;s family. Robin, his eldest son, is a womaniser who cannot decide whether to leave his wife or his mistress. Kay has an unhappy marriage and a deeply embittered view of her father, whom she appears to blame for everything that has gone wrong in her life, including her withered hand (which was actually caused by her mother). Gerald&#x27;s estranged wife, Inge, is a grotesquely deluded woman who cannot bring herself to acknowledge her younger son John&#x27;s homosexuality or her daughter&#x27;s physical disability.

Gerald feels responsible for Dollie&#x27;s plight and for those of his children. He feels that the knowledge of his complicity over the Melpham affair has drained his morale and made him withdrawn and indecisive. The novel begins with him resolving to make good the &#x27;bloody shameful waste&#x27; of his life, by investigating the Melpham affair and making peace with Dollie. He also attempts to develop better relationships with his grown-up children and with Inge.

By the novel&#x27;s end, Gerald achieves a measure of peace with his past. He persuades Dollie to come forward with a letter from Gilbert&#x27;s father&#x27;s colleague, Canon Portway, proving that the Melpham incident was a hoax; then he and Dollie begin a platonic friendship. He gives up on achieving good relations with his family.

== Sources of inspiration ==
The theme of the novel was suggested to Wilson by archaeological disputes, notably the Piltdown Man hoax (1908–1912) and an accusation that the Elgin Marbles had been mishandled by the British Museum, later substantiated. The book alludes to the Sutton Hoo ship-burial discovery of 1939, in a country-house setting near Woodbridge, Suffolk. The Melpham discovery is similarly set among the &#x27;East Folk&#x27; on the east coast of England. Eorpwald (also the name of the Melpham bishop) is in reality the unique Anglo-Saxon name of the successor of Raedwald, who was popularly thought to have been buried in the famous ship. That discovery, essentially a pagan style of burial in which Christian artefacts were included, raised many disputes among academics (as Angus Wilson knew).

== Television adaptation ==
The novel was made into a three-part television mini-series in 1992 by the Thames Television subsidiary Euston Films. The screenplay was written by Andrew Davies and featured Richard Johnson in the role of Gerald Middleton. Tara Fitzgerald played a major supporting role as the young Dollie and there were appearances by a 16-year-old Kate Winslet, and by Daniel Craig as Gilbert. The film won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Serial; Davies and Johnson also won awards from the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain and the Broadcasting Press Guild respectively. The series is available on DVD in both the UK and USA.

==The phrase &quot;Anglo-Saxon attitudes&quot;==

&quot;Anglo-Saxon attitudes&quot; is a phrase originated by Lewis Carroll in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (1871):

:&quot;All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along the road, shading her eyes with one hand. &#x27;I see somebody now!&#x27; she exclaimed at last. &#x27;But he&#x27;s coming very slowly—and what curious attitudes he goes into!&#x27;

:(For the Messenger kept skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread out like fans on each side.)

:&#x27;Not at all,&#x27; said the King. &#x27;He&#x27;s an Anglo-Saxon Messenger—and those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when he&#x27;s happy.&#x27;&quot;

Wilson uses part of this quotation at the front of his novel. Lewis Carroll is referring to a ninth- to eleventh-century style in English drawing, in which the figures are shown in swaying positions with the palms held out in exaggerated positions.

== Other works ==

&quot;Anglo-Saxon Attitudes&quot; has also been used as the title of several subsequent literary works.

John Maddocks&#x27; review of Carleton S. Coon&#x27;s &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; for the first issue of &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; in February 1963, was headed &quot;Anglo-Saxon Attitudes&quot;. &quot;History Today&quot; titled its report of the opening of a new museum at Canterbury in Kent, on the site of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey, &quot;Anglo-Saxon Attitudes&quot;.

&quot;Anglo-Saxon Attitudes&quot; was also the name of an historical conference &quot;in pursuit of the English&quot; to define the evolution of the English &quot;cultural self-image&quot; held at the University of Salford on 9–11 July 1999.

<doc id="711906" wikidata="Q3510559" url="?curid=711906" title="Easy (Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell album)">
<text>Easy is an album recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and released by Motown Records on September 16, 1969 under the Tamla Records label. One song on the album, &quot;Good Lovin&#x27; Ain&#x27;t Easy To Come By&quot;, was a hit single and remains popular to this day. 

==Background==
Terrell had been ill, suffering from complications caused by a brain tumor, since the fall of 1967. Marvin Gaye later claimed that as a result, most of the female vocals on this album were performed by Valerie Simpson, who served as co-songwriter and co-producer for the LP with her boyfriend and future husband Nickolas Ashford.

Simpson is quoted in Ludie Montgomery&#x27;s biography of Terrell, &quot;My Sister Tommie&quot;, as not having subbed Terrell for vocals. Simpson again explicitly denied having done so in the liner notes to &quot;The Complete Motown Singles&quot; series. On the docuseries Unsung about Terrell, Simpson admitted she sang with Gaye during sessions saying, &quot;I sang things with Marvin because Tammi was not available. And, then we would bring Tammi in to go over her parts. Those are Tammi Terrell vocals because we know that we went back in with Tammi and got what we needed.&quot;

Gaye at the time criticized Motown for the album thinking they were taking advantage of Terrell&#x27;s health. Motown assured him proceeds from the album would go to Terrell&#x27;s family for insurance of her health. At the time the album was released, Terrell was on her seventh operation to cure the brain tumor that would eventually kill her after the eighth operation. The album was released on compact disc in 1992, and again in 2001 as part of &quot;The Complete Duets&quot;.

<doc id="711913" wikidata="Q5102117" url="?curid=711913" title="Chislehurst Caves">
<text>Chislehurst Caves are a series of intersecting man-made tunnels and caverns covering some 22 miles (35.4 km) in Chislehurst in the London Borough of Bromley. From the mid-13th to early 19th centuries the &quot;caves&quot; were created from the mining of flint and lime-burning chalk.

Today the caves are a tourist attraction and, although they are called caves, they are entirely man-made and were dug and used as chalk and flint mines. The earliest recorded mention of the mines and lime-burning kilns above dates from a 9th-century Saxon charter and then not again until around 1232AD; they are believed to have been last worked in the 1830s.

During World War I the caves were used as an ammunition storage dump associated with the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In the 1930s the tunnels were used for mushroom cultivation.

== Second World War shelter ==
When the aerial bombardment of London began in September 1940, the caves were used as an air-raid shelter. Soon they became an underground city accommodating up to 15,000 inhabitants (who each paid a penny to enter). The tunnels were fitted with electric lighting, toilets and washing facilities; a chapel was built and also a hospital.

The caves are located close to Chislehurst railway station and many people arrived there to then enter the shelter. Shortly after VE Day the shelter was officially closed. There was one child born in the caves, christened in the cave chapel with the name of Cavena Wakeman, who had the name until she turned 18, when she legally changed her first name to Rose and using Cavena as her middle name.

==Mythology==
In 1903, William Nichols, then Vice President of the British Archaeological Association, produced a theory that the mines were made by the Druids, Romans and Saxons. This theory was used to give names to the three parts of the caves: tour guides point out supposed Druid altars and Roman features. However, this is based on Dr Nichols&#x27; writings and has not been verified.

The earliest documented evidence for a chalk cave is in 1737. (However, the earliest recorded mention of the mines and lime-burning kilns above, dates from a 9th-century Saxon charter and then not again until around 1232, this being that most likely because there was no taxation on them prior to 1232.) An opposing article in the next issue showed the similarity of the workings to coal mines in the Newcastle area, and argued that most of the excavation had been made in the last two centuries and that the evidence for any dene-holes was slight. However, a dene-hole does exist in what is known as the middle section.

The caves were used between 1830 and the 1860s for producing lime. The 25-inch to a mile (approx 1:2,500) Ordnance Survey map of 1862–63 describes the place as a &quot;chalk pit&quot; and marks an &quot;engine house&quot; and two remaining kilns. A further investigation produced, among other evidence, a letter from the son of one of the workers.

==TV and film==
The caves have appeared in several television programmes including episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 1972 titled &quot;The Mutants&quot;. In an episode of &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; presented by Bill Oddie, the caves were presented as one of the wonders of the London area. The caves were also used in the films &quot;Beat Girl&quot;, &quot;The Tribe&quot; and &quot;Inseminoid&quot; and in music videos for metal bands Iron Maiden - (&quot;Can I Play With Madness&quot;) - and &quot;Cradle of Filth&quot;.
They appear in Episode Five of &quot;The Tyrant King&quot; (1968).

The caves featured in two episodes of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;. A 20-year investigation into the haunting of the caves by author James Wilkinson containing the testimonies of many of the guides and owners over a 50-year period was published in 2011 entitled &quot;The Ghosts of Chislehurst Caves&quot;.

James Braxton visited the caves on &quot;Antiques Road Trip&quot;&#x27;s Series 23, episode 6.

==Music venue==
In the 1950s and 1960s, the caves were used as a skiffle and rock music venue.

From the mid 1950s to until the early 1960s, Lonnie Donegan played there along with other early British rockers such as Adam Faith, Marty Wilde and The Rolling Stones. Even American rockers such as Gene Vincent and Eddie Cochran played here during the early 1960s.

David Bowie was known to have performed there four times: June 1962, 17 November 1962, in 1964 and 4 March 1966.

Pink Floyd played there on 8 December 1967.

Jimi Hendrix played there twice: 16 December 1966 and 27 January 1967.

The Yardbirds played there on 1 July 1966.

Eric Burdon and The Animals performed there on 6 October 1967.

The Herd played there on 7 February 1968.

Other artists that have played there were the Shadows, Tommy Steele, Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, Status Quo, Pretty Things. The Troggs and jazz acts including Acker Bilk, Humphrey Lyttelton and Kenny Ball.

On 31 October 1974, a lavish media party was held in the caves by the band Led Zeppelin to celebrate the launch of new UK record company Swan Song Records.

Radio Caroline broadcast performances on a Saturday night with DJs such as Dave Lee Travis, Johnnie Walker, Tony Blackburn and Simon Dee, who would bring down music acts such as Muddy Waters.

One of the last concerts in the Caves was on 9 January 1981 when four Bromley bands (11.53. Five O, Hepatitis Risk &amp; Real Colmans) played there.
The music aspect of the caves completely stopped in 2000 with The Rock &amp; Roll Gypsies being the last band to perform in January 2001.

<doc id="711932" wikidata="Q4262866" url="?curid=711932" title="Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia">
<text>Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an endocrine disorder that is an uncommon and potentially lethal form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It arises from defects in the earliest stages of steroid hormone synthesis: the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria and the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone—the first step in the synthesis of all steroid hormones. Lipoid CAH causes mineralocorticoid deficiency in affected infants and children. Male infants are severely undervirilized causing their external genitalia to look feminine. The adrenals are large and filled with lipid globules derived from cholesterol.

==Presentation==
Problems that emerge in persons with lipoid CAH can be divided into:
# mineralocorticoid deficiency,
# glucocorticoid deficiency,
# sex steroid deficiency, and
# damage to gonads caused by lipid accumulation.

===Mineralocorticoid deficiency===
Most infants born with lipoid CAH have had genitalia female enough that no disease was suspected at birth. Because the adrenal zona glomerulosa is undifferentiated and inactive before delivery, it is undamaged at birth and can make aldosterone for a while, so the eventual salt-wasting crisis develops more gradually and variably than with severe 21-hydroxylase-deficient CAH.

Most come to medical attention between 2 weeks and 3 months of age, when after a period of poor weight gain and vomiting, they were found to be dehydrated, with severe hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis (&quot;Addisonian or adrenal crisis&quot;). Renin but not aldosterone is elevated. Many infants born with this condition died before a method for diagnosis was recognized for proper treatment to begin. In some cases, the condition is more mild with signs and symptoms of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency appearing after months or even years (late onset).

===Glucocorticoid deficiency===
Insufficiency of cortisol synthesis has several consequences. Elevated ACTH is accompanied by and contributes to marked hyperpigmentation even in the newborn period. An inadequate cortisol response to stress undoubtedly hastens the deterioration as dehydration develops, can cause hypoglycemia, and contributes to the high mortality rate in infancy.

===Sex steroid deficiency and gonadal damage===

====In development====
Prenatal production of DHEA by the fetal adrenal glands is impaired, resulting in abnormally low maternal estriol levels by the middle of pregnancy. The effects of impaired progesterone production from placental cells that originate from the affected baby (trophoblasts) in the case of lipoid CAH due to P450scc deficiency are still unclear, but are thought to result in miscarriage when the deficit in the enzyme&#x27;s activity are severe enough. The results of reduced or absent testosterone output by fetal Leydig cells in the male is detailed below.

====Female patients====
Genetic XX females with lipoid CAH are born with normal external and internal pelvic anatomy. They come to medical attention when they develop a salt-wasting adrenal crisis or other signs of progressive adrenal insufficiency.

With glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement, these girls will reach the age of puberty. Because the ovaries are relatively inactive in fetal life and childhood, they sustain little damage from lipid accumulation during childhood. In the case of lipoid CAH due to StAR deficiency, when rising gonadotropin levels initiate puberty, despite the inefficiency of sex steroid synthesis, the ovaries will usually make enough estradiol to produce breast development, and in some cases even menarche, with menses continuing for some years. Ovarian and adrenal androgen production is minimal and produces little pubic or other body hair.

However insufficient estradiol and progesterone are produced to induce maturation of an egg and ovulation. Although prepubertal ovaries are inactive enough that no lipid accumulates to cause damage, once they have begun to produce estrogen, lipid damage begins to accrue and the ability to produce estrogen, as well as ovulate, is slowly degraded. Cysts also form in the ovaries. Women with lipoid CAH have been infertile presumably due to anovulation.

====Male patients====
The genitalia of XY fetuses with lipoid CAH are severely undervirilized due to impairment of steroid hormone synthesis. The fetal testes make AMH, which prevents a uterus and inner vagina from forming, but since the Leydig cells fail to make testosterone during development even in response to hCG, the testes are usually remain in the abdomen or lodge in the inguinal canals (undescended testes) and are nonfunctional. Consequently, XY patients do not undergo puberty and remain infertile.

In addition to the testes remaining inside, formation of the penis, also dependent on testosterone, is compromised. Hence, the external genitalia in most of infants resemble that of normal females (though the vagina is a short, blind pouch), or is slightly ambiguous (more female than male). Nearly all reported XY cases have been assumed to be girls and raised as such.

===Late onset forms of the disease===
Milder, late onset cases of lipoid CAH have been described that arise from less severe mutations that compromise but do not eliminate the ability of StAR to instigate steroid production. In these cases, mineralocorticoid deficiency emerges up to several years after birth. Sex steroid production may be sufficient to allow for normal sexual development as well and even fertility.

These nonclassic forms of the disorder are sometimes diagnosed as familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 3.

==Genetics==
This inherited disease is autosomal recessive. Understanding of the molecular basis for it has been advanced in the last decade by better understanding of adrenal steroidogenesis as well as genetic studies of affected patients. It used to be assumed that lipoid CAH resulted from a defect of the enzyme that converted cholesterol to pregnenolone. The conversion reactions are mediated by a single enzyme, formerly referred to as 20,22-desmolase, but now identified as cytochrome P450scc (cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme). However, few cases of lipoid CAH due to a mutation and defect of P450scc have been identified. Although the disorder is considered autosomal recessive, a single mutation in P450scc can be sufficient to cause the condition. All other cases of lipoid adrenal hyperplasia that have been studied have been found to be due to mutations of the gene for the primary protein that transports cholesterol into the mitochondria, StAR, encoded by a gene on chromosome 8p11.2 in the human.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasias are a family of autosomal recessive diseases resulting from defects in steps of the synthesis of steroid hormones from cholesterol. All forms of CAH involve excessive or defective production of sex steroids and can prevent or impair development of primary or secondary sex characteristics in affected infants, children, and adults. Many also involve excessive or defective production of mineralocorticoids, which can cause hypertension or salt-wasting.

Lipoid CAH is one of the rarer forms of CAH and results from defects in the steps from cholesterol to pregnenolone. This results in the catastrophic loss of most or all steroid hormones in the body. It is caused by mutations in either of two proteins: cytochrome P450scc and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR).

==Pathophysiology==
The deficiency results in impaired synthesis of all three categories of adrenal steroids (cortisol, mineralocorticoids, sex steroids) and high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A low level of steroid synthesis proceeds even without efficient transport, but is rarely enough to prevent the consequences of deficiency. While severe loss of steroid production results in manifestation of the disease within a few weeks of birth, milder forms (late onset) can present years after birth. Unlike in models of the disease in mice, patients with lipoid CAH do not always have enlarged adrenals due to lipid accumulation. This may in part be due to hormone replacement used to keep them alive preventing hyperstimulation of the gland by the pituitary.

ACTH stimulates growth of the adrenal cells and increases LDL receptors to amplify transport of cholesterol into the cells of the adrenal cortex which make adrenal steroids, where it accumulates since little can enter the mitochondria for conversion to steroid. Normally, adrenal steroids then signal their presence to the brain to moderate ACTH levels (feedback inhibition). However, in the absence of this, ACTH levels are elevated and cholesterol uptake by the cortical cells continues unabated. The adrenals become markedly enlarged (hyperplastic) by the accumulated lipid. Lipid accumulation is thought to damage the cells further (&quot;second hit hypothesis&quot;).

Because P450scc and StAR are also essential for sex steroid synthesis in the testis and ovary, the production of testosterone by Leydig cells in the testis and androgens (which leads to estrogen production by granulosa cells) and progesterone by ovarian theca cells and luteal cells, respectively, can also be impaired. Similar to the adrenal gland, cholesterol accumulation damages the Leydig cells of the testes. In the ovary, the damage begins after puberty, the time when the ovary starts making steroid with follicle development. The placenta also makes steroid to help maintain pregnancy. However, since StAR is not required for placental steroid production, pregnancy goes to term. When the mutation in P450scc that causes lipoid CAH is either heterozygous or its presence on both alleles does not completely destroy all function, affected babies can survive to birth as well. Also of note, enlargement of the adrenal gland is not always found in the patient, especially in cases where a mutation in the gene for P450scc is the cause.

The pathophysiology of lipoid CAH differs from other forms of CAH in certain aspects. First, the affected gene in most cases is that for a transport protein (StAR) rather than a steroidogenic enzyme. Second, because the defect compromises all steroid synthesis. Thus, there are no problems due to excessive mineralocorticoids or androgens. Third, lipid accumulation damages the testes and ovaries so that even with appropriate adrenal hormone replacement (and in the absence of other intervention), gonadal function and fertility cannot be preserved.

==Diagnosis==
In terms of diagnosis of this condition, gene sequencing can be done.

==Management==
Management of salt-wasting crises and mineralocorticoid treatment are as for other forms of salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasias: saline and fludrocortisone. Glucocorticoids can be provided at minimal replacement doses because there is no need for suppression of excessive adrenal androgens or mineralocorticoids. As with other forms of adrenal insufficiency, extra glucocorticoid is needed for stress coverage.

===Female patients===
XX females with lipoid CAH may need estrogen replacement at or after puberty. Active intervention has been used to preserve the possibility of fertility and conception in lipoid CAH females. In a case report in 2009, a woman with late onset lipoid CAH due to StAR deficiency underwent hormone replacement therapy in combination with an assisted fertility technique, intracytoplasmic sperm injection. This led to ovulation and with implantation of the in vitro fertilized egg, a successful birth.

===Male patients===
Most XY children are so undervirilized that they are raised as girls. The testes are uniformly nonfunctional and undescended; they are removed when the diagnosis is made due to the risk of cancer development in these tissues.

==Epidemiology==
Lipoid CAH is quite rare in European and North American populations. Most cases occur in Japan and Korea (where the incidence is 1 in 300,000 births) and Palestinian Arabs. Despite autosomal inheritance, there has been an unexplained preponderance of genetic females in reported cases.

<doc id="711935" wikidata="Q723407" url="?curid=711935" title="Salome (opera)">
<text>Salome, Op. 54, is an opera in one act by Richard Strauss. The libretto is Hedwig Lachmann&#x27;s German translation of the 1891 French play &quot;Salomé&quot; by Oscar Wilde, edited by the composer. Strauss dedicated the opera to his friend Sir Edgar Speyer.

The opera is famous (at the time of its premiere, infamous) for its &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;. The final scene is frequently heard as a concert-piece for dramatic sopranos.

==Composition history==
Oscar Wilde originally wrote his &quot;Salomé&quot; in French. Strauss saw the Lachmann version of the play in Max Reinhardt&#x27;s production at the Kleines Theater in Berlin on 15 November 1902, and immediately set to work on an opera. The play&#x27;s formal structure was well-suited to musical adaptation. Wilde himself described &quot;Salomé&quot; as containing &quot;refrains whose recurring &quot;motifs&quot; make it so like a piece of music and bind it together as a ballad&quot;. Strauss pared down Lachmann&#x27;s German text to what he saw as its essentials, and in the process reduced it by nearly half, which included removing some of Wilde&#x27;s recurring &quot;motifs&quot;.

Strauss composed the opera to a German libretto, and that is the version that has become widely known. In 1907, Strauss made an alternate version in French, working with the musicologist Romain Rolland with the objective of retaining as much of the Wilde original as possible, a procedure which also required alterations to the musical score. This French version was used by Mary Garden, the world&#x27;s most famous proponent of the role, when she sang the opera in New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, Paris, and other cities. Marjorie Lawrence sang the role both in French (for Paris) and in German (for the Metropolitan Opera, New York) in the 1930s. The French version is much less well known today, although it was revived in Lyon in 1990, and recorded by Kent Nagano with Karen Huffstodt in the title role and José van Dam as Jochanaan. In 2011, the French version was staged by Opéra Royal de Wallonie in Liège, starring June Anderson.

==Performance history==
The combination of the Christian biblical theme, the erotic and the murderous, which so attracted Wilde to the tale, shocked opera audiences from its first appearance. Some of the original performers were very reluctant to handle the material as written and the Salome, Marie Wittich, &quot;refused to perform the &#x27;Dance of the Seven Veils, thus creating a situation where a dancer stood in for her. This precedent has been largely followed, one early notable exception being that of Aino Ackté, whom Strauss himself dubbed &quot;the one and only Salome&quot;.

&quot;Salome&quot; was first performed at the Königliches Opernhaus in Dresden on 9 December 1905, and within two years, it had been given in 50 other opera houses.

Gustav Mahler could not gain the consent of the Vienna censor to have it performed; therefore it was not given at the Vienna State Opera until 1918. The Austrian premiere was given at the Graz Opera in 1906 under the composer, with Arnold Schoenberg, Giacomo Puccini, Alban Berg, and Gustav Mahler in the audience.

&quot;Salome&quot; was banned in London by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s office until 1907. When it was given its premiere performance at Covent Garden in London under Thomas Beecham on 8 December 1910, it was modified, much to Beecham&#x27;s annoyance and later amusement. In his autobiography, &quot;A Mingled Chime&quot;, Beecham disclosed that some of the performers had ignored the amended text, but nobody noticed. He went on to observe that &quot;Salome served the useful purpose of filling the house every night it was played.&quot;

The United States premiere took place at a special performance by the Metropolitan Opera with Olive Fremstad in the title role with the dance performed by Bianca Froehlich on 22 January 1907. The mixed reviews were summarized &quot;that musicians were impressed by the power displayed by the composer&quot; but &quot;the story is repugnant to Anglo-Saxon minds.&quot; Afterwards, under pressure from wealthy patrons, &quot;further performances were cancelled&quot; and it was not performed there again until 1934. These patrons entreated the visiting Edward Elgar to lead the objections to the work, but he refused point-blank, stating that Strauss was &quot;the greatest genius of the age&quot;.

Mary Garden&#x27;s performance of the French version of &quot;Salome&quot; took place at the Oscar Hammerstein Opera in New York in 1909, in direct competition with the Met.

In 1930, Strauss took part in a festival of his music at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, and conducted &quot;Salome&quot; on 5 November in a version with a slightly reduced orchestration (dictated by the size of the pit).

Today, &quot;Salome&quot; is a well-established part of the operatic repertoire; there are numerous recordings. It has a typical duration of 100 minutes.

== Roles ==

==Synopsis==
&quot;A great terrace in the Palace of Herod, set above the banqueting hall. Some soldiers are leaning over the balcony. To the right there is a gigantic staircase, to the left, at the back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze. The moon is shining very brightly.&quot;

Narraboth gazes from a terrace in Herod&#x27;s palace into the banquet hall at the beautiful Princess Salome; he is in love with her, and apotheosizes her, much to the disgusted fearfulness of the Page of Herodias. The voice of the Prophet Jochanaan is heard from his prison in the palace cistern; Herod fears him and has ordered that no one should contact him, including Jerusalem&#x27;s High Priest.

Tired of the feast and its guests, Salome flees to the terrace. When she hears Jochanaan cursing her mother (Herodias), Salome&#x27;s curiosity is piqued. The palace guards will not honor her petulant orders to fetch Jochanaan for her, so she teasingly works on Narraboth to bring Jochanaan before her. Despite the orders he has received from Herod, Narraboth finally gives in after she promises to smile at him.

Jochanaan emerges from the cistern and shouts prophecies regarding Herod and Herodias that no one understands, except Salome when the Prophet refers to her mother. Upon seeing Jochanaan, Salome is filled with an overwhelming desire for him, praising his white skin and asking to touch it, but he rejects her. She then praises his black hair, again asking to touch it, but is rejected once more. She finally begs for a kiss from Jochanaan&#x27;s lips, and Narraboth, who cannot bear to hear this, kills himself. As Jochanaan is returned to the well, he preaches salvation through the Messiah.

Herod enters, followed by his wife and court. He slips in Narraboth&#x27;s blood and starts hallucinating. He hears the beating of wings. Despite Herodias&#x27; objections, Herod stares lustfully at Salome, who rejects him. Jochanaan harasses Herodias from the well, calling her incestuous marriage to Herod sinful. She demands that Herod silence him. Herod refuses, and she mocks his fear. Five Jews argue concerning the nature of God. Two Nazarenes tell of Christ&#x27;s miracles; at one point they bring up the raising of Jairus&#x27; daughter from the dead, which Herod finds frightening.

Herod asks for Salome to eat with him, drink with him; indolently, she twice refuses, saying she is not hungry or thirsty. Herod then begs Salome to dance for him, &quot;Tanz für mich, Salome,&quot; though her mother objects. He promises to reward her with her heart&#x27;s desire—even if it were one half of his kingdom.
After Salome inquires into his promise, and he swears to honor it, she prepares for the &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;. This dance, very oriental in orchestration, has her slowly removing her seven veils, until she lies naked at his feet. Salome then demands the head of the prophet on a silver platter. Her mother cackles in pleasure. Herod tries to dissuade her with offers of jewels, peacocks, and the sacred veil of the Temple. Salome remains firm in her demand for Jochanaan&#x27;s head, forcing Herod to accede to her demands. After a desperate monologue by Salome, an executioner emerges from the well and delivers the severed head as she requested.

Salome now declares her love for the severed head, caressing it and kissing the prophet&#x27;s dead lips passionately. Horrified, Herod orders his soldiers, &quot;Kill that woman!&quot; They rush forward and crush Salome under their shields.

==Instrumentation==

Strauss scored &quot;Salome&quot; for the following large orchestra:
*Woodwinds: piccolo, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, heckelphone, E-flat clarinet, 2 clarinets in B-flat, 2 clarinets in A, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon
*Brass: 6 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba
*Percussion (8–9 players): 5 timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tam-tam, tambourine, castanets, glockenspiel, xylophone
*Keyboards: celesta, harmonium (offstage), organ (offstage)
*Strings: 2 harps, 16 violins I, 16 violins II, 10–12 violas, 10 violoncellos, 8 double basses
The instrumentation contains several notes for strings and woodwinds that are unplayable because they are too low; Strauss was aware of this.

==Music==
The music of &quot;Salome&quot; includes a system of leitmotifs, or short melodies with rich and symbolic meanings. Some are clearly associated with people such as Salome and Jochanaan (John the Baptist). Others are more abstract in meaning. Strauss&#x27;s use of leitmotifs is complex, with both symbolism and musical form subject to ambiguity and transformation. Some leitmotifs, especially those associated with Herod, change frequently in form and symbolic meaning, making it futile to pin them down to a specific meaning. Strauss provided names for some of the leitmotifs, but not consistently, and other people have assigned a variety of names. These names often illustrate the ambiguity of certain leitmotifs. For example, Gilman&#x27;s labels tend to be abstract (such as &quot;Yearning&quot;, &quot;Anger&quot;, and &quot;Fear&quot;), while Otto Roese&#x27;s are more concrete (he called Gilman&#x27;s &quot;Fear&quot; leitmotif &quot;Herod&#x27;s Scale&quot;). Regarding the important leitmotif associated with Jochanaan, which has two parts, Gilman called the first part &quot;Jochanaan&quot; and the second part &quot;Prophecy&quot;, while Roese labels them the other way around. Labels for the leitmotifs are common, but there is no final authority. Derrick Puffett cautions against reading too much into any such labels. In addition to the leitmotifs, there are many symbolic uses of musical color in the opera&#x27;s music. For example, a tambourine sounds every time a reference to Salome&#x27;s dance is made.

The harmony of &quot;Salome&quot; makes use of extended tonality, chromaticism, a wide range of keys, unusual modulations, tonal ambiguity, and polytonality. Some of the major characters have keys associated with them, such as Salome and Jochanaan, as do some of the major psychological themes, such as desire and death.

Strauss edited the opera&#x27;s libretto, in the process cutting almost half of Wilde&#x27;s play, stripping it down and emphasizing its basic dramatic structure. The structural form of the libretto is highly patterned, notably in the use of symmetry and the hierarchical grouping of events, passages, and sections in threes. Examples of three-part structure include Salome&#x27;s attempt to seduce Narraboth, in order to get him to let her see Jochanaan. She tries to seduce him three times, and he capitulates on the third. When Jochanaan is brought before Salome he issues three prophecies, after which Salome professes love for Jochanaan three times—love of his skin, his hair, and his lips, the last of which results in Jochanaan cursing her. In the following scene Herod three times asks Salome to be with him—to drink, eat, and sit with him. She refuses each time. Later Herod asks her to dance for him, again three times. Twice she refuses, but the third time Herod swears to give her whatever she wants in return and she accepts. After she dances and says she wants Jochanaan&#x27;s head on a platter, Herod, not wanting to execute the Prophet, makes three offers—an emerald, peacocks, and finally, desperately, the Veil of the Sanctuary of the Holy of Holies. Salome rejects all three offers, each time more stridently insisting on Jochanaan&#x27;s head. Three-part groupings occur elsewhere on both larger and smaller levels.
In the final scene of the opera, after Salome kisses Jochanaan&#x27;s severed head, the music builds to a dramatic climax, which ends with a cadence involving a very dissonant unorthodox chord one measure before rehearsal 361. This single chord has been widely commented on. It has been called &quot;the most sickening chord in all opera&quot;, an &quot;epoch-making dissonance with which Strauss takes Salome...to the depth of degradation&quot;, and &quot;the quintessence of Decadence: here is ecstasy falling in upon itself, crumbling into the abyss&quot;. The chord is often described as polytonal, with a low A7 (a dominant seventh chord) merged with a higher F-sharp major chord. It forms part of a cadence in the key of C-sharp major and is approached and resolved from C–sharp major chords. Not only is the chord shockingly dissonant, especially in its musical context and rich orchestration, it has broader significance due in part to Strauss&#x27;s careful use of keys and leitmotifs to symbolize the opera&#x27;s characters, emotions such as desire, lust, revulsion, and horror, as well as doom and death. A great deal has been written about this single chord and its function within the large-scale formal structure of the entire opera.

==The role of Salome==

The vocal demands of the title-role are the same as those of an Isolde, Brünnhilde, or Turandot, in that, ideally, the role requires the volume, stamina, and power of a true dramatic soprano. The common theme of these four roles is the difficulty in casting an ideal soprano who has a truly dramatic voice as well as being able to register as a young woman.

Nevertheless, Maria Cebotari, Ljuba Welitsch, Birgit Nilsson, Leonie Rysanek, Éva Marton, Radmila Bakočević, Montserrat Caballé, Anja Silja, Phyllis Curtin, Karan Armstrong, Nancy Shade, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Catherine Malfitano, Hildegard Behrens, Maria Ewing, Teresa Stratas (only in a film version, not on stage), Olive Fremstad, Brenda Lewis, Karita Mattila, Nina Stemme, Patricia Racette, Malin Byström, Elza van den Heever, Elena Stikhina, Asmik Grigorian, Lise Davidsen and Sylvia Sass are among the most memorable who have tackled the role in the last half-century. Each of these singers has brought her own interpretation to the title character. Perhaps the two most famous recordings of the opera are Herbert von Karajan&#x27;s EMI recording with Hildegard Behrens and Sir Georg Solti&#x27;s Decca recording with Birgit Nilsson as Salome.

In addition to the vocal and physical demands, the role also calls for the agility and gracefulness of a prima ballerina when performing the opera&#x27;s famous &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;. Finding one individual with all of these qualities is extremely daunting. Due to the complexity of the role&#x27;s demands, some of its performers have had a purely vocal focus by opting to leave the dancing to stand-ins who are professional dancers. Others have opted to combine the two and perform the dance themselves, which is closer to Strauss&#x27;s intentions. In either case, at the end of the &quot;Dance of the Seven Veils&quot;, some sopranos (or their stand-ins) wear a body stocking under the veils, while others (notably Malfitano, Mattila and Ewing) have appeared nude at the conclusion of the dance.

As for the required vocal range of the title role, it is an extraordinary case: the highest note is the high B5, not irregular for a soprano or mezzo-soprano to sing, while the lowest note is a low G3, in the contralto range and officially below the standard range for a mezzo-soprano. Considering this range, which is similar to many mezzo roles (such as Carmen and Amneris), one might assume that a high soprano is not essential to the piece, but it is; most of the relatively low sopranos who attempted this role found themselves straining their voices throughout the opera, and having reached the closing scene (the most important part of the opera for the title role) were very fatigued. This role is the classic example of the difference between tessitura and absolute vocal range: While mezzos can perform a high note (like Carmen), or even temporarily sustain a high tessitura, it is impossible for a singer to spend such a long time (with the needed strength and breath-control) in the second octave above the middle C unless she is a high soprano. Moreover, the low G occurs twice in the opera, and in both cases it is in pianissimo—more of a theatrical effect than music—and can be growled instead of sung. The other low notes required are no lower than low A, and they are also quiet.

==Transcriptions==
The English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote in 1947 a piano transcription of the closing scene of the opera, entitled &quot;Schluß-Szene aus &quot;Salome&quot; von Richard Strauss—Konzertmäßige Übertragung für Klavier zu zwei Händen&quot; (&quot;Final Scene from &quot;Salome&quot; by Richard Strauss – Concert Transcription arranged for Piano, two hands&quot;).

<text>Anderson Luís de Souza (born 27 August 1977), also known as Deco (), is a former professional footballer who primarily played as an attacking or central midfielder. Born and raised in Brazil, he acquired Portuguese citizenship and played for Portugal. He is regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation. He currently works as sporting director in Barcelona.

Deco is one of the few players to have won the UEFA Champions League with two clubs, with Porto in 2004 and Barcelona in 2006. He was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year and UEFA Best Midfielder in Porto&#x27;s Champions League-winning season and was named Man of the Match in the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final. Deco was the first player to win the UEFA Best Midfielder Award with two clubs, Porto and Barcelona. He was awarded the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup Golden Ball and the Man of the Match award in the final despite losing to Internacional.

Deco received Portuguese citizenship in 2002 having completed five years of Portuguese residence, and subsequently opted to play internationally for the Portugal national team. He earned 75 caps for them, playing at two UEFA European Championships and two FIFA World Cups, reaching the final of Euro 2004, and achieving a fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in São Bernardo do Campo, Deco spent time at Corinthians as a youngster, competing in the Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior for them. In the 1997 edition, Benfica sent Toni to scout the tournament, and he soon noticed Deco, recommending his signing. In June 1997, Benfica purchased his rights from CSA and immediately sent him on loan (along with fellow Brazilian Caju) to their farm team, Alverca. After helping them win promotion to the top tier in 1997–98 season by scoring 13 goals in 32 appearances, he returned to Benfica in July 1998. However, he left for Salgueiros in exchange for Nandinho, who went in the opposite direction. When asked by Nuno Gomes in an interview for &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; why he did not stay and become a legend at Benfica, Deco said, &quot;Benfica decided, it wasn&#x27;t my decision. They didn&#x27;t want me. The coach was Graeme Souness at the time. I was young and Benfica needed some players.&quot;

At Salgueiros, Deco was plagued by injuries and only made a few appearances, until Porto purchased him in March 1999, in time to win the league title. His release from Benfica and subsequent success with Porto was considered by António Simões as an &quot;historical mistake&quot;, while Toni stated he saw in Deco, a successor for Rui Costa the club needed since his departure.

===Porto===
In his first season with Porto, Deco scored a goal after just 30.08 seconds in a 1–0 away win against Molde in the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League.

Under the guidance of manager José Mourinho in the 2002–03 season, Deco scored 10 goals in 30 matches and received 17 yellow cards and 1 red card. He was one of the key players in Porto&#x27;s UEFA Cup final 3–2 win over Celtic that year. In the 2003–04 season, Deco helped Porto recapture the national title and led the team to the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, in which Porto won 3–0 over Monaco, scoring the second goal of the match. He was the UEFA Champions League&#x27;s top assist provider and also suffered the most fouls in the Champions League that season. That season, Deco also won the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year as well as the award for the best midfielder in the competition.

===Barcelona===

A deal was achieved between Porto and Barcelona the day after the Euro 2004 final. Barcelona agreed on a €15 million fee in cash, plus the complete rights of Ricardo Quaresma to Porto, which tagged Quaresma for €6 million. 

On 14 May 2005, Deco played in the draw against Levante, which gave Barcelona their 17th La Liga title. He also was named Barcelona&#x27;s player of the season in the 2005–06 season.

Deco scored twice in the 2006 Supercopa de España, which Barça won. Deco won the UEFA Best Midfielder Award yet again for his performance in Barça&#x27;s UEFA Champions League-winning season, enabling him to join the exclusive group of players that have won the same award more than once with different teams, having won the Champions League previously with Porto. He was also awarded the Golden Ball at the FIFA Club World Cup and the Man of the Match award, despite losing the final to Internacional.

===Chelsea===

On 30 June 2008, Premier League team Chelsea signed Deco from Barcelona on a three-year contract for €10 million (£8 million). He was the first signing of new Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who was formerly the head coach of the Portugal national team.

Deco scored on his debut with a 30-yard goal in a 4–0 league victory over Portsmouth. Deco followed up his performance by scoring in his second game for Chelsea, a curling free-kick against Wigan Athletic. These performances led to him winning the Premier League Player of the Month award for August. Deco made his Champions League debut for Chelsea on 16 September. Deco injured himself during a training session, but he returned from the thigh injury on 19 October and came on as a substitute against Middlesbrough. He was sent off in the 3–1 defeat by Roma on 4 November 2008. He then scored a bicycle kick against Bolton Wanderers on 6 December.

Deco eventually lost his place in the 2008–09 starting line up, due in part to some poor performances, but also to the sacking of Scolari. In a June interview, Deco said, &quot;I do not want to stay. I have not liked my experience at Chelsea.&quot; This was soon followed by Inter Milan, managed by former Chelsea manager José Mourinho, declaring Inter was attempting to sign Deco along with fellow countryman Ricardo Carvalho, who had also declared his desire to leave and, like Deco, desired to link-up with Mourinho again. Both players previously played under Mourinho at Porto. However, Inter club president Massimo Moratti ruled out signing either of the Portuguese internationals on the basis of their age, telling &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, &quot;Deco and Carvalho? They are two champions but at this time I don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a need to buy them.&quot;

===Fluminense===
On 6 August 2010, Deco signed a two-year contract with Brazilian club Fluminense on a free transfer, joining former Chelsea and Barcelona teammate Juliano Belletti. Playing for Fluminense, Deco won the Campeonato Brasileiro in 2010 and 2012.

On 26 August 2013, Deco retired, ending a 17-year career. The decision came on the day before his 36th birthday. His final match was four days prior, against Goiás.

==International career==

Deco was never called up to the Brazil national team, as the Brazil squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup included other attacking midfielders such as Ronaldinho, Rivaldo and Juninho. After completing six years of residence in Portugal, he was able to gain Portuguese citizenship and play for their national team. As none of his great-grandparents, grandparents or parents were Portuguese, under FIFA&#x27;s player eligibility rules his citizenship was the only factor to allow him to play for Portugal. He was subsequently mentioned several times in the media as an option for the Portugal national team.

After many months of public discussion which split Portuguese public opinion, and despite the opposition of a large number of Porto rivals&#x27; supporters, he was called up for his first international, coincidentally against Brazil. He came on as a substitute for Sérgio Conceição and scored the free-kick which won the match 2–1. This was Portugal&#x27;s first win over Brazil since the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Since that match, he became a regular in the national team. Before UEFA Euro 2004, Luís Figo criticised Deco&#x27;s inclusion and said, &quot;Se você nasceu chinês, bem, você tem que jogar pela China.&quot;
(English: &quot;If you&#x27;re born Chinese, well, you have to play for China.&quot;) Deco responded, &quot;Eu nasci no Brasil e seria uma mentira dizer que sou português agora e não brasileiro. Mas amo Portugal e adoro jogar pela seleção.&quot; (English:&quot;I was born in Brazil and it would be a lie to say that I&#x27;m Portuguese now and not Brazilian. But I love Portugal and I love playing for the national team.&quot;)

Despite the early criticism, Deco was one of the highlights of the Portugal national team. He scored 5 goals in 75 caps for Portugal by June 2010, when his international career ended after the second-round defeat to Spain at the 2010 World Cup.

===2006 World Cup===
In the 2006 World Cup, Deco scored the first goal in Portugal&#x27;s second Group D match against Iran in the 63rd minute prior to Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s 80th-minute penalty. During the first knockout stage of the competition, Deco received two yellow cards in the match against the Netherlands with the first given for a rash tackle on John Heitinga, suspending him from the quarter-final win against England, as he had already picked up a caution in the match with Iran. The win against England in the quarter-final stage led to Portugal&#x27;s defeat in the semi-final, which Deco was able to participate in.

===Euro 2008===
On 11 June, Deco scored the opening goal in Portugal&#x27;s second match of Euro 2008, a Group A clash with the Czech Republic. The match ended 3–1 to Portugal, with Deco aiding his team in their passage to the quarter-finals where Portugal&#x27;s campaign came to an end against Germany, the eventual runners-up of the tournament.

In February 2010, Deco announced he would be retiring from international football after the 2010 World Cup.

===2010 World Cup===
Deco played for Portugal in their opening game against the Ivory Coast. During the match, he was injured and was ruled out of the remaining two group matches, against North Korea and Brazil. He was fit again for the round of 16 match against Spain, but Portugal head coach Carlos Queiroz chose Tiago over him.

Deco retired from international football with 75 caps and 5 goals.

==Style of play==
As a player, Deco was a versatile, tactically intelligent and creative midfielder with excellent vision and technical ability. A generous and hard-working team-player capable of playing in several midfield positions. He was initially used as a central midfielder under manager José Mourinho during his time with Porto, although he was also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder, as a deep-lying playmaker or as a winger on either flank. What he lacked in pace as well as physical, defensive and athletic attributes, he made up for in stamina, as well as excellent ball control, dribbling skills, passing range and crossing ability, which allowed him to beat players, find space and create chances for teammates. Deco was an excellent visionary with the ball, who opened up spaces for his teammates through finding passing lanes that no one else saw, and also had a notable ability to switch the tempo of play in rapid style.

A diminutive midfielder, in later years, as he lost his acceleration, agility and mobility, he also went through a physical development, which, along with his balance, allowed him to protect the ball against larger opponents. He also contributed offensively with occasional goals due to his accurate mid-range shooting ability, and his adeptness at free-kicks. Despite his talent, Deco was also known to be injury-prone and inconsistent at times, and was also accused of drifting in and out of matches. Furthermore, his work-rate and fitness were often brought into question in his later career. Deco was also well known for his tendency to commit tactical fouls, and he was accused of diving throughout his career.

==Post-retirement==

On 16 August 2023, it was announced that Deco would become the sporting director of his former club Barcelona by signing a three-year contract.

==Personal life==
Deco is the brother-in-law of fellow former footballers Alecsandro and Richarlyson. Deco is an ambassador for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation. He also has a charitable organisation, the Deco Institute, based in the Brazilian city of Indaiatuba, near São Paulo, where he grew up.

After retiring, Deco set up D20 Sports Management, a sports agency registered in Dublin, Ireland. The agency, whose clients include Brazil international Fabinho and Burkina Faso international Edmond Tapsoba, recorded €300,000 profit in 2017.

==Media==
Deco features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; football video game series. He was included in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 16&quot;.

<text>The  (; ), officially Law No. 3,353 of 13 May 1888, is the law that abolished slavery in Brazil. It was signed by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921), an opponent of slavery, who acted as regent to Emperor Pedro II, who was in Europe.

The &quot;Lei Áurea&quot; was preceded by the Rio Branco Law of 28 September 1871 (&quot;the Law of Free Birth&quot;), which freed all children born to slave parents, and by the Saraiva-Cotegipe Law (also known as &quot;the Law of Sexagenarians&quot;), of 28 September 1885, that freed slaves when they reached the age of 60. Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery.

== Background ==
Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves.

== Text ==
The text of the was brief:
== Analysis ==
The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. However, it did not provide any support to either freed slaves or their former owners to adjust their lives to their new status: slave owners did not receive any state indemnification, and slaves did not receive any kind of compensation from owners or assistance from the state.

Before the abolition of slavery, slaves were prohibited from owning assets or receiving an education; but after being freed, former slaves were left to make their own way in the world. Without education or political representation, former slaves struggled to gain economic and social status in Brazilian society.

The was authored by Rodrigo A. da Silva, then Minister of Agriculture in the cabinet headed by prime minister João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira, and member of the Chamber of Deputies. After passing both houses of the General Assembly, it was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921), who was regent at the time, while her father, emperor Pedro II, was in Europe. 

The Golden Law was signed by the princess imperial and countersigned by Rodrigo A. da Silva, in his capacity as Minister of Agriculture. Princess Isabel, who was a staunch supporter of the abolitionist movement, was awarded the Golden Rose by Pope Leo XIII and minister Rodrigo A. da Silva received honors from the Vatican, France and Portugal. In August 1888 Rodrigo A. da Silva went on to be chosen for a lifetime seat in the Senate of the Empire.

The had other consequences besides the freeing of all slaves; without slaves and lacking workers, the plantation owners had to recruit workers elsewhere and thus organized, in the 1890s, the (&quot;Society for the Promotion of Immigration&quot;). Another effect was an uproar among Brazilian slave owners and upper classes, resulting in the toppling of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic in 1889 – the is often regarded as the most immediate (but not the only) cause of the fall of monarchy in Brazil.

<text>Eldest is the second novel in &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot; by Christopher Paolini and the sequel to &quot;Eragon&quot;. It was first published in hardcover on August 23, 2005, and was released in paperback in September 2006. &quot;Eldest&quot; has been released in an audiobook format, and as an ebook. Like &quot;Eragon&quot;, &quot;Eldest&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. A deluxe edition of &quot;Eldest&quot; was released on September 26, 2006, including new information and art by both the illustrator and the author. Other editions of &quot;Eldest&quot; are translated into different languages.

&quot;Eldest&quot; begins following several important events in &quot;Eragon&quot;. The story is the continued adventures of Eragon and his dragon Saphira, centering on their journey to the realm of the Elves in order to further Eragon&#x27;s training as a Dragon Rider. Other plots in the story focus on Roran, Eragon&#x27;s cousin, who leads the inhabitants of Carvahall to Surda to join the Varden, and Nasuada as she takes on her father&#x27;s role as leader of the Varden.

Reviews pointed out the similarities between &quot;Eldest&quot; and other works such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, while praising the themes of the book, such as friendship and honor. Several of these reviews commented on the style and genre of &quot;Eldest&quot;, while others considered the possibility of a film adaptation similar to the first film.

== Plot synopsis ==

=== Setting ===
&quot;Eldest&quot; begins three days after the events of the preceding novel, &quot;Eragon&quot;, in the dwarf city of Tronjheim, inside of a hollowed mountain named Farthen Dûr. &quot;Farthen Dûr&quot; is in the southeastern part of Alagaësia, the fictional continent where &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot; takes place. Throughout the novel, the protagonists travel to many different places: Ellesméra, the elven capital city in the forest Du Weldenvarden, on the northern portion of Alagaësia; Carvahall, a small town located on the northwestern part of Alagaësia in Palancar Valley; and Aberon, the capital of Surda, in the southern portion of Alagaësia.

The story is told in third-person through protagonists Eragon, Roran, and Nasuada. Eragon is nearly always accompanied by his dragon Saphira. Due to the multiple points-of-view, multiple stories take place concurrently, and the protagonist characters do not meet often. Several other characters return from &quot;Eragon&quot;, including Arya (the elf warrior, daughter of the elven queen), Orik, Roran (Eragon&#x27;s cousin and a major character), Ajihad (the leader of the Varden, who dies and is replaced by his daughter Nasuada), and Angela (the herbalist). Some new characters are introduced in &quot;Eldest&quot;, such as Oromis and his dragon Glaedr. Murtagh appears briefly as a minor protagonist but then reappears later as a primary antagonist with his dragon, Thorn.

=== Plot ===
&quot;Eldest&quot; begins as Ajihad, the leader of the rebel Varden force, is ambushed and killed, while The Twins and Murtagh are assumed dead. Ajihad&#x27;s daughter Nasuada is elected to command the Varden, and decides to move them to Surda and oppose the Empire openly. Eragon and Saphira decide to travel to the forest Du Weldenvarden to be trained as a Dragon Rider by the elves. The dwarf king, Hrothgar, adopts Eragon to his clan and has his now foster brother, Orik, accompany him to the forest. There, Eragon meets the stranger who had contacted him, revealed to be a Rider, Oromis, with his Dragon Glaedr, the only Dragon and Rider secretly alive. However, both are crippled, and so cannot fight Galbatorix directly, choosing to pass on their knowledge. Eragon and Saphira are taught the use of logic, magic theory, scholarship, and combat, among other things.

However, having received a back injury in the previous book, Eragon is beset by agonizing seizures, which debilitate him. He also struggles with his romantic feelings for Arya, while Saphira has similar struggles toward Glaedr. Arya becomes aware of his feelings, and distances herself from him, while Saphira is violently rejected by Glaedr, though the two come to an understanding afterwards. Eventually, in an ancient elven ceremony, the Agaetí Blödhren, Eragon is affected by powerful magic, turning him into an elf-human hybrid, and healing his back injury. He makes another romantic attempt on Arya, but she gently rejects him, and leaves to rejoin the Varden.

Meanwhile, unknowing of all of this, Eragon&#x27;s cousin Roran, returning home after hearing of his father&#x27;s death, plans to marry Katrina, daughter of Sloan, the village butcher, while the village is unexpectedly attacked by Galbatorix&#x27;s soldiers and the Ra&#x27;zac, who had killed Garrow. Roran fights the soldiers with a hammer, which becomes his signature weapon while the entire village mounts a defence, during which Roran proposes to Katrina, but ignites a feud between himself and Sloan in the process. One night, Roran wakes up to find Katrina being taken by the Ra&#x27;zac, who sneaked into the house. They seriously injure him and capture Katrina. Sloan, revealed to be in league with the Ra&#x27;zac, is then knocked out and flown away by them, along with Katrina, on their mounts and parents, the Lethrblaka.

Torn between chasing after Katrina and staying behind to defend his home, Roran rallies almost the entirety of the village to travel to Surda and join the Varden. On the way, they journey to Teirm, where Roran meets Jeod, Brom&#x27;s friend, who informs him about Eragon, and decides to go with them. With Jeod&#x27;s help, they steal a ship, and journey toward Surda by sea.

Meanwhile, Nasuada struggles under the burdens of leadership. She hatches a plan to fund them by selling magically-crafted lace, to alleviate their financial troubles. She also meets Elva, a child supposedly blessed by Eragon in the previous book. Eragon is revealed to have botched the blessing with poor phrasing, accidentally forcing Elva to feel the pain of others. Elva uses her abilities to save Nasuada from an assassination attempt. Nasuada eventually learns that Galbatorix is fielding a massive army against them, and sends for help from the dwarves and Eragon. 

Eragon has a prophetic dream of the coming battle, and decides to interrupt his training to aid the Varden in battle. Oromis consents and provides him with numerous gifts to help him, but insists he return to finish his training after the battle. He journeys with Saphira and Orik to the Varden&#x27;s camp, reuniting with Nasuada and Arya, and meeting Elva, promising to rid her of his failed blessing and reconciling with Arya. The Varden are then joined by an army of Urgals, led by Nar Garzhvog, who seek an alliance with them after being freed of Durza&#x27;s control. 

As the battle begins, it goes poorly for the massively outnumbered Varden. Roran and the dwarves arrive mid-battle, and begin to turn the tide in favor of the Varden, but an unknown Dragon Rider unexpectedly arrives and kills Hrothgar. Eragon engages this Rider, who proves an even match, and unmasks him, revealing him to be Murtagh. Murtagh reveals he was kidnapped by the Twins, who had betrayed the Varden. After the dragon, named Thorn, had hatched for him, they were both forced into swearing loyalty by Galbatorix in the ancient language, binding them to his will. Meanwhile, the battle proceeds, with the Twins revealing themselves and causing massive losses among the Varden, until Roran kills them.

Murtagh and Eragon resume their fight, with Murtagh easily defeating Eragon through magic. He shows mercy to him, on account of their old friendship, but takes Eragon&#x27;s sword Zar&#x27;roc, which he claims to be his inheritance, revealing that he and Eragon are brothers, making Eragon a son of Morzan, the first of the traitorous Riders known as the Forsworn who was later killed by Brom. 

Ultimately, the Varden win the battle. The book ends as Roran asks Eragon for help in rescuing Katrina, to which he agrees.

== Critical reaction ==
&quot;Eldest&quot; received generally negative reviews, and was met with criticism similar to &quot;Eragon&quot; for its derivative nature. &quot;School Library Journal&quot; noted that &quot;Eldest&quot; lacked originality, but would still find reception among fans. It also acknowledged that themes of &quot;Eldest&quot; are based generally on the works of other writers. &quot;BookBrowse&quot; also criticized &quot;Eldest&quot;, but said, as &quot;School Library Journal&quot; noted, that nothing the reviewers can say will stop some children from reading the book. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated &quot;Eldest&quot; as one of the worst five books of 2005, calling it a &quot;700-page drag.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; gave a negative review for &quot;Eldest&quot;, criticizing the very low points and for &quot;drama that rises to a wet pop.&quot; &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; gave &quot;Eldest&quot; a C+ grade. Similar to other reviews, it criticized the long plot and its similarities to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, as well as the lack of humor. The review commented that Roran, one of the secondary major characters, had the best part of the book. &quot;SFSignal&quot; also gave &quot;Eldest&quot; a poor review, giving it one out of five stars. The main reason of this was for its dull pace. The SFSignal review, like &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, did say that Roran had the &quot;strongest sequence&quot; in the book.

However, there were also some more positive reviews of &quot;Eldest&quot;. &quot;Bookmarks magazine&quot; saw &quot;Eldest&quot;&#x27;s similarity to other works, but said that &quot;Eldest&quot; displayed more emotional depth than &quot;Eragon&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; also gave a positive review for &quot;Eldest&quot;, praising the revelations in the final pages. Barnes &amp; Noble gave a positive review for &quot;Eldest&quot;, in particular for its style, characters and themes such as friendship, forgiveness, responsibility, and honor. &quot;Eldest&quot; won the 2006 Quill Award in Young Adult Literature. &quot;Eldest&quot; also was nominated for a British Book Award in the Children&#x27;s Book of the Year section, the Disney Adventures Book Award, the Colorado Blue Spruce Award, Young Adult Book Award, and the Wyoming Soaring Eagle Book Award.

== Themes ==
Several themes in &quot;Eldest&quot; have been noted. A Barnes &amp; Noble reviewer praised the honor, friendship, responsibility, and forgiveness in the book. The reviewer called these themes &quot;age-transcendent&quot;. School Library Journal commented on how Eragon looked for a definition for good and evil. A third review, while not identifying any specific themes, said the author was &quot;layering his themes&quot; to make the book more exciting. Another review praised the story for the themes of power, family, and maturing. Paolini commented on the theme in &quot;Eldest&quot; of vegetarianism:
&quot;One of my goals as an author is to explore various aspects of human nature. It&#x27;s my job, then, to attempt to understand why people act, even if it differs from my own point of view or practice, and to present those reasons to the best of my ability. The actions and beliefs of my characters are not necessarily my own.&quot;

There are also themes of religion and atheism, the dwarves being highly religious, the elves being atheists, and Eragon, growing up without a religious background but a set of superstitions, wondering if there are higher powers.

== Literary style and genre ==
&quot;Eldest&quot; falls in the genre of juvenile fiction and fantasy. Reviews often commented on how &quot;Eldest&quot; borrowed from the fantasy genre. Other reviews criticized and praised the writing style of the author. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, while noting that the writing was more mature, criticized the novel for being inconsistent. An &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; review was negative toward the story because it was slow-paced, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;Eldest&quot; needed to be shortened. A reviewer from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said:
&quot;He is to English as a bad dog to a chainsaw: he worries it, and worries it, and devastation spreads around him.&quot;
On the other hand, Barnes &amp; Noble called the writing style fluid and &quot;Children&#x27;s Literature&quot; praised the story for being richly detailed. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; compared the story to a patchwork of fantasy elements and characters, then concluded that it, despite being derivative, was exciting and held together well.

== Limited editions ==
A deluxe version of Eldest called the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; was released on September 26, 2006. It was published by Random House. The deluxe edition included an excerpt of &quot;Brisingr&quot;, a poster of Glaedr (which would become the cover art for Brisingr), the history of Alagaësia, art by Christopher Paolini, and a list of characters, places, objects, and dwarf clans. The deluxe edition was also released in an Ebook format.

&quot;Eldest&quot; has been published in forty-one countries, several translations from English into different languages have been made. Translations for languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Serbian have appeared. Worldwide &quot;Eldest&quot; has several publishers including Gailivro, which publishes the Polish and Portuguese &quot;Eldest&quot;, and Gramedia Pustaka Utama, the publisher of the Indonesian translations.

An omnibus of &quot;Eragon&quot; and &quot;Eldest&quot; was published on July 8, 2008 and included then-unseen manuscripts by Paolini.

<text>A transit of Venus was observed from Earth on 8 June 2004. The event received significant attention, since it was the first Venus transit after the invention of broadcast media. No human alive at the time had witnessed a previous Venus transit since that transit occurred on 6 December 1882 in the 19th century.

The European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE) launched the VT-2004 project, together with the Institut de Mécanique Céleste et de Calcul des Éphémérides (IMCCE) and the Observatoire de Paris in France, as well as the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. This project had 2,763 participants all over the world, including nearly 1,000 school classes. The participants made a measurement of the astronomical unit (AU) of 149 608 708 km ± 11 835 km which had only a 0.007% difference to the accepted value.

==Visibility==
The entire transit was visible from Europe, most of Asia, and almost all of Africa. The beginning was visible before sunset from easternmost Asia and Australia. The end was visible after sunrise from the westernmost fringe of Africa, eastern North America, and much of South America. The transit was not visible at all from western North America, southern South America, Hawaii, or New Zealand. The regions from which the transit were visible are shown on the map to the right.
==Timing==
The following table and image give times for various events (respectively, first contact, second contact, the midpoint, third contact and fourth contact) during the transit on 8 June 2004 for a hypothetical observer at the center of the Earth. Due to parallax, times observed at different points on Earth may differ from the following by as much as ±7 minutes.

<doc id="711964" wikidata="Q2161108" url="?curid=711964" title="Bramhall">
<text>Bramhall is a large village in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England. At the 2021 census, the built-up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics had a population of 17,195. Bramhall was formerly a civil parish in Cheshire. The parish was abolished in 1900 to become part of Hazel Grove and Bramhall, which was in turn abolished in 1974 to become part of the metropolitan borough of Stockport.

==History==
In 1066 the Anglo-Saxon manor of Bramall was held as separate estates by two freemen, Brun and Hakon. In 1070, William the Conqueror subdued the north-west of England, and divided the land among his followers. The manor was given to Hamon de Massey, who eventually became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. The earliest reference to Bramall was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Bramale&quot;, a name derived from the Old English words &quot;brom&quot; meaning broom, both indigenous to the area, and &quot;halh&quot; meaning nook or secret place, probably by water. De Massey received the manor as wasteland, since it had been devastated in the &quot;Harrying of the North&quot;. By the time of the Domesday survey, the land was recovering and cultivated again.

==Governance==
There is one main tier of local government covering Bramhall, at metropolitan borough level: Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. The council is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Greater Manchester.

Bramhall is part of the parliamentary constituency of Cheadle, represented by Liberal Democrat Tom Morrison since 2024.

===Administrative history===
Bramhall was historically a township in the ancient parish of Stockport, which formed part of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Stockport, the civil functions were exercised by each township rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so Bramhall became a civil parish.

As well as the village of Bramhall, the township included surrounding rural areas and extended to include the south-western side of the village of Hazel Grove, which straddled four townships: Bosden, Bramhall, Norbury, and Torkington.

When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894, Bramhall was given a parish council and included in the Stockport Rural District. Shortly afterwards, Stockport Borough Council began campaigning to have the various small parishes just outside its southern boundaries (most of which had formerly been townships in the parish of Stockport) incorporated into the County Borough of Stockport. The five parish councils of Bramhall, Bosden, Norbury, Offerton and Torkington collectively decided that they wished to resist being brought into Stockport, and therefore petitioned Cheshire County Council to create an urban district covering the combined area of their five parishes. The county council agreed, and the parish of Bramhall was therefore abolished in September 1900, with the area becoming part of the new civil parish and urban district of Hazel Grove and Bramhall.

In 1891 (the last census before the abolition of the parish), Bramhall had a population of 3,365.

Although Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District included Bramhall in its name, the council was always based in Hazel Grove, initially at offices on London Road, then at Torkington Lodge from 1937.

Hazel Grove and Bramhall was abolished in 1974 to become part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester.

==Landmarks==

Bramall Hall, set in of parkland, is an example of a 14th-century Cheshire building. In 2016 an extensive programme of restoration work was completed. The Ladybrook flows westward through the park, joining the River Mersey at Cheadle.

Bramhall War Memorial is in Mayfield Place. It was unveiled by Sir Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle on 18 December 1921. It commemorates the 90 men of Bramhall who fell in the two world wars.

==Churches==

The Church of England parish church of St Michael and All Angels in Robins Lane was consecrated in 1911 when Bramhall ecclesiastical parish was created, although the building was not completed until 1963. It replaced an earlier mission church opened in 1890.

Other churches in Bramhall include the Methodist Church near the centre of the village, the United Reformed Church located on Bramhall Lane South, the Baptist Church located on Woodford Road, the Roman Catholic Church of St. Vincent de Paul on Handley Road and Ford&#x27;s Lane Evangelical Church.&#x27;

==Recreation==
Bramhall has a cricket club and there are three lawn tennis clubs (LTC): Bramhall Queensgate LTC, to the north; Bramhall Lane LTC, close to the village; and Bramhall Park LTC, close to the park. There are also two golf clubs in Bramhall, each with 18-hole courses: Bramhall Golf Club and Bramall Park Golf Club. Stockport RUFC in Bramhall has been host to Headlander Festival. There is a recreation centre linked with Bramhall High School with indoor and outdoor facilities.

==Transport==
Bramhall railway station is on a spur of the West Coast Main Line between Manchester Piccadilly and London Euston, via Macclesfield and Stoke-on-Trent. Local trains stop every hour Monday-Saturday on their way to/from Manchester Piccadilly and Stoke-on-Trent; there is a much reduced service on Sundays.

Bus services link Bramhall with Manchester (42B), Stockport (378/9), Cheadle Hulme (42B,307/8), Woodford (42B), Parrs Wood (42B) and Hazel Grove (307/8). Routes are predominantly operated by Stagecoach Manchester.

==Housing==
Bramhall has a high number of Edwardian and some Victorian houses, particularly around the village centre and along the main roads (and side roads) leading towards Bramhall Park, Cheadle Hulme and Woodford. In addition, there are several older listed buildings in the area. These contribute to the historic character of the village. There are also several 1930s-1950s houses in the area. The 1960s and early 1970s saw a growth in Bramhall&#x27;s housing stock. New developments included the Parkside and New House Farm areas in the north of Bramhall nearer to the park. Closer to the village centre lies the Dairyground estate and the Little Australia estate, so called as many roads are named after locations in Australia. Newer infill housing of a similar period exists in pockets around Bramhall, as well as some more recent additions.

==Education==
Bramhall has five primary schools: Ladybrook, Moss Hey, Nevill Road, Pownall Green and Queensgate. Bramhall High School is the local secondary school.

<doc id="711966" wikidata="Q3063659" url="?curid=711966" title="Fabien Roy">
<text>Fabien Roy (; April 17, 1928 – October 31, 2023) was a Canadian politician who was active in Quebec in the 1970s. Roy was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec and the House of Commons of Canada, and advocated social credit theories of monetary reform.

==Background==
Fabien Roy was born in Saint-Prosper, Quebec. He studied accounting, sales management, and human resources in the Saint-Georges seminary, and commercial law, political economy and business administration at Université Laval. In 1980, following his departure from politics, he studied property valuation.

Roy was an accountant for the Saint-Prosper agricultural co-operative from 1945 to 1949, and secretary of the Federation of Co-operative Trucking (Quebec South district) from 1949 to 1952, and for the Sherbrooke district from 1952 to 1953. He founded the F. Roy Transports trucking company, which he ran from 1953 to 1962.

From 1962 to 1970, he was Director-General of a credit union in La Chaudière, and member of the administrative and executive councils of a Quebec credit union federation (Fédération des caisses d&#x27;établissement du Québec) from 1968 to 1970. In 1970, he was director of recruitment and sales for the federation. In 1960, he co-founded the Saint-Prosper Chamber of Commerce, and became president in 1963.

==Social Credit activist==
From 1962 to 1968, he was president of the Dorchester riding federal Ralliement créditiste association, and regional organizer for the party in the 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1968 federal elections.

From 1964 to 1965, he was provincial vice-president of the party.

==Member of the legislature==
Roy was elected to the Quebec National Assembly for Beauce riding in 1970, and held the post of chief whip of the Ralliement créditiste du Québec caucus from 1970 to 1972.

From 1972 to 1975, he was parliamentary leader of the party, and lost a bid to become leader at a February 1973 leadership convention. In the 1973 provincial election, he was returned to the National Assembly for the riding of Beauce-Sud.

Roy was president of the party from 1973 to 1974, but was expelled on November 3, 1975. He founded the Parti national populaire with former Liberal cabinet minister Jérôme Choquette on December 14, 1975, and was re-elected in the 1976 provincial election as the only PNP Member of the National Assembly.

==Federal politics==
Roy was appointed leader of the federal Social Credit Party of Canada on March 30, 1979, and resigned his National Assembly seat on April 5, 1979.

Social Credit attempted to rally the separatist and nationalist vote: Canadian flags were absent at its campaign kick-off rally, and the party&#x27;s slogan was &quot;C&#x27;est à notre tour&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s our turn&quot;), which was reminiscent of the popular separatist anthem &quot;Gens du pays&quot; that includes the chorus, &quot;C&#x27;est à votre tour de vous laisser parler d&#x27;amour&quot; (It&#x27;s your turn to talk about love). The party focused its platform on constitutional change, promising to fight to abolish the federal government&#x27;s rarely used right to disallow any provincial legislation, and stating that each province has a &quot;right to choose its own destiny within Canada&quot;. Despite these attempts to win nationalist and separatist votes, the party was reduced to six seats in the 1979 federal election. Roy himself was elected from Beauce in eastern Quebec.

While his party provided some support to the minority Progressive Conservative Party of Canada government, Prime Minister Joe Clark was unwilling to reciprocate. He refused to recognize the Socreds as an official party (they had half the seats required for official status in the Commons) or form a coalition with them. When the PC government presented its December budget which included a controversial gas tax opposed by the Liberals and NDP, the Socreds demanded that the gas tax revenues be allocated to Quebec which Clark turned down. In reaction, when the NDP attached a rider to the budget bill declaring that &quot;this House has lost confidence in the government,&quot; the Socred caucus abstained on the vote to adopt the amendment, which led to the defeat of the Clark government and an election on February 18, 1980.

The abstention by Social Credit on this important vote contributed to the growing perception that the party had become irrelevant following the death of iconic leader Réal Caouette four years earlier. Roy and all other Socred candidates were defeated in the 1980 federal election. The death of the Social Credit candidate in the riding of Frontenac, Quebec resulted in the postponement of the election in that riding to March 24. Roy sought to return to the House of Commons in the by-election, but lost to the Liberal candidate. Social Credit would never come within sight of winning a seat in the Commons again. Roy resigned from the leadership on November 1, 1980.

==Retirement==
Roy returned to business and community involvement, serving as director of Geoffrion Leclerc from 1981 to 1988, director of a community college (Cégep de Lévis-Lauzon) from 1984 to 1985, member of the Beauce economic council from 1981, as well as participating in Rotary Club activities and local celebrations. In 1987 he was one of the co-chairs of the 250th anniversary of the Beauce. He continued to campaign in many socio-economic organizations. He sat on the consultation committee of the Marius-Barbeau Museum.

In 1989, Fabien Roy became the founding president of the Village des défricheurs of Saint-Prosper.

Roy published his autobiography (&quot;Député à Québec et à Ottawa—mais toujours Beauceron !&quot;, ) in 2005.

==Personal life and death==
On August 27, 1960, he married Pauline Lessard Eudore in the parish Assumption, Saint-Georges-de-Beauce. The couple had four children together.

Fabien Roy died in Saint-Georges, Quebec, on October 31, 2023, at the age of 95.

<doc id="711969" wikidata="Q1973089" url="?curid=711969" title="High Hoyland">
<text>High Hoyland is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with West Yorkshire. It lies to the west of Kexbrough, and is located at approximately , at an elevation of around 200 metres above sea level. At the 2001 census it had a population of 142, reducing to 128 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
There is some evidence to suggest that &quot;High Hoyland&quot; has quite an ancient history, though no archaeological survey has yet taken place. Some people believe the village may have been the site of an Iron Age hill fort, and its strategic hilltop location would surely have been a good place for one. Nearby Kexbrough (originally &quot;Cezeburgh&quot;) also lends weight to the theory, since the &quot;burghs&quot; were originally strongholds.

The village was nevertheless in existence in 1086 when the Domesday survey was compiled. The village was listed as &quot;Heyholand&quot;, being one of only 16 settlements in present-day South Yorkshire to be recorded.

Today a bridleway runs along the ridge above the village; originally this was a trans-Pennine salt track, and was also mentioned in the Domesday survey.

==Present day==
The village is now part of Barnsley&#x27;s metropolitan area, yet retains a very rural feel and has become part of the commuter belt west of Barnsley, which also includes Silkstone and Cawthorne. The &quot;Cherry Tree Public House&quot; is one of the most famous in South Yorkshire, and has won awards for both its ale and its views - with spectacular open vistas across the valley. From here it is possible to see Cannon Hall, the Peak District National Park, Barnsley Town Hall and on clear days the cooling towers of the distant power stations of Drax and Eggborough.

<doc id="711970" wikidata="Q2574548" url="?curid=711970" title="Thoroughly Modern Millie">
<text>Thoroughly Modern Millie is a 1967 American musical romantic comedy film directed by George Roy Hill and starring Julie Andrews. The screenplay by Richard Morris, based on the 1956 British musical &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, follows a naïve young woman who finds herself in a series of madcap adventures when she sets her sights on marrying her wealthy boss. The film also stars Mary Tyler Moore, Carol Channing, James Fox, John Gavin, and Beatrice Lillie.

The soundtrack interpolates new songs by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn (&quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, &quot;The Tapioca&quot;), and Jay Thompson (&quot;Jimmy&quot;) with standard songs from the 1910s and 1920s, including &quot;Baby Face&quot; and &quot;Jazz Baby&quot;. For use of the latter, the producers had to acquire the rights from General Mills, which had used the melody with various lyrics to promote Wheaties for more than 40 years.

The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and five Golden Globe Awards. It became the eighth highest-grossing film of 1967 in North America. In 2000, it was adapted into a stage musical of the same name.

==Plot==
In 1922 New York City, flapper Millie Dillmount is determined to find work as a stenographer to a wealthy businessman and then marry him—a &quot;thoroughly modern&quot; goal. Millie befriends the sweet yet naive Miss Dorothy Brown as the latter checks into the Priscilla Hotel. When housemother Mrs. Meers learns that Miss Dorothy is an orphan, she remarks, &quot;Sad to be all alone in the world.&quot; Unbeknownst to Millie, Mrs. Meers is selling her tenants into sexual slavery, and those without family or close friends are her primary targets.

At a Friendship Dance in the dining hall, Millie meets devil-may-care paper clip salesman Jimmy Smith, to whom she takes an instant liking. However, she carries on with her plan to work for and then marry a rich man, and when she lands a job at Sincere Trust, she sets her sights on the attractive but self-absorbed Trevor Graydon. Jimmy later takes her and Miss Dorothy on an outing to Long Island, where they meet eccentric widow Muzzy Van Hossmere. Jimmy tells the girls that his father was Muzzy&#x27;s former gardener. Millie begins to fall for Jimmy, but she sees him summon Miss Dorothy from her room for a late-night rendezvous, and assumes the worst.

Millie is even more determined to stick to her plan and marry Trevor. One morning, she goes to work dressed as a flapper and attempts to seduce him, but her effort fails. Eventually, Trevor meets Miss Dorothy and falls in love with her, and vice versa, leaving Millie heartbroken. Meanwhile, Jimmy&#x27;s attempts to talk to Millie are continually thwarted by no-nonsense head stenographer Miss Flannary. He eventually climbs up the side of the building and when he finally manages to talk to Millie, she tells him that she is quitting her job as Mr. Graydon is no longer available.

Mrs. Meers makes several attempts to kidnap Miss Dorothy and hand her over to her Chinese henchmen Bun Foo and Ching Ho, but Millie unwittingly disrupts her every time. When Mrs. Meers finally succeeds, Millie finds Trevor drowning his sorrows, and he tells her that Miss Dorothy stood him up and checked out of the hotel. Jimmy climbs into Miss Dorothy&#x27;s room, lets Millie in, and they find all of Miss Dorothy&#x27;s possessions still there. Millie realizes that Miss Dorothy is just one of several girls who have vanished without a word to anyone, except to Mrs. Meers. Together with Trevor Graydon, they try to piece the puzzle together. When Jimmy asks what all the missing girls had in common, Millie mentions that they were all orphans.

Jimmy disguises himself as a woman named Mary James seeking accommodations at the Priscilla Hotel, and &quot;casually&quot; mentions to Mrs. Meers that she is an orphan. Mrs. Meers spots Trevor sitting in his car in front of the hotel, becomes suspicious, and shoots him with a tranquilizer dart. Mary James is subsequently captured by Mrs. Meers and her henchmen, and Millie follows them to Chinatown, where the unconscious Jimmy has been hidden in a room in a fireworks factory where Miss Dorothy is sleeping. Trying to look casual, Millie smokes a cigarette outside the building, and when she begins to choke on it, she tosses it into a window, setting off the fireworks. As a series of explosions tear through the building, Millie dashes into the factory and finds several girls tied up, about to be sent off to Beijing. She unties a couple of them, who then free the others, and then bumps into Miss Dorothy. They carry Jimmy out of the building and head for Muzzy&#x27;s mansion in Long Island.

Mrs. Meers, Bun Foo, and Ching Ho follow Millie and the gang, but under Muzzy&#x27;s leadership, everyone manages to subdue the nefarious trio. Millie then discovers that Jimmy (whose real name is James Van Hossmere) and Miss Dorothy are actually millionaire siblings and that Muzzy is their stepmother who sent them out into the world to find partners who would love them for who they were and not for their money. After consulting with a Chinese soothsayer, Millie marries Jimmy, Miss Dorothy marries Trevor, and Muzzy marries one of her instructors.

==Cast==
Jimmy Bryant provides the singing voice of Jimmy Smith/James Van Hossmere.

==Production==
Ross Hunter wanted to make a film of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, which had been a success on stage with Julie Andrews. Film rights cost too much—$400,000—so Hunter decided to do &quot;his own&quot;. He managed to get Andrews to agree to star.

Although Pat Morita and Jack Soo each play Chinese henchmen, both were of Japanese descent; Morita was born in California, and Soo was born on a ship in the Pacific Ocean headed to the United States. While he received no screen credit, Jimmy Bryant provided the singing voice for James Fox in this film.

According to Andrews, the film&#x27;s producers at Universal sought to maximize financial returns by having a roadshow theatrical release and refused to make the artistic cuts desired by director Hill, causing Hill to quit before the film was scored and finished.

==Music==
Elmer Bernstein composed the incidental score, for which he won his only Academy Award. The songs were arranged and conducted by André Previn.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $8.5 million in rentals in North America during 1967. At this time, Julie Andrews was the number-one box office star in motion pictures. &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; was her last hit film of the 1960s. Her next two films, &quot;Star!&quot; (1968) and &quot;Darling Lili&quot; (1970), were financial failures. Andrews did not star in another film until 1974 when she co-starred with Omar Sharif in &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot;.

===Critical response===
The film opened to good reviews and good box office. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a thoroughly delightful movie,&quot; &quot;a kidding satire, in a rollicking song-and-dance vein,&quot; &quot;a joyously syncopated frolic,&quot; and &quot;a romantic-melodramatic fable that makes clichés sparkle like jewels.&quot; He added, &quot;Miss Andrews is absolutely darling – deliciously spirited and dry ... Having had previous experience at this sort of Jazz-age hyperbole in the British musical, &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; ... she knows how to hit the right expressions of maidenly surprise and dismay, the right taps in a flow of nimble dances, and the right notes in a flood of icky songs.&quot; He concluded &quot;A few faults? Yes. There is an insertion of a Jewish wedding scene ... which is phony and gratuitous. There&#x27;s a melodramatic mishmash towards the end, which has Mr. Fox dressing up like a girl and acting kittenish. That is tasteless and humorless. And the whole thing&#x27;s too long. If they&#x27;ll just cut out some of those needless things, all the faults will be corrected and it&#x27;ll be a joy all the way.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; observed &quot;The first half of is quite successful in striking and maintaining a gay spirit and pace. There are many recognizable and beguiling satirical recalls of the flapper age and some quite funny bits. Liberties taken with reality, not to mention period, in the first half are redeemed by wit and characterization. But the sudden thrusting of the hero ... into a skyscraper-climbing, flagpole-hanging acrobat, a la Harold Lloyd, has little of Lloyd but the myth. This sequence is forced all the way.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;at its best a fresh-as-paint, cute-as-bees-knees, just swell enchantment&quot; with Andrews &quot;altogether superb,&quot; though he found the dance numbers &quot;strangely uninspired&quot; and that the second half suffered from &quot;a slapstick but singularly uncomical chase.&quot;

Clifford Terry of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;for the first 90 minutes, &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; is really swell, a pip, a humdinger, the bee&#x27;s knees, a doozy. And that&#x27;s no raspberries. Spoofing the Fitzgerald folks of the 1920s, the musical comedy bounces and bubbles along as a snappy send-up of the days of roadster ramble seats, Tapioca dances, and unflappable flappers with turned-down hose and turned-on beaux who sometimes were &#x27;fresh as paint&#x27;. Unfortunately, &quot;Millie&quot; is not an hour-and-a-half movie, and its final 50 minutes only demonstrate that what can start out as the berries, can finish up as a lemon.&quot;

Leo Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Highly insignificant and deliberately old-fashioned, the film veers and comments in a broadly stylized way ... All [Ross Hunter] may have produced is a commercial movie but enhancing the entire film is his own personal enthusiasm. He seems to be saying this is the way it was and yipes, wasn&#x27;t it delightful. It was and is.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;An exploitative film in the sense that it exploits its stars&#x27; previous successes as much as their actual talents or the merits of its own script, it nonetheless manages, like the best camp, to make a merit of its defects and to turn the comic-caption corn of its dialogue into a positive attribute.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film a perfect four stars in his original review, a decision he later admitted in hindsight he was &quot;no longer certain about.&quot;

TV Guide rated the film three out of four stars and commented &quot;Although it ultimately runs out of steam, this charming spoof of the 1920s is still one of the 1960s&#x27; better musicals ... Andrews is a comic delight, Moore is charming, and Channing steals scene after scene in this enjoyable feature.&quot; The film was one of four nostalgia-based films that George Roy Hill made. After &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, he made &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot;, and the Oscar-winning &quot;The Sting&quot;.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 85% based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.

<text>The Mitchel Athletic Complex is part of the Mitchel Field complex, located in Uniondale, New York, on the site of the decommissioned Mitchel Air Force Base. The facility is owned by Nassau County. It is used mostly for football and soccer and also sometimes for athletics. The athletic complex was built in 1984 and was renovated in 1997; it hosted track and field and soccer events during the 1998 Goodwill Games. Mitchel Field is also home to Nassau Coliseum, Nassau Community College, Hofstra University, Lockheed Corporation, and the Cradle of Aviation Museum.

In 2000, the Mitchel Athletic Complex hosted two matches of the 2000 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. A third round match between the Tampa Bay Mutiny and the MetroStars, now the New York Red Bulls, of Major League Soccer and a semi-final match between the Miami Fusion and the MetroStars with the MetroStars falling in the semi-final. In 2002, the Complex hosted a quarter-final match of the 2002 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup between the Columbus Crew and the MetroStars.

Mitchel Athletic Complex (also called Mitchel Park and Mitchel Field) was the home to the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse. The 2003 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game was held at Mitchel. It was also home to the New York Power of the former Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association. The soccer club Long Island Rough Riders also used the Mitchel Athletic Complex Stadium for home games. The current seating capacity is 10,102.

One of the hangars of the Complex was the practice facility for the New York Dragons of the Arena Football League. The team played their games at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, on another part of Mitchel Field.

In 2013, the New York Cosmos opened a new practice facility for the team with remodeled soccer fields within the large site, and in 2019 the club announced that they would play their regular-season games at the complex.

<text>Risotto ( , ; from , &#x27;rice&#x27;) is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and Parmesan cheese. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy. Saffron was originally used for flavour and its signature yellow colour.

Risotto in Italy is often a first course (), served before a second course (), but is often served with as a one-course meal.

==History==

Rice has been grown in southern Italy for centuries, and gradually made its way to northern Italy, where the marshes of the Po Valley were suitable for rice cultivation. According to a legend, a young glassblower&#x27;s apprentice of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano from Flanders, who used to use saffron as a pigment, added it to a rice dish at a wedding feast. Risotto is believed to have originated in what is now known as Lombardy. The first recipe identifiable as risotto dates from 1809. It includes rice sautéed in butter, sausages, bone marrow, and onions with broth with saffron gradually added. There is a recipe for a dish named as a risotto in the 1854 (&quot;Treatise on Cooking&quot;) by Giovanni Vialardi, assistant chief cook to kings. However, who invented risotto in Milan cannot be stated with certainty.

The rice varieties associated with risotto were developed in the 20th century, starting with Maratelli in 1914.

==Rice varieties==

A high-starch, round, medium- or short- grain white rice is usually used for making risotto. Such rices can absorb liquids and release starch, so they are stickier than the long grain varieties. The principal varieties used in Italy are Arborio, Baldo, Carnaroli, Maratelli, Padano, Roma, and Vialone Nano. Carnaroli, Maratelli (historical Italian variety), and Vialone Nano are considered to be the best (and most expensive) varieties, with different users preferring one over another. They have slightly different properties. For example, Carnaroli is less likely than Vialone Nano to get overcooked, but the latter, being smaller, cooks faster and absorbs condiments better. Other varieties such as Baldo, Originario, Ribe, and Roma may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish; these varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes and sweet rice desserts. Rice designations of , , and refer to the grains&#x27; size and shape (specifically the length and the narrowness) and not the quality.

==Basic preparation==
There are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety, cooked in a standard procedure. Risotto, unlike other rice dishes, requires constant care and attention. The rice is not to be pre-rinsed, boiled, or drained, as washing would remove much of the starch required for a creamy texture.

The rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of fat, called ; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed, the heat is raised to medium–high, and boiling stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring constantly. The constant stirring, with only a small amount of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for , vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of grated Parmesan cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.

Properly cooked risotto is rich and creamy, even if no cream is added, due to the starch in the grains. It has some resistance or bite (al dente) and separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or (&#x27;wavy&#x27; or &#x27;flowing in waves&#x27;). It is served on flat dishes and should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter.

<text>Wolfgang Ketterle (; born 21 October 1957) is a German physicist and professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His research has focused on experiments that trap and cool atoms to temperatures close to absolute zero, and he led one of the first groups to realize Bose–Einstein condensation in these systems in 1995. For this achievement, as well as early fundamental studies of condensates, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001, together with Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman.

==Biography==
Ketterle was born in Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, and attended school in Eppelheim and Heidelberg. In 1976 he entered the University of Heidelberg, before transferring to the Technical University of Munich two years later, where he gained the equivalent of his master&#x27;s diploma in 1982. In 1986 he earned a PhD in experimental molecular spectroscopy under the supervision of Herbert Walther and Hartmut Figger at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching, before conducting postdoctoral research at Garching and the University of Heidelberg. In 1990 he joined the group of David E. Pritchard in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT (RLE). He was appointed to the MIT physics faculty in 1993 and, since 1998, he has been John D. MacArthur Professor of Physics. In 2006, he was appointed Associate Director of RLE and began serving as director of MIT&#x27;s Center for Ultracold Atoms.

After achieving Bose–Einstein condensation in dilute gases in 1995, his group was in 1997 able to demonstrate interference between two colliding condensates, as well as the first realization of an &quot;atom laser&quot;, the atomic analogue of an optical laser. In addition to ongoing investigations of Bose–Einstein condensates in ultracold atoms, his more recent achievements have included the creation of a molecular Bose condensate in 2003, as well as a 2005 experiment providing evidence for &quot;high-temperature&quot; superfluidity in a fermionic condensate.

Ketterle is also a runner, and was featured in the December 2009 issue of Runner&#x27;s World&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Runner&quot;. Ketterle spoke of taking his running shoes to Stockholm when he received the Nobel Prize and happily running in the early dusk. Ketterle completed the 2013 Boston Marathon with a time of 2:49:16, and in 2014, in Boston, ran a personal record of 2:44:06.

Ketterle serves on the board of trustees of the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE), and participates in the Distinguished Lecture Series of CEE&#x27;s flagship program for high-school students, the Research Science Institute (RSI), which Ketterle&#x27;s own son Jonas attended in 2003. Ketterle sits on the International Scientific Advisory Committee of Australia&#x27;s ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies.

Ketterle is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

==Personal life==
Ketterle has been married to Michèle Plott since 2011. He has five children, three with Gabriele Ketterle, to whom he was married from 1985 to 2001.

<doc id="711995" wikidata="Q2261880" url="?curid=711995" title="Sea Island, Georgia">
<text>Sea Island is a privately-owned, seaside resort island in Glynn County, Georgia, part of the Golden Isles of Georgia, which include St. Simons Island, Jekyll Island, Little St. Simons Island, and the mainland city of Brunswick. Since 2016, Sea Island has been owned by the Broadmoor-Sea Island Company, a subsidiary of the Anschutz Corporation. The island is located along the Atlantic Coast just east of St. Simons Island. It lies about north of Jacksonville, Florida, and about south of Savannah, Georgia, and is reachable via a causeway from St. Simons Island. The Anschutz family of Denver, Colorado, owns two resorts with limited public access and maintains a gated community for around 500 single-family residences.

The resorts, Sea Island Beach Club and The Cloister, are located a short distance from one another, connected by a roundabout in the middle of Sea Island Drive, the island&#x27;s main connecting road. The oceanfront Beach Club contains restaurants, a game room, a bowling alley, an ice cream shop, a bar, and three pools. Sea Island&#x27;s main hotel, The Cloister, is located on its southwestern side along the Black Banks River. It includes restaurants, 200 rooms, a spa, tennis and squash courts, an exercise facility, and is home to the only Forbes Five Star restaurant in the state of Georgia, The Georgian Rooms. It is the only resort in the world to have received four Forbes Five-Star awards for fifteen consecutive years.

Georgia&#x27;s Sea Island is part of a long chain of barrier islands, also known as the &quot;Sea Islands&quot;, located along the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and northern Florida between the Santee and St. Johns rivers.

==History==

Like many of the easternmost barrier islands of Georgia, Sea Island was formed about 5,000 years ago, after the last major ice age. Unlike the much older, Pleistocene-age islands just to its west, there is little information about early human activity on the island. Most of its recorded history dates from the beginning of the 20th century.

Its original English name was Fifth Creek Island. Its first known white settler was Captain James Mackay, who served under General Oglethorpe at Fort Frederica. Subsequent holders included a series of St. Simons Island plantation owners, who used the land primarily for grazing. In 1926, automobile magnate Howard Coffin added it to his other land purchases in coastal Georgia. Two years later, on the advice of friends who foresaw the potential in oceanfront properties, he opened the Cloister Hotel that was nicknamed the &quot;Little Friendly Hotel&quot; and turned over its management to his cousin, Alfred W. Jones. Upon Howard Coffin&#x27;s death in 1937, A. W. Jones inherited the property, along with other tracts of nearby coastal land owned by the Sea Island Company.From its beginnings, the Cloister was a success, attracting a variety of &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; luminaries. When President Calvin Coolidge decided to spend his Christmas holidays on Sea Island in 1928, the new hotel gained national attention. Promoted as a quiet, worry-free escape, as opposed to some of the high-energy resorts in Florida, the Cloister appealed to businessmen, politicians, and celebrities, including New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, Edsel Ford, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Eddie Rickenbacker, and many others. In addition to the hotel, Mr. Coffin also dreamed of creating a residential community on the island and encouraged his guests to consider building &quot;cottages&quot; nearby. To that end, he brought in electricity, water and telephone service, and improved causeway access to both St. Simons and Sea Islands. Among those building homes was Eugene O&#x27;Neill, who wrote the play &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; while there.

Although growth slowed during the Great Depression, the still modest resort was able to make it through the financial crisis and World War II. In the postwar years, the Cloister and its surrounding community grew slowly, with the hotel welcoming a steady stream of distinguished guests, including U.S. presidents Hoover, Eisenhower, Ford and Carter. In 1949, Sarah Churchill married photographer Anthony Beauchamp on the island. Among the thousands of honeymooners to visit were George and Barbara Bush. The island&#x27;s residential community also grew in numbers and in stature, with some lot prices pushing into the millions of dollars by the end of the 20th century.

===21st century===
In 2003, The Lodge was built on St. Simons Island with the help of Bill Jones. The Lodge became a hub for golfers and yet another accommodation under the Sea Island umbrella. By 2003, A. W. &quot;Bill&quot; Jones III decided it was time for a complete reconstruction of the Cloister. The historic original building lacked a proper foundation and did not meet modern building codes, so it was completely demolished and replaced, over a three-year period, with a new, luxurious, much larger structure inspired by the original. Upgrades were also made to the resort&#x27;s beach club and spa.

Just two years after its grand re-opening, the financial panic of 2008 and the subsequent Great Recession hit the Sea Island Company from several directions. Expected property sales in a new, upscale development did not occur. Resort visitation declined. New home purchases in the surrounding community stalled. Revenue from the Cloister dropped by 31% from 2007 to 2009. As a result, and despite winning 5-star travel guide awards the company defaulted on its loans which were later found to have been ill-advised from the start and about 25% of its workforce was laid off. Although two major creditors, Synovus and Bank of America agreed to a restructured loan package in 2009, Sea Island Company was unable to sell off enough of its land holdings, and again defaulted in 2010. Later that year, the company filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, and was acquired by a consortium of investors who formed Sea Island Acquisitions, LLC, to manage the property and turn its business around.
In April 2016, Sea Island Acquisitions completed a $40 million expansion that added a new &quot;Garden Wing&quot; to the Cloister with 63 rooms. In June 2016, the Anschutz family of Denver, Colorado, headed by Philip Anschutz, bought out the other three investors to become the sole owner of Sea Island Company.

== Commemorative live oaks ==
While visiting Sea Island in 1928, President Calvin Coolidge planted a live oak to commemorate the occasion. The planting became a tradition observed by a succession of distinguished guests including presidents and heads of state. In addition to President Coolidge, those who personally planted trees included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, President George H. W. Bush, Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, and President Bill Clinton. During the G8 conference in 2004, President George W. Bush planted a tree.

Only one of the commemorative trees is not a live oak. In 1931, Howard Coffin planted an English oak acorn from General Oglethorpe&#x27;s estate in England, to honor the founder of the Georgia colony.

==2004 G8 summit==
From June 8–10, 2004, President George W. Bush chose to host a summit of the Group of Eight leaders at Sea Island. Present at the summit were Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada, President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi of Japan, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom. Also in attendance were European Union Commission President Romano Prodi and several other invited heads of state.

Sea Island was selected for the summit in part because its relative isolation facilitated the extensive security arrangements necessary for such a gathering. As part of the security measures, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated the summit a National Special Security Event (NSSE).

Access to the island was tightly controlled, and press headquarters (the International Media Center) was located in Savannah, Georgia, some to the north. Protesters and demonstrations were marginalized, in part because the conference venue was located in a nearly inaccessible place.

The leaders and other summit participants discussed issues faced by developing countries in Africa and elsewhere, ranging from peacekeeping operations, HIV/AIDS vaccine development, famine relief, debt reduction, and the eradication of polio.

==Golf==

A significant portion of Sea Island&#x27;s culture and economy revolves around golf. In 1928, two years after Sea Island Company founder Howard Coffin purchased Retreat Plantation, the first nine-hole course was completed and fittingly named Plantation. The next year the second nine, Seaside, was established. In the near future golf legends such as Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen, and Sam Snead all ventured to Sea Island to play the courses. The first tournament played in the area was the Sea Island Ladies Open Invitational in 1954, which was won by World Golf Hall of Famer Louise Suggs. Over time, the third resort course, Retreat, and two non-resort affiliated courses, Frederica Golf Club and Ocean Forest Golf Club, were also founded on the island.

In 2001, the scope of golf in Sea Island expanded greatly and golf became the centerpiece that it is today in the area. The creation of the Lodge at Sea Island has allowed golfers to stay on the golf course property. Two premier amateur golf tournaments were played at Ocean Forest Golf Club. The Walker Cup, one of the most prestigious amateur events throughout the world, was held in August 2001 and even featured an opening ceremony headlined by President George H. W. Bush. The second tournament held at Ocean Forest was the inaugural Jones Cup Invitational, named after the club&#x27;s founding family. Since then, the Jones Cup has been played every year at Ocean Forest, and in 2009 the Jones Cup Junior Invitational was created and held at the Seaside course. Both of these events attract golfers from across the country to compete in very exclusive tournaments at extremely challenging venues.

The following year, the largest tournament that is played in Sea Island was founded. The PGA Tour, with the help of host and Sea Island native Davis Love III, held the first ever McGladrey Classic (now the RSM Classic) on both the Plantation and Seaside courses. The Sea Island community has benefited greatly from this event, through increased exposure and the yearly contributions the Davis Love Foundation raises throughout the tournament week. This tournament has helped attract individuals to travel to or live in Sea Island, which has helped grow the economy in the area and led to the expansion of the resort.

<doc id="711996" wikidata="Q1355665" url="?curid=711996" title="Concentrate">
<text>A concentrate is a form of substance that has had the majority of its diluting agent or diluent (in the case of a liquid: the solvent) removed, such that the substance becomes the majority of the composition. Typically, this will be the removal of water from a solution or suspension, such as the removal of water from fruit juice.

== Food ==

===Juice concentrate===
A juice concentrate is the result of removing water from fruit or vegetable juice. In juice manufacturing from concentrate, numerous procedures are required under government regulation to ensure food safety.

A process of concentrating orange juice was patented in 1948. It was originally developed to provide World War II troops with a reliable source of vitamin C.

===Soft drink concentrate===
Most sodas and soft drinks are produced as highly concentrated syrups and later diluted with carbonated water directly before consumption or bottling. Such concentrated syrups are sometimes retailed to the end-consumer because of their relatively low price and considerable weight savings.

Most juice and soda concentrates have a long shelf-life due to high sugar content and/or added preservatives.

===Other food===
Condensed milk is also produced for transport weight savings and resistance to spoilage.
===Applications in the Food Industry===
Dairy Products discuss the use of concentrates in dairy, such as condensed milk, which involves reducing water content for preservation and transport efficiency.

Flavor Enhancers include information on how concentrates, like vanilla or fruit extracts, are used to intensify flavors in various culinary applications.

<doc id="711997" wikidata="Q1201935" url="?curid=711997" title="2012 transit of Venus">
<text>The 2012 transit of Venus, when the planet Venus appeared as a small, dark spot passing across the face of the Sun, began at 22:09 UTC on 5 June 2012, and finished at 04:49 UTC on 6 June. Depending on the position of the observer, the exact times varied by up to ±7 minutes. Transits of Venus are among the rarest of predictable celestial phenomena and occur in pairs. Consecutive transits per pair are spaced 8 years apart, and consecutive pairs occur more than a century apart: The previous transit of Venus took place on 8 June 2004 (preceded by transits on 9 December 1874 and 6 December 1882); the next pair of transits will occur on 10–11 December 2117 and December 2125 within the 22nd century.

==Observations of the event==

The entire transit was visible from the western Pacific Ocean, northwesternmost North America, northeastern Asia, Japan, the Philippines, eastern Australia, New Zealand, and high Arctic locations including northernmost Scandinavia, and Greenland. In North America, the Caribbean, and northwestern South America, the beginning of the transit was visible on 5 June until sunset. From sunrise on 6 June, the end of the transit was visible from South Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and most of Europe. The phenomenon was not visible from most of South America, nor from western Africa. There were a number of live online video streams with footage from telescopes around the world. Midway through the transit one of the NASA streams had nearly 2 million total views and was getting roughly 90,000 viewers at any given moment.

In Los Angeles, crowds jammed Mount Hollywood where the Griffith Observatory set up telescopes for the public to view the transit. In Hawaii, hundreds of tourists watched the event on Waikiki Beach where the University of Hawaii set up eight telescopes and two large screens showing webcasts of the transit. The transit was also observed and historically photographed by NASA astronaut Don Pettit aboard the International Space Station.

NASA&#x27;s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory could not see the transit as it was not in between the Earth and the Sun at the time of the event, but high-definition images of the event were obtained by Solar Dynamics Observatory, from above the Earth. Agency astrophysicist Dr. Lika Guhathakurta said, &quot;We get to see Venus in exquisite detail because of SDO&#x27;s spatial resolution, SDO is a very special observatory. It takes images that are about 10 times better than a high-definition TV and those images are acquired at a temporal cadence of one every 10 seconds. This is something we&#x27;ve never had before&quot;.

==Research==
The 2012 transit gave scientists a number of research opportunities. These included:
*Measurement of dips in a star&#x27;s brightness caused by a known planet transiting a known star (the Sun). This will help astronomers when searching for exoplanets. Unlike the 2004 Venus transit, the 2012 transit occurred during an active phase of the 11-year activity cycle of the Sun, and would have provided practice in detecting a planet&#x27;s signal around a &quot;spotty&quot; variable star.
*Measurement of the apparent diameter of Venus during the transit, and comparison with its known diameter. This will have given information on how to estimate exoplanet sizes.
*The number of locations documenting the event will provide much data via parallax that will generate more accurate measurements.
*Observation of the atmosphere of Venus simultaneously from Earth-based telescopes and from the Venus Express spacecraft. This gave a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of Venus&#x27;s atmosphere than is possible from either viewpoint alone, and should provide new information about the climate of the planet.
*Spectrographic study of the atmosphere of Venus. The results of analysis of the well-understood atmosphere of Venus will be compared with studies of exoplanets with atmospheres that are unknown.
*The Hubble Space Telescope used the Moon as a mirror to study the light reflected from Venus to determine the makeup of its atmosphere. This may provide another technique to study exoplanets.
* Experimental reconstruction of Lomonosov&#x27;s discovery of Venusian atmosphere (1761) with antique refractors. The researchers observed the &quot;Lomonosov&#x27;s arc&quot; and other aureole effects due to Venus&#x27;s atmosphere and concluded that Lomonosov&#x27;s telescope was fully adequate to the task of detecting the arc of light around Venus off the Sun&#x27;s disc during ingress or egress if proper experimental techniques as described by Lomonosov in his 1761 paper are employed.

<text>Villanova Stadium is a 12,500 seat stadium located on the campus of Villanova University in Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA.

==History==
Villanova Stadium was originally built in 1927 and dedicated on October 8, 1927. The stadium plays host to a wide variety of events including serving as home to the Villanova Wildcats football, field hockey, lacrosse, and track and field teams. Philadelphia area teams such as the WUSA&#x27;s Philadelphia Charge and Major League Lacrosse&#x27;s Philadelphia Barrage have also used the stadium in the past or currently. In the 1960s, Monsignor Bonner High School, like Villanova an Augustinian school, used the field.

The field and track at Villanova Stadium are known as &quot;Goodreau Field&quot; and &quot;Jumbo Elliott Track,&quot; respectively. On May 7, 1930, the playing field at Villanova Stadium was dedicated to the memory of Leo J. Francis Goodreau, a Villanova football player who died due to injuries incurred in practice. On September 27, 1980, the running track was dedicated to Villanova&#x27;s legendary track and field coach James &quot;Jumbo&quot; Elliott.

===Renovations===
In Fall 1999, the stadium underwent a face-lift with the Stadium Renovation Project. Included in this project was a state of the art press box, in addition to housing an 80-person meeting room for all Villanova Athletic Department personnel to use. The former AstroTurf playing field was replaced during the spring of 2002 with a synthetic grass surface known as AstroPlay.

In Fall 2009, the stadium received a new scoreboard along with a new playing surface.

In 2016, a new football operations building, the Andrew J. Talley Athletic Center, which also serves as the training room for the sports programs at the school, opened, named for the school&#x27;s first head coach since the May 1984 reinstatement of the program until the end of 2016.

<doc id="712013" wikidata="Q1921838" url="?curid=712013" title="Feature structure">
<text>In phrase structure grammars, such as generalised phrase structure grammar, head-driven phrase structure grammar and lexical functional grammar, a feature structure is essentially a set of attribute–value pairs. For example, the attribute named &quot;number&quot; might have the value &quot;singular&quot;. The value of an attribute may be either atomic, e.g. the symbol &quot;singular&quot;, or complex (most commonly a feature structure, but also a list or a set).

A feature structure can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with the nodes corresponding to the variable values and the paths to the variable names. Operations defined on feature structures, e.g. unification, are used extensively in phrase structure grammars. In most theories (e.g. HPSG), operations are strictly speaking defined over equations describing feature structures and not over feature structures themselves, though feature structures are usually used in informal exposition.

Often, feature structures are written like this:

formula_1

Here there are the two features &quot;category&quot; and &quot;agreement&quot;. &quot;Category&quot; has the value &quot;noun phrase&quot; whereas the value of &quot;agreement&quot; is indicated by another feature structure with the features &quot;number&quot; and &quot;person&quot; being &quot;singular&quot; and &quot;third&quot;.

This particular notation is called &quot;attribute value matrix&quot; (AVM).

The matrix has two columns, one for the feature names and the other for the values. In this sense a feature structure is a list of key-value pairs. The value might be atomic or another feature structure. This leads to another notation for feature structures: the use of trees. In fact, some systems (such as PATR-II) use S-expressions to represent feature structures.

<doc id="712021" wikidata="Q4972462" url="?curid=712021" title="Broadway Is My Beat">
<text>Broadway Is My Beat, a radio crime drama, ran on CBS from February 27, 1949 to August 1, 1954. 

==Characters and story==
The opening theme of &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Manhattan&quot; introduced Detective Danny Clover, a hardened New York City cop who worked homicide &quot;from Times Square to Columbus Circle—the gaudiest, the most violent, the lonesomest mile in the world.&quot;

Danny Clover narrated the tales of the Great White Way to the accompaniment of music by Wilbur Hatch and Alexander Courage, and the recreation of Manhattan&#x27;s aural tapestry required the talents of three sound effects technicians (David Light, Ralph Cummings, Ross Murray). Bill Anders was the show&#x27;s announcer, as was Joe Walters.

The supporting cast included regulars Charles Calvert (as Sgt. Gino Tartaglia) and Jack Kruschen (as Sgt. Muggavan), with episodic roles filled by television, radio, and film stars such as Eve McVeagh, and such radio actors as Irene Tedrow, Barney Phillips, Virginia Gregg, Anthony Barrett, Herb Butterfield, Lamont Johnson, Herb Ellis, Hy Averback, Edgar Barrier, Betty Lou Gerson, Cathy Lewis, Harry Bartell, Sheldon Leonard, Martha Wentworth, Lawrence Dobkin, Howard McNear, and Mary Jane Croft.

==Closing==

Time was elastic, a fairly easy trick in the theater of the mind. Stories closed, more often than not on a pensive, melancholy note, quickly after the climax of the program. Rarely was the case reviewed; more likely Clover would philosophize, as in the show&#x27;s opening, with a bit of prose that ran from purple to stunningly poignant, ending in a reprise of the show&#x27;s setup, e.g.:
== Production ==
With Anthony Ross portraying Times Square Detective Danny Clover, the show originated from New York City through May 29, 1949. Beginning on July 7, 1949, it originated from Hollywood. Ross ended his time with the program on June 23, 1950; Larry Thor began playing Clover on July 3, 1950.

The series featured music by Robert Stringer, and scripts by Peter Lyon. John Dietz directed for producer Lester Gottlieb (eventually succeeding him as producer). Bern Bennett was the original announcer.

When the series was broadcast from Hollywood, producer Elliott Lewis directed a new cast in scripts by Morton S. Fine and David Friedkin.

==Critical response==
A review in the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; called the program &quot;another whodunit with an incidental Gotham background that should appeal to the mystery fans.&quot; The review also mentioned &quot;smoothly meshing production gears, solid performances by an ace cast and some firstrate (sic) musical scoring by Robert Stringer.&quot;

<text>Heterobranchia, the heterobranchs (meaning &quot;different-gilled snails&quot;), is a taxonomic clade of snails and slugs, which includes marine, aquatic, and terrestrial gastropod molluscs.

Heterobranchia is one of the main clades of gastropods. Currently Heterobranchia comprises two groups: the opisthobranchs, and the pulmonates.

==Diversity ==

The two subdivisions of this large clade are quite diverse:

* Opisthobranchia are virtually all marine species, some shelled and some not, and comprise about 25 families and 2000 species of the bubble shells, the seaslugs, as well as the sea hares. The internal organs of the opisthobranchs have undergone detorsion (unwinding of the viscera that were twisted during torsion).
* The Pulmonata comprises about 20000 species, includes the majority of land snails and slugs, many freshwater snails, and a small number of marine species. The mantle cavity of the Pulmonata is modified into an air-breathing organ. They are also characterized by detorsion and a symmetrically-arranged nervous system. The pulmonates almost always lack an operculum and are hermaphroditic.
==Taxonomy ==
=== Current taxonomy ===

** Valvatoidea Gray, 1840
** Architectonicoidea Gray, 1850
** Mathildoidea Dall, 1889
** Omalogyroidea G. O. Sars, 1878
** Allomorpha

*** Ringipleura
**** Ringiculoidea Philippi, 1853
**** Nudipleura
*** Tectipleura
**** Euopistobranchia
**** Panpulmonata

=== Older taxonomy ===
The families currently included in Heterobranchia have historically been placed in many different parts of the taxonomic class of gastropods. Earlier authors (such as J.E. Gray, 1840) considered Heterobranchia to consist of only marine gastropods, and conceptualized it as a borderline category, intermediate between the Opisthobranchia &amp; Pulmonata, and all the other gastropods.

The (sometimes recognized) category Heterostropha within the Heterobranchia, which includes such families as Architectonicidae, the sundial or staircase snails, is primarily characterized by a shell which has a heterostrophic protoconch, in other words the apical whorls are coiled in the opposite plane to the adult whorls. The classification of this group was revised by Ponder &amp; Warén in 1988.

According to the older taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997) the Heterobranchia were ranked as a superorder.

=== 2005 taxonomy ===

Heterobranchia is currently one of the main clades of gastropods. For a detailed taxonomy, see Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005)#Clade Heterobranchia.

=== 2010 taxonomy ===
Jörger et al. (2010) have redefined major groups within the Heterobranchia: they created the new clades Euopisthobranchia and Panpulmonata.

<text>Forever Free is a science fiction novel by American author Joe Haldeman, the sequel to &quot;The Forever War&quot;. It was published in 1999.

==Plot summary==
William Mandella, protagonist of &quot;The Forever War&quot;, lives with his wife Marygay on the icy world Middle Finger, a planet of the Mizar system. Dissatisfied with the state of their society, they eventually decide to jump forward in time, using the time dilation of interstellar travel. Their intention is to travel for 10 subjective years, at relativistic speeds, into the future, during which 40,000 Earth years will have passed on Middle Finger. They, along with other Forever War veterans and other disenchanted humans on Middle Finger, hope that whatever they will find upon their return will be more to their liking. This requires the consent of the posthuman group mind now known as &#x27;Man&#x27;, and of the alien group mind Tauran race. When permission is denied, William and allies hijack the ship. One Man and one Tauran join the journey.

After Marygay and William head away from their planet, a series of unexplained occurrences happen and the ship starts to lose antimatter mysteriously. They abandon the ship and return home. Instead of the intended 40,000 years, they have only been away 24 Earth years. Upon arrival, they find the planet still intact, but seemingly vacant; everyone having literally disappeared at the same time as the incident on their ship. They then return to Earth, and realize that all other humans, Man and Taurans have disappeared, but robots and wildlife remain. 

On Earth, a shape-shifting being, an Omni, reveals itself. This being has been on Earth and the other inhabited planets for millennia and is not certain of its own origin. The Omni reveals that its race had given the humans and Taurans language and controlled their level of technology, but did not know what caused recent mass disappearances. The Omni and the lone surviving Tauran discuss the possibility of &#x27;nameless&#x27; beings causing the unexplainable phenomena. Meanwhile, more Omni appear, but some of the remaining humans and other Omni spontaneously explode inexplicably. The Omni conclude that William and Marygay provoked the &#x27;nameless&#x27; and must convince the &#x27;nameless&#x27; to leave the universe alone.

Then, the &#x27;nameless&#x27; appears—a god who evidently created the universe as an experiment to observe. The god compares the action of William&#x27;s group leaving the galaxy on a 40,000-year round-trip as similar to a laboratory mouse escaping its cage, prompting it to take drastic action. The god announces its control over physics, life, death, and ability to time travel. The god discusses timelines as not linear, but an infinite &quot;table&quot; of possible events, reveals the existence of other &quot;tables&quot;, but declines to answer if there is a higher power above them. The god declares this experiment &quot;over&quot;, declaring that it would leave for another galaxy and only return to observe resultant events in 1,000,000 years. The god departs, returning to life the exploded beings, and restoring the vanished beings, whom the god stored in stasis.

After the god&#x27;s departure, the Omni peacefully reveal themselves to humanity, Man and the Taurans, and all worked together to overcome the detrimental effects caused by the mass disappearance. Religion was strengthened due to proof of a god, while science required rechecking of fundamental laws and universal constants, with the god having altered the speed of light. William and Marygay return to live on Middle Finger, reuniting with their son Bill.

==Reception==
&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; reviewer Charles de Lint praised the novel, declaring &quot;&quot;Forever Free&quot; is everything good science fiction should be but so often isn&#x27;t: a grand adventure into what it means to be human, told through rich characterization and thoughtful scientific (not to mention religious) speculation that doesn&#x27;t lag for a moment.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; panned the book as a &quot;belated, and truly terrible, sequel&quot; to &quot;The Forever War&quot;.

<text>Birmingham, a city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands, England, is the second-largest city in the United Kingdom.

==Civic history==

Most of Birmingham was historically a part of Warwickshire, though the modern city also includes villages and towns historically in Staffordshire or Worcestershire.

Until the 1760s, Birmingham was administered by manorial and parish officials, most of whom served on a part-time and honorary basis. By the 1760s the population growth of Birmingham made this system completely inadequate, and salaried officials were needed. The Birmingham Improvement Act 1769 (9 Geo. 3. c. 83) created a body of &quot;Commissioners of the Streets&quot; who had powers to levy a rate for functions such as cleaning and street lighting. They were later given powers to provide policing and build public buildings.

The Reform Act 1832 gave Birmingham its first representation in Parliament initially with only two MPs but this has been gradually expanded.

Birmingham gained the status of a municipal borough in 1838 and gained its first elected town council which eventually took over the functions of the Street Commissioners. In 1889, it became a county borough (unitary authority) and a city. This remained unchanged until 1974 when Birmingham became a metropolitan district of the newly created West Midlands county under the West Midlands County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986 and Birmingham effectively reverted to being a unitary authority although sharing some services with other authorities in the county.

A Birmingham coat of arms was awarded to the corporation in 1889 and updated for the city council in 1977.

In the past, the council has been responsible for water, electricity and gas supply, further education colleges, public transport and local police and fire services. All are now in the hands of other public-or private-sector bodies.

===Expansion===
Birmingham&#x27;s boundaries were expanded at several times during the 19th and 20th centuries.

Birmingham was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1838. The borough initially included the parishes of Birmingham and Edgbaston and part of the parish of Aston. In 1889, the municipal borough of Birmingham was reconstituted as a county borough.

It was expanded in 1891 under the &quot;City of Birmingham Extension Order&quot; by adding Harborne from Staffordshire and Balsall Heath from Worcestershire, as well as Saltley, a further part of Aston parish. Quinton in Worcestershire was added in 1909.

===Greater Birmingham Scheme 1911===

1911 saw a large expansion under the &quot;Greater Birmingham Scheme&quot;, with the addition of Aston Manor and Erdington from Warwickshire, Handsworth from Staffordshire, and Yardley Rural District and the greater part of King&#x27;s Norton and Northfield from Worcestershire. Perry Barr in Staffordshire was added in 1928. In 1931, parts of the parishes of Minworth, Castle Bromwich, Sheldon and a tiny part of Solihull were added, including the area of Castle Vale, then known as Berwood.

Birmingham was reconstituted on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as a metropolitan district, which covered both the former county borough of Birmingham, and the municipal borough of Sutton Coldfield.

==Local government==

===Birmingham City Council===

Birmingham City Council is one of the largest local authorities in Europe with, following a reorganisation of boundaries in June 2004, 120 Birmingham City Councillors representing over one million people, in 40 wards. The council headquarters are at the Council House in the city centre. Birmingham City Council is responsible for running nearly all local services, with the exception of those run by joint boards as detailed below. The provision of certain services has in recent years been devolved to several Districts, which each have an area committee made up of councillors from that district.

===Council constituencies===
From 5 April 2004, responsibility and budgets for a number of services were devolved to 11 district committees, as part of a growing trend in the UK to use area committees for large councils. From 1 June 2006 the districts were reduced from 11 to 10 in order to correspond with the revised Westminster constituency boundaries, and renamed &quot;council constituencies&quot;. Each now comprises four wards. The council constituencies are:

*Edgbaston
*Erdington
*Hall Green
*Hodge Hill
*Ladywood
*Northfield
*Perry Barr
*Selly Oak
*Sutton Coldfield
*Yardley

===Parishes===
There are two civil parishes in Birmingham; New Frankley and Sutton Coldfield, apart from these, most of the city is unparished. New Frankley parish was established in 2000 in an area transferred from Bromsgrove in 1995, and which had previously been part of the Frankley parish. Sutton Coldfield used to be a town and parish in its own right until 1974, when it was absorbed into Birmingham; the new parish of Sutton Coldfield was established in 2015, when the Sutton Coldfield Town Council was first elected.

==Regional government==
Birmingham was the seat of regional government for the West Midlands region of England as the home of the region&#x27;s Government Office, the regional development agency Advantage West Midlands, and the West Midlands Regional Assembly.
Since 2011, Birmingham has formed part of the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership along with neighbouring authorities Bromsgrove, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Redditch, Solihull, Tamworth, Wyre Forest.

In November 2014, it was announced Birmingham was to create a combined authority with the four neighbouring boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Coventry and Solihull later joined, making the entire West Midlands county involved. The West Midlands Combined Authority was formed in April 2016 in a bid to gain greater devolved powers from the government. The post of Mayor of West Midlands was created the following year.

=== Joint county-wide services ===
Some local services which cover Birmingham are run jointly with the six other authorities in the West Midlands county. These county wide services are:

*West Midlands Police
*West Midlands Fire Service
*Transport for West Midlands, which oversees public transport.

==At Westminster==

Birmingham&#x27;s first two members of parliament were Thomas Attwood and Joshua Scholefield who were elected when the town was enfranchised in 1832, following the Great Reform Act.

Birmingham&#x27;s ten parliamentary constituencies are represented in the House of Commons by two Conservative and eight Labour MPs.

<text>Peter Andre (born Peter James Andrea; 27 February 1973) is a British-Australian singer, songwriter, and media personality.

Born in England to Cypriot parents and raised in Australia, Andre achieved success in the mid-1990s as a singer, topping the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Flava&quot; and &quot;I Feel You&quot; in 1996. After featuring in the third series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2004, he found renewed popularity and his 1995 hit &quot;Mysterious Girl&quot; reached No. 1 upon reissue. He has continued his career in music and television, notably competing in the thirteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (2015) and starring in the &quot;Katie &amp; Peter&quot; TV franchise (2004–2009) with his then-wife Katie Price, whom he met when both took part in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot;.

==Early life==
Andre was born Peter James Andrea on 27 February 1973 in the Harrow area of London, the son of Greek Cypriot parents. He was raised as one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses but is now lapsed. His brother, Andrew, died of kidney cancer at the age of 54 in December 2012. His other brother, Chris, is also a musician who continues to reside in Cyprus. At the age of six, Andre and his family relocated to Australia, where they lived in Sydney before settling on the Gold Coast when he was nine. At the age of 14, he finished in second place behind Wade Robson in a dancing competition in which the prize was to meet Michael Jackson. In 1989, 16-year-old Andre became a contestant on Australian talent show &quot;New Faces&quot;. As a result, he was offered a recording contract for $146,000. During this time, he lived in a beach-side apartment in Surfers Paradise and attended Benowa State High School on the Gold Coast.

== Music career ==

Andre was sent to the UK to work with producers Phil Harding and Ian Curnow at PWL Studios, where he recorded his debut single &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;, and his breakthrough hit, &quot;Gimme Little Sign&quot;. &quot;He was brilliant,&quot; recalled Curnow of the sessions, while Harding remembered, &quot;he was extremely enthusiastic and quite hard to control — but he was a good singer.&quot;

In 1992, Andre released &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;, which peaked at No. 72 on the Australian singles chart. However, it reached No.1 in the majority of Africa. &quot;Gimme Little Sign&quot; peaked at No. 3 and spent a total of 31 weeks in the charts. In 1993, Andre received an ARIA Award for highest-selling Australian single of the year. His second studio album was released on 30 September 1996, peaking at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. The album included the hit single &quot;Mysterious Girl&quot;, which peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1996, but reached number 1 on re-release in 2004, following Andre&#x27;s appearance in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; As a result, Andre returned to the UK in the mid-1990s.

On 14 September 2009, Peter released his sixth studio album, &quot;Revelation&quot;. Notable tracks &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and &quot;Unconditional&quot; peaked at 4th and 50th respectively in the UK charts, with the album reaching No. 3.

==Television==
During their marriage, Andre and Katie Price launched the &quot;Katie &amp; Peter&quot; franchise on ITV2, which documented their life together. The franchise included several fly-on-the-wall reality series which comprised &quot;When Jordan Met Peter&quot;, &quot;Jordan &amp; Peter: Laid Bare&quot; and &quot;Jordan &amp; Peter: Marriage and Mayhem&quot; (2004–05); &quot;Katie &amp; Peter: The Next Chapter&quot;, &quot;Katie &amp; Peter: The Baby Diaries&quot; and &quot;Katie &amp; Peter: Unleashed&quot; (2007); &quot;Katie &amp; Peter: Down Under&quot;; and &quot;Katie &amp; Peter: African Adventures&quot; (2008); and &quot;Katie &amp; Peter: Stateside&quot; in 2009. Their 2009 separation resulted in their individual series being recorded: &quot;Peter Andre: The Next Chapter&quot; continued on ITV2 until 2011, followed by &quot;Peter Andre: Here 2 Help&quot; (2011) and &quot;Peter Andre: My Life&quot; (2011–13).

In July 2010, Andre and Jason Manford were team captains on the ITV series &quot;Odd One In&quot;. In 2013, Andre was a guest judge on the ITV entertainment series &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot;, and later guest-presented five editions of &quot;Sunday Scoop&quot; on ITV. Since 11 November that year, Andre has presented &quot;60 Minute Makeover&quot;, which has been re-branded as &quot;Peter Andre&#x27;s 60 Minute Makeover&quot;.

In 2014, Andre released the song &quot;Kid&quot; (for the film &quot;Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman&quot;) which was the lead single from his album &quot;Big Night&quot;. On 8 October that same year, Andre co-hosted the ITVBe opener with Jamelia. In 2014, Andre became the new face to feature in supermarket Iceland&#x27;s television commercials.

Andre has since starred in the ITV weekly series &quot;Give a Pet a Home&quot; which works alongside the RSPCA in Birmingham.
In August 2015, he was announced as a contestant for the thirteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; which began a month later and in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara. They went out just before the quarter-final, in week 10, and therefore finished in seventh place.

In 2018, Andre voiced Ace the race car in the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; film &quot;Big World! Big Adventures!&quot;. He reprised the role for the show&#x27;s 24th season in 2020.

In December 2023, Andre joined the news channel GBNews. He began presenting the weekend show alongside Ellie Costello and is set to co-host the show throughout December.

==Personal life==

Andre began dating glamour model Katie Price after they met on reality series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in early 2004. They secretly got engaged that May, but it was not announced publicly until months later. They married on 10 September 2005 at Highclere Castle. They have two children together. While married to Price, Andre was stepfather to her son from her earlier relationship with footballer Dwight Yorke. They renewed their vows in September 2008, but it was announced in May 2009 that they had separated. They divorced in September of that year.

In July 2012, Andre began a relationship with Emily MacDonagh, a doctor who gave birth to Andre&#x27;s third child in 2014. They married in 2015 at Mamhead House. In 2016, they had a son together. In April 2024, they had another daughter together. They live in Surrey.

Being born to Greek Cypriot parents, Andre enjoys reconnecting with his roots and maintains a home in Kiti.

<text>The Sir George Williams affair (also referred to as &quot;The Sir George Williams Computer Centre Incident&quot;) was a 1969 event at Sir George Williams University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, now a part of Concordia University. It was the largest student occupation in Canadian history, and resulted in $2 million of property damage.

==Background==

In May 1968, six West Indian students of Sir George Williams University accused biology professor Perry Anderson of discrimination because of alleged unfair grading. No meetings were held to discuss the incident and to find a solution. Eight months later, students took matters into their own hands by organizing meetings, sit-ins and peaceful protests. Other events, at the university and in Montreal, contributed to the simmering crisis and its destructive conclusion.

In October 1968, a few months before the riot, Montreal had hosted two conferences on the position of black people in society. The first, at Sir George Williams, was organized by black alumni, several professors, and other members of the university. It engaged black organizations across Canada, who were represented by black leaders from Halifax to Vancouver. According to &quot;Expression&quot;, a quarterly publication of the Negro Citizenship Association Inc. (Conference Issue, Winter 1968), its purpose was to examine the &quot;problems in the Canadian society with reference to black people.&quot; The second, the Black Writers Conference, was hosted at McGill University. Its focus was &quot;the ideology of Black Power and Black Nationalism.&quot; These conferences, held weeks apart and at the two different venues, reflected formal agreements to disagree on priorities and span of action: domestic versus international. Both conferences contributed to the tensions at Sir George Williams University.

Other contributing factors included a series of miscommunications between the students and the university administration, and the nature of the university itself, which encouraged a non-traditional educational philosophy, openness, and accessible higher education to a wide range of students from different backgrounds and different social strata.

==Overview==
In Montreal, the estimated population of black people was 7,000 in 1961, which increased to 50,000 by 1968. McGill University was the first choice of university for many students but, since they had a strict admission policy, they could not be easily accepted. Sir George Williams University had a more lenient admissions policy and accepted students from various backgrounds. Classes were offered during the day and night (evening), which was convenient for many students. Sir George Williams University was very popular among international students.

The occupation was sparked by the university&#x27;s mishandling of racism allegations against assistant professor of biology Perry Anderson, who was accused of being biased in his grading of black students. In spring 1968, six black students from the West Indies accused Anderson of racism, charging that he had given them lower grades than what their work merited. One black student, Rawl Frederick, wrote a poem describing the atmosphere at Sir George Williams University. Entitled &quot;Man Trap&quot;, it read: &quot;They designate institutions, we disintegrate in infernos, They consummate animals that abort us, Nursing grounds for dysgenic beasts, Developing ghettoes/employing social workers to create Negroes. Man-trap, I know your name, your face.&quot;

Rodney John, one of the six students who made the complaint against Anderson, recalled in a 2019 interview: &quot;What made it even more farcical was the experience of Terrence (Ballantyne, another student). He had a White lab partner. Terrence handed in his lab. His lab gets 7 out of 10. His lab partner borrows Terrence’s lab and copies it word for word. The guy gets the lab back and guess what? He gets a higher mark and doesn’t get any marks deducted for being late. Just imagine you have 13 students each with their own stories. This was a pattern.&quot; Additionally, it was charged that in the classroom Anderson would address black students as &quot;mister&quot; while he addressed White students by their first names, which was widely seen as evidence that he was prejudiced against his black students. In September 1968, the complaints against Anderson of racial bias were denied by the university administration.

In general, the university administration had a patronizing and dismissive attitude towards the black students, taking the viewpoint that it was self-evident that Anderson was not a racist and the students complaining about him were just &quot;whiners&quot; unhappy with the failing grades that they had brought about themselves. When John asked to see the report clearing Anderson, he recalled: &quot;When we asked to see a copy of the report, nobody had a copy. Eventually it was stated the report had been sent to the principal. So we went to his office. He didn’t have a copy of the report either. What was told to us was it got lost in the internal mail.&quot; All through fall 1968, there was a mounting mood of frustration and rage by the black students against a university administration that was indifferent to their concerns. On January 28, 1969, &quot;The Georgian&quot;, the student newspaper, ran a special edition accusing Anderson of racism, and the university administration of a cover-up. The issue of &quot;The Georgian&quot; galvanized the student community, most of whom had been previously unaware of the matter.

Beginning on January 29, 1969, over 400 students occupied the university&#x27;s computer lab. Fed up with what they considered to be on the part of the administration, black and white students left a meeting and occupied the university computer lab on the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building. Two of the leaders of the students were Roosevelt &quot;Rosie&quot; Douglas and Anne Cools. John stated: &quot;We’re talking about an era of social change and development of a social consciousness. Many students were prepared to join the cause on that basis. At the height of the occupation you had anywhere from three to five hundred bodies involved. A great majority at that time were white students. But you also had black students who identified with the struggle. Racism was rampant in the community and the university was not insulated from that racism. And so you had a tremendous rippling effect.&quot;

Most of the occupation was quite peaceful: the police were not involved, and negotiations continued. On February 10, 1969, an agreement was reached under which the students would leave the Hall Building in exchange for a new committee to examine the allegations of prejudice against Anderson. However, most of the students refused to leave. The occupation continued until February 11, when negotiations broke down and riot police were called in to storm the Hall Building. After they learned that the university was planning to renege on the agreement, the remaining students began to barricade themselves in. The faculty of Sir George Williams University, siding with Anderson, vetoed the agreement to have a new committee appointed to examine the allegations of racial bias against black students. Instead, the administration asked the Montreal police to evict the students from the Hall Building.

As the police and the students fought in the halls, other students threw computer punch cards out of the windows, littering the streets above with thousands of punch cards. A fire broke out in the computer lab, forcing the occupiers out of the building; 97 of them were arrested. John accused the police of starting the fire: &quot;The violence was perpetuated — I have no hesitation saying this — by the police and the administration. Are students going to start a fire when they’re locked in?&quot;

As the building burned, the crowds watching the scene from below chanted, &quot;Let the niggers burn!&quot; and &quot;Burn, niggers, burn!&quot; As the students tried to escape from the burning building, they were arrested, subjected to racist insults and beaten savagely by the police. Once in custody, the 87 students were divided by race, with the 38 black students separated from the White students. The computer lab was destroyed, resulting in over $2 million in damage. The incident was recorded live by television crews, the most memorable image associated with the riot was smoke arising from the Hall Building while the streets were swamped with punch cards. Windows were broken and computer tapes and punch cards tossed onto the street below. The charges against most of the rioters were eventually dismissed. A total of 1,044 charges were brought by the Crown, of which only 50 were heard in court, nine were not held and 22 were dropped. The governor-general of Canada, Roland Michener, was touring the West Indies at the time. He was unable to give a speech at the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, as various radical students accused Canada of being a racist country. Public opinion in Canada was overwhelmingly against the students, who were denounced as &quot;rampaging criminals,&quot; &quot;thugs&quot; and &quot;anarchists.&quot; The man considered the leader of the protest, Kennedy Frederick of Grenada, was denied bail and brought to court in a cage as if he were an animal. The media blamed lax immigration laws that allowed &quot;trouble-making&quot; students from the West Indies to attend Canadian universities.

Among those arrested and convicted were Roosevelt Douglas, who later became Prime Minister of Dominica, and who was a son of one of the richest men in Dominica. Also arrested was Anne Cools, who later became a Canadian Senator. Deeply involved also was student Cheddi &quot;Joey&quot; Jagan Jr., who was of Indo-Guyanese and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the son of Cheddi Jagan, an American-educated dentist and former Premier and Chief Minister of British Guiana at the time, and his American wife Janet Jagan who was a nurse.

Some claim that the computer lab was not damaged, except for several million computer punch cards that were sent fluttering to the street below; but a Canadian Broadcast Corporation documentary shows smashed computer tape drives and extensive fire damage. The damage was listed in millions of dollars. It is unknown who caused the fire. The police accused the occupiers of the damages, while the occupiers accused the police of setting the fire as an easy way to get all the students out of the room without physically entering it. Other students claim that they saw police locking doors and exits that were normally open, and confiscating fire axes from students the day before the fire was set.

==Aftermath==

The riot was covered extensively by the Canadian media: all of the television networks filmed the event live from outside the university. The occupation became a key event illustrating the widespread disaffection and rebelliousness among the nation&#x27;s youth during the 1960s.

One protestor, Coralee Hutchison, suffered head trauma during the confrontation with police. She was hospitalized and later died.

Assistant professor Perry Anderson was suspended for the duration of the crisis. He was reinstated on February 12, 1969, and, on June 30, the Hearing Committee appointed to the case found that &quot;there was nothing in the evidence (before them) to substantiate a general charge of racism.&quot; He was found not guilty of racism towards the six complainants.&lt;ref name=&quot;archives.concordia.ca/computer-riot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer centre incident forced a number of changes at Sir George Williams University:
Student representation on university decision-making bodies was established and university procedures and policies were revamped and modernized.
In April 1971, Sir George Williams adopted the University Regulations on Rights and Responsibilities and established the Ombuds office.

The Sir George Williams affair also raised the question of racism in Canada. When the fire broke out during the destruction of the computer lab and many protesters were still in the building, some white passersby chanted ″Let the niggers burn.″

==Film==
In February 2014, director Mina Shum and producer Selwyn Jacob began shooting in Montreal on a National Film Board of Canada feature documentary entitled &quot;Ninth Floor&quot;, about the Sir George Williams Affair. Filming coincided with the 45th anniversary of the incident. The film had its world premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, on September 12. The film focuses on individuals who were connected to the incident, and how it shaped their lives. The film shows the events at the time, and follows up on the lives of those involved decades later.

<text>Thorpe Salvin is a village and a civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in South Yorkshire, England, on the border with Nottinghamshire. It lies between Worksop and Harthill, and is located at an elevation of around 110 metres above sea level. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 476, down from 502 in 2001.

The rectangular-towered parish church of St Peter, a predominantly 12th-century structure with 15th-century additions, is emblazoned with Norman carvings, and has been nominated among England&#x27;s 1,000 best churches. The village has a public house, the &quot;Parish Oven&quot;.

==History==
The name &quot;Thorpe&quot; derives from the Norse for an outlying farmstead, while &quot;Salvin&quot; refers to 13th century lord of the manor Ralph Salvain. There are earlier references to the settlement though, including a mention in the Domesday Book as &quot;Rynkenild Thorp&quot;, part of Roger de Busli&#x27;s Laughton en le Morthen estate. This name refers to the settlement&#x27;s place on the Roman road of Rynkenild Street, now &quot;Packman Lane&quot;. Within the bounds of the parish is Netherthorpe Airfield which has been active since 1933.

The noted Benedictine scholar and royal chaplain Serenus de Cressy was born here in about 1605.
===Thorpe Hall===
Thorpe Salvin contains the ruins of &quot;Thorpe Hall&quot;, a manor house designed and built by Robert Smythson in 1570. It was built on the site of the previous manor house which was the residence of an earlier lord of the manor, Sir Bryan Sandford, Knight, who fought for Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth Field, 19 August 1485. Sir Bryan was one of many who defected from Richard III&#x27;s army just days before the battle. For more information about this and the Sanford Family of Co.Yorks and Virginia, see the &quot;Sanford Index, Revised&quot;, by Charles M. Marsteller.

In 1636, the hall was bought by Edward Osborne. When his descendant Thomas Osborne became Duke of Leeds, he moved out to a grander property in Kiveton Park, and the hall fell into disuse. It was partially demolished in the 1820s, with only the south front now remaining. It is Grade II* Listed.

<text>Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School, commonly called Kitchener Collegiate Institute or KCI, is a public secondary school in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. It is a member of the Waterloo Region District School Board. The school dates from 1855, making it one of the oldest high schools in Kitchener and Waterloo. Its sports teams are known as the Raiders.

==History==
The school opened on April 2, 1855, as the Berlin Senior Boys&#x27; Grammar School. It was initially located at the corner of King and Eby streets in the downtown area; tuition was five shillings per month. From 1857 to 1871, it occupied space in the Berlin Central School (now Suddaby Public School) on Frederick Street. Girls were admitted to the school in 1866. With increasing numbers at the Central School, the school moved to the former Swedenborgian Church on Church Street.

In 1874, $650 was spent to purchase land at the school&#x27;s current location on King Street West, closer to the Waterloo border. The building cost $5,804 and opened in 1876. It was now called Berlin High School (Ontario legislation passed in 1871 renamed grammar schools &quot;high schools&quot;).

In 1876, science teacher David Forsyth pioneered laboratory experiments. By 1891, the curriculum had grown to include commercial subjects, music, manual training, and athletics.

In 1903, building commenced on the first of ten additions to the school. During construction, some classes were moved to the Kitchener City Hall and Carnegie library. On November 30, 1904, a Provincial-Order-in-Council raised the school to the status of a collegiate institute, and the school was renamed the Berlin Collegiate Institute. By 1905 the new building was in use. The school&#x27;s name changed to Kitchener Collegiate Institute, along with the city, in 1916 during the First World War.

By 1919, office and other rooms were being used as classrooms. As the Dominion and Provincial governments had recently announced a policy to assist with school funding, the municipality eventually approved an expansion plan in 1921. The plan called for demolishing the 1876 building, modernizing the 1903-04 building, which still stands, and placing in front of it a new gymnasium, auditorium, front hall, and classrooms, including a classroom east wing. Construction started on July 2, 1922, and the new school opened on September 4, 1923. At the formal opening on April 4, 1924, the school received its current name, Kitchener Collegiate and Vocational Institute.

The 1924 enrolment of 550 students had increased to 1,418 students by 1932. Because of cramped conditions, grade 9 classes were held in downtown Victoria Public School and in neighbouring King Edward Public School from 1933 to 1951, when the west-wing addition was completed.

In 1948, KCI introduced driver education, one of the first schools to do so.

In 1955, KCI celebrated its 100th anniversary, the only public high school in Kitchener and Waterloo. However, in 1956, Eastwood Collegiate Institute opened, the first of seven additional high schools built in the following 20 years. Several of their principals were former KCI teachers.

In 1969, the Kitchener and Waterloo High School Board was succeeded by the Waterloo County Board of Education, now the Waterloo Region District School Board (WRDSB).

In the 1970s, the City of Kitchener designated the school foyer as a heritage structure under the provisions of the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;.

At the school&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations on the weekend of May 16–18, 1980, more than 6,000 former students took part.

In 2003, public outcry ensued when the WRDSB proposed closing KCI in order to open Huron Heights Secondary School in southwest Kitchener, as required under the provincial funding model of the time. Critics of this proposal noted that KCI had a significant history and a unique culture among regional secondary schools, including its diverse student body. Further financial analysis of the financial situation by trustees determined that no need for a Kitchener school closure, and the WRDSB decided to update KCI&#x27;s aging infrastructure. Regardless of the enormous job and associated costs, 

In 2004, football coach Ed Dietrich was selected runner-up &quot;NFL/CFL High School Coach of the Year&quot;.

In 2005, the school celebrated its 150th anniversary reunion from May 27–29.

In 2006, the school underwent extensive renovations, funded by the provincial government. Some students are concerned that there is still no air conditioning.

In March 2017, KCI opened its renovated main office. The space now includes a new meeting room, staff mailbox area and unisex washrooms; construction used wood reclaimed from the original office.

==Traditions==
The school colours are red, yellow, and black (adopted from the flag of Germany because of the city&#x27;s German heritage), and its motto is &quot;Veritas Vincat&quot; (Latin, May Truth Prevail); until 1916 the motto was &quot;Höher Hinauf&quot; (German, To the Heights). At various points since his introduction, there have been contentious debates about the propriety of the former school mascot, a First Nations raider named Rodney. Citing the issue of racism and pressure from special interest groups, the school changed the mascot to a pirate while maintaining the &quot;Raider&quot; name.

==Notable alumni==
The most famous alumnus of the school was William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada for more than 21 years, who was a student between 1887 and 1891. During the school&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebrations, a statue of him as a student was unveiled on the front lawn of the school.

<doc id="712056" wikidata="Q3240053" url="?curid=712056" title="Concession road">
<text>In Upper and Lower Canada, concession roads were laid out by the colonial government through undeveloped Crown land to provide access to rows of newly surveyed lots intended for farming by new settlers. The land that comprised a row of lots that spanned the entire length of a new township was &quot;conceded&quot; by the Crown for this purpose (hence, a &quot;concession of land&quot;). Title to an unoccupied lot was awarded to an applicant in exchange for raising a house, performing roadwork and land clearance, and monetary payment. Concession roads and cross-cutting &quot;sidelines&quot; or &quot;sideroads&quot; were laid out in an orthogonal (rectangular or square) grid plan, often aligned so that concession roads ran (approximately) parallel to the north shore of Lake Ontario, or to the southern boundary line of a county.

Unlike previous American colonial practice, land in Ontario was surveyed first before being allocated to settlers.

The provision of road allowances was an advance over earlier survey systems which allocated no roadways. Waterloo township, for example, had no road allowances.

In some townships, the &quot;line road&quot; name (e.g., Ninth Line) was applied to the roads that elsewhere were called &quot;concession roads&quot;, i.e., roads that ran between two adjacent concessions.

==Survey systems==
By one count, there were five major Ontario survey systems, with 166 variations, resulting in a &quot;crazy quilt&quot; of surveys. In many cases special colonization roads ran diagonally across the grid. Survey lines referenced back from the Great Lakes ran at different angles, forming triangles and other irregular shapes. Some townships had more than one survey. Holland, Nelson and Toronto Township (today Mississauga) are examples.

In a common square grid layout known as a 1,000-Acre Sectional System, adjacent parallel roads were 100 chains or apart, and arranged as ten 100-acre lots each 20 chains by 50 chains
so that two consecutive concession roads and two consecutive side roads enclosed a square of .

Another system used 100-acre lots each 30 by chains, again arranged in 1000-acre blocks. Concession roads were apart, while sideroads were apart.

Other plans used during colonial surveying used different layouts and lot sizes of 100, 150, 160, 200 or 320 acres.
In a &quot;single-front&quot; survey, lots were measured from one side of the concession to the other. Any errors in the survey became apparent at the road junctions, with the side roads being offset.Example Jogged Intersection in Single Front Township

In a &quot;double-front&quot; survey, lots were measured from the front of the concession to a midpoint, and then from the back of the concession to the midpoint. This makes the road junctions even, but any errors result in jogs at the midpoint of the side road. Example Even-Intersection Jogged-Sideroad in Double Front Township
==Special terms==
* &quot;Road allowance&quot;—a strip of land for provision of a public road between lots. Typically 66 feet wide or one chain.
* &quot;Unopened road allowance&quot; - is a public highway that has not been opened and assumed for maintenance purposes by-law of the township.
* &quot;Baseline&quot;—The first concession road in a township, was often called the &quot;baseline&quot; (from the surveying term), and roads so named remain in many municipalities, including Ottawa, Clarington and London.
* &quot;Front&quot;—the first concession road was also frequently called the &quot;front&quot;.
* &quot;Broken front&quot;—concession along a lake shore.
* &quot;Townline&quot;—a boundary line or road between two townships, e.g., Adjala-Tecumseth Townline. Note that townlines might be side roads.
* &quot;Given roads&quot;—special roads made to avoid natural obstacles that interfere with the grid.
* &quot;Gore&quot;—triangular shaped lots

==Concession road numbering==
There is considerable variation in concession road nomenclature. Markham, for example, has both &quot;Ninth Line&quot; and &quot;11th Concession Road&quot;. 

In some townships, numbering is sequential, starting from one side. For example, in King Township, concessions start from Yonge. Bathurst is the (former) Second Concession road, between concessions 1 and 2 (forms the front of the second concession of land). There is no &quot;first&quot; concession road.

In some townships, the baseline passed through the middle, with concessions numbered on each side. 
*For example, in Peel Region and Dufferin County, Hurontario Street is the centre line, with concession line roads to either side being numbered East or West. In present-day Mississauga (which has two surveys, divided by Eglinton Avenue) Kennedy Road is the former &quot;First Line East&quot; in the northern survey, and McLaughlin Road is the former &quot;First Line West&quot;. The abbreviations &quot;EHS&quot; for &quot;East of Hurontario Street&quot; and &quot;WHS&quot; for &quot;West of Hurontario Street&quot; are used in Dufferin.
*In Warwick Township in Lambton County, the Egremont Road was the baseline, with successive concessions numbered either &quot;North of the Egremont Road&quot; (&quot;NER&quot;) or &quot;South of the Egremont Road&quot; (&quot;SER&quot;).

In some townships, such as those in Bruce County, each side of each successive concession road comprised a separate numbered concession. Thus, the south side of a road might be Concession 2 and the north side Concession 3. In this system, for the purposes of road signing only even (or, sometimes, odd) numbers were used, so that concession roads were successively numbered, e.g., 2, 4, 6, etc. This simplified the address numbering of farm lots, especially along township boundary roads where opposite sides of the same road were in different townships. Where even numbers were used, the numbers of odd-numbered concessions would appear only in property records (e.g., &quot;Lot 18, Concession 11, Brant Township&quot;, which would be on the north side of Concession Road 10).

Many concession roads retain their original names. Less developed areas are often referred to as &quot;back concessions&quot;.

==Side road numbering==
Side road or sideline numbering varies depending on the township. Some examples: 
* Sequential—In King Township, sideroads were numbered consecutively. The last concession road was 13, so the first sideroad was 14, the next 15, and so on.
* By adjacent lot number—Many townships in Bruce County, are numbered in multiples of 5, i.e., starting with the &quot;town line&quot; (road on township boundary), then numbered 5th, 10th, 15th, and so on, with five lots between each pair of successive sidelines in the original township survey. The side road number is tied to the adjacent lot number.

Many side roads are no longer numbered, but have been given names. For example, most of Renfrew County&#x27;s side roads are given names such as Stokes Road, Patterson Road, Dillabough Road, Cheese Factory Road. The naming process has been underway for many years.

==Impact==
In most of Upper Canada this layout of roads preceded urban development, so that most Ontario municipalities now have grid patterns of streets. In cities, many concession roads have become major streets. However, a few of the &quot;sideline&quot; roads in urban areas still retain their historic numbered lines or use &quot;Line&quot; for their street designations: Brown&#x27;s Line, Ninth Line, and Guelph Line are important thoroughfares in Toronto and its western suburbs.

<text>Streetsville Secondary School is a high school in the Peel District School Board located in the Streetsville Village community of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.

==Description and history==
Streetsville Secondary School was opened in 1958. The school currently has approximately 900+ students enrolled, with about half enrolled in the French Immersion program.

The school features a main floor and a second floor on its north side which consists of mostly English, Math, Geography and history classes. It has two gymnasiums, one large in size, and the second being half the size of the first. When the school first opened, the smaller gym was originally intended to be a swimming pool. The school also has a library, which was renovated and expanded, a weight room, and a cafeteria.

The school has several unusual classes including Grade 11 and 12 Photographic Arts, the unusual aspect being the darkroom available for student use, one of the last remaining in the Peel school system. Also available to students is Music Production, a course teaching the recording and mastering of music using computers.

In 2005, the French immersion programme for students was introduced at Streetsville Secondary School where students can learn bilingualism in Canada. The courses offered are: French Immersion (Grades 9-12), Science, and Geography of Canada (Grade 9), Contemporary Canadian History, Career Studies, and Civics (Grade 10), World History to the 16th Century (Grade 11), and Canadian and World Issues: A Geographic Analysis (Grade 12).

Up until the summer of 2005, the school had 13 portable buildings. However, in 2005, Mississauga Secondary School opened in the area and about half of the grade 9 and 10 students attending Streetsville had to switch schools due to boundary changes. This dropped the overall attendance by about 500, and all of the portables except one were removed. The sole portable remaining was used as an extension of the school&#x27;s drama room until it was removed in 2006 due to budget cuts. 

A $7 million renovation/expansion during the summer of 2015 and the 2015–16 school year included a 6-classroom extension and an elevator.

==Sports==

Streetsville Secondary School offers many athletic opportunities, including: rugby, basketball, volleyball, track and field, hockey, swimming, badminton, flag football, and rugby sevens. Streetsville has won Senior Boys ROPSSAA (Region of Peel Secondary Schools Athletic Association) Gold Medal in Rugby, as well as an OFSAA Gold Medal, finishing their 2012 season with 32 wins and 0 losses. The school also has an archery team that does exceptionally well each year winning many Olympic class Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals in ROPSSAA and OFSAA. Also, in 2021 the Senior Boys Volleyball team went 0-4 in OFSAA located in North Bay.

Streetsville won its only hockey championship in 2005, coming from behind in both the semi-final and final. The win is still one of the most celebrated events at school reunions.

The junior girls rugby team maintained an 8 game winning streak in the 2022 15s season. They finished 1st at ROPSSAA, defeating St. Francis Xavier 31-0 in the final.

<doc id="712067" wikidata="Q7796693" url="?curid=712067" title="Thorpe Hall (Peterborough)">
<text>Thorpe Hall at Longthorpe in the city of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, is a Grade I listed building, built by Peter Mills between 1653 and 1656, for the Lord Chief Justice, Oliver St John. The house is unusual in being one of the very few mansions built during the Commonwealth period. After a period as a hospital, it is currently used as a Sue Ryder hospice.

While parliamentary soldiers were in Peterborough in 1643 during the English Civil War, they ransacked the cathedral. Parliament disposed of Church property to raise money for the army and navy and the parliamentarian Oliver St John bought the lease to the manor of Longthorpe and built Thorpe Hall. In 1654 it was described by the author John Evelyn as &quot;a stately place...built out of the ruins of the Bishop&#x27;s Palace and cloisters.&quot;

A symmetrical composition in ashlar, rusticated quoins, with square, groups of rusticated chimney shafts; the north and south elevations are identical, three dormers, casements under pediments, the centre one semi-circular. A stone slate roof overhangs on modillions. There are seven windows, with plain stone surrounds to top and ground floors. The porch with Tuscan columns supports a balcony. The balcony window on the first floor has a segmental pediment and shouldered architrave. The windows of the second and sixth bays have pediments, while the others have frieze and moulded cornice. A band marks first-floor height. There is a flight of eight steps with balustrade supporting two urns.

The interior is complete, except for library or Great Parlour panelling now at Leeds Castle. There may have been two designers, Mills and John Stone, a French-trained son of Nicholas Stone. Principal rooms have richly decorated fireplaces and plaster ceilings by Peter Mills. The principal staircase has heavily carved foliated open panels to broad balustrade. A stone screen on the landing was added in 1850 by Francis Ruddle of Peterborough.

Thorpe Hall is situated in a Grade II listed garden that is open to members of the public throughout the year. The curved walls forming the entrance courtyard, gatepiers and entrance gates, former stables to the right, and a shouldered stone architrave gateway flanked by vertically halved pilasters with volutes are also Grade I listed buildings. The late 19th-century lodge, octagonal summerhouse in red brick with fish scale slate roof, and a free-standing archway resembling a Venetian window in design are Grade II listed buildings.

A maternity hospital from 1943 to 1970, it was transferred to the National Health Service in 1948, coming under No. 12 Group (Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals Management Committee) of the East Anglian Regional Hospital Board. In 1986 it was acquired by the Sue Ryder Foundation and is currently in use as a hospice.

<text>At the 2000 Summer Olympics, three different gymnastics disciplines were contested: artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, and trampoline. The artistic gymnastics and trampoline events were held at the Sydney SuperDome on 16–25 September and 22–23 September, respectively. The rhythmic gymnastics events were held at Pavilion 3 of the Sydney Olympic Park on 28 September – 1 October.

==Artistic gymnastics==

===Format of competition===
No compulsory routines were performed in artistic gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Instead, all participating gymnasts, including those who were not part of a team, participated in a qualification round. The results of this competition determined which teams and individuals participated in the remaining competitions, which included:

*The team competition, in which the six highest scoring teams from qualifications competed. Each team of six gymnasts could have up to five gymnasts perform on each apparatus, and only the four highest scores counted toward the team total.
*The all-around competition, in which the thirty-six highest scoring individuals in the all-around competed. Each country was limited to three gymnasts in the all-around final.
*The event finals, in which the eight highest scoring individuals on each apparatus competed. Each country was limited to two gymnasts in each apparatus final.

===Men&#x27;s events===
===Women&#x27;s events===
Andreea Răducan originally won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s all-around competition, but she was disqualified after she tested positive for pseudoephedrine.

The Federation Internationale de Gymnastique Executive Board announced on 27 February 2010 after an investigation into the Chinese team for violations of age rules for senior gymnastics competitions that team member Dong Fangxiao, who had been entered as 17 years old, was actually 14 at the time of the Olympics (two years below the minimum age). Her 1999 World Championships and 2000 Olympic results were struck from the records, and in April 2010, nearly ten years after the event, the IOC officially disqualified China, who had originally won the bronze medal in the women&#x27;s team event.

The now-third place team from the United States was awarded the bronze at the 2010 national championships, held at the XL Center in Hartford, CT.

<text>The Woodlands School is a public elementary and secondary school in Mississauga, Ontario, under the Peel District School Board. It has a diverse student population, with large numbers of students of South and East Asian backgrounds. The school has an English as a Second Language (ESL) program to assist new immigrants, and a Peer Assisted Learning (PALS) program. The school is also a Regional Enhanced Learning Centre for the secondary program.

== History ==

The Woodlands School was opened in the year 1969. While the first phase of its present building was under construction, classes operated within Springfield Public School building. In September 1970, the students and staff moved to the new building, and The Woodlands became a combined elementary and secondary school. 

The facility received a major renovation throughout 2016. This renovation implemented a new open concept design to the front of the school, and also removed the old library building attached to the school, replacing it with a new elementary classroom wing. An elevator was later built near the front of the school.
