<text>Amiga Power (AP) was a monthly magazine about Amiga video games. It was published in the United Kingdom by Future Publishing and ran for 65 issues, from May 1991 to September 1996.

==History==
The first issue of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; was published in May 1991 after Future Publishing decided, in response to feedback from readers of its magazine &quot;Amiga Format&quot;, to launch two further magazines with narrowed interests, the other being &quot;Amiga Shopper&quot;. Whereas the latter would focus on the &quot;serious&quot; side of Amiga computers involving programming and productivity, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; would be wholly tailored to the gaming audience. Joining the magazine were Matt Bielby and Gary Penn, previously editors of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; and &quot;The One&quot;, respectively, with Bielby being its first editor and Penn as a consultant.

Early in the magazine&#x27;s history, from its inception, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; supplied copies of each issue with a coverdisk containing a full game, distributed to the reader free of charge. Future Publishing pioneered the concept of attaching disks to covers of &quot;Amiga Format&quot;. However, software publishers complained that people were disincentivised from purchasing their games, and &quot;Amiga Power&quot;, along with other British computer magazines, soon abandoned the practice in favour of &quot;public domain&quot; (i.e. free-of-charge) software, shareware, and demos.

==Philosophy==
&quot;Amiga Power&quot; had several principles which comprised its philosophy regarding games. Like almost all Amiga magazines of the time, it marked games according to a percentage scale. However, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; firmly believed that the full range of this scale should be used when reviewing games. A game of average quality rated on this scale would therefore be awarded 50%. Stuart Campbell offered some rationale for this in his review of &quot;Kick Off &#x27;96&quot; in the final issue of the magazine:

&quot;Amiga Power&quot; had a section at the front of each issue listing other magazines&#x27; scores for games, some with a star next to them indicating that they &quot;appear[ed] as an exclusive, cover disk or a cover&quot;, the purpose of the section being to dissuade their readers from subscribing to those magazines concurrently. According to Campbell, those magazines tended to score games along the pattern of &quot;70%, 70%, 70%, 99%&quot;. &quot;Amiga Power&quot;″s methodology proved controversial amongst game publishers, including, in particular, Team17, who would withdraw their advertising and refuse to send them review copies of their games in advance. The magazine found that its competitors&#x27; reviewers were influenced by the publishers&#x27; campaigns to offer incentives such as perks and free trips in exchange for marking their games highly.

==Style==
&quot;Amiga Power&quot; reviews were often written in a very personal, informal manner. The writers often used in-jokes, obscure references and running gags. Writers would sometimes embark on anecdotes of recent happenings in the &quot;AP&quot; office, or of their interactions with the other &quot;AP&quot; staff. This contributed to &quot;AP&quot; reputation for self-indulgence, but it also created a sense of familiarity.

===Writers===
Many prominent video game journalists, such as Kieron Gillen and Stuart Campbell used &quot;AP&quot; as a first step in their career. Gillen, now a successful writer for Marvel Comics, was one of several writers who started off as an &quot;AP&quot; reader and letter-writer (under the name &quot;C-Monster&quot;) before being employed by the magazine as a freelance contributor. Another was Mil Millington (known to &quot;AP&quot; readers as &quot;Reader Millington&quot;), who would go on to become a successful novelist, selling over 100,000 copies of his debut &quot;Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About&quot;.

Throughout its 65 issues, &quot;AP&quot; went through several editors. The editors, ordered by time, were:
#Matt Bielby, &quot;AP&quot; first editor (issues 1-15)
#Mark Ramshaw (issues 16-24)
#Linda Barker, &quot;AP&quot; only female editor (issues 25–26; issues 27-36 were edited by Stuart Campbell after Linda fell sick, although he never held the title of editor)
#Jonathan Davies (issues 37-50)
#Cam Winstanley (issues 51-55)
#Tim Norris (issues 59-62)
#Steve Faragher (issues 63-65)

Issues 56-58 were published with no designated editor.

===Concept reviews===
A concept review is a review conducted in an abstract manner - basically, any review which deviates significantly from the usual practice of describing a game and analysing its strengths and weaknesses. Usually, it takes the form of a work of fiction (often a screenplay) which indirectly reviews the game through allegory. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; featured concept reviews on a regular basis. The term itself (never actually used in the magazine) was an ironic play on the &quot;concept albums&quot; released by prog rock bands of the 1970s.

===Competitions===
Competitions were also run in &quot;AP&quot; distinctive style, often challenging the readers&#x27; wit or creativity. &quot;AP&quot; frequently provided strange additions to the usual competition rules, such as making peculiar threats to people who were ineligible to enter the competition if they tried to, or specifically disallowing reader Stuart N. Hardy from entering the competition.

===Characters===
Like its spiritual predecessor, &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; had several joke characters who would make irregular appearances in reviews and features. These included Uncle Joe Stalin, who made occasional Ed Comments in an attempt to erase Stuart Campbell from history; The Four Cyclists of the Apocalypse, the only minor deities committed to rigorous consumer testing; Doris Stokes, who returned from the dead as an even worse medium than before, and several others besides.

==&quot;Amiga Power&quot; regular features==

===Oh Dear===
One of the earliest &quot;Amiga Power&quot; features which appeared in True Stories was Oh Dear, a small monthly feature showcasing poorly rated Amiga games. Oh Dear was removed very early on in the &quot;Amiga Power&quot; series.

===Kangaroo Court===
A regular feature which presents a so-called video game &quot;crime&quot;, followed by the &quot;case for the prosecution&quot;, which is a section illustrating why the crime is a negative thing. The penalty was usually an execution. In reflection of the nature of a real kangaroo court, there is no &quot;case for the defense&quot;.

===In The Style Of===
An &quot;In The Style Of&quot; is, as the name implies, a depiction of a game in the style of something else, most often another game. It started out as a Back Page feature but was soon thrown open to readers as a kind of competition and moved to the news section.

Readers could send in floppy disks containing their In The Style Of drawn in &quot;Deluxe Paint&quot;, and every month &quot;Amiga Power&quot; would select the one they liked best and feature it in the magazine.

===The Disseminator===
This feature appeared toward the end of &quot;AP&quot; life. It was simply a table of recent games, and the percentage scores that they received from &quot;Amiga Power&quot; and the two main competing Amiga games magazines of the time: &quot;The One Amiga&quot; and &quot;Amiga Action&quot;. It also contained annotations on some of the games.

===Just Who Do We Think We Are?===
While other magazines used at most a modest box (the &quot;masthead&quot;) to introduce their reviewers, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; dedicated a full page to their staff, with photographs and short sections for each member.

===Points of View===
Points of View was a table summarising each &quot;AP&quot; reviewer&#x27;s opinion of the main games reviewed that month, if they had played them. The reviewers had room to make a short comment and give their personal score from one to five stars.

===Do the Write Thing===
&quot;Do the Write Thing&quot; (an obvious pun on the movie &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;) was the magazine&#x27;s letters page. One distinguishing feature of the letters page was that the magazine gave the letters titles by taking excerpts of the letters&#x27; contents out of context, often by going across sentence boundaries or cutting in the middle of a clause.

==Amiga Power irregular features==

===APATTOH===
APATTOH, meaning Amiga Power All Time Top One Hundred, was a yearly feature. It originally started in &quot;AP&quot; issue No. 0 (a special &quot;preview issue&quot; of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; given away as an addition to an issue of &quot;Amiga Format&quot;), and later appeared approximately in every issue whose number was divisible by 12, plus 1.

APATTOH ranked games depending on how the staff liked them. This meant that games that got good press at the time when they came out could end up very low (or entirely absent) on the list. A notable example is &quot;&quot;, which most other magazines of the time reviewed positively, but &quot;Amiga Power&quot; ranked #100 in their top 100 list (emphasising the point by placing it one place below a public-domain version of &quot;Pong&quot;).

There were two games that held an iron grip on the #1 spot in the list. The first was Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2, a coin-op conversion platform game that the magazine controversially deemed their favorite Amiga game for the first two years of its existence. The second was &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;, which took over the top position in the first &quot;AP&quot; Top 100 after its release (the game came out too late for the 1992 chart), and never relinquished it (except to its own sequel &quot;Sensible World Of Soccer&quot;) for the rest of the magazine&#x27;s existence.

===F-Max===
In its later years, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; started advertising a fictional refreshment beverage called &quot;F-Max, the lightly sparkling fish drink&quot;, with the slogan &quot;an ocean of refreshment&quot;.

==Amiga Power: The Album With &quot;Attitude&quot;==
In early 2019, an &quot;Amiga Power&quot; fan launched a Kickstarter campaign to create an officially licensed &quot;AP&quot; tribute album containing remixes of assorted Amiga game tunes, accompanied by a booklet featuring contributions from former members of the magazine&#x27;s team. The campaign was successful, and in July 2020 the finished album was officially released.

Most of the remixes were created by the original composers; among those who contributed to the album were Alistair Bowness, Allister Brimble, Fabio Cicciarello, Mike Clarke, Adam Fothergill, Olof Gustafsson, Jon Hare, Chris Huelsbeck, Carl Jermy, Barry Leitch, Jogeir Liljedahl, Alex May, Anthony Milas, Jason Page, Matthias Steinwachs, and Tim Wright.

The physical album took the form of a small hardback book, with two CDs attached to the inside of the front and back covers, and the 100-page &quot;Mighty Booklet&quot; sandwiched between them. The first CD – subtitled &quot;AP&#x27;s Pick Of The Pops&quot; – featured remixes of music personally selected by AP team members (including former editors Matt Bielby, Mark Ramshaw, Linda Barker, Stuart Campbell, Jonathan Davies, Cam Winstanley, Tim Norris and Steve Faragher, plus others), nwhile the second CD – subtitled &quot;The AP Bonus Coverdisk&quot; – featured remixes inspired games and demos that appeared on the magazine&#x27;s cover-mounted disks over the years. The &quot;Mighty Booklet&quot; contained detailed information about each of the tracks featured on the album, including interviews with the musicians, behind-the-scenes facts, anecdotes and asides from the AP team and full song lyrics; a special &quot;The Last Resort&quot; section written by Rich Pelley; adverts for &quot;F-Max&quot; and a &quot;Canoe Squad&quot; movie; a feature entitled &quot;The Bum Line&quot;, based on &quot;The Bottom Line&quot;, listing other albums of interest; and an ongoing storyline (following on from the events of AP65) in which the AP team are restored to life by &quot;The Four Cyclists Of The Apocalypse,&quot; so they can attend a concert in their honor.

As of August 2020, the album remains available to buy via the original Kickstarter homepage and is also on the websites of C64Audio.com and 010101 Music.

<doc id="723810" wikidata="Q862343" url="?curid=723810" title="Bill Newton Dunn">
<text>William Francis Newton Dunn (born 3 October 1941) is a British politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1979 to 1994, 1999 to 2014 and again from 2019 until the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU in 2020. He resigned from the Conservative Party in 2000 in protest of its euroscepticism and joined the Liberal Democrats.

Newton Dunn first represented Lincolnshire as an MEP (1979–1994), then the East Midlands (1999–2014; 2019–2020).

==Early life==
Born at Greywell, Hampshire, son of Lieutenant-Colonel Owen Frank Newton Dunn, OBE and Barbara née Brooke, he was educated at Marlborough College, Wiltshire from 1955 to 1959. After going up to read Natural Sciences (Physics and Chemistry) at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, he studied at Paris-Sorbonne in 1960, and graduated MA (Cantab) in 1963. He then received a tri-lingual MBA from the INSEAD Business school at Fontainebleau, where he studied from 1965 to 1966. From 1963 to 1979, he worked in industry in the United Kingdom.

==Parliamentary career==
Newton Dunn contested Carmarthen at the February 1974 general election.

He was Conservative Party MEP for Lincolnshire from 1979 to 1994, during which time most European Parliament constituencies in the UK were single-member and the MEPs therein were elected by the first-past-the-post system. He stood for the new seat of Lincolnshire and Humberside South in 1994, but lost to Labour candidate Veronica Hardstaff by 83,172 votes (42.4%) to 69,427 (35.4%).

After a spell out of parliament, Newton Dunn was re-elected a Conservative MEP for the East Midlands in 1999, after the UK adopted systems of proportional representation generally rather than merely for Northern Ireland. He crossed the floor to the Liberal Democrats in 2000 because he felt that the Conservatives were increasingly negative towards the prospect of Britain playing a leading and positive role in Europe.

He was elected as a Liberal Democrat MEP for the first time in the 2004 election. He said he had the highest attendance record of all the UK MEPs when elected. He was re-elected in 2009.

Newton Dunn began to use the now much-used phrase &quot;democratic deficit&quot; in his pamphlet in the 1980s. This phrase first appeared in the manifesto of the Young European Federalists adopted at their congress in Berlin in 1977 (drafted by the future Labour MEP Richard Corbett).

In 2010, Newton Dunn signed the Spinelli Group manifesto in favour of a Federal Europe.

On 4 July 2012, he was the only British MEP to vote in favour of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). Only 38 MEPs voted with him, while 478 voted against the treaty; this was the biggest defeat in the history of the European Union.

He stood for re-election in the 2014 election but was defeated.

Newton Dunn was Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate in Hayes and Harlington in the June 2017 general election. In May 2018, he was elected to Richmond London Borough Council as a councillor for the South Richmond ward.

In the 2019 European Parliament election, Newton Dunn was first on the Liberal Democrat list for the East Midlands and was elected.

At the beginning of the Ninth European Parliament, he was the longest serving MEP (discounting periods outside Parliament) and the only MEP from the First European Parliament in 1979 (40 years previously) still holding a seat.

==Personal life==
In 1970, Newton Dunn married Anna Terez Árki; they have two children: Tom Newton Dunn, former political editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper and Daisy Newton Dunn, a TV producer for the BBC.

He and his wife divide their time between homes in Navenby, Lincolnshire, and Richmond, South West London.

Newton Dunn is a Freeman of the City of London and a Liveryman of the Haberdashers&#x27; Company.

<doc id="723822" wikidata="Q2641544" url="?curid=723822" title="Mega Man Legends">
<text>Mega Man Legends is a sub-series in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; franchise. While the main series is known for its 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay with story that is told through cutscenes, this series instead features 3D action-adventure gameplay and a more detailed story.

==Plot overview==
The games are set in the distant future; a time when the planet Earth is mostly ocean, leaving some islands left for civilization to prosper on. Based on the in-game dialogue, the series takes place at least in the 6th millennium. By this time frame, the original humans have been replaced by artificial lifeforms almost identical to them which can produce offspring with almost no effort.

The player controls Mega Man Volnutt, a teenage digger and archaeologist of sorts who searches underground ruins mainly for Quantum Refractors, which are the civilization&#x27;s primary source of energy. He was found as a baby on Nino Island at the bottom of the closed-off Nino Ruins and was raised by Professor Barrel Caskett along with his granddaughter Roll Caskett.

Giving them trouble is the Bonnes, a group of pirates consisting of leader Teisel Bonne, his sister (though the booklet says daughter) Tron Bonne (who is also allegedly infatuated with Mega Man), their baby brother Bon Bonne who somehow can drive a large mech suit (known primarily for his repeated line, &quot;Babu!&quot;, which has become a catchphrase among the series&#x27; fans), and the 41 Servbots (one of which is only in &quot;The Misadventures of Tron Bonne&quot;). More trouble is given to Mega Man by the Reaverbots, the techno-organic semi-intelligent residents of the underground ruins who serve to protect its contents.

==Games==
The first game in the series, &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; (titled &quot;Rockman DASH: Hagane no Bōkenshin&quot; in Japan), was released for PlayStation in December 1997. It was the first fully 3-D action-adventure &quot;Mega Man&quot; game and introduced new mechanics to the franchise such as RPG elements and a sandbox style environment for Mega Man to explore. The game was later ported to Nintendo 64 in 2000, to Microsoft Windows in 2001, and to PlayStation Portable in 2005.

&quot;The Misadventures of Tron Bonne&quot; (titled &quot;Tron ni Kobun&quot; in Japan) is a prequel title taking place before the events of the original &quot;Legends&quot;, focusing on the origin story of series antihero Tron Bonne. It features various styles of gameplay, including action, puzzle and treasure hunting. It was released for the PlayStation in July 1999 in Japan and in April and June of 2000 for North America and Europe respectively.

 is the prologue episode to &quot;Legends 2&quot;, bundled with Japanese copies of &quot;The Misadventures of Tron Bonne&quot; released in July 1999. It features four missions titled &quot;Roll&#x27;s Secret Training&quot;, &quot;Capture Pigs&quot;, &quot;Underground Dungeon&quot; and &quot;Jagd Krabbe&#x27;s Assault&quot;, all of which take place before the events of &quot;Legends 2&quot;. 

&quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot; (titled &quot;Rockman DASH 2 - Episode 2: Ōinaru Isan&quot; in Japan) was released in April 2000 for the PlayStation and is the final mainline game produced by Capcom in the series. &quot;Legends 2&quot; is similar to the original but features a more streamlined realtime 3-D action gameplay system and allows the player to explore multiple smaller islands and locations in the sky in contrast to the original&#x27;s single island. The game ends in an infamous unresolved cliffhanger that results in Mega Man Volnutt being stranded on a remote satellite called &quot;Elysium&quot;. Ports for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation Portable followed in 2003 and 2005 respectively, as well as a re-release in 2015 for the PlayStation Network service on PlayStation 3, alongside &quot;Misadventures of Tron Bonne&quot; and the original &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot;.

, was unveiled for mobile phones on September 23, 2007, at the Tokyo Game Show, and subsequently released it in early 2008. The title is set between the first and second game.

In September 2010, Capcom announced &quot;Mega Man Legends 3&quot; to be developed for the then upcoming Nintendo 3DS, as well as an early access prologue version called &quot;Mega Man Legends 3: Prototype Version&quot; but the game and its prologue were both ultimately cancelled in July 2011.

==Development==
At one point Capcom had planned to release 1997&#x27;s &quot;Mega Man Legends&quot; in the US under the domesticated title &quot;Mega Man Neo&quot;, and then &quot;Mega Man Nova&quot;.

Keiji Inafune, who was the producer on all three Legends games, has for many games has consistently expressed interest in making a third installment. Inafune stated &quot;[My favorite game is] Mega Man Legends, a title that really didn&#x27;t sell well in the Mega Man franchise&quot; at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. He claims that creating a Rockman game for the next generation consoles would cost around $15 million to fund and develop. &quot;Mega Man Legends 3&quot; was announced for the Nintendo 3DS on September 29, 2010, during a Nintendo press conference for the 3DS, nearly ten years after the American release of &quot;Mega Man Legends 2&quot;. In September 2007, Keiji Inafune commented that he was asked by several fans if &quot;Mega Man Legends 3&quot; would be made; although Inafune expressed a desire to make such a game, he stated that he could not do it at that time. Detailed information about the game was announced at the New York Comic Con in October 2010. Although Inafune left Capcom in November 2010, the team working for &quot;Mega Man Legends 3&quot; stated that the game would continue development. Capcom intended to release &quot;Mega Man Legends 3: Prototype Version&quot; in 2011 for the 3DS eShop, featuring 10 missions, and a new playable character, Barrett. The &quot;Prototype Version&quot; was going to act as a prologue to the forthcoming main game. On July 18, 2011, it was announced that production on &quot;Mega Man Legends 3&quot; was being cancelled, and that neither a full game, nor &quot;Mega Man Legends 3: Prototype Version&quot; would be released, and that there were currently no plans to resume production.

A fan campaign meant to persuade Capcom to continue development on &quot;Mega Man Legends 3&quot; started shortly after its cancellation. 100,000 Strong for Bringing Back Mega Man Legends 3, also known as Get Me Off the Moon, includes sending as many physical letters and e-mails as well as giving as many phone calls to Capcom&#x27;s headquarters as possible, in addition to posting messages on the branch&#x27;s Facebook and Twitter accounts, requesting for a release of the game. The group also advocates using Tanomi.com, a Japanese site that allows people to request a product. 100,000 Strong for Bringing Back Mega Man Legends 3 has been covered by Digital Trends, Destructoid, GamePro, Eurogamer, and the Portuguese gaming website Eurogamer, In addition, Mega Man Legends 3 Project&#x27;s programming director Yoshiyuki Fujikawa has responded favorably to the campaign and &quot;encourages fans to fight for the game to be released.&quot; Capcom themselves has taken notice of the project and the Facebook page and have confirmed that &quot;they were aware of the Facebook group but they would not be changing their plans&quot;, stating, &quot;While Capcom has a built a strong relationship with its community and values their feedback, Mega Man Legends 3 development has officially ceased without plans to resume development.&quot;

<doc id="723830" wikidata="Q56573" url="?curid=723830" title="Sudanese Arabic">
<text>Sudanese Arabic, also referred to as the Sudanese dialect (, ), Colloquial Sudanese ( ) or locally as Common Sudanese ( ) refers to the various related varieties of Arabic spoken in Sudan as well as parts of Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Chad. Sudanese Arabic has also influenced a number of Arabic-based pidgins and creoles, including Juba Arabic, widely used in South Sudan.

Sudanese Arabic is highly diverse. Famed Sudanese linguist Awn ash-Sharif Gasim noted that &quot;it is difficult to speak of a &#x27;Sudanese colloquial language&#x27; in general, simply because there is not a single dialect used simultaneously in all the regions where Arabic is the mother tongue. Every region, and almost every tribe, has its own brand of Arabic.&quot; However, Gasim broadly distinguishes between the varieties spoken by sedentary groups along the Nile (such as the Ja&#x27;aliyyin) and pastoralist groups (such as the Baggara groups of west Sudan). The most widely-spoken variety of Sudanese is variably referred to as Central Sudanese Arabic, Central Urban Sudanese Arabic, or Khartoum Arabic, which more closely resembles varieties spoken by sedentary groups. Some, like researcher Stefano Manfredi, refer to this variety as &quot;Sudanese Standard Arabic&quot; due to the variety&#x27;s comparative prestige and widespread use. Linguist Ibrahim Adam Ishaq identifies two varieties of Arabic spoken in Darfur besides Sudanese Standard Arabic, including Pastoral Arabic and what is generally termed Darfur Arabic, which refers to the Arabic primarily spoken by multilingual Darfuris living in rural parts of the region. A number of especially distinct tribal varieties, such as the Arabic spoken by the Shaigiya and Shukriyya tribes, have also elicited special interest from linguists.

The variety evolved from the varieties of Arabic brought by Arabs who migrated to the region after the signing of the Treaty of Baqt, a 7th-century treaty between the Muslim rulers of Egypt and the Nubian kingdom of Makuria. Testimonies by travelers to the areas that would become modern-day Sudan, like Ibn Battuta, indicate that Arabic coexisted alongside indigenous Sudanese languages, with multilingualism in Arabic and non-Arabic Sudanese languages being well-attested by travelers to the region up until the 19th-century. Sudanese Arabic has characteristics similar to Egyptian Arabic. As a point of difference, though, the Sudanese dialect retains some archaic pronunciation patterns, such as the letter ج, and it also exhibits characteristics of the ancient Nobiin language that once covered the region. Accordingly, linguists have identified a variety of influences from Nubian, Beja, Fur, Nilotic, and other Sudanese languages on the vocabulary and phonology of Sudanese Arabic.

By the 16th and 17th centuries, the Sultanates of Darfur and Sennar emerged and adopted Arabic as an official language, employing the language in public documents and as an intermediary language between the myriad of languages spoken at the time. Under the Sultanate of Sennar, Arabic was also employed in the writing of historical and theological books, most famously &quot;The Tabaqat of the Walis, the Righteous, the &#x27;Ulema and the Poets in the Sudan&quot; () by Muhammad wad Dayf Allah. While the written Arabic used in these Sultanates more closely resembles the norms of Classical Arabic, Dayf Allah&#x27;s book features early attestations of some elements of modern Sudanese phonology and syntax.

Like other varieties of Arabic outside of Modern Standard Arabic, Sudanese Arabic is typically not used in formal writing or on Sudanese news channels. However, Sudanese Arabic is employed extensively on social media and various genres of Sudanese poetry (such as &quot;dobeyt&quot; and &quot;halamanteesh&quot;), as well as in Sudanese cinema and television.

== History ==
In 1889 the &quot;Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute&quot; of Great Britain claimed that the Arabic spoken in Sudan was &quot;a pure but archaic Arabic&quot;. This is related to Sudanese Arabic&#x27;s realization of the Modern Standard Arabic voiceless uvular plosive [q] as the voiced velar stop [g], as is done in Sa&#x27;idi Arabic and other varieties of Sudanic Arabic, as well as Sudanese Arabic&#x27;s realization of the Modern Standard Arabic voiced alveopalatal fricative [dʒ] as the voiced palatal stop [ɟ]. However, Sudanese Arabic also retains the plethora of innovations on Classical Arabic found in other Egypto-Sudanic varieties, such as the loss of interdental fricatives.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
As with other Egypto-Sudanic varieties, Modern Standard Arabic interdental fricatives , , and are substituted by either their fricative or stop counterparts. As is the case in Egyptian Arabic and Levantine Arabic, interdental fricatives are realized as , , and in inherited words, and as , , and in loans from Modern Standard Arabic. Similar to Sa&#x27;idi Arabic, the voiced velar stop corresponds to the Modern Standard Arabic voiced uvular plosive in Sudanese. Gasim also attests to the realization of Modern Standard Arabic as in Sudanese.

Varieties of Sudanese Arabic spoken by non-Arab groups, such as Darfur Arabic, substitute pharyngeal or emphatic consonants with non-pharyngeal counterparts, i.e., for Modern Standard Arabic . The consonants , , and also have a marginal presence in Darfur Arabic and other varieties of Sudanese Arabic in loanwords from indigenous Sudanese languages. Some examples include:

* Darfur Arabic for &quot;baby&quot;
* Darfur Arabic for &quot;talkative&quot;
* Sudanese Arabic for &quot;bed&quot;
* Central Sudanese Arabic for &quot;mew&quot;
* Central Sudanese Arabic for &quot;to be disgusted with&quot;

The Arabic letter maintains an archaic pronunciation in Sudanese (other dialects typically have , or ), while Cairene Arabic has .

=== Vowels ===

The long mid vowels /eː/ and /oː/ are equivalent respectively to the diphthongs [aj] and [aw] found in Modern Standard Arabic.

== Influence from indigenous Sudanese languages ==
Multilingualism in Arabic and indigenous Sudanese languages has been the norm in Sudan since the entry of Arabic into the region, resulting in noticeable influences from Nubian, Beja, western Sudanese, and Nilotic languages on the vocabulary of Sudanese Arabic.

=== Nubian languages ===
Prior to the widespread adoption of Arabic, the Nubian languages were dominant in medieval Sudan, and have thus made a noticeable impact on the lexicon of Sudanese Arabic, particularly on vocabulary relating to agriculture and Nubian foods and traditions. Many of the Nubian influences on Sudanese Arabic hail from the Nobiin language, such as the word for cat, /kadiːsa/, as well as the Nobiin accusative suffix &quot;-ga/ka&quot; which appears in many loanwords of Nubian origin. There is also influence of Nubian in Sudanese Arabic from the Dongolawi language, in particular terms relating to device and water wheel in the form of loanwords like &quot;Kolay&quot;. Other words of Nubian origin identified by researchers include:

* /kudeːk/ &quot;excavation in river bank beneath water-wheel&quot;
* /toːreːg/ &quot;horizontal driving spindle [of a water-wheel]&quot;
* /is.sikaːk/ &quot;beam supporting toreig&quot;
* /gureːr/ &quot;newly formed alluvial soil&quot;
* /iŋgaːja/ &quot;special agricultural plot&quot;
* /waːsuːg/ &quot;a special broad wooden shovel pulled by ropes&quot;
* /koːreːg/ &quot;shovel&quot;
* /weːka/ &quot;okra&quot;
* /maːreːg/ &quot;dura&quot;
* /aːbreː/ &quot;cooked sheets of fermented dura dough&quot;
* /ɟalag/ &quot;an animal similar to the wolf&quot;
* /ʕabalaːnɟ/ &quot;monkey&quot;
* /ʕanbaloːg/ &quot;a young she-goat&quot;
* /ɟirtig/ &quot;a ceremonial occasion on the third night of wedding&quot;
* /suːmaːr/ &quot;public praising of bridegroom&#x27;s uncles&quot;
* /kabareːt/ &quot;special method of perfuming&quot;

=== The Beja language ===
The Beja language, also known as Bidawiyet, is one of Sudan&#x27;s most spoken indigenous languages, and also contributes significantly to the Sudanese Arabic lexicon. Loanwords from Bidawiyet include:

* /ʕaŋgareːb/ &quot;bed&quot;
* /karkab/ &quot;wooden slippers&quot;
* /funduk/ &quot;wooden mortar&quot;
* /daːna/ &quot;pumpkin container&quot;
* /suksuk/ &quot;beads&quot;
* /doːf/ &quot;boneless meat&quot;
* /gangar/ &quot;corn ears&quot;
* /marfaʕiːn/ &quot;wolf&quot;
* /baʕʃuːm/ &quot;fox&quot;

== Regional variation ==
Because of the varying influence of local languages in different parts of Sudan, there is considerable regional variation in Arabic spoken throughout the country. Thus, the term &#x27;Sudanese Arabic&#x27; typically refers to Arabic spoken in northern and central parts of Sudan. The other most commonly mentioned derivative of Sudanese Arabic is Juba Arabic, a pidgin of Arabic spoken in South Sudan, which is much more heavily influenced by other local languages.

== Greetings in Sudanese Arabic ==
In northern Sudan, greetings are typically extended, and involve multiple questions about the other person&#x27;s health, their family etc. When greeting an informal acquaintance, it is common to begin with the word &quot;o&quot;, followed by the person&#x27;s first name: &quot;Ō, Khalafalla&quot; or &quot;Ō, kēf ya Khalafalla&quot;.

Formal greetings often begin with the universal &quot;As-salām ˤalaykom&quot; and the reply, &quot;Wa ˤalaykom as-salām&quot;, an exchange common to Muslims everywhere. However, other greetings typical to Sudan include &quot;Izzēyak&quot; (to men) or &quot; Izzēyik&quot; (to women). A rather informal way to say &quot;How are you&quot;, is &quot;Inta shadīd? Inti shadīda?&quot; &quot;Are you well? (to a male and a female, respectively)&quot;, the response to which is usually &quot;al-Hamdo lillāh&quot; &quot;Praise God&quot; assuming you are indeed feeling well, &quot;ma batal&quot; &quot;not bad&quot; or &quot;nosnos&quot; &quot;half-half&quot;, if feeling only okay or &quot;taˤban showayya&quot; &quot;a little tired&quot; if not so well. Of course, there can be many other responses but these are used in everyday language.

Other everyday greetings include &quot;kwayyis(a), alhamdulilah&quot; &quot;Good, thanks to Allah&quot;, &quot;Kēf al-usra?&quot; &quot;how is the family?&quot; or &quot;kēf al awlād?&quot; &quot;how are the children&quot;. For friends, the question &quot;Kēf?&quot; can also be formed using the person&#x27;s first name, prefixed by &quot;ya&quot;, for example; &quot;kēf ya Yōsif?&quot; &quot;How are you, Joseph?&quot;. Another standard response in addition to &quot;al-hamdu lillāh&quot; is &quot;Allāh ybarik fik&quot; &quot;God&#x27;s blessing upon you&quot;. Additional greetings are appropriate for particular times and are standard in most varieties of Arabic, such as &quot;Sabāh al-khēr? / Sabāh an-Nōr&quot;.

Sudanese that know each other well will often use many of these greetings together, sometimes repeating themselves. It is also common to shake hands on first meeting, sometimes simultaneously slapping or tapping each other on the left shoulder before the handshake (particularly for good friends). Handshakes in Sudan can often last as long as greetings. A handshake between well-acquainted Sudanese will often be preceded by raising one&#x27;s right hand and touching each other&#x27;s left shoulder simultaneously before engaging in the handshake, all while exchanging verbal greetings.

== Assenting - saying yes ==
The Sudanese Arabic word for &quot;yes&quot; varies; &quot;aye&quot; is widely used, although &quot;aywa&quot; or &quot;na‘am&quot; are also commonly used.

<doc id="723838" wikidata="Q673322" url="?curid=723838" title="Chris Heaton-Harris">
<text>Christopher Heaton-Harris (born 28 November 1967) is a British former politician who served in the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from September 2022 to July 2024, and as Chief Whip of the House of Commons and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury from February to September 2022. A member of the Conservative Party, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Daventry from 2010 to 2024.

Born in Epsom, Heaton-Harris attended Tiffin School. He went on to study at Wolverhampton Polytechnic, before working in his family business. He was elected to the European Parliament as MEP for the East Midlands in 1999, and was the Chief Whip of the Conservatives there from 2001 to 2004. He was reelected in the 2004 election before standing down in 2009. After two unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the House of Commons, Heaton-Harris was elected as MP for Daventry in the 2010 general election. He was reelected in both the 2015 and 2017 general election. On the backbenches, he was Chair of the European Research Group from 2010 to 2016.

Heaton-Harris joined the government frontbench in 2017 under Prime Minister Theresa May as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, before serving as Comptroller of the Household Deputy Leader of the House of Commons from January to July 2018. Under May, he later served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from 2018 to 2019. Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he served as Minister of State for Transport from 2019 to 2021 and as Minister of State for Europe from 2021 to 2022. In February 2022, he was appointed to the Cabinet as Chief Whip of the House of Commons and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, and was sworn in as a privy counsellor. After Liz Truss became Prime Minister, Heaton-Harris was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; an office he continued in under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. After serving in parliament for 14 years, Heaton-Harris stood down at the 2024 general election.

==Early life and education==
Born on 28 November 1967, Heaton-Harris attended the Tiffin School in Kingston upon Thames. He attended Wolverhampton Polytechnic, which in 1992 became the University of Wolverhampton.

Heaton-Harris worked for the family business at New Covent Garden Market, before taking over from his father running What4 Ltd for eleven years. At the 1997 general election he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Leicester South. He again unsuccessfully contested the seat in the 2004 Leicester South by-election.

==European Parliament==
Heaton-Harris was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 as MEP for the East Midlands, and was re-elected in 2004. He was the Chief Whip of the Conservatives in the European Parliament from 2001 to March 2004.

Heaton-Harris sat on the Internal Market Committee, responsible for &quot;co-ordination at Community level of national legislation in the sphere of the internal market and of the customs union&quot;, as well as the Central America Delegation and the Bulgaria Delegation.

He was a founding member of the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform, a cross-national, cross-party group of MEPs that campaigns for reforms within the parliament. Its manifesto includes creating one seat for the parliament (in Brussels), cleaning up the system for MEPs&#x27; expenses, and improving debate within the parliament.

Heaton-Harris was responsible for bringing the case of Marta Andreasen, the European Commission&#x27;s Chief Accountant, to public attention in August 2002 and has been involved in fighting fraud, mismanagement and waste within the European Commission and other European institutions.

From May 2006, he sought support within the European Union legislature for a letter to FIFA demanding that the Iranian national football team be thrown out of the 2006 World Cup because of then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s comments about the Holocaust being a lie.

Prior to standing down in 2009, Heaton-Harris was the President of the Sports Intergroup, a group of approximately 40 MEPs who have an interest in sport and sporting issues.

In 2012, Heaton-Harris described himself as a &quot;fierce Eurosceptic&quot;.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1997 general election Heaton-Harris unsuccessfully contested the constituency of Leicester South, finishing second with 23.7% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Jim Marshall He again unsuccessfully contested the seat in the 2004 Leicester South by-election, finishing third with 19.7% of the vote behind the Liberal Democrat Parmjit Singh Gill and Labour&#x27;s Peter Soulsby.

Chris Heaton-Harris was a member of the Conservative A-List and was selected to succeed Tim Boswell as candidate for the safe Conservative constituency of Daventry in June 2006. He was elected as MP for Daventry at the 2010 general election with a majority of 19,188 and 56.5% of the vote.

On 18 May 2024, he announced that he would not seek re-election as an MP at the 2024 general election.

===Backbencher===
In March 2012, Heaton-Harris was reported as being one of the Conservative MPs to have spoken critically of Party Co-Chairman Sayeeda Warsi at a meeting of the 1922 Committee, following Warsi&#x27;s handling of Roger Helmer MEP&#x27;s defection to UKIP.

===Ministerial career===
At the 2015 general election, Heaton-Harris was re-elected with an increased vote share of 58.2% and an increased majority 21,059. At the snap 2017 general election he was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 63.7% and an increased majority of 21,734.

Heaton-Harris was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, a whips office sinecure, on 15 July 2017. He was promoted to Deputy Leader of the House of Commons and Comptroller of the Household on 9 January 2018.

After the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary and the following resignations of several Conservative ministers on 9 July 2018, Heaton-Harris was appointed as one of three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union. He resigned from this position to support Andrea Leadsom&#x27;s second Conservative leadership bid, which she lost to Boris Johnson.

On 25 July 2019, he was appointed by Johnson as the Minister of State for Transport.

At the 2019 general election, Heaton-Harris was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 64.6% and an increased majority of 26,080.

He was appointed Minister of State for Europe on 19 December 2021 when ministerial responsibility for Europe was transferred out of the Cabinet Office and to the Foreign Office. In February 2022, he was appointed by Johnson as Chief Whip of the Conservative Party and was subsequently sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.

Following Liz Truss&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister in September 2022, he was promoted to Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. On 8 September he made his first visit to Northern Ireland. He was retained in position by Rishi Sunak when Sunak became Prime Minister on 25 October 2022. He was Secretary of State during the negotiation of the 2023 Windsor Framework.

=== Hospitality ===
Heaton-Harris accepted tickets for himself and his family to attend four events at the London 2012 Olympics relating to swimming, diving, gymnastics, and the closing ceremony, as a gift from Coca-Cola. The value of the gifts (£11,750) was the highest amount received by any MP. He declared them in the Register of Members&#x27; Interests. Heaton-Harris was one of several MPs, including Labour&#x27;s shadow whip Mark Tami, who received tickets worth £1,961 to the England v Germany game at the 2020 UEFA European Football Championship from Power Leisure Bookmakers.

=== Climate change ===
In November 2012, covert video footage of Heaton-Harris discussing the role of James Delingpole in the Corby by-election were published on the website of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The recording, made by Greenpeace, appeared to show the MP&#x27;s support for Delingpole&#x27;s independent, anti-windfarm candidacy, at a time when Heaton-Harris was engaged by the Conservatives to run the unsuccessful campaign of their own candidate, Christine Emmett.

Heaton-Harris indicated that this was linked to a plan by core members of the Conservative Party to emasculate the Climate Change Act by making its commitments advisory rather than mandatory. After Heaton-Harris apologised for the impression he gave in the video, Home Secretary Theresa May said he was guilty only of silly bragging, while Labour&#x27;s Michael Dugher MP urged Prime Minister David Cameron to show leadership and punish him. The Corby by-election was subsequently lost by the Conservatives with a swing to Labour of 12.8 per cent.

=== Letters to universities ===
In October 2017, Heaton-Harris, a Eurosceptic, wrote to the vice-chancellors of every university in the UK, requesting the names of academics lecturing on Brexit and copies of all course material, leading to claims of political interference in academic freedom, as well as censorship. The move was described as &quot;McCarthyite&quot; by Professor Kevin Featherstone, head of the European Institute at the London School of Economics, and &quot;sinister&quot; by Professor David Green, the vice-Chancellor of Worcester University who likened it to Newspeak and the Thought Police from George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four.&quot; The Dean of Durham Law School, Thom Brooks, called it &quot;dog whistle politics at its worst&quot;, while Lord Patten, Chancellor of Oxford University, called the letter an act of &quot;idiotic and offensive Leninism&quot;. In addition, the letter attracted criticism from both pro-Remain and pro-Leave academics at Cambridge and London&#x27;s Queen Mary universities, and a rebuke from Downing Street.

Responding the next day to the widespread criticism from both politicians and academics, universities minister Jo Johnson suggested that Heaton-Harris might have been researching a possible book on &quot;the evolution of attitudes&quot; to Europe, rather than acting in his role as a government minister, and &quot;probably didn&#x27;t appreciate the degree to which (the letter) would be misinterpreted&quot;, although there was no mention of any research for a possible book in the original letter. On 17 February 2019, Heaton-Harris said that there had never been any plans for a book.

=== European Research Group ===
Heaton-Harris chaired the European Research Group (ERG), a group of Eurosceptic MPs, from 2010 until November 2016. Subscriptions totalling £13,850 were claimed as a parliamentary expense. At the same time he sat on the wide-ranging powers of the European Scrutiny Committee, set up to assess the legal and/or political importance of draft EU legislation.

Documents from the House of Commons catering department released via Freedom of Information to openDemocracy, show Heaton-Harris hosted an ERG breakfast meeting in October 2017, despite taking over as a government whip in July 2016. Continuing to chair the group while he was a member of the government led to an accusation of violating the Ministerial Code, section 7.12 of which states: &quot;Ministers should take care to ensure that they do not become associated with non-public organisations whose objectives may in any degree conflict with Government policy and thus give rise to a conflict of interest.&quot; However, a government spokesperson stated that they did not view it as a breach.

==Personal life==
Heaton-Harris is married and has two children. He is a qualified football referee.

== Honours ==
He was sworn in as a member of Her Majesty&#x27;s Most Honourable Privy Council on 16 February 2022 at Windsor Castle. This gave him the honorific prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

<text>pax is an archiving utility available for various operating systems and defined since 1995. Rather than sort out the incompatible options that have crept up between codice_1 and codice_2, along with their implementations across various versions of Unix, the IEEE designed a new archive utility pax that could support various archive formats with useful options from both archivers. The codice_3 command is available on Unix and Unix-like operating systems and on IBM i, and Microsoft Windows NT until Windows 2000.

In 2001, IEEE defined a new &quot;pax&quot; format which is basically &quot;tar&quot; with additional extended attributes. The format is not supported by pax commands in most Linux distributions and in FreeBSD, but it is supported by tar commands from GNU and FreeBSD; the format is further supported by pax commands in AIX, Solaris and HP-UX.

The name &quot;pax&quot; is an acronym for &quot;portable archive exchange&quot;, but is also an allusion to the Latin word for &quot;peace&quot;; the command invocation and structure represents somewhat of a peaceful unification of both codice_4 and codice_5.

== History ==
The first public implementation of pax was written by Mark H. Colburn in 1989. Colburn posted it to as &quot;Usenix/IEEE POSIX replacement for TAR and CPIO&quot;. Manual pages for pax on HP-UX, IRIX, and SCO UNIX attribute pax to Colburn.

As early as POSIX.2 draft 10 from July 1990 covers &quot;pax&quot; command. Furthermore, POSIX.2 and IEEE 1003.1b drafts in 1991 cover &quot;pax&quot; command, featuring cpio and ustar archive formats.

Another version of the pax program was created by Keith Muller in 1992–1993. The version first appeared in 4.4BSD (1995). Pax command appeared in X/Open issue 4 (Single Unix Specification version 1) in 1995, featuring cpio and ustar archive formats, which were also the only two formats featuring in the 1997 Single Unix Specification.

In 1997, Sun Microsystems proposed a method for adding extensions to the ustar format. This method was accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard as the new &quot;pax&quot; file format. The POSIX specification for the utility was updated to include this format.

== Features ==

=== Modes ===
pax has four general modes that are invoked by a combination of the (&quot;read&quot;) and (&quot;write&quot;) options.

This table summarizes the modal behaviour: 
This model is similar to cpio, which has a similar set of basic operations.

==== Examples ====
List contents of an archive:
Extract contents of an archive into the current directory:
Create an archive of the current directory:

Copy current directory tree to another location:

(The target directory must exist beforehand!)

=== Command invocation ===
By default, pax uses the standard input/output for archive and listing operations. This can be changed with the &quot;tar-style&quot; option that specifies the archive file. Pax differs from cpio by recursively considering the content of a directory; to disable this behavior, POSIX pax has an option to disable it.

The command is a mish-mash of and features. Like , processes directory entries recursively, a feature that can be disabled with for cpio-style behavior. The handling of file input/outputs is also a mix: when a list of file names is specified on the command line, they are taken as shell globs for file input or listing (tar-like); otherwise takes the -style behavior of using the standard input for a file list. Finally, supports reading/writing to a named archive file using tar&#x27;s option.

For example, if one desires a cpio-style archiving of the current directory, can be used with just like one does using cpio:

(This construct is pointless without any filters for , as it becomes identical to the above example.)

The command for extracting the contents for an archive is the same as :

It is possible to invoke these commands in a codice_4-like syntax as well:
=== Compression ===
Most implementations of pax use the (gzip) and (bzip2) switches for compression; this feature however, is not specified by POSIX. It is important to note that pax cannot append to compressed archives.
Example for extracting a gzipped archive:
As in tar and cpio, pax output can be piped to another compressor/decompressor program. As an example xz is used here:

and listing an xz-compressed archive as the input:
=== Format support ===
POSIX.1-2001 requires that &quot;pax&quot; command supports the archive formats cpio, ustar and pax at a minimum.

The versions of &quot;pax&quot; command that stem from the 4.4BSD implementation usually inherit the formats supported by that version, selectable via the option:
* cpio – The extended cpio interchange format specified in the IEEE Std 1003.2 (&quot;POSIX.2&quot;) standard.
* bcpio – The old binary cpio format.
* sv4cpio – The System V release 4 cpio.
* sv4crc – The System V release 4 cpio with file crc checksums.
* tar – The old BSD tar format as found in BSD4.3.
* ustar &quot;(default)&quot; – The tar interchange format specified in the IEEE Std 1003.2 (&quot;POSIX.2&quot;) standard.

The POSIX.1-2001 &quot;pax&quot; format is not supported by this BSD version of &quot;pax&quot; command. The format is not supported on most Linux distributions (whose &quot;pax&quot; command is from the MirBSD branch of &quot;MirCPIO-paxmirabilis&quot;) and on FreeBSD. The format is supported by &quot;pax&quot; command in AIX, Solaris and HP-UX. It is further supported by Python tarfile module, by BSD-licensed libarchive, by 7-ZIP and further by GNU tar and FreeBSD tar. The Heirloom Project pax command, developed by Gunnar Ritter in 2003, supports the &quot;pax&quot; format as well as many extra formats.

=== Multiple volumes ===
pax supports archiving on multiple volumes. When the end of a volume is reached, the following message appears:

$ pax -wf /dev/fd0 .
ATTENTION! pax archive volume change required.
/dev/fd0 ready for archive volume: 2
Load the NEXT STORAGE MEDIA (if required) and make sure it is WRITE ENABLED.
Type &quot;y&quot; to continue, &quot;.&quot; to quit pax, or &quot;s&quot; to switch to new device.
If you cannot change storage media, type &quot;s&quot;
Is the device ready and online? &gt;
When restoring an archive from multiple media, pax asks for the next media in the same fashion, when the end of the media is reached before the end of the archive.

== Standardization, reception and popularity ==
Despite being standardized in 2001 by IEEE, as of 2010, pax enjoys relatively little popularity or adoption. This is in part because there was not any need for it from the Unix users; it was just the POSIX committee that wants to have a more consistent interface. Pax is also fairly chatty and expects user interactions when things go wrong.

pax is required to be present in all conformant systems by Linux Standard Base since version 3.0 (released on July 6, 2005), but so far few Linux distributions ship and install it by default. However, most distributions include pax as a separately installable package.

pax has also been present in Windows NT, where it is limited to file archives (tapes not supported). It was later moved to the Interix subsystem. It does not support archiving or restoring Win32 ACLs. pax was further present in Windows 2000.

Packages handled by the Installer (macOS) often carry the bulk of their contents in an Archive.pax.gz file that may be read using the system&#x27;s pax (heirloom) utility.

<doc id="723846" wikidata="Q177536" url="?curid=723846" title="Roger Helmer">
<text>Roger Helmer (born 25 January 1944) is a British politician and businessman. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East Midlands region from 1999 to 2017. Before becoming an MEP, he was a business executive.

Helmer was elected to the European Parliament in 1999, 2004, and 2009 as a member of the Conservative Party and in 2014 as a member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), having defected from the Conservatives to UKIP in March 2012. He has described himself as a eurosceptic and is a supporter of the Better Off Out campaign.

==Background==
Born in London, Helmer attended King Edward VI School, Southampton on a state scholarship (1955–62). He read mathematics at Churchill College, Cambridge, graduating in 1965 with a B.A., subsequently upgraded to an M.A. (Cantab) as per tradition.

He began his business career in that year with Procter &amp; Gamble in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, going on to hold senior marketing and general management appointments in a range of companies, including Reader&#x27;s Digest, National Semiconductor, Coats Viyella and United Distillers. During his business career he lived and worked in various countries.

==Political career==
===Conservative===

In September 1998, following his selection as a candidate for the Conservative Party in the East Midlands, Helmer left his job as managing director of a Leicester textile company, Donisthorpe Ltd (the UK subsidiary of a French textile multinational), to campaign full-time ahead of the 1999 euro-elections, and took up his new role as an MEP immediately after his election.

He was re-elected as a Conservative MEP for the East Midlands Region in 2004.
He was suspended from the Conservative Party whip on 26 May 2005 after voting against party instructions on a motion to censure the European Commission and openly criticising his delegation leader, Timothy Kirkhope, in a parliamentary debate; the Conservative party whip was restored on 13 September 2006, but he remained &quot;Non-Inscrit&quot;. He joined the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), with the other Conservative MEPs, in July 2009.

Having initially advocated the Conservative policy of renegotiating the EU treaties, since 2006 he has been a supporter of the Better Off Out campaign, calling for the UK to leave the EU.

He was appointed Adam Smith Scholar in 2005 by the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

He became chairman of the libertarian pressure group, The Freedom Association, in April 2007.

In November 2009 he stepped down as the Conservative party&#x27;s spokesman on employment in the European parliament because he thought the Conservatives&#x27; new policy on not supporting a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty was &quot;confused&quot; and &quot;essentially cosmetic&quot;.

===UKIP===
On 12 October 2011, Helmer announced that he would resign from the European Parliament at the end of the year, citing &quot;increasing disillusion with the attitudes of the Conservative Party&quot; as the main reason, although also stating that his &quot;twelve-and-a-half years banging my head against the same brick wall in Brussels is perhaps long enough&quot;.

Helmer expected to be replaced by Rupert Matthews who was next on the Conservative party list in the 2009 European Parliament election. However the party was reported to be looking into golliwog dolls featuring on the front cover of a book published by a company of which Matthews is director and shareholder and would not confirm that Matthews would succeed him.

Helmer delayed standing down, before it was announced on 2 March 2012 that he had defected from the Conservatives to the UK Independence Party. He faced accusations of hypocrisy as he had demanded in November 2000, that MEP Bill Newton Dunn immediately resign as a result of his move from Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats.

On 6 April 2014, Helmer visited the congress of Conservative People&#x27;s Party of Estonia in Tallinn and gave a speech in support of Euroscepticism in Estonia.

On 6 May 2014 it was announced on the official UKIP website that Helmer would contest the Newark by-election, following the resignation of former Conservative MP Patrick Mercer. He came second with 25%, behind the Conservative Robert Jenrick who received 45% of the vote.

On 25 May 2014, he was re-elected for UKIP as the first on their list for the East Midlands seat in the 2014 European Elections.

On 13 June 2017, Helmer announced he would be resigning from the European Parliament, citing age and health status as reasons, but amid allegations of misuse of public funds. He was succeeded by Jonathan Bullock.

==Views==
===Rape stance===
In May 2011, Helmer supported Ken Clarke&#x27;s comments on reduced prison sentences for rape by comparing stranger rape and date rape. He said: &quot;Let me make another point which will certainly get me vilified, but which I think is important to make: while in the first case, the blame is squarely on the perpetrator and does not attach to the victim, in the second case the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend&#x27;s mind.&quot; His comments were criticised by East Midlands politicians Bill Newton-Dunn and Nigel Mills though Helmer refused to change what he had said.

===Views on sexuality===
On 19 July 2009, on his blog, Helmer defended the Polish Law and Justice MEP, and chairman of the ECR, Michał Kamiński from accusations of homophobia. He went on to write that homophobia does not exist and that the word: &quot;is merely a propaganda device&quot; designed to &quot;denigrate and stigmatise those holding conventional opinions.&quot;

On 11 August 2009, Helmer defended himself against criticism of comments he had made, saying he was not claiming &quot;that there is no discrimination, and that homosexuals do not suffer violence and prejudice from people because sadly, we all know that is not the case.&quot; but rather, he states, that the word homophobia has &quot;no meaning&quot; because he has &quot;never met anyone with an irrational fear of homosexuals&quot; and claims that the term is a propagandist one created by the &quot;militant gay rights lobby.&quot;

In March 2012, Helmer spoke out in support of Cardinal Keith O&#x27;Brien, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, who had earlier condemned the government&#x27;s plans to introduce same-sex marriage as a &quot;grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right.&quot; Although he had formerly been critical of the Roman Catholic Church, labelling it &quot;systematically paedophile&quot;, Helmer praised O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s statement, opining that &quot;Christian moral principles are not a bad basis for a free and fair society&quot;. He furthermore commented that &quot;once you start to tamper with the institution of marriage, you get into some very murky water indeed&quot;, and that such a move could set a precedent that would lead to the legalisation of communal marriage and incest.

Following accusations of homophobia, UKIP leader Nigel Farage confirmed that Helmer had relaxed his views on homosexuality in recent years, describing him as &quot;somebody of 70 years of age who grew up with a strong Christian Bible background. He grew up in an age when homosexuality was actually imprisonable, and he had a certain set of views which he maintained for many years which he now says he accepts the world&#x27;s moved on and he&#x27;s relaxed about.&quot;

Ahead of the 2014 Newark by-election, Helmer gave an interview to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, in which he said the NHS should fund the discredited gay conversion therapy, comparing it to sex-changes and homeopathy. He later told &quot;The Independent&quot; that his views had been misrepresented by the paper&#x27;s editor.

====Use of massage parlour====
In October 2014, Helmer was photographed visiting a &quot;sleazy massage parlour&quot; in Lutterworth. He told &quot;The Sun&quot; &quot;MEPs are entitled to a private life. I work extremely hard and when I do occasionally have time off I enjoy a massage.&quot; The following day he confirmed the story, telling the &quot;Derby Telegraph&quot; that &quot;I think &quot;The Sun&quot; quoted me quite well and I don&#x27;t have anything to add to that.

===Expenses===
Helmer was criticised in an article in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; on 10 February 2010 regarding MEPs&#x27; pensions. The article by Bruno Waterfield criticised an attempt by Helmer and other Conservative MEPs to water down attempts to overhaul their expenses arrangements. Helmer replied, in a letter to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; printed on 13 February 2010, that accusations relating to protecting his pension rights, protecting his anonymity and seeking further public funding for pension contributions were false.

Following these accusations, Helmer made his MEP allowances available to view online. According to a June 2014 &quot;Guardian&quot; article, all three main UK parties expect their MEPs to provide an independent audit to verify expenses though this is not an EU requirement.

===The NHS===
In August 2009, whilst a Conservative MEP, Helmer supported his fellow MEP Daniel Hannan&#x27;s criticism of the NHS -described as a &quot;60-year mistake&quot;. Speaking to BBC Radio 4&#x27;s PM programme, Helmer stated that: &quot;I think Dan has done us a service by raising these issues which need to be looked at. If 80% of Americans are getting better health care than we are in the UK then we ought to ask why, and we ought to ask how are we going to deliver equally good results.&quot; The attacks by Helmer and Hannan led Conservative leader David Cameron to release a statement to the BBC saying: &quot;The Conservative Party stands four square behind the NHS&quot;.

===The environment===
In April 2004, whilst a Conservative MEP, Helmer was criticised by Friends of the Earth for his voting record on environmental issues, voting in what they claimed was an environmentally friendly manner in only one out of ten possible &quot;eco-friendly&quot; votes.

In a letter to the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; on 16 November 2009, Helmer accused the Church of England of having &quot;abandoned religious faith entirely and taken up the religion of climate alarmism instead.&quot; This was in response to a recent inter-faith event in Leicester concerning the challenge of climate change. In response, the Bishop of Leicester, Tim Stevens, said Helmer had not aired these views when he debated climate change in Leicester cathedral and asked whether &quot;this was merely courtesy, or was it because the opportunity for a platform meant more to him than exposing his views to scrutiny or challenge from a live audience.&quot;

In December 2010, still as a Conservative MEP, Helmer attended the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference and spent EU funds on a billboard campaign in his constituency criticising climate change policy. Journalist Leo Hickman, blogging for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, questioned who was funding his attendance at the conference after it was confirmed that he was not there in an official capacity representing the EU or the Conservative Party – who both confirmed that they did not share Helmer&#x27;s beliefs on the subject of climate change.
Within his local region, Helmer was criticised by academics from the University of Derby and the University of Northampton for being &quot;out of step with the overwhelming scientific evidence on the subject of human induced climate change.&quot; Helmer welcomed the discovery by the British Geological Survey of rich deposits of shale gas under Melton and the Vale of Belvoir pointing to successful extraction in the US despite &quot;horror stories circulated by green lobbyists.&quot;

===Hunting===
In 2009, Helmer said he would support the repeal of the hunting ban, and said that he used to enjoy hare coursing.

==Works==
Helmer has published three books. The first two were on European issues, &quot;Straight Talking on Europe&quot; in 2000, and &quot;A Declaration of Independence&quot; in 2002. A third book &quot;Sceptic at Large&quot; on a wider range of topics was published in 2011 by Bretwalda Books.

<doc id="723852" wikidata="Q1718672" url="?curid=723852" title="Order of the New Templars">
<text>The Order of the New Templars – &quot;Ordo Novi Templi&quot; was a proto-fascist secret society in Germany founded by Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels (the code name of Fascist agitator Adolf Joseph Lanz) in 1900. Lanz used this order to spread his ideas, which he initially referred to as &quot;theozoology&quot; or &quot;Ario-Christianity&quot; and from 1915 as &quot;Ariosophy&quot;. The order combined esoteric piety with concepts of racial &quot;science&quot; and eugenics, which were modern at the time. It was modelled after the Catholic military order of the Knights Templar and was similar in its hierarchical structure to the Order of Cistercians which had trained the New Templars founder, Adolf Lanz.

Lanz&#x27;s goal was to bring right-wing extremists in post-World War I Germany together and mobilise them in opposition to liberal society. Members used code names to hinder any chance of betrayals. The order would later provide support to the rise of Nazism.

Lanz was the ideologist and political agitator of the group, justifying violence by punishments such as castration in order to establish Fascism in Germany and defend it against communism. Lanz intended the organization to put an end to the racial conflict between the supposedly higher-bred &quot;master class&quot; and lower-bred &quot;animal people&quot; and to enforce it by force &quot;up to the castration knife&quot; (Lanz). Lanz&#x27;s ideas should allow the upper class and imperialist groups to justify &quot;any exploitation&quot;. Specifically, &quot;the enslavement&quot; of the population was to be reintroduced and this rule by &quot;the emasculation&quot; of be enforced by those who think differently. Women should be called &quot;slaves&quot; and &quot;breeding mothers&quot; serve.

The right-wing extremist and anti-Semite Nivard Schlögl trained and radicalized Lanz. Lanz had left the Cistercian order shortly before and tied the naming of his own order to the medieval Templar Order. His interest in the Templars was awakened by the contemporary popular motif of the Knights of the Grail in the neo-romantic music and literature of Richard Wagner, Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer, and Friedrich Lienhard. In addition, the Templars were closely connected with the Cistercians; Bernhard von Clairvaux, the founder of the Cistercian order, had also written the monastic rules of the Templars and later praised them for their use in the crusades.

Around the time of his order&#x27;s founding, Lanz developed into a determined racist, who saw in the Aryans as the supreme race, which since time immemorial has been in a defensive struggle against lower races. Against this background, he conceived the idea that the Templars had the goal of establishing an Aryan empire across the entire Mediterranean area. He interpreted the persecution of the Templars from 1312 as a triumph of racially inferior people whose aim was to undermine the rule and purity of the Aryan race. In addition, he was convinced that the Catholic Church had been suppressing true Christian teaching since that time, as the core of which he regarded his ideas of a racial struggle. He therefore saw his own order as a new beginning of the crusade against lower races that had been interrupted for centuries.

In 1907 Lanz acquired the ruins of the small Werfenstein Castle near Grein in Upper Austria as the priory of the Order. In the same year he published a program of the Order, in which he described it as an association of Aryans whose aims were to promote racial consciousness through genealogical and heraldic research, beauty pageants, and to promote the establishment of racially exemplary states in underdeveloped regions of the world. For the order he developed his own liturgy and ceremonies. The rules of the order stipulated that only blonde and blue-eyed men were allowed to join, who also had to meet other Aryan criteria, which Lanz described in his series of publications &quot;Ostara&quot;. A hierarchy was established within the order based on (supposed) racial purity. On Christmas Day 1907, Lanz hoisted two flags on the tower of his Order&#x27;s headquarters: one with the coat of arms of the von Liebenfels family, an aristocratic family that presumably died out around 1790 and that he claimed to be descendants of, and one with a swastika, which was already a popular Volkish symbol.

From 1908, public festivals were held at Werfenstein. Several hundred guests traveled by steamboat on the Danube, where the castle is located, and were greeted with cannon shots, after which they celebrated extensively in the castle courtyard. This found great resonance in the national press and stimulated interest in Lanz&#x27;s publications.

Lanz continued to work on the ceremonies and composed devotional songs and verses. The castle was decorated with solemn representations of Hugues de Payens, the first Grand Master of the Templars, and with representations of the &quot;monkeys&quot; who, in his theozoology, were regarded as the origin of the lower races. In 1915 and 1916 a &quot;New Templar Breviary&quot; was published in two parts, which Lanz had written with other friars. It contained psalms and hymns that drew on Christian tradition but supplicated Christ to redeem the Aryan race and wipe out the lower races.

Their symbol was a yellow flag with a swastika and four fleurs-de-lys. The golden background symbolized eternity, the lilies racial purity, and the red swastika the rising Aryan hero.

<doc id="723853" wikidata="Q4116028" url="?curid=723853" title="Christopher Beazley">
<text>Christopher Beazley (born 5 September 1952) is a British politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1984 to 1994 and again from 1999 to 2009. He was member of the Conservative Party until 2019, when he joined the Liberal Democrats.

==Background==
Beazley is the son of Peter Beazley, and earned a BA in History at the University of Bristol in 1974. From 1974 to 1976, he worked at the Bank of England, then as a teacher 1976–1983 and as a research officer at the University of Sussex 1983–1984. He has since been a consultant and writer on European affairs.

==Political career==

Beazley was elected at the 1984 European Parliament election as the MEP for Cornwall and Plymouth, serving alongside his father Peter Beazley, who was the MEP for Bedfordshire South. He was re-elected in 1989, but when his constituency was abolished at the 1994 European Parliament election, he was defeated in the new Cornwall and West Plymouth constituency by the Liberal Democrat candidate Robin Teverson.

He returned to the European Parliament at the 1999 European election 1999 to 2009, when the single-member constituencies were replaced by regional constituencies using a party list form of election. He was elected as an MEP for the East of England, and re-elected in 2004. He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

He has been the Conservative spokesman on Culture and Education, Regional Development, Home Affairs and Justice, and Constitutional Affairs.

A centrist conservative, he has been vice-chairman of the Conservative Group for Europe, and has criticised the UK Conservative Party of leaving the European People&#x27;s Party group.

A few months before he left the European Parliament in 2009, he became a full member of the European People&#x27;s Party, despite the UK Conservative Party&#x27;s plans to withdraw from their parliament group, saying, &quot;I cannot watch and say nothing while the Tories walk away from their allies, friends and colleagues in Europe.&quot;

==Positions==
Beazley is a signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.

== Quote ==
* &quot;Europe is no more divided, but we are still divided by our experience.&quot;–Christopher Beazley, Prague, June 2008, in his speech at the conference &quot;Conscience of Europe and Communism&quot; &quot;(Svědomí Evropy a komunismus)&quot; closing with the Prague Declaration &quot;(Pražská deklarace)&quot;

<doc id="723859" wikidata="Q1611466" url="?curid=723859" title="Pioneer Venus Multiprobe">
<text>The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe, also known as Pioneer Venus 2 or Pioneer 13, was a spacecraft launched in 1978 to explore Venus as part of NASA&#x27;s Pioneer program. This part of the mission included a spacecraft bus which was launched from Earth. The bus carried one large and three smaller probes, which, after separating, each penetrated the Venusian atmosphere at a different location, returning data as they descended into the planet&#x27;s thick atmosphere. The entries occurred on December 9, 1978.

==In context==
There was also an orbiter launched in 1978, part of the overall Pioneer Venus project along with this entry probe mission. Whereas the probes entered the atmosphere in 1978, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter would stay in orbit throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s. The next major mission was the &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft, which was an orbiter capable of mapping Venus by seeing through its opaque clouds with radar.

== Spacecraft ==

The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe bus was constructed by the Hughes Aircraft Company, built around the HS-507 bus. It was cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of and a mass of . Unlike the probes, which did not begin making direct measurements until they had decelerated lower in the atmosphere, the bus returned data on Venus&#x27; upper atmosphere.

The bus was targeted to enter the Venusian atmosphere at a shallow entry angle and transmit data until destruction by the heat of atmospheric friction. The objective was to study the structure and composition of the atmosphere down to the surface, the nature and composition of the clouds, the radiation field and energy exchange in the lower atmosphere, and local information on atmospheric circulation patterns. With no heat shield or parachute, the bus made upper atmospheric measurements with two instruments:

* BIMS – an ion mass spectrometer to determine the origin and long-term development of the Venusian atmosphere, the dynamics of the upper atmosphere layers, its energy balance and the effect of solar radiation and interplanetary space on those layers. This instrument had a range of 1 to 46 u, used 6 W of power and weighed .
* BNMS – a neutral mass spectrometer. This made measurements of the interaction between the solar wind and Venus, the photochemistry of the upper layers of and heat distribution in the Venusian atmosphere. It had a range of 1 to 60 u, weighed , and used ~1 W of power.

The spacecraft operated down to an altitude of about before disintegrating.

== Probes ==
The spacecraft carried one large and three small atmospheric probes, designed by Senior Scientist and Program Manager Irwin Baker of Hughes Aircraft Company, to collect data as they descended into the atmosphere of Venus. The probes did not carry photographic instruments, and were not designed to survive landing – the smaller probes were not equipped with parachutes, and the larger probe&#x27;s parachute was expected to detach as it neared the ground. All four probes continued transmitting data until impact; however, one survived and continued to transmit data from the surface.

=== Large probe ===

The large probe carried seven experiments, contained within a sealed spherical pressure vessel. The science experiments were:
* LNMS – neutral mass spectrometer to measure the atmospheric composition
* LGC – gas chromatograph to measure the atmospheric composition
* LSFR – solar flux radiometer to measure solar flux penetration in the atmosphere
* LIR – infrared radiometer to measure distribution of infrared radiation
* LCPS – cloud particle size spectrometer to measure particle size and shape
* LN – nephelometer to search for cloud particles
* temperature, pressure, and acceleration sensors

This pressure vessel was encased in a nose cone and aft protective cover. After deceleration from initial atmospheric entry at about near the equator on the night side of Venus, a parachute was deployed at altitude. The large probe was about in diameter and the pressure vessel itself was in diameter.

=== Small probes ===


Three identical small probes, around in diameter, were deployed. These probes consisted of spherical pressure vessels surrounded by an aeroshell, but unlike the large probe, they had no parachutes and the aeroshells did not separate from the probes.

The science experiments were:
* a neutral mass spectrometer to measure the atmospheric composition
* a gas chromatograph to measure the atmospheric composition
* SNFR – solar flux radiometer to measure solar flux penetration in the atmosphere
* an infrared radiometer to measure distribution of infrared radiation
* MTUR – cloud particle size spectrometer to measure particle size and shape
* SN – nephelometer to search for cloud particles
* SAS – temperature, pressure, and acceleration sensors

The radio signals from all four probes were also used to characterize the winds, turbulence, and propagation in the atmosphere. The small probes were each targeted at different parts of the planet and were named accordingly.
* The North probe entered the atmosphere at about 60 degrees north latitude on the day side.
* The Night probe entered on the night side.
* The Day probe entered well into the day side, and was the only one of the four probes which continued to send radio signals back after impact, for over an hour.

== Launch ==
The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe was launched by an Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR rocket, which flew from Launch Complex 36A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 07:33 on August 8, 1978, and deployed the Multiprobe into heliocentric orbit for its coast to Venus.

== Arrival at Venus ==
Prior to the Multiprobe reaching Venus, the four probes were deployed from the main bus. The large probe was released on November 16, 1978, and the three small probes on November 20.

All four probes and the bus reached Venus on December 9, 1978. The large probe was the first to enter the atmosphere, at 18:45:32 UTC, followed over the next 11 minutes by the other three probes. The bus entered the atmosphere at 20:21:52 UTC and returned its last signal at 20:22:55 from an altitude of .

The four probes transmitted data until they impacted the surface of Venus. The Day Probe survived the impact, returning data from the surface for 67 minutes and 37 seconds after reaching the surface.

== Scientific results ==

Below an altitude of the temperatures measured by the four probes were identical to within a few degrees, between on the surface; the ground pressure, between . Nephelometers identified three cloud layers with different characteristics. The most remarkable discovery was that the ratio of 36argon / 40argon isotopes was much higher than in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which seems to indicate that the genesis of the Venusian atmosphere is very different from that of Earth&#x27;s. The reconstituted trajectory of the atmospheric probes determined that the wind averaged in the middle cloud layer, at the base of these clouds and just on the ground. Overall data from airborne sensors confirmed and refined the data obtained by the Soviet Venera program that preceded the American mission to Venus.

<doc id="723879" wikidata="Q1839684" url="?curid=723879" title="Blackheart">
<text>Blackheart is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an adversary to the superhero Ghost Rider. Created by writer Ann Nocenti and artist John Romita Jr., Blackheart first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #270 (September 1989).

The character has also appeared in other media, such as the 2000 video game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot; and in the 2007 film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actor Wes Bentley.

== Publication history ==

The character was created by Ann Nocenti and John Romita Jr. and first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #270 (September 1989).

== Fictional character biography ==
Centuries of murder in a locale named Christ&#x27;s Crown, New York, draws the attention of a Hell-lord, Mephisto, who creates a &quot;son,&quot; Blackheart, from evil energy. Blackheart explores the nature of evil under his father&#x27;s tutelage, clashing with and failing to corrupt Daredevil and Spider-Man. Mephisto draws Daredevil, Brandy Ash, the genetically engineered Number Nine and the Inhumans Gorgon, Karnak, and Ahura into Hell, where Blackheart tries to tempt them. However, he is impressed by humanity&#x27;s free will and concludes that evil cannot hope to win out against good. When Mephisto learns of Blackheart&#x27;s change of mind, he banishes him to Earth, warning him that if he ever uses his power again, he will be driven mad.

Later, in an attempt to be free of captivity, Blackheart makes contact with Misha from the group Warheads and becomes the source of her pre-cognitive visions. Eventually Misha&#x27;s squad, Kether Troop, invades Hell itself and frees Blackheart, who was temporarily in disguise.

Blackheart returns to Christ&#x27;s Crown and lures Ghost Rider, Punisher, and Wolverine to the town, hoping to recruit them in his war against Mephisto. When they all refuse, Blackheart brainwashes the entire town and kidnaps a young girl all three men had befriended. The group follows Blackheart and the girl back into his own realm and defeats him. As Mephisto forewarned, the usage of his powers in this attempt drives him to madness. He again attempts to commission the services of the three heroes; however, he is shut down by the Ghost Rider who deems him no better than his father. Unexpectedly, the young girl runs to the defeated Blackheart and offers him forgiveness. Not knowing how to respond, Blackheart lies on the ground as he weeps. It is later revealed that Blackheart did not actually need her, just her blood, when Mephisto appears to him offering his aid in defeating them. Brandishing a dagger tipped in a small portion of her blood, Blackheart claims he has fulfilled a prophecy as he plunges the dagger into Mephisto; supposedly destroying him. Blackheart is then shown having taken over his portion of Hell.

Alongside the Grim Reaper, Blackheart brings Wonder Man to Mephisto&#x27;s realm to battle Mephisto.

Blackheart creates a group of Spirits of Vengeance to oppose the Ghost Rider, Noble Kale. Blackheart tricks Kale and tries to make him as a member of his group of Spirits of Vengeance, promising Kale the power to rule in Hell alongside him. The Ghost Rider double-crosses Blackheart and seemingly kills him, freeing the other Spirits of Vengeance, and gaining rule over Blackheart&#x27;s portion of Hell.

Blackheart survived this encounter and would confront other heroes over the next few years, such as X-Force and the Fantastic Four. He would be relegated to &quot;meeting scenes over the next few years,&quot; seen briefly in meetings with other lords of the underworld (including his father Mephisto, returned to power) such as Satannish, Hela, and Dormammu.

Blackheart later concocts a scheme to bring Hell to Earth and steal the souls of the planet&#x27;s residents. As part of the plan, he takes human form and runs an operation in Las Vegas that sees him create several clones of X-23 and bond them to genetically created symbiotes. After Ghost Rider accidentally transports Hell to Las Vegas, Blackheart is confronted by the Ghost Rider, Venom, Red Hulk, and X-23, and summons four creatures that represent the antitheses of the four and sets them against the heroes.

Blackheart was later seen in Chicago where he posed as the Mayor of Chicago at the time when Falcon and Patriot are dealing with the gang violence. He later tried to corrupt the Champions, but was defeated when those he had under his control managed to overcome their self-doubts, and Mephisto pulled him back to Hell for punishment.

In &quot;Avengers Academy: Marvel&#x27;s Voices&quot;, Blackheart is sent by Mephisto to retrieve the adolescent time-displaced souls of Billy and Tommy Maximoff from the Avengers Academy campus. Despite viewing the twins&#x27; souls as innocent, Blackheart reluctantly follows through with his father&#x27;s orders but is thwarted by Bloodline and Escapade. Influenced by Escapade&#x27;s powers, Blackheart lets the boys go and returns to Hell empty handed. As punishment, Mephisto turns Blackheart into a human and banishes him to Earth. Blackheart requests shelter at the Avengers Academy and is reluctantly allowed to join the student body, eventually taking the name &quot;Gabriel&quot; as an alias for his human form.

== Powers and abilities ==
Blackheart is a powerful demon created by Mephisto. He possesses vast inherent supernatural powers, including superhuman strength, speed and endurance which are magical in nature. He also has telekinetic and telepathic powers and can levitate, teleport inter-dimensionally, change his size and physical form, enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will, heal himself at the sub-molecular level and has the ability to generate various forms of energies for destructive purposes, such as powerful concussive blasts of black energy. He also possesses very high intelligence. Blackheart has demonstrated the ability to call forth armies from the pits of Hell. He has no soul, making him invulnerable to the Ghost Rider&#x27;s Penance Stare.

After he was turned into a human by Mephisto, Blackheart lost many of the superhuman abilities that he had in his demonic form. However, he can still utilize various forms of magic, including energy constructs and hellfire generation.

== Kid Blackheart ==

Devil worshippers, looking to give Satan the perfect son, began the Blackheart Project. They mated some of the vilest individuals in different combinations, hoping to find the right mix to breed the Antichrist. They finally succeeded, but in doing so, they caught the eye of Zadkiel – a betrayer of God and usurper of Heaven. Zadkiel wanted to slay the Antichrist so the apocalypse would never come to pass and he would remain forever. The Black Host made quick work of his enemies and just about every man, woman and child were massacred except for his intended target.
Kid Blackheart settled in New York, but he could not stay hidden forever. Subjected to another assassination attempt, he would have perished if not for Jaine Cutter and her Breathing Gun. Jaine and the Antichrist fled but were again trapped by a group of mindless minions. Hellstorm, also tracking the boy so that he might kill him, ended up having no choice but to defend him from his attackers. Kid Blackheart ran, but did not get far before encountering Daniel Ketch. Snatching the boy from the streets and delivering him back to his saviors, Ketch was not surprised to see his brother, Johnny Blaze, and his Caretaker already in their company. Ketch explained how he made a deal with the devil to keep the boy safe in exchange for the keys to Heaven to stop Zadkiel.

The group split up and the Antichrist played along, staying close to Sara, the Caretaker. When Jaine Cutter and Hellstorm were assaulted by Madcap and Scarecrow, he and Sara became separated from them. Taking refuge in a defiled church, Kid Blackheart decided to reveal his true goal. Master Pandemonium ambushed Sara, knocking her unconscious, so she could be chained and bound. The Antichrist then said a few words in an unintelligible language and exposed Sara for what she truly was – a gateway to Heaven. Kid Blackheart, seeking to destroy Heaven for his father, led a horde of demons through her and into the shining city. However, once he arrived in Heaven, there was an army of Ghost Riders waiting on the other side. His troops did not stand a chance and he was forced to flee, but not before suffering a few blows from Knuckles O&#x27;Shaugnessy. Kid Blackheart met with Master Pandemonium and Blackout for some rest and relaxation before they made another go at conquering the world for Satan.

==Reception==
* In 2020, &quot;CBR.com&quot; ranked Blackheart 6th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Comic Book Villains With Demonic Origins&quot; list.

== Other versions ==
Blackheart is seen in &quot;Marvel Zombies 3&quot; as one of those who are immune to the virus.

== In other media ==
=== Film ===
Blackheart appears in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (2007), portrayed by Wes Bentley. This version primarily assumes and maintains a human form with pale skin and black hair, though he displays traces of his demonic facial features at varying points in the film. Additionally, he is stated to have all of his father, Mephistopheles&#x27;, powers along with a &quot;lethal touch&quot; that he can use to kill people, an immunity to holy objects and places since he was born in hell, and no soul, which makes him immune to the Ghost Rider&#x27;s Penance Stare. Blackheart seeks to obtain the Contract of San Venganza, which grants its owner access to the power of a thousand evil souls. Upon learning of his son&#x27;s search, Mephistopheles transforms Johnny Blaze into the Ghost Rider and tasks him with killing Blackheart. Despite Blaze&#x27;s best efforts, Blackheart succeeds in obtaining the contract and fuses with the souls to become Legion, gaining regenerative capabilities in the process. However, the souls make him susceptible to the Penance Stare, which Blaze exploits to kill Blackheart. Mephistopheles then takes possession of Blackheart&#x27;s corpse and departs from Earth.

<doc id="723881" wikidata="Q1503075" url="?curid=723881" title="Geoffrey Van Orden">
<text>Brigadier Geoffrey Charles Van Orden (born 10 April 1945) is a British politician and former British Army officer who served as Leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament from 2019 to 2020. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the East of England region from 1999 to 2020.

==Early life and career==

Van Orden was born in Waterlooville, Hampshire in 1945. He attended the Mons Officer Cadet School and was commissioned into the Intelligence Corps in 1964. He read politics at Sussex University from 1966 to 1969. He was promoted lieutenant in 1966, captain in 1970, major in 1977, lieutenant-colonel in 1983, colonel in 1988, and brigadier in 1991.

He began his military career in Borneo during the Confrontation war with Sukarno&#x27;s Indonesia. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) at the age of 27 for special duties in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s, at the height of the terrorist campaign. He spent many years in Germany, including 5 years in Berlin where, in 1989, he was Chief of Staff of the British Sector and head of the military intelligence staff when the Wall fell. He was a member of the Cabinet office intelligence Assessment Staff. He attended the Indian Defence Services Staff College and was an instructor at the German General Staff College College (&quot;Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr&quot;) from 1985 to 1988 in Hamburg. His last military appointment was at NATO headquarters in Brussels where he headed the secretariat of the International Military Staff.

He resigned his commission in 1995 in order to enter politics. While seeking a parliamentary seat he became a senior advisor in the European Commission in the field of foreign and security policy issues. He held this post until 1999, when he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for the Conservative Party.

==European Parliament==
===Defence and security===
Following his election to the European Parliament, he became the Conservatives&#x27; spokesman for Foreign, Defence and Security policy. He was one-time Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and remained a member of that committee and of the Security and Defence (SEDE) sub-committee. He has been the Conservative Defence &amp; Security Spokesman for nearly two decades. He has led the opposition to EU defence integration and advanced the need for revitalisation of the NATO Alliance. He has been active in the promotion of Britain&#x27;s defence industries.

===Foreign affairs===
He has long-standing experience of India, was a founder member of the Parliament&#x27;s &quot;Friends of India&quot; group, Chairman of the Europe-India Chamber of Commerce and, since 2014, Chairman of the parliament&#x27;s official Delegation for Relations with India.

He also chairs the &quot;Friends of Sri Lanka&quot; and &quot;Friends of Zimbabwe&quot;, where he was a consistent and outspoken opponent of the Mugabe regime.

He was elected as the Co-Chairman of the Asia-Europe Political Forum, involving some 360 political parties from 52 Asian countries. During the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union, Van Orden was the rapporteur for Bulgaria in the European Parliament, and regularly reported on the progress of the country with regard to EU membership requirements. His final report in November 2006 confirmed Bulgaria&#x27;s preparedness to join the EU.

=== Terrorism ===
He is Vice Chairman of the Special Committee on Terrorism. His commitment to counter-terrorism has informed some of his involvement in countries such as Sri Lanka, India, Israel and the Gulf states.

=== European Conservatives &amp; Reformists ===
He was instrumental in the creation of the &quot;European Conservatives &amp; Reformists&quot; (ECR) political group in the European Parliament, an event that had the aim of building support for conservative change in the European Union. He was its Vice Chairman for most of the time since its foundation in 2009, growing to become the third largest of eight groups in the Parliament, with members from 18 countries. He is also the Founding President of its think-tank, &quot;New Direction - the Foundation for European Reform&quot;, whose patron was Baroness Thatcher (her last major public event was to launch New Direction, in the City of London).

==Political positions==
Van Orden has said he is a eurosceptic seeking reform of the EU while trying to avoid a total break. He is opposed to European political integration. He believes in and facilitates the enlargement of the EU so as to make an ever closer union more difficult to achieve. He is opposed to British membership of the euro, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the Treaty of Lisbon. He had long campaigned for the Conservative Party to end their association with the European People&#x27;s Party in the European Parliament, an aim which was finally achieved in 2009.

Van Orden was the last Conservative MEP to declare a position prior to the Brexit referendum. He opted to vote to remain for pragmatic reasons, in particular to avoid the UK suffering economic disruption and loss of influence, giving control of the continent to Berlin and Paris.

Van Orden is a founding president of the New Direction think tank and is also a member of the Bow Group think tank.

==Personal life==
Geoffrey van Orden married Frances Elizabeth &quot;Fanny&quot; Weir in 1974. The couple have three daughters. He is a member of the Countryside Alliance and the BASC. He was a research associate at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and a Service fellow of King&#x27;s College London as well as Freeman of the City of London and the Worshipful Company of Painter- Stainers.

<doc id="723885" wikidata="Q2464193" url="?curid=723885" title="List of members of the International Ice Hockey Federation">
<text>The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) is the worldwide governing body for ice hockey. It is based in Zurich, Switzerland, and maintains the international ice hockey rulebook, processes international player transfers, dictates officiating guidelines and is responsible for the management of international ice hockey tournaments. The IIHF was created on 15 May 1908, under the name (in French) Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). Belgium, France, Great Britain, Switzerland, and Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) were the founding members. The IIHF was composed entirely of European teams until 1920, when Canada and the United States joined.

As of September 2024, the IIHF has 84 members. Bahrain and Kenya are the newest members, joining on 28 September 2024.

There are three levels of membership in the IIHF. The highest level, IIHF Full Members, are nations that have their own independent ice hockey association and regularly participate in IIHF World Championships. The second level, IIHF Associate Members, either do not have their own independent ice hockey association or have one, but do not meet their minimum participation standards in the IIHF World Championships. The third level, IIHF Affiliate Members, is for nations that only participate in the now-defunct Inline Hockey World Championships. The federation has 60 full members, (including two suspended members), 23 associate members and one affiliate member. Full Members can vote in IIHF Congresses, while Associate and Affiliate Members cannot.

In 2024, 56 IIHF members participated in the Men&#x27;s World Championships and 45 participated in the Women&#x27;s World Championships.

==Members==
===Full members===
A. Austria was expelled from the IIHF in 1920, then re-admitted on January 24, 1924. It was again expelled in 1939 and re-admitted on 27 April 1946.
B. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association withdrew from the LIHG on 13 April 1944, then rejoined on 22 March 1947, as part of the merger with the International Ice Hockey Association.
C. The IIHF recognizes Bohemia, which joined in 1908, and Czechoslovakia as the predecessors to the Czech Republic, which officially became a member in 1993.
D. In 1940, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were annexed by the Soviet Union. Their membership expired on 27 April 1946. The three nations were re-admitted into the IIHF on 6 May 1992.
E. Germany was expelled in 1920, then re-admitted on January 11, 1926. It was again expelled on 27 April 1946. West Germany and East Germany were admitted into the IIHF in 1951 and 1954, respectively. Following their reunification, Germany was re-admitted into the IIHF on 3 October 1990.
F. Japan was expelled from the IIHF on 27 April 1946, then re-admitted on 10 March 1951.
G. Kuwait had originally joined the IIHF in 1985, but was expelled in 1992 due to a lack of ice hockey activity.
H. The IIHF recognizes the Soviet Union, which joined in 1952, as the predecessor to Russia, which officially became a member in 1992.
I. The IIHF recognizes Yugoslavia, which joined in 1939, as the predecessor to Serbia, which officially became a member on 28 September 2006.
J. On 22 March 1947, the LIHG chose to recognize the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States instead of the Amateur Athletic Union as the governing body of ice hockey in the United States, as part of the merger with the International Ice Hockey Association.

===Associate and affiliate members===

K. Armenia was suspended by the IIHF in April 2010 for use of ineligible players on their national team that participated in the 2010 IIHF World Championship Division III Group B in Yerevan, Armenia. The suspension was lifted in 2015.

===Suspended members===

L. Russia and Belarus were suspended indefinitely by the IIHF on 28 February 2022 from competing in the IIHF World Championship because of their invasion of Ukraine.

Kálmán Kandó was born on July 8, 1869, in Pest into an ancient Hungarian noble family. His father was Géza Kandó (1840-1906) and his mother was Irma Gulácsy (1845-1933). He began his grammar school studies at the Budapest Lutheran High School in Sütő street. His parents transferred him from a crowded school to a smaller school, a practice grammar school founded by Mór Kármán. He was enrolled in Budapest Technical University. In 1892, he received a degree in mechanical engineering. He completed his studies with excellent qualifications. Kandó served as a volunteer in the Austro-Hungarian Navy until 1893. He married Ilona Mária Petronella Posch (1880-1913) in Terézváros on February 2, 1899. Their first child, also named Kálmán was born in the winter of 1899, and their daughter Ilona Sára was born in 1901. On July 9, 1913, his wife died of renal failure in Rozsnyó. His son Kálmán became a military officer. On October 18, 1922, his son Kálmán committed suicide with a service pistol (under unclear circumstances) in a military barrack. His daughter Ilona Mária was married on July 7, 1923, and his grandson, George (also an engineer), was born on June 5, 1924.

==Work on railway electrification ==
===France===
After his military service, he traveled to France in the autumn of 1893, and worked for the Fives-Lille Company as a junior engineer, where he designed and developed early induction motors for locomotives. For the manufacture of induction motors, he developed a completely new design-calculation procedure, which made it possible to produce economical AC traction motors for the Fives Lille Company. Kandó designed more suitable 3-phase asynchronous electric drive motors instead of the less effective synchronous electric motors of earlier locomotive designs. Within a year, Kandó was appointed as the chief engineer of the electric motor development at the French firm. András Mechwart (the Ganz and Co.’s managing director at that time) asked him to return to Hungary in 1894 and invited him to work at the electrical engineering department of the Ganz Works.

===Ganz Company, Budapest===
In 1894, Kálmán Kandó developed high-voltage three phase alternating current motors and generators for electric locomotives; he is known as the &quot;father of the electric train&quot;. His work on railway electrification was done at the Ganz electric works in Budapest. Kandó&#x27;s early 1894 designs were first applied in a short three-phase AC tramway in Evian-les-Bains (France), which was constructed between 1896 and 1898. It was driven by 37 HP asynchronous traction system.

In 1907, he moved with his family to Vado Ligure in Italy and obtained employment with Società Italiana Westinghouse. He would later return to Budapest to work at the Ganz factory where he became the managing director.

===Italy, Designing the World&#x27;s first electrified main railway line===

In 1897, Kandó designed an electric system and engines for the Italian railways, the electric traction system had great advantages and importance on the very steep railway tracks in the mountainous regions of Italy. Under his leadership, the Ganz factory began work on three-phase haulage for railways. Based on their design, the Italian Ferrovia della Valtellina was electrified in 1902 and became Europe&#x27;s first electrified main line railway.

For the Valtellina line, three-phase power was supplied at 3,000 volts (later increased to 3,600 volts) through two overhead lines, while the running rails supplied the third phase. At junctions, the two overhead lines had to cross and this prevented the use of very high voltages.

The three-phase, two wire, system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as &quot;the Italian system&quot;. There are now few railways which use this system.

In 1907, the Italian government decided for the electrification of another 2000-km railway line with the restriction that the electrical equipment and rolling stock could only be manufactured in Italy. The Westinghouse Company bought up Kandó&#x27;s patents and paid a license-fee for the electric motors of the Ganz factory. The Westinghouse Company also built a locomotive factory in Vado Ligure, and appointed Kandó to head the new factory. Kandó accepted the invitation and moved to Vado in Italy with his several Hungarian colleagues. Two types of locomotives were developed with his leadership in Italy: a 1500 kw cinquanta and a 2100 kw trenta electric locomotives, from which altogether some 700 units were produced. 540 of these were still in service in 1945, the last three-phase line worked until 1976.
In honour of Kandó’s work, he was awarded with Commendatore dell&#x27;Ordine della Corona d&#x27;Italia (Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy), but in 1915 he had to flee through Switzerland, since Italy entered World War I on the Entente side and declared war on the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.

===Electrification of the London underground lines, a moral victory===

On the District and Metropolitan Railways, the use of steam locomotives led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and by the early twentieth century electrification was seen as the way forward. A tender was announced for an electric system, and the largest European and American companies applied to win the tender. However, when the experts of the railways compared the designs from the Ganz Works to the offers of the other large European and American competitors, they concluded that Ganz Works&#x27; technology was cheaper and more reliable and described its technology as a &quot;revolution in electric railway traction&quot;.
In 1901, a metropolitan and district joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially, this was unanimously accepted by both parties, until the district found an investor, the American Charles Yerkes, to finance the upgrade. Yerkes raised £1 million (1901 pounds adjusted by inflation are £) and soon had control of the District Railway. However Yerkes favoured the classic DC system, similar to that in use on the City &amp; South London Railway and Central London Railway. The Metropolitan Railway protested about the change of plan, but after arbitration by the Board of Trade the DC system was adopted.

===Vienna, invention of the phase converter===
During World War I, between 1916 and 1917, Kandó was a lieutenant completing military service for the Ministry of Defence in Vienna. He worked out a revolutionary system of phase-changing electrical hauling, whereby locomotives were powered by the standard, 50-period, single-phase alternating current used in the national energy supply system.
He was the first who recognised that an electric train system can only be successful if it can use the electricity from public networks.
In 1918, Kandó invented and developed the rotary phase converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high voltage national networks.

===Hungary===
To avoid the problems associated with the use of two overhead wires, Kandó developed a modified system for use in Hungary. Power semiconductors not having been invented yet in the 1930s, the Kandó V40 locomotives&#x27; systems relied on electromechanics and electrochemistry.

==== Kandó synchronous phase converter ====

Single-phase power was supplied at 16,000 volts and 50 Hz through a single overhead line and converted to three-phase on the locomotive by a rotary phase converter. The drive motors, made by Metropolitan-Vickers, had a very large diameter of 3 meters and incorporated four sets of 24 magnetic poles each, which could be added to the traction effort at will, producing highly efficient constant speeds of 25, 50, 75 and 100 km/h over rail (or 17/34/51/68 km/h for the V60 heavy freight train engine variant, which had six pairs of smaller driving wheels).

He created an electric machine called a synchronous phase converter, which was a single-phase synchronous motor and a three-phase synchronous generator with common stator and rotor.

It had two independent windings:
* The outer winding is a single-phase synchronous motor. The motor takes the power from the overhead line.
* The inner winding is a three-phase (or variable-phase) synchronous generator, which provides the power for the three- (or more) phase traction motors.

==The World&#x27;s first industrial frequency single phase AC main line==

The MÁV company decided to electrify the 190 km long Budapest-Hegyeshalom main line with a new &quot;Kandó system&quot;. 

For the electric trial operations with the locomotive, the double-track main line section from Nyugati Railway Station to Dunakeszi-Alag station (now Dunakeszi) was selected. The first successful test was made on October 31, 1923. Based on experiences from the initial months, the prototype locomotive was redesigned under Kandó’s leadership in 1926: modifications were made to the phase converter, speed regulation system, and motor windings. With the upgraded locomotive, approximately 62,000 kilometers of test runs were conducted between August 1928 and the end of 1931.

The system was fed from a three-phase 110 kV transmission line from the Bánhida power station, which had been commissioned in 1930, via a single-phase 16 kV 50 Hz overhead line converted at four transformer stations. Of the four line sections, two are connected to the same phase and the other two are loaded to the other phase. This means that the railway, despite the single-phase supply, still provides a roughly symmetrical load for the power plant. The transformer substations were simple, cheap and with excellent efficiency. The distance between substations was greater than any other system (35–40 km). On an experimental basis, the substation at Torbágy was switched off and the feed was taken over by the substation at Banhida. Even so, uninterrupted service could be maintained for 74 km distance from the feeder. The line, applied his phase-change system, was electrified as far as Komárom and opened for traffic in 1932.

;V40 Engine details
The greatest challenge was the creation of a locomotive capable of operating on a 50-cycle power supply. The first prototype locomotive was built in 1913 and underwent modifications based on operational experience. Test runs were conducted on the Budapest-Alag trial line. These experiments led to the development of the V40 series phase-shifting locomotive, also known as the Kandó locomotive. It had a power output of 2500 horsepower. The 16 kV, single-phase current taken from the overhead line was directly supplied to the primary winding of the phase shifter through the pantograph and the main switch. The phase shifter was an innovative solution that was ahead of its time. This was an extremely complex electrical machine. Its primary winding was located in the stator. This winding, along with the rotor excited by direct current, functioned as a single-phase synchronous motor. The rotor, located in the slots of the stator cores, induced 3, 4, or 6-phase voltages according to the switching sequence. Therefore, the secondary winding forms a multi-phase generator with the rotor. Thus, the phase shifter combines a single-phase synchronous motor and a multi-phase generator in one machine. Noteworthy is the water cooling system integrated into the windings of the rotor. The locomotive&#x27;s only motor, a multi-phase induction motor, received a voltage of around 1000 V from the phase shifter. The phase shifter provided a constant 50-cycle current, so changing the speed and rotation was achieved by switching the motor&#x27;s pole number. The continuous transition between synchronous speeds resulting from pole switching was ensured by water resistance.

;Power factor
A major benefit of this arrangement was a power factor of nearly 1.00 in the catenary-attached equipment, which fulfilled the electric powerplants&#x27; strict load-distributing regulations. The unacceptably poor power factor of pre-World War II design electric motors (occasionally as low as 0.65) was not felt outside the Kando locomotives, as the phase changer machinery provided isolation.

;Speed control
Intermediate speeds were maintained by connecting a water and saltpeter based adjustable resistor to the line, which reduced the efficiency of the locomotive. Timetables for electrified lines were supposed to allow use of full efficiency constant speeds most of the time but, in practice, the need to share the track with trains hauled by MÁV Class 424 steam locomotives meant the water-hungry and wasteful &quot;gearbox resistor&quot; had to be used often.

;Kandó triangle drive
The propulsive force was transferred to the locomotive&#x27;s wheels using a traditional pushrod system, designed to provide manufacturing and maintenance commodity to the predominantly steam-based Hungarian Railways (MÁV) of the time. The so-called Kandó triangle arrangement transferred power from the electric motor to the pushrods in such a way that no oblique forces were exerted on the chassis, making the V40 less hurtful to the rail track compared to steam engines. In practice the V40 pushrod system was too precise for steam-era habits based maintenance and required more frequent care.

;Shaft drive
More than a decade after Kandó&#x27;s death two new, shaft-driven prototypes of his design were built by the Ganz company, to allow for 125 km/h traction speeds. The V44 electric locomotives proved too heavy for general use, owing to their 22 metric ton per axle rail load. Both vehicles were eventually destroyed in USAAF bombing raids in 1944, running only 16,000 kilometers overall.

;Bogie-mounted motors
After the second World War, a last series of electric phase-changer locomotives were built by the new communist government in Hungary. Owing to Cold War restrictions, the innovative V55 type, which used bogie-mounted motors, had to be constructed of domestic components entirely and suffered from reliability problems in their double-conversion phase-changer / frequency-changer propulsion system. (The traction motors of pre-WWII V40 and V60 locomotives were made in Britain by the Metropolitan-Vickers company, as part of an economic aid programme organized by Lord Rothermere.)

;Preservation
Currently one example of the V40, the V55 and the V60 locomotive each survives. They are preserved at the Budapest Railway History Park, but require restoration after decades of open air static display. If funding permits, the repaired V40 may return to the open track for &quot;nostalgic service&quot;, with a semiconductor front-end added to its system for 25 to 16 kV AC down-step conversion.

===France===
Kandó designed in 1926 the 1.5 kV DC 2BB2 400 (:fr:2BB2 400) for the Paris-Orleans line which were the strongest DC locomotives in Europe at that time. The Ganz Works of Budapest, Hungary supplied these two locomotives, to the design of Kálmán Kandó.

===United Kingdom===

8 years after the death of Kandó, the engineering office of the Ganz Works won several British tenders, which were mostly based on Kandó&#x27;s latest technology. British firms were entrusted with the implementation of these plans. There were plans to use the two-wire, three-phase, system on the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway in Wales and the Metropolitan Railway in London but neither of these plans came to fruition due to the outbreak of WW II.

==Death and legacy==

Kálmán Kandó died of unexpected heart failure in Budapest on January 13, 1931. The ever-increasing strain of work, a series of family tragedies, the hassle of his life&#x27;s work, and the foreign bank loan that influenced the implementation of the phase-change system, all combined to strain Kandó&#x27;s sudden death.

He did not live to see the final commissioning of his system, the realisation of his masterpiece, the locomotive he had designed. On 17 August 1932, the first phase-changing locomotive, V40 001, was tested by the engineers. After his death, the development of the electric locomotive continued on the path he had set, under the direction of Ferenc Ratkovszky and Andor Mándi.

Many modern electric trains work on the same three-phase high tension AC principle introduced by the Kandó V40 locomotives, but the rotary converter is replaced by semiconductor devices. Three-phase powered electric motors allow for high traction effort even at great speeds and the difficulty of maintaining arbitrary speeds at full efficiency is eliminated by using IGBT semiconductors and the use of digital controls.

The number of Kálmán Kandó&#x27;s patents granted between 1895 and 1929 is 69. More than 50 patents were bought by locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing companies in foreign countries like the UK, US, Germany, France and Italy. The patents are grouped around the topics of electric railway motors, multi-phase AC motors, automatic railway switching devices, overhead lines, phase converters, railway safety techniques and power transmission stations.

In Miskolc, the square in front of the Tiszai railway station, where his statue is also standing, bears his name, as well as a vocational secondary school. In Budapest, the Kandó Kálmán Faculty of Electrical Engineering (formerly an independent technical college, now part of Óbuda University), also bears his name. The minor planet 126245 Kandókálmán was named after him.

<doc id="723895" wikidata="Q11813891" url="?curid=723895" title="Paw Paw Tunnel">
<text>The Paw Paw Tunnel is a canal tunnel on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&amp;O) in Allegany County, Maryland. Located near Paw Paw, West Virginia, it was built to bypass the Paw Paw Bends, a stretch of the Potomac River containing five horseshoe-shaped bends. The town, the bends, and the tunnel take their name from the pawpaw trees that grow prolifically along nearby ridges.

Built using more than six million bricks, the tunnel has been described as &quot;the greatest engineering marvel along the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal National Historical Park.&quot; Located at milepost 155.2, the tunnel served to eliminate six miles of canal and is credited with contributing to the economic success of nearby Cumberland, Maryland.

Construction on the tunnel began in 1836 and was expected to be completed within two years at a total cost of $33,500. But the project proved far more complicated and costly than expected, and the tunnel did not open until 1850, more than a decade behind schedule.

The project was delayed for many reasons. Not only did the construction company underestimate the difficulty of the work, violence frequently broke out among immigrant laborers of different ethnicities, and wages often went unpaid due to the company&#x27;s financial problems. By the time the tunnel was finally completed at a price of $600,000, it had nearly bankrupted the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company. Due to the high cost and long delay in completing the tunnel, the construction ended at Cumberland, Maryland, falling short of the original plan to take it all the way to Pittsburgh.

The tunnel was used by canal boats until the C&amp;O closed in 1924. The tunnel and towpath are now maintained for public use as part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. Though never one of the longest tunnels in the world, Paw Paw Tunnel remains one of the greatest engineering feats of its day.

==History==

At Paw Paw, the canal engineers had a quandary with no easy solutions: follow the river (with its cliffs which would have required crossing over to West Virginia (then part of Virginia), damming the river to make a slackwater, and hacking out from the cliffs on the Maryland side) or make a tunnel. The newly appointed engineer, Charles B. Fisk, managed to convince the board of directors of a tunnel&#x27;s superiority. The tunnel plan was approved in February 1836, with an expected completion date of July 1838.

Lee Montgomery, a Methodist minister who had experience from building the canal tunnel for the Union Canal was awarded the contract on March 15, 1836. Construction on the tunnel began in 1836. Unfortunately for Montgomery, the Irish workers were not skilled at tunnel work, so he obtained English masons, English and Welsh miners, and some &quot;Dutch&quot; [i.e. German] labourers. More unfortunately, this caused ethnic tensions which exploded into violence in 1837 and 1838, specifically between the Irish and everyone else; rioters destroyed the tavern at Oldtown, burned shanties, and the like. There were more riots in 1839 at Little Orleans. Montgomery succeeded in boring the tunnel through on June 5, 1840, at a point from the south portal, but did not finish it.

Due to construction and financial problems, no work was done from 1841 to 1847.

In 1848, a subcontract was let to McCulloch and Day to finish the tunnel. The tunnel was opened for traffic (and essentially completed) in 1850, but the brick liner was not finished until after the tunnel was opened. The construction costs were $616,478.65, much more than had originally been budgeted.

In 1872, a semaphore signal was installed at the west end of the tunnel to control traffic.

==Boatmen and the tunnel==

Boatmen could usually tell if another boat was in the tunnel because the water level would be down about . The loaded boat going downstream had the right of way, but that was not often honored, and there were occasional fistfights between rival boatmen over the right of way.

The tunnel was so narrow that nobody could pass between the mules and the side of the tunnel. There are records of passengers playing music (to hear the echo) or singing in the tunnel to keep up their courage.

==The tunnel today==
Today the Paw Paw Tunnel can be easily explored with a flashlight, as the towpath is still intact. Trekkers can return via the tunnel, or hike back over the Tunnel Hill Trail. This passes interpretive markers about the German and Irish workers who lived along the path during the tunnel&#x27;s construction.

A rockslide in January 2013 closed the trail east of the tunnel for four months, so the tunnel could not be reached from the east side. It reopened on April 17, 2013.

The NPS started a two-phase construction project to fix the scaling of rock on the downstream tunnel approach in 2017. The first phase, which addressed the most urgent sections of the deteriorating rock slope, has been completed. The second phase will begin the first week of May 2019 and will address additional hazards downstream of the newly completed section. The cost is listed as $750,000.

<doc id="723899" wikidata="Q1577089" url="?curid=723899" title="Dura-Europos synagogue">
<text>The Dura-Europos synagogue was an ancient Jewish former synagogue discovered in 1932 at Dura-Europos, Syria. The former synagogue contained a forecourt and house of assembly with painted walls depicting people and animals, and a Torah shrine in the western wall facing Jerusalem. It was built backing on to the city wall, which was important in its survival. The last phase of construction was dated by an Aramaic inscription to 244 CE, making it one of the oldest synagogues in the world. It was unique among the many ancient synagogues that have emerged from archaeological excavations as the structure was preserved virtually intact, and it had extensive figurative wall-paintings, which came as a considerable surprise to scholars. These paintings are now displayed in the National Museum of Damascus.

Dura-Europos was a small garrison and trading city on the river Euphrates, and usually on the frontier between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Parthian and finally the Sassanid Empires of Persia. It changed hands at various points but was Roman from 165 AD. Before the final Persian destruction of the town in 256–257 AD, parts of the synagogue which abutted the main city wall were apparently requisitioned and filled with sand as a defensive measure. The city was abandoned after its fall and never resettled, and the lower walls of the rooms remained buried and largely intact until excavated. The short measure of time during which it was used ensured that it would have limited impact upon Jewish or Christian art. The excavations also discovered very important wall-paintings from places of worship of Christianity at the Dura-Europos church. In addition, there were wall paintings edifying Mithraism, and fragmentary Christian texts in Hebrew.

In the Syrian Civil War, the site was occupied by ISIL, and what was left of the synagogue and a number of other buildings there appear to have been destroyed, possibly in 2014.

== Jewish community of Dura Europos ==
The presence of a Jewish community in Dura Europos long preceded the construction of the synagogue. The cities of Mesopotamia had flourishing Jewish communities, whose members descended both from exiles during the time of Nebuchadnezzar II and from refugees from the Jewish–Roman wars under Vespasian and Hadrian. The Jewish diaspora had an official representative in the Parthian and then Sasanian Empires, the exilarch, necessarily of Davidic descent. The towns of Sura and Nehardea were home to Talmudic academies whose fame can even exceed that of Palestine&#x27;s, thanks to the respective influence of Abba Arika (Rav) and Rabbi Chila. Important caravan town on the Euphrates, Dura Europos very likely had a Jewish community from the 2 or 1 centuries AD. There is nevertheless no archaeological trace of a religious organization before the installation of the synagogue.

== Architecture of the synagogue ==
The synagogue is a building belonging to the L7 block of Dura Europos: the city was organized according to a Hippodamian plan of regular rectangular blocks of since its development by the Seleucids, which archaeologists have arbitrarily numbered for more convenient reference. This islet L7 is located in the first north-south row, and the second east-west row north of the Decumanus Maximus: it is therefore bordered to the west by the street along the rampart, between the towers 19 and 20, and on the other sides respectively by streets A to the east, 2 to the south and 4 to the north.

It was originally a residential block comprising up to ten separate units (designated by the letters A to I on the map below), one of which was dedicated to the needs of the Jewish community and transformed into a building of worship. This location on the outskirts of the city, as well as modesty of the first building, are often used as an argument to emphasize the small size of the community. With the expansions and reconstructions made necessary by its development, the synagogue ended up becoming the central nucleus and the most important building of a small Jewish quarter. The last state of the building, with its famous frescoes, is thus the second phase of the second synagogue to occupy the place.

== Torah shrine ==
The decoration of the Torah shrine consists of two elements. The first one includes, &quot;the uppermost step of the niche-block, the columns of the facade, and the intrados of the archivolt.&quot; The second one involves important religious scenes, objects and pictures of Jewish worship. 

The interior of the niche consists of three parts: the conch had a light-blue color that faded all at once after the excavation. The outer surface of the shell is a rich green color. The columns and the bottom of the niche are painted to look like marble revetments. The bottom of the niche consists of five rectangular panels that are framed on top and bottom by pink bands, and there are red vertical bands to separate them from each other. Out of the five panels, one and five are a pair and two and four are another pair: they are all designed by the same fashion. For the first and the fifth panel, the artists used black diagonal lines to divide triangular patterned designs. Opposing triangles on the top and the bottom of the panel has red stripes and are inscribed with peltae. Opposing triangles on the sides of the panels are decorated with brown-lined irregular concentric shapes, with a green dot in the middle of each. On the second and the fourth panels, the outer frame is decorated with red and pink bands, and alternating red dots and strokes against the white background, with bead-and-reel designs on the corners. On the corners of the strips, there are three-petal like strokes. Inside the frame, there are wavy green and dark green curvy lines of different thickness drawn from the top left and right corners of the panel towards the middle. The central panel of the niche consists of a veined black diamond with a yellow circle in the middle. The diamond is framed with the same bead-and-reel design that surrounded the second and the fourth panels. The four triangles that are on the side of the diamond are decorated in brown colors. 

The figural decoration above the niche on the front face of the arch is particularly significant. The spandrels formed a rectangle that is 1.47m wide and 1.06m high, framed by a pink border that is 0.04m–0.05m wide. On the left side of the front face is a representation of a menorah, and on the right side was a depiction of the sacrifice of Isaac. Depicted in the central position was a columned building with an arched doorway. 

==Wall paintings==
The paintings cover the walls of the main &quot;Assembly Room&quot;, using three levels of pictures over a dado frieze of symbols in most places, reaching a height of about 7 metres. Stylistically they are provincial versions of contemporary Graeco-Roman style and technique; several different artists seem to have worked on them. Technically they are not fresco (paint fused into wet plaster) but tempera over plaster. Earlier parts of the building have decorative painting with no figures. Some of the paintings have figures whose eyes have been scratched out, especially those in Persian costume.

===Iconography===
Scholars cannot agree on the subjects of some scenes, because of damage, or the lack of comparative examples.

The scenes depicted are drawn from the Hebrew Bible and include many narrative scenes, and some single figure &quot;portraits&quot;—58 scenes in total, probably representing about 60% of the original number. They include the Binding of Isaac and other Genesis stories, Moses receiving the Tablets of the Law, Moses leading the Hebrews out of Egypt, Moses at the burning bush, the visions of Ezekiel, a figure of Enoch or possibly Abraham, the water miracle in the desert, the return of Ark from the temple of Dagon, Ezra with the scrolls and many others. The Hand of God motif is used to represent divine intervention or approval in several paintings.

There have been scholarly debates questioning the wall paintings&#x27; influence over later Jewish and/or Christian iconography, which have been held due to the relevance of such early depictions of the biblical narrative.

Depictions of Moses and the Book of Exodus occupy significant swathes of space in the paintings on the Western Wall of the synagogue - of the 12 discrete paintings identified in the Hopkins schematic, 3 center on the narrative of Moses&#x27; life, with a total of 7 depictions of Moses across the western wall. Some paintings contain multiple representations of Moses within one distinct scene. 
The painting of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt features multiple Moses figures, much like the painting labeled &quot;WC4&quot;. Between the first Moses&#x27;s legs is an inscription in Aramaic reading, &quot;Moses, when he went out from Egypt and cleft the sea.&quot; This inscription firmly identifies the murals as depicting the story of Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea from the Book of Exodus. First (on the right) Moses is seen raising a club-like staff and facing to the left, leading an army of Israelites behind him. Second, Moses is seen lowering his staff over the Red Sea, causing its parted waters to close and engulf the pursuing Egyptian army. Here he is facing to the right of the painting. And finally, Moses is seen looking to the left at his safely absconded Israelites, holding his staff at his side, pointed downward. 

The synagogue paintings&#x27; portrayal of Moses and the Israelites each contain influences from the concurrent Roman military culture. Moses is portrayed as the leader of the Israelites who are shown not as civilians or slaves, but as an armed military force. In this context, Moses&#x27; powerful stance and comparatively large size present him as the military leader of the Israelites. His long club-like rod or staff and bearded visage have been compared to a relief of Hercules from the 2nd-century Durene temple of Zeus, built during the 114 CE Roman occupation of the city.

The mass of Israelites positioned to his left carry shields and spears. Their shields are layered and overlapped over one another to form a physical barrier, much like the Roman shield wall formations of the phalanx and the testudo. Behind the Israelite soldiers stand figures representing the twelve Elders of Israel, each holding a pole with a square banner or flag, resembling the Roman vexillum, the military standards of the Roman army.

Below the painting of Moses and the Israelites is a painting of a temple, portrayed explicitly as a contemporary Roman-style temple. The temple&#x27;s pediment is low and is decorated with a rinceau design, often and originally found in Roman buildings. The temple also features Corinthian columns, characteristic of both earlier Hellenistic and contemporary Roman architecture. At either end of each of the temple&#x27;s two pediments are acroteria in the form of winged victory or Nike figures. Both the architectural ornament of the acroteria and the Nike symbol stem are characteristic of Hellenistic and contemporary Roman architecture.

====Consecration of the Tabernacle mural====

Located on the western wall of the synagogue, just left of the Torah niche, is a mural depicting the Tabernacle. The artist did not follow the biblical description of the Tabernacle as a tent, but rather was inspired by Roman temples, and includes a cella, pediment and capitals of the Corinthian order. The local Jewish population did not mind illustrating the Tabernacle based on Roman civil architecture for unknown reasons. Coins showing similar structures were found in Dura-Europos, and the painter might have used them as models.

In this particular work, Aaron is depicted standing just to the right of the door of the tent of meeting, denoted by the Greek alphabet inscription (&quot;ARON&quot;). He is dressed in contemporary Persian or Sassanid style, but with the same colors mentioned in the Book of Exodus: gold, blue, and purple. The Ephod worn by the high priest as described in the Bible is not shown.

To the bottom left, there is a young priest leading a cow, which is the special sacrificial red heifer. A dorsal band decorates its body. The two animals just to the left of Aaron, a bull and a ram, are atonement sacrifices for Aaron to be made on Yom Kippur.

== Ceiling ==
The ceiling was believed to have been created between 244 CE and 245 CE; it was part of the retransformation from which the Dura-Europos synagogue derived. It was around 7m tall and had dimensions of 13.65m x 7.68m, like the assembly hall. It was later found out that the previous synagogue was also decorated similarly, including tiles decorated with fruits, shapes, and flowers. However, the Dura-Europos synagogue&#x27;s ceiling was made up of even smaller tiles than the previous ceiling; it occupied a larger space and had a wider variety of tile inscriptions.

The synagogue&#x27;s ceiling is made up of repeated tiles and inscriptions. The ceiling is often compared to aerial mosaics, similar to coffered ceilings that supported the tiles, which were already discovered in western societies, such as Roman and Hellenistic cities. The original placement of the tiles, between 244 CE and 245 CE, has not been clearly stated, but each tile was around 0.37 to 0.42 m2 and about 0.045 m in depth. They were formed out of terracotta, which was heated, then decorated and plastered to the above ceiling. Imprints of brick and wooden beams were located on the ceiling tile at the time of the synagogue&#x27;s build and made the tiles&#x27; placement clearer.

The tiles are consistent with either pictorial images or inscriptions being displayed. There were about 20 different pictorial tiles that were repeated across the ceiling. They varied from sea animals, land animals, grains, and vegetation to faces and females. Often displayed are female faces, which have been counted to recur 23 times on the ceiling and usually follow a particular pattern. The available prototypes are considered goddesses such as &quot;Flora&quot; or &quot;Demeter-Persephone.&quot; Female faces were among the most popular pictorial tiles. Other popular pictorial types include vegetation, which consists of about 41 roses/flowers, a centaur, and pinecones, among others. Other tiles have a goat&#x27;s head attached to a fishtail, which is often classified as a sea-goat; others are thought to represent Capricorn and Pisces. Another theme was the evil eye; an example is a tile featuring a double-lidded eye with a snake on either side. The same tile also had a scab, which was thought to be a scorpion, and three nails above the eye, with the inscription &quot;&quot;. Several tiles, both inscribed and pictorials, had mystical and symbolic meanings. Even though it is debated, some scholars claim that the entirety of the ceiling symbolizes heaven and eternal immortality. However, some uncertainty remains due to the paint not being recognizable on the tile after sun exposure. A total of 234 tiles were discovered and brought back at the time of discovery. However, there may be more that were destroyed and different designs that had not been discovered.  

The inscribed tiles were written in Greek or Aramaic and followed a specific prototype. The tiles saved were mainly in Greek; the prototype was the tile painted black, with a black and red leafy wreath on it, where text was confined. One of the first tiles discovered, in Greek, reads &quot;(Samuel [son] of Yedaya, elder of the Jews founded [the building])&quot;, naming Archisynagogue Samuel as the &#x27;founder&#x27; in 245 AD. Often names were mentioned, and it suggested that they were donors or people involved in the creation, reconstruction, or decoration of the synagogue; it is not clear what their roles were, but their involvement is evident.

==Cultural context and purpose of the murals==
Because of the paintings adorning the walls, the synagogue was at first mistaken for a Greek temple, though this was quickly corrected by the vice-director of excavations Robert du Mesnil du Buisson in &quot;Les peintures de la synagogue de Doura-Europos&quot; (Rome, 1939). Mesnil also made detailed comparisons of the friezes from the Dura synagogue with those of the mithraeum, the Christian baptistery, and the temple of the Palmyrene gods.

Scholars think the paintings were used as an instructional display to educate and teach the history and laws of the religion. Some think that this synagogue was painted in order to compete with the many other religions practiced in Dura-Europos; the new (and considerably smaller) Christian Dura-Europos church appears to have opened shortly before the surviving paintings were begun in the synagogue. The large-scale pictorial art in the synagogue came as a surprise to scholars, although they already suspected that there was a tradition of Jewish narrative religious art at this period, which at the time of the discovery were thought to have all been lost, leaving only traces in later Christian art. The discovery of the synagogue helps to dispel narrow interpretations of Judaism&#x27;s historical prohibition of visual images.

==Relationship to early Christian art and late Jewish art==
The synagogue of Dura-Europos offers negligible influence on later Christian and Jewish artwork. The time that the Dura-Europos synagogue was active was not long as it was buried as part of the Roman defense against Sasanian troops in 256 A.D. The Dura-Europos Synagogue remains the earliest example of Jewish artwork available for study. It contains not only Hellenistic and Roman influences, but Sasanian as well.

The layout of the paintings suggest that they were inspired by a copybook with examples and formulae. While there are similarities to other works of antiquity, the differences between each work bear too much difference in order for one to be considered influential. There have been attempts to link these works, but they have proven largely unsuccessful.

The Leon Bible, as an example, which was written ca. 960, had in common with Dura-Europos the scene of the sacrifice of Isaac. However, the León Bible showed key differences. Their position in the León Bible shows them facing the viewer, whereas Dura Europos they are not. In the León Bible, the Hand of God bestows the &quot;benedictio latina&quot;, whereas in Dura-Europos it makes an appearance with no such manuscript. The Dura painting shows Abraham&#x27;s hand free of Isaac&#x27;s hair, whereas in the León miniature, it is grasping it. Finally, in the Dura painting Abraham is using a knife as opposed to the sword he uses in the León Bible.

<text>Theresa Anne Villiers (born 5 March 1968) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Chipping Barnet from 2005 to 2024, having previously served as a Member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2005. A member of the Conservative Party, Villiers was Minister of State for Rail and Aviation from 2010 to 2012, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland from 2012 to 2016 and Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2019 to 2020.

==Early life==
Villiers was born in Hunstanton, Norfolk in 1968, the third child of George Edward Villiers by his marriage to Anne Virginia Threlfall; she has two elder brothers, Edward and Henry. On her father&#x27;s side, she is a descendant of Edward Ernest Villiers (1806–1843), brother of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon, Thomas Hyde Villiers, Charles Pelham Villiers, and Henry Montagu Villiers and a direct descendant of King Edward II.

Growing up in North London, she was educated at the independent Francis Holland School. Villiers gained a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree with first-class honours in 1990 from the University of Bristol, and a year later the postgraduate degree of Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) from Jesus College, Oxford. After university, she qualified for the bar at the Inner Temple, and worked as a lecturer at King&#x27;s College London from 1994 until 1999.

==Member of the European Parliament==
Villiers was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the London constituency in 1999, and was re-elected in 2004. She stood down after the 2005 general election when she was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Chipping Barnet.

She served as Deputy Leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament between 2001 and 2002. She also served as a member of the governing board of the Conservative Party during this period.

==Member of Parliament==
In 2003, following Sir Sydney Chapman&#x27;s announcement that he would retire at the following election, Villiers was selected as the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Chipping Barnet. Although Chapman&#x27;s majority at the 2001 general election had only been 2,701 votes, the party viewed Chipping Barnet to be quite a &quot;safe&quot; Conservative seat, and Villiers held it at the 2005 general election with an increased majority of 5,960 votes, which she increased again to 11,927 in 2010. Her majority dropped to 7,656 in 2015, and was reduced to just 353 in 2017. However, Villiers&#x27; majority rose to 1,212 in the 2019 general election, despite her percentage share of the vote going down slightly.

Upon her election to the House of Commons in 2005, she resigned from her seat in the European Parliament; it went to Syed Kamall, the next candidate on the Conservatives&#x27; regional list for London. Villiers now lives at Arkley in her constituency.

Villiers was sworn of the Privy Council on 9 June 2010.

In July 2021, Villiers was one of five Conservative MPs found by the Commons Select Committee on Standards to have breached the code of conduct by trying to influence a judge in the trial of former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, who was eventually found guilty of three counts of sexual assault and sentenced to two years in prison. Villiers was one of three of the group recommended for a one-day suspension by the committee.

Villiers lost her seat in the 2024 general election. The Chipping Barnet constituency, with adjusted boundaries, was gained by the Labour Party and incoming MP Dan Tomlinson.

===Shadow Cabinet===
In December 2005, following the election of David Cameron as Conservative Party Leader, Villiers was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet, as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In July 2007, Cameron promoted her to Shadow Secretary of State for Transport.

===Government===

Following the 2010 general election, the Conservatives, short of an overall majority, formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. This required positions in Cabinet to be awarded to Lib Dem MPs, so Villiers did not become Secretary of State for Transport as might have been expected in the event of a majority Conservative government taking office. That role went instead to Philip Hammond, who had shadowed the post of Chief Secretary to the Treasury. Villiers instead became a Minister of State at the Department for Transport.

Villiers was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in September 2012. Her time in Northern Ireland gained mixed reviews. She made a speech in February 2016 defending the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British Army, which had been accused of colluding with loyalist murderers in the Loughinisland massacre. The Police Ombudsman who investigated the murders, Michael Maguire, later stated with regard to law enforcement authorities colluding with the murderers: &quot;I have no hesitation in unambiguously determining that collusion is a significant feature of the Loughinisland murders&quot;.

Villiers had said that &quot;a pernicious counter-narrative&quot; of the Troubles was emerging whereby responsibility for acts of terrorism was being shifted onto the security forces &quot;through allegations of collusion, misuse of agents and informers or other forms of unlawful activity&quot;.

Villiers was one of the six cabinet ministers who came out in support of Brexit during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. As the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the time, she was pressed to explain her view of the problems her position could cause the province. In April 2016, she gave a speech saying those raising concerns about Brexit&#x27;s impact on Northern Ireland were &quot;scaremongering&quot;. Following the referendum, on 14 July 2016, Villiers resigned from her position as Northern Ireland Secretary after stating that new Prime Minister Theresa May had offered her a post in the Cabinet which was &quot;not one which I felt I could take on&quot;.
During the referendum, 62.2% of voters in her constituency (based on a 72.1% turnout), voted to remain in the European Union. After the referendum, Villiers continued to support leaving the EU.

Villiers was appointed Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by Boris Johnson upon him becoming Prime Minister in July 2019. She left the government in the post-Brexit cabinet reshuffle.

In June 2020 &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper reported that the delay in the formation of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament since the 2019 United Kingdom general election had been due to Villiers appointment having been dismissed by the Prime Minister for her defiance of the Government&#x27;s whip on a vote where she supported an amendment which would have banned the import of chlorinated chicken products from the US in upcoming post-Brexit trade negotiations.

===Parliamentary expenses and second home===
She also has a house in Arkley in her North London constituency of Chipping Barnet. The house, a semi-detached property that she bought for £296,500 in May 2004, is an eight-minute drive away from High Barnet tube station, from which commuters can reach Westminster in about forty-five minutes.

===Political opinions===
Villiers supported the temporary suspension of Ken Livingstone, then-Mayor of London, by the Adjudication Panel for England, which examined the case after a complaint from the Board of Deputies of British Jews to the Standards Board for England.

Theresa Villiers is a member, and since 2017 Vice-Chair, of Conservative Friends of Israel.

On 19 July 2018 she was the only MP of any party to attend a rally of about 200–300 Jewish and other persons called by the &quot;Campaign Against Antisemitism&quot; (CAA) in Parliament Square, London, to protest against Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party. She has, on previous occasions, attended CAA protests similar to that of 19 July 2018 against anti-semitism within Labour.

Together with Matthew Offord, she spoke out publicly in support of Iranian resistance to the Iranian regime at an event in Paris in 2017, organised by the National Council of Resistance of Iran. They protested against human right abuses and executions in Iran.

Since September 2008, Villiers has dedicated a considerable proportion of her public announcements to aviation policy, specifically the expansion of airports in the South East of England. Villiers underlined that despite differences of opinion, the Coalition government&#x27;s policy was opposed to a third runway at Heathrow airport.

She has also spoken out against Boris Johnson&#x27;s favoured proposal for a new London airport to be built in the Thames Estuary, and alternative expansions at Gatwick and Stansted airports, arguing that airlines should make greater use of the UK&#x27;s regional airports, though some regional airports themselves have expressed concern about being adversely affected by capacity shortages in the South East. Villiers favours construction of a high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham and Manchester, arguing that flyers could use capacity at airports such as Birmingham International and Manchester International Airport.

In May 2017, Villiers announced that she fundamentally supports the ban on hunting of wild animals with dogs but suggested that there remains scope for reform of the Hunting Act 2004.

In September 2019 at that year&#x27;s Conservative Party Conference, Villiers set out plans to end live exports of farm animals, ban primates from being kept as pets and for cats to be microchipped.

In 2022, Villiers spearheaded opposition to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#x27;s plan to set housebuilding targets for councils to alleviate the housing shortage in the United Kingdom. In a 2023 interview, Villers said that denser housing, such as the apartment buildings proposed to be built near the Cockfosters station on the Piccadilly line would turn the London suburbs into &quot;East Berlin.&quot; She argued that dense housing construction would not be &quot;positive for the environment or for social cohesion.&quot; Critics have called her the &quot;nimby queen&quot; of British politics, to which she responded that the term NIMBY is &quot;term of abuse rather than engaging in a debate about how we deliver the homes we need in a sustainable way&quot;.

==Controversies==
In August 2023 it was revealed that Villiers had failed to declare she held shares worth over £70,000 in the oil and gas company, Shell, whilst serving as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

==Personal life==
Villiers married fellow barrister Sean Wilken in 1997, and the following year they co-wrote a book on matters of contract and quasi-contract law, which was published by a major publishing house. They divorced in 2006.

<text>Manhunt is a 2003 stealth game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released for the PlayStation 2 in November 2003, followed by Microsoft Windows and Xbox releases in April 2004. Set within the fictional Carcer City, players control a death row inmate who is forced to participate in a series of snuff films by killing criminal gang members sent to hunt him on camera.

The game received positive reviews from critics, with praise towards its dark tone and violent gameplay, although the combat and level design were criticized. Due to its graphic violence, &quot;Manhunt&quot; was subject to a significant video game controversy and banned in several countries. It was also implicated in a murder by the UK media, although this accusation was later rejected by the police and courts. While not a commercial hit, &quot;Manhunt&quot; developed a substantial cult following and was followed by a stand-alone sequel, &quot;Manhunt 2&quot;, in 2007. The game was re-released through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in 2013 and PlayStation 4 in 2016.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Manhunt&quot; is a stealth game played from a third-person perspective. The game consists of twenty levels, called &quot;scenes&quot;, as well as four unlockable bonus scenes. Players survive the scenes by dispatching enemy gang members, occasionally with firearms, but primarily by stealthily executing them. At the end of each scene, players are graded based on their performance, and awarded one to five stars. Unlockable content becomes available when the player achieves three or more stars on a certain number of levels. On normal difficulty (called &quot;Fetish&quot;), players can earn only four stars; one is awarded for completing the scene under a certain amount of time, and one to three stars are awarded based on the brutality of the executions carried out during the scene. On hard difficulty (called &quot;Hardcore&quot;), players are graded out of five stars; one for speed, one to three for brutality and one for completing the scene. To gain the maximum number of stars, a set number of brutal executions must be carried out over the course of each scene; face-to-face fighting does not award stars.

To carry out executions, players must approach a hunter from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each scene is full of &quot;dark spots&quot;, shadows where the player can hide. Enemies cannot see into the shadows, unless they see the player actually entering the area. A standard technique in the game is to hide in the shadows and tap a wall to attract the attention of a nearby hunter. When the hunter has examined the area and is moving away, players can easily ambush and execute them. The game has three levels of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last: &quot;hasty&quot; executions are quick and not very bloody, &quot;violent&quot; are considerably more gory, and &quot;gruesome&quot; are over-the-top blood-soaked murders. Players are in control of which level they use; once players have locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the three levels: white, yellow and red.

Over the course of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, including plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game firearms are available for use when executions become impractical. Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. &quot;Manhunt&quot; makes use of the PlayStation 2&#x27;s optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies and hear director&#x27;s command through the Headset directly. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect and immersion of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
&quot;Manhunt&quot; is set in the fictional Carcer City, a dilapidated rust belt city rife with corruption and crime. On the prowl around the city are numerous violent gangs, who seek to find and kill the player. The game is set in a shared universe with the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series.

===Plot===
In 2003 in Carcer City, a journalist (Kate Miller) reports about James Earl Cash (Stephen Wilfong), a death row inmate who has been recently executed by lethal injection. However, Cash was only sedated, and awakens to an unknown voice referring to himself as &quot;The Director&quot; (Brian Cox), who gives him instructions through an earpiece. The Director promises Cash his freedom, but only if he kills &quot;Hunters&quot; – gang members sent to hunt him – in special areas around Carcer City filmed by CCTV. Cash is first pitted against the Hoods, a gang of dangerous criminals and corrupt police officers patrolling an abandoned area of the city. After eliminating them, he is abducted by the Cerberus, the Director&#x27;s personal security unit, who take him to another part of Carcer City.

While the Director monitors his actions, Cash is forced to kill more criminals across various abandoned locations, encountering a skinhead gang called the Skinz, a sadistic paramilitary group called the Wardogs, an outlaw gang called the Innocentz (consisting of the mostly Hispanic occultist Skullyz and the Babyfaces consisting of pedophiles and mentally challenged murderers), and a group of former asylum inmates called the Smileys. Eventually, the Director betrays Cash and, after ordering his family&#x27;s deaths, tries to murder him as well, as part of his film&#x27;s climax. Cash survives the trap, and escapes after vowing revenge on the Director.

The remaining Wardogs, led by the Director&#x27;s right-hand man Ramirez (Chris McKinney), are sent to re-capture Cash, and they manage to trap him in a game of cat and mouse. Cash prevails and kills Ramirez and his men, before being rescued by the journalist reporting on him, who reveals that the Director is Lionel Starkweather, a former film producer from Los Santos who produces for a snuff film ring. The journalist has acquired enough evidence against Starkweather to get him convicted, but needs Cash to escort her to her apartment to get it. Meanwhile, Starkweather blackmails corrupt police chief Gary Schaffer into sending his men to kill Cash and the journalist, but the two manage to avoid them. After retrieving the evidence, Cash tells the journalist to leave the city with it while he goes after Starkweather.

Pursued by the police and SWAT throughout the subway and the streets, Cash is eventually cornered in a train yard and almost summarily executed. He is saved by the Cerberus, who kill the SWAT officers and take Cash to Starkweather&#x27;s mansion so that they can execute him themselves. The Cerberus are distracted when Piggsy (Hunter Platin), a chainsaw-wielding maniac (who Starkweather has kept chained up in the attic of the mansion), breaks free. Cash escapes and confronts Piggsy in the mansion&#x27;s upper levels. Unable to fight him directly, Cash uses stealth attacks on Piggsy before tricking him into standing on a grate, which collapses under his weight, allowing Cash to take his chainsaw and finish him off with it. After eliminating the remaining Cerberus, Cash confronts Starkweather in his office and kills him with the chainsaw.

The media and police arrive at the mansion as the journalist exposes Starkweather&#x27;s snuff ring and police complicity, leading to Schaffer being criminally prosecuted for corruption. Cash, however, is nowhere to be found.

==Development==
Rockstar North began development of &quot;Manhunt&quot; in the mid-early nineties, building the game with the RenderWare engine that had been used for the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; titles. In September 2003, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; published a preview of &quot;Manhunt&quot;, commenting &quot;[Rockstar North has] scraped its imagination to further twist the way games are made in the future and delivers a chiseled, no-apologies assault on gaming standards. [...] it possesses a warped subtlety that questions game reality... It creates a barren, harsh, violent experience and then punctures it with something trippy and darkly comic...&quot; In a retrospective piece, a former Rockstar employee admitted that the game almost caused a mutiny in the company, saying that the team had &quot;already weathered plenty of controversy over &quot;GTA III&quot; and &quot;Vice City&quot;—we were no strangers to it—but &quot;Manhunt&quot; felt different. With &quot;GTA&quot;, we always had the excuse that the gameplay was untethered—you never had to hurt anybody that wasn&#x27;t a &quot;bad guy&quot; in one of the missions. You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up&quot;.

&quot;Manhunt&quot; was announced at E3 in May 2003. The game was originally slated for an October release date, and it was eventually released for the PlayStation 2 on November 19, 2003, in North America, followed by a European release on November 21. During its first month on sale, the game sold 75,000 copies in the United States, &quot;a fraction&quot; of the copies sold by &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, games also distributed by Rockstar. In spite of these comparatively poor sales, the game received a port for Windows and the Xbox, released in North America on April 20, 2004, and in Europe on April 23. Rockstar released exclusive merchandise, limited editions and pre-order bonuses such as official soundtracks, a Piggsy figure, and a handheld voice changer.

The game was added to Steam in January 2008. &quot;Manhunt&quot; was included for free for players who pre-ordered the PC version of &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; in November 2009. On May 14, 2013, &quot;Manhunt&quot; was made available for purchase on the PlayStation 3 under the PlayStation Network&#x27;s PS2 Classics category. It was released again for the PlayStation 4 on March 22, 2016, with 1080p and trophy support.

==Reception==
The PlayStation 2 and PC versions of &quot;Manhunt&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, while the Xbox version received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. As of March 26, 2008, the &quot;Manhunt&quot; series has sold 1.7 million copies worldwide. At the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the game was nominated for &quot;Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;. &quot;Manhunt&quot; received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

The game&#x27;s dark nihilistic tone and violent nature were singled out by many critics as representing something unique in the world of video gaming. &quot;GameSpot&quot; concluded that, &quot;like it or not, the game pushes the envelope of video game violence and shows you countless scenes of wholly uncensored, heavily stylized carnage&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; praised the PS2 version&#x27;s audacity and competent technical capabilities, stating &quot;it&#x27;s a frightening premise that places gamers in a psychological impasse. The crimes that you commit are unspeakable, yet the gameplay that leads to these horrendous acts is so polished and fierce that it&#x27;s thrilling.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; complimented the same console version&#x27;s overall challenge, calling it a &quot;solid, deep experience for seasoned gamers pining for some hardcore, challenging games&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; gave the same console version eight out of ten, saying, &quot;Like &quot;GTA&quot; there&#x27;s more to this than shock and awe. Within its linear structure there is a lot of freedom within which to act, much more so than both &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, the titles which &quot;Manhunt&quot; most closely resembles.&quot;

&quot;Toronto Star&quot; writer Ben Rayner, praised the relevance of the game, defending its violence and graphic nature as very much a product of its time, and condemning calls to have it banned; 

As entertainment and cultural artefact, &quot;Manhunt&quot; is totally disturbing. But so is the evening news, the &quot;I&#x27;ll eat anything for money&quot; lunacy of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; and the unfettered, misanthropic gunplay of &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, so I will defend until my last breath Rockstar&#x27;s right to sell this stuff to me and anyone else who wants it. ... Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences, particularly for young people? As always, I remain agnostic on the matter. Who knows, really? The debate will never be resolved. The American military obviously thinks there&#x27;s something there: The troubling new TV ad campaign for the U.S. reserves lures potential young soldiers with tales of adventure accompanied by blatant, video-game-styled animation. And, curiously, no one has complained about or tried to ban &quot;SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs&quot;, in which stealth and killing figure even more heavily than in &quot;Manhunt&quot;.
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was especially complimentary of the game, arguing that it marked a significant moment in video gaming history;

&quot;Manhunt&quot; is easily the most violent game ever made. It will likely be dismissed by many as a disgusting murder simulator with no reason to exist. But &quot;Manhunt&quot; also is the &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; of video games, holding your eyes open so as to not miss a single splatter – asking you, is this really what you enjoy watching? Had &quot;Manhunt&quot; been poorly made, using the snuff film angle as a cheap gimmick, the game would have been shameful and exploitative. What elevates it to a grotesque, chilling work of art is both presentation and game play. &quot;Manhunt&quot; is solid as a game; it&#x27;s engaging to use stealth as you creep through the streets of this wicked city, using your smarts to avoid death, while dishing out much of your own. If &quot;Manhunt&quot; succeeds at retail, it will say more about America&#x27;s fascination with violence than any political discourse or social debate. That makes &quot;Manhunt&quot; the most important video game of the last five years.
The game received some criticism. Certain gameplay elements, such as the shooting mechanics, were called &quot;frustrating&quot; by &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, who claimed that &quot;more than half the time the targeting reticule refuses to acknowledge an oncoming enemy until they&#x27;re virtually in front of you.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; concurred, noting that the &quot;AI is much worse in the more action-oriented levels&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; said that one quickly became &quot;tired of [the] violence ... AI quirks [and] repetitive level design.&quot;

==Controversy==

The controversy surrounding the game stems primarily from the graphic manner in which the player executes enemies. In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game&#x27;s staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; &quot;there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game.&quot; Williams explained that the game &quot;just made us all feel icky. It was all about the violence, and it was realistic violence. We all knew there was no way we could explain away that game. There was no way to rationalize it. We were crossing a line.&quot;

The violence in the game drew the attention of U.S. Representative Joe Baca, who was the sponsor of a legislation to fine those who sell adult-themed games to players younger than 17. Baca said of &quot;Manhunt&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s telling kids how to kill someone, and it uses vicious, sadistic and cruel methods to kill&quot;. The media was drawn into the debate. For example, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Manhunt&quot; is a venal disconnect for the genre. There&#x27;s no challenge, just assembly-line, ritualistic slaughter. It&#x27;s less a video game and more a weapon of personal destruction. This is about stacking bodies. Perhaps the scariest fact of all: &quot;Manhunt&quot; is so user-friendly that any sharp 12-year-old could navigate through the entire game in one sitting.&quot;

===Murder of Stefan Pakeerah===
On July 28, 2004, the game was linked to the murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by 17-year-old Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc&#x27;s bedroom. Giselle and Patrick Pakeerah, the victim&#x27;s parents, claimed that the game had influenced LeBlanc and played a role in the murder. The Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers&#x27; Association (ELSPA) offered sympathy to the Pakeerah family but rejected any connection between the game and the murder. ELSPA also noted that the game was rated 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and was not intended for minors. Due to controversy, the game was removed from shelves by some vendors, including Game and Dixons. In response, Rockstar reiterated that it was intended for adults and denied any link to the murder. Media speculation of a potential ban on the game increased demand for it at physical and online retailers. Giselle Pakeerah stated her disappointment over the increased interest in the game.

On July 30, 2004, American attorney Jack Thompson, an advocate against violence in video games, claimed to have warned Rockstar prior to the game&#x27;s release that it could inspire copycat killings. On August 2, 2004, it was reported that the Pakeerahs had hired Thompson to represent them in a £50 million wrongful death claim against Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) and Rockstar Games. That day, the police officially denied any link between the game and the murder, citing drug-related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah&#x27;s bedroom, not Leblanc&#x27;s as originally reported. At the conclusion of the investigation, the police reaffirmed that they could not find sufficient evidence linking the game to the murder. The presiding judge placed sole responsibility with Leblanc after sentencing him to life. The Pakeerahs&#x27; case against SCE and Rockstar was dropped soon thereafter.

There was renewed controversy after the announcement of &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; in February 2007, with the Pakeerahs condemning its release. Rockstar&#x27;s parent company Take-Two Interactive issued a statement that &quot;the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police&quot; in the case had refuted any connection to the game. Jack Thompson unsuccessfully attempted to have &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; banned, claiming that Take-Two had lied about the incident and that police were incorrect in asserting the game had belonged to Pakeerah.

===Legal status===
In New Zealand, the game was banned on December 11, 2003, with possession deemed an offence. Bill Hastings, the Chief Censor, stated &quot;it&#x27;s a game where the only thing you do is kill everybody you see ... You have to at least acquiesce in these murders and possibly tolerate, or even move towards enjoying them, which is injurious to the public good.&quot; In 2023, the Office reconsidered &quot;Manhunt&quot; and classified it R18.

In Australia, the game was initially allowed under a MA15+ classification, but this decision was reversed by the Australian Classification Board in September 2004, after an appeal by the Attorney-General Philip Ruddock. As a consequence, the game was effectively banned, mandating a recall of all copies still being sold in stores. Before its recall, &quot;Manhunt&quot; had already sold 18,000 units in Australia.

In Canada, following a meeting in Toronto on December 22, 2003, between Hastings and officials from the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Business Services, &quot;Manhunt&quot; became the first video game in Ontario to be classified as a film and was restricted to adults on February 3, 2004. Apart from Ontario, however, &quot;Manhunt&quot; had little or no classification problems elsewhere in North America. The British Columbia Film Classification Office reviewed the game after the controversy in Ontario and deemed the Mature rating by the ESRB to be appropriate.

In Germany, the Amtsgericht in Munich confiscated the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Manhunt&quot; on July 19, 2004, for violation of § 131 StGB (&quot;representation of violence&quot;). According to the court, the game portrays the killing of humans as fun. They also said it glorified vigilantism, which they considered harmful. All other versions got indexed.

=== Steam release crack protection issues ===
To combat piracy, the retail version contained two layers of digital rights management (DRM): the SecuROM system and several game-breaking mechanisms that are activated when SecuROM is missing. To ship the game to Steam without third party DRM, Rockstar Games re-released it with an existing crack by Razor 1911. As this was uncovered in 2010, the company quickly released a new version of the retail release with only SecuROM removed. The proprietary measures were not addressed, leading to a broken version being sold on Steam. Prior to 2023, the crack protection mechanisms, such as gates and doors not working properly blocking progress through the game, were interpreted as issues with compatibility on newer operating systems. However, it was discovered the Steam release had crack protection measures active despite being an official release due to the incomplete removal of the DRM. Reviews on Steam then appeared complaining about the anti-piracy measures and originally being sold a cracked version of the game. This version remains unaltered as of September 2023.

==Legacy==

&quot;Manhunt&quot; has garnered a cult following among fans, and was cited by a &quot;Vice&quot; article in March 2016 as one of Rockstar&#x27;s &quot;very best&quot; games. Likewise, &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered the game a &quot;dark, underappreciated masterpiece&quot;. It was recognised as an example of the &quot;best of gaming horror&quot; by &quot;VentureBeat&quot; in October 2011, included in the &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot; in 2010, and listed at #85 in &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games&quot; that same year.

A sequel, &quot;Manhunt 2&quot;, was released in October 2007 in the United States and October 2008 in Europe. Although the sequel retains many of the stealth elements used in its predecessor, &quot;Manhunt 2&quot;″s storyline is completely unrelated to the first game.

The Sunday Times carried a two page spread on Dr Tannock. Tannock reported the Sunday Thames to the Press Complaints Commission http://www.pcc.org.uk/cases/adjudicated.html?article=Nzg4OA==
but his complaint was rejected and the Sunday Times was vindicated in making claims that share options were not effectively declared in a now liquidated fracking company but had made it clear that the EU Parliament authorities had cleared Tannock of any breach of its rules on declaration of members&#x27; interests.

Tannock was Rapporteur, shadow Rapporteur and co-author on numerous Reports and Joint Resolutions of the European Parliament over his 20 years as MEP. 

Notably in 2004 he was Rapporteur on the AFET Committee for the European Neighbourhood Policy Report and again in 2007 AFET Rapporteur for the Eastern Partnership Dimension of the ENP.

Following the 2016 UK EU Referendum result Tannock wrote three ECR booklets on the critical UK internal and external security implications of Brexit as well as the consequences of Brexit in Ireland. They are published as &quot;Brexit: The Security Dimension&quot; in early 2017, &quot;The Case for a New WEU&quot; in 2018, and a &quot;Hong Kong in Ireland: Northern Ireland&#x27;s Brexit Opportunity&quot; in late 2018. In November 2020 he coedited with Alistair Burt the Conservative Group for Europe Publication: &quot;European Britain Global Britain: Foreign Affairs and International Relations Post-Brexit&quot; which sets out a vision for UK working more closely with its EU partners on Foreign Policy, Defence and Security matters globally.

A pro-European, Tannock applied for, and obtained, Irish citizenship in response to Brexit, describing himself as a &quot;pretty angry pro-European Tory&quot;. Tannock also stated with regards to what has happened since the Brexit referendum that &quot;I am quite ashamed to be British in many ways&quot;, speaking in regards to the treatment of EU citizens. He told &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that he was proud to be Irish and was planning a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; to Ireland.

Tannock is a founder of #Masks4All, and co-signed an open letter of 100 Doctors titled &quot;why are we still prevaricating over face masks&quot;?

In January 2021 Tannock did not renew his membership of the UK Conservative Party and now declares himself free of all party affiliation and a floating voter at the next General Election.

== Psychiatric career and retirement abroad==
Before being elected to the European Parliament, he was a Consultant psychiatrist at University College Hospital and Honorary Senior Lecturer at UCL Medical School. He was assistant Research Secretary of the Bow Group from 1989 to 1990, publishing Bow Group papers and made several contributions to the scientific literature particularly in the field of chronic fatigue syndrome and anxiety disorders as a medical researcher. After losing his seat in July 2019 as an MEP Tannock returned to part-time clinical practice in the NHS as a Consultant Psychiatrist in London. He finally retired in 2022 when he quit the UK to live with his family in Slovakia. In Bratislava he became in 2022 a Senior Associate Fellow at Globsec, the premier Slovak NGO dealing with international relations and global security. He also is involved in supporting the Irish and Portuguese diaspora communities in Slovakia.

<doc id="723918" wikidata="Q3075664" url="?curid=723918" title="James Murdoch (Scottish Orientalist)">
<text>James Murdoch (27 September 1856 – 30 October 1921) was a Scottish Orientalist scholar and journalist, who worked as a teacher in the Empire of Japan and Australia. From 1903 to 1917, he wrote his &quot;monumental&quot; three-volume &quot;A History of Japan&quot;, the first comprehensive history of Japan in the English language (the third volume being published posthumously in 1926). In 1917 he began teaching Japanese at the University of Sydney and in 1918 he was appointed the foundation professor of the School of Oriental Studies there.

==Early life==
James Murdoch was born in the Kirktown of Fetteresso, a village on the outskirts of Stonehaven, near Aberdeen, Scotland. His parents were William Murdoch, a labourer, and his wife Helen, née McDonald.

He exhibited signs of intellectual brilliance as a child, and although his family was of moderate means, he won a scholarship to Aberdeen University where he completed a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree. He subsequently studied at Worcester College, Oxford University, the University of Göttingen (where he studied Sanskrit under Theodor Benfey), and the University of Paris. In June 1860 he took up a post as assistant to the professor of Greek at Aberdeen.

Regarded as a genius in foreign languages, at the age of 24, he suddenly resigned from his post and decided to emigrate to Australia.

==Life in Australia==
Murdoch taught in Queensland, Australia in the years 1881–1889. His first appointment was as the headmaster of the new Maryborough Boys Grammar School. He had been chosen from among 130 applicants for the position but became unpopular with the trustees (possibly because of his atheism), and he was dismissed in March 1885. He worked for the next two years as assistant master at Brisbane Grammar School. In 1886, he also sat for the Bar examinations but failed in two of the eight papers because he had mistakenly attempted to answer every question. He left the school at his own wish and became a journalist at the radical nationalist newspaper, &quot;The Boomerang&quot;. In a series of articles, he predicted that within a generation the Australian colonies would form an independent republic, which would turn socialist through a violent revolution unless the harsh living conditions of the working classes were alleviated.

==Life in Japan==
Murdoch came to Japan as a foreign advisor, from September 1889 – 1893 as a professor of European history at the First Higher School, an elite institution for young men entering the Tokyo Imperial University. His most famous student during his first period in Japan was Natsume Sōseki.

In addition to teaching, he vigorously pursued literary activities. In June 1890 he published a long piece of satirical verse, &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Grandson in Japan&quot;. In November he launched a weekly magazine, the &quot;Japan Echo&quot;, which lasted for six issues. In 1892 he published &quot;From Australia and Japan&quot; (a volume of short stories which went through three editions) and a novel, &quot;Ayame-san&quot;. His stories were romances in which the heroes tended to be academic and sporting paragons with socialist political leanings, whereas the women were both mercenary and cruel, or paragons of erudition, beauty and good breeding. He also wrote several texts for pictorial guidebooks aimed at historically minded tourists, and edited the memoirs of Hikozo Hamada, the castaway who became the first Japanese to acquire American citizenship.

==Life in Paraguay and London==
In August 1893, Murdoch left Japan to join the New Australia communist experimental commune in Paraguay (the commune had been founded by William Lane who had also founded &quot;The Boomerang&quot;). On 1 September, he was reported to be in London, on his way to New Australia to organize the schools there. By the time of his arrival, however, about one-third of the colonists had seceded, and far from the socialist paradise he had imagined, he found only poverty, dissention, and disease. He remained only a few days and, leaving his 12-year-old son Kenneth in South America, returned to London in ill health.

He spent the next five months recuperating at the British Museum, translating the letters of sixteenth-century European religious in Japan; he then returned to Japan, where he would live until 1917.

==Return to Japan==
From 1894 to 1897 Murdoch taught English at the Fourth Higher School (today&#x27;s Kanazawa University) at Kanazawa, Ishikawa prefecture. On 23 November 1899, while teaching economic history at the Higher Commercial College (today&#x27;s Hitotsubashi University) in Tokyo, he married Takeko Okada.

In 1901 Murdoch moved to the Seventh Higher School at Kagoshima, Kyūshū. He had never fully recovered from the illness he had contracted in South America and he hoped to benefit from the milder Kyūshū winters. &quot;A History of Japan During the Century of Early Foreign Intercourse (1542–1651)&quot; appeared in 1903. The European language sources in Latin, Spanish, French and Dutch were all translated by himself. Lafcadio Hearn praised the book in the &quot;Bibliographical Notes&quot; section of his book &quot;Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation&quot; (1904).

In 1908, Murdoch&#x27;s teaching contract was not renewed. Murdoch, nevertheless, decided to remain at Kagoshima. He contributed regularly to the &quot;Kobe Chronicle&quot; newspaper and, to supplement this income, planted a citron orchard. Although he was never to achieve fluency in speech, he had now become so proficient in classical written Japanese that he no longer had to rely on assistants. &quot;A History of Japan From the Origins to the Arrival of the Portuguese in 1542 A.D.&quot; appeared in 1910. In 1915, following the completion of the manuscript of the third volume, &quot;The Tokugawa Epoch 1652–1868&quot;, poverty forced Murdoch back into teaching, this time at the junior high-school level.

==Return to Australia==
In February 1917, however, Murdoch was able to return to Australia to teach Japanese at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and at the University of Sydney (where he founded the Japanese studies program), concurrent appointments instituted on the initiative of the Australian Defense Department. The following year, in response to an effort made by Waseda University to bring him back to Japan, the University of Sydney raised his status to that of a fully tenured professor and as the founding professor of the Chair of Oriental Studies. In return for £600 a year from the Defense Department, the university also permitted Murdoch to visit Japan annually to obtain first-hand information on shifts in Japanese public opinion and foreign policy. The first such visit resulted in a memorandum highly critical of Australia&#x27;s intransigence on the racial equality issue raised by Japan at the Paris Peace Conference. Similarly, two years later Murdoch was called to Melbourne to give the Prime Minister of Australia his views on the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.

Murdoch died of liver cancer at his home at on 30 October 1921. He had just completed the research for the fourth volume of the &quot;A History of Japan&quot; but had not begun writing. He was survived by his son (in South America) and by his wife (who returned to Japan). His successor in the Chair of Oriental Studies was Arthur Lindsay Sadler.

==James Murdoch prize==
The University of Sydney gives an annual award, the James Murdoch Prize for Japanese 4, to high-achieving students in Japanese.

<text>Timothy John Robert Kirkhope, Baron Kirkhope of Harrogate (born 29 April 1945) is a British lawyer and politician who previously served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Yorkshire and the Humber for the Conservative Party. After serving for ten years as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leeds North East, he was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999. Between December 2004 and November 2010 he was leader of the Conservative delegation for a total of six years. He was the chairman of the Conservative Friends of Israel&#x27;s Europe grouping, the European Conservatives Spokesman on Justice and Home Affairs, and a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s U.S Delegation. In 2016, he was created a life peer.

==Biography==
Kirkhope was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, and educated at the independent Royal Grammar School, Newcastle and subsequently at the Law Society College of Law in Guildford before qualifying as a solicitor in 1973. He was a senior partner in Newcastle law firm Wilkinson Marshall Clayton and Gibson (now part of Eversheds) until election to Parliament in 1987. He still maintains a Solicitors Practising Certificate.

In 1982 he was elected to Northumberland County Council for one term and served as a director of Newcastle International Airport. He obtained his Private Pilot&#x27;s Licence in 1983. He was very active in the Free Radio movement and a co-author of the Conservatives proposals for commercial radio in the late 1960s. He was then part of a consortium bidding for one of the first commercial radio licences when they became available. He has always had a strong interest in Hospital Broadcasting having been the chairman of Radio Tyneside for some years, and has maintained his links with that organisation. He was also very active in charitable work for the Macmillan Cancer Relief organization in Newcastle and the Family Service Unit movement.

==House of Commons==
Kirkhope first stood for Parliament for Durham at the February 1974 General Election, but came second (with 27.07%) to the Labour incumbent Mark Hughes, although the voting swing in the constituency was surprisingly one of the biggest towards the Conservatives in the UK, at these &quot;Miners&quot; elections. In 1979 he contested Darlington, but was narrowly defeated by Labour&#x27;s Ted Fletcher.

At the 1987 general election, Kirkhope followed Sir Keith Joseph as the Member of Parliament for Leeds North East. He was made Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Trippier at the Department of the Environment in 1989. In the same year, he introduced in his name, and saw passed, a private members&#x27; bill (the Parking Act 1989) which was designed to help motorists use new methods like debit cards to pay for their parking needs. He became a Government Assistant Whip in 1990, then a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury in 1992, and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household in 1995 reporting on the business of the House of Commons directly to HM The Queen, whilst serving as whip.

In October 1995 Kirkhope received promotion to be Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office responsible for immigration, border controls, gambling and licensing policy, and horseracing, among other things.

He was defeated at the 1997 general election, his constituency attracting some interest because its majority had placed it at the point where a Labour gain would indicate that that party was likely to win an overall majority, which it did. Kirkhope then returned to legal practice and also went into business. He was a non-executive director of the Bournemouth and West Hants Water Company for some years, and then more recently has been, and remains, a member on the board of a company pension trust.

==European Parliament==
In June 1999 he was elected to the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber becoming the Conservative spokesman on justice and home affairs and the Chief Whip of the delegation that year. He also served on the Culture, Media, Arts Education and Youth Committee between 1999 and 2002. Then, in 2002, he became the Conservative Party representative on the Convention on the Future of Europe, established to consider the future course for Europe. In the course of that work he was one of those responsible for the proposal of what would become Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2005. In 2002, he was re-selected by Conservative members in Yorkshire and The Humber to head the list of candidates in the European elections in June 2004.

In spring 2003, Kirkhope was asked by the then Shadow Home Secretary Oliver Letwin to look into the workings of the UK asylum system and to make proposals for future party policy. The Kirkhope Commission worked for several months and produced a comprehensive report with 20 specific recommendations.

In July 2004, Kirkhope was elected as the first Vice-Chairman of the EPP/European Democrats Parliamentary Group with which the UK Conservatives were in alliance at the time. After the success of his Asylum Commission, he was also asked to head another UK commission on immigration. The report that followed was presented to the then Shadow Home Secretary David Davis during the summer of 2004.

In December 2004, Kirkhope was elected Leader of the Conservative Delegation in the European Parliament. He was defeated in the Leadership election in November 2007 but was then re-elected in 2009. During his total of 6 years as the leader of the delegation Kirkhope sat on the Conservative Party Board in London.

In June 2009 Kirkhope helped to set up (with the Rt. Hon. William Hague), and then became the interim chairman of, a new European Parliament group the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) of which the UK Conservatives became founding members moving from their alliance with the EPP. He was then a candidate to become the permanent chairman of the bloc but he chose to step aside in favour of Polish MEP Michał Kamiński after Kamiński was denied one of the vice president of the European Parliament positions by then-Conservative Edward McMillan-Scott deciding to stand as an Independent without the support of his delegation or the new group. Kirkhope was appointed deputy chairman of the ECR Group by Kamiński in return for his gesture. He stood again for the presidency after Kamiński stepped down 2 years later but was controversially defeated by Martin Callanan. Further steps to assume a leading role in the group were rebuffed.

Kirkhope continued as Justice and Home Affairs spokesman with strong interests in the EP/USA delegation and was re-appointed to these roles following the 2014 European Elections where he again led the Party list in Yorkshire and the Humber.

==House of Lords==
Following the referendum vote for Britain to leave the European Union 2016, David Cameron resigned as prime minister. His resignation honours list named Kirkhope as an nominee for a life peerage. In the afternoon of 1 September Kirkhope was created Baron Kirkhope of Harrogate, of Harrogate in the County of North Yorkshire. Peers are disqualified from sitting and voting in the House of Lords while serving as a Member of the European Parliament by virtue of sections 3 and 4 of the European Parliament (House of Lords Disqualification) Regulations 2008. And so Kirkhope relinquished his position as MEP.

Following his introduction in the House of Lords, he has subsequently become a Member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Sub-Committee on EU Home Affairs, and is a member of the British American Parliamentary Group. He maintains his involvement with Classic Cars as an active member of the Parliamentary Historic Vehicles Group.

==Personal life==
Kirkhope holds a pilot&#x27;s licence, collects classic cars, swims and plays tennis. He is married and has four grown up sons. He lives near Harrogate in North Yorkshire.

Lord Kirkhope became a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Plumbers in 2020 and Freeman of the City of London in 2021.

<doc id="723930" wikidata="Q881135" url="?curid=723930" title="Julius Sterling Morton">
<text>Julius Sterling Morton (April 22, 1832 – April 27, 1902) was a Nebraska newspaper editor and politician who served as President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s secretary of agriculture. He was a prominent Bourbon Democrat, taking a conservative position on political, economic, and social issues, and opposing agrarianism. Among his most notable achievements was the founding of Arbor Day in 1872. In 1897 he started a weekly magazine entitled &quot;The Conservative&quot;.

==Early life==
Morton was born on April 22, 1832, in the town of Adams in Jefferson County, New York; his parents, Julius Dewey Morton and Emeline Sterling Morton, ran a general store. In 1834, his parents and his grandfather, Abner Morton, moved to Monroe, Michigan, south of Detroit on Lake Erie; there, Morton&#x27;s grandfather and his paternal uncle Edward Morton operated a newspaper. When he was fourteen, Morton&#x27;s parents sent him to Wesleyan Seminary in Albion, Michigan, about northwest.

In 1850, Morton enrolled in the University of Michigan. In his junior year he attempted to launch a new periodical, the &quot;Peninsular Quarterly and University Magazine&quot;, which proved short-lived. He was an active member of the Chi Psi fraternity, and opposed an attempt by the faculty to discourage such secret societies.

In May 1854, six weeks before Morton was due to graduate, the university&#x27;s Board of Regents dismissed the head of the medical department, Dr. J. Adams Allen, a popular faculty member. That evening, Morton, a friend and admirer of Allen&#x27;s, addressed a mass meeting protesting Allen&#x27;s dismissal and other seemingly autocratic actions taken by university officials. The following day, Morton was expelled from the university, ostensibly for excessive absences and for general inattention to his duties as a student. His expulsion prompted protests from the student body and across the state. He was readmitted after signing a very conditional document, stating that if the charges against him had been true, then his expulsion would have been justified. The readmission did not last. The university president, Henry Philip Tappan, released a version of his statement from which the conditionals had been removed, making it a straightforward admission of fault. Morton wrote a letter to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; in which he retracted his original statement, declaring that he had not &quot;...meanly petitioned, implored and besought the Faculty for mercy, for... the Latin-scratched integument of a dead sheep.&quot; He was re-expelled and not allowed to graduate with his class. In 1856, under unclear circumstances, he was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Arts degree by Union College of Schenectady, New York; in 1858, the University of Michigan faculty reversed his expulsion and awarded him a diploma.

==Nebraska==
At the age of 22, in fall 1854, he moved with his bride, Caroline Joy French, to the Nebraska Territory, and in 1855 purchased 160 acres in Nebraska City. Soon after arriving there, Morton became the editor of the local newspaper, the &quot;Nebraska City News&quot;. Morton served briefly in the Nebraska Territorial House of Representatives (1855–1856). He was appointed Secretary of Nebraska Territory by President James Buchanan on July 12, 1858, a position he held until 1861. The 26 year old Morton also served as Acting Governor of Nebraska from December 5, 1858, to May 2, 1859.

Morton moved to Nebraska City shortly after passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act to become a Democratic newspaper editor during the turbulent era of &quot;Bleeding Kansas,&quot; when southeast Nebraska was an important location for abolitionist mobilization and a stop on the Underground Railroad. Morton used his positions as newspaperman and Secretary of the territory to oppose the so-called &quot;Black Republicans&quot; in the legislature, often using racist arguments. During the Civil War he was a harsh critic of President Lincoln and was considered a racist, Southern-sympathizing, copperhead Democrat with questionable loyalty to the Union, although he supposedly opposed succession as well as abolition. After the war he helped make opposition to Black civil rights a leading issue for Democrats. 

In 1860, Morton ran for the office of Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from Nebraska. He was originally named the winner by 14 votes and issued a certificate of election by the Governor. But 7 months later and two months after his term began, amid considerable evidence of irregularities in frontier balloting on all sides, the Governor issued a superseding certificate of election to his opponent, the Republican abolitionist Samuel Gordon Daily. When the session of Congress began, it was decided that Daily should be sworn in. Morton contested the outcome, noting that the Governor issued the second certificate in secret, without the concurrence of the Board of Canvassers and without the proper seal. Some said that Daily&#x27;s certificate was a forgery. The House reviewed the election returns and rejected many votes, mostly for Morton. In the end they found that Daily had won by 150 votes.

Morton built a 30-room mansion. His son, Joy, expanded it to a 52-room mansion that is a look-alike of the White House in what is now Arbor Lodge State Historical Park, Nebraska City, Nebraska. On the surrounding estate, Morton indulged his fascination with trees, planting many rare varieties and heirloom apple trees. Respected as an agriculturalist, Morton sought to instruct people in the modern techniques of farming and forestry. Among his most significant achievements was the founding of Arbor Day. He is also remembered for his fierce opposition to cutting down healthy trees as Christmas decorations. He became well known in Nebraska for his political, agricultural, and literary activities and from there was appointed as United States Secretary of Agriculture by President Cleveland (1893–1897). He is credited with helping change that department into a coordinated service to farmers, and he supported Cleveland in setting up national forest reservations.

In 1897, Morton planned and began to edit the multi-volume &quot;Illustrated History of Nebraska&quot;. He also began publishing a weekly periodical, &quot;The Conservative&quot;&quot;.&quot; Morton died on April 27, 1902, in Lake Forest, Illinois, where he was seeking medical treatment; his wife, Caroline, had died two decades earlier, in June 1881. The Morton home and estate in Nebraska City are now a state park, the Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum.

In 1937, the state of Nebraska donated a bronze statue of Morton to the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. However, because of his long history of virulent, unapologetic, racism and political corruption, his statue was replaced by a statue of Willa Cather in 2023. Morton is a member of the Nebraska Hall of Fame, inducted in 1975. The J. Sterling Morton Beltway, a highway near Nebraska City, Nebraska, which is made up of U.S. Route 75 and Nebraska Highway 2, is named for him. J. Sterling Morton Magnet Middle School in Omaha, Nebraska, also bears his name, as do Morton College (a community college) and J. Sterling Morton High School District 201 in Berwyn and Cicero, Illinois.

His son, Joy Morton, is the founder of the Morton Salt Company, Chicago, Illinois. The son also created The Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois, in 1922. Today, Joy Morton&#x27;s original Thornhill Estate, which he acquired in 1910, has been transformed into a living history museum of over 4,000 different types of trees, shrubs, and other woody plants.

His son, Paul Morton, was a Vice President of the Santa Fe Railroad and President of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, and although J. Sterling was a Bourbon Democrat (i.e. conservative Democrat), Paul served as Secretary of the Navy under Teddy Roosevelt from 1904 to 1905 as a Progressive Republican.

<text>The Education Act 1496 (c. 87) was an act of the Parliament of Scotland that required landowners to send their eldest sons to school to study Latin, arts and law. This made schooling compulsory for the first time in the world.

The humanist intent was to ensure that local government lay in competent hands and to improve the administration of justice nationwide by making the legal system more responsive at the local level. The act states:
* all barons and substantial freeholders shall put their eldest sons and heirs into school from the age of 8 or 9.
* these shall remain in grammar schools under competent instruction until they have perfect Latin.
* They shall next spend three years at the schools of art and law.
* the purpose of this education is:
** that they have knowledge and understanding of the laws, for the benefit of justice throughout the realm.
** that those who become sheriffs or judges will have the knowledge to do justice.
** to eliminate the need of the poor to seek redress from the king&#x27;s principal auditors for each small injury (see Scottish Poor Laws).
* anyone who fails to do so without a lawful excuse shall pay the king the sum of £20 Scots.
The act was passed by the Parliament at Edinburgh on 13 June 1496 in the reign of James IV; in the 19th century, it remained in effect as one of the principal statutes for the management of schools under Scots law.

This act is sometimes referred to as the Education Act 1494; this is due to an error in some editions of the &quot;Acts of Parliament&quot;, where it is listed as 1494 James IV, c. 54.

<doc id="723960" wikidata="Q2036303" url="?curid=723960" title="Richard Ashworth">
<text>Richard James Ashworth (born 17 September 1947 in Folkestone) is a former British politician, who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England from 2004 until 2019. He formerly sat in the European Parliament for the Conservative Party, and was that party&#x27;s leader there from March 2012 to November 2013. In April 2019 Ashworth defected to Change UK, but was not elected to the European Parliament at the 2019 election held the following month.

==Background==
Ashworth was educated at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, and studied agriculture and management at Seale-Hayne College in Devon. He has been the chairman of a further education college (Plumpton in East Sussex) for a number of years as well as serving on several public bodies in the education sector. His interests include music, theatre, sport, aviation and country pursuits.

He was the Conservative parliamentary candidate for North Devon in 1997, and for the South East England constituency in the 1999 European Parliament election.

Before being elected in 2004, Ashworth was a dairy farmer in East Sussex for over thirty years, and during this time operated his own dairy business. He has also acted as chairman of United Milk Plc and of NFU Corporate. He was a member of the Minister of Agriculture&#x27;s food chain advisory committee.

==Conservative MEP==
He was elected to the European Parliament in 2004 and became the Conservative spokesperson on budgets. On 6 June 2008, Ashworth was appointed Conservative Chief Whip in the EP after his predecessor Den Dover was sacked following an expenses scandal. He was elected Deputy Leader of the Conservative Delegation to the European Parliament in November 2008 and Leader in 2012.

At the first stage of the Conservative Party reselection procedure ahead of the 2014 European Parliament election, he was not confirmed as going into the protected sitting members part of the ballot. This was seen as a &quot;coup&quot; by the right of the Conservative Party against their MEP leader, who was seen as being close to Cameron and a moderate on Europe.

Ashworth and fellow MEP Julie Girling were suspended from the Conservative Party and had the whip withdrawn on 7 October 2017, after both supported a vote in Strasbourg stating that not enough progress had been made in the first-stage Brexit negotiations to allow discussion to move onto the trade-deal phase of the talks; however, they remained in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) parliamentary group. On 28 February 2018, both left the ECR group to join the European People&#x27;s Party Group.

On 1 March 2018, Ashworth was one of three UK MEPs who voted against a motion to encourage national parliaments to ban &quot;gay conversion therapies&quot;; he issued a statement on 17 September 2018 that his vote was &quot;a mistake which I deeply regret&quot;, and pointing to his other votes that day in support of LGBT causes.

==Change UK==
On 16 April 2019, it was announced that he and fellow MEP Julie Girling had joined Change UK. However, Girling later declared support for the Liberal Democrats and stated that she had never actually joined Change UK. Ashworth was the first candidate on the list for Change UK in South East England at the 2019 European Parliament election, at which he failed to be elected.

<text>James Edmund Moncrieff Elles (born 3 September 1949 in London) is a former Conservative Party Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England.

Elles is the son of Diana Newcombe Elles, Baroness Elles and her husband, Neil Patrick Moncrieff Elles. He served as the MEP for Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire from 1984 to 1994, and following boundary changes for Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire East from 1994 to 1999. He then represented South East England in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2014. Elles had special responsibility for the Conservative Party for the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire.

In 2019 he published the book &#x27;Fiction, Fact and Future: The Essence of EU Democracy&#x27; as an author under the Haus Curiosities series of The University of Chicago Press.

==Early career==
He was educated at Eton College and the University of Edinburgh where he graduated with a BSc in agriculture. He became a European MP after an eight-year career as a civil servant with the European Commission, initially as a Tokyo Round negotiator and latterly as Assistant to the Deputy Director-General of Agriculture.

==Member of the European Parliament==
Elles served six terms in the European Parliament, his principal Committee being the Budgets Committee for the entire 30-year period. He was overall rapporteur on the EU budget for the years 1996 and 2007. During this period, he was also a substitute member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Budget Control Committee. He founded the Thames Valley European Forum, now renamed the South East Conservative European Network (SECEN), of which he is currently chairman.

==Transatlantic Policy Network (TPN)==
In 1992 he founded the Transatlantic Policy Network (TPN). The purpose of TPN is to help build bridges between the EU and the US involving business and policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic, feeding in ideas, for example, to create the new transatlantic agenda (NTA) in 1995 and, more recently, putting forward suggestions to strengthen transatlantic partnership through the completion of the transatlantic market from 2008 onwards. This has led to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) under negotiation between the EU and the U.S. since February 2013. He is currently Chairman of the Management Committee of the Network.

==European Internet Foundation (EIF)==
In 2000, Elles and two other parliamentarians, as co-founders, launched the European Internet Foundation (EIF). The purpose of the European Internet Foundation is to help encourage European political leadership in the development of active public policies that respond to the political, economic, and social challenges of the worldwide digital revolution. The EIF aims to ensure that the European Union remains open to developments in the digital economy and benefits fully from it through enhanced global competitiveness and social progress. Its most recent contribution to long-term thinking was contained in its document &quot;The Digital World in 2030: what place for Europe?&quot; in which it called for completing the Digital Single Market (March 2014). He remains a member of the EIF Steering Committee.

==European Ideas Network (EIN)==
In August 2002, Elles founded the European Ideas Network (EIN), an open network think-tank on a European scale for the centre-right. He stepped down as Chairman of the Network in March 2008.

==European Strategy and Policy Analysis System (ESPAS)==
Elles laid the foundation for creating the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System (ESPAS) by tabling two budget amendments in 2010 and 2012. Their purpose was to establish an inter-institutional system looking closely at long-term trends with a view to providing foresight, feeding in-principle ideas into strategic policy-making. It is governed by a Steering Group where all EU institutions are represented at Secretary-General or substitute level meetings on a regular basis where Elles is Honorary President.

<doc id="723970" wikidata="Q1343877" url="?curid=723970" title="Jacob Brønnum Scavenius Estrup">
<text>Jacob Brønnum Scavenius Estrup (16 April 1825 – 24 December 1913), was a Danish politician, member of the Højre party. He was Interior Minister from 1865 to 1869 in the Cabinet of Frijs and Council President as well as Finance Minister from 1875 to 1894 as the leader of the &quot;Estrup Cabinet&quot;. At 19 years, he was the longest serving Danish prime minister. 

From a Danish historical perspective, he is perhaps most famous (or infamous) for the so-called provisional time (&quot;provisorietiden&quot;) from 1885 to 1894. After a huge defeat in the 1884 &quot;Folketinget&quot; parliamentary election, in which the Højre party only gained 19 out of 102 seats, he simply refused to resign as Head of Government. (The title &quot;&quot;konseilspresident&quot; has later been changed to &quot;statsminister&quot; but both titles are equivalent to Prime Minister) He then wasn&#x27;t able to get parliamentary support for the imperative annual Financial Laws, he instead managed to bring about King Christian IX&#x27;s support for &quot;Provisional Financial Laws&quot;. This included support from the so-called &quot;Landstinget&quot; as well. The &quot;Landstinget&quot; was a smaller assembly of politicians, of which half of its members were chosen by the Monarch. A reason to why the Monarch agreed to nine such annual provisional laws, the King and Estrup both believed in the building of the Copenhagen defense wall (&quot;Københavns befæstning&quot;) at the time known as &quot;Vestencienten&quot;&quot; built between 1888 and 1892.

==Biography==
Estrup was son of the landowner and headmaster at Sorø Academy Hector Frederik Janson Estrup (1794–1846) and Jacobine Scavenius (1800–1829), daughter of Jacob Brønnum Scavenius (1749–1820).

He inherited the estate &quot;Kongsdal&quot; in Holbæk amt in 1846. In 1852 he also bought the estate Skaføgård in Randers.

As Interior Minister in the Cabinet of Frijs, Estrup took control of the railroads of Jutland and Funen, which had been ceded to an English consortium in 1861. He expanded the railroads in Vendsyssel and built new lines from Skanderborg to Silkeborg and along the west coast of Jutland to Esbjerg, earning him the nickname &quot;Railway Minister&quot;. He also built up the harbour in Esbjerg, which turned into an important center for exports. In 1869 he was forced to step down from his post because of health problems.

In 1875 Estrup was able to replace Christen Andreas Fonnesbech as Council President. Estrup himself also took the post as Finance Minister, perhaps the most important post as Denmark was economically worn down after the Second War of Schleswig. In 1877 Estrup was unable to secure support for his budget bill in Folketinget, as demanded by the Danish Constitution, but chose instead to issue it as a provisional law. This happened repeatedly in the years 1885 to 1894, the so-called provisional period (&quot;provisorietid&quot;). Among others he was opposed by the Venstre leaders Christen Berg and Viggo Hørup.

When an assassination attempt failed on 21 October 1885, Estrup responded by passing various laws restricting the press, restricting the right to own arms, and broadening the powers of the police. In 1894, Venstre and Estrup&#x27;s Højre cooperated to pass a budget bill, and Estrup resigned. He would not hold any future offices as a minister but retained significant influence in the following governments formed by Højre.

==Personal life==
He was decorated with the Order of the Elephant in 1878 with conferring rank of Grand Cross Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog and Dannebrogsmand. He was married in 1857 to Regitze Holsten-Charisius (1831-1896), daughter of Adam Christopher Holsten-Charisius. They were the parents of six children. Estrup died on Christmas Eve 1913 in Kongsdal and was buried at Undløse Church.

<text>Daniel John Hannan, Baron Hannan of Kingsclere (born 1 September 1971) is a British writer, journalist and politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England from 1999 to 2020. In 2021 he became a sitting member of the House of Lords, taking the Conservative whip, and in 2020 became an adviser to the Board of Trade. He is the founding president of the Initiative for Free Trade.

Hannan was the first secretary-general of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE), serving from 2009 to 2018. He was one of the founders of Vote Leave, one of the organisations that campaigned to leave the EU in 2016, and served on its board throughout the referendum. He played a prominent role in the referendum campaign, participating in a number of public debates. He ceased to be a member of the European Parliament at the United Kingdom&#x27;s exit from the EU in 2020.

Hannan has written columns for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;International Business Times, ConservativeHome&quot;, and the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot;, as well as occasional columns in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He is editor-in-chief of &quot;The Conservative&quot;, a quarterly journal of centre-right political thought. He has published several books.

==Early life==
Hannan was born on 1 September 1971 in Lima, Peru. His mother was a Scot who had been working in the British Embassy in Lima. His father, whose family origins are Ulster Catholic, had been educated in the UK and had served in Italy during the Second World War with the North Irish Horse of the British Army. Hannan grew up on his parents&#x27; farm outside Lima, attending school and university in Britain. He was educated at Winchester House School and Marlborough College.

Hannan read modern history at Oriel College, Oxford. He was active in university politics, being elected President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1992, when Nicky Morgan was his opponent. As an undergraduate, he established the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain in 1990, a group which campaigned against closer EU integration – a theme that was to shape his later career.

On 12 September 1992, he organised a protest at the EU finance ministers&#x27; summit in Bath against membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Three days later, the pound was forced to leave the system in an event known as Black Wednesday. In an article published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hannan claimed that this event was connected with his protest activities.

==Early political career==
After graduating in 1993, Hannan became the first director of the European Research Group, an organisation for Eurosceptic Conservative MPs chaired by Michael Spicer. From 1994 to 1995, he served as Chairman of the National Association of Conservative Graduates.
In 1996, he became a leader-writer at &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; under Charles Moore. He wrote leaders for the paper until 2004, and has written blogs and columns ever since. Hannan has since contributed to &quot;The Spectator&quot; and many other newspapers and magazines around the world. In 1997, he became an adviser and speechwriter to Michael Howard, then Shadow Foreign Secretary.

In 2001, during the general election campaign, while already serving as an MEP, he wrote speeches for William Hague, the Conservative leader. In 1999 he stood down from his posts at the European Research Group and Conservative Graduates.

==Member of the European Parliament==
Hannan was elected to the European Parliament in 1999. His first act on being elected was to write an article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; about the expenses and allowances available to MEPs, which caused great controversy.

In 2000, he launched a public appeal to support the underfunded &quot;No&quot; campaign in Denmark&#x27;s referendum on joining the euro. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper accused him of running the appeal from his parliamentary office, but withdrew the accusation when it was shown that he had, in fact, operated out of his own flat. Denmark ultimately voted against joining the euro.

Hannan was re-elected at the top of his party&#x27;s list for the South East England constituency in 2004. He was re-elected again, in 2009 and 2014, each time at the head of the Conservative list, a ranking determined by party members in a postal ballot.

In December 2018, Hannan ranked 738 out of 751 MEPs for his participation in roll call votes in the European Parliament.

===Campaign against the Lisbon Treaty===
One of Hannan&#x27;s longest-running campaigns as an MEP was for a referendum, first on the European Constitution and then, when that text was revised and renamed, on the Lisbon Treaty. He would end every speech, whatever its subject, with a call, in Latin, for the Lisbon treaty to be put to the vote: &quot;&quot;Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est&quot;. The words were a deliberate echo of Cato the Elder, the Roman Senator who ended every speech with a call for Carthage to be destroyed: &quot;Carthago delenda est&quot;&quot;.

When no referendum was forthcoming, Hannan began to use parliamentary procedure to draw attention to his campaign. Under the rules as they then stood, all MEPs were allowed to speak for up to 60 seconds following the vote on each matter on which they had voted, a procedure known as &quot;Explanations of Vote&quot;. In 2008, he organised a multi-national rota of Eurosceptic MEPs to speak on every permissible vote, always ending their speeches by calling for a referendum on Lisbon.

The campaign served to delay proceedings, and the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, declared that he should have a discretionary right to disallow any such interventions when he was &quot;convinced that these are manifestly intended to cause, and will result in, a prolonged and serious obstruction of the procedures of the House or the rights of other Members&quot; (Rule 20, para 1).

Following this intervention when Hannan continued speaking after his allocated time, he was interrupted and had his microphone cut off by Luigi Cocilovo, one of the 14 Vice-Presidents.

Hannan reacted by likening the European Parliament to 1930s Germany:

In response to this the EPP leader, Joseph Daul, initiated proceedings to expel Hannan from the group. At the relevant meeting, Hannan told members that the ideological differences between him and the majority of EPP members on the question of European integration made his expulsion their only logical choice. He duly left the group on 20 February 2008, and sat as a non-attached (non-inscrit) member until the rest of the British Conservatives followed to form the European Conservatives and Reformists following the 2009 election.

Hannan, who had campaigned against EPP membership since before his election, rejoined his colleagues in the new ECR Group in 2009, and became the first Secretary-General of its attached Euro-party, AECR, subsequently ACRE.

While he was Secretary-General, ACRE attracted criticism over spending of EU funds to promote events of limited relevance or benefit to the EU. On 10 December 2018, European parliament senior leaders ordered ACRE to repay €535,609 (£484,367) of EU funds adjudged to have been spent on inappropriate events, including €250,000 spent on a three-day event at a luxury beach resort in Miami and €90,000 spent on a trade &quot;summit&quot; at a five-star hotel on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kampala. Parliament authorities suggest that Hannan used EU funds for ACRE to support other pet projects, such as his free-trade thinktank, the Initiative for Free Trade (IFT), as well as Conservatives International.

===&quot;The devalued Prime Minister&quot; speech===
On 24 March 2009, after Gordon Brown had given a short speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in advance of the G20 London summit, Hannan followed up by delivering a 3-minute speech strongly criticising the response by Gordon Brown to the global financial crisis. He finished the speech with the phrase, &quot;the devalued Prime Minister of a devalued government&quot;, which was a quote taken from a 1992 speech by then-Labour Party leader John Smith about Prime Minister John Major. A video clip of the speech went viral on YouTube that evening, eventually viewed over 3 million times, and two years later remained the most-watched YouTube video of any UK politician.

The video of the speech brought Hannan to prominence in both the UK and elsewhere around the world, notably the United States. In the following months, Hannan appeared both via satellite and in person on various Fox News shows, including those of Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and Neil Cavuto. Given that the United States was then in the middle of a debate about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Hannan was often asked about the benefits of the British National Health Service. Hannan generally criticized the NHS, saying it &quot;puts the power of life and death in the hands of a state bureaucracy&quot;.

Hannan later said that he was &quot;slightly perplexed&quot; at the popularity of the speech, given that he had made similar speeches before. However, he was pleased with the outcome, saying that it showed that, with the rise of the internet, &quot;political reporters no longer get to decide what&#x27;s news&quot;, which he felt was &quot;good news for libertarians of every stripe.&quot;

===Campaign to leave the EU===
Hannan, being one of the founders of the Vote Leave campaign, was at the forefront of the 2016 Referendum on membership of the European Union. Described in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the man who brought you Brexit&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; described his Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain as the start of the Brexit movement.

Along with Douglas Carswell, Hannan is credited with being &quot;part of the hard core who kept the flame of Tory Euroscepticism burning – and tirelessly promoted their own positive, internationalist case for Britain&#x27;s exit from the EU in parallel to Farage&#x27;s negative, isolationist one.&quot; As he was about to graduate in 1992, Hannan wrote to Tory rebels who were against the Maastricht Treaty in 1992; together they created the European Research Group, with Hannan as their secretary.

Hannan said that the name was intentionally innocuous, since the group worked unabashedly against the single currency and the ECJ. He was involved in the creation of the Congress for Democracy, an umbrella organisation for various Eurosceptic groups, which reportedly contained both trade union shop stewards and activists of the UKIP party.
On Twitter, Hannan claimed that &quot;it&#x27;s irresponsible to scare EU nationals in the UK by hinting their status might change after Brexit. No one&#x27;s suggesting such a thing&quot;. This was despite the government&#x27;s wish to make EU nationals apply for &quot;settled status&quot; to remain in the UK.

In an interview in 2015 Hannan asserted that &quot;absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market.&quot; Seven years later, he began a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; column with &quot;Staying in the single market, or large parts of it, would have saved us a lot of trouble&quot;, noting that that statement had long been treated as a &quot;pledge&quot; and used to discredit him. Critics of Brexit treated that as a major concession on his part, given his lengthy advocacy for the UK to leave the EU long before 2016.

Hannan clarified that what he had always advocated was that after leaving the EU, the UK should rejoin the European Free Trade Association, of which it had been a founding member, and thus retain what benefits of the single market it felt it should. Given the narrow success of the referendum, he emphasized that it was important that an agreement on the terms of Britain&#x27;s departure have broad support from both sides, and he believed that would have been a start. Had Cameron&#x27;s successor been an enthusiastic Leave supporter, Hannan believed, that would have come to pass and the UK would have left the EU earlier than it ultimately did. May&#x27;s support for retaining freedom of movement above all else hampered that transition, empowered extremists on both sides, and led to Britain&#x27;s failure to take advantage of many opportunities to relax or repeal EU legislation it had retained, leaving the UK in some ways more restrictive than some EU countries.

Hannan in 2016 wrote an article imagining what Britain would look like on 24 June 2025, with all the advantages of having left the EU and being freed from its rules, saying that the UK had become the world leader in biotech, law, education, the audio-visual sector, financial services and software, with new industries springing up and older industries becoming competitive again. The EU had meanwhile stagnated.

Some of those who responded were not convinced, primarily noting that if that was what Hannan felt, he should have said so &quot;with any kind of force between 2016 and 2019, when it might have changed or meant anything&quot;, as Zoe Williams argued in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Jonn Elledge in &quot;New Statesman&quot; concurred that Hannan was only willing to say this so bluntly when doing so carried no political risk to himself or his side. &quot;Much easier instead to blame the lack of compromise on Remainers and the left, two groups who famously had a huge degree of influence over Theresa May&#x27;s thinking.&quot;

==&quot;The Conservative&quot;==
In September 2016, Hannan launched &quot;The Conservative&quot;, a periodical publication in print volume and in an online version published quarterly. In an editorial, he defined its philosophy as follows:
== After the European Parliament ==
In September 2020, Hannan was named an advisor to the British Board of Trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/board-of-trade#advisers-to-the-board-september-2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That December it was announced he would be made a life peer after a nomination by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. In the morning of Monday 25 January 2021 he was created &quot;Baron Hannan of Kingsclere, of Kingsclere in the County of Hampshire&quot;.

==Political positions==
===Localism===
Hannan is an advocate of localism. He believes that local government independence is impossible without giving fiscal autonomy. To that end, he supports replacing Value Added Tax with a local sales tax, set by local councils.

He was co-author, along with 27 Conservative MPs elected in 2005, of &quot;Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party&quot;, which proposes the wholesale devolution of power and the direct election of decision-makers, and the replacement of the NHS with a private insurance system These ideas were developed further in a series of six pamphlets, &quot;The Localist Papers&quot;, serialised in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2007.

===Nationalism===
Hannan is an advocate of national sovereignty and has questioned the idea that &quot;nationalism causes war&quot;. Hannan has been referred to as a &quot;British nationalist&quot; and &quot;British Gaullist&quot;. In a debate prior to the EU Referendum in Great Britain, Hannan said &quot;Being a nation means that we are not just a random set of individuals born to a different random set of random individuals. It imposes on us a duty to keep intact the freedoms that we were lucky enough to inherit from our parents and pass them on securely to the next generation.&quot; He advocates an affinity of &quot;English-speaking nations&quot; which share &quot;Anglosphere characteristics&quot;.

After British Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn suggested that the Elgin Marbles be returned to Athens, Hannan criticised Corbyn for &quot;national &quot;, writing in ConservativeHome that this confirms the view that Corbyn will &quot;always and everywhere back another country against his own&quot;. Hannan similarly criticised former Downing Street press secretary Alastair Campbell for &quot;cheering for the other side&quot; after Campbell retweeted positions of Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on social media while Campbell, writing in The New European, suggested that Hannan was &quot;claiming a monopoly on patriotism.&quot;

Journalist Philip Collins, in Prospect Magazine, writes &quot;Hannan has the constant tra-la-la effusiveness of a man forever on his way home from choral evensong at an
Oxford college. There is a sense from all of them of living out a caricature. None of them thinks they have signed up for the narrow version of nationalism written in blood.&quot;

===Electoral reform===

Hannan argues in his writings and in the media (for example, during an appearance on &quot;Question Time&quot; on BBC television on 28 May 2009) for ballot initiatives (whereby electors can directly enact legislation as happens in Switzerland), a power of recall (whereby a sitting Member of Parliament can be forced to submit to re-election if enough of the local electorate support this), fixed term parliaments, local and national referendums, open primaries and the abolition of party lists. He is also an advocate of Single Transferable Vote as a replacement for the UK&#x27;s First Past The Post system of voting.

===Economic policy===
Hannan wrote in March 2011, criticizing anti-austerity protesters, stating they &quot;have decided to indulge their penchant for empty, futile, self-righteous indignation&quot;. He remarked, &quot;After &#x27;No Cuts!&#x27; the marchers&#x27; favourite slogan was &#x27;Fairness!&#x27; All right, then...How about being fair to our children, whom we have freighted with a debt unprecedented in peacetime?&quot;

A supporter of the &#x27;leave&#x27; campaign in the 2016 Brexit vote, Hannan writes regularly about the United Kingdom&#x27;s future international trade relationship once it leaves the EU. In September 2017, he became the founding president of the Institute for Free Trade (IFT), a free-market think tank based in London. Following the creation of the UK Government&#x27;s Department for International Trade (DIT) to prepare for international trading arrangements after Brexit, the IFT states its aims as filling the gap in UK-based research and expertise on trade issues. Chuka Umunna has described the organisation as &quot;fanatical hard Brexit-supporting ideologues&quot;.

The IFT briefly changed its name to &quot;Initiative for Free Trade&quot; after it emerged that permission to use the title &quot;Institute&quot;, which is protected by law, had not been granted by Companies House and the Business Secretary. However, in Summer 2018, the name was restored. The IFT advisory board includes prominent Brexit advocates such as former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and former Home Secretary Michael Howard.

Hannan has suggested that the UK adopt a globally free-trading policy after Brexit, and has suggested that the UK should join the trans-pacific partnership. Trade experts have routinely criticised such a position for ignoring the impracticality of creating as close trading relationships as those the UK already has as a member of the single market.

Hannan is on the International Board of Students for Liberty, a non-profit group operating globally to encourage classical liberalism and liberal economics.

===Foreign policy===
Hannan has a &#x27;deep admiration&#x27; of the United States, and describes himself as an Atlanticist with positive views of the United States as well as other nations of the Anglosphere. Hannan claims to be supportive of free trade, arguing that the European Union blocks trade with countries such as China, India and Ethiopia.

He opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq undertaken during the premiership of Tony Blair. He opposed British intervention in Libya.

Hannan has proposed that British foreign policy pivot away from the European Union towards the United States and the Commonwealth.

He endorsed then-Democratic candidate Barack Obama for President on 18 October 2008 against John McCain. He stated that a McCain presidency would mean an &quot;imperial overstretch&quot;, particularly arguing that the U.S. should have been preparing to leave Iraq immediately.

Hannan regretted his endorsement, which he called in his blog his &quot;single most unpopular post&quot; in his blogging career, and backed Mitt Romney in 2012. He argued, &quot;Any American reader who wants to know where Obamification will lead should spend a week with me in the European Parliament. I&#x27;m working in your future and, believe me, you won&#x27;t like it.&quot;

In the 2016 United States presidential election, Hannan argued that both main parties had put forward unfit candidates, and urged Americans to vote for the Libertarian, Gary Johnson.

===Social policy===
Hannan is opposed to what he considers to be &quot;victimless crimes&quot;, and he favours drug decriminalisation: &quot;I&#x27;d start with cannabis, and if that worked I wouldn&#x27;t in principle be against decriminalising heroin.&quot;

===Health care===
Hannan has frequently been critical of England&#x27;s National Health Service. He has claimed the NHS has left Britain with low survival rates for cancers and strokes, a high risk of becoming more ill in hospital, and with constant waiting lists. He remarked on American television at a time when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was being debated that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t wish it [the NHS] on anyone&quot;. David Cameron, who had said that his priorities were &quot;three letters: NHS&quot;, distanced himself from Hannan&#x27;s remarks as &quot;some rather eccentric points of view&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Hannan said of the media storm provoked by his comments:

he also said:we seem to have lost the notion that a backbencher speaks for himself. I like David Cameron, and want him to be Prime Minister, not least so that Britain stops racking up debt. But the idea that I therefore agree with him on every issue is, when you think about it, silly.

In 2015, writing for &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot;, Hannan claimed the popular support for the NHS in the UK was a consequence of the wider public being &quot;passively conscripted&quot; by a &quot;knot of hardline leftists&quot; like those who had harassed his mother after he criticised the NHS. He told his readers &quot;This is your last chance to strangle Obamacare at birth; flunk it, and you won&#x27;t get another.&quot;

===Enoch Powell===
Hannan provoked criticism in August 2009 when it emerged that he had praised the Conservative politician Enoch Powell as &quot;somebody who understood the importance of national democracy, who understood why you need to live in an independent country and what that meant, as well as being a free marketeer and a small-government Conservative.&quot;

Hannan nonetheless disagrees with Powell&#x27;s most famous policy view, his anti-immigration stance, stating, &quot;For what it&#x27;s worth, I think Enoch Powell was wrong on immigration... Being an immigrant myself, I have particular cause to be grateful for Britain&#x27;s understated cosmopolitanism.&quot;

Writing on &quot;The Telegraph&quot; website, Hannan said: &quot;I&#x27;m surprised that no one has picked up on the thing that I most admire about Enoch Powell, namely his tendency to ignore conventional wisdom and think things through from first principles. Like Rowan Williams, he always did his hearers the courtesy of addressing them as intelligent adults. Both men regularly got into trouble in consequence, either because they were genuinely misunderstood or because their detractors affected to misunderstand them. Neither responded by dumbing down. That, in politics, takes a special kind of integrity.&quot;

===Chequers proposal===
The government&#x27;s policy on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union that the Cabinet had discussed at Chequers was published as a White Paper on 12 July 2018 for debate in the House of Commons the following week. In July 2018, Hannan wrote in his &quot;Telegraph&quot; column regarding the Government&#x27;s Chequers Proposal. Distinct from the Government&#x27;s position and from that of the ERG, Hannan argued that MPs should vote for the proposal despite its shortcomings, so long as it is not &quot;watered down further&quot;. Summarising, he wrote that &quot;The question is not whether the White Paper is ideal, but whether an imperfect departure is better than either a hostile breakdown or a more subservient relationship&quot;.

He claimed that with Chequers, the UK Government was begging for the kind of deal the EU has with Moldova and Albania, who themselves only sought as a transitional arrangement towards full membership. Writing on the contents of the White Paper, Hannan claimed that &quot;There is a good reason to accept EU standards on goods rather than services: half our goods exports go to the EU, but only 37 per cent of our services.&quot; He also stated that since most goods standards are set at a global level, the concession to maintain EU standards on goods makes sense.

===UKIP===
In spring 2012, Hannan suggested in a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article that an accommodation be made between the Conservative Party and the UK Independence Party (UKIP), and would be preferable to one with the Liberal Democrats.

===Good Friday Agreement===
Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hannan has argued that while the Good Friday Agreement was &quot;often spoken about in quasi-religious terms … its flaws have become clearer over time.&quot; Hannan&#x27;s account of the Good Friday Agreement has been criticised as factually inaccurate and reckless.

===Disputed statement about Fianna Fáil===
In a January 2019 article for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hannan wrote that Irish political party Fianna Fáil &quot;won every Irish election&quot; between 1932 and 2008. Fianna Fáil did receive the highest proportion of the vote out of any party at every election during those years. However, it came first in elections in said period, but failed to form the government in six of those elections.

Hannan&#x27;s statement led to online mockery in March 2019; on Twitter, some of those making fun of Hannan&#x27;s statement used the hashtag &quot;#HannanIrishHistory&quot; to post incorrect facts about Irish history. Hannan, who is himself part Ulster Catholic responded to the mockery by writing on Twitter, &quot;I managed a Double First in Modern History from Oxford. One of the things I was taught is that historians necessarily have different takes on the same events. Please try to accept that yours is not the only interpretation.&quot;

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Hannan argued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that the COVID-19 virus was not as serious to the general population as was widely believed. He was very critical of the UK government&#x27;s response to the pandemic, arguing against restrictions on public mobility. Hannan joined other high-profile critics, known as &#x27;lockdown sceptics&#x27;, such as Lord Sumption and Toby Young, in arguing that the full restrictive lockdown would have serious negative consequences, as a result of restrictions on civil liberties, locking down the population, and stalling the economy. He first expressed this view in February 2020 in an article he wrote in the website ConservativeHome, and stuck to it consistently through the lockdown.

== Personal life ==
Hannan speaks English, French and Spanish.

Hannan is a supporter of bullfighting, and has written several articles in the Telegraph and elsewhere promoting the activity. In 2004, he wrote for the Telegraph that he had attended a training course with a California-based bullfighting school in which he participated in a tienta, which aims to ascertain if cows can be used to breed fighting bulls for the ring. Additionally, he has written for the specialist English-language bullfighting publication La Divisa, published by Club Taurino of London, a UK-based association for &#x27;aficionados.&#x27; In April 2022, the Evening Standard reported that he had written articles about this topic for The Critic magazine under the pseudonym of Christopher North.

==Awards and distinctions==
In 2009, Hannan was awarded the Bastiat Prize for Online Journalism for his &quot;Telegraph&quot; blog.

He won the award for Speech of the Year at the 2009 Spectator Awards, for his Gordon Brown speech in the European Parliament.

He won the 2012 Columbia Award (Washington Policy Centre) and the 2014 Paolucci Book Award (Intercollegiate Studies Institute). Hannan was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize in blogging in 2011.

In 2014, Hannan won the Political Books Awards polemic of the year award, for his book &quot;How We Invented Freedom and Why It Matters&quot;.

In 2017, Hannan received the Whittaker Chambers Award from the National Review Institute in person from John O&#x27;Sullivan. The award was opposed by the family of Whittaker Chambers; David Chambers, Whittaker&#x27;s grandson, wrote that Whittaker would have supported a strong European Union as a counterweight to &quot;Russia&#x27;s new Stalin, Vladimir Putin.&quot;

<doc id="723984" wikidata="Q953376" url="?curid=723984" title="Giles Chichester">
<text>Giles Bryan Chichester (born 29 July 1946) is a British Conservative Party politician who was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South West England and Gibraltar from 1999 until he retired 2014. He was elected as Vice-President of the European Parliament on 6 July 2011 to replace Silvana Koch-Mehrin who had resigned over plagiarism allegations.

Chichester was born in London and educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. Since 1969, he has worked in the family business, Francis Chichester Ltd (publishers of maps, guides and educational wallcharts), founded by his father Sir Francis Chichester KBE, and still lives in the family home at 9 St James&#x27;s Place, London SW1.

He was MEP for Devon and East Plymouth from 1994 to 1999 and represented South West England in the European Parliament from 1999 until 2014. On 23 July 2004 he was elected chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

He is a former chairman of the Carlton Club Political Committee and is chairman of his family business publishing maps.

Chichester describes himself as a &quot;climate change sceptic&quot;.

==Expenses==
On 5 June 2008, Chichester voluntarily stepped down as Leader of the Conservative MEPs in order to clear his name after it was alleged that since 1996 he had wrongly sent European parliamentary funds for secretarial and office services through his family business of which he was a paid director: he was succeeded by his deputy, Philip Bushill-Matthews. Chichester insisted it was his understanding that the contract had been accepted by the EU Parliament in 1999 and in 2004, and that he transferred money for his political staff through the company simply as an easier means of administration. The European Parliament suggested that a change in the Financial Regulation in 2003 meant this arrangement could constitute a potential conflict of interest.

The situation arose while as Leader of the Conservative MEPs Cameron had tasked Chichester to review and compile a code of conduct for Conservative MEPs&#x27; expenses after the embarrassment of MP Derek Conway. However, Chichester admitted that once he had been told the contract was not in order he cancelled it immediately and described it as a &quot;whoopsy-daisy&quot; surprise to him.

Chichester stood again successfully for re-election as an MEP in 2009.

<doc id="723989" wikidata="Q333714" url="?curid=723989" title="Neil Parish">
<text>Neil Quentin Gordon Parish (born 26 May 1956) is a British farmer and former politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tiverton and Honiton from 2010 until his resignation in 2022. A member of the Conservative Party, he was previously a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South West England from 1999 to 2009. Parish chaired the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee from 2015 until his resignation from the House of Commons.

In April 2022, Parish had the Conservative party whip suspended pending an investigation into allegations that he had watched pornography in the Commons chamber during a debate. After admitting to the allegations, he resigned as an MP. His departure triggered a by-election held on 23 June, which was won by the Liberal Democrat candidate, Richard Foord.

==Early life and career==
Neil Quentin Gordon Parish was born in Bridgwater, Somerset, on 26 May 1956. Parish attended Brymore School, a local authority-run agricultural boarding school at Cannington near Bridgwater. In 1972, he left school at 16 to manage the family farm.

Parish began his career in politics in local government, serving from 1983 to 1995 as Councillor, Sedgemoor District Council; 1989–95 as Deputy leader, Sedgemoor District Council; 1989–93 as Councillor, Somerset County Council. In the 1997 general election, he contested Torfaen, a safe Labour seat in South Wales. Incumbent MP Paul Murphy defeated him by 24,536 votes.

==European Parliament==
Parish was elected to the European Parliament for the South West England region in the 1999 election. He was re-elected in 2004 on the top of the Conservatives&#x27; party list.

Parish acted as an election monitor during the 2000 Zimbabwean parliamentary election and criticised the conduct of Robert Mugabe&#x27;s government. During the 2008 Presidential election, Neil Parish called on the British Government to reject the legitimacy of ZANU-PF and to recognise Morgan Tsvangirai&#x27;s Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai party as the democratically elected Government of Zimbabwe. Parish was banned from re-entering Zimbabwe after voicing his criticism.

For his entire career in the European Parliament, he was a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. From January 2007 to July 2009 he was chairman of that committee. In December 2001, he was appointed Conservative spokesman on agriculture and he was also the delegation&#x27;s deputy chief whip. He was instrumental in setting up the year-long European Parliament&#x27;s public inquiry into the 2007 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, and he was also a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s inquiry into the collapse of Equitable Life. He also served as a substitute member of the Committee on Fisheries.

During his time as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, it was reported that David Miliband, at the time the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, had described Neil Parish as a &quot;Rottweiler&quot; for his dogged persistence.

In early 2007, Parish was selected as the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Tiverton and Honiton. The seat&#x27;s Conservative MP, Angela Browning, had announced in November 2006 she would not stand again. Parish did not stand for re-election in the 2009 European Parliament election.

==Member of Parliament==
Parish was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tiverton and Honiton on 6 May 2010. The Conservative vote increased by 3.6 per cent, with Parish attracting 27,614 votes – 50.3 per cent of the overall votes cast. He had a majority of 9,320 votes.

In June 2010, Parish was elected to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee. The committee is elected by the House of Commons to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and its associated public bodies including the Environment Agency and Natural England.

Parish was elected by Conservative backbenchers as chairman of the 1922 Committee environment policy committee in July 2010. The committee plays a role in policy formation and as a channel of communication between backbenchers and ministers. From 2010 to 2015, Parish was chairman of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare. Parish was one of 79 Conservative MPs who, on 24 October 2011, rebelled against a three-line whip by voting for a referendum on the UK&#x27;s relationship with the European Union.

In July 2012, Parish relaunched and was elected the chairman of both the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Beef and Lamb and the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Pig and Poultry, which ensure that parliamentarians are briefed by industry experts on the latest developments in the industry, including supply chains, exports, sustainability, health and nutrition.

On 22 July 2014, Parish was appointed the parliamentary private secretary to John Hayes, Minister of State for Transport, who also acted as a senior advisor to the Prime Minister.

Parish opposes, and voted against the implementation of same-sex marriage, stating that he felt the issue was &quot;for the Church and Christians to decide [upon], not for parliament to legislate.&quot; In 2014, Parish voted against enabling the courts to deal with proceedings for the divorce of a same-sex couple and against making same-sex marriage available to armed forces personnel outside the UK.

After the 2015 general election, he was returned unopposed as the chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee. Parish was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum. In 2016 also, he received the annual Dairy UK Award together with Heather Wheeler MP for their support of dairy farmers and the industry. While an MP, Parish continued to live on his family farm in Somerset and declared a financial interest in it.

===Pornography investigation=== 
On 25 April 2022, a group of female Conservative MPs met with the Government Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris to complain about sexism in parliament. In the course of the discussion one female MP spoke out alleging that an unnamed male colleague had been watching pornography next to her in the House of Commons. Initial media reporting likewise did not name the MP. Before he had been publicly identified as the accused MP, Parish was interviewed on GB News and said that the MP should be &quot;dealt with and dealt with seriously&quot;.

On 29 April Parish had the Conservative whip withdrawn after being accused of watching pornography on a personal mobile phone in the Commons chamber. Parish referred himself to the Commons Select Committee on Standards following the removal of the whip. The allegation was made by a female Conservative minister, and later corroborated by another unnamed MP. 

Initially, Parish said that he might have viewed the pornography by mistake. He subsequently told the BBC that he had watched pornography in the Palace of Westminster on two occasions, first accidentally and then deliberately. He said that he had been initially looking at a website about tractors; allies of Parish suggested he may have been looking at Claas Dominator tractors, a brand of combine harvesters. According to Parish, he then reached &quot;another website with a very similar name&quot; and &quot;watched for a bit&quot;. He said: &quot;My crime – biggest crime – is that on another occasion I went in a second time ... that was [while] sitting waiting to vote.&quot; 

On 30 April 2022, Parish announced his intention to resign as an MP,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc30/4/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which triggered the 2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election. Angela Rayner, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, tweeted: &quot;He was looking for tractors but ended up with porn actors? Neil Parish must think you were all born yesterday.&quot; On 4 May, he was appointed Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, disqualifying him as an MP and vacating his seat. At the by-election, on 23 June, the Liberal Democrats won the seat for the first time in the area since 1923.

In an interview with LBC in June 2022, Parish said that he had experienced suicidal thoughts after the incident and that the police had &quot;very kindly and rightly&quot; confiscated his guns to prevent him from killing himself. He also said that he had experienced death threats over the incident. Parish additionally commented that he &quot;was wrong to be watching [pornography]&quot; and that what he did was &quot;very immoral&quot; but not illegal. Asked if he had been &quot;done in&quot; by some of his colleagues, he replied: &quot;I think probably I was.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1981 Parish married Susan Gail, whom he employed as a junior secretary while serving as an MP, later, a teacher. The couple have a son and a daughter, and two grandchildren.

<text>The redback spider (&quot;Latrodectus hasselti&quot;), also known as the Australian black widow, is a species of highly venomous spider believed to originate in Australia but now, Southeast Asia and New Zealand, it has also been found in packing crates in the United States with colonies elsewhere outside Australia. It is a member of the cosmopolitan genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot;, the widow spiders. The adult female is easily recognised by her spherical black body with a prominent red stripe on the upper side of her abdomen and an hourglass-shaped red/orange streak on the underside. Females usually have a body length of about , while the male is much smaller, being only long.

Mainly nocturnal, the female redback lives in an untidy web in a warm sheltered location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often, it first squirts its victim with what resembles &#x27;superglue&#x27; from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim&#x27;s limbs and appendages to its own body. The redback spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the redback spider&#x27;s retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live on the periphery of the female spiders&#x27; web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of a number of arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.

After mating, sperm is stored in the spermathecae, organs of the female reproductive tract, and can be used up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, Japan and greenhouses in Belgium.

The redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans, and its liking for habitats in built structures has led it to being responsible for a large number of serious spider bites in Australia. Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates, the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans; this starts with pain around the bite site, which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours. Sweating in localised patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism. Generalised symptoms of nausea, vomiting, headache, and agitation may also occur and indicate severe envenomation. An antivenom has been available since 1956.

==Taxonomy and naming==

===Common names===
The common name &quot;redback&quot; is derived from the distinctive red stripe along the dorsal aspect of its abdomen. Other common names include red-striped spider, red-spot spider, jockey spider, Murra-ngura spider, Kapara spider and the Kanna-jeri spider.

===History===
Before DNA analysis, the taxonomy of the widow spider genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot; had been unclear—changes in the number of species reflect the difficulty of using morphology to determine subdivisions within the genus. Substantial interest in their systematics was most likely prompted by the medical importance of these venomous spiders. Swedish arachnologist Tamerlan Thorell described the redback spider in 1870 from specimens collected in Rockhampton and Bowen in central Queensland. He named it &quot;Latrodectus hasseltii&quot; in honour of colleague A.W.M. van Hasselt. In the same paper, he named a female from Cape York with an all-black abdomen &quot;L. scelio&quot;, now regarded as the same species. These specimens are in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm.

German arachnologist Friedrich Dahl revised the genus in 1902 and named &quot;L. ancorifer&quot; from New Guinea, which was later regarded as a subspecies of the redback. Another subspecies, &quot;L. h. aruensis&quot;, was described by Norwegian entomologist Embrik Strand in 1911. Subspecies &quot;indica&quot; (of &quot;L. scelio&quot;) had been described by Eugène Simon in 1897, but its origin is unclear. Frederick Octavius Pickard-Cambridge questioned Dahl&#x27;s separating species on what he considered minor anatomical details but Dahl dismissed Pickard-Cambridge as an &quot;ignoramus&quot;. Pickard-Cambridge was unsure whether &quot;L. hasselti&quot; warranted species status, though he confirmed &quot;scelio&quot; and &quot;hasselti&quot; as a single species, other researchers such as Ludwig Carl Christian Koch noting the differences to be inconsistent. The redback was also considered by some to be conspecific with the katipō (&quot;L. katipo&quot;), which is native to New Zealand, though Koch regarded them as distinct.

Reviewing the genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot; in 1959, arachnologist Herbert Walter Levi concluded that the colour variations were largely continuous across the world and were not suitable for distinguishing the individual species. Instead, he focused on differences in the morphology of the female sexual organs, and revised the number of recognised species from 22 to 6. This included reclassifying the redback and several other species as subspecies of the best-known member of the group, the black widow spider (&quot;Latrodectus mactans&quot;), found in North America and other regions. He did not consider the subspecies &quot;L. h. ancorifer&quot;, &quot;L. h. aruensis&quot; and &quot;L. h. indicus&quot; distinct enough to warrant recognition. Subsequently, more reliable genetic studies have split the genus into about 30 species, and the redback has no recognised subspecies in modern classifications.

===Placement===
A member of the genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot; in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipō as its closest relative. A 2004 molecular study supports the redback&#x27;s status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close relationship between the two species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipō producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipō is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipō and male redbacks in the wild.

==Description==
The adult female redback has a body around long, with slender legs, the first pair of which are longer than the rest. The round abdomen is a deep black (occasionally brownish), with a red (sometimes orange) longitudinal stripe on the upper surface and an hourglass-shaped scarlet streak on the underside. Females with incomplete markings or all-black abdomens occasionally occur. The cephalothorax is much smaller than the abdomen, and is black. Redback spiderlings are grey with dark spots, and become darker with each moult. Juvenile females have additional white markings on the abdomen. The bright scarlet red colours may serve as a warning to potential predators. Each spider has a pair of venom glands, one attached to each of its chelicerae with very small fangs. Small compared to the female, the male redback is long and is light brown, with white markings on the upper side of the abdomen and a pale hourglass marking on the underside.

Another species in Australia with a similar physique, &quot;Steatoda capensis&quot;, has been termed the &quot;false redback spider&quot;, but it is uniformly black (or plum), and does not display the red stripe.

==Behaviour==

===Web===
The redback is mainly nocturnal; the female remains concealed during the day, and spins her web during the night, usually remaining in the same location for most of her adult life. Classified as a gum-footed tangle web, the web is an irregular-looking tangle of fine but strong silk. Although the threads seem random, they are strategically placed for support and entrapment of prey. The rear portion of the web forms a funnel-like retreat area where the spider and egg sacs are found. This area has vertical, sticky catching threads that run to ground attachments. The vertical strands act as trip wires to initially alert the spider to the presence of prey or threats. They also snare and haul prey into the air when weaker horizontal strands that hold them down, known as guy lines, break when prey thrash around. These webs are usually placed between two flat surfaces, one beneath the other. The female spends more time in the funnel and less time moving around during cooler weather.
The individual web filaments are quite strong, able to entangle and hold small reptiles.

===Prey===
Redbacks usually prey on insects, but can capture larger animals that become entangled in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (&quot;Porcellio scaber&quot;) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies show that they are willing to consume common fruit flies (&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;), mealworm larvae (&quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot;), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg&#x27;s length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim&#x27;s innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.

Commonly, prey-stealing occurs where larger females take food items stored in other spiders&#x27; webs. When they encounter other spiders of the same species, often including those of the opposite sex, they engage in battle, and the defeated spider is eaten. If a male redback is accepted by a female, it is permitted to feed on the victims snared in the female&#x27;s web. Baby spiders also steal food from their mother, which she tries to prevent. They also consume sticky silk as well as small midges and flies. Spiderlings are cannibalistic, more active ones sometimes eating their less active siblings.

===Life cycle===

Spiderlings hatch from their eggs after about 8 days and can emerge from the egg sac as early as 11 days after being laid, although cooler temperatures can significantly slow their development so that emergence does not occur for months. After hatching they spend about a week inside the egg sac, feeding on the yolk and molting once. Baby spiders appear from September to January (spring to early summer). Male spiders mature through five instars in about 45–90 days. Females mature through seven–eight instars in about 75–120 days. Males live for up to six or seven months, while females may live between two and three years. Laboratory tests have shown that redbacks may survive for an average of 100 days, and sometimes over 300 days without any food, those starved at faring better than those kept without food at . Spiders are known to reduce their metabolic rates in response to starvation, and can distend their abdomens to store large amounts of food. Redbacks can survive temperatures from below freezing point to , though they do need relatively warm summers, with temperatures of for two to three months, to survive and breed.

Redback spiderlings cohabit on the maternal web for several days to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by being carried on the wind. They follow light and climb to the top of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens high in the air and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.

===Reproduction===

Before a juvenile male leaves its mother&#x27;s web, it builds a small sperm web on which it deposits its sperm from its gonads and then collects it back into each of its two palps (copulatory organs), because the gonads and palps are not internally connected. After it moults into its last instar, it sets off wandering to seek a female. The male spider does not eat during this period. How males find females is unclear, and it is possible they may balloon like juveniles. A Western Australian field study found that most males took 6 to 8 weeks to travel around with occasional journeys of over , but that only around 11–13% successfully found a mate. They are attracted by pheromones, which are secreted by unmated sexually mature female redback spiders onto their webs and include a serine derivative (&quot;N&quot;-3-methylbutyryl-&quot;O&quot;-(&quot;S&quot;)-2-methylbutyryl--serine). This is thought to be the sole method by which males assess a female&#x27;s reproductive status, and their courtship dismantles much of the pheremone-marked web.

During mating, the male redback attempts to copulate by inserting one of its palps into the one of the female&#x27;s two spermathecae, each of which has its own insemination orifice. It then tries and often succeeds in inserting the other palp into the female&#x27;s second orifice. The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female&#x27;s mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating. Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the species. The first is the eating process allows for a longer period of copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future mating for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males ever find a potential mate during their lifetimes, and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first mating.

Some redback males have been observed using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult within a few days and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.

Once the female has mated, the sperm is stored in one or both of her spermathecae. The sperm can be used to fertilise several batches of eggs, over a period of up to two years (estimated from observations of closely related species), but typically restarts the female&#x27;s pheromone production advertising her sexual availability about three months after mating. A female spider may lay four to ten egg sacs, each of which is around in diameter and contains on average around 250 eggs, though can be as few as 40 or as many as 500. She prepares a shallow concave disc around in diameter before laying eggs into it over a period of around five minutes before laying more silk to complete the sac, which becomes spherical, the whole process taking around one and a quarter hours. She can produce a new egg sac as early as one to three weeks after her last.

==Distribution and habitat==

The redback spider is widespread across Australia. The current distribution reported by the World Spider Catalogue includes Southeast Asia and New Zealand. Colonies and individuals have been found elsewhere, including Japan, England, Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. It was believed at one time that the redback may have been introduced to Australia, because when it was first formally described in 1870, it appeared to be concentrated around sea ports. However, an earlier informal description (1850) from the Adelaide Hills is now known, and names in Australian Aboriginal languages also show that it was present well before European settlement. Its original range is thought to be a relatively small arid part of South Australia and Western Australia. Its spread has been inadvertently aided by modern buildings, which often provide habitats conducive to redback populations. The close relationship between the redback and the New Zealand katipō also supports the native status of both in their respective countries.

Outside urban areas, the redback is more often found in drier habitats ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It became much more common in urban areas in the early decades of the 20th century, and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. It is wide spread throughout urban Australia, with most suburban backyards in the city of Canberra (for instance) having one or more nesting females in such places as firewood piles, stored brick stacks and around unused or restoring motor vehicles as well as generally behind the shed - as observed since at least the 1970s and probably earlier. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, outhouses, empty tins and boxes, children&#x27;s toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface of toilet seats are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in outhouses. The CSIRO Division of Entomology recommends against the use of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.

Spiders in the French territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific were identified as &quot;L. hasselti&quot; in 1920, based on morphology. Their behaviour differs from Australian redbacks, as they do not engage in sexual cannibalism and are less prone to biting humans. The first recorded envenomation in New Caledonia was in 2007.

===Introductions===
The redback spider&#x27;s affinity for human-modified habitat has enabled it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance to cold means that it has the ability to colonise many temperate countries with a winter climate cooler than Australia. This is concerning due to the risks to people being bitten who are unaware of its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.

Redback spiders are also found in small colonies in areas of New Zealand. They are frequently intercepted by quarantine authorities, often among steel or car shipments. They were introduced into New Zealand in the early 1980s, and now are found around Central Otago (including Alexandra, Bannockburn and near Wānaka) in the South Island and New Plymouth in the North Island. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates warn residents and visitors of redback spiders, which have been present since 1990. Colonies have also been established in greenhouses in Belgium, and isolated observations indicate possible presence in New Guinea, the Philippines, and India. Some redbacks were found in Preston, Lancashire, England, after a container of parts arrived from Australia; some may have escaped into the countryside before pest controllers could destroy them. One redback was found in a back garden in Dartford in Kent. Two females were discovered in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas in 2010.

There is an established population of redback spiders in Osaka, Japan, thought to have arrived in cargoes of wood chips.
In 2008, redback spiders were found in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near the container terminal in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within Japan are unclear, but redbacks are thought to have spread by walking or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. Signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.

==Predators and parasitoids==
The black house spider (&quot;Badumna insignis&quot;), the cellar spider (&quot;Pholcus phalangioides&quot;) and the giant daddy-long-legs spider (&quot;Artema atlanta&quot;) are known to prey on the redback spider, and redbacks are often absent if these species are present in significant numbers. &quot;Agenioideus nigricornis&quot;, a spider wasp, is a parasitoid of the adult redback. Other wasps of the families Eurytomidae and Ichneumonidae parasitise redback eggs, and mantid lacewings (Neuroptera and Mantispidae) prey on redback eggs.

==Bites to humans==

===Incidence===
The redback spider has been historically responsible for more envenomations requiring antivenom than any other creature in Australia. However, by 2017 the spider was blamed for only 250 envenomations requiring antivenom annually. Estimates of the number of people thought to be bitten by redback spiders each year across Australia range from 2,000 to 10,000. The larger female spider is responsible for almost all cases of redback spider bites. The smaller male was thought to be unable to envenomate a human, although some cases have been reported; their rarity is probably due to the male&#x27;s smaller size and proportionally smaller fangs, rather than its being incapable of biting or lacking potent venom. The bite from both juvenile and mature females appears to have similar potency. The male bite usually only produces short-lived, mild pain. Most bites occur in the warmer months between December and April, in the afternoon or evening. As the female redback is slow-moving and rarely leaves her web, bites generally occur as a result of placing a hand or other body part too close to the spider, such as when reaching into dark holes or wall cavities. Bites often also occur when a hidden spider is disturbed in items such as clothes, shoes, gloves, building materials, garden tools or children&#x27;s outdoor toys.

A 2004 review reported 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal areas of limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% on the head or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites on the head and neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.

===Venom===
The redback and its relatives in the genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot; are considered dangerous, alongside funnel-web spiders (&quot;Atrax&quot; and &quot;Hadronyche&quot;), mouse spiders (&quot;Missulena&quot;), wandering spiders (&quot;Phoneutria&quot;) and recluse spiders (&quot;Loxosceles&quot;). Venom is produced by holocrine glands in the spider&#x27;s chelicerae (mouth parts). Venom accumulates in the lumen of the glands and passes through paired ducts into the spider&#x27;s two hollow fangs. The venom of the redback spider is thought to be similar to that of the other &quot;Latrodectus&quot; spiders. It contains a complex mixture of cellular constituents, enzymes and a number of high-molecular-weight toxins, including insect toxins and a vertebrate neurotoxin called alpha-latrotoxin, which causes intense pain in humans.

In vertebrates, alpha-latrotoxin produces its effect through destabilisation of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in excessive release of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA. Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms are not well understood. Acetylcholine release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and norepinephrine release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks have an average of around 0.08–0.10 mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the median lethal dose (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91 mg/kg based on the mass of the mice used), but that it is considerably deadlier for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures. Pure alpha-latrotoxin has an LD50 in mice of 20–40 μg/kg.

The specific variant of the vertebrate toxin found in the redback was cloned and sequenced in 2012, and was found to be a sequence of 1180 amino acids, with a strong similarity to the equivalent molecule across the &quot;Latrodectus mactans&quot; clade. The syndromes caused by bites from any spiders of the genus &quot;Latrodectus&quot; have similarities; there is some evidence there is a higher incidence of sweating, and local and radiating pain with the redback, while black widow envenomation results in more back and abdominal pain, and abdominal rigidity is a feature common with bites from the west coast button spider (&quot;Latrodectus indistinctus&quot;) of South Africa.

One crustacean-specific and two insect-specific neurotoxins have been recovered from the Mediterranean black widow (&quot;L. tredecimguttatus&quot;), as have small peptides that inhibit angiotensin-1-converting enzyme; the venom of the redback, although little-studied, likely has similar agents.

===Antivenom===
Redback antivenom was developed by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab&#x27;)2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback antivenom in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5 mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The antivenom has been safely administered to women in various stages of pregnancy. Redback antivenom has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by &quot;Steatoda&quot; spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the antivenom has been reported as effective with bites of &quot;L. katipo&quot;, and &quot;L. tredecimguttatus&quot;. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from &quot;L. mactans&quot;, &quot;L. hesperus&quot;, and &quot;L. tredecimguttatus&quot; (synonym &quot;L. lugubris&quot;).

===Signs and symptoms===

Envenomation from a redback spider bite produces a syndrome known as latrodectism. A small but significant percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. The diagnosis is made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests are rarely needed and there is no specific test for the venom or latrodectism.

The redback&#x27;s small size means that swelling or puncture marks at the bite site are uncommon. The bite may be painful from the start, but more often only feels like a pinprick or mild burning sensation. Within an hour, a more severe local pain may develop with local sweating and sometimes piloerection (goosebumps)—these three symptoms together are a classic presentation of redback spider envenomation. Pain, swelling and redness can spread proximally up a limb or away from the bite site
and regional lymph nodes may become painful. Some subjects with delayed symptoms may present with a characteristic sweating and pain in the lower limbs, generally below the knees, or a burning sensation in the soles of the feet. This may eventuate even if the person was bitten somewhere else on their body.

Around one in three subjects develops systemic symptoms; after a number of hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary oedema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.

Children and infants may be unable to report being bitten, making it difficult to associate their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed and a general erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are often seen in children over four years of age.

Unlike those of some other spiders, redback bites do not necrose. Latrodectism has been misdiagnosed as various medical conditions including acute hepatitis, sepsis, testicular torsion or an acute abdomen.

===Treatment===
Treatment is based on the severity of the envenomation. The majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually require only local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.

Hospital assessment is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics may be necessary to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.

The antivenom manufacturer&#x27;s product information recommends one vial, although more has been used. Past guidelines indicated two vials, with a further two vials recommended if symptoms did not resolve within two hours, however recent guidelines state &quot;antivenom is sometimes given if there is a history, symptoms and signs consistent with systemic envenoming, and severe pain unresponsive to oral analgesics ... however recent trials show antivenom has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. The antivenom can be given by injection intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV). The manufacturer recommends IM use, with IV administration reserved for life-threatening cases. In January 2008 toxicologist Geoffrey Isbister suggested IM antivenom was not as effective as IV antivenom, after proposing that IM antivenom took longer to reach the blood serum. Isbister subsequently found the difference between IV and IM routes of administration was, at best, small and did not justify routinely choosing one route over the other.

These concerns led two handbooks to recommend IV in preference to IM administration in Australian practice. Despite a long history of usage and anecdotal evidence of effectiveness, there is a lack of data from controlled studies confirming the antivenom&#x27;s benefits. In 2014 Isbister and others conducted a randomized controlled trial of intravenous antivenom versus placebo for Redback envenomation, finding the addition of antivenom did not significantly improve pain or systemic effects, while antivenom resulted in acute hypersensitivity reactions in 3.6 per cent of those receiving it. The question of abandoning the antivenom on the basis of this and previous studies came up in the Annals of Emergency Medicine in 2015 where White and Weinstein argued that if the recommendations in the 2014 Isbister et al. paper were followed it would lead to abandonment of antivenom as a treatment option, an outcome White and Weinstein considered undesirable. Authors of the 2014 Isbister et al. paper responded in the same issue by suggesting patients for whom antivenom is considered should be fully informed &quot;there is considerable weight of evidence to suggest it is no better than placebo&quot;, and in light of a risk of anaphylaxis and serum sickness, &quot;routine use of the antivenom is therefore not recommended&quot;.

Before the introduction of antivenom, benzodiazepines and intravenous calcium gluconate were used to relieve symptoms of pain and distress, although calcium is not recommended as its benefit has not been shown in clinical trials.

Studies support the safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of anaphylaxis and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, it is recommended that an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after a bite. However, in the vast majority of cases, it is administered within 24 hours.

===Prognosis===
According to NSW Health, redback spider bites were considered not life-threatening but capable of causing severe pain and systemic symptoms that could continue for hours to days. In almost all cases, symptoms resolve within a week. Fatalities are extremely unlikely. In 2016, the death of a bushwalker from a redback spider bite was widely reported. In this case, the death occurred from secondary infection; and the man in question had just recovered from a serious car accident. Apart from that, there have been no deaths due to redback bite since the introduction of antivenom. Before this, redback spider bites had been implicated in at least 14 deaths in Australia, however these cases cannot be definitively linked to the redback bite as the sole cause.

==Bites to animals==
Redback spider bites are difficult to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats are likely to be more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.

==Historical treatment of bites==
Most traditional or historical first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the &quot;Camperdown Chronicle&quot; reported that a doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, but it was not effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.

==Cultural impact==
Indigenous Australians in New South Wales mixed the spiders&#x27; bodies with the venom of snakes and pine tree gum to form a broth used to coat spear tips. Slim Newton drew popular attention to redbacks with his song &quot;The Redback on the Toilet Seat&quot;, which won the Golden Guitar at the first Country Music Awards of Australia in 1973. Newton recalled an occasion when a friend used his outside toilet where the light globe had blown and reported he was lucky there was not a redback spider on the toilet seat. The phrase inspired him to write the song. A sculpture of an impossibly large redback, one of Australia&#x27;s big things, was built in 1996 at Eight Mile Plains, Queensland. The Angels 1991 album &quot;Red Back Fever&quot; takes its name from the spider. Matilda Bay Brewing Company produces a wheat beer called Redback, with the distinctive red stripe as the logo. The redback appears in the name and emblem of the South Australia cricket team. The Airborne Redback, an Australian ultralight trike, was also named after the spider. Redback Boots is an Australian workboot manufacturing company, which uses the spider in its name and logo. In 2006 a redback spider postage stamp was designed as part of a &quot;Dangerous Australians&quot; stamp series, but was withheld from general circulation by Australia Post due to concerns that the realistic depiction would scare people opening their letter boxes. In 2012 an episode of the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Peppa Pig&quot; in which the title character picks up and plays with a spider was banned from Australian television due to fears that it would encourage children to pick up and play with redback spiders.

<text>NASA&#x27;s series of Great Observatories satellites are four large, powerful space-based astronomical telescopes launched between 1990 and 2003. They were built with different technology to examine specific wavelength/energy regions of the electromagnetic spectrum: gamma rays, X-rays, visible and ultraviolet light, and infrared light.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) primarily observes visible light and near-ultraviolet. It was launched in 1990 aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; during STS-31, but its main mirror had been ground incorrectly, resulting in spherical aberration that compromised the telescope&#x27;s capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by the STS-61 servicing mission in 1993. In 1997, the STS-82 servicing mission added capability in the near-infrared range, and in 2009 the STS-125 servicing mission refurbished the telescope and extended its projected service life. It remains in active operation .

The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) primarily observed gamma rays, though it extended into hard x-rays as well. It was launched in 1991 aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; during STS-37. It was de-orbited in 2000 after a gyroscope failed.

The Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) primarily observes soft X-rays. It was launched in 1999 aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; during STS-93 into an elliptical high-Earth orbit, and was initially named the Advanced X-ray Astronomical Facility (AXAF). It remains in active operation .

The Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) observed the infrared spectrum. It was launched in 2003 aboard a Delta II rocket into an Earth-trailing solar orbit. Depletion of its liquid helium coolant in 2009 reduced its functionality, leaving it with only two short-wavelength imaging modules. It was removed from service and placed into safe-mode on January 30, 2020.

== Origins of the Great Observatory program ==
The concept of a Great Observatory program was first proposed in the 1979 NRC report &quot;A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s&quot;. This report laid the essential groundwork for the Great Observatories and was chaired by Peter Meyer (through June 1977) and then by Harlan J. Smith (through publication). In the mid-1980s, it was further advanced by all of the astrophysics Division Directors at NASA headquarters, including Frank Martin and Charlie Pellerin. NASA&#x27;s &quot;Great Observatories&quot; program used four separate satellites, each designed to cover a different part of the spectrum in ways which terrestrial systems could not. This perspective enabled the proposed X-ray and InfraRed observatories to be appropriately seen as a continuation of the astronomical program begun with Hubble and CGRO rather than competitors or replacements. Two explanatory documents published by NASA and created for the NASA Astrophysics Division and the NASA Astrophysics Management Working Group laid out the rationale for the suite of observatories and questions that could be addressed across the spectrum. They had an important role in the campaign to win and sustain approval for the four telescopes.

== Great Observatories ==
=== Hubble Space Telescope ===


The history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back to 1946, when the astronomer Lyman Spitzer wrote the paper &quot;Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory&quot;. Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for a space telescope.

The 1966–1972 Orbiting Astronomical Observatory missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy. In 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a 3-meter mirror, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. Congress eventually approved funding of US$36 million for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983. During the early 1980s, the telescope was named after Edwin Hubble.

Hubble was originally intended to be retrieved and returned to Earth by the Space Shuttle, but the retrieval plan was later abandoned. On 31 October 2006, NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin gave the go-ahead for a final refurbishment mission. The 11-day STS-125 mission by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;, launched on 11 May 2009, installed fresh batteries, replaced all gyroscopes, replaced a command computer, fixed several instruments, and installed the Wide Field Camera 3 and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.

=== Compton Gamma Ray Observatory ===


Gamma rays had been examined above the atmosphere by several early space missions. During its High Energy Astronomy Observatory Program in 1977, NASA announced plans to build a &quot;great observatory&quot; for gamma-ray astronomy. The Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), renamed Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO), was designed to take advantage of the major advances in detector technology during the 1980s. Following 14 years of effort, the CGRO was launched on 5 April 1991. One of the three gyroscopes on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory failed in December 1999. Although the observatory was fully functional with two gyroscopes, NASA judged that failure of a second gyroscope would result in inability to control the satellite during its eventual return to Earth due to orbital decay. NASA chose instead to preemptively de-orbit Compton on 4 June 2000. Parts that survived reentry splashed into the Pacific Ocean.

=== Chandra X-ray Observatory ===


In 1976 the Chandra X-ray Observatory (called AXAF at the time) was proposed to NASA by Riccardo Giacconi and Harvey Tananbaum. Preliminary work began the following year at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). In the meantime, in 1978, NASA launched the first imaging X-ray telescope, Einstein Observatory (HEAO-2), into orbit. Work continued on the Chandra project through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992, to reduce costs, the spacecraft was redesigned. Four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. Chandra&#x27;s planned orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one third of the way to the Moon&#x27;s at its farthest point. This eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair by the Space Shuttle but put the observatory above the Earth&#x27;s radiation belts for most of its orbit.

=== Spitzer Space Telescope ===


By the early 1970s, astronomers began to consider the possibility of placing an infrared telescope above the obscuring effects of atmosphere of Earth. Most of the early concepts, envisioned repeated flights aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. This approach was developed in an era when the Shuttle program was presumed to be capable of supporting weekly flights of up to 30 days duration. In 1979, a National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences report, &quot;A Strategy for Space Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 1980s&quot;, identified a &quot;Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility&quot; (SIRTF) as &quot;one of two major astrophysics facilities [to be developed] for Spacelab,&quot; a Shuttle-borne platform.

The launch of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, an Explorer-class satellite designed to conduct the first infrared survey of the sky led to anticipation of an instrument using new infrared detector technology. By September 1983, NASA was considering the &quot;possibility of a long duration [free-flyer] SIRTF mission&quot;. The 1985 Spacelab-2 flight aboard STS-51-F confirmed the Shuttle environment was not well suited to an onboard infrared telescope, and a free-flying design was better. The first word of the name was changed from &quot;Shuttle&quot; so it would be called the Space Infrared Telescope Facility.

Spitzer was the only one of the Great Observatories not launched by the Space Shuttle. It was originally intended to be so launched, but after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, the Centaur LH2/LOX upper stage that would have been required to push it into a heliocentric orbit was banned from Shuttle use. Titan and Atlas launch vehicles were canceled for cost reasons. After redesign and lightening, it was launched in 2003 by a Delta II launch vehicle instead. It was called the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) before launch. The telescope was deactivated when operations ended on 30 January 2020.

== Timeline ==
== Strengths ==
Since the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere prevents X-rays, gamma-rays and far-infrared radiation from reaching the ground, space missions were essential for the Compton, Chandra and Spitzer observatories. Hubble also benefits from being above the atmosphere, as the atmosphere blurs ground-based observations of very faint objects, decreasing spatial resolution (however brighter objects can be imaged in much higher resolution than by Hubble from the ground using astronomical interferometers or adaptive optics). Larger, ground-based telescopes have only recently matched Hubble in resolution for near-infrared wavelengths of faint objects. Being above the atmosphere eliminates the problem of airglow, allowing Hubble to make observations of ultrafaint objects. Ground-based telescopes cannot compensate for airglow on ultrafaint objects, and so very faint objects require unwieldy and inefficient exposure times. Hubble can also observe at ultraviolet wavelengths which do not penetrate the atmosphere.

Each observatory was designed to push the state of technology in its region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compton was much larger than any gamma-ray instruments flown on the previous HEAO missions, opening entirely new areas of observation. It had four instruments covering the 20 keV to 30 GeV energy range, which complemented each other&#x27;s sensitivities, resolutions, and fields of view. Gamma rays are emitted by various high-energy and high-temperature sources, such as black holes, pulsars, and supernovae.

Chandra similarly had no ground predecessors. It followed the three NASA HEAO Program satellites, notably the highly successful Einstein Observatory, which was the first to demonstrate the power of grazing-incidence, focusing X-ray optics, giving spatial resolution an order of magnitude better than collimated instruments (comparable to optical telescopes), with an enormous improvement in sensitivity. Chandra&#x27;s large size, high orbit, and sensitive CCDs allowed observations of very faint X-ray sources.

Spitzer also observes at wavelength largely inaccessible to ground telescopes. It was preceded in space by NASA&#x27;s smaller IRAS mission and European Space Agency (ESA)&#x27;s large ISO telescope. Spitzer&#x27;s instruments took advantage of the rapid advances in infrared detector technology since IRAS, combined with its large aperture, favorable fields of view, and long life. Science returns were accordingly outstanding. Infrared observations are necessary for very distant astronomical objects where all the visible light is redshifted to infrared wavelengths, for cool objects which emit little visible light, and for regions optically obscured by dust.

== Synergies ==
Aside from inherent mission capabilities (particularly sensitivities, which cannot be replicated by ground observatories), the Great Observatories program allows missions to interact for greater science return. Different objects shine in different wavelengths, but training two or more observatories on an object allows a deeper understanding.

High-energy studies (in X-rays and gamma rays) have had only moderate imaging resolutions so far. Studying X-ray and gamma-ray objects with Hubble, as well as Chandra and Compton, gives accurate size and positional data. In particular, Hubble&#x27;s resolution can often discern whether the target is a standalone object, or part of a parent galaxy, and if a bright object is in the nucleus, arms, or halo of a spiral galaxy. Similarly, the smaller aperture of Spitzer means that Hubble can add finer spatial information to a Spitzer image. Reported in March 2016, Spitzer and Hubble were used to discover the most distant-known galaxy, GN-z11. This object was seen as it appeared 13.4 billion years ago. (List of the most distant astronomical objects)

Ultraviolet studies with Hubble also reveal the temporal states of high-energy objects. X-rays and gamma rays are harder to detect with current technologies than visible and ultraviolet. Therefore, Chandra and Compton needed long integration times to gather enough photons. However, objects which shine in X-rays and gamma rays can be small, and can vary on timescales of minutes or seconds. Such objects then call for followup with Hubble or the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, which can measure details in angular seconds or fractions of a second, due to different designs. Rossi&#x27;s last full year of operation was 2011.

The ability of Spitzer to see through dust and thick gases is good for galactic nuclei observations. Massive objects at the hearts of galaxies shine in X-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves, but infrared studies into these clouded regions can reveal the number and positions of objects.

Hubble, meanwhile, has neither the field of view nor the available time to study all interesting objects. Worthwhile targets are often found with ground telescopes, which are cheaper, or with smaller space observatories, which are sometimes expressly designed to cover large areas of the sky. Also, the other three Great Observatories have found interesting new objects, which merit diversion of Hubble.

One example of observatory synergy is Solar System and asteroid studies. Small bodies, such as small moons and asteroids, are too small and/or distant to be directly resolved even by Hubble; their image appears as a diffraction pattern determined by brightness, not size. However, the minimum size can be deduced by Hubble through knowledge of the body&#x27;s albedo. The maximum size can be determined by Spitzer through knowledge of the body&#x27;s temperature, which is largely known from its orbit. Thus, the body&#x27;s true size is bracketed. Further spectroscopy by Spitzer can determine the chemical composition of the object&#x27;s surface, which limits its possible albedos, and therefore sharpens the low size estimate.

At the opposite end of the cosmic distance ladder, observations made with Hubble, Spitzer and Chandra have been combined in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey to yield a multi-wavelength picture of galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe.

== Impact ==
All four telescopes have had a substantial impact on astronomy. The opening up of new wavebands to high resolution, high sensitivity observations by the Compton, Chandra and Spitzer has revolutionized our understanding of a wide range of astronomical objects, and has led to the detection of thousands of new, interesting objects. Hubble has had a much larger public and media impact than the other telescopes, although at optical wavelengths Hubble has provided a more modest improvement in sensitivity and resolution over existing instruments. Hubble&#x27;s capability for uniform high-quality imaging of any astronomical object at any time has allowed accurate surveys and comparisons of large numbers of astronomical objects. The Hubble Deep Field observations have been very important for studies of distant galaxies, as they provide rest-frame ultraviolet images of these objects with a similar number of pixels across the galaxies as previous ultraviolet images of closer galaxies, allowing direct comparison.

== Successors to Great Observatories ==
* The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) launched in December 2021 and works simultaneously with Hubble. Its segmented, deployable mirror is over twice as wide as the Hubble&#x27;s, increasing angular resolution noticeably, and sensitivity dramatically. Unlike Hubble, JWST observes in the infrared, in order to penetrate dust at cosmological distances. This means it continues some Spitzer capabilities, while some Hubble capabilities are lost in the visible and especially the ultraviolet wavelengths. JWST exceeds Spitzer&#x27;s performance in near-infrared. The European Space Agency&#x27;s Herschel Space Observatory, operational from 2009 to 2013, has exceeded Spitzer in the far-infrared. The SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) airborne platform observed in near- and mid-infrared. SOFIA had a larger aperture than Spitzer, but lower relative sensitivity.
* The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGRST), formerly known as the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope, is a follow-on to Compton launched on 11 June 2008. FGRST is more narrowly defined, and much smaller; it carries only one main instrument and a secondary experiment, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). FGRST is complemented by Swift, launched in 2004, and previously by HETE-2, launched in 2000. 
* The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI), observed in some Compton and Chandra wavelengths between its February 2002 launch and April 2023 decommissioning. RHESSI was pointed at the Sun at all times, but it occasionally observed high-energy objects in its peripheral view.
* Another large, high-energy observatory is INTEGRAL, Europe&#x27;s INTErnational Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, launched in 2002. It observes in similar frequencies to Compton. INTEGRAL uses a fundamentally different telescope technology, coded-aperture masks. Thus, its capabilities are complementary to Compton and Fermi.

== Later programs ==
* The Beyond Einstein program will seek to develop new areas of science. Constellation-X and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) have been referred to by NASA as the Einstein Great Observatories, to differentiate them from the current generation. However, they are not a part of the Great Observatories program.

* The International Solar-Terrestrial Physics Science Initiative (ISTP), in the spirit of the Great Observatories program, is a group of instruments to study the Sun and related electromagnetic phenomena near Earth.

== Next Great Observatory ==
In 2016, NASA began considering four different Flagship space telescopes, they are the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx), Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR), Origins Space Telescope (OST), and Lynx X-ray Observatory. In 2019, the four teams will turn their final reports over to the National Academy of Sciences, whose independent Decadal Survey committee advises NASA on which mission should take top priority.

NASA announced the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in 2023, a successor building on the Large UV Optical Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) and Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEX) proposals. The administration also created the Great Observatory Maturation Program for the development of the Habitable Worlds Observatory.

<doc id="723996" wikidata="Q7975679" url="?curid=723996" title="Wax bullet">
<text>A wax bullet is a non-lethal projectile made of wax material — often paraffin wax or some mixture of waxes and other substances that produce the desired consistency — that mimics the external ballistics but not the terminal effects of real bullets. Due to the low weight and density, wax bullets are typically used in a primed centerfire cartridge with little to no propellant powders, as often the primer ignition alone can provide all the necessary energy needed to propel the wax bullet out.

Due to the lack of propellants, wax bullet cartridges do not provide enough recoil/blowback energy to cycle self-loading firearms, so they are most commonly used in revolvers and other manually cycled firearms. Specially designed cartridges and conversion kits can be used together to convert semi-/fully automatic firearms into wax bullet guns, used in tactical training for police and military.

Wax bullets have been in use for over a century in military training, target shooting and confrontational shooting competitions where using real metallic bullets would be needlessly hazardous and impractical. In the past, wax bullets were also used by illusionists for illusions involving firearms, such as the bullet catch. This practice goes back at least as far as Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, who used hollow wax bullets colored to resemble lead balls. When placed on a charge of gunpowder, the wax bullet would disintegrate upon firing.

== Construction ==
Wax bullets can be easily constructed by using a cartridge case to punch a cylinder out of a sheet of paraffin wax, and then priming the cartridge using normal handloading equipment. The optional addition of beeswax and/or grease will produce a softer, more flexible bullet than pure paraffin. Higher velocities may be obtained using special cartridges drilled out to accept shotgun primers, which provide higher velocities, and some fast draw competitions allow the use of a small amount of black powder or black powder substitute to provide higher velocities for certain events. Commercially produced wax bullets are also available, and may be required for competitions. These pre-formed bullets are simply pressed into the case mouth.

== Usage ==
=== Shooting sport ===

Fast draw and trick shooters often use wax bullets for safety reasons, so that if they accidentally shoot themselves in the foot or leg when drawing from their holsters, they are not seriously injured. The World Fast Draw Association uses wax bullets in many of their competitions, along with special &quot;balloon popping&quot; blanks that fire coarsely ground gunpowder. Bullets used in WFDA and other similar competitions must be commercially manufactured, and there are a number of manufacturers who produce wax bullets for this purpose.

During the early 20th century, there was some interest in mock pistol dueling using wax bullets. The sport first gained popularity in France where in 1901 Dr Paul Devillers, who was also a keen ‘duellist’, designed a new innovative wax bullet for duelling practice. Heavy canvas clothing was worn to protect the body, a metal helmet with a thick glass plate protected the head and face and the pistols were often equipped with guards on the front of the trigger guard that extended outwards to protect the shooter&#x27;s hand. For a brief time it was popular. 

It was featured as an associate (non-medal) event during the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.

=== Target practice ===
There are a number of other low velocity, low mass projectiles available to shooters. Rubber or plastic bullets designed for short range target shooting with primed cases can also be purchased; these are generally reusable if a proper bullet trap is used, but are prone to ricochet. With wax bullets, a simple sheet of plywood is sufficient to stop the bullet—upon impact the wax deforms and sticks to the wood, where it can later be scraped off and reused. The cost per round of wax bullets is low as primers can be purchased for under US$ 2.00 per 100 in case lots and as the wax itself can be reused. Reloading is very quick, and requires minimal equipment: a decapper tool to knock out the used primer and a priming tool. With these, loading 50 rounds of wax bullets will take under ten minutes. Wax bullets are normally used only in revolvers and single shot pistols for short range target practice. Magazine fed firearms can use wax bullets, but they may need to be fed individually.

=== Combat training ===

The US military uses 5.56 mm non-lethal marking rounds in training. The bullet has two primers. The forward primer propels a wax-filled projectile that marks with colored wax upon contact. The wax washes out with normal laundry procedures.

Simunitions (for &quot;simulated munitions&quot;) are special cartridges that fire colored paint-filled plastic projectiles which are used to mark targets much like paintballs. Simunitions are designed to cycle the actions in specially modified semi-automatic rifles and pistols. The paint-filled plastic projectiles are more durable and accurate than paintballs, and it is safe to be shot by them when wearing protective clothing. Simunitions are used by police and military forces for realistic training. Unlike normal wax bullets, simunitions are not an inexpensive substitute for live ammunition—costs for simunitions cartridges are as much as three times the cost of live ammunition.

===Capital punishment===

A member of firing squad might be issued a wax bullet to prevent members from knowing who fired the lethal shots.

==Magic (illusion)==

Wax bullets have been used in the bullet catch trick.

== Safety issues ==
Wax bullets are not normally lethal, and will not penetrate sturdy walls, so they are safe to use indoors or in situations where live ammunition is dangerous due to risk of overpenetration, stray bullets and ricochets. This is not to say that they are entirely safe, as the muzzle velocities are around . This exceeds the velocities of paintballs, and serious damage could be done to sensitive areas, so suitable precautions should be taken when using them.

==Early and personal life ==
Born in Tipton in 1951, Bradbourn was educated at Tipton Grammar School and Wulfrun College and Worcester College, where he obtained a post-graduate Diploma in Municipal Administration in 1972. Raised in the Black Country, he lived in the area until his death. He was awarded the OBE for public and political service in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in 1994.

== Political career ==
Bradbourn was a parliamentary candidate for Wolverhampton South East in the 1992 general election and stood for the European Parliament in County Durham in 1994. Until his election he was adviser to the Conservative Group Leader on Wolverhampton City Council. He held various local authority posts mainly based around planning. He was also the Chairman of the West Midlands Region Conservatives.

After his death, Bradbourn was succeeded by former cricketer Daniel Dalton.

===Expenses claims===
Bradbourn pursued a complaint against the News of the World with the Press Complaints Commission. The &quot;News of the World&quot; then issued this apology &quot;Contrary to the claim in our article &quot;EU blows millions on fact finding freebies for MEPs&quot; (18 May 2008), Philip Bradbourn MEP did not visit Table Mountain or a wine estate during a South Africa trip. We apologise for any embarrassment.&quot;

===Smoking incident===
On 12 September 2007, an article appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; referring to an incident which occurred in the European Parliament (a non-smoking building), where Bradbourn was found smoking in a corridor. When it was pointed out to him that he was not permitted to smoke inside the Parliament, he reportedly responded &quot;I&#x27;m a member. I make the rules.&quot; Bradbourn, however, denied this, saying that his exact words were, &quot;Elected members make the rules in Parliament, not staff.&quot;

===Birmingham confusion===
In 2008 it was discovered that the website of the West Midlands Conservative MEPs showed a photo of Birmingham, Alabama instead of Birmingham, England.

==Death and funeral==
Bradbourn died of bowel cancer on 20 December 2014, at the age of 63, whilst being treated at Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield. Ashley Fox, leader of the Conservative MEPs, said Bradbourn was a &quot;one-off&quot; adding that he was &quot;a much loved character who could always be relied on for a robust intervention and a succinct summary of a political point&quot;. Fox continued: &quot;His no-nonsense approach to politics made him a powerful voice for the West Midlands as well as a resolute defender of the British taxpayers&#x27; interests in Brussels and Strasbourg.&quot;

As Bradbourn died without family, his former political chief of staff Alastair Little was legally declared his next-of-kin so that he could arrange Bradbourn&#x27;s funeral. A funeral and cremation took place on 16 January 2015 at Bushbury crematorium, Wolverhampton.

On 16 February Mr Little was advised by telephone that there had been an administration error at the Central England Co-operative Funeralcare mortuary, and that the wrong body had been released to the undertakers for Bradbourn&#x27;s funeral. A similarly named Philip Bradburn had previously died at University Hospital Birmingham just before Christmas, and had been processed at the same mortuary, which handled bodies for several contracted NHS hospitals within the area. The correct body was then released to the undertakers, and a further funeral and cremation then took place on 23 February 2015 again at Bushbury crematorium. The Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, the Central England Co-operative, the affected undertakers and the crematorium all investigated. Conservative MEP Malcolm Harbour, a friend of Mr Bradbourn, said it was &quot;inexplicable&quot; that such an incident could happen: &quot;We want to make sure this never happens again and I am sure the people who manage the hospital trusts concerned will have a full investigation and will tell everyone the results.&quot;

<text>Philip Bushill-Matthews (15 January 1943 – 10 December 2023) was a British politician who was Conservative Party Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the West Midlands.

==Biography==
At Oxford University he became President of the O.U. Broadcasting Society, and Secretary of the O.U. Dramatic Society (OUDS) in succession to Michael York, with whom he acted in Braham Murray&#x27;s touring productions of &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; and Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;.

After graduating he joined Unilever as a Graduate Trainee, spending much of his career at Birds Eye, becoming the youngest director of Birds Eye Wall&#x27;s Ltd in 1981 at the age of 38. Overall he spent some thirty years in food manufacturing running businesses in the UK, Portugal and the Netherlands. Unhappy about the general lack of business experience among politicians from all parties he decided to enter politics himself and was elected to the European Parliament representing his home region of the West Midlands in 1999. He was then re-elected for a second five-year term in 2004, this time as head of the Conservative regional list. In addition to his position as MEP, he was a former leader of the Conservative group in Brussels.

In his first term, as a member of the Environment and Public Health Committee he played an important role in negotiating amendments to the Chocolate Directive, which would finally enable British dairy milk chocolate to be sold throughout the EU. Meanwhile, fed up with the response from the Labour Government back home to the continued boycott of British beef by France for blatantly protectionist reasons, he joined ten other colleagues in a demonstration in Paris in autumn 1999. They carried a banner with the slogan &#x27;Marie Antoinette said &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;, British Conservative MEPs say &quot;Let them eat British beef&quot;.&#x27;

Bushill-Matthews was appointed Conservative Spokesman for Employment &amp; Social Affairs immediately following his first election as an MEP, and held this position for ten years. In 2007 he was also elected Co-ordinator for Employment and Social Affairs for the Group of the European People&#x27;s Party and European Democrats. His aim was to ensure that EU legislation was proportionate and realistic, and employment opportunities helped not hindered in the process. He was instrumental in preserving the UK individual opt-out from the Working Time Directive and promoting Corporate Social Responsibility as voluntary. German MEPs called him Philip the Fighter because of his tenacity in persuading colleagues to support his legislative arguments.

Having been elected Deputy Leader of the Conservative MEPs in November 2007, in June 2008 Bushill-Matthews was elected Leader after Giles Chichester chose to step down in order to clear his name following allegations of withdrawing parliamentary funds for private use. During his leadership he put in place a &#x27;Right to Know&#x27; system whereby Conservative MEPs openly declared their expenses on line. While Leader he fell out briefly with David Cameron who wanted to pull Conservative MEPs out of the EPP-ED Group in the middle of the 2004-9 Parliamentary term, despite the fact that his predecessor (and each of the individual MEPs) had signed a binding commitment to stay in for the full five-year period.

Bushill-Matthews did not submit his name for re-selection at the 2009 European elections and stood down as MEP in June 2009. In 2011 he was appointed a non-executive director of the Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust, and elected vice-chairman in 2012. He briefly came out of political retirement in 2016 to campaign for Remain during the 2016 referendum: his constituency of Warwick &amp; Leamington was one of two constituencies in the West Midlands to vote to stay in along with neighbouring Kenilworth &amp; Southam.

Bushill-Matthews was the author of &quot;The Gravy Train&quot; published in 2003 (with a foreword by William Hague) and &quot;Who Rules Britannia?&quot; in 2005. His third book, &quot;The Eras of La Gomera&quot;, was published in summer 2018. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Directors.

In September 2019, Bushill-Matthews joined the Liberal Democrats.

Bushill-Matthews died after a long illness in Coventry, on 10 December 2023, at the age of 80.

<doc id="724012" wikidata="Q2670750" url="?curid=724012" title="Truxton (video game)">
<text>Truxton is a 1988 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed by Toaplan and published in Japan and Europe by Taito, as well as in North America by Midway. Set in a future where the Gidans alien race led by Dogurava invaded the fictional planet Borogo, players assume the role of fighter pilot Tatsuo taking control of the Super Fighter ship on a last-ditch effort to overthrow the alien invaders.

&quot;Truxton&quot; was conceived by Masahiro Yuge during his time working at Toaplan, who wanted to create a scrolling shooter where memorization was its main focus, inheriting previously established ideas from &quot;Slap Fight&quot; and was developed in conjunction with &quot;Hellfire&quot;, although work on the project had already started privately during production of &quot;Twin Cobra&quot;.

&quot;Truxton&quot; proved to be a commercial success for Toaplan among players in Japanese arcades, earning several awards from &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine, however it was less successful in western regions and was met with mixed reception from game magazines. The game has since been released on multiple platforms, each one featuring changes and additions compared to the original version. A sequel, &quot;Truxton II&quot;, was released in 1992 on arcades. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Yuge.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Truxton&quot; is a science fiction-themed vertically scrolling shoot &#x27;em up game where players assume the role of Tatsuo taking control of the Super Fighter ship through five increasingly difficult levels, each with a boss at the end that must be fought, in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the invading Gidans led by Dogurava as the main objective. Players control their craft over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving. The main ship only has two weapons: the main gun that travels a max distance of the screen&#x27;s height and three bombs capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its blast radius.

Similar to &quot;Twin Cobra&quot;, there are three types of weapons that can be acquired by destroying incoming carriers, ranging from the red wide-reaching shot, the blue homing laser and the green straight beam. The ship&#x27;s firepower is upgraded by picking up multiple &quot;P&quot; icons in a row and can switch between any of the three weapons by collecting the respective color of each one. Other items can also be picked up along the way such as 1UPs and speed increasers.

The game employs a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. There are also hidden bonus secrets to reveal by meeting certain requirements during gameplay. Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a life, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship&#x27;s firepower to its original state, in addition of all medals collected and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. The game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage, with the second loop increasing in difficulty.

== Synopsis ==
The plot summary of &quot;Truxton&quot; varies between each version and is explained through supplementary materials. Taking place somewhere in space, an armada of Gidans led by the evil Dogurava is invading the fictional planet Borogo aboard five gargantuan asteroids. After surviving an attack on an orbiting Borogo cargo barge, a pilot named Tatsuo enters into one remaining ship called Super Fighter and challenges the Gidans in a desperate attempt to quell the alien invasion and divert their asteroid fortresses in the process.

== Development ==
&quot;Truxton&quot; was the creation of former Toaplan programmer Masahiro Yuge, whose previous development works at the company included &quot;Tiger-Heli&quot;, &quot;Slap Fight&quot; and &quot;Twin Cobra&quot;, becoming his first original project under the role of both producer and composer. Yuge wanted to create a scrolling shooter game where players would become increasingly better at the more they were able to remember specific stage designs and secrets, focusing on creating sections in levels that required a specific weapon to defeat certain enemies, while Tatsuya Uemura stated that the project was developed in conjunction with &quot;Hellfire&quot;.

Many of the design choices, such as the memorization feature and its usage of secrets, were derived from ideas previously established in &quot;Slap Fight&quot;. The blue homing laser was based on a dream Yuge had, which featured a powerful laser that wiped out most enemies on the screen, and was implemented to be both the main weapon and a selling point. Level design was one of the main areas of the project, as Yuge didn&#x27;t want sections that could easily be memorized to the point of making them boring. &quot;Safespots&quot; were intentionally added to levels to allow breathing room for players, while the lack of a cooperative two-player mode was cited by Yuge as being against the game&#x27;s theme and would have made the memorization mechanic a pointless addition.

Naoki Ogiwara, Sanae Nitō and Yuko Tataka acted as game designers in the development cycle. Ogiwara had already began work on designs for &quot;Truxton&quot; in secret during production of &quot;Twin Cobra&quot; due to his interest in creating science fiction artwork, which were finished after the latter was completed and gave inspirations to the team with enemy patterns. The Sega Genesis version was developed in-house by the same staff from the original arcade release after Sega discussed with Toaplan in regards of a conversion for their console. Both Uemura and Tataka have stated that working with the Genesis proved to be difficult due to several restrictions imposed by the hardware.

== Release ==
&quot;Truxton&quot; was released in October 1988 in Japan, where it was published by Taito. It was later released in February 1989 for both Europe and North America, published respectively by Taito and Midway. The Japanese version was named &quot;Tatsujin&quot;, based on the Japanese word for &quot;master&quot;. It became Toaplan&#x27;s first game to have their logo displayed on the title screen and their name credited. On 25 June 1989, an album containing music from the title and other Toaplan games was published exclusively in Japan by Datam Polystar.

In December 1989, &quot;Truxton&quot; was ported to the Sega Genesis by Toaplan and was first released in Japan and North America by Sega, who later distributed the title across Europe in November 1990. The Genesis port stays faithful to the original arcade release but has a number of key differences such as having a smaller color palette that lead to sprites being recolored in different ways, along with other presentation and gameplay changes from the original version. The Genesis port was later re-released by independent publisher Retro-Bit in 2020.

&quot;Truxton&quot; later received a conversion to the PC Engine by Sting Entertainment and published exclusively in Japan by Taito on 24 July 1992. The PC Engine release has visual and audio changes but introduces an options menu where multiple gameplay settings can be altered. A version for the Sharp X68000 was in development and planned to be published by Kaneko, but despite being advertised in Japanese publications such as &quot;Oh!X&quot;, this version was never released to the market for unknown reasons. In September 2019, &quot;Truxton&quot; was re-released for iOS and Android mobile devices only in Japan by MOBIRIX Corporation under the name &quot;Tatsujin Classic&quot;. In July 2022, the original arcade version was included as part of the Sega Astro City Mini V, a vertically oriented variant of the Sega Astro City mini console. &quot;Truxton&quot; was also included as part of the &quot;Toaplan Arcade 1&quot; compilation for Evercade on 15 December of the same year. In February 2023, a Microsoft Windows version published by Bitwave Games was released on Steam and GOG.com.

== Reception ==
&quot;Truxton&quot;, since its original arcade release, was met with mixed response from critics. According to Masahiro Yuge, the game sold well in Japan but proved to be less successful in western regions. &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it on their 15 November 1988 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles such as &quot;Scramble Spirits&quot; and &quot;World Stadium&quot;. The Sega Genesis version was well received when it was released, with &quot;Mean Machines&quot; summarising the game as &quot;a fine example of a pure, no-frills arcade blast&quot;. &quot;MegaTech&quot; said that although original features were distinctly lacking, &quot;it&#x27;s a good solid blast which offers plenty of action, speed and excitement&quot;. Likewise, the PC Engine version was also well received. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked Truxton 95th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

== Legacy ==
A sequel, &quot;Truxton II&quot;, was released in 1992 for the arcades and later ported to the FM Towns. In more recent years, the rights to the game and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after its Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by Masahiro Yuge, and is part of Embracer Group since 2022. The Super Fighter ship appears in &quot;Game Tengoku CruisnMix&quot; for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. Artist Perry &quot;Gryzor/Rozyrg&quot; Sessions cited &quot;Truxton&quot; as one of the main influences for &quot;Super XYX&quot;. A third entry, named &quot;Truxton Extreme&quot;, was announced by Tatsujin in 2023, as a PlayStation 5-exclusive title.

<doc id="724031" wikidata="Q3743255" url="?curid=724031" title="Henry H. Goddard">
<text>Henry Herbert Goddard (August 14, 1866 – June 18, 1957) was an American psychologist, eugenicist, and segregationist during the early 20th century. He is known especially for his 1912 work &quot;The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness&quot;, which he himself came to regard as flawed for its ahistoric depiction of the titular family, and for translating the Binet-Simon Intelligence Test into English in 1908 and distributing an estimated 22,000 copies of the translated test across the United States. He also introduced the term &quot;moron&quot; for clinical use.

He was the main advocate for the use of intelligence testing in societal institutions including hospitals, schools, the legal system and the military. He helped develop the new topic of clinical psychology, in 1911 helped to write the first U.S. law requiring that blind, deaf and intellectually disabled children be provided special education within public school systems, and in 1914 became the first American psychologist to testify in court that subnormal intelligence should limit the criminal responsibility of defendants.

==Early life==
Goddard was born in Vassalboro, Maine, the fifth and youngest child and only son of farmer Henry Clay Goddard and his wife, Sarah Winslow Goddard, who were devout Quakers. (Two of his sisters died in infancy.) His father was gored by a bull when the younger Goddard was a small child, and he eventually lost his farm and had to work as a farmhand; he died of his lingering injuries when the boy was nine years old. The younger Goddard went to live with his married sister for a brief time but in 1877 was enrolled at the Oak Grove Seminary, a boarding school in Vassalboro.

During this period, Sarah Goddard began a new career as a traveling Quaker preacher; she married missionary Jehu Newlin in 1884, and the couple regularly traveled throughout the United States and Europe. In 1878, Henry Goddard became a student at the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island. During his youth he began an enduring friendship with Rufus Jones, who would later co-found (in 1917) the American Friends Service Committee, which received the 1947 Nobel Peace Prize.

In 1883 Goddard entered Haverford College, where he played on the football team, graduating in 1887. He adjourned his studies for a year to teach in Winthrop, Maine, from 1885 to 1886. After graduating, he traveled to California to visit one of his sisters, stopping en route in Los Angeles to present some letters of introduction at the University of Southern California, which had been established just seven years earlier. After seeking jobs in the Oakland area for several weeks, he was surprised to receive an offer of a temporary position at USC, and there he taught Latin, history and botany. He also served as co-coach (with Frank Suffel) of the first USC football team in 1888, with the team winning both of its games against a local athletic club. But he departed immediately thereafter, returning to Haverford to earn his master&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1889.

From 1889 to 1891, he became principal of the Damascus Academy, a Quaker school in Damascus, Ohio, where he also taught several subjects and conducted chapel services and prayer meetings. On August 7, 1889, he married Emma Florence Robbins, who became one of the two other teachers at the academy. In 1891 he returned to teach at the Oak Grove Seminary in Vassalboro, becoming principal in 1893. He enrolled in 1896 at Clark University, intending to study only briefly, but he remained three years and received his doctorate in psychology in 1899. He then taught at the State Normal School in West Chester, Pennsylvania until 1906.

==Vineland==
From 1906 to 1918, Goddard was the Director of Research at the Vineland Training School for Feeble-Minded Girls and Boys in Vineland, New Jersey, which was the first known laboratory established to study intellectual disability. While there, he is quoted as stating: &quot;Democracy, then, means that the people rule by &quot;selecting&quot; the wisest, most intelligent and most human to tell them what to do to be happy.&quot; [Italics are Goddard&#x27;s.]

At the May 18, 1910, annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of the Feeble-Minded, Goddard proposed definitions for a system for classifying individuals with intellectual disability based on intelligence quotient (IQ). Goddard used the terms moron for those with an IQ of 51–70, imbecile for those with an IQ of 26–50, and idiot for those with an IQ of 0-25 for categories of increasing impairment. This nomenclature was standard for decades. A moron, by his definition, was any adult with a mental age between eight and twelve. Morons, according to Goddard, were unfit for society and should be removed from society either through institutionalization, sterilization, or both.

Goddard&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;The Kallikak Family&quot;, was published in 1912. He had studied the background of several local groups of people that were somewhat distantly related and concluded that they were all descended from a single Revolutionary War soldier. Martin Kallikak (a pseudonym) first married a Quaker woman. All of the children who came from this relationship were &quot;wholesome&quot; and had no signs of intellectual disability. Later, it was discovered that Kallikak had had an affair with a &quot;nameless feeble-minded woman&quot;. The result of this union resulted in generations of criminals. Goddard termed this generation &quot;a race of defective degenerates&quot;. While the book rapidly became a success and was considered for making into a Broadway play, his research methods were soon questioned; within ten years he came to agree with the critics and no longer endorsed his conclusions.
It is now accepted that Goddard in fact fabricated the Kallikak data, rendering his conclusions unproven and highly dubious.

Goddard was a strong advocate of eugenics. Although he believed that &quot;feeble-minded&quot; people bearing children was inadvisable, he hesitated to promote compulsory sterilization – even though he was convinced that it would eliminate intellectual disability – because he did not think such a plan could gain widespread acceptance. Instead, he suggested that colonies should be established where the &quot;feeble-minded&quot; could be segregated.

Goddard established an intelligence testing program on Ellis Island in 1913. The purpose of the program was to identify &quot;feeble-minded&quot; persons whose nature was not obvious to the subjective judgement of immigration officers, who had previously made these judgments without the aid of tests. When he published the results in 1917, Goddard stated that his results only applied to immigrants traveling steerage and did not apply to people traveling in first or second class. He also noted that the population he studied had been preselected, omitting those who were either &quot;obviously normal&quot; or &quot;obviously feeble-minded&quot;, and stated that he made &quot;no attempt to determine the percentage of feeble-minded among immigrants in general or even of the special groups named – the Jews, Hungarians, Italians, and Russians&quot;; however, he immediately followed this up by stating that &quot;the figures would only need to be revised (reduced) by a relatively small amount&quot; because &quot;[very obviously high-grade intelligent immigrants] were so small a part of the group [of Ellis Island immigrants] that they did not noticeably affect the character of the group.&quot;

The program found an estimated 80% of the population of immigrants studied were &quot;feeble-minded&quot;. Goddard and his associates tested a group of 35 Jewish, 22 Hungarian, 50 Italian, and 45 Russian immigrants who had been identified as &quot;representative of their respective groups&quot;. The results found that 83% of Jews, 80% of Hungarians, 79% of Italians, and 80% of Russians of the study population were &quot;feeble-minded&quot;. The untrue claim that this referred to findings made by Goddard in respect to the greater population of Jewish, Hungarian, Italian and Russian immigrants has been widely publicized. Not trusting such extreme results, Goddard then adjusted the threshold of &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot; such that only about 40% of the immigrants were deemed to be morons.

Claims are made that the Immigration Act of 1924 was strongly influenced by intelligence testing, which was backed up by the &quot;American Psychologist&quot;.

Goddard also publicized alleged race-group differences revealed by Army IQ tests (Army Alpha and Beta) during World War I (the results were, even in their day, challenged as scientifically inaccurate, and later resulted in a retraction from the director of the project, Carl Brigham) and claimed that the results showed that Americans were unfit for democracy.

==Later career==
In 1918 he became director of the Ohio Bureau of Juvenile Research, and in 1922 he became a professor in the Department of Abnormal and Clinical Psychology at the Ohio State University, a job he possessed until his retirement in 1938. His wife, Emma, died in October 1936; they did not have any children. He received an honorary law degree from Ohio State in 1943 and an honorary degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. Also in 1946, he was among the endorsers of Albert Einstein&#x27;s Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists.

By the 1920s, Goddard had come to believe that he had made numerous errors in his early research and regarded &quot;The Kallikak Family&quot; as obsolete. It was also noted that Goddard was more concerned about making eugenics popular rather than conducting actual scientific studies. He devoted the later part of his career to seeking improvements in education, reforming environmental influences in childhood, and publicizing better child-rearing practices. But others continued to use his early work to support various arguments with which Goddard did not agree. He was constantly perplexed by the fact that later polemicists claimed that his studies were dangerous to society despite presenting immigrant groups as immoral and less intelligent by falsely claiming the sample was &quot;representative of their respective groups&quot; whilst advocating removal of such people from society. Henry Garrett of Columbia University was one of the few scientists to continue to use &quot;The Kallikak Family&quot; as a reference.

Goddard relocated to Santa Barbara, California, in 1947. He died at his home there at age 90, and his cremated remains were interred with those of his wife at the Siloam Cemetery, Vineland, New Jersey.

<doc id="724050" wikidata="Q2479583" url="?curid=724050" title="Planetary Observer program">
<text>The Planetary Observer program is a cancelled space exploration program designed by NASA to provide cheaper planetary orbiters by using Earth-orbiting satellite components and technology, using solar panels for power, and a common spacecraft bus platform for all Planetary Observer-class probes. Only one spacecraft of this class was eventually constructed—the &quot;Mars Observer&quot;.

== History ==
After the flagship multibillion-dollar missions of the 1970s, in the 1980s NASA was looking for a new, more affordable direction for the 1990s and beyond. Two projects were conceived by NASA&#x27;s Solar System Exploration Committee in 1983, the Planetary Observer program and &quot;Mariner Mark II&quot;. The Observer program, starting with &quot;Mars Observer&quot;, was envisioned as a series of low-cost missions to the inner Solar System, based on commercial Earth satellites. The Mariner Mark II, on the other hand, was to be a series of large spacecraft for the exploration of the outer Solar System.

The first Planetary Observer spacecraft to be approved was &quot;Mars Observer&quot;, in 1985. &quot;Lunar Observer&quot; (LO), proposed for a 1997 launch, would have been sent into a long-term lunar orbit at 60 miles above the Moon&#x27;s poles. The Mercury Observer (MO) was also proposed for a 1997 launch. However, congressionally imposed reductions to FY 1992-93 funding requirements forced NASA to terminate the Planetary Observer program, with just &quot;Mars Observer&quot; funded.

=== &quot;Mars Observer&quot; ===

&quot;Mars Observer&quot; was a robotic spacecraft designed to study the geoscience and climate of Mars. The first of the proposed Observer series of planetary missions, it was launched by NASA on September 25, 1992. Three days before &quot;Mars Observer&quot; was scheduled to enter the orbit of Mars, contact with the spacecraft was lost. Attempts to re-establish communication with the spacecraft were unsuccessful.

A few photographs were indeed taken, and these were the bulk of data collected.

=== &quot;Lunar Observer&quot; ===
The &quot;Lunar Observer&quot; program was started with an estimated budget of US$500–700 million. The proposed orbit was above the surface. The &quot;Lunar Observer&quot; spacecraft garnered some attention from the Soviet Union, and there was a suggestion that they might cooperate with NASA to field some instruments for it.

&quot;Lunar Observer&quot; was proposed for FY1991 at US$188 million by President George H.W. Bush.

<doc id="724067" wikidata="Q5256456" url="?curid=724067" title="Den Dover">
<text>Densmore Ronald Dover (born 4 April 1938) is a British politician. Representing the Conservative Party, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Chorley from 1979 to 1997. He then served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the region of North West England, from 1999 to 2009.

He was forced to resign the position of Chief Whip, before being expelled from the party, over investigations into his expenses, and stood down from the European Parliament at the 2009 European Elections.

==Biography==
Dover was born in Stockton Heath, Cheshire. Educated at King George V School, Southport until transferring to Manchester Grammar School where he won the bowling prize at cricket. Dover gained a First Class Honours degree in Civil Engineering at Manchester University.

===Career===
Dover worked in the construction industry across Europe, working for John Laing plc, George Wimpey, and as Chief Executive for the &quot;National Building Agency&quot;. Dover was latterly Director of Housing Construction with the Greater London Council, before entering politics on a full-time basis when he became an MP.

===Personal life===
Dover is married to Kathleen, with a son and a daughter, Amanda. He plays cricket, golf and hockey.

==Political career==
Dover served on the London Borough of Barnet Council, and was a Member of its Education, Finance and Public Works Committees. He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament at Caerphilly in October 1974, being beaten by Labour&#x27;s Fred Evans.

===MP for Chorley===
Dover served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Chorley, from May 1979 to April 1997, until he was defeated by Labour candidate Lindsay Hoyle, a future Speaker of the House of Commons.

===MEP for North West England===
Dover was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999, and was re-elected in June 2004.

====Resignation====
Dover resigned as Conservative Chief Whip in the European Parliament on 6 June 2008. The revelation that forced the resignation was that over nine years he had paid his wife and daughter £750,000 from public funds. (This came after the Conservatives&#x27; Leader in Europe, Giles Chichester, resigned because he put large sums of money for secretarial and office work through the account of a company of which he was a paid director.)

Dover was forced to resign by acting Conservative MEP Leader, Philip Bushill-Matthews, who had been appointed only a day prior. Dover was replaced as Conservative Chief Whip by Richard Ashworth MEP.

An inquiry by the European Parliament found him guilty of a conflict of interest, and he was ordered to repay £500,000 of the expenses. The Parliament&#x27;s ruling lead to Dover being expelled from the Conservative Party.

Dover&#x27;s case was passed to the European Anti-Fraud Office for investigation. Dover stood down from the European Parliament at the 2009 European Elections. This ruling was later annulled in March 2011. Dover was not required to repay any expenses. Both the EU parliament and Dover were required bear their own costs.

<text>Richard Varick (March 15, 1753 – July 30, 1831) was an American lawyer, military officer, and politician who has been referred to as &quot;The Forgotten Founding Father.&quot; A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and the state of New York, Varick became the 45th Mayor of New York City in 1789 and served eleven consecutive one-year terms until 1801.

Previous to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the 14th Recorder of New York City from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it equates to &#x27;Chief Legal Officer&#x27;. Along with Samuel Jones, Varick codified New York State&#x27;s first statutes after the American Revolution in the Laws of New York (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the legal groundwork for Varick to institute the Law of New York, the New York City Administrative Code, and the Rules of New York City during his terms as mayor. Additionally, under his leadership, the progenitors of the New York City Department of Health, the New York Stock Exchange, and many other organizations would be created. These organizations established the foundation of modern New York City.

During the American Revolutionary War, Varick served as George Washington&#x27;s aide-de-camp and private secretary. Varick&#x27;s body of work from this era would lead to the &quot;Varick Transcripts&quot;, which now live in the Library of Congress. The value of these documents has been noted throughout their lifetime as invaluable to the understanding of the formation of the United States.

Varick was a founder of the Society of the Cincinnati and the American Bible Society, and was a slaveholder. He was also a longtime trustee of Columbia University, where he was chairman of the board from 1810 to 1816.

==Early life and family==
He was born on March 15, 1753, at Hackensack in Bergen County, New Jersey, to John Varick and Jane (née Dey) Varick. Both Varick&#x27;s parents ancestors had emigrated with the Dutch West India Company in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick&#x27;s ancestors are Joris Jansen Rapelje, a member of the Council of Twelve Men which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the Dey Mansion, which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.

Varick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married George Lauder of the Lauder Greenway Family.); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of Simeon De Witt); and Maria Gilbert.

===Education===
Little is known about the specifics of Varick&#x27;s education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King&#x27;s College (the original name of Columbia University) in New York City in 1771 where he studied under John Morin Scott. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King&#x27;s College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King&#x27;s College for over thirty years.

==Military career==
===American Revolutionary War===
====Service under General Schuyler and Northern Army====
 Eight months into his career in private practice, the American Revolutionary War began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the 1st New York Regiment and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General Philip Schuyler who was in command of the Northern Army It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to Fort Ticonderoga and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General Benedict Arnold, who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick&#x27;s life until Arnold&#x27;s treason in 1780.

By the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army&#x27;s deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General Horatio Gates. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick&#x27;s almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.

That same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down Lake Champlain in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the U.S. Navy. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the Battle of Valcour Island ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.

Varick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler&#x27;s faction. General Anthony Walton White, who had briefly served at Washington&#x27;s aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick&#x27;s offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White&#x27;s attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. 
After the disastrous loss of Fort Ticonderoga, Schuyler was removed from duty by the Continental Congress in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Varick and Arnolds circle of friendship had also grown to include Henry Brockholst Livingston and Matthew Clarkson. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as &quot;The New York Gang&quot; by James Wilkinson, a partisan of General Gates&#x27;.

Varick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army&#x27;s deputy muster master general, though not as Gates&#x27; aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780, when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.

====Service under General Arnold====

Varick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City—which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of West Point (then an active military installation) as his aide-de-camp and inspector-general.

Within three months, Arnold&#x27;s treason was discovered and he fled to British territory. Varick, along with David Franks, were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold&#x27;s treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold&#x27;s defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:

“&quot;That Lieutenant Colonel Varick’s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country…&quot;”

====Service under General Washington====
A by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to George Washington, which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army&#x27;s, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision “of a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed”. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at Poughkeepsie, Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the Varick Transcripts. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.

Upon completing the assigned duties after years of work, General Washington wrote:
“&quot;I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties&quot;.&quot;

After he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the New York State Militia until 1801.

=====The Varick Transcripts=====
The Varick Transcripts are deposited in the Library of Congress. The value of these documents has been noted throughout their lifetime as invaluable to the understanding of the formation of the United States.

As originally provisioned by Congress, the stated duties by General Washington to Colonel Varick as Recording Secretary would include categorizing, transcribing, and assembling all Washington&#x27;s papers. The resulting 44 letterbooks contain copies of all documents dating from May, 1775 to June, 1785. Categories of papers, records, and correspondence are organized as follows;
===Society of the Cincinnati===
In 1783 the Society of the Cincinnati was founded of which Varick was an original member and president of the New York chapter from 1783 until his death in 1831. Membership was generally limited to officers who had served at least three years in the Continental Army or Navy. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at Mount Gulian (Verplanck House) in Fishkill, New York, before the British evacuation from New York City. The meeting was chaired by Varick&#x27;s friend Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton. The Society has three goals: &quot;To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.&quot;

Varick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington&#x27;s birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by Mary Simpson ( - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.

==Political career==
===Recorder and Attorney General of New York (1784–1789)===
Varick was the Recorder of New York City from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to &#x27;Chief Legal Officer.&#x27; In this office, along with Samuel Jones, he codified New York State&#x27;s first statutes after Revolution in the Laws of New York (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the foundation for the Law of New York, the New York City Administrative Code, and the Rules of New York City.

Concurrently to the above, he was a member of the New York State Assembly from New York County from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was Speaker during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the New York State Attorney General from 1788 to 1789.

Remarkably, due to the elitist nature of the New York State Constitution of 1777, almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the Council of Appointment. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.

===Mayor of New York City (1789–1801)===
Varick would peak politically as the Mayor of New York City for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801. While Mayor, he would continue his establishment of the technocratic structure that would ensure New York City&#x27;s place as the commercial capital of the United States, despite the political capital moving to Philadelphia, then Washington D.C. At this time in history, there was no precedent of commercial and political leadership split between two cities.

In 1791, the major financial crisis would hit the United States in New York due to a scheme to manipulate the financial markets, which had no formal structure of any kind. Varick would have to increase officers to protect the guilty parties from mobs gathering outside the prison. This would lead to a group of merchants making the &quot;Buttonwood Agreement” in 1792 which was the seed of the New York Stock Exchange.

In the summer of 1793 a yellow fever epidemic sent New Yorkers &quot;fleeing north&quot; to nearby healthful Greenwich Village. This epidemic would lead to the creation of what would become the New York City Department of Health. This was timely as there were further epidemics in 1795, 1796, 1798, 1799, and 1800.

In 1794, public anger at Federalist political ideals spilled into the streets with Varick&#x27;s support of the Jay Treaty. An angry mob would almost physically run him out of the city.

Varick ran into more trouble when he tried to pressure the city&#x27;s 1,000 or so licensed workers — tavern keepers, grocers, butchers and cartmen, all of whom had licenses to work for the city — to vote for Federalist candidates. “This went completely contrary to the egalitarian sentiment of the time,” Dr. Hodges said. 
Varick&#x27;s heavy-handed ways, Dr. Hodges said, pushed many of the workers away from the Federalists, represented by Alexander Hamilton, and into the opposing Democratic-Republican faction, represented by Thomas Jefferson. In 1797, after losing his seat representing New York State in the U.S. Senate, Aaron Burr took control of Tammany Hall and used it to assail Varick for his use of marketing and tax-licensing fees. Burr would win the state&#x27;s electoral vote in the 1800 presidential election leading to a wide sweeping rout of Federalist politicians across New York, including Varick in 1801.

==Post-Political Life==
===Founding of Jersey City===

In 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend Alexander Hamilton to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly Federalists who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by Thomas Jefferson and other Democratic-Republicans. Large tracts of land in Paulus Hook were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and Jacob Radcliff, a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810 to 1811 and again from 1815 to 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in Lower Manhattan or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).
In 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River. The property was landscaped with lawns and gardens to the waterfront. Varick would become the figurehead of the continuing development of Jersey City, inviting luminary friends such as Major General Marquis de Lafayette to visit while touring America in 1824 for special Fourth of July celebrations. Varick would live at Prospect Hall until he died on July 30, 1831.

===Founding of the American Bible Society===

Varick was a founder of the American Bible Society in 1816. He would later become president (succeeding John Jay) in 1828 until his death in 1831.

==Personal life==
He and his wife Maria Roosevelt, daughter of Isaac Roosevelt, were married on May 8, 1786, in New York City. His father-in-law was the patrilineal great-great-grandfather of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

On February 15, 2022, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Richard Varick is on the list of New York City mayors, composed by Sarah Cate Wolfson, a high school student in New York City, who owned slaves.

Varick and his wife initially resided at 52 Wall Street, then moved to a larger home on lower Broadway. They also owned a home at 11 Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan. Their final home was Prospect Hall on Essex Street in Jersey City, New Jersey.

==Death and burial==
Varick died on July 30, 1831, at Prospect Hall and is interred at the First Reformed Dutch Church Cemetery in Hackensack, New Jersey.

==Honorifics==
Varick Street (where he once owned property) in Manhattan in the City of New York, Varick Street in Jersey City, and the Town of Varick, New York, all bear his name.

<text>The Board of Broadcast Governors (BBG) was an arms-length Government of Canada agency. It was created in 1958 by amending the &quot;Broadcast Act&quot; to regulate television and radio broadcasting, originally taking over that function from the CBC.

The BBG was replaced by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in the 1968 amendments to the 1958 Act.

==Board==
The board consisted of 12 members appointed by the federal government:

* 3 full-time members
* 9 part-time

The head of the board was the Governor.

There had only been two Chairmen:

* Dr. Andrew Stewart November 10, 1958 – March 18, 1968
* Pierre Juneau March 18–31, 1968

==History==
In 1957, the Progressive Conservative party intended to change the makeup of the Canadian Broadcast system. Up to that point, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) had been responsible for maintaining broadcast infrastructures, creating programs, and regulating the industry. These roles described the CBC as being both &quot;cop and competitor&quot; and were argued to be separated. The regulatory function was thus given over to a separate regulatory agency, the BBG. through the passage of the Broadcast Act (1958).

<text>Amanda Burton (born 10 October 1956) is a Northern Irish actress. Her notable credits include Heather Haversham in the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; (1982–1986), Beth Glover in the ITV drama series &quot;Peak Practice&quot; (1993–1995), Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series &quot;Silent Witness&quot; (1996–2004, 2022), Clare Blake in the ITV crime drama series &quot;The Commander&quot; (2003–2008), Karen Fisher in the BBC school-based drama series &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; (2010–2011) and Katherine Maguire in the ITV detective series &quot;Marcella&quot; (2020).

==Early life and education==
Burton was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, the youngest of four sisters. Her father, Arthur Burton, was a primary school headmaster at Ballougry Primary School, which she attended as a child. She was raised at Ballougry, a rural townland on the south-western outskirts of Derry City, where her family lived in a house beside Ballougry Primary School, right beside County Londonderry&#x27;s boundary with County Donegal. After later attending Londonderry High School, she moved to England at the age of 18, where she spent three years studying drama at the Manchester Metropolitan School of Theatre.

==Career==
Although best known for her television roles, Burton had worked almost exclusively in the theatre prior to landing the role of Heather Haversham in Channel 4&#x27;s Liverpool-based flagship drama series &quot;Brookside&quot;. After nearly four years in the role, during which time Heather had become one of the show&#x27;s most popular residents of Brookside Close, she began to lose sympathy with her character and decided to leave. Following her departure her television work consisted mainly of guest appearances, with parts in a number of peak-time drama series including &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;Medics&quot;, &quot;Van Der Valk&quot;, &quot;Stay Lucky&quot; and &quot;Lovejoy&quot;.

In 1993, Burton starred alongside Kevin Whately in &quot;Peak Practice&quot;. She played the role of Doctor Beth Glover in the medical drama series, based in Derbyshire&#x27;s Peak District, for three series until her departure in 1995. In 1996 she then took the main role of Professor Sam Ryan in the highly acclaimed BBC drama &quot;Silent Witness&quot;; she held this role until 2004. Though her decision to portray Ryan as a reflective personality – sometimes staring into space – was satirised by the comedienne Jennifer Saunders, she helped lay the groundwork for what was to become one of the most popular BBC series, continuing to run, albeit without her, until her return in 2021.

After &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, she took on the title role of Prosecutor Helen West in a series based on Frances Fyfield&#x27;s novels. She also played Aunt Polly in a 2003 remake of &quot;Pollyanna&quot; and Commander Clare Blake in Lynda La Plante&#x27;s drama, &quot;The Commander&quot;.

In 2010, Burton appeared in the sixth series of BBC drama &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; as new headteacher Karen Fisher, and departed the show in 2011. She took part in BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot; and made it through to the semi-finals. She appeared as gangster&#x27;s wife Cherie Le Saux in ITV drama &quot;The Level&quot; in Autumn 2016. In 2020, she had a starring role as crime family matriarch Katherine Maguire in the third season of &quot;Marcella&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1976 Burton married theatre technician Jonathan Hartley, whom she met while at Manchester School of Theatre. They divorced in 1982. She married professional photographer Sven Arnstein in 1989, and the couple had two daughters before divorcing in 2004. Burton currently lives in Hastings, East Sussex (in 2016).

==Charity==
Burton is an ambassador for The Children&#x27;s Trust, a UK charity for children with brain injury and neurodisability.

<text>Chiayi (, Taigi POJ: &quot;Ka-gī&quot;; ), officially known as Chiayi City, is a city located in Chianan Plain in southwestern Taiwan, surrounded by Chiayi County with a population of 263,188 inhabitants as of January 2023.

The Hoanya people inhabited present-day Chiayi under its historical name of &quot;Tirosen&quot; prior to the arrival of Han Chinese in Taiwan and was ruled by the Dutch and the Kingdom of Tungning under various names. During the Qing dynasty, Tirosen was governed as part of Taiwan Prefecture in Fujian under Zhuluo County and the city was renamed Kagee in 1787. The city was renamed &quot;Kagi&quot; during the Japanese era but an earthquake in 1906 destroyed much of the town. Kagi was administered as part of Tainan Prefecture from 1920 onwards. Following the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Republic of China, who deposed the Qing in 1911, took control of the city (renamed Chiayi City) and administered it as a provincial city of Taiwan Province before being integrated into Chiayi County in 1950 as a county-administered city. The city was restored to its status as a provincial city in 1982. In 1998, Taiwan Province was streamlined and Chiayi City has been governed directly since then by the Executive Yuan.

The city is known for Alishan National Scenic Area and warm humid subtropical climate in the summer months. Left with the landmarks of Japanese colonial rule, Chiayi City has the round-island railway system and Alishan Forest Railway where the city is the starting point along with various Japanese temples.

==Name==
Like the county, Chiayi City&#x27;s former Chinese placename was Tsu-lo-san (), a representation of the original Formosan-language name &quot;Tirosen&quot;. A shortened version, Tsulo, was then used to name Tsulo County, which originally covered the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of the island. In 1704, the county seat was moved to Tsulosan, the site of modern-day Chiayi City. Following the 1723 Zhu Yigui rebellion, the county was reduced in size. In 1787, the county and city were renamed &quot;Chiayi&quot; (; ) by the Qianlong Emperor to acknowledge the citizens&#x27; loyalty during the Lin Shuangwen rebellion.

==History==
===Early history===
First inhabited by the Hoanya aborigines, the region was named Tirosen (variants &quot;Tirocen&quot;, &quot;Tiracen&quot;). With the arrival of Han Chinese immigrants in southwestern Taiwan, the name evolved to become &quot;Tsulosan&quot; () in Hokkien. Eventually, Tsulosan was shortened to simply Tsulo. Because of the choice of the characters, it has been mistakenly suggested that the origin of the name came from the expression &quot;mountains surrounding the east&quot;. &quot;Peach City&quot; is another name for Chiayi City due to its peach-shaped territory in ancient times. The tip of the peach is around Central Fountain and was called &quot;Peach-tip&quot; by citizens.

Tsulosan was once the foothold to which people from the mainland immigrated. In 1621, , who came from Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, first led his people to cultivate this land after they landed at &quot;Ponkan&quot; (modern-day Beigang).

===Dutch Formosa===
Records from the Dutch era, beginning in 1624, show Tirosen as the usual form of the name; it also occurred as &quot;Tirassen&quot;, &quot;Tirozen&quot;, &quot;Tilocen&quot;, &quot;Tilossen&quot;, &quot;Tilocen&quot;, and &quot;Thilocen&quot;. The place was north of Mattau (modern-day Madou, Tainan) and south of Favorlang (Huwei, Yunlin).

===Kingdom of Tungning===
In 1661 (the 15th year of Yung-Li, Ming dynasty), Koxinga defeated the Dutch based in Taiwan and founded the Kingdom of Tungning. He established one province, , and two counties, and , demarcated by the Hsin-Kang River (, now the Yanshui River). Chiayi was under the jurisdiction of the Tien-Hsing County.

===Qing dynasty===
In 1683, when Qing rule began, the island was governed as Taiwan Prefecture under the administration of Fujian Province. In 1684, Tsulo County was established and initially encompassed the underdeveloped northern two-thirds of Taiwan. (Taiwan and Hongsoa counties were divided from Wan-Nien County during the Kingdom of Tungning, which was changed from Tien-Hsing County.) In 1704, the county seat was moved to Tsulosan, the site of modern-day Chiayi City, and had wooden city walls.

In 1727, the county magistrate, Liu Liang-Bi rebuilt the gatehouses and set a gun platform for each gatehouse. The four gatehouses were named: &quot;Chin Shan&quot; () for East, &quot;Tai Hai&quot; () for West, &quot;Chung Yang&quot; () for South, and &quot;Kung Chen&quot; () for North. In 1734 (the 12th year of Yongzheng), magistrate Lu-Hung built piercing-bamboo to better protect the city.

In 1786, the Lin Shuangwen rebellion was an attempt to siege Tsulosan but failed to overcome the defense of the inhabitants. Consequently, on November 3 of the next year, the Qing Emperor conferred the name Kagee (; ) to praise the citizens&#x27; loyalty.

In the mid-1800s, a custom of annual riotous mass stoning developed in the city.

In 1887, a separate Taiwan Province was declared and the island was administratively divided into four prefectures; the city of Kagee belonged to Tainan Prefecture.

===Japanese rule===

In 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The 1906 Meishan earthquake devastated the entire city wall except the Eastern Gate. The Japanese authorities reconstructed the city. Industries and trades started to flourish. According to the census taken in 1904, Kagi was the fourth most populous city in Taiwan, with a population of over twenty thousand.

The Great Kagi earthquake (later also known as the 1906 Meishan earthquake) struck the city in mid March 1906.

In 1907, the construction of Alishan Forest Railway to Mount Ali was begun. In 1920, the city became an autonomous group as , Kagi District, within Tainan Prefecture, which included modern-day Tainan City, Chiayi County and Yunlin County. In 1930, the town was upgraded to an autonomous city under the same prefecture.

===Republic of China===

After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in October 1945, Chiayi City was established as a provincial city of Taiwan Province. The city consisted of 8 districts, which were Bajiang, Beimen, Beizhen, Nanmen, Tungmen, Tungshan, Ximen and Zhuwei Districts. In 1946, the districts was reorganized to 6 districts in which Bajiang and Nanmen were merged to become Xinnan, Beimen and Beizhen were merged to become Xinbei, Tungmen and Tungshan were merged to become Xindong, Ximen and Zhuwei were merged to become Xinxi District and there were 2 addition of districts from Tainan County which were Shuishang and Taibao Districts.

Chiayi saw some of the most violent events during the 228 Incident. In early March, local militas surrounded the Shueishang Airport and fought against the KMT military. There were over 300 casualties. On 12 March 1947, negotiators for peace, including Tan Teng-pho and , were arrested after arriving at the airport and were executed on 25 March. The Kuomintang also executed many civilians in Chiayi.

On 16 August 1950, because of the re-allocation of administrative areas in which Taiwan was divided into 16 counties, five provincial cities and a special bureau, Chiayi City was downgraded to a county-administered city and merged with Chiayi County to be the county seat. As a result, a shortage of capital hindered its development.

On 1 July 1982, Chiayi City was elevated again to a provincial city as a result of pressure from local elites. On 6 October 1990, the East District and West District were established.

==Geography==
Chiayi City is located on the north side of Chianan Plain, south west of Taiwan Island. On the east side is the Mount Ali, on the west side is the Chiayi Airport, on the north side is the Puzi River and on the south side is the Bazhang River. The distance from east to west of Chiayi City is and from north to south is with a total area of . Chiayi City is completely surrounded by Chiayi County. Most of Chiayi City land is broad flat fertile plains. The terrain slowly rises from west to east. Chiayi is also one of the closest Taiwanese cities to the Tropic of Cancer, with the latitudinal line lying just south of the city.

===Climate===
Chiayi City has a warm humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cwa&quot;) that closely borders a true tropical climate. Northeasterly winds during fall and winter mean that rainfall is depressed during that time, while southwesterly winds during summer and the later portion of spring bring most of the year&#x27;s rainfall, with more than 60% falling from June to August. Humidity is high year-round, even during winter.

==Government==

Chiayi City is a provincial city of Taiwan Province of the Republic of China. The city is governed by the Chiayi City Government, while the residence is represented in the Chiayi City Council. The current Mayor of Chiayi City is Huang Min-hui of the Kuomintang.

===Administrative divisions===
Chiayi City is divided into two districts. East District is the city seat which houses the Chiayi City Government.

===Politics===

Chiayi City voted one Democratic Progressive Party legislator to be in the Legislative Yuan during the 2020 Taiwanese legislative election. It has historically been a very pan-Green city. During the martial law era, most people of Chiayi supported tangwai politicians. However, the voting gap between the DPP and the KMT has narrowed in recent years. In the 2022 Taiwanese local elections, Chiayi City re-elected Huang Min-hui of Kuomintang to be the mayor.

<text>Mathias Brugman (birth name: Mathias Brugman Duliebre) (January 3, 1811 – September 30, 1868), a.k.a. Mathias Bruckman, was a leader in Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence revolution against Spain known as El Grito de Lares (English: &quot;The Cry of Lares&quot;).

==Early years==
Brugman&#x27;s father was Pierre Brugman from Curaçao of Dutch–Jewish Sephardic ancestry and his mother, Isabel Duliebre from Puerto Rico. They met and married in New Orleans, Louisiana where Brugman was born, raised and educated.

The Brugman family moved to Puerto Rico and settled in the City of Mayagüez where Mathias met and married Ana Maria Laborde. He opened a &quot;colmado&quot; (grocery store) and became rather successful, only to lose a good part of his fortune attempting to grow coffee. Like many other residents of Puerto Rico at the time, he resented the political injustices practiced by Spain on the island. This led him to become a believer in the cause of the Puerto Rican independence movement.

==Independence advocate==
Brugman admired independence advocates Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis. It was this admiration which inspired him to become an outspoken advocate for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence.

In his Colmado, people would normally gather on a daily basis to discuss politics. Brugman eventually befriended Manuel Rojas and his brother Miguel and together with his son, Hector joined them in a conspiracy to revolt against Spain. Together, with a group of other patriots, they formed revolutionary committees. These committees were mainly based on the west coast towns of Puerto Rico. The first revolutionary committee formed was Mathias Brugman&#x27;s in Mayagüez. He used his Colmado as his headquarters and his cell was code named: &quot;Capa Prieta&quot; (Black Cape). Manuel Rojas committee in Lares was code named &quot;Centro Bravo&quot; (Bravo Center).

==El Grito de Lares==
On September 23, 1868, the revolution began and the town of Lares was taken in what was to be known as El &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; (English: &quot;Cry of Lares&quot;). The revolutionists declared Puerto Rico to be the free &quot;Republic of Puerto Rico&quot;. However, the Spanish were already forewarned and soon defeated the small Army of liberators.

Mathias Brugman, his son Hector and Baldomero Baurer (a fellow revolutionist) went into hiding. Many of the others were either killed or imprisoned, including Manuel Rojas and Mariana Bracetti. On September 30, 1868, a farm worker, Francisco Quiñones, who worked in the Asunción Plantation, betrayed Brugman, his son and Baurer and led the Spanish authorities to where they were hiding. The men refused to surrender and eventually were executed. Mathias Brugman died in the town of Yauco, Puerto Rico in 1868.

<text>David Anthony Gerald Sumberg (born 2 June 1941) is a British politician, and former Member of the European Parliament for the North West England region for the Conservative Party. He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999 and stood down in 2009. Before this he was the Member of Parliament for Bury South, north of Manchester, from 1983 to 1997 when he lost in the Labour landslide to Ivan Lewis.

==Political life==
Prior to his election to Westminster, he stood unsuccessfully for Manchester Wythenshawe in 1979, being beaten by Labour&#x27;s Alf Morris. He had also been a Manchester City Councillor for Brooklands ward in Wythenshawe. As an MP he acted as the Parliamentary Private Secretary for the Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew. He seconded the Loyal Humble Address of Ian Gow MP in November 1989; a privilege that was traditionally afforded only once to an MP. He held on to his seat in 1992 with a majority of 788 votes over Labour&#x27;s Hazel Blears, making Bury South one of the most marginal in the country.

He has been criticised by members of other political parties and the national media for his low attendance and political inactivity in the European Parliament. He tabled only five questions and has not written any of the reports or tabled any resolutions to the one committee he sat on. When he stepped down from the European Parliament, he explained that as an MEP, he was &quot;not a signed up member&quot; of the &quot;European Project&quot; and did not support a more centralised European Union, &quot;unlike most of my MEP colleagues&quot;.

He paid his wife £54,000 per year from the staff allowance and claimed £40,000 per year in office expenses; he used the North West England Conservative Campaigns Centre as a forwarding address to his house in north London, where he claimed the expenses.

==Personal life==
He is married to Carolyn and has two children. In the 1970s he was a partner in a firm of Manchester lawyers Maurice Rubin &amp; Co.

<doc id="724089" wikidata="Q4922866" url="?curid=724089" title="Blackfeet music">
<text>Blackfoot music is the music of the Blackfoot people (best translated in the Blackfoot language as &quot;nitsínihki&quot; – &quot;I sing&quot;, from &quot;nínihksini&quot; – &quot;song&quot;). Singing predominates and was accompanied only by percussion.

Ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl proposes that Blackfoot music is an &quot;emblem of the heroic and the difficult in Blackfoot life&quot;, with performance practices that strongly distinguish music from the rest of life. Singing is strongly distinguished from speech and many songs contain no words, and those with texts often describe important parts of myths in a succinct manner. Music is associated closely with warfare and most singing is done by men and much by community leaders. &quot;The acquisition of songs as associated with difficult feats—learned in visions brought about through self-denial and torture, required to be learned quickly, sung with the expenditure of great energy, sung in a difficult vocal style—all of this puts songs in the category of the heroic and the difficult.&quot;

==Instrumentation==

Blackfoot music is primarily vocal, using few instruments (called &quot;ninihkiátsis&quot;, derived from the word for song and associated primarily with European-American instruments), only percussion and voice, and few words. By far the most important percussion instruments are drums (&quot;isttókimaa’tsis&quot;), with rattles (&quot;awanáá&quot;) and bells often being associated with the objects, such as sticks or dancers legs, they are attached to rather than as instruments of their own.

===Singing===
Singing consists mostly of vocables, though recordings and reports from the early 1900s and prior indicate there were a great deal more lyrics or vocal texts. Blackfoot people see the profusion of words in European American music and African American music as lessening the importance and meaning of both words and music; and the same for the manner of listening to such music, that is, for entertainment or enjoyment, often while doing other things: if someone needed to say so many words, why didn&#x27;t they just talk. Blackfoot music is not based on instruments or texts, and singing is not supposed to sound like talking (or imitate any other sound). Typically, songs which contain texts are short and not repetitive, such as: &quot;It&#x27;s a bad thing to be an old man&quot;, 1951 recording of a Crazy Dog Society song) or the relatively lengthy, &quot;Yonder woman, you must take me. I am powerful. Yonder woman, you must take me, you must hear me. Where I sit is powerful&quot; (Wissler and Duvall 1909:85 sung by a rock to a woman in the buffalo-rock myth). Often when the text takes up most of the melody with fewer vocables the melodies are short. The vocables used, as in Plains Indigenous singing, are the consonants &quot;h&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, and vowels. They avoid &quot;n&quot;, &quot;c&quot; (&quot;ts&quot;) and other consonants. &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; tend slightly to be higher in pitch, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot; lower.


Solo singing may have been more prominent, or the norm, in the past, but group singing has increased in prominence, with singing/drumming groups called &quot;drums&quot;. Vocal blending is not required in ensemble singing. The leader may begin the head motive or phrase of a song, and then be repeated or &quot;raised&quot; by another singer, possibly the second singer. In pan-Indigenous powwow terminology, stanzas to a song are often called &quot;push-ups&quot;.

====Vocal style====
The vocal style is similar to other Plains Indigenous nations with: &quot;high-pitched beginnings, pulsations, vocal narrowness. [and] nasality.&quot; &quot;Pulsations on longer tones, the audible effects of tension, nasality, substantial rasp, and some ornamentation are characteristic.&quot; Though this may have become &quot;exaggerated&quot; through influence from Plains Indigenous music and pan-Indigenous music, Blackfoot singing is &quot;more intense and uses a higher tessitura&quot;, than most Plains Indigenous music. From comparison of recordings one would agree with older consultants in the latter 1900s: &quot;These younger fellows, they sing higher and louder than we used to.&quot;. Experimentation with European influenced instrumentation and harmony happen but are rare, and the vocal style is the element least tampered with it being considered essential to sound like traditional Indigenous music.. Though the European influenced concept of meter may be inapplicable to Blackfoot music as it is characterized by the relationships between phrases usually of irregular length, the beat level generally equals the rate at which vocal pulsations occur.

===Drumming===
Singing without drums is extremely rare and considered inappropriate. The drum accompaniment to songs is rhythmically independent to the singing but in perfect unison, &quot;slightly off the beat&quot;, and &quot;often related roughly by the proportion of 2:3&quot;, to the vocal pulse or beat level (though see Pantaleoni, 1987). Another change in Blackfoot music is increased relatedness of the drum part to the song now than in the past. Often drumming over repeated sections that comprise a song begins with players softly striking the rim of the bass drum. The tempo increases as the drumming moves further to the center of the drum skin. At some point &quot;hard beats&quot;, loud strokes off the rhythm by an individual, sometimes the leader, and beats may be omitted. Drumming may pause for a phrase or two in the last stanza of the last repetition and finish loudly. When playing the stick game, players drum upon a plank, and the drumming is more likely to coincide with vocal beats, but less accurate unison playing. Rattles are no longer used.

Drumming has increased in prominence since 1900, now being virtually required, possibly because of the influence of pan-tribal culture, the decreased use of rattles and other percussion, or the decrease in frequency of songs texts. The use of the term &quot;drumming&quot; for musician/singer also increased between the 1960s and the 1980s.

== Song composition ==
Traditionally, songs are considered to be given, completed, to individual Blackfoot people in visions or dreams. Though it is now accepted that music, especially white music, may be composed in the European influenced sense, the traditional view still greatly affects how songs and their creation or origin are considered. Songs are considered somewhat like objects, in that they may be created of components, but once finished become a unity. They may also be &quot;given&quot; or even sold. Some songs belong to everyone, some songs to just one person but may be sung by others, and some songs individuals save until times of great need. Two songs which may be aurally identical may be considered different songs if they have different origins, i.e., came from different visions.

Most songs, except gambling songs which simply repeat &quot;litany-like&quot; one or two phrases, are characterized by an &quot;incomplete repetition&quot; formal pattern, &quot;many of them can ultimately be reduced to a binary form in which the section is a variation and/or reduction of the first.&quot;. However, there was more formal variation in the past. Songs sung with medicine basket openings and gamblings songs often use isometric and isorhythmic rhythmic structures or lesser note-length values. Typically songs begin in falsetto before singers move to their head voices. Octave equivalence appears to be used, as transposition down by an octave of subsequent repetitions of a section is common, though may also occur down a perfect fourth or perfect fifth. Songs begin with a &quot;head motif&quot; repeated by the second singer and then used to &quot;generate&quot; the rest of the song in ways which are fairly predictable to Blackfoot listeners, which facilitates accomplishing the ideal of learning songs in one hearing.

== Genres and repertoire ==
Children do not have their own song or game song repertoire, except for Mice Songs associated with one game, and songs usually called lullabies sung to them by their mothers. Women used to have their own small repertoire of lullabies, laments, and other songs, but these have been largely lost. Two-Spirit &quot;manly-hearted women&quot; (Lewis, 1941) who act in much of the social roles of men, were in the past also willing to sing alone and use a men&#x27;s singing style.

==Musical thought==
The basic musical unit in Blackfoot music is the song, and musicians, people who sing and drum, are called singers or drummers with both words being equivalent and referring to both activities. Women, though increasingly equal participants, are not called &quot;singers&quot; or &quot;drummers&quot; and it is considered somewhat inappropriate for women to sing loudly or alone. &quot;Páskani&quot; – &quot;dance&quot; or &quot;ceremony&quot; – often implicitly includes music and is often applied to ceremonies with little dancing and much singing.

Blackfoot musical thought is also more enumerative than European influenced musical thought which tends to be more hierarchical. Songs are differentiated primarily by use: in ceremonies, often associated with specific Naruto (especially in medicine bundles), concepts, dances, or actions, or during gambling (hand game), or other uses. Songs are differentiated secondarily by association with a person, and thirdly and less commonly by association with a story or event. There are no types of music which are considered more or less music or musical, such as in Iranian musical thought.

Music, singing, is not thought to be like speech, or any other sound at all. There are no spoken introductions or conclusions and no &quot;intermediary forms&quot; between speech and singing.

Rehearsing happens increasingly, likely because of the influence of European influenced concepts of performance, song origin or composition, and a change in the purpose of music: from communication with the supernatural to communication with other humans.

== Ethnography ==
As the Blackfoot are one of the most studied American Indigenous groups there are many collections of Blackfoot music, the largest being at the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University. Historical comparisons may be made as the earliest recordings of Blackfoot music were done on wax cylinders. The first recordings, by George Bird Grinnell in 1897, are of James White Calf or others singing around forty songs in or around the Blackfoot Nation. The second set of recordings, by Clark Wissler in 1903 and 1904 contains 146 cylinders, part of his larger studies and the third, by J.K. Dixon of the Wanamaker Expedition No. 2 in 1909, includes several songs sung mostly by Chief Bull at the Crow Agency. The next big collection, by Jane Richardson Hanks accompanied by husband Lucien Hanks in 1938, was recorded in Gleichen, Alberta among the Canadian Blackfoot and featured Spumiapi (&quot;White-Headed Chief&quot;). After the invention of the tape recorder thousands of songs where recorded by Indigenous persons, ethnomusicologists, hobbyists and students, and record companies.

Though these recordings are countless there are chronological gaps (1910–1950), complex music and culture changed rapidly, and the various groups are treated unevenly. Additionally there are few studies of the musical culture (most recordings being made as part of ethnographic studies), mostly by Bruno Nettl.

Public interest in Blackfoot music is indicated by the release of two records (17611 and 17635), recorded unexplainably in New York in 1914. Beginning in the 1950s professional singing groups were formed.

<text>Irvine High School is a public high school, located in the city of Irvine in Orange County, California, United States. It is part of the Irvine Unified School District. The school is located in the El Camino Real neighborhood in the north-central part of the city.

As of the 2014–15 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,968 students and 60 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student-teacher ratio of 30.7.

==Awards and recognition==
During the 1988–89 school year, Irvine High School was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive.

It was named a California Distinguished School by the California State Board of Education in both 1988 and 2007.

Additionally, in 2000 and again in 2006, the Accrediting Commission for the Western Association of Schools and Colleges awarded Irvine High a full six-year term of accreditation under the Pursuing Excellence format.

Irvine High School has also been named a Grammy “Signature Gold” for its instrumental and choral music departments.

The High School provided facilities for the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in August 2010.

==History==
Soon after it opened in 1970, University High School, the first high school in Irvine, began to get too crowded from the influx of residents moving to Irvine&#x27;s fast-developing housing tracts. The school district had already planned for a second high school to be built on what was then the extreme north side of the city across Walnut Avenue from the Greentree residential tract which was completed in 1973. Dr. Dean Waldfogel was chosen to be the first principal of Irvine High School; Waldfogel selected his faculty of a dozen teachers from a large number of applicants. The fledgling organization accepted its first class of 300 freshmen in September 1975. Because the high school&#x27;s buildings were still under construction and not ready for occupation, the new high school was housed in extra classrooms and portable buildings at Rancho San Joaquin Middle School, sharing facilities such as sports, music and the library with the younger students there. The new Irvine High School campus opened its doors in September 1976, taking in as sophomores the former class of &quot;Rancho&quot; ninth graders as well as a new class of freshmen. Each successive year added another class of freshmen and in September, 1978, the high school finally had all four classes of students. Construction continued on campus during this time, with the theater and the main gym becoming available in 1977, the football-track field in 1978 and the aquatic center in 1979. The first class graduated in June, 1979.
The campus itself is notable for its architecture. It was designed by architect Ron D. Young in the Brutalist architecture style, and built largely of tilt up concrete slabs featuring distinctive cast geometric inlays. The shapes and angles of floor plans and design motifs were based on the hexagon. The initial layout of the Humanities building envisioned two or three teachers and their respective students sharing a single open plan hexagonal room, but this quickly proved too distracting. Portable office dividers were placed in a line to define classroom boundaries, but noise was still a problem. After two years of such conditions, walls were erected to close off the large, open hexagons.

Irvine High School&#x27;s alma mater is inspired by Jean Sibelius&#x27;s composition Finlandia and arranged by Eugene Davis, a member of the class of 1980.

==Academic teams==

Irvine High has several distinguished academic teams. The Science Olympiad team placed first in Orange County and third in California in the 1986-1987 Science Olympiad competitions, and second in Orange County and fourth in Southern California in the 2010–2011 Science Olympiad competitions. In the American Chemical Society National Chemistry Olympiad, Irvine High School students qualified as national finalists by placing in the top twenty of the nation in 1986 (You Chun Yang), 1991 (Navin Jani), and 1992 (Ashish Kalthia), sending them to the U.S. Air Force Academy Study Camp to prepare for competition in the International Chemistry Olympiad.  At the time, Irvine High School was the only high school in the nation to have had three different students qualify as finalists. The Quiz Bowl team, begun in the 2010–2011 school year, informally ranked in the top 15 schools in Southern California that season. It tied for second in the regular division of the Triton Spring Quiz Bowl Competition. In the 2011–12 season, the Irvine Team placed sixth place at the UCSD Triton Fall Tournament, qualifying them for the 2012 PACE NSC Quiz Bowl Tournament in St. Louis. Irvine&#x27;s newspaper, the El Vaquero, is regarded as the best high school newspaper publication in the nation, having won the first place prize in 2014.Irvine High School is also a founding high school in the Irvine CubeSat STEM Program, and is in charge of developing and working on microsatellite propulsion methods.

<text>Terence Wynn (born 27 June 1946) is a former British politician who served in the European Parliament.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Wigan, Wynn was educated at Leigh College, Riversdale College, Liverpool Polytechnic and Salford University. He became a marine engineer, with a Combined Chief Engineer&#x27;s Certificate and later obtained a Master of Science Degree.

== Career ==
He was a Member of the European Parliament; he held the European Constituency of Merseyside East from 1989 to 1994, Merseyside East and Wigan from 1994 to 1999, and from 1999 until 2006 represented the North West counties of England with a 7 million population, one of the 3 Labour Party Members out of a total of 9 MEPs for the region under a proportional voting system.

From 1999 to 2004 he held the position of President of the Budget Committee in the European Parliament, which oversaw the, then, €110bn budget of the EU.  In this role he was Head of Parliament delegations when negotiating the budget with the Finance Ministers of the 25 Member States which occurred several times each financial year.  Responsible also for Parliamentary reports on the future financing of the EU.

He was vice-chairman to the president of the European Parliament (therefore de facto chairman) of the Parliament&#x27;s temporary committee on &quot;Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Enlarged Union from 2007-2013&quot;.

He also co-chaired the committee of inquiry into allegations of misuse of EU funds by the Palestinian Authority.

Prior to being president of the committee, he was the majority leader (i.e. co-ordinator) for his political group for 5 years.  Before that he had been general Budget Rapporteur (i.e. the immember responsible for setting out Parliament&#x27;s position on the budget – the lead player) for two consecutive budgets.

His special interests included reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, (he was chairman of an all-party, cross nationality grouping of MEPs which campaigned for agriculture reform), Development Aid, where he had a specific interest in South Africa and has written a Parliamentary Report on the funding of the EU Special Programme during the apartheid years.

He strongly advocated the case for nuclear power and chaired the Forum for the Future of Nuclear Energy within the European Parliament.  On this subject he was invited to speak at various European gatherings, visited nuclear installations in the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Sweden, and has been a keynote speaker at a conference in Tokyo and given public lectures in Dunedin and Christchurch, New Zealand on &quot;Nuclear Energy for a Green Future&quot;. 

He also led a delegation to Bulgaria and was instrumental in raising the issue of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in the EU.

Since Australia and New Zealand are part of the Cairns Group, campaigning for agriculture reform within the WTO, he was a vice-president of the Parliamentary delegation to these countries.  He was the inaugural speaker at the Jean Monet lecture at the university in Christchurch, (followed the next year by Prime Minister Helen Clarke).  He has addressed civil servants and politicians in Canberra and Wellington as well as Pretoria and Cape Town on European matters. In November 2006 he gave a public seminar at the Australian National University in Canberra. In March/April 2007 he was &quot;European in Residence&quot; for the EU Centres Network of New Zealand, visiting and speaking at the universities of Auckland, Waikato, Victoria University Wellington, Canterbury and Otago.

<text>Arlene McCarthy OBE (born 10 October 1960, Belfast, Northern Ireland) was a Member of the European Parliament for the Peak District (European Parliament constituency) from 1994 to 1999 and for North West England from 1999 to 2014, in both cases for the Labour Party.

==Career before politics==
McCarthy graduated from South Bank Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) in 1983 with BA (Hons) proceeding to attend the Free University of Berlin and then later attending the University of Manchester to conduct PhD studies.

After completing studies McCarthy was employed as a lecturer in International Politics and Regional Studies at the Free University of Berlin, and was also employed at the European Parliament working for the Labour MEP Glyn Ford.

Upon returning to Britain McCarthy worked as the Principal European Liaison Officer at Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council, until her election to the European Parliament.

==European Parliament==
First elected in 1994, McCarthy was re-elected in 1999 to represent the newly formed North West England constituency. Having represented the same constituency since, she was top of the list of candidates from the Labour Party at the 2009 European elections.

McCarthy held a number of positions within Parliament. As the Labour Party was a member of the Party of European Socialists, she sat in the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats parliamentary group. McCarthy was Chair of the Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and, later, vice-chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.

In January 2014 McCarthy announced she would not be seeking re-election in the June 2014 European Parliament Election.

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours.

<doc id="724124" wikidata="Q2627991" url="?curid=724124" title="Blue Öyster Cult (album)">
<text>Blue Öyster Cult is the debut studio album by the American rock band Blue Öyster Cult, released in 1972 by Columbia Records. The album featured songs such as &quot;Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot;, and &quot;Then Came the Last Days of May&quot;, all of which the band still plays regularly during its concerts. Despite positive reviews, the album failed to chart for some time before finally cracking the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on May 20, 1972, peaking at No. 172. Blue Öyster Cult toured with artists such as the Byrds, Alice Cooper and the Mahavishnu Orchestra to support the album.

==Recording==
Joe Bouchard reflected on the album&#x27;s creation in 2022:I couldn&#x27;t believe how much fun I was having. Every day I&#x27;d get up and we&#x27;d be going to the studio, and I&#x27;d be like, &#x27;I can&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re going to a studio to make an album…a real album, on Columbia Records!&#x27; So, I was excited every day. And I was learning how records are made – this was at David Lucas&#x27; jingle studio in New York. On eight tracks. That&#x27;s all you had – you had to do the whole album on eight tracks. But he would show us little magical ways of doubling things and doing live bounces. They&#x27;d be flipping the tape over backwards and he&#x27;d be making flanging using duplication of the part. So, he was all into what was happening with the Beatles and that production. And of course, Sandy Pearlman and Murray Krugman produced that record – so they kept us conceptually...instead of going way off track, they wanted to establish what was going to become Blue Öyster Cult. It had to have that vibe. When it came out, I was a little disappointed – I didn&#x27;t like the vinyl pressing. But then maybe about 15 years later, they put it out on CD, and then all of a sudden, it brought me back to the studio. It was cleaner, and it was like sitting in the control room, listening to the playback of the mixes. I think we were all tremendously excited to be working on that record. And it sounds like it.

== Track information ==

===Transmaniacon MC===
&quot;Transmaniacon MC&quot; is about the Altamont Free Concert. The &quot;MC&quot; in the title stands for &quot;motorcycle club&quot;.

===I&#x27;m on the Lamb but I Ain&#x27;t No Sheep===
&quot;I&#x27;m on the Lamb but I Ain&#x27;t No Sheep&quot; is about a fugitive pursued by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and was originally recorded in 1970 (when the band was known as &quot;Oaxaca&quot;). Another version from 1970 was intended to be included on the band&#x27;s unreleased first album for Elektra Records (when the band was known as &quot;Stalk-Forrest Group&quot;). Both of these 1970 versions were eventually included on &quot;St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings&quot;. In 1971, the song was recorded again and finally released on the first Columbia album, and then recorded again at a much faster tempo and with much heavier guitars as &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; and included on the band&#x27;s second Columbia album, &quot;Tyranny and Mutation&quot;. The main riff in this song was heavily inspired by &quot;Frying Pan&quot;, a Captain Beefheart b-side from 1966. Some versions of the song make this influence more apparent than others.

===Then Came the Last Days of May===
&quot;Then Came the Last Days of May&quot; is based on a reportedly true story, when two friends of Dharma&#x27;s were killed in a drug deal gone bad in the West:It was still in the Soft White Underbelly days when we were playing dances at Stony Brook University [on Long Island] for our sustenance money. Three Stony Brook students went to Tucson, Arizona, to buy some bulk marijuana for resale. I don&#x27;t know how they got whatever contact they had, but it was two brothers – scions from one of the better-to-do families in Tucson. They never intended to sell them any pot. They just wanted to rip &#x27;em off and shoot &#x27;em, which they did. They took them out to the desert and shot them. It was three guys, and one managed to survive and get back to the highway ... I wrote the story from basically the newspaper accounts of the Long Island newspaper, &quot;Newsday ...&quot; There&#x27;s a personal connection, too. I knew one of the guys casually from Stony Brook University when we were hanging out there. This song is frequently played live as a showcase for Buck Dharma&#x27;s guitar soloing skills.

===Before the Kiss, a Redcap===
Originally titled &quot;Conry&#x27;s Bar&quot;, &quot;Before the Kiss, a Redcap&quot; describes scenes from that real location. Guitarist Buck Dharma explains the title as originating in an event witnessed by lyricist/manager Sandy Pearlman in which the titular drug was passed between partners during a kiss. The term &quot;redcap&quot; was supposedly slang for a type of barbiturate; however, &quot;redcap&quot; usually referred to the drug Dalmane.

===Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll===

&quot;Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll&quot; was written by Sandy Pearlman, Donald Roeser and Albert Bouchard, and released as a single. Bouchard performed lead vocals, also singing from his drum kit in concerts. The riff was inspired by Black Sabbath&#x27;s song &quot;The Wizard,&quot; featured on their own self-titled debut album. It remains a staple of Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s live shows. On live albums, the name of the song is shortened to &quot;Cities on Flame.&quot;

===Redeemed===
The lyrics were written by singer-songwriter Harry Farcas, and sold to the band. &quot;Sir Rastus Bear&quot; was Farcas&#x27; pet Saint Bernard.

== Reception ==
The album received a positive reaction from critics. Lester Bangs gave the album a generally positive review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stating, &quot;with the Blue Öyster Cult, New York has produced its first authentic boogie beast, and with any luck this one should be around for awhile&quot; telling readers that &quot;I don&#x27;t think you should miss this album.&quot; &quot;Circus&quot; wrote that &quot;it could well be the album of the Seventies&quot;, while Robert Christgau in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;the tightest and most musical hard rock record since – dare I say it? – &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;&quot;. The record was named an honorable mention on IGN&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 25 Metal Albums&quot; and has been called &quot;heavy metal for people who hate heavy metal.&quot; Canadian critic Martin Popoff criticized the &quot;limp and lifeless&quot; guitar sound and the unimpressive percussive display, which did not make a good service to the &quot;tragic and beautiful BÖC compositions&quot; on the album, leaving the listener &quot;in muted bewilderment&quot;.

== Covers and appearances ==
A cover version of &quot;Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll&quot; has been covered by Church of Misery (on &quot;Master of Brutality&quot;), Iced Earth (on &quot;Tribute to the Gods&quot;) and 3 Inches of Blood (as a bonus track on &quot;Here Waits Thy Doom&quot;). The song appears in the American television period sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, as well as its soundtrack.

Guitarist William Tyler performs a 2015 solo acoustic instrumental version of &quot;She&#x27;s as Beautiful as a Foot&quot; on &quot;Aquarium Drunkard&quot;″s &quot;Lagniappe Sessions&quot; page.

<text>Rodger Bumpass (born November 20, 1951) is an American actor. He is known for his role as Squidward Tentacles on the American animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. He voices several other characters on the show as well, including the purple doctor fish and various anchovies.

He also voiced The Chief in the animated series &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, Professor Membrane from &quot;Invader Zim&quot; and Mr. Besser, the school principal in the animated series &quot;The Kids from Room 402&quot;. Bumpass has many other credits in animated films, animated television series, and video games.

==Early life==
Rodger Bumpass was born on November 20, 1951, in Little Rock, Arkansas, to Carroll C. (1924–2009) and Virginia Cathey Bumpass (1921–2004). He had two siblings, one of whom was stillborn. His parents ran a dry cleaning business. He described his mother as “the life of the family” and his father “a typical Southern male with Southern male disgust“ but added that he was loving and giving. As a child, Bumpass idolized Mel Blanc and would do impressions of Looney Tunes characters as well as other cartoon characters. He memorized the comedy albums of Jonathan Winters and Bill Cosby and was inspired by Tim Conway’s physical comedy. 

Bumpass attended Little Rock Central High School, where he received his first training in theater. He then majored in radio–TV and minored in theater at Arkansas State University. He worked at the campus radio station and also at Jonesboro&#x27;s ABC affiliated television station, KAIT-TV, where he had multiple duties as announcer, film processor, cameraman, audio technician, and technical director. While at KAIT, Bumpass also wrote, produced, and performed in a late-night comedy program called &quot;Mid-Century Nonsense Festival Featuring Kumquat Theater&quot;. He graduated from A-State in 1976, and when encouraged by an A-State professor to consider professional theater, he moved to New York in June 1977.

==Career==

Bumpass has been voicing and acting in films since the 1960s and has also appeared on stage through the mid-1970s until the late 1980s. He is also known for voicing The Chief from &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, Doctor Light on &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, and Professor Membrane on &quot;Invader Zim&quot;.

In the late 1970s, Bumpass was involved with a number of National Lampoon productions. In 1977, he won a role in the National Lampoon music and comedy road show &quot;That&#x27;s Not Funny, That&#x27;s Sick&quot; and toured with them until 1978. That same year, he appeared in the National Lampoon TV special &quot;Disco Beaver from Outer Space&quot; for HBO. In 1979, Bumpass was cast as the leading role in a National Lampoon film to be called &quot;Jaws 3, People 0&quot; in which he would have a love scene with Bo Derek. However, the film was canceled due to objections by the creators of the movie &quot;Jaws&quot;. In 1980, Bumpass created the character of &#x27;Fartman&#x27; to appear on the National Lampoon LP &quot;The White Album&quot;, which later inspired the Howard Stern character by the same name.

Bumpass is best known to present-day viewers as the voice of Squidward Tentacles and various incidental characters on the Nickelodeon animated comedy series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. 

In 2012, Bumpass received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for his role as Squidward.

==Personal life==
On July 27, 2019, Bumpass married Angela VanZandt, with whom he attended high school fifty years prior.

===Legal issues===
On January 15, 2016, Bumpass was arrested for alleged DUI in Burbank, California. A police report of the incident alleged that officers of the Burbank Police Department found Bumpass in his car in the middle of the road. He was said to have been leaning against the vehicle, and when officers approached him for questioning, he attempted to walk away and lost his balance (nearly falling to the ground). Bumpass admitted to drinking and driving after leaving a Burbank bar before the police spotted him, and he was soon handcuffed after failing a sobriety test. His blood alcohol levels were said to be more than twice the legal limit. He was later released on a $15,000 bail shortly the next morning.

The incident was first reported by celebrity gossip website TMZ several days after it occurred, on January 19. A day later, Bumpass alleged to the website that the police had lied about the DUI report, claiming that he was not leaning against his car when officers spotted him, and that he was being tailed and pulled over by the officers before his arrest, though he did confess again to the DUI charge. Nickelodeon representatives were notified of the incident by Bumpass, but did not release any immediate comments or actions regarding the matter.

On January 25, 2016, ten days after the incident, Nickelodeon representatives confirmed to TMZ that Bumpass would remain on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; for the foreseeable future. The representatives alleged that the network did not consider DUI charges to be an immoral act, and thus Bumpass was not legally subject to termination.

<doc id="724130" wikidata="Q741344" url="?curid=724130" title="Sajjad Karim">
<text>Sajjad Haider Karim (born 11 July 1970) is a British politician. He served as a Member of the European Parliament for the North West England between 2004 and 2019.
Sajjad was one of 10 members of the executive of European Movement UK and Chair of Conservative European Forum Trade.

He is a solicitor by profession and was the Legal Affairs Spokesman for the Conservatives in the European Parliament 2009 - 2019.

As well as having been a Spokesman to the WTO, Sajjad Chair&#x27;s the European Parliament&#x27;s South Asia Trade Monitoring Committee; South Caucasus Delegation and is rotating chair of the Advisory Committee on the Conduct of Members. He also serves as the vice-president of the European Parliament&#x27;s Anti-Racism &amp; Diversity Intergroup (ARDI) and as chair of its Working Group on Islamophobia.

In 2014 Karim was the European Conservatives and Reformists candidate for President of the European Parliament. He has developed extensive experience in Trade related issues including being the Parliamentary Rapporteur for an EU-India Free Trade Agreement (FTA). In 2015, he was given the highest National Honour bestowed upon foreigners by Pakistan for his role in securing a British Government lead initiative delivering favourable market access for Pakistan to the EU, known as the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP+). Through Parliament, Karim has delivered reforms which deliver exemptions for SMEs from regulation and new powers for national parliaments in EU decision-making. In 2019 he was named as Dodds Parliament Magazine winner of the International Trade Award.

On 19 August 2020, Karim tweeted his concerns at the current Government&#x27;s lack of commitment to human rights, which was misreported by some in the media.

==Early life==
Sajjad, a British Pakistani, was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, on 11 July 1970. His family hails from Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab, Pakistan.

Karim attended Walter Street County Primary School Brierfield and thereafter Mansfield High School, Brierfield. He completed his A levels at Nelson and Colne College before studying law at university. He attended the College of Law in Chester, studying law. He qualified as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales in 1997 and rose to becoming an equity partner quickly, specialising in cases of serious fraud defence work.

His earliest political activity started with leafleting at the age of seven for the then Conservative parliamentary candidate for Pendle. He later joined the Liberal Democrats in 1989. Karim was elected a member of Pendle Borough Council in 1994 and served until 2002 representing Brierfield ward.

==Member of the European Parliament, 2004–2019==
Karim was elected to represent North West England in 2004 as a Liberal Democrat. On 26 November 2007 he joined the Conservative Party and was re-elected to the European Parliament in June 2009. In May 2014 he was re-elected to serve a third term. Despite being top of the Conservative party list he was not re-elected in 2019.

He is interested in human rights issues, including child labour and the civil liberties of EU citizens in the War on Terror. He led the successful European Union contribution to the campaign for the commutation of the death penalty of British man, Mirza Tahir Hussain, who had spent half of his life on death row in Pakistan, for a crime he maintains he did not commit.

Karim has spoken out on a number of key human rights issues and in particular, campaigns for self-determination for Kashmir. He has hosted a number of conferences in the European Parliament on the issue. In 2013 he brought together Syrian opposition groups to try encourage a co-hesive strategy to the current regime. He has also been active on the issue of democracy in Egypt and civil rights in Turkey.

On 26 November 2008, whilst visiting India as part of a European Parliament Committee on International Trade delegation (ahead of an EU-India summit), he was caught in the 2008 Mumbai attacks in the lobby of the Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower hotel. Speaking to the Associated Press while holed up in the hotel&#x27;s restaurant shortly after the terrorists gained control of the hotel, Sajjad said &quot;I was in the main lobby and there was all of a sudden a lot of firing outside...all of a sudden another gunmen appeared in front of us, carrying machine gun-type weapons. And he just started firing at us... I just turned and ran in the opposite direction.&quot;

In December 2009, he was appointed as the Legal Affairs Spokesperson for the Conservative Group in the European Parliament. He was reappointed to this front bench position in June 2014 following the European Elections in May. As well as serving as a full member of the Legal Affairs Committee (JURI), Sajjad was previously a substitute member of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee and the Civil Liberties and the Justice and Home Affairs Committee. He also previously served as a member of the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries and on the Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean.

More recently as Legal Affairs Spokesperson, he has worked towards completing the Digital Single Market and Copyright Reform, which will have important and far-reaching benefits for international trade partners, consistently delivering time after time by enhancing the competitiveness of European businesses and facilitating international trade.

Karim has championed the role played by the EU in developing and facilitating international trade between the EU and the wider world, and has been involved in the development of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement within the European Parliament. He was the European Parliament&#x27;s rapporteur on the free trade agreement with India and has authored two trade-related European Parliament Reports on EU-India Trade Relations and the EU-India FTA.

Both reports maintain the need for human rights to be integral in any trade related agreement that the EU has with another country.

Karim has spent a considerable amount of his time working towards a reduction in EU regulations and red tape on businesses, particularly SMEs. In October 2011 he was appointed as the European Parliament rapporteur on a new report that will look at improving the law-making process across the EU and reducing the legislative burden.

In July 2011, the English Defence League staged an anti-Islamic protest outside his family home near Burnley, allegedly regarding new EU proposals on the labelling of halal meat. The group have targeted him despite not having much to do with either Saudi Arabia or British Bangladeshis.

In February 2012, Karim was one of five MEPs to be appointed to a panel to police the new code of conduct rules that will govern the behaviour of MEPs. He is the only British MEP to serve on this committee. The Advisory Committee provides guidance to MEPs and advises the Parliament&#x27;s president on what steps to take in the event of alleged breaches of the code. In February 2014 he was appointed chairman of the Advisory Committee by the President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz.

After the European elections in 2014, he was selected as the European Conservative and Reformist Group Parliament Presidential candidate. The incumbent Martin Schultz retained his position as president, with Karim coming second out of four candidates, widely acknowledged that he secured support from MEPs right across the house beyond his own group.

Karim made headline news in December 2012 when he played an instrumental role in securing the return of six-year-old Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson to UK from Pakistan following abduction by her father. Over several weeks he worked closely with Greater Manchester Police and the Pakistani authorities and Atiya was returned safely to her mother during the Christmas holidays.

In December 2013, the European Parliament voted to approve a concessionary trade status for Pakistan, GSP+. The preferential trade package for Pakistan&#x27;s exports to EU countries came into force in January 2014. He steered the International Trade Committee to approve the beneficial trade tariff.

From 2014 to 2019, Karim steered the European Parliament&#x27;s relations with the South Caucasus as chair of the region&#x27;s delegation, successfully contributing to the establishment of the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with Armenia and its GSP+ trading regime. He has helped finalise the negotiations on a new comprehensive agreement with Azerbaijan and has been monitoring &amp; guiding the implementation of the Association Agreement with Georgia, which includes a Deep &amp; Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement component.

Karim has been appointed as the vice-chair of ARDI and as chair of its Working group on Islamophobia. He has held multiple events within the European Parliament aimed at raising awareness of the issue of Islamophobia. In 2018, the European Parliament - as part of its 2019 election campaign - displayed a poster on the Simone Veil Agora, featuring a photo of an ordinary Muslim family, captioned with ‘We need to work together to challenge migration’. Sajjad who considered the poster islamophobic was the only MEP who personally wrote to President Tajani challenging the poster, raising the issue in Plenary and eventually compelling the President to take down the poster.

==Recognition==
Karim was awarded an Honorary Doctorate for the University of Management and Technology in Lahore for his work in securing the GSP+ deal and for services to the British Pakistani community.

In August 2014 he was awarded the Sitara-i-qaid-i-Azam, Pakistan&#x27;s highest national honour to non-Pakistanis, for his services to strengthen Pakistan/UK and Pakistan/EU relations. Sajjad was presented with the award in March 2015 by Pakistan President, Mamnoon Hussain, at a ceremony in Islamabad.

In January 2015, he was nominated for the Politician of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards.

In March 2019, Karim was the recipient of the International Trade Award at &quot;The Parliament Magazine&quot;&#x27;s annual MEP Awards.

In November 2019 Azerbaijan recognised Karims role in furthering EU-Azerbaijan relations by awarding him the Medal of Independence on the occasion of Azerbaijan&#x27;s 100 years of independence.

<doc id="724136" wikidata="Q1565644" url="?curid=724136" title="Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations">
<text>The Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations () are a Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation (band government) in Canada. They live on ten reserves along the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. The band is part of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council. There were 618 people living in the Tla-o-qui-aht reserves in 1995. Their primary economic activities are fishing and tourism.

== Introduction ==

Tla-o-qui-aht, whose ancestral border is determined by the height of land, the direction of the rivers flow and as far as the eye can see on the ocean, is a confederacy of aboriginal groups who historically were independent from one another. Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations is the Indian band mandated under the Federal &quot;Indian Act&quot; to deliver civil and human services to Tla-o-qui-aht. The hereditary governance systems and structures of Tla-o-qui-aht that exist today, and that have existed since time immemorial have a dynamic relationship with the Indian band administration and with the general population of Tla-o-qui-aht.
The Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation resides on two separate reserves, one on Meares Island (Opitsaht) and the other at Esowista, surrounded by Pacific Rim National Park. A reserve expansion is planned for the Esowista site. The Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation (TFN) has been very active in economic development.
The keystone to understanding Tla-o-qui-aht history is understanding what the term Tla-o-qui-aht means. The following translation/interpretation was developed based on conversations with various Tla-o-qui-aht elders (including Mary Hayes and Dixon Sam Mitt, among others), fluent speakers, master craftsmen, seasoned politicians and those who participated in the exhaustive community consultation that was implemented by Tla-o-qui-aht during the Meares Island court case.

Tla-o-qui-aht is the confederation of historic native groups that once lived all around the lake system called Ha-ooke-min. Tla-o-qui-aht has been translated to mean &quot;different people from a different place.&quot; However, it means much more than that: is a prefix for the term &#x27;people&#x27;, and tla-o-qui is a place in Clayoquot Sound presently known as Clayoqua. In this way Tla-o-qui-aht can be understood to mean the &quot;people from a different place.&quot; Clayoquot Sound is on the western coast of Vancouver Island, north of Tofino.

In former times, the tribe&#x27;s ancestors were in fact not one tribe, but many small tribes and family groups who lived all around Ha-ooke-min, which is now known as Kennedy Lake and which is where Tla-o-qui is located.

The defining event that changed the face of Tla-o-qui-aht forever is eternalized in the name of the Esowista Peninsula. The war of Esowista was a great war that Tla-o-qui-aht engaged in as a single force. The people who once lived on the peninsula from Long Beach to Tofino and further north had kept tight control of ocean resources and had made it a common practice to raid the sleepy fishing villages of Ha-ooke-min to take slaves and other commodities. In Nuu-chah-nulth, means &quot;clubbed to death.&quot;

Tla-o-qui-aht maintained their presence in this part of the sound through to first contact with Europeans in the late 18th century. In summary, Tla-o-qui-aht, different people, are the people from Tla-o-qui; they are a confederation of many different smaller groups who once lived a very different lifestyle at Ha-ooke-min.

== Hereditary system ==

Tla-o-qui-aht is in the process of rebuilding through a combination of restoring functions and adapting to the modern political landscape in British Columbia. The Hereditary Chiefs are leading Tla-o-qui-aht through this process.

== Administration ==

Tla-o-qui-aht maintains two administration offices, one at Opitsaht and the other on the property of Tin Wis Resort in Tofino. They are currently making plans for a new administration and cultural center for the Nation.

== Appointments to other boards ==

Currently, regionally focused appointments are made by the Hereditary Chiefs. Internal appointments to band committees etc. are made by Chief to the Clayoquot Biosphere Trust Board of Directors, the Clayoquot Sound Technical Planning Committee, the Central Region Management Board and the Central Region Board.

== Business and economic development ==

The Tla-o-qui-aht (TFN) has been very active in economic development. They own and operate TinWis Resort, and have launched a tourism-booking center owned by their Economic Development Corporation. The Nation has tourism, artist/carver and small business entrepreneurs. They are involved in expanding their community housing with a reserve expansion situated adjacent to Pacific Rim Provincial Park and they are working towards the establishment of a tribal park in the Kennedy Lake watershed that will &quot;marry&quot; economic development and environmental protection in this part of their territory. In 2008 the Nation signed a protocol with the District of Tofino to work collaboratively towards planned development on the north end of the peninsula where several large parcels of crown land are under discussion. Like several other Nations, some TFN members (six to eight) are still involved in the fishing industry including spawn-on-kelp, and commercial salmon and halibut fishing.

===Canoe Creek Hydro===
Is a run-of-river hydro plant in operation since 2010. A weir on Canoe Creek diverts water through a penstock dropping to a powerhouse with a 5.5 MW Pelton wheel generator. Water is then returned to Canoe Creek, eventually flowing into the Kennedy River. It is owned by a partnership of Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations &amp; Swiftwater Power Corp, and managed by Barkley Project Group Ltd.
The powerhouse is beside the highway at 

===Haa-ak-suuk Creek hydro===
This hydroelectric project was completed in 2014. It has a weir in Haa-ak-suuk Creek diverting water to a penstock leading to a 6 MW powerhouse at

<doc id="724141" wikidata="Q1510131" url="?curid=724141" title="Gerard Batten">
<text>Gerard Joseph Batten (born 27 March 1954) is a British politician who served as the Leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) from 2018 to 2019. He was a founding member of the party in 1993, and served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for London from 2004 to 2019.

==Early life==
Batten was born in Romford, Essex, on 27 March 1954. He grew up on the Isle of Dogs in the East End of London. Before entering politics he was employed as a salesman for British Telecom.

==Political career==
Batten was a member of the Anti-Federalist League, an early Eurosceptic cross-party political alliance from 1992 to 1993. He was one of the founding members of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in 1993, and was its first General Secretary from 1994 to 1997. He has been a member of UKIP&#x27;s National Executive Committee several times.

Batten was first elected as a Member of the European Parliament in the 2004 European Parliamentary Election for the London constituency on the basis of seeking the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

During his first term of office Batten served as a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s Subcommittee on Security and Defence (from July 2004), and was appointed as UKIP&#x27;s official spokesman on Security and Defence. In this role, he attacked the-then Labour government&#x27;s plans to introduce identity cards.

At the 2007 UKIP annual conference, he was selected as the party&#x27;s candidate to contest the 2008 London Mayoral Election, in which he received a 1.2% share of the vote.

Batten stood in the 2009 UKIP leadership election, coming second in a field of five behind the winner Lord Pearson. From 2009 to 2014, he held the office of UKIP&#x27;s Chief Whip in the European Parliament. From 2016 to 2018, Batten served as the UKIP Spokesman for Exiting the European Union.

In 2011, Batten spoke with Julian Assange&#x27;s lawyers and began advocating for him in the media and in European Parliament.

===Alexander Litvinenko and Romano Prodi===
In early April 2006, Batten stated that a London constituent and former Federal Security Service (FSB) agent, Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Litvinenko, had been told by Mario Scaramella, that Romano Prodi, the former Prime Minister of Italy and president of the European Commission, had been the KGB&#x27;s &quot;man in Italy&quot;. Batten demanded an inquiry into the allegations. He told the European Parliament that Litvinenko had been warned by FSB deputy chief General Anatoly Trofimov that there were numerous former KGB agents among Italian politicians, and that &quot;Romano Prodi is our man in Italy&quot;. The allegations were rejected by Prodi.

On 26 April 2006, Batten repeated his call for a parliamentary inquiry. He said: &quot;Former, senior members of the KGB are willing to testify in such an investigation, under the right conditions... It is not acceptable that this situation is unresolved, given the importance of Russia&#x27;s relations with the European Union.&quot; Litvinenko was admitted to hospital with suspected poisoning on 11 November 2006 after eating at a London restaurant, and died on 23 November 2006. The police later concluded he had been poisoned with polonium; a small dose of which is lethal. Anatoly Trofimov was assassinated by unknown gunmen in April 2005. On 22 January 2007, BBC News and ITV News released documents and video footage from February 2006 in which Litvinenko made the same allegations against Prodi.

The Mitrokhin Commission, which was established in 2002 and closed in 2006 with a majority and a minority report, without reaching shared conclusions, and without any concrete evidence given to support the original allegations of KGB ties to Italian politicians contained in the Mitrokhin Archive. Led by the centre-right coalition majority, it was criticized as politically motivated, as it was focused mainly on allegations against opposition figures. In November 2006, the new Italian Parliament with a centre-left coalition majority instituted a commission to investigate the Mitrokhin Commission for allegations that it was manipulated for political purposes. In December 2006, colonel ex-KGB agent Oleg Gordievsky, whom Scaramella claimed as his source, confirmed the accusations made against Scaramella regarding the production of false material relating to Prodi and other Italian politicians, and underlined their lack of reliability.

===European Union, Ireland and Brexit===
In a 2013 interview with openDemocracy, Batten argued that the European Union was inspired by the proposals the Nazis developed in 1942 for Europe after they had won the Second World War, stating they were very similar to the 1957 Treaty of Rome.

In 2017, in response to the Irish Government&#x27;s intervention in the Brexit negotiations, Batten expressed the view on Twitter that Ireland, &quot;a tiny country that relies on UK for its existence&quot;, is &quot;the weakest kid in the playground sucking up to the EU bullies&quot;. He advocated the revocation of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK. Ireland&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, rejected Batten&#x27;s claims: &quot;Ireland is not threatening anybody, least of all a friend, but we remain resolute in our insistence on a sensible way through Brexit that protects Ireland.&quot; A UKIP spokesman said Batten&#x27;s comments do not reflect party policy.

===Views of multiculturalism and Islam===
In 2006, Batten commissioned a document from Sam Solomon, &quot;A Proposed Charter of Muslim Understanding&quot;, which amounts to a proposed code of conduct, including the rejection of passages in the Qur&#x27;an that propose &quot;violent physical Jihad&quot;, and that should be considered &quot;inapplicable, invalid and non-Islamic&quot;. When asked why Muslims should sign up to such a document, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Rowena Mason in February 2014: &quot;Christians aren&#x27;t blowing people up at the moment, are they?&quot;

Batten participated in the international counter-jihad conference in Brussels in 2007, and has been said to have long-standing links with the counter-jihad movement. In 2008, Batten invited the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) leader and MEP Geert Wilders to the European Parliament, in an unsuccessful attempt to screen Wilders&#x27; film &quot;Fitna&quot; for MEPs. According to Batten in &quot;Freedom Today&quot;, Wilders &quot;is a brave man trying to defend western civilisation in the face of its own loss of the most basic instinct of self-preservation&quot;. When Wilders was refused entry to the UK at Heathrow Airport in 2009, following an invitation from the UKIP peer Lord Pearson for Wilders to screen his film to members of the House of Lords, Batten said: &quot;We can&#x27;t do anything about murderers, rapists and paedophiles coming from the EU but they will stop a democratically elected politician from the EU talking about the sources of terrorism.&quot; In a 2010 video, Batten said that no further mosques should be built in British cities, and thought the existence of &quot;two incompatible systems living in the same place at the same time&quot; was a threat.

In 2011, Batten circulated a draft four-page document entitled &quot;Confidential draft – Dismantling Multiculturalism&quot; to Christian Concern, a lobby group. He wrote: &quot;Islamic fundamentalism is the cuckoo in the western multicultural nest. We can either address it now or be destroyed by it in the course of time.&quot; The document advocates repealing &quot;the act of parliament that gives exception for ritual slaughter for religious reasons&quot; and any law which &quot;gives official recognition to Islamic banking&quot;. The Treasury told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that no UK legislation mentions any such financial service. When asked about the document in 2014, Batten called it &quot;a rough draft which I would like to publish in due course but it&#x27;s not one of my priorities at the moment. You can&#x27;t hold me to anything in it.&quot;

In 2018, at a rally of protesters demanding the release of Tommy Robinson, Batten described Muhammad as &quot;a paedophile who kept sex slaves&quot; and, in an interview with Sky News, said that Muslim ideology legitimised sex slaves.

===Complaint of censorship ===
In 2018, Batten was featured in the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Carry on Brussels: Inside the EU&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the high point of the programme was the scene in which he left the European Parliament chamber, complaining of being censored because his microphone had been cut off. Others point out that he had overrun the allocated time for speeches.

==UKIP leadership (2018–2019)==

=== Election to leadership following the sacking of Henry Bolton ===
On 22 January 2018, Batten resigned as UKIP&#x27;s Brexit spokesman in protest at the party leadership of Henry Bolton; in the process he publicly called for Bolton to stand down from the office, amidst general dissatisfaction amongst a substantial portion of the party&#x27;s membership with the leader, collapsing membership levels, and ongoing media coverage of Bolton&#x27;s personal life. Bolton was officially dismissed as party leader on 17 February 2018, after an Extraordinary General Meeting vote by the party membership, and Batten was announced as the Party Leader (on an interim basis) until the conclusion of the next leadership election. During Batten&#x27;s initial interim leadership term, the party was saved from insolvency and put back on a sound financial footing after an appeal to members raised almost £300,000. The party was also able to pay an outstanding legal bill. In addition, UKIP also saw its first significant membership rise in two years, with over 900 members joining during this time period.

On 14 April 2018, Gerard Batten was elected unopposed as the Leader of UKIP. In a statement issued upon his appointment as Leader he said: &quot;I received the backing of all three UKIP Lords, our major donors, our MEPs, our London and Welsh Assembly Members, and party activists and members from all over the UK.&quot; Under Batten, UKIP witnessed a resurgence in support during his first six months as Leader. Opinion polls showed UKIP back between six and eight percent of the vote – with one (YouGov) revealing that almost a quarter of 2017 Conservative voters (23%) now considered UKIP to be the best party to handle Brexit, this was almost double the figure it had been in previous polling. Likewise, the proportion of 2017 Conservative voters who think that UKIP would be the best party to handle asylum and immigration had risen from 16% to 28% over the same time period. In addition to good polling, UKIP also saw its membership numbers rise further and reportedly by 15% during the month of July alone, with thousands of new activists joining the ranks of the party. Many of the new members cited Batten&#x27;s leadership and the perceived mismanagement of Britain&#x27;s EU Exit by the Conservative Government as major factors in their joining.

=== Online activists join UKIP and appointment of Tommy Robinson ===
In June 2018, Batten attempted to broaden the party&#x27;s appeal by allowing three controversial online political figures to join the party: Carl Benjamin, Mark Meechan and Paul Joseph Watson. Watson worked for the conspiracist InfoWars website, Benjamin had tweeted that he &quot;would not even rape&quot; Labour politician Jess Phillips and Meechan, known online as &quot;Count Dankula&quot;, released a video showing him teaching his girlfriend&#x27;s dog how to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute, and to react to the phrase &quot;Do you wanna gas the Jews?&quot;. The presence of the three led to criticism from antiracist groups.

In November 2018, Batten appointed anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson as his adviser on matters including &#x27;rape gangs&#x27; and prisons. The appointment was strongly criticised by Nigel Farage, who indicated an intention to seek a vote of no confidence in Batten. In response to the appointment, Farage along with many other UKIP MEPs resigned from the party in the following weeks, forcing Batten to withdraw UKIP support for the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy alliance with their MEP representation being reduced to 9 from a peak of 24 MEPs in 2014. Farage left saying: &quot;Many UKIP members – including UKIP&#x27;s NEC – urged that Robinson should not become an advisor to Batten. Sadly, these pleas fell on deaf ears.&quot; Farage likened UKIP under Batten to the British National Party. Another MEP, former leader Paul Nuttall left calling the appointment of Robinson &quot;catastrophic&quot;.

In January 2019, Farage founded the Brexit Party, and in February, established it in the European Parliament, with nine MEPs who had left UKIP joining the party: himself, Tim Aker, Jonathan Bullock, David Coburn, Bill Etheridge, Nathan Gill, Diane James, Paul Nuttall and Julia Reid.

=== Carl Benjamin comments, electoral wipeout and end of leadership term ===
In April 2019, Batten defended UKIP candidate Carl Benjamin&#x27;s social media reply in 2016, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t even rape you&quot;, to the MP Jess Phillips. Philips had written &quot;People talking about raping me isn&#x27;t fun, but has become somewhat par for the course.&quot; Batten stated on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; that Benjamin&#x27;s reply was &quot;satire against the people he was saying it about.&quot; Three more MEPs left UKIP the following day, defecting to the Brexit Party. One of these, Jane Collins, said &quot;to hear Gerard Batten on national TV yesterday defending this man&#x27;s use of rape as &#x27;satire&#x27; made me sick to my stomach.&quot; A second, Jill Seymour, said: &quot;No one person should ever be bigger than a political party but sadly I believe that Mr Batten will be instrumental in its demise.&quot;

During an interview on Sky News with Sophy Ridge in May 2019, Batten stated his position as party leader would become &quot;untenable&quot; if he were to lose his seat in the European Parliament. The 2019 European Parliament election later that month resulted in UKIP losing all of its seats, with most of its voting base switching directly to Nigel Farage&#x27;s recently formed Brexit Party, which won the election.

On 24 May 2019, Mike Hookem resigned as UKIP deputy leader and announced his candidacy in the upcoming UKIP leadership election, criticising Batten&#x27;s leadership, saying: &quot;Mr Batten&#x27;s policy direction and associations have given the mainstream media the ammunition to label our party &#x27;extreme&#x27; and &#x27;far-right&#x27;, accusations I do not believe to be true&quot;.

Batten&#x27;s extended term as UKIP leader ended on 2 June 2019, triggering a leadership election. On 27 June 2019, the closing date for nominations, Batten announced that he was standing for re-election to the party&#x27;s leadership, but on 7 July 2019, UKIP&#x27;s National Executive Committee passed a motion prohibiting him from doing so on the grounds that &#x27;he had brought the party into disrepute&#x27; during his previous tenure in the position.

==Electoral history==
Batten was the official UKIP candidate standing against Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May in the Maidenhead constituency at the 2017 general election. Out of thirteen candidates, he finished in fifth place with 871 votes, and a 1.5% share of the vote.







In the 2015 general election he stood in Romford, coming second with 22.8% of the vote.

<text>Godfrey William Bloom TD (born 22 November 1949) is a former British politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Yorkshire and the Humber from 2004 to 2014. He was elected for the UK Independence Party in the European elections of 2004 and 2009, representing UKIP until September 2013, when UKIP withdrew the party whip from him. He then sat as an Independent until the end of his term of office in May 2014. Bloom resigned his UKIP party membership on 13 October 2014.

During his tenure, he received attention for making remarks considered objectionable by his party leader, for his opinions concerning climate change and for making other controversial comments. On 20 September 2013, UKIP withdrew the party whip from Bloom after he hit journalist Michael Crick in the street with a conference brochure, threatened a second reporter, and at the party&#x27;s conference jokingly referred to his female audience as sluts. Bloom resigned his party whip from UKIP on 24 September 2013 and thereafter sat as an Independent MEP until the end of his term in office on 2 July 2014. Nigel Farage, the UKIP party leader, said &quot;the trouble with Godfrey is that, he is not a racist, he&#x27;s not an extremist or any of those things and he&#x27;s not even anti-women, but he has a sort-of-rather old-fashioned Territorial Army sense of humour which does not translate very well in modern Britain&quot;.

Bloom was removed as Honorary President of the Ludwig von Mises Centre in December 2017, the organisation citing his comments on Twitter.

==Early life==
Bloom was born on 22 November 1949, the son of Alan Bloom and his wife, Phyllis. His father served as a fighter pilot during the Second World War. Bloom was educated at St. Olave&#x27;s Grammar School.

==Military==
Bloom was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Transport (Territorial Army) in 1977. attending the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst for the two week course for territorials. In 1992 he was promoted to the rank of major. He left the TA in 1996.

==Professional career==
Bloom worked as a financial economist. In 1996 he was part of Francis Maude&#x27;s regulatory consultancy panel from which he later resigned. In his last position, he worked as the director of the investment company TBO in which he is a major shareholder.

==Political career==
Bloom contested the Conservative-held seat of Haltemprice and Howden at the 1997 general election, coming fifth.

In 2004, Bloom&#x27;s election to the Yorkshire and the Humber seat was UKIP&#x27;s first seat in the region in the European elections. In 2009, he was re-elected. In the parliament Bloom was a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights and Gender Equality.

On 20 September 2013, during its party conference, UKIP withdrew the whip from Bloom. At a party conference meeting he had jokingly referred to his female audience as . Subsequently, he got into a confrontation with journalist Michael Crick in the streets, hitting him over the head with the conference brochure, and allegedly threatened ITV reporter Paul Brand, by saying, &quot;You treat me badly, you&#x27;ll get a lot worse than that (Crick&#x27;s slap) ... that is a threat to any journalist.&quot;

On 24 September 2013, he resigned his UKIP party whip, while retaining his party membership. His statement said: &quot;I have felt for some time now that the &#x27;New UKIP&#x27; is not really right for me any more&quot;.

Bloom and Crick met again in May 2014. The two shook hands and had lunch together and Bloom thanked Crick, describing the incident as a &quot;defining moment&quot; that made him realise that he &quot;wasn’t really suited to party politics&quot;.

In December 2013, as a result of his various controversies, Bloom was awarded the Plain English Campaign&#x27;s Foot in Mouth Award. A spokesman said that Bloom was &quot;an overwhelming choice&quot; who &quot;could easily have won this award on at least two other occasions... [he&#x27;s] a wince-inducing gaffe machine and we could fill a page or two with his ill-advised quotes from 2013 alone&quot;.

==Views and incidents==
===Banking and financial crisis===
Bloom was ejected from the Mansion House in 2009 for heckling Lord Turner for giving staff bonuses after the massive regulatory failure of 2008/09. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; he was the first man to be ejected since John Wilkes in the late-18th century. In a letter to UKIP, Turner wrote that &quot;Mr Bloom will not be receiving any further invitations to Mansion House events nor will be welcome at the Brussels Annual reception [...] As to future Mansion House events we will be seeking a different MEP from UKIP as a potential guest.&quot; Bloom signed the petition in disgust at the knighthood for the failures of Hector Sants.

He is a member of the Ludwig von Mises Institute.

Bloom was a co-author of Wolfson Prize Economics Submission with Pat Barron and Philipp Bagus. He warned that credit agencies would be &quot;castrated&quot; by too much regulation of the EU. Bloom claims that most MEPs have &quot;little or no business experience&quot; and do not understand the consequences of their actions.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
A few weeks after being appointed to the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights and Gender Equality on 20 July 2004, Bloom told an interviewer that, &quot;no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age.&quot; Around the same time, he said that &quot;I just don&#x27;t think [women] clean behind the fridge enough&quot; and that &quot;I am here to represent Yorkshire women who always have dinner on the table when you get home.&quot; Bloom told BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme that his comments were &quot;said for fun&quot; to illustrate a more serious point, that equal-rights legislation was, he claimed, putting women out of work.

Bloom confessed that he had visited brothels in Hong Kong. He claimed he never consummated the visits, and also claimed &quot;terrified young women beaten into prostitution often from Eastern Europe [...] is only a very small aspect of the flesh trade&quot;, and concluded that &quot;in short, most girls do it because they want to.&quot;

After inviting students from the University of Cambridge Women&#x27;s Rugby Club to Brussels in 2004, he was accused of sexual assault, making &quot;sexist and misogynistic remarks&quot; and using offensive language during a dinner party. One student handed a formal letter of protest to the President of the European Parliament, heavily criticising Bloom&#x27;s behaviour. Bloom, who sponsored the club with £3,000 a year, admitted making misogynist comments, but denied sexual harassment.

In a piece for politics.co.uk in August 2013, Bloom attempted to set the record straight about his earlier comments on gender equality. He argued against quotas for women in boardrooms, claimed that feminism was a &quot;passing fashion&quot; created by &quot;shrill, bored, middle-class women of a certain physical genre&quot; and that any men who supported feminism were &quot;the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach.&quot; He said that women were better at &quot;[finding] the mustard in the pantry&quot; than driving a car.

===Climate change===
Bloom rejects anthropogenic global warming. He said in 2009: &quot;As far as I am concerned man-made global warming is nothing more than a hypothesis that hasn&#x27;t got any basis in fact. Every day more scientists are modifying their initial views&quot;.

===&quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; bombing===
At the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Bloom was filmed in front of the Greenpeace flagship, &quot;Rainbow Warrior II&quot;, saying, &quot;Here we have one of the most truly fascist boats since 1945, well done the French for sinking one of these things.&quot; He was referring to the 1985 bombing of the ship&#x27;s predecessor by French government agents in which Dutch photographer Fernando Pereira was killed. After criticism, the video was removed from Bloom&#x27;s YouTube channel and he said he had forgotten about the death.

===Other incidents===
In December 2008, Bloom was carried out by an intern after making a speech in the European Parliament while drunk, the second occasion on which he was accused of being drunk in the chamber. During the speech, Bloom said that the MEPs from Poland, the Czech Republic and Latvia did not understand economic relations. In February 2012, Bloom interrupted a debate with the question whether the Cambridge University Women&#x27;s Rugby team should wear their logo on the front or back of their shirts. Later he admitted consuming alcohol and &quot;very heavy&quot; prescription painkillers after breaking his collarbone in a riding accident.

On 24 November 2010, Bloom was ejected from the European Parliament after directing a Nazi slogan at German MEP Martin Schulz who was speaking in a debate on the economic crisis in Ireland. Bloom interrupted Schulz and shouted &quot;Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer&quot; at him. He then proceeded to call the latter &quot;an undemocratic fascist&quot;, a remark for which he was removed from the chamber. Labour MEP group leader Glenis Willmott described his behavior as &quot;an insult to all those who have fought against fascism&quot; whilst Liberal Democrat group leader Fiona Hall described him as a &quot;national embarrassment&quot;.

At the height of the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, Bloom complained about the lack of manners of the political class. On his website, he pointed out that, unlike many others, he would not employ family members in his parliamentary staff. Bloom later conceded that three members of his staff were also employed part-time at TBO, the company in which he is a major shareholder, and one of these is his wife&#x27;s niece. Bloom failed to declare his interest in TBO to European Parliament officials and in 2008 Bloom&#x27;s company TBO was fined £28,000 by the Financial Services Authority for &#x27;posing an &quot;unacceptable risk&quot; to customers&#x27;. In August 2014, TBO was fined and ordered to pay more than £2 million in damages to a retired couple, having ignored their request for cautious financial planning and &quot;gambled&quot; almost all their clients&#x27; money on high risk investments with an almost complete loss.

In July 2013, Bloom made a speech about Britain&#x27;s foreign aid in which he referred to countries as &quot;Bongo Bongo Land&quot;. A video was passed to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. A spokesman for UKIP was reported as saying that Bloom&#x27;s remarks were being &quot;discussed right at the very highest level of the party&quot;. After refusing to apologise, he later said he regretted the comments but clarified it by saying that whilst he intended it to be derogatory, he regretted that it had caused offence and he didn&#x27;t mean it to be racist. Party leader Nigel Farage later asked him not to use the phrase again.

In an interview in August 2013, Bloom described Prime Minister David Cameron as &quot;pigeon-chested; the sort of chap I used to beat up.&quot;

During a LBC Radio interview in November 2013, he called for the unemployed and public sector workers to lose the right to vote.

In January 2014, broadcaster Michael Crick stated that Bloom, supporting the motion &quot;Post-war Britain has seen too much immigration&quot; in a debate at the Oxford Union, asked a disabled student who was speaking against the motion if he was Richard III. According to Crick, Bloom told him that the student had taken his remark &quot;in good spirit&quot; with both sharing drinks during an after-debate reception, suggesting Crick confirm this with the student. Crick followed up the suggestion whereby the student accepted Bloom&#x27;s version of events, stating that, although the comment was not &quot;very nice,&quot; he and Bloom got on well, and that Bloom was &quot;a very interesting man to talk to.&quot; Fellow supporter of the motion, journalist and author Douglas Murray, described Bloom&#x27;s comment as &quot;gruesome&quot; and &quot;the cruellest thing.&quot;

In December 2017, Bloom wrote a tweet identifying Goldman Sachs as an &quot;international Jewish bank&quot; (in response to a tweet about Brexit by the bank&#x27;s CEO Lloyd Blankfein). The tweet was alleged to be anti-Semitic by two other tweeters.

On 2 December 2019, days after the 2019 London Bridge stabbing, Bloom tweeted in response to pleas from the father of one victim, Jack Merritt, that politicians not use his son&#x27;s death for political gains:

&quot;As I understand it your son died because he believed early release for jihadists was justified because they could be rehabilitated
Society is demanding these releases stop immediately
A very pragmatic view, nothing vile about it.
Grieve silently is my advice&quot;

<text>John Whittaker (born 7 June 1945) is a former UK Independence Party (UKIP) politician who was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the North West England region from 2004 to 2009.

Whittaker was born in Oldham, Lancashire. He was educated at Queen Mary University of London (BSc Physics, 1966) and the University of Cape Town (PhD Physics, 1980; BA Economics, 1982). He is a senior lecturer in economics at Lancaster University. His main research and teaching interests are in monetary policy and macroeconomics, and recently he has taken a particular interest in the problems associated with the single currency.

He stood for UKIP in the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election in 1995 where he came 5th out of 10 candidates behind the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.

Whittaker was the UKIP&#x27;s lead candidate in the North West for the European Parliament elections in 1999. Though UKIP gained 6.5% of the vote in the region, he fell short of being elected by about 0.5 per cent. However, in 2004 he was more successful, being one of 12 UKIP candidates to win a European seat in the big UKIP breakthrough of that year.

He contested the 2005 general election for the constituencies of Ashton under Lyne, Crosby, Heywood and Middleton, Hyndburn, Manchester Central, Rochdale, Stalybridge and Hyde and Wigan.

In 2005, Whittaker became UKIP&#x27;s official spokesman on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In September 2006, following the election of Nigel Farage as leader of UKIP, Whittaker was appointed party chairman.

<text>Ashley Mote (25 January 1936 – 30 March 2020) was a British politician who was a member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England from 2004 to 2009. Elected representing the UK Independence Party, he became a non-inscrit one month into his term after UKIP withdrew the whip from him due to investigation into his expenses.

A vociferous critic of fraud in the European Institutions, he himself was convicted of benefit fraud in 2007 for which he served a nine-month prison sentence and was described by the trial judge as &quot;a truly dishonest man&quot;. The scandal ignited a debate as to how an MEP could receive a prison sentence, yet keep his seat in the European Parliament. In 2015, Mote was jailed for a further five years for fraudulently claiming nearly £500,000 in European Parliament expenses.

==Early career==
Ashley Mote was born in London. He was educated at the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School. Married with two children, Mote was a management consultant who ran a marketing business in Woking, Surrey, employing thirteen full-time staff, for eighteen years before it closed in 1989 as a result of the late 1980s recession.

Mote later became an author, publishing several titles on right-wing politics and also on cricket. His books have included &quot;Vigilance - A Defence of British Liberty&quot; (2001) about the European Union, and &quot;OverCrowded Britain: Our Immigration Crisis&quot;. His books on cricket are &quot;The Glory Days of Cricket&quot; (1997) which won The Cricket Society&#x27;s &quot;Cricket Book of the Year&quot; award in 1997 and a new edition in 1998 of John Nyren&#x27;s classic collection of articles on the Georgian game, &quot;The Cricketers of My Time&quot; (1833). Mote was also the first president of the revived Hambledon Club which raises money for colts cricket.

==European Parliament==
In June 2004, Mote was elected to the European Parliament as a representative of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) for the South East England constituency, after campaigning to clean up sleaze in Brussels.

After being charged with fraud, Mote had the UKIP whip withdrawn from him pending his trial and became a non-attached MEP. In 2005, he joined Hans Peter Martin and Paul van Buitenen in a loose political group called &quot;Platform for Transparency&quot; which promoted accountability in the European Union. In 2006, he gave evidence to the House of Lords enquiry into the EU&#x27;s financial management of public funds. In 2007, he transferred his allegiance to the new far-right group Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty, whose members included Jean-Marie Le Pen and Alessandra Mussolini. The group was dissolved on 14 November 2007. During much of 2007 Mote was in prison in England, having been found guilty of fraud, after his attempts to claim immunity as a member of the European Parliament had proved unsuccessful. He was able to remain an MEP both during and after his months in prison.

In 2008, Mote published &quot;J&#x27;Accuse...!&quot;, an anti-EU pamphlet in which he claimed that immigrants were eight times more likely to commit crime than non-immigrant people. According to Mote, &quot;Jamaican Yardies are selling crack cocaine in Hereford and Cambridgeshire, Chinese Snakeheads are operating in Lancashire and Norfolk, Albanians are running prostitution in Hampshire, Colombians control a cocaine network in Essex.&quot;

On 9 May 2009, Mote announced he would not stand as a candidate at the 2009 European Parliament election.

==Benefits fraud conviction==
===Proceedings begin===
In 2004, the Department for Work and Pensions brought criminal charges against Mote for allegedly claiming £32,000 in income support and £35,000 in housing benefit from Chichester District Council over a six-year period without declaring his monthly earnings of £4,000. Mote was committed for trial at Chichester Crown Court on 27 April 2004. He would face nine charges of false accounting and one charge of making a false representation. On 16 June, at a plea and directions hearing, he pleaded not guilty to the charges and a trial date was fixed for 15 November. The following month, the UK Independence Party withdrew the whip from Mote on 15 July 2004 after learning from an article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that he faced trial; Mote had failed to inform his party of the impending charges.

===Application for immunity===
On 4 October 2004, Mote sought to claim immunity from prosecution on the basis of his status as an MEP. His application was heard by Judge Aikens at Lewes Crown Court. He held that Chichester Crown Court was obliged to stay proceedings until the European Parliament had exercised its right to waive immunity. On 3 February 2005, the Attorney General applied to the Parliament whose Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously granted the waiver on 20 June and gave its approval to proceedings continuing in England.

On 5 April 2005, Mote appealed the Parliament&#x27;s decision to the Court of First Instance (CFI). He gave no notice of his application to the Attorney General, nor to Judge Aikens at Lewes Crown Court, meaning that the British Government was unable to intervene in the case. Mote later applied on 15 December 2006 to the CFI for an interim order suspending the Parliament&#x27;s decision pending the outcome of their decision. This was rejected on the basis that the condition of urgency was not satisfied.

Following the Parliament&#x27;s waiver, the Attorney General applied to lift the stay imposed by Judge Aikens. The application was heard by Judge Gross on 17 October 2006 who granted the application, ruling that the desirability of proceeding with the trial outweighed any potential injustice to Mote that might result if the CFI were to annul the decision of the European Parliament to grant a waiver.

===Trial===
The case returned to England and a further 16 counts of fraud were added to Mote&#x27;s original indictment. He complained once again to the European Parliament on 4 May 2007 that this constituted a &quot;contempt&quot;, but the Parliament remarked that he had no immunity to defend and took no action. A second application was made to the CFI for interim measures, but this was also rejected.

A four-week trial commenced at Portsmouth Crown Court in July 2007; proceedings against Mote were led by government lawyers who had taken over the case from Chichester District Council in late 2005. The court heard that Mote had claimed housing and council tax benefits between 1991 and 1993 following the collapse of his business. He began to claim benefits again from 1996 but failed to declare income from various enterprises including a cleaning company and gambling on the currency markets.

In total, Mote spent just short of £73,000 between 20 February 1996 and 29 September 2002 to fund a &quot;luxury lifestyle&quot;, regularly dining out and holidaying in France, The Caribbean and the United States. He was also accused of pocketing &quot;substantial sums&quot; through his interests in two firms. Joanna Greenberg QC, prosecuting, said that from 1996, Mote had filled out benefit claim forms stating that he was unemployed and had no financial assets, even though at the time he had business interests in an international marketing firm called Tanner Management and another company, JC Commercial Management.

===Conviction===
On 17 August 2007 Mote was found guilty by a jury of 21 charges of deception by falsely claiming £65,506 in benefits, and acquitted of a further four charges. Judge Richard Price warned him to expect a custodial sentence, but allowed bail on condition that Mote surrendered his British and diplomatic passports, as well as providing £50,000 in sureties.

He was sentenced on 31 August to nine months imprisonment to be served in Ford open prison, West Sussex. During sentencing, Judge Price said that Mote, &quot;a truly dishonest man&quot;, had executed a &quot;carefully planned scheme of dishonesty&quot; and had taken &quot;a great deal of trouble to cover [his] tracks&quot;, adding that &quot;[t]o say that this case has ruined you is an understatement, it is a tragedy.&quot;

Mote&#x27;s defence counsel described his client as a Walter Mitty character and admitted that the sentence was a &quot;massive fall from grace&quot;. Mote applied for the third time to the CFI for relief against the impending imprisonment, highlighting the urgent nature of his request. This was also rejected by the CFI on 22 November 2007.

Reacting to the sentence, the leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, said he was &quot;disgusted and horrified&quot; at the leniency of the sentence. If Mote had been jailed for more than one year, he would have lost his seat in the European Parliament, which could have been reassigned to another representative. Farage added that if &quot;Mote had a shred of integrity left, he&#x27;d resign.&quot;

Mote was released from prison in November 2007 under the Government&#x27;s tagging scheme.

===Appeal===
Mote appealed the decision of Portsmouth Crown Court to the Court of Appeal on two main grounds. First, that he had applied to the European Court of Justice to have his immunity as an MEP upheld and that it was an abuse of process for the Crown Court not to have suspended the case pending its decision. Second, that the fact the jury had convicted him on 21 counts of fraud and acquitted him on 4 counts was inconsistent. Giving his judgment, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, stated that Portsmouth Crown Court had correctly decided that there was no need to wait for the CFI&#x27;s decision, noting in any case that it was unlikely the CFI would differ in its final judgment from the decision of the European Parliament. On the second ground of appeal, the Court did, however, quash one of the counts of fraud - that of failing to notify.

The CFI handed down its decision on 15 October 2008. Mote had argued that the European Parliament had incorrectly interpreted Article 8 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities concerning the immunity from prosecution of MEPs, that the Parliament should not have expressed an opinion on the merits of his fraud prosecution and that the decision to waive his immunity was &quot;unreasonable and disproportionate&quot;, inadequately reasoned and taken without full consideration of the facts and arguments he had put forward. These arguments were all rejected by the Court, which ordered him to pay the Parliament&#x27;s legal costs.

===Repayment of benefits===
The decision of Chichester District Council finding that benefits had been overpaid to Mote had been challenged by him before the Social Security Appeal Tribunal. The appeals were pending at the time Mote was committed for trial at the Crown Court, and were heard on 3 September 2004, although Mote was not present. The Tribunal dismissed the appeals, and Mote appealed to the Social Security Commissioners who dismissed his action on 20 July 2006. The Court of Appeal agreed to hear a further appeal and Mote argued that the Social Security Appeal Tribunal should have adjourned the case pending the outcome of Mote&#x27;s criminal proceedings. This was rejected by the Court which held that the continuation of the proceedings did not constitute a breach of Mote&#x27;s human rights.

As a result of the decision, Mote was obliged to repay £67,000 of the falsely claimed benefits.

==Catalyst for change in the law==
Sarah Ludford MEP called for the British Government to change the law in the wake of the Mote case, stating that the European Parliament had been powerless to intervene in the case as Mote&#x27;s eligibility as an MEP was solely a question of UK law. She expressed the sentiment that &quot;MEPs are deeply unhappy at our inability to chuck out Mr Mote.&quot; The Commons Leader Harriet Harman shared these concerns and said that she was &quot;in discussions regarding how we might explore options for reviewing the legislation&quot;, adding that &quot;[t]he aim of this would be to ensure that, in future, the salaries of MPs and MEPs who are in prison would not be paid on the basis that they are not actually carrying out all their functions.&quot;

==Expenses fraud conviction==
In 2015, Mote was jailed for five years by a British court for fraudulently claiming nearly £500,000 in European Parliament expenses. He died on 30 March 2020, at the age of 84.

<text>John Bell (February 18, 1796September 10, 1869) was an American politician, attorney, and planter who was a candidate for President of the United States in the election of 1860.

One of Tennessee&#x27;s most prominent antebellum politicians, Bell served in the House of Representatives from 1827 to 1841, and in the Senate from 1847 to 1859. He was Speaker of the House for the 23rd Congress (1834–1835), and briefly served as Secretary of War during the administration of William Henry Harrison (1841). In 1860, he ran for president as the candidate of the Constitutional Union Party, a third party which took a neutral stance on the issue of slavery. He won the electoral votes of three states by a slim margin.

Initially an ally of Andrew Jackson, Bell turned against Jackson in the mid-1830s and aligned himself with the National Republican Party and then the Whig Party, a shift that earned him the nickname &quot;The Great Apostate&quot;. He consistently battled Jackson&#x27;s allies, namely James K. Polk, over issues such as the national bank and the election spoils system. Following the death of Hugh Lawson White in 1840, Bell became the acknowledged leader of Tennessee&#x27;s Whigs.

Although a slaveholder, Bell was one of the few Southern politicians to oppose the expansion of slavery to the territories in the 1850s, and he campaigned vigorously against secession in the years leading up to the American Civil War. During his 1860 presidential campaign, he argued that secession was unnecessary since the Constitution protected slavery, an argument that resonated with voters in border states, helping him capture the electoral votes of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. After the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, marking the beginning of the Civil War, Bell abandoned the Union cause and supported the Confederacy.

==Early life and career==
John Bell was born in Mill Creek, a hamlet near Nashville in the Southwest Territory. He was one of nine children of the local farmer and blacksmith Samuel Bell and Margaret (Edmiston) Bell. His paternal grandfather, Robert Bell, had served in the American Revolution under Nathanael Greene, and his maternal grandfather, John Edmiston, had fought at Kings Mountain. He graduated from Cumberland College (later renamed the University of Nashville) in 1814 and studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1816 and established a prosperous practice in Franklin.

Entering politics, he successfully ran for the Tennessee Senate in 1817. As a state senator, he supported judicial and state constitutional reform, and voted for moving the state capital to Murfreesboro (his wife, Sally Dickinson, was a granddaughter of the town&#x27;s namesake, Hardy Murfree). After serving a single term, Bell declined to run for reelection and instead moved to Nashville, where he established a law partnership with Henry Crabb.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1826, Bell ran for Tennessee&#x27;s 7th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, which had been vacated when the incumbent, Sam Houston, was elected governor. Bell and his opponent, Felix Grundy, engaged in a bitter campaign in which both claimed to support the initiatives of Andrew Jackson. Although Jackson eventually endorsed Grundy, Bell was more popular with younger voters, and he won the election by just over a thousand votes.

Like many Southern congressmen, Bell opposed the Tariff of 1828. He also opposed federal funding for improvements to the Cumberland Road, arguing that the federal government lacked the constitutional authority to fund such a project. One of Bell&#x27;s biggest initiatives was the Tennessee land bill, in which he and fellow Tennessee congressmen James K. Polk and Davy Crockett proposed the federal government give some of its lands in Tennessee to the state in order to establish public schools. Congressmen from eastern states rejected this, however, stating that Tennessee&#x27;s mismanagement of its land resources was not the federal government&#x27;s fault, and the bill was shelved.

During Bell&#x27;s second term (1829–1831), he was chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs. As such, he wrote the Indian Removal Act, which was submitted by the committee in February 1830, and signed by President Jackson later that year. This act led to the removal of the Cherokee and other tribes to Oklahoma, via the Trail of Tears, in the latter half of the decade. One of the bill&#x27;s most vocal opponents was Massachusetts congressman Edward Everett, Bell&#x27;s future running mate in the 1860 presidential election.

Following the shake-up of Jackson&#x27;s cabinet in the wake of the Petticoat affair in 1831, Senator Hugh Lawson White recommended Bell for Secretary of War, but the appointment went to Lewis Cass instead. Bell nevertheless remained a staunch Jackson ally through his third term, opposing nullification and supporting the Force Bill.

The rift between Bell and Jackson began to show during Bell&#x27;s fourth term (1833–1835). Jackson opposed the idea of a national bank and withdrew the government&#x27;s deposits from the Bank of the United States in 1833. Bell was initially silent on the issue, while Polk defended the administration&#x27;s actions on the House floor in April 1834. In June 1834, following the resignation of Speaker of the House Andrew Stevenson, Polk sought the Speakership. Anti-Jacksonites threw their support behind Bell, however, and Bell was elected Speaker by a 114 to 78 vote. Following his election, Bell stated he was not necessarily opposed to rechartering the bank, something that Jackson vigorously opposed, and Polk&#x27;s allies assailed Bell in the press as a friend of the bank.

The final break with Jackson came in 1835 when Bell supported the presidential campaign of Hugh Lawson White, one of three members of the new Whig Party running against Jackson&#x27;s chosen successor, Martin Van Buren. Jackson dismissed Bell, White, and long-time foe Davy Crockett as &quot;hypocritical apostates.&quot; When the House of Representatives convened in 1835, Polk mounted a strong campaign for the Speakership, and defeated Bell 132 to 84. Jackson&#x27;s friends were so elated at Bell&#x27;s defeat that they held a gala at Vauxhall Gardens in Nashville, celebrating with champagne and the firing of cannons.

Bell spent much of his remaining House career sponsoring mostly unsuccessful legislation aimed at ending the spoils system. In 1837, he was again defeated by Polk for the Speakership, this time by a 116 to 103 vote. In May of the following year, the House debated a bill to address Indian hostilities, with Bell arguing in favor of negotiation, and Jackson ally Hopkins L. Turney arguing for an authorization of military force. As Bell brushed off Turney as a &quot;tool&quot; of Jackson, Turney attacked Bell, and a fistfight erupted between the two.

In 1839, Jackson tried to convince former Tennessee governor William Carroll to run against Bell, but Carroll refused, saying no one could defeat Bell in his home district. The Jacksonites finally convinced Robert Burton to run, but he was easily defeated by Bell in the general election. In March 1839, Bell&#x27;s allies in the House engineered one last attack against Polk (who was retiring to run for governor) by removing the word &quot;impartial&quot; from his customary thanks for service.

==Secretary of War==
While Bell had won reelection in 1839, Tennessee&#x27;s Whigs struggled at the state level, with incumbent Governor Newton Cannon losing to Polk, and the Democrats gaining control of the state legislature. Determined to revive the state&#x27;s Whigs, Bell spent several weeks in 1840 canvassing the state for Whig politicians. Although he initially supported party leader Henry Clay for the Whig presidential nomination, he nevertheless campaigned for the eventual nominee, William Henry Harrison, helping him capture Tennessee&#x27;s electoral votes on his way to winning the election. His efforts also helped Whig gubernatorial nominee James C. Jones defeat Polk.

When the newly elected President Harrison organized his cabinet in 1841, he offered the position of Secretary of War to Bell, following the advice of Daniel Webster. After Bell accepted, he was blasted as a hypocrite by Democrats, who pointed out that he had railed against the spoils system throughout the 1830s. After Harrison&#x27;s death, his successor, John Tyler, agreed to keep all cabinet appointments, though many members of the cabinet were skeptical that Tyler, as a former Democrat who was effectively retired when he showed interest in the Whigs, would support Whig initiatives. In May 1841, Secretary Bell issued his report on the nation&#x27;s defenses, suggesting they were outdated. He also recommended replacing civilian superintendents of national armories with military professionals, fearing that civilian superintendents lacked adequate knowledge of munitions storage.

As the cabinet members had feared, Tyler proved hostile to core Whig initiatives, vetoing a string of bills introduced by Clay and his allies in Congress and rejecting to hold cabinet votes on his decisions. Finally, on September 11, 1841, two days after Tyler vetoed the Fiscal Corporation bill, Bell and several other cabinet members followed Clay&#x27;s order and resigned in protest.

Bell returned to Tennessee to focus on personal business affairs. He continued campaigning for Whig political candidates, however, helping Jones again defeat Polk in the 1843 gubernatorial election, and helping Whig nominee Clay narrowly capture the state&#x27;s electoral votes over Polk in the 1844 presidential election, although Polk won the presidency.

==Senate==
In 1847, Bell returned to politics and was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives. He was offered the House speakership, but he declined. Shortly afterward, the legislature, now controlled by Whigs, took up the task of filling one of the state&#x27;s two U.S. Senate seats. The seat was held by a Whig, Spencer Jarnagin, who had angered the party by voting for the Walker tariff and thus had no chance of reelection. Bell, with the support of William &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow&#x27;s &quot;Jonesborough Whig&quot; and the Memphis &quot;Daily Eagle&quot;, was among those nominated to fill the seat. After several weeks and 48 rounds of voting, Bell finally received the necessary majority on November 22, 1847, beating, among others, John Netherland, Robertson Topp, William B. Reese, and Christoper H. Williams.

Shortly after his arrival in the Senate, Bell immediately began speaking out against the Mexican–American War, arguing it was a tyrannical endeavor of his old rival, James K. Polk, who was now president. He suggested that even if the war was defensive, the U.S. had no right to take over a portion of Mexico&#x27;s territory. He was concerned, among other things, that the addition of new territory would bring the divisive issue of slavery back to the forefront of American politics, especially in light of the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in the new territories. He nevertheless voted to ratify the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in March 1848.

As Bell had feared, sectional strife erupted in 1849 when California applied for statehood as a free state. Bell supported the state&#x27;s admission, and clashed over the issue on the Senate floor with fellow Southern senators John C. Calhoun and John M. Berrien. Bell offered a compromise that would have allowed California to be admitted, and would have split New Mexico and a portion of western Texas into three new states, one free, and two slave states. In May, this compromise was shelved in favor of the package of bills proposed by Henry Clay, subsequently known as the Compromise of 1850. Bell mostly supported Clay&#x27;s compromise, voting for the admission of California and the agreement on the territorial boundaries for New Mexico, but voted against the bill abolishing the slave trade in Washington, D.C.

During the latter half of his first term, Bell debated various bills regarding internal improvements, namely a bill subsidizing the construction of the Illinois Central Railroad (which he supported, though he thought proceeds from land sales should be evenly split among the states), and a bill subsidizing construction of the St. Mary&#x27;s Falls Canal, which he opposed. Bell was a steadfast supporter of Millard Fillmore, who had become president following the death of Zachary Taylor in 1850. Fillmore offered Bell the position of Secretary of the Navy in July 1852, but he turned it down.

During Bell&#x27;s second term, which began following his reelection in 1853, the Senate was plagued by sectional strife. The fighting began in early 1854 over the bill that would eventually become the Kansas–Nebraska Act. To gain the support of Southern senators, the bill contained an amendment that repealed part of the Missouri Compromise to allow slavery north of the 36°30&#x27; parallel. Bell opposed this amendment, warning that a repeal of the Missouri Compromise would lead to endless sectional strife. He was assailed by Southern senators for this stance, and was blasted on the Senate floor by Robert Toombs of Georgia. Bell was one of just two Southern senators (the other being Sam Houston) to vote against the final bill.

The division between Northern and Southern Whigs over the Kansas-Nebraska Act doomed the party, with Northern Whigs shifting to the new Republican Party. In early September 1856, he was selected to be a delegate to the 1856 National Whig Convention. The convention nominated former president Millard Fillmore, who had already been nominated by the American Party, or &quot;Know Nothings&quot;. While he campaigned for Know Nothing candidates, Bell did not endorse many of the party&#x27;s more controversial positions, such as its anti-Catholic stance. Various newspapers, including Brownlow&#x27;s &quot;Knoxville Whig&quot;, the New Orleans &quot;Delta&quot;, and the St. Louis &quot;Intelligencer&quot;, endorsed Bell as the American Party&#x27;s presidential candidate, but the party&#x27;s nomination went to Millard Fillmore.

In 1857, Democrats regained control of the Tennessee state legislature. They elected Andrew Johnson to fill the expiring term of Senator James C. Jones. Although Bell&#x27;s term didn&#x27;t expire for another two years, the legislature was so disgusted with him that they went ahead and chose his replacement (Alfred O. P. Nicholson) and demanded that he resign. He was continuously attacked by other Southern senators. In late 1857, he threatened to challenge Robert Toombs to a duel after Toombs called him an abolitionist, but Toombs retracted the statement. In February 1858, Bell and Johnson were involved in a heated altercation on the Senate floor after Johnson questioned Bell&#x27;s loyalty to the South.

In March 1858, Bell was one of just two Southern senators (the other being John J. Crittenden) to vote against the admission of Kansas under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution, ignoring orders from the Tennessee state legislature to vote for it. In his last session in the Senate in 1859, Bell voted against an attempt to purchase Cuba from Spain, opposed the Homestead bill, and voted in favor of subsidies for the Pacific Railroad.

==Presidential candidacy==

Annoyed by the continuous sectional strife in the Senate, Bell throughout the 1850s had pondered forming a third party to attract moderates from both the North and South. By 1859, the Know Nothing movement had collapsed, but Tennessee&#x27;s Whigs had organized themselves into the Opposition Party, which had won several of the state&#x27;s congressional seats. Several of this party&#x27;s supporters, among them &quot;Knoxville Whig&quot; editor William Brownlow, former vice presidential candidate Andrew Jackson Donelson, and California attorney Balie Peyton urged Bell to run for president on a third party ticket.

In May 1860, disgruntled ex-Whigs and disenchanted moderates from across the country convened in Baltimore, where they formed the Constitutional Union Party. The party&#x27;s platform was very broad and made no mention of slavery. While there were several candidates for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination, the two frontrunners were Bell and Sam Houston. On May 9, Bell led the initial round of balloting with 68 votes to Houston&#x27;s 59, with more than a dozen other candidates splitting the remainder. Houston&#x27;s military endeavors had brought him national renown, but he reminded the convention&#x27;s Clay Whigs of their old foe Andrew Jackson. On May 10, Bell received 138 votes to Houston&#x27;s 69, and was declared the candidate. Edward Everett received the vice presidential nomination.

While Bell had supporters throughout the Northern states and the border states, most of his Northern allies had thrown their support behind Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln or Democratic candidate Stephen A. Douglas. He had little support south of the border states, where Southern Democratic candidate John C. Breckinridge was the clear frontrunner. Southern Democratic newspapers slammed him as a friend of abolitionists and Republicans. The Nashville &quot;Union&quot;, referring to the Constitutional Union Party&#x27;s noncommitted platform, derided Bell as &quot;Nobody&#x27;s man,&quot; who &quot;stands on nobody&#x27;s platform.&quot; Bell also struggled with the youth vote, being more than a decade older than the next oldest candidate, Lincoln.

Seeing little chance of winning the election outright, Bell hoped that none of the three other candidates would get the required number of electoral votes and that the election would be sent to the House of Representatives, where he was convinced he would be chosen as a compromise since he was the only non-sectional candidate. Neither he nor Everett campaigned extensively. However, Bell and his supporters knew they still needed to finish in the top three in the electoral college to be eligible for the contingent election as per the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment. The Constitutional Union campaign therefore directed most of its resources in the Upper South states which they believed they had the best chance of winning.

In the general election in November 1860, Bell received 592,906 popular votes (13% of the total; 39% of Southern popular votes). He finished third in the electoral college with 39 electoral votes (13%), nevertheless Lincoln secured a decisive victory by winning nearly all of the Northern electoral votes. Bell carried Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee with narrow pluralities over Breckinridge, but was narrowly defeated by Breckinridge in Maryland, North Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, and by Douglas in Missouri, and lost badly in Delaware, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas. While Bell received less than 3% of the popular vote cast in Northern states, several of his electors were on fusion tickets with Douglas and Breckinridge electors, so this figure may not be representative of his actual support.

==Civil War==
In the months following Lincoln&#x27;s election, Bell remained steadfast in his support for the Union. During March 1861, he met Lincoln, who, according to Bell, said that he had no intention of using force against the South. After the Battle of Fort Sumter in April, however, Bell, despite continuing to believe in the illegality of secession, complained that he felt deceived by Lincoln. While he still supported preserving the Union if at all possible, he reasoned that if federal forces invaded Tennessee, they should be resisted. Accordingly, on April 23, he openly opposed Lincoln, called for the state to align itself with the Confederacy, and urged that it prepare a defense against a federal invasion.

Bell&#x27;s defection to the Confederate cause stunned Unionist leaders. &quot;Louisville Journal&quot; editor George D. Prentice wrote that Bell&#x27;s decision brought &quot;unspeakable mortification, and disgust, and indignation&quot; to his long-time supporters. Horace Greeley lamented such an &quot;ignominious close&quot; to Bell&#x27;s public career. &quot;Knoxville Whig&quot; editor (and future Tennessee governor) William Brownlow derided Bell as the &quot;officiating Priest&quot; at the altar of the &quot;false god of Disunion.&quot;

In June 1861, Bell traveled to Knoxville in hopes of converting the city&#x27;s Unionist leaders to the secessionist cause and perhaps changing sentiments in the state&#x27;s east, where most people remained pro-Union. On June 6, Bell delivered a speech before a crowd of secessionists at the Knox County Courthouse. Following the speech, he walked across the street to the law office of long-time Whig attorney Oliver Perry Temple, where Temple and several other pro-Union leaders had gathered. Among them were Brownlow, Perez Dickinson, and William Rule. Temple later recalled:Mr. Bell said, in a half-sad and half-complaining tone: &quot;I see that none of my old friends were over to hear me speak.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Brownlow, &quot;we were not present, and did not intend being. We did not wish to witness the spectacle of your being surrounded by your enemies, who a few months ago were denouncing you as a traitor. We did not wish to hear these men shouting for you and see you in such a position.&quot; Mr. Brownlow then poured forth a torrent of abuse and denunciation of secession. Mr. Bell made no attempt to defend them, nor indeed to defend his own course.Brownlow had supported Bell for over two decades and, indeed, had named one of his sons after Bell. He recalled the incident in Temple&#x27;s office when he came to write his 1862 book, &quot;Sketches of the Rise, Progress, and Decline of Secession&quot;. In that volume, Brownlow stated he had criticized Bell that night with &quot;great pain,&quot; and remembered that he and Bell &quot;parted in tears.&quot; Temple surmised that Bell&#x27;s decision to support the Confederacy was driven by panic, for &quot;there was not a drop of disloyal blood in his veins.&quot;

After Tennessee seceded on June 8, Bell retired from public life, though his sons and sons-in-law actively supported the Confederate cause. When the Union Army occupied Tennessee in 1862, Bell fled to Huntsville, Alabama, and later to Georgia. After the war, he moved to Stewart County, Tennessee, where he managed his family-owned ironworks. He died at his home near Dover, Tennessee in 1869, and he is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

==Family==
Bell married his first wife, Sally Dickinson, in 1818. They had five children (Mary, John, David, Fanny, and Sally) before she died in 1832. Sally Dickinson was the sister of Congressman David W. Dickinson, the granddaughter of Hardy Murfree, and the aunt of author Mary Noailles Murfree. In 1835, Bell married Jane Erwin Yeatman, a prominent socialite and widow of wealthy businessman Thomas Yeatman.

Confederate Congressman Edwin Augustus Keeble (1807–1868) was a son-in-law of Bell&#x27;s, being married to his daughter, Sally. Bell&#x27;s great-grandson, also named Edwin A. Keeble, was a prominent Nashville-area architect, his best known design being the city&#x27;s first skyscraper, the Life &amp; Casualty Tower.

<text>Michael Henry Nattrass (born 14 December 1945) is a British politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the West Midlands constituency, from 2004 to 2014. He was elected as a candidate for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) for the first time in June 2004 and re-elected in June 2009, but resigned from the party in September 2013. He lost his seat in the May 2014 election.

==Political career==
In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party, whose candidates were absorbed into the Referendum Party in 1997. Standing in Solihull, he gained the highest vote in the West Midlands for the Referendum Party at the 1997 general election (4.7%). In 1998, he accepted an invitation to join UKIP from its leader Michael Holmes and sat on the UKIP National Executive Committee. In 2000 he became Party Chairman under Leader Jeffrey Titford and from 2002 to 2006 he was Deputy Leader under Roger Knapman.

Nattrass stood unsuccessfully in many parliamentary general elections and by-elections representing UKIP, including Sutton Coldfield in 2001 (finishing fourth of five with 2.7%), the May 2008 Crewe and Nantwich by-election (fourth of ten, with 2.2%), and South Staffordshire in 2010 (fourth of six with 5.5%).

He was elected to the European Parliament in 2004, one of 12 seats won by UKIP, with 16.1% of the vote. Nattrass was re-elected in West Midlands in June 2009.

Nattrass failed a candidate assessment test in August 2013 and was deselected by the party for the 2014 European election. He took the party to court over the decision, but lost. He said he was considering standing as an independent at the next election. He left UKIP in September 2013.

Nattrass was in talks with the English Democrats about the possibility of joining them, and agreed to speak at their September 2013 conference, but he chose not to after the party prematurely claimed he was joining them, citing concerns about elements in the party. In November 2013, Nattrass announced the creation of his new party, called An Independence Party. At the 2014 European election, the party stood as Independence from Europe but failed to win any seats.

<doc id="724150" wikidata="Q492655" url="?curid=724150" title="Cox's Orange Pippin">
<text>Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin, in Britain often referred to simply as Cox, is an apple cultivar first grown in 1825 or 1830 at Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire, England, by the retired brewer and horticulturist Richard Cox.

Though the parentage of the cultivar is unknown, Ribston Pippin seems a likely candidate. DNA analysis of major apple pedigrees has suggested Margil as the parent of Cox, with Ribston Pippin being another Margil seedling. The variety was introduced for sale by the 1850s by Charles Turner, and grown commercially from the 1860s, particularly in the Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire, and later in Kent.

==Description and uses==
&#x27;Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin&#x27; is highly regarded for its excellent flavour and attractive appearance. The apples are of medium size, orange-red in colour, deepening to bright red and mottled with carmine over a deep yellow background. The flesh is very aromatic, yellow-white, fine-grained, crisp, and very juicy. Cox&#x27;s flavour is sprightly subacid, with hints of cherry and anise, becoming softer and milder with age. When ripe apples are shaken, the seeds make a rattling sound as they are only loosely held in the apple&#x27;s flesh.

Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin is often blended with other varieties in the production of cider.
*S genotype S5 S9.
*Vitamin C 10 mg/100 gram
*Density 0.85

==Cultivation==

According to the Institute of Food Research, Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin accounts for over 50% of the UK acreage of dessert apples. The tree is a moderate grower and is annually productive. However, it can be difficult to grow in many environments, and tends to be susceptible to diseases such as scab, mildew, and canker, so it is rarely grown commercially in North America. Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin is also grown in Belgium and in the Netherlands, countries with a climate similar to that of Great Britain. In addition to the cultivation of Cox sports, apple breeders have hybridised Cox with other varieties to improve vigour, disease resistance, and yield, while attempting to retain the unique qualities of Cox&#x27;s flavour.

=== Sports === 
A number of sports of Cox&#x27;s Orange Pippin have been discovered over subsequent years and propagated. These retain &quot;Cox&quot; in their names, e.g., Cherry Cox, Crimson Cox, King Cox, and Queen Cox.
