<text>In physics and chemistry, flash freezing is a process by which an object rapidly freezes. This is done by subjecting an object to cryogenic temperatures, or through direct contact with liquid nitrogen at . This process closely related to classical nucleation theory. Flash freezing is commonly applied in the food industry and is studied in atmospheric science.

When water freezes slowly, crystals grow from fewer nucleation sites, resulting in fewer and larger ice crystals. This damages cell walls and causes cell dehydration. When water freezes quickly, as in flash freezing, there are more nucleation sites, and more, smaller crystals. This results in much less damage to cell walls, proportional to the rate of freezing. This is why flash freezing is good for food and tissue preservation.

== Applications and techniques ==

Flash freezing is used in the food industry to quickly freeze perishable food items (see frozen food). In this case, food items are subjected to temperatures well below the freezing point of water. Thus, smaller ice crystals are formed, causing less damage to cell membranes. American inventor Clarence Birdseye developed the &quot;quick-freezing&quot; process of food preservation in the 20th century using a cryogenic process. In practice, a mechanical freezing process is usually used instead due to cost. There has been continuous optimization of the freezing rate in mechanical freezing to minimize ice crystal size.

Flash freezing techniques are also used to freeze biological samples quickly so that large ice crystals cannot form and damage the sample. This is done by submerging the sample in liquid nitrogen or a mixture of dry ice and ethanol.

Flash freezing is of great importance in atmospheric science, as its study is necessary for a proper climate model for the formation of ice clouds in the upper troposphere, which effectively scatter incoming solar radiation and prevent Earth from becoming overheated by the Sun. The results have important implications in climate control research. One of the current debates is whether the formation of ice occurs near the surface or within the micrometre-sized droplets suspended in clouds. If it is the former, effective engineering approaches may exist to tune the surface tension of water so that the ice crystallization rate can be controlled.

== How water freezes ==
The surface environment does not play a decisive role in the formation of ice and snow. Density fluctuations within water droplets result in the possible freezing regions covering both the interior and the surface—that is, whether freezing from the surface or from within may be at random.

There are phenomena like supercooling, in which the water is cooled below its freezing point but remains liquid if there are too few defects to seed crystallization. One can therefore observe a delay until the water adjusts to the new, below-freezing temperature. Supercooled liquid water must become ice at , not just because of the extreme cold, but because the molecular structure of water changes physically to form tetrahedron shapes, with each water molecule loosely bonded to four others. This suggests the structural change from liquid to &quot;intermediate ice&quot;. The crystallization of ice from supercooled water is generally initiated by a process called nucleation. The speed and size of nucleation occurs within nanoseconds and nanometers.

As water freezes, tiny amounts of liquid water are theoretically still present, even as temperatures go below and almost all the water has turned solid, either into crystalline ice or amorphous water. However, this remaining liquid water crystallizes too fast for its properties to be detected or measured. The freezing speed directly influences the nucleation process and ice crystal size. A supercooled liquid will stay in a liquid state below the normal freezing point when it has little opportunity for nucleation—that is, if it is pure enough and is in a smooth-enough container. Once agitated it will rapidly become a solid.

During the final stage of freezing, an ice drop develops a pointy tip, which is not observed for most other liquids, and arises because water expands as it freezes. Once the liquid is completely frozen, the sharp tip of the drop attracts water vapor in the air, much like a sharp metal lightning rod attracts electrical charges. The water vapor collects on the tip and a tree of small ice crystals starts to grow. An opposite effect has been shown to preferentially extract water molecules from the sharp edge of potato wedges in the oven.

If a microscopic droplet of water is cooled very fast, it forms a glass—a low-density amorphous ice in which all the tetrahedral water molecules are not aligned but amorphous. The change in the structure of water controls the rate at which ice forms. Depending on its temperature and pressure, water ice has 16 different crystalline forms in which water molecules cling to each other with hydrogen bonds.

== Related quantities ==
To understand flash freezing, the following technical explanations may be useful.

=== Nucleation ===
Crystal growth or nucleation is the formation of a new thermodynamic phase or a new structure via self-assembly. Nucleation is often found to be very sensitive to impurities in the system. For nucleation of a new thermodynamic phase, such as the formation of ice in water below , if the system is not evolving with time and nucleation occurs in one step, then the probability that nucleation has not occurred should undergo exponential decay. This can also be observed in the nucleation of ice in supercooled small water droplets. The decay rate of the exponential gives the nucleation rate and is given by
:formula_1
where 
* formula_2 is the number of nucleation sites;
* formula_3 is the probability that a nucleus at the top of the barrier will go on to form the new phase, not dissolve (called the Zeldovich factor);
* formula_4 is the rate at which molecules attach to the nucleus, causing it to grow;
* formula_5 is the free energy cost of the nucleus at the top of the nucleation barrier;
* formula_6 is the thermal energy, where formula_7 is the absolute temperature and formula_8 is the Boltzmann constant.

Classical nucleation theory is a widely used approximate theory for estimating these rates, and how they vary with variables such as temperature. It correctly predicts that the time needed for nucleation decreases extremely rapidly when supersaturated.

Nucleation can be divided into homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation. Homogeneous nucleation is the rarer, but simpler, case. In homogeneous nucleation, classical nucleation theory assumes that for a microscopic, spherical nucleus of a new phase, the free energy change of a droplet formula_9 is a function of the size of the nucleus, and can be written as the sum of terms proportional to the nucleus&#x27; volume and surface area:
:formula_10
The first term represents volume, and (assuming a spherical nucleus) this is the volume of a sphere of radius formula_11. Here, formula_12 is the difference in free energy per unit volume between the thermodynamic phase in which nucleation is occurring, and the phase that is nucleating. The second term represents the surface area, again assuming a sphere, where formula_13 is the surface tension.

At some intermediate value of formula_11, the free energy formula_15 goes through a maximum, and so the probability of formation of a nucleus goes through a minimum. This occurs when formula_16. This point, formula_5, is called the &quot;critical nucleus&quot; and represents the &quot;nucleation barrier&quot;; it occurs at the critical radius
:formula_18
The addition of new molecules to nuclei larger than this critical radius decreases the free energy, so these nuclei are more probable.

Heterogeneous nucleation occurs at a surface or impurity. In this case, part of the nucleus boundary is accommodated by the surface or impurity onto which it is nucleating. This reduces the surface area term in formula_15, and thus lowers the nucleation barrier formula_5. This lowered barrier is what makes heterogeneous nucleation much more common and faster than homogeneous nucleation.

=== Laplace pressure ===
The Laplace pressure is the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of a curved surface between a gas region and a liquid region. The Laplace pressure is determined from the Young–Laplace equation given as
:formula_21
where formula_22 and formula_23 are the principal radii of curvature and formula_24 (also denoted as formula_13) is the surface tension.

The surface tension can be defined in terms of force or energy. The surface tension of a liquid is the ratio of the change in the liquid&#x27;s energy and the change in the liquid&#x27;s surface area (which led to the change in energy). It can be defined as formula_26. This work formula_27 is interpreted as the potential energy.

<text>William Franklin Graham Jr. (; November 7, 1918 – February 21, 2018) was an American evangelist, ordained Southern Baptist minister, and civil rights advocate, whose broadcasts and world tours featuring live sermons became well known in the mid- to late 20th century. Throughout his career, spanning over six decades, Graham rose to prominence as an evangelical Christian figure in the United States and abroad.

According to a biographer, Graham was considered &quot;among the most influential Christian leaders&quot; of the 20th century. Beginning in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Graham became known for filling stadiums and other massive venues around the world where he preached live sermons; these were often broadcast via radio and television with some continuing to be seen into the 21st century. During his six decades on television, Graham hosted his annual &quot;crusades&quot;, evangelistic live-campaigns, from 1947 until his retirement in 2005. He also hosted the radio show &quot;Hour of Decision&quot; from 1950 to 1954. He openly repudiated racial segregation, at a time of intense racial strife in the United States, insisting on racial integration for all of his revivals and crusades, as early as 1953. He also later invited Martin Luther King Jr. to preach jointly at a revival in New York City in 1957. In addition to his religious aims, he helped shape the worldview of a huge number of people who came from different backgrounds, leading them to find a relationship between the Bible and contemporary secular viewpoints. According to his website, Graham spoke to live audiences consisting of at least 210 million people, in more than 185 countries and territories, through various meetings, including BMS World Mission and Global Mission event.

Graham was close to US presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson (one of his closest friends), and Richard Nixon. He was also lifelong friends with Robert Schuller, another televangelist and the founding pastor of the Crystal Cathedral, whom Graham talked into starting his own television ministry. Graham&#x27;s evangelism was appreciated by mainline Protestant denominations, as he encouraged mainline Protestants, who were converted to his evangelical message, to remain within or return to their mainline churches. Despite early suspicions and apprehension on his part towards Catholicism—common among contemporaneous evangelical Protestants—Graham eventually developed amicable ties with many American Catholic Church figures, later encouraging unity between Catholics and Protestants.

Graham operated a variety of media and publishing outlets; according to his staff, more than 3.2 million people have responded to the invitation at Billy Graham Crusades to &quot;accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior&quot;. Graham&#x27;s lifetime audience, including radio and television broadcasts, likely surpassed billions of people. As a result of his crusades, Graham preached the gospel to more people, live and in-person, than anyone in the history of Christianity. Graham was on Gallup&#x27;s list of most admired men and women a record-61 times. Grant Wacker wrote that, by the mid-1960s, he had become the &quot;Great Legitimator&quot;, saying: &quot;By then his presence conferred status on presidents, acceptability on wars, shame on racial prejudice, desirability on decency, dishonor on indecency, and prestige on civic events.&quot;

==Early life==

William Franklin Graham Jr. was born on November 7, 1918, in the downstairs bedroom of a farmhouse near Charlotte, North Carolina. Of Scots-Irish descent, he was the eldest of four children born to Morrow (née Coffey) and dairy farmer William Franklin Graham Sr. Graham was raised on the family dairy farm with his two younger sisters Catherine Morrow and Jean and younger brother Melvin Thomas. When he was nine years old, the family moved about from their white frame house to a newly built red brick house. He was raised by his parents in the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Graham attended the Sharon Grammar School. He started to read books from an early age and loved to read novels for boys, especially &quot;Tarzan&quot;. Like Tarzan, he would hang on the trees and gave the popular Tarzan yell. According to his father, that yelling led him to become a minister. Graham was 15 when Prohibition ended in December 1933, and his father forced him and his sister Catherine to drink beer until they became sick. This created such an aversion that the two siblings avoided alcohol and drugs for the rest of their lives.

Graham was turned down for membership in a local youth group for being &quot;too worldly&quot;. Albert McMakin, who worked on the Graham farm, persuaded him to go see evangelist Mordecai Ham. According to his autobiography, Graham was 16 when he was converted during a series of revival meetings that Ham led in Charlotte in 1934.

After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham attended Bob Jones College. After one semester, he found that the coursework and rules were too legalistic. He was almost expelled, but Bob Jones Sr. warned him not to throw his life away: &quot;At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily.&quot;

In 1937, Graham transferred to the Florida Bible Institute in Temple Terrace, Florida. While still a student, Graham preached his first sermon at Bostwick Baptist Church near Palatka, Florida. In his autobiography, Graham wrote of receiving his calling on the 18th green of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club, which was adjacent to the institute&#x27;s campus. Reverend Billy Graham Memorial Park was later established on the Hillsborough River, directly east of the 18th green and across from where Graham often paddled a canoe to a small island in the river, where he would practice preaching to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. In 1939, Graham was ordained by a group of Southern Baptist clergy at Peniel Baptist Church in Palatka, Florida. In 1940, he graduated with a Bachelor of Theology degree.

Graham then enrolled in Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. During his time there, he decided to accept the Bible as the infallible word of God. Henrietta Mears of the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood in California was instrumental in helping Graham wrestle with the issue. He settled it at Forest Home Christian Camp (now called Forest Home Ministries) southeast of the Big Bear Lake area in southern California. While attending Wheaton, Graham was invited to preach one Sunday in 1941 at the United Gospel Tabernacle church. After that, the congregation repeatedly asked Graham to preach at their church and later asked him to become the pastor of their church. After Graham prayed and sought advice from his friend Dr. Edman, Graham become their church&#x27;s pastor.

In June 1943, Graham graduated from Wheaton College with a degree in anthropology. That same year, Robert Van Kampen, treasurer of the National Gideon Association, invited Graham to preach at Western Springs Baptist Church, and Graham accepted the opportunity on the spot. While there, his friend Torrey Johnson, pastor of the Midwest Bible Church in Chicago, told Graham that his radio program, &quot;Songs in the Night&quot;, was about to be canceled due to lack of funding. Consulting with the members of his church in Western Springs, Graham decided to take over Johnson&#x27;s program with financial support from his congregation. Launching the new radio program on January 2, 1944, still called &quot;Songs in the Night&quot;, Graham recruited the bass-baritone George Beverly Shea as his director of radio ministry.

In 1948, in a Modesto, California hotel room, Graham and his evangelistic team established the Modesto Manifesto: a code of ethics for life and work to protect against accusations of financial, sexual, and power abuse. The code includes rules for collecting offerings in churches, working only with churches supportive of cooperative evangelism, using official crowd estimates at outdoor events, and a commitment to never be alone with a woman other than his wife (which become known as the &quot;Billy Graham rule&quot;).

Graham was 29 when he became president of Northwestern Bible College in Minneapolis in 1948. He was the youngest president of a college or university in the country, and held the position for four years before he resigned in 1952. Graham initially intended to become a chaplain in the Armed Forces, but he contracted mumps shortly after applying for a commission. After a period of recuperation in Florida, he was hired as the first full-time evangelist of the new Youth for Christ (YFC), co-founded by Torrey Johnson and the Canadian evangelist Charles Templeton. Graham traveled throughout both the United States and Europe as a YFCI evangelist. Templeton applied to Princeton Theological Seminary for an advanced theological degree and urged Graham to do so as well, but he declined as he was already serving as the president of Northwestern Bible College.

===Crusades===

The first Billy Graham Crusade was held on September 13–21, 1947, at the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was attended by 6,000 people. Graham was 28 years old then, and would rent a large venue (such as a stadium, park, or even a street); as the crowds became larger, he arranged for a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the gospel and invite individuals to come forward (a practice begun by Dwight L. Moody); such people were called &quot;inquirers&quot; and were given the chance to speak one-on-one with a counselor to clarify questions and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the Gospel of John or a Bible study booklet.

In 1949, Graham scheduled a series of revival meetings in Los Angeles, for which he erected circus tents in a parking lot. He attracted national media coverage, especially in the conservative Hearst chain of newspapers, although Hearst and Graham never met. The crusade event ran for eight weeks–five weeks longer than originally planned. Graham became a national figure, with heavy coverage from the wire services and national magazines. Pianist Rudy Atwood, who played for the tent meetings, wrote that they &quot;rocketed Billy Graham into national prominence, and resulted in the conversion of a number of show-business personalities&quot;.

In 1953, Graham was offered a five-year, $1 million contract from NBC to appear on television opposite Arthur Godfrey, but he had prior commitments and turned-down the offer to continue his live touring revivals. Graham held crusades in London that lasted 12 weeks, and a New York City crusade at Madison Square Garden, in 1957, ran nightly for 16 weeks. At a 1973 rally, attended by 100,000 people, in Durban, South Africa—the first large mixed-race event in apartheid South Africa—Graham openly declared that &quot;apartheid is a sin&quot;. In Moscow, Russia, in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham&#x27;s audience went-forward at his call. During his crusades, he frequently used the altar call song, &quot;Just As I Am&quot;. In 1995, during the Global Mission event, he preached a sermon at Estadio Hiram Bithorn in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that was transmitted by satellite to 185 countries and translated into 116 languages.

By the time of his last crusade in 2005 in New York City, he had preached 417 live crusades, including 226 in the US and 195 abroad.

====Student ministry====
Graham spoke at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship&#x27;s Urbana Student Missions Conference at least nine times – in 1948, 1957, 1961, 1964, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1984, and 1987.

At each Urbana conference, he challenged the thousands of attendees to make a commitment to follow Jesus Christ for the rest of their lives. He often quoted a six-word phrase that was reportedly written in the Bible of William Whiting Borden, the son of a wealthy silver magnate: &quot;No reserves, no retreat, no regrets&quot;. Borden had died in Egypt on his way to the mission field.

Graham also held evangelistic meetings on a number of college campuses: at the University of Minnesota during InterVarsity&#x27;s &quot;Year of Evangelism&quot; in 1950–51, a 4-day mission at Yale University in 1957, and a week-long series of meetings at the University of North Carolina&#x27;s Carmichael Auditorium in September 1982.

In 1955, he was invited by Cambridge University students to lead the mission at the university; the mission was arranged by the Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, with London pastor-theologian John Stott serving as Graham&#x27;s chief assistant. This invitation was greeted with much disapproval in the correspondence columns of &quot;The Times&quot;.

====Evangelistic association====
In 1950, Graham founded the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) with its headquarters in Minneapolis. The association relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2003, and maintains a number of international offices, such as in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Buenos Aires. BGEA ministries have included:

* &quot;Hour of Decision&quot;, a weekly radio program broadcast around the world for 66 years (1950–2016)
* Mission television specials broadcast in almost every market in the US and Canada
* A syndicated newspaper column, &quot;My Answer&quot;, carried by newspapers across the United States and distributed by Tribune Content Agency
* &quot;Decision&quot; magazine, the official publication of the association
* &quot;Christianity Today,&quot; started in 1956 with Carl F. H. Henry as its first editor
* Passageway.org, the website for a youth discipleship program created by BGEA
* World Wide Pictures, which has produced and distributed more than 130 films

In April 2013, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started &quot;My Hope With Billy Graham&quot;, the largest outreach in its history. It encouraged church members to spread the gospel in small group meetings, after showing a video message by Graham. &quot;The idea is for Christians to follow the example of the disciple Matthew in the New Testament and spread the gospel in their own homes.&quot; &quot;The Cross&quot; video is the main program in the My Hope America series, and was also broadcast the week of Graham&#x27;s 95th birthday.

====Civil rights movement====
Graham&#x27;s early crusades were segregated, but he began adjusting his approach in the 1950s. During a 1953 rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Graham tore down the ropes that organizers had erected to segregate the audience into racial sections. In his memoirs, he recounted that he told two ushers to leave the barriers down &quot;or you can go on and have the revival without me.&quot; During a sermon held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville on August 23, 1954, he warned a white audience, &quot;Three-fifths of the world is not white. They are rising all over the world. We have been proud and thought we were better than any other race, any other people. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you that we are going to stumble into hell because of our pride.&quot;

In 1957, Graham&#x27;s stance towards integration became more publicly shown when he allowed black ministers Thomas Kilgore and Gardner C. Taylor to serve as members of his New York Crusade&#x27;s executive committee. He also invited Martin Luther King Jr., whom he first met during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, to join him in the pulpit at his 16-week revival in New York City, where 2.3 million gathered at Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium, and Times Square to hear them. Graham recalled in his autobiography that during this time, he and King developed a close friendship and that he was eventually one of the few people who referred to King as &quot;Mike&quot;, a nickname which King asked only his closest friends to call him. Following King&#x27;s assassination in 1968, Graham mourned that the US had lost &quot;a social leader and a prophet&quot;. In private, Graham advised King and other members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

Despite their friendship, tensions between Graham and King emerged in 1958, when the sponsoring committee of a crusade that took place in San Antonio, Texas, on July 25 arranged for Graham to be introduced by that state&#x27;s segregationist governor, Price Daniel. On July 23, King sent a letter to Graham and informed him that allowing Daniel to speak at a crusade which occurred the night before the state&#x27;s Democratic Primary &quot;can well be interpreted as your endorsement of racial segregation and discrimination.&quot; Graham&#x27;s advisor, Grady Wilson, replied to King that &quot;even though we do not see eye to eye with him on every issue, we still love him in Christ.&quot; Though Graham&#x27;s appearance with Daniel dashed King&#x27;s hopes of holding joint crusades with Graham in the Deep South, the two remained friends; the next year King told a Canadian television audience that Graham had taken a &quot;very strong stance against segregation.&quot; Graham and King would also come to differ on the Vietnam War. After King&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot; speech denouncing US intervention in Vietnam, Graham castigated him and others for their criticism of US foreign policy.

By the middle of 1960, King and Graham traveled together to the Tenth Baptist World Congress of the Baptist World Alliance. In 1963, Graham posted bail for King to be released from jail during the Birmingham (Alabama) campaign, according to Michael Long, and the King Center acknowledged that Graham had bailed King out of jail during the Albany Movement, although historian Steven Miller told CNN he could not find any proof of the incident. Graham held integrated crusades in Birmingham on Easter of 1964, in the aftermath of the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, and toured Alabama again in the wake of the violence that accompanied the first Selma to Montgomery march in 1965.

Following Graham&#x27;s death, former SCLC official and future Atlanta politician Andrew Young (who spoke alongside Coretta Scott King at Graham&#x27;s 1994 crusade in Atlanta), acknowledged his friendship with Graham and stated that Graham did in fact travel with King to the 1965 European Baptist Convention. Young also claimed that Graham had often invited King to his crusades in the Northern states. Former Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) leader and future United States Congressman John Lewis also credited Graham as a major inspiration for his activism. Lewis described Graham as a &quot;saint&quot; and someone who &quot;taught us how to live and who taught us how to die&quot;.

Graham&#x27;s faith prompted his maturing view of race and segregation. He told a member of the Ku Klux Klan that integration was necessary, primarily for religious reasons. &quot;There is no scriptural basis for segregation,&quot; Graham argued. &quot;The ground at the foot of the cross is level, and it touches my heart when I see whites standing shoulder to shoulder with blacks at the cross.&quot;
==== Lausanne Movement ====
The friendship between Graham and John Stott led to a further partnership in the Lausanne Movement, of which Graham was a founder. It built on Graham&#x27;s 1966 World Congress on Evangelism in Berlin. In collaboration with &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, Graham convened what &quot;Time&quot; magazine described as &quot;a formidable forum, possibly the widest–ranging meeting of Christians ever held&quot; with 2,700 participants from 150 nations gathering for the International Congress on World Evangelization. Women were represented by Millie Dienert, who chaired the prayer committee. This took place in Lausanne, Switzerland (July 16–25, 1974), and the movement which ensued took its name from the host city. Its purpose was to strengthen the global church for world evangelization, and to engage ideological and sociological trends which bore on this. Graham invited Stott to be chief architect of the Lausanne Covenant, which issued from the Congress and which, according to Graham: &quot;helped challenge and unite evangelical Christians in the great task of world evangelization.&quot; The movement remains a significant fruit of Graham&#x27;s legacy, with a presence in nearly every nation.

==Multiple roles==

Graham played multiple roles that reinforced each other. Grant Wacker identified eight major roles that he played: preacher, icon, Southerner, entrepreneur, architect (bridge builder), pilgrim, pastor, and his widely recognized status as America&#x27;s Protestant patriarch, which was on a par with Martin Luther King and Pope John Paul II.

He served as a trustee of the International Mission Board in the late 1950s and trustee of the SBC&#x27;s Radio and Television Commission in the late 1960s.

Graham deliberately reached into the secular world as a bridge builder. For example, as an entrepreneur he built his own pavilion for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. He appeared as a guest on a 1969 Woody Allen television special, in which he joined the comedian in a witty exchange on theological matters. During the Cold War, Graham became the first evangelist of note to speak behind the Iron Curtain, addressing large crowds in countries throughout Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, calling for peace. During the apartheid era, Graham consistently refused to visit South Africa until its government allowed integrated seating for audiences. During his first crusade there in 1973, he openly denounced apartheid. Graham also corresponded with imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela during the latter&#x27;s 27-year imprisonment.
In 1984, he led a series of summer meetings—Mission England—in the United Kingdom, and he used outdoor football (soccer) fields for his venues.

Graham was interested in fostering evangelism around the world. In 1983, 1986 and 2000 he sponsored, organized and paid for massive training conferences for Christian evangelists; this was, at the time, the largest representation of nations ever held. Over 157 nations were gathered in 2000 at the RAI Convention Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. At one revival in Seoul, South Korea, Graham attracted more than one million people to a single service. He appeared in China in 1988; for his wife, Ruth, this was a homecoming, since she had been born in China to missionary parents. He appeared in North Korea in 1992.

On October 15, 1989, Graham received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was the only person functioning as a minister who received a star in that capacity.

On September 22, 1991, Graham held his largest event in North America on the Great Lawn of Manhattan&#x27;s Central Park. City officials estimated that more than 250,000 were in attendance. In 1998, Graham spoke to a crowd of scientists and philosophers at the Technology, Entertainment, Design Conference.

On September 14, 2001 (only three days after the World Trade Center attacks), Graham was invited to lead a service at Washington National Cathedral; the service was attended by President George W. Bush and past and present leaders. He also spoke at the memorial service following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. On June 24–26, 2005, Graham began what he said would be his last North American crusade: three days at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in the borough of Queens, New York City. On the weekend of March 11–12, 2006, Graham held the &quot;Festival of Hope&quot; with his son, Franklin Graham. The festival was held in New Orleans, which was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.

Graham prepared one last sermon, &quot;My Hope America&quot;, which was released on DVD and played around America and possibly worldwide between November 7–10, 2013. November 7 was Graham&#x27;s 95th birthday, and he hoped to cause a revival.

==Later life==
Graham said that his planned retirement was a result of his failing health; he had suffered from hydrocephalus from 1992 on. In August 2005, Graham appeared at the groundbreaking for his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Then 86, he used a walker during the ceremony. On July 9, 2006, he spoke at the Metro Maryland Franklin Graham Festival, held in Baltimore, Maryland, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.

In April 2010, Graham was 91 and experiencing substantial vision, hearing, and balance loss when he made a rare public appearance at the re-dedication of the renovated Billy Graham Library.

There was controversy within his family over Graham&#x27;s proposed burial place. He announced in June 2007 that he and his wife would be buried alongside each other at the Billy Graham Library in his hometown of Charlotte. Graham&#x27;s younger son Ned argued with older son Franklin about whether burial at a library would be appropriate. Ruth Graham had said that she wanted to be buried in the mountains at the Billy Graham Training Center at The Cove near Asheville, North Carolina, where she had lived for many years; Ned supported his mother&#x27;s choice. Novelist Patricia Cornwell, a family friend, also opposed burial at the library, calling it a tourist attraction. Franklin wanted his parents to be buried at the library site. When Ruth Graham died, it was announced that they would be buried at the library site.

In 2011, when asked if he would have done things differently, he said he would have spent more time at home with his family, studied more, and preached less. Additionally, he said he would have participated in fewer conferences. He also said he had a habit of advising evangelists to save their time and avoid having too many commitments.

==Politics==
After his close relationships with Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, Graham tried to avoid explicit partisanship. Bailey says: &quot;He declined to sign or endorse political statements, and he distanced himself from the Christian right ... His early years of fierce opposition to communism gave way to pleas for military disarmament and attention to AIDS, poverty and environmental threats.&quot;

Graham was a lifelong registered member of the Democratic Party. In 1960, he opposed the candidacy of John F. Kennedy, fearing that Kennedy, as a Catholic, would be bound to follow the Pope. Graham worked &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to encourage influential Protestant ministers to speak out against Kennedy. During the 1960 campaign, Graham met with a conference of Protestant ministers in Montreux, Switzerland, to discuss their mobilization of congregations to defeat Kennedy. According to the PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; program, &quot;God in America&quot;, Graham organized a meeting of hundreds of Protestant ministers in Washington, D.C., in September 1960 for this purpose; the meeting was led by Norman Vincent Peale. This was shortly before Kennedy&#x27;s speech in Houston, Texas, on the separation of church and state; the speech was considered to be successful in meeting the concerns of many voters. After his election, Kennedy invited Graham to play golf in Palm Beach, Florida, after which Graham acknowledged Kennedy&#x27;s election as an opportunity for Catholics and Protestants to come closer together. After they had discussed Jesus Christ at that meeting, the two remained in touch, meeting for the last time at a National Day of Prayer meeting in February 1963. In his autobiography, Graham claimed to have felt an &quot;inner foreboding&quot; in the week before Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, and to have tried to contact him to say, &quot;Don&#x27;t go to Texas!&quot;

Graham opposed the large majority of abortions, but supported it as a legal option in a very narrow range of circumstances: rape, incest, and the life of the mother. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association states that &quot;Life is sacred, and we must seek to protect all human life: the unborn, the child, the adult, and the aged.&quot;

Graham leaned toward the Republicans during the presidency of Richard Nixon, whom he had met and befriended as vice president under Dwight D. Eisenhower. He did not completely ally himself with the later religious right, saying that Jesus did not have a political party. He gave his support to various political candidates over the years.

In 2007, Graham explained his refusal to join Jerry Falwell&#x27;s Moral Majority in 1979, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m for morality, but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the Panama Canal or superiority of armaments. Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle to preach to all people, right and left. I haven&#x27;t been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future.&quot;

According to a 2006 &quot;Newsweek&quot; interview, &quot;For Graham, politics is a secondary to the Gospel ... When &quot;Newsweek&quot; asked Graham whether ministers – whether they think of themselves as evangelists, pastors or a bit of both – should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: &#x27;You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I&#x27;m sure, but I think you have some – like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.&#x27;&quot;

In 2011, although grateful to have met politicians who have spiritual needs like everyone else, he said he sometimes crossed the line and would have preferred to avoid politics.

In 2012, Graham endorsed the Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. Shortly after, apparently to accommodate Romney, who is a Mormon, references to Mormonism as a religious cult (&quot;A cult is any group which teaches doctrines or beliefs that deviate from the biblical message of the Christian faith.&quot;) were removed from Graham&#x27;s website. Observers have questioned whether the support of Republican and religious right politics on issues such as same-sex marriage coming from Graham – who stopped speaking in public or to reporters – in fact reflects the views of his son, Franklin, head of the BGEA. Franklin denied this, and said that he would continue to act as his father&#x27;s spokesperson rather than allowing press conferences. In 2016, according to his son Franklin, Graham voted for Donald Trump. This statement has been disputed by other children and grandchildren of Billy Graham, who argue that he was too ill to vote (even absentee), and who reiterated that Billy Graham&#x27;s stated greatest regret in life was becoming involved in partisan politics.

===Pastor to presidents===


Graham had a personal audience with many sitting US presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama – 12 consecutive presidents. After meeting with Truman in 1950, Graham told the press he had urged the president to counter communism in North Korea. Truman disliked him and did not speak with him for years after that meeting. Later he always treated his conversations with presidents as confidential.

Truman made his contempt for Graham public. He wrote about Graham in his 1974 autobiography &quot;Plain Speaking&quot;: &quot;But now we&#x27;ve got just this one evangelist, this Billy Graham, and he&#x27;s gone off the beam. He&#x27;s ... well, I hadn&#x27;t ought to say this, but he&#x27;s one of those counterfeits I was telling you about. He claims he&#x27;s a friend of all the presidents, but he was never a friend of mine when I was President. I just don&#x27;t go for people like that. All he&#x27;s interested in is getting his name in the paper.&quot;

Graham became a regular visitor during the tenure of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He purportedly urged him to intervene with federal troops in the case of the Little Rock Nine to gain admission of black students to public schools. House Speaker Sam Rayburn persuaded Congress to allow Graham to conduct the first religious service on the steps of the Capitol building in 1952. Eisenhower asked for Graham while on his deathbed.

Graham met and became a close friend of Vice President Richard Nixon, and supported Nixon, a Quaker, for the 1960 presidential election. He convened an August strategy session of evangelical leaders in Montreux, Switzerland, to plan how best to oppose Nixon&#x27;s Roman Catholic opponent, Senator John F. Kennedy. Though a registered Democrat, Graham also maintained firm support of aggression against the foreign threat of communism and strongly sympathized with Nixon&#x27;s views regarding American foreign policy. Thus, he was more sympathetic to Republican administrations.

On December 16, 1963, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was impressed by the way Graham had praised the work of his great-grandfather, George Washington Baines, invited Graham to the White House to receive spiritual counseling. After this visit, Johnson frequently called on Graham for more spiritual counseling as well as companionship. As Graham recalled to his biographer Frady, &quot;I almost used the White House as a hotel when Johnson was President. He was always trying to keep me there. He just never wanted me to leave.&quot;

In contrast with his more limited access with Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy, Graham would not only visit the White House private quarters but would also at times kneel at Johnson&#x27;s bedside and pray with him whenever the President requested him to do so. Graham once recalled &quot;I have never had many people do that.&quot; In addition to his White House visits, Graham visited Johnson at Camp David and occasionally met with the President when he retreated to his private ranch in Stonewall, Texas. Johnson was also the first sitting president to attend one of Graham&#x27;s crusades, in Houston, Texas, in 1965.

During the 1964 United States presidential election, supporters of Republican nominee Barry Goldwater sent an estimated 2 million telegrams to Graham&#x27;s hometown of Montreat, North Carolina, and sought the preacher&#x27;s endorsement. Supportive of Johnson&#x27;s domestic policies, and hoping to preserve his friendship with the president, Graham resisted pressure to endorse Goldwater and stayed neutral in the election. Following Johnson&#x27;s election victory, Graham&#x27;s role as the main White House pastor was solidified. At one point, Johnson even considered making Graham a member of his cabinet and grooming him to be his successor, though Graham insisted he had no political ambitions and wished to remain a preacher. Graham&#x27;s biographer David Aikman acknowledged that the preacher was closer to Johnson than any other president he had ever known.

He spent the last night of Johnson&#x27;s presidency in the White House, and he stayed for the first night of Nixon&#x27;s. After Nixon&#x27;s victorious 1968 presidential campaign, Graham became an adviser, regularly visiting the White House and leading the president&#x27;s private worship services. In a meeting they had with Golda Meir, Nixon offered Graham the ambassadorship to Israel, but he declined the offer.

In 1970, Nixon appeared at a Graham revival in East Tennessee, which they thought safe politically. It drew one of the largest crowds in Tennessee of protesters against the Vietnam War. Nixon was the first president to give a speech from an evangelist&#x27;s platform. Their friendship became strained in 1973 when Graham rebuked Nixon for his post-Watergate behavior and the profanity heard on the Watergate tapes. They eventually reconciled after Nixon&#x27;s resignation.

Graham officiated at one presidential burial and one presidential funeral. He presided over the graveside services of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1973 and took part in eulogizing the former president. Graham officiated at the funeral services of former First Lady Pat Nixon in 1993, and the death and state funeral of Richard Nixon in 1994. During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Graham asserted that he believed President Bill Clinton to be &quot;a spiritual person&quot;. He was unable to attend the state funeral of Ronald Reagan on June 11, 2004, as he was recovering from hip replacement surgery. This was mentioned by George W. Bush in his eulogy.

On April 25, 2010, President Barack Obama visited Graham at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, where they &quot;had a private prayer&quot;.

===Relationship with Queen Elizabeth II===
Graham had a friendly relationship with Queen Elizabeth II and was frequently invited by the Royal Family to special events. They first met in 1955, and Graham preached at Windsor Chapel at the Queen&#x27;s invitation during the following year. Their friendly relationship may have been because they shared a traditional approach to the practical aspects of the Christian faith.

===Foreign policy views===
Graham was outspoken against communism and supported the American Cold War policy, including the Vietnam War. In a secret letter from April 15, 1969, made public twenty years later, Graham encouraged Nixon to bomb the dikes in North Vietnam if the peace talks in Paris should fail. This action would &quot;destroy the economy of North Vietnam&quot; and, by Nixon&#x27;s estimate, would have killed a million people.

In 1982, Graham preached in the Soviet Union and attended a wreath-laying ceremony to honor the war dead of World War II, when the Soviets were American allies in the fight against Nazism. He voiced fear of a second holocaust, not against Jews, but &quot;a nuclear holocaust&quot; and advised that &quot;our greatest contribution to world peace is to live with Christ every day.&quot;

In a 1999 speech, Graham discussed his relationship with the late North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, praising him as a &quot;different kind of communist&quot; and &quot;one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the Japanese&quot;. Graham went on to note that although he had never met Kim&#x27;s son and then-current North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, he had &quot;exchanged gifts with him&quot;.

==Controversial views==
===Discussion of Jews with President Nixon===
During the Watergate affair, there were suggestions that Graham had expressed antisemitic opinions in private discussions with Richard Nixon; he denied this, stressing his efforts to build bridges to the Jewish community. In 2002, the controversy was renewed when declassified &quot;Richard Nixon tapes&quot; confirmed remarks made by Graham to Nixon three decades earlier. Captured on the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that Jews control the American media, calling it a &quot;stranglehold&quot; during a 1972 conversation with Nixon, and suggesting that if Nixon was re-elected that they might be able to do something about it.

When the tapes were made public, Graham apologized and said, &quot;Although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made in an Oval Office conversation with President Nixon ... some 30 years ago. ... They do not reflect my views and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks.&quot; According to &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, &quot;[T]he shock of the revelation was magnified because of Graham&#x27;s longtime support of Israel and his refusal to join in calls for conversion of the Jews.&quot;

In 2009, more Nixon tapes were released, in which Graham is heard in a 1973 conversation with Nixon referring to a group of Jewish journalists as &quot;the synagogue of Satan&quot;. A spokesman for Graham said that Graham has never been an antisemite and that the comparison (in accord with the context of the quotation in the Book of Revelation) was directed specifically at those claiming to be Jews, but not holding to traditional Jewish values.

===Ecumenism===
After a 1957 crusade in New York, some more fundamentalist Protestant Christians criticized Graham for his ecumenism, even calling him &quot;Antichrist&quot;.

Graham expressed inclusivist views, suggesting that people without explicit faith in Jesus can be saved. In a 1997 interview with Robert Schuller, Graham said:

Iain Murray, writing from a conservative Protestant standpoint, argues that &quot;Graham&#x27;s concessions are sad words from one who once spoke on the basis of biblical certainties.&quot;
===Views on women===
In 1970, Graham stated that feminism was &quot;an echo of our overall philosophy of permissiveness&quot; and that women did not want to be &quot;competitive juggernauts pitted against male chauvinists&quot;. He further stated that the role of wife, mother, and homemaker was the destiny of &quot;real womanhood&quot; according to the Judeo-Christian ethic. Graham&#x27;s assertions, published in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, elicited letters of protest, and were offered as rebuttal to the establishment of &quot;The New Feminism&quot; section of the publication that had been added following a sit-in protest at the &quot;Journal&quot; offices demanding female representation on the staff of the publication.

Graham&#x27;s daughter Bunny recounted her father denying her and her sisters higher education. As reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;:

Bunny remembers being groomed for the life of wife, homemaker, and mother. &quot;There was never an idea of a career for us&quot;, she said. &quot;I wanted to go to nursing school – Wheaton had a five-year program – but Daddy said no. No reason, no explanation, just &#x27;No.&#x27; It wasn&#x27;t confrontational and he wasn&#x27;t angry, but when he decided, that was the end of it.&quot; She added, &quot;He has forgotten that. Mother has not.&quot;

Graham&#x27;s daughter Anne is a Christian minister, leading a Christian ministry organization known as AnGeL Ministries.

Graham talked his future wife, Ruth, into abandoning her ambition to evangelize in Tibet in favor of staying in the United States to marry him – and that to do otherwise would be &quot;to thwart God&#x27;s obvious will&quot;. After Ruth agreed to marry him, Graham cited the Bible for claiming authority over her, saying, &quot;then I&#x27;ll do the leading and you do the following&quot;. According to her obituary, Ruth was active in Christian ministry after they married, often teaching Sunday School. Her obituary states that in addition to his two sons, all three of Graham&#x27;s daughters would become Christian ministers as well.

===Views on homosexuality===
Graham regarded homosexuality as a sin, and in 1974 described it as &quot;a sinister form of perversion&quot;. In 1993, he said that he thought AIDS might be a &quot;judgment&quot; from God, but two weeks later he retracted the remark, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that, and I don&#x27;t know why I said it.&quot; Graham opposed same-sex marriage, stating that &quot;I believe the home and marriage is the foundation of our society and must be protected.&quot; Graham&#x27;s obituary noted that his stated position was that he did not want to talk about homosexuality as a political issue. Corky Siemaszko, writing for NBC News, noted that after the 1993 incident, Graham &quot;largely steered clear of the subject&quot;. However, Graham appeared to take a more tolerant approach to the issue of homosexuality when he appeared on the May 2, 1997, episode of &quot;20/20&quot;, stating &quot;I think that the Bible teaches that homosexuality is a sin, but the Bible also teaches that pride is a sin, jealously is a sin, and hate is a sin, evil thoughts are a sin, and so I don&#x27;t think that homosexuality should be chosen as the overwhelming sin that we are doing today.&quot;

In 2012, Graham and his son, Franklin, publicly endorsed North Carolina Amendment 1, a measure to ban same-sex marriage in the state. They both condemned President Obama&#x27;s public declaration of support for same-sex marriage later that year.

==Awards and honors==
Graham was frequently honored by surveys, including &quot;Greatest Living American&quot;, and consistently ranked among the most admired persons in the United States and the world. He appeared most frequently on Gallup&#x27;s list of most admired people. On the day of his death, Graham had been on Gallup&#x27;s Top 10 &quot;Most Admired Man&quot; list 61 times, and held the highest rank of any person since the list began in 1948.

In 1967, he was the first Protestant to receive an honorary degree from Belmont Abbey College, a Roman Catholic school. In 1983, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US President Ronald Reagan.

Graham received the Big Brother of the Year Award for his work on behalf of children. He was cited by the George Washington Carver Memorial Institute for his contributions to race relations. He received the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion and the Sylvanus Thayer Award for his commitment to &quot;Duty, Honor, Country&quot;. The &quot;Billy Graham Children&#x27;s Health Center&quot; in Asheville is named after and funded by Graham.

In 1999, the Gospel Music Association inducted Graham into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame to recognize his contributions to Christian music artists such as Michael W. Smith, dc Talk, Amy Grant, Jars of Clay, and others who performed at the Billy Graham Crusades. Graham was the first non-musician inducted, and had also helped to revitalize interest in hymns and create new favorite songs. Singer Michael W. Smith was active in Billy Graham Crusades as well as Samaritan&#x27;s Purse. Smith sang &quot;Just As I Am&quot; in a tribute to Graham at the 44th GMA Dove Awards. He also sang it at the memorial service honoring Graham at the United States Capitol rotunda on February 28, 2018.

In 2000, former First Lady Nancy Reagan presented the Ronald Reagan Freedom Award to Graham. Graham was a friend of the Reagans for years.

In 2001, Queen Elizabeth II awarded him an honorary knighthood. The honor was presented to him by Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US at the British Embassy in Washington DC on December 6, 2001.

A professorial chair is named after him at the Alabama Baptist-affiliated Samford University, the Billy Graham Professor of Evangelism and Church Growth. His &quot;alma mater&quot;, Wheaton College, has an archive of his papers at the Billy Graham Center. The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary has the Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism and Ministry. Graham received 20 honorary degrees and refused at least that many more. In San Francisco, California, the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium is sometimes erroneously called the &quot;Billy Graham Civic Auditorium&quot; and incorrectly considered to be named in his honor, but it is actually named after the rock and roll promoter Bill Graham.

On May 31, 2007, the $27 million Billy Graham Library was officially dedicated in Charlotte. Former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton appeared to celebrate with Graham. A highway in Charlotte bears Graham&#x27;s name, as does I-240 near Graham&#x27;s home in Asheville.

As Graham&#x27;s final crusade approached in 2005, his friend Pat Boone chose to create a song in honor of Graham, which he co-wrote and produced with David Pack and Billy Dean, who digitally combined studio recordings of various artists into what has been called a &quot;&#x27;We Are the World&#x27;-type&quot; production. Titled &quot;Thank You Billy Graham&quot;, the song&#x27;s video was introduced by Bono, and included Faith Hill, MxPx, John Ford Coley, John Elefante, Mike Herrera, Michael McDonald, Jeffrey Osborne, LeAnn Rimes, Kenny Rogers, Connie Smith, Michael Tait, and other singers, with brief narration by Larry King. It was directed by Brian Lockwood, as a tribute album. In 2013, the album &quot;My Hope: Songs Inspired by the Message and Mission of Billy Graham&quot; was recorded by Amy Grant, Kari Jobe, Newsboys, Matthew West, tobyMac, and other music artists with new songs to honor Graham during his &quot;My Hope America with Billy Graham&quot; outreach and the publication of his book &quot;The Reason for My Hope: Salvation&quot;. Other songs written to honor Graham include &quot;Hero of the Faith&quot; written by Eddie Carswell of NewSong, which became a hit, &quot;Billy, You&#x27;re My Hero&quot; by Greg Hitchcock, &quot;Billy Graham&quot; by The Swirling Eddies, &quot;Billy Graham&#x27;s Bible&quot; by Joe Nichols, &quot;Billy Frank&quot; by Randy Stonehill, and an original song titled &quot;Just as I Am&quot; by Fernando Ortega.

The movie &quot;&quot; officially premiered in theaters on October 10, 2008, less than one month before Graham&#x27;s 90th birthday. Graham did not comment on the film, but his son Franklin released a critical statement on August 18, 2008, noting that the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association &quot;has not collaborated with nor does it endorse the movie&quot;. Graham&#x27;s eldest daughter, Gigi, praised the film and was hired as a consultant to help promote it.

==Personal life==
=== Family ===
On August 13, 1943, Graham married Wheaton classmate Ruth Bell, whose parents were Presbyterian missionaries in China. Her father, L. Nelson Bell, was a general surgeon. Ruth died on June 14, 2007, at age 87. The couple were married for almost 64 years.

Graham and his wife had five children together. Virginia (Gigi) Leftwich Graham Tchividjian (b. 1945), an inspirational speaker and author; Anne Graham Lotz (b. 1948), leader of AnGeL ministries; Ruth Graham (b. 1950), founder and president of Ruth Graham &amp; Friends and leader of conferences throughout the US and Canada; Franklin Graham (b. 1952), president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and president and CEO of international relief organization Samaritan&#x27;s Purse; and Nelson Edman Graham (b. 1958), a pastor who runs East Gates Ministries International, which distributes Christian literature in China.

At the time of his death at age 99 in 2018, Graham was survived by 5 children, 19 grandchildren (including Tullian Tchividjian and Will Graham), 41 great-grandchildren, and 6 great-great-grandchildren.

=== Church ===
In 1953, he became a member of the First Baptist Church Dallas, although he never lived in the state of Texas. In 2008, he changed his membership to the First Baptist Church of Spartanburg, South Carolina, about a 1.5-hour drive from his home in Montreat, North Carolina.

==Death==

Graham died of natural causes on February 21, 2018, at his home in Montreat, North Carolina, at the age of 99.

On February 28 and March 1, 2018, Graham became the fourth private citizen in United States history to lie in honor at the United States Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C. He is the first religious leader to be so honored. At the ceremony, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called Graham &quot;America&#x27;s pastor&quot;. President Donald Trump said Graham was &quot;an ambassador for Christ&quot;. In addition, televangelist Jim Bakker paid respect to Graham, stating he was the greatest preacher since Jesus. He also said that Graham visited him in prison.

A private funeral service was held on March 2, 2018. Graham was buried beside his wife at the foot of the cross-shaped brick walkway in the Prayer Garden, on the northeast side of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina. Graham&#x27;s pine plywood casket was handcrafted in 2006 by convicted murderers at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, and topped with a wooden cross that was nailed to it by the prisoners.

He is honored with a commemoration on the liturgical calendar of the Anglican Church in North America on February 21.

On May 16, 2024, a bronze statue of Graham was unveiled in the U.S. Capitol by House Speaker Mike Johnson.

<doc id="690868" wikidata="Q1138393" url="?curid=690868" title="Rio Grande (1950 film)">
<text>Rio Grande is a 1950 American romantic Western film directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara. It is the third installment of Ford&#x27;s &quot;Cavalry Trilogy&quot;, following two RKO Pictures releases: &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948) and &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; (1949). Wayne plays the lead in all three films, as Captain Kirby York in &quot;Fort Apache&quot;, then as Captain Nathan Brittles in &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot;, and finally as a promoted Lieutenant Colonel Kirby Yorke in &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. &quot;Rio Grande&quot;&#x27;s supporting cast features Ben Johnson, Claude Jarman Jr., Harry Carey Jr., Chill Wills, J. Carrol Naish, Victor McLaglen, Grant Withers, the Western singing group the Sons of the Pioneers and Stan Jones.

In the film, Yorke leads a cavalry regiment at the border of Texas and Mexico. He has been estranged from his wife Kathleen and son Jeff for the last fifteen years. Jeff recently flunked out of West Point and enlisted in the Army as a private. He comes under Yorke&#x27;s command, where Yorke promises not to give him special treatment. Kathleen soon arrives at the fort, trying unsuccessfully to get Jeff to return to military school. As Kathleen and Yorke deal with their son, their relationship revives. Meanwhile, Apaches have been attacking the fort and taking refuge in Mexico so that Yorke&#x27;s regiment can&#x27;t retaliate against them. After an attack on the fort&#x27;s women and children where the children are kidnapped, Yorke pursues Apache raiders into Mexico and raids their villages with permission from his general. He saves the kidnapped children, and returns to Kathleen settling into her role as military wife on the fort.

While originally Ford was uninterested in directing another Western, his studio wouldn&#x27;t permit him to start &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; until he directed &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. The script was based on a short story by James Warner Bellah, which was inspired by historical events. The film was shot in only 32 days in Monument Valley, Utah. After its release, it made a modest profit, with reviewers praising the music and the action, but noting that the themes were well-worn. Later reviews praised the natural beauty of the shooting location, but were mixed about its efficacy. The film can be read as anticipating the frustration with international borders the US military would experience in the Vietnam War, with the solution to ignore international borders reflecting the conservative politics of Bellah and scriptwriter James Kevin McGuinness. The film is one of the least sympathetic of Ford&#x27;s Westerns to Native Americans, depicting them as bloodthirsty and villainous. In contrast to its one-sided portrayal of Native Americans, its treatment of the reconciliation of an estranged couple and their son is emotionally complex. &quot;Rio Grande&quot; also addresses issues of class, showing a rejection of class privilege common in Ford&#x27;s work.

==Plot==
In the summer of 1879, Lieutenant Colonel Kirby Yorke is posted on the Texas frontier in command of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry Regiment to defend settlers against attacks by marauding Apaches. Yorke has just captured the Apache&#x27;s leader. Apaches have been using Mexico as a sanctuary from pursuit, and the regiment is suffering from a serious shortage of troops. 

Yorke has been estranged from his wife and son for 15 years, after he set fire to his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s plantation in the South under orders from his commanding officer during the Shenandoah Valley campaign of the American Civil War. Yorke&#x27;s son, Trooper Jefferson (Jeff) Yorke, is one of 18 recruits sent to the regiment. After failing mathematics and flunking out of West Point, he immediately enlisted as a private in the Army. In a meeting with his father, Yorke informs him that he will receive no special treatment in the brutal way of life he has chosen; Jeff declares he wants none. Through his willingness to undergo any test or trial, Jeff befriends Travis Tyree and Daniel &quot;Sandy&quot; Boone. Tyree is on the run from the law for killing a man, but wants to wait to go to trial until after his sister&#x27;s wedding. Yorke&#x27;s estranged wife, Kathleen, arrives unexpectedly to buy the underage Jeff out of his enlistment. In a showdown with his mother, Jeff refuses her attempt to buy him out of the Army. The struggle over their son&#x27;s future rekindles the romance the couple once felt for each other.

The Apaches attack the fort one night. Many of them are killed by the awakened troopers, but they succeed in freeing their leader. When Yorke&#x27;s patrol reaches the Rio Grande, too late to capture the Apaches he was following, he meets a Mexican patrol. They exchange cordialities and both confirm that the US troops cannot cross into Mexico. Yorke is visited by his former Civil War commander, Philip Sheridan, now Commanding General of the Military Division of the Missouri, the headquarters responsible for pacifying the Great Plains. Sheridan has decided to order Yorke to cross the Rio Grande into Mexico in pursuit of the Apaches and kill them all, an action with serious political implications. Sheridan promises that if Yorke draws a court-martial as a result of the orders Sheridan legally cannot give him, he will ensure that the members of the court will be his fellow soldiers from the Civil War. Yorke accepts the assignment.

Before Yorke leads his men toward Mexico, he sends the women and children to Ft. Bliss for safety, with an escort including Jeff. Jeff and Boone meet Tyree, who has gone Absent Without Leave to evade a Texas marshal who is looking for him. Tyree informs them that there are Apaches in the area. The Apaches attack the wagons and capture the one carrying the children and Corporal Bell&#x27;s wife. The braves kill some of the escorting cavalry. While the remainder fends off the Apaches, Jeff returns to the fort for reinforcements. Tyree saves him from an Apache attack on the way. 

The Second meets the survivors of the escort and follows the Apache raiders. They discover the burnt-out wagon and the body of Corporal Bell&#x27;s wife, but there is no sign of the children. In the meantime, Tyree rejoins the regiment and tells them he trailed the Apaches to their hideout in Mexico. Working with Tyree, Yorke permits three troopers, Tyree, Boone, and Jeff, to infiltrate the village where the Apaches have taken the children. Then Yorke leads his regiment in an all-out attack. The cavalrymen rescue all of the children unharmed, though Colonel Yorke is wounded by an arrow that he orders Jeff to remove. He is taken back to the fort by his victorious troops, where Kathleen meets him and holds his hand as he is carried on a travois into the post.

After Colonel Yorke recovers, Troopers Tyree, Boone, Jeff, Corporal Bell, and Indian Scout Son of Many Mules are decorated. At the ceremony, when one of the Texas marshals reappears Trooper Tyree continues his run from the law, stealing General Sheridan&#x27;s horse for the purpose. As the troops pass in review, the regimental band plays &quot;Dixie&quot; at the General&#x27;s request, apparently to please Mrs. Yorke.

== Cast ==

==Production==
===Background===
With the completion of &quot;Wagon Master&quot;, Ford did not want to make another Western. Instead, he wanted to film the Ireland-set romantic comedy-drama film &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; with Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, but Herbert Yates, the studio president of Republic Pictures, insisted that Ford first make &quot;Rio Grande&quot; with the same pairing of Wayne and O&#x27;Hara because he thought the script of &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; was weak and that the story was of little general interest. Yates insisted that &quot;Rio Grande&quot; be made before &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;, to offset the anticipated losses on that film. When &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; was eventually released in 1952, though, it vastly out-performed &quot;Rio Grande&quot; by grossing $3.8 million in its first year and giving Yates and Republic Pictures one of the top-10 hits of the year. 

===Writing===
The script for &quot;Rio Grande&quot; was written by Irish-born screenwriter James Kevin McGuinness. It is based on a short story &quot;Mission With No Record&quot; by James Bellah that appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; on September 27, 1947. McGuinness had been working at MGM as a story editor, and either resigned or was fired for his extremely conservative politics. Patrick Ford, John Ford&#x27;s son, reported that many of the long speeches that McGuinness included in his script were cut in the final filming, and that many scenes were improvised. McGuinness based his story on a specific raid by the 4th Cavalry Regiment (United States) in May 1873. Colonel Ranald Mackenzie, under orders from General Phil Sheridan, crossed the border to fight Kickapoo people, and kidnapped some of their women and children to hold as hostages. This was illegal, and the Mexican government protested. McGuinness made several changes to the original story on Ford&#x27;s request. He made the main character more sympathetic and less ruthless. There are also differences between the film and the historical events. In the film, Apache kidnap white American women and children, but in the historical event, members of the 4th Cavalry regiment kidnapped Kickapoo women and children. In the film, the Mexican officer seems relieved that Yorke helped to kill Native Americans; in the historical event, the Mexican government protested the raid as a violation of their international border.

During filming, the film was called &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and then &quot;Rio Grande Command&quot; until right before release.

===Casting===
Skilled stuntman and rodeo star Ben Johnson played his third credited role in &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. The stunt where he rides two horses &quot;Roman style&quot;, standing on the backs of two separate horses, took three weeks to master.

&quot;Rio Grande&quot; was the first of three films directed by Ford starring the pairing of John Wayne and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, followed by &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; in 1952 and &quot;The Wings of Eagles&quot; in 1957. Wayne and O&#x27;Hara also starred together in &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963) and &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971). 

===Filming===
The film was shot entirely on location in Monument Valley near Moab, Utah. Archie Stout was the second-unit director and Bert Glennon also helped with cinematography.
O&#x27;Hara recalled that the weather was so hot that production crew dug a pit covered by a tarp to have a cooler resting place.

The location shoot, which Harry Carey described as a &quot;vacation&quot; picture, was shot in just 32 days, with 665 takes of 646 setups. O&#x27;Hara recalled that Ford insulted and belittled Wayne frequently on set. While those who knew Ford were accustomed to his abusive behavior, Claude Jarman, another newcomer to the Ford set, felt like the cast was scared and &quot;you never knew what [Ford] was going to do.&quot; 

Ford wanted the military aspects of the film to be realistic. The film uses the conical Sibley tents that were used then, as well as Primus stoves. Actors were not permitted to wash their cavalry uniforms to ensure that they looked dusty and lived-in.

===Music===
The film contains folk songs led by the Sons of the Pioneers, one of whom is Ken Curtis (Ford&#x27;s future son-in-law). Studio president Yates insisted that the group appear in the film. Ford disliked being forced to use them, and how they appeared incongruous with cavalrymen. Victor Young wrote the score. On the music, Ford biographer and film critic Scott Eyman said there was too much of it, but that it &quot;gives the film an air of plaintive longing.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Rio Grande&quot; cost 1.2 million dollars to make, and earned 2 million dollars. Its net profit was $215,634. A review by &quot;New York Times&quot; described it as a &quot;familiar story&quot; that &quot;travels a well-rutted road&quot; but that &quot;the horsemanship never was better&quot;. It was also noted for its similarities to the 1935 epic-adventure film &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot;. Praise was given, though, for the Western-style ballads sung by the Sons of the Pioneers. William Brogdon at &quot;Variety&quot; summarized the film as &quot;big brawling mass action clashes, mixed together with a substantial portion of good, honest sentiment&quot; which predict box office success.

Garry Wills&#x27;s 1997 book, &quot;John Wayne&#x27;s America&quot;, called &quot;Rio Grande&quot; the &quot;most beautifully filmed&quot; of the Cavalry trilogy. He attributed this to the landscape in Moab, the sensitivity of the cinematographers, and intimate tent scenes that emphasize emotion on actors&#x27; faces. In a 2017 book on Wayne and Ford&#x27;s films and friendship, Nancy Schoenberger conceded that Ford considered &quot;Rio Grande&quot; a &quot;throwaway&quot; film and that critics consider it the weakest of the Cavalry trilogy. Schoenberger wrote that the film &quot;may be the most beautiful and most compelling&quot; because of its setting. Eyman wrote that the film &quot;lacks the depth of feeling Ford infused into the other two cavalry pictures,&quot; possibly because he wasn&#x27;t passionate about creating the film and saw it as an obstacle to surmount before starting on &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;.

==Themes==
===Political and racial===
While films about the British Empire had been popular in the 1930s, they often featured military conflict with colonized people. After World War II started, the Office of War Information discouraged British Empire films about India, because the United States needed their help in the war, and films sympathetic to the British could have alienated India. For this and other reasons, Westerns became even more popular in the 1940s. For Richard Slotkin, Westerns like &quot;Rio Grande&quot; produced after World War II were a way to transfer &quot;the ideological concerns&quot; of the war &quot;to the mythic landscape of the Western.&quot; In contrast to earlier Westerns, which emphasized a lone ranger, Slotkin described Yorke&#x27;s leadership style as &quot;professionally irregular&quot;: enforcing discipline and the chain of command while adapting to the changing needs of war.

In a biography of John Wayne, authors Randy Roberts and James S. Olson analyze the success of &quot;Rio Grande&quot;, alluding to consensus that it was the weakest film in the cavalry trilogy. They related the film&#x27;s central conflict of &quot;the frustration of diplomatic niceties and the untenable nature of borders&quot; to the beginning of the Korean War, which involved American soldiers defending against Chinese attackers in North Korea. In the film, the frustration is resolved by attacking Apaches in Mexico. Roberts and Olson wrote that this solution reflected the conservative politics of Bellah and McGuinness, who believed that America&#x27;s enemies who kill innocent people should be pursued into neutral countries if they take refuge there. In a book on Ford, Wayne, and Ward Bond, Scott Allen Nollen also noticed that &quot;Rio Grande&quot;&#x27;s &quot;reactionary attitude toward Apaches as simplistic savages reflect[ed]&quot; the &quot;arch-conservative&quot; views of McGuinness. In a biography of John Ford, Joseph McBride saw &quot;Rio Grande&quot; as an &quot;early-warning allegory of the Korean War&quot; that expressed Ford&#x27;s &quot;anti-Communist feelings&quot;. Richard Slotkin, in his book on the frontier myth in America, also noticed anti-Communist parallels. He wrote that the river in &quot;Rio Grande&quot; is &quot;a Yalu or Iron Curtain, which can only be crossed in arms for battles of rescue and/or annihilation.&quot;

The depiction of Native Americans in &quot;Rio Grande&quot; was very negative. Frank Nugent had previously written scripts for Ford&#x27;s westerns, and his treatment of Native Americans was sympathetic. McGuinness, in contrast, was not. Joseph Breen, acting under the Production Code Administration, said the script was &quot;blatantly racist&quot; and asked the producers to cut some of the more egregious lines, which they did. While the description of the Apache as &quot;a scourge&quot; was purged, the violent actions of the Apache remained in the film. The bodies of the victims are not shown on-screen, allowing viewers to assume the worst. Filmmaker Kathleen McDonough believed that the negative depiction of Native Americans showed a diminished hope for world peace after World War II. The theme of &quot;becoming savage in order to defeat savages&quot; anticipated a common conflict in films about the Vietnam War.

===Masculinity and family relationships===
&quot;Rio Grande&quot;, while a western, involves family drama, which is unusual in a genre associated with male friendship and mobility. Russell Meeuf, a journalism professor at the University of Idaho, wrote on 1950s masculinity in the Cavalry trilogy. McBride called it Ford&#x27;s first &quot;mature love story,&quot; where the &quot;emotionally complex family drama [...] elevat[es] &quot;Rio Grande&quot; above its crudely racist and stridently jingoistic military plot.&quot; For Classical Hollywood film scholars Gaylyn Studlar and Matthew Bernstein, the emotional theme for both Kathleen and Yorke is that they &quot;must confront and resolve the tension between the demands of duty and the love of family.&quot; Ultimately, to survive on the frontier, a man needs not just endurance, but also &quot;the comfort of family.&quot; 

McBride saw Ford&#x27;s sensitive treatment of Jeff as a possible sign of &quot;self-recrimination over his coldhearted treatment of Pat&quot; (Ford&#x27;s own son). The ending of the film shows Kathleen performing household chores and waiting with the other wives to show that she is returning to stay with Yorke, which McBride calls &quot;emotionally compelling despite its (qualified) sexism.&quot; When Yorke returns, injured on a stretcher, Kathleen publicly walks alongside him, holding his hand, making her decision to stay with him one that includes the entire fort community, where women share in suffering while their husbands fight. While Kathleen&#x27;s role is limited, she still represents a greater feminine presence than in many other westerns, such as those by Howard Hawks, Anthony Mann, or John Sturges. 

&quot;Rio Grande&quot;&#x27;s western family drama shows, for Meeuf, &quot;the dynamic tensions of the balance between masculine adventurism and a settled domestic existence&quot;. Schoenberger noticed that the relationship between Yorke and his abandoned son Jeff was characterized by on-screen pain. Yorke allows a fistfight between Jeff and a stronger man to continue so Jeff can try to prove himself. Later, when Yorke is shot by an Apache arrow, he asks Jeff to take it out, &quot;a feat that takes physical strength and an unflinching ability to inflict pain on a loved one in order to save his life.&quot;

===Class===
Meeuf also looks at the treatment of class in the Cavalry trilogy. Kathleen initially wants to take her son back home with her so that he can be tutored in mathematics (the subject he failed) and return to West Point, where he can get a commission as an officer. This represents her expectations for her son as an upper-class woman. Yorke calls this attitude &quot;special privilege for special born,&quot; and he prefers that their son Jeff work his way up from an enlisted officer by proving himself as a man and soldier. Kathleen yields to his preference, although for Meeuf, this &quot;borders on the far-fetched.&quot; Still, the rejection of class privilege for the adventure of life in the West is a common theme in Ford&#x27;s work. For Wills, Kathleen represented lingering unrest from the Civil War, whose resentment faded as she saw the man who ordered her family home to be burned during the Civil War take part in the fort&#x27;s society. Tyree, also a southerner, demonstrated collaboration with northerners.

==Accolades==
The film was recognized by the American Film Institute in 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10: Nominated Western film. It was one of 50 films nominated for the top 10 best Westerns.

<doc id="690870" wikidata="Q2096864" url="?curid=690870" title="Progressive Federal Party">
<text>The Progressive Federal Party (PFP) () was a South African political party formed in 1977 through merger of the Progressive and Reform parties, eventually changing its name to the Progressive Federal Party. For its duration, it was the main parliamentary opposition to apartheid, instead advocating power-sharing in South Africa through a federal constitution. From the 1977 election until 1987 it was the official opposition of the country.

Its first leader was Colin Eglin, who was succeeded by Frederik van Zyl Slabbert and then Zach de Beer. Another prominent member was Harry Schwarz who had led the Reform Party and was the chairman of the Federal Executive (1976–79), finance spokesman (1975–91) and defence spokesman (1975–84). He was regarded as the PFP&#x27;s greatest parliamentary performer. Its best known parliamentarian was however Helen Suzman, who was for many years the only member of the whites-only House of Assembly to speak out unequivocally against the apartheid regime.

== Formation ==

The party was preceded by the Progressive Party as the liberal opposition to the National Party. While the main opposition United Party contained liberal factions, the PP had for many years been the only purely liberal party represented in parliament. A realignment began when liberal members of the UP left to found the Reform Party in 1975, which merged with the Progressives to form the Progressive Reform Party later the same year.

In 1977, another group of United Party members left the by then rapidly declining party to form the Committee for a United Opposition, which then joined the Progressive Reform Party to form the Progressive Federal Party.

== History ==

South Africa&#x27;s apartheid laws initially limited the party&#x27;s membership to the country&#x27;s whites, from which it drew support mainly from liberal English speakers. It opened up its membership to all races as soon as this became legal again, in 1984, but the party remained predominantly white and English. It won seats in cities such as Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg and Durban. It had very little support amongst Afrikaners, and the PFP was derided by right-wing whites, who claimed its initials stood for &#x27;Packing for Perth&#x27;, because of the many white liberal supporters of the &#x27;Progs&#x27;, who were emigrating to Australia.

The PFP would become the official opposition in the 1977 election, winning 17 seats. Colin Eglin, who had also led the earlier Progressive Party, was initially the leader of the PFP. But over the weekend of 3 September 1979, on the behest of Gordon Waddell, the PFP would hold a special congress in Johannesburg to elect a new leader, citing such reasons as Eglin&#x27;s &quot;uninspired&quot; parliamentary performance, which allowed the ruling Nationalists to recover from the Muldergate slush fund scandal; his &quot;indiscreet&quot; contacts with black US politicians Don McHenry and Andy Young, whom many South Africans regarded as enemies of the country; and the party&#x27;s severe defeats in three recent Parliamentary by-elections. Frederik van Zyl Slabbert succeeded Eglin in 1979.

The PFP strengthened its opposition status in 1981 by increasing its representation to 27 seats.

It was ousted as the official opposition by the far-right Conservative Party in the whites-only parliamentary elections held on 6 May 1987.

This electoral blow led many of the PFP&#x27;s leaders to question the value of participating in the whites-only parliament, and some of its MPs left to form the New Democratic Movement (NDM).

In 1989, the PFP and NDM merged with another small white reformist party, the Independent Party (IP), to form the Democratic Party (DP).

<doc id="690874" wikidata="Q6787867" url="?curid=690874" title="Matrix decoder">
<text>Matrix decoding is an audio technology where a small number of discrete audio channels (e.g., 2) are decoded into a larger number of channels on play back (e.g., 5). The channels are generally, but not always, arranged for transmission or recording by an encoder, and decoded for playback by a decoder. The function is to allow multichannel audio, such as quadraphonic sound or surround sound to be encoded in a stereo signal, and thus played back as stereo on stereo equipment, and as surround on surround equipment – this is &quot;compatible&quot; multichannel audio.

== Process ==
Matrix encoding does &quot;not&quot; allow one to encode several channels in &quot;fewer&quot; channels without losing information: one cannot fit 5 channels into 2 (or even 3 into 2) without losing information, as this loses dimensions: the decoded signals are not independent. The idea is rather to encode something that will both be an acceptable approximation of the surround sound when decoded, and acceptable (or even superior) stereo.

== Notation ==
The notation for matrix encoding consists of the number of original discrete audio channels separated by a colon from the number of encoded and decoded channels. For example, four channels encoded into two discrete channels and decoded back to four-channels would be notated:

 4:2:4

Some methods derive new channels from the existing ones, with no special encoding of the audio source. For example, five discrete channels decoded to six channels would be notated:

 5:5:6

Such derived channel &quot;decoders&quot; may take advantage of the Haas effect, as well as audio cues inherent in the source channels.

Many matrix encoding methods have been developed:

==Hafler circuit (2:2:4) ==

The earliest and simpler form of decoding is the Hafler circuit, deriving back channels out of normal stereo recording (2:2:4). It was used for decoding only (encoding sound was not considered).

===Decoding matrix===
==Dynaquad matrix (2:2:4) / (4:2:4) ==

The Dynaquad matrix introduced in 1969 was based on the Hafler circuit, but also used for a specific encoding of 4 sound channels in some albums (4:2:4).

===Encoding matrix===
===Decoding matrix===
==Electro-Voice Stereo-4 matrix (2:2:4) / (4:2:4) ==

The Stereo-4 matrix was invented by Leonard Feldman and Jon Fixler, introduced in 1970, and sold by Electro-Voice and Radio Shack. This matrix was used to encode 4 sound channels on many record albums (4:2:4).

===Encoding matrix===
===Decoding matrix===
== SQ matrix, &quot;Stereo Quadraphonic&quot;, CBS SQ (4:2:4) ==
&quot;formula_1 phase-shift, formula_2 phase-shift&quot;

The basic SQ matrix had mono/stereo anomalies as well as encoding/decoding problems, heavily criticized by Michael Gerzon and others.

An attempt to improve the system lead to the use of other encoders or sound capture techniques, yet the decoding matrix remained unchanged.

=== Position Encoder ===
An N/2 encoder that encoded every position in a 360° circle - it had 16 inputs and each could be dialed to the exact direction desired, generating an optimized encode.

=== Forward-Oriented encoder ===

&quot;formula_1 phase-shift, formula_2 phase-shift&quot;

The Forward-Oriented encoder caused Center Back to be encoded as Center Front and was recommended for live broadcast use for maximum mono compatibility - it also encoded Center Left/Center Right and both diagonal splits in the optimal manner.
Could be used to modify existing 2-channel stereo recordings and create &#x27;synthesized SQ&#x27; that when played through a Full-Logic or Tate DES SQ decoder, exhibited a 180° or 270° synthesized quad effect. Many stereo FM radio stations broadcasting SQ in the 1970s used their Forward-Oriented SQ encoder for this. For SQ &quot;decoders&quot;, CBS designed a circuit that produced the 270° enhancement using the 90° phase shifters in the decoder. Sansui&#x27;s QS Encoders and QS Vario-Matrix Decoders had a similar capability.

=== Backwards-Oriented encoder ===

&quot;formula_1 phase-shift, formula_2 phase-shift&quot;

The Backwards-Oriented Encoder was the reverse of the Forward-Oriented Encoder - it allowed sounds to be placed optimally in the back half of the room, but mono-compatibility was sacrificed.
When used with standard stereo recordings it created &quot;extra wide&quot; stereo with sounds outside the speakers.

Some encoding mixers had channel strips switchable between forward-oriented and backwards-oriented encoding.

=== London Box ===
It encoded the Center Back in such a way that it didn&#x27;t cancel in mono playback, thus its output was usually mixed with that of a Position Encoder or a Forward Oriented encoder. After 1972, the vast majority of SQ Encoded albums were mixed with either the Position Encoder or the Forward-Oriented encoder.

=== Ghent microphone ===
In addition, CBS created the SQ Ghent Microphone, which was a spatial microphone system using the Neumann QM-69 mic. The signals from the QM-69 were differenced, and then phase-matrixed into 2-channel SQ.
With the Ghent Microphone, SQ was transformed from a Matrix into a Kernel and an additional signal could be derived to provide N:3:4 performance.

=== Universal SQ ===
In 1976, Ben Bauer integrated matrix and discrete systems into USQ, or Universal SQ.
It was a hierarchical 4-4-4 discrete matrix that used the SQ matrix as the baseband for discrete quadraphonic FM broadcasts using additional difference signals called &quot;T&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. For a USQ FM broadcast, the additional &quot;T&quot; modulation was placed at 38 kHz in quadrature to the standard stereo difference signal and the &quot;Q&quot; modulation was placed on a carrier at 76 kHz. For standard 2-channel SQ Matrix broadcasts, CBS recommended that an optional pilot-tone be placed at 19 kHz in quadrature to the regular pilot-tone to indicate SQ encoded signals and activate the listeners Logic decoder.

CBS argued that the SQ system should be selected as the standard for quadraphonic FM because, in FCC listening tests of the various four channel broadcast proposals, the 4:2:4 SQ system, decoded with a CBS Paramatrix decoder, outperformed 4:3:4 (without logic) as well as all other 4:2:4 (with logic) systems tested, approaching the performance of a discrete master tape within a very slight margin. At the same time, the SQ &quot;fold&quot; to stereo and mono was preferred to the stereo and mono &quot;fold&quot; of 4:4:4, 4:3:4 and all other 4:2:4 encoding systems.

=== Tate DES decoder ===
The Directional Enhancement System, also known as the Tate DES, was an advanced decoder that enhanced the directionality of the basic SQ matrix.

It first matrixed the four outputs of the SQ decoder to derive additional signals, then compared their envelopes to detect the predominant direction and degree of dominance.
A processor section, implemented outside of the Tate IC chips, applied variable attack/decay timing to the control signals and determined the coefficients of the &quot;B&quot; (Blend) matrices needed to enhance the directionality. These were acted upon by true analog multipliers in the Matrix Multiplier IC&#x27;s, to multiply the incoming matrix by the &quot;B&quot; matrices and produce outputs in which the directionality of all predominant sounds were enhanced.

Since the DES could recognize all three directions of the Energy Sphere simultaneously, and enhance the separation, it had a very open and &#x27;discrete&#x27; sounding soundfield.

In addition, the enhancement was done with sufficient additional complexity that all non-dominant sounds were kept at their proper levels.

Dolby used the Tate DES IC&#x27;s in their theater processors until around 1986, when they developed the Pro Logic system. Unfortunately, delays and problems kept the Tate DES IC&#x27;s from the market until the late-1970s and only two consumer decoders were ever made that employed them, the Audionics Space &amp; Image Composer and the Fosgate Tate II 101A. The Fosgate used a faster, updated version of the IC, called the Tate II, and additional circuitry that provided for separation enhancement around the full 360 soundfield. Unlike the earlier Full Wave-matching Logic decoders for SQ, that varied the output levels to enhance directionality, the Tate DES cancelled SQ signal crosstalk as a function of the predominant directionality, keeping non-dominant sounds and reverberation in its proper spatial locations at their correct level.

== QS matrix, &quot;Regular Matrix&quot;, &quot;Quadraphonic Sound&quot; (4:2:4) ==
&quot;formula_1 phase-shift, formula_2 phase-shift&quot;

==Matrix H (4:2:4)==
&quot;j = 20° phase-shift&quot;
&quot;k = 25° phase-shift&quot;
&quot;l = 55° phase-shift&quot;
&quot;m = 115° phase-shift&quot;

== Ambisonic UHJ kernel (3:2:4 or more)==
&quot;formula_1 phase-shift, formula_2 phase-shift&quot;

== Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround (matrix) 4:2:4 ==

Dolby Stereo and Dolby Surround are also known as Dolby MP, Dolby SVA and Pro Logic.

Dolby SVA matrix is the original name of the Dolby Stereo 4:2:4 encoding matrix.

The term &quot;Dolby Surround&quot; refers to both the encoding and decoding in the home environment, while in the theater it is known &quot;Dolby Stereo&quot;, &quot;Dolby Motion Picture matrix&quot; or &quot;Dolby MP&quot;.
&quot;Pro Logic&quot; refers to the decoder used, there is no special Pro Logic encoding matrix.

The Ultra Stereo system, developed by different company, is compatible and uses similar matrixes to Dolby Stereo.

The Dolby Stereo Matrix is straightforward: the four original channels: Left (L), Center (C), Right (R), and Surround (S), are combined into two, known as Left-total (LT) and Right-total (RT) by this formula:
where &quot;j = 90° phase-shift&quot;

The center channel information is carried by both LT and RT in phase, and surround channel information by both LT and RT but out of phase. The surround channel is a single limited frequency-range (7 kHz low-pass filtered) mono rear channel, dynamically compressed and placed with a lower volume than the rest. This allows for better separation of signals.

This gives good compatibility with both mono playback, which reproduces L, C and R from the mono speaker with C at a level 3 dB higher than L or R, but surround information cancels out. It also gives good compatibility with two-channel stereo playback where C is reproduced from both left and right speakers to form a phantom center and surround is reproduced from both speakers but in a diffuse manner.

A simple 4-channel decoder could simply send the sum signal (L+R) to the center speaker, and the difference signal (L-R) to the surrounds. But such a decoder would provide poor separation between adjacent speaker channels, thus anything intended for the center speaker would also reproduce from left and right speakers only 3 dB below the level in the center speaker. Similarly anything intended for the left speaker would be reproduced from both the center and surround speakers, again only 3 dB below the level in the left speaker. There is, however, complete separation between left and right, and between center and surround channels.

To overcome this problem the cinema decoder uses so-called &quot;logic&quot; circuitry to improve the separation. The logic circuitry decides which speaker channel has the highest signal level and gives it priority, attenuating the signals fed to the adjacent channels. Because there already is complete separation between opposite channels there is no need to attenuate those, in effect the decoder switches between L and R priority and C and S priority. This places some limitations on mixing for Dolby Stereo and to ensure that sound mixers mixed soundtracks appropriately they would monitor the sound mix via a Dolby Stereo encoder and decoder in tandem. In addition to the logic circuitry the surround channel is also fed via a delay, adjustable up to 100 ms to suit auditoria of differing sizes, to ensure that any leakage of program material intended for left or right speakers into the surround channel is always heard first from the intended speaker. This exploits the &quot;Precedence effect&quot; to localize the sound to the intended direction.

== Dolby Pro Logic II matrix (5:2:5) ==
&quot;formula_1 phase-shift, formula_2 phase-shift&quot;

The Pro Logic II matrix provides for stereo full frequency back channels. 
Normally a sub-woofer channel is driven by simply filtering and redirecting the existing bass frequencies of the original stereo track.

<text>Avant-garde metal (also known as avant-metal, experimental metal, art metal and experimetal) is a subgenre of heavy metal music loosely defined by use of experimentation and innovative, avant-garde elements, including non-standard and unconventional sounds, instruments, song structures, playing styles, and vocal techniques. Avant-garde metal is influenced by progressive rock and extreme metal, particularly death metal, and is closely related to progressive metal. Some local scenes include Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, and Seattle in the United States, Oslo in Norway, and Tokyo in Japan.

==Characteristics==
&quot;Avant-garde metal&quot; is interchangeable with &quot;experimental metal&quot; and &quot;avant-metal&quot;, and may also refer to a separate genre of &quot;atmospheric metal&quot; or &quot;post-metal&quot;, which was named in reference to post-rock. Avant-garde metal is related to progressive metal, but avant-garde metal often has more experimentation, while progressive metal usually has a tighter focus on traditional metal instrumentation and higher levels of technical complexity. Avant-garde metal also uses unusual sounds, breaks conventions, and often includes new elements.

The lyrics and visual presentation of the genre are eclectic as well. According to Jeff Wagner in &quot;Mean Deviation&quot;, electronic percussion and drum machines see widespread use by avant-garde metal bands, along with female vocals and operatic elements, all of which he attributes to the influence of the band Celtic Frost. The Canadian group Voivod also influenced future bands in the genre, pioneering technique such as robotic vocal effects, unusual time signatures, and fractured, dissonant, unorthodox guitar sounds.

==History==

According to Ian Christe, avant-garde metal emerged from death metal as a number of musicians &quot;abandoned the tightly wound structure of the music and experimented with abstractions of its founding elements&quot;. Progressive rock has also been cited as an influence. Some early examples are the King Crimson releases &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot; and &quot;Red&quot; in 1973 and 1974 respectively, with the latter album&#x27;s title track defining an &quot;avant-metal style&quot; that Robert Fripp would revisit years later. Another early example is the 1976 Led Zeppelin album &quot;Presence&quot;. Celtic Frost was an early pioneer of the genre; the term &quot;avant-garde metal&quot; was coined to describe their 1987 release &quot;Into the Pandemonium&quot;. Other pioneers of avant-garde metal include Gorguts, Boris, Earth, Helmet, Mayhem, Maudlin of the Well, Neurosis, Sunn O))), Mr. Bungle, Today Is the Day, and Voivod.

In the late 1990s, Misanthropy Records emerged as a promoter of Norwegian avant-garde metal until it folded in 2000, and, according to Jeff Wagner, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, a so-called &quot;new wave of avant-garde metal&quot; was spearheaded by The End Records. Wagner states that &quot;with the support of [Misanthropy and The End Records] and other specialty labels, metal&#x27;s new avant-garde had arrived.&quot; Some other record labels which promote avant-garde metal are Aurora Borealis, The Flenser, Holy Records, Hydra Head Records, Ipecac Recordings, Napalm Records, the Release Entertainment imprint of Relapse Records, Seventh Rule Recordings, and Southern Lord Records. In the United States, local avant-garde metal scenes have emerged in the San Francisco Bay Area with bands such as Giant Squid, Grayceon, and Ludicra, and in Boston, with bands such as Isis, Kayo Dot, and Maudlin of the Well. Some regional scenes that developed in the mid-1990s included the cities of Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Oslo.

<text>2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), also known as STP (standing for &quot;Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace&quot; and/or other phrases), is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. It is generally taken orally.

DOM was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, and later described in his book &quot;PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story&quot; (1991). It is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, and is similarly controlled in other parts of the world. Internationally, it is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

==Effects==
Effects of this drug include substantial perceptual changes such as blurred vision, multiple images, vibration of objects, visual alterations, distorted shapes, enhancement of details, slowed passage of time, increased sexual drive and pleasure, and increased contrasts. It may cause mystical experiences and changes in consciousness. It may also cause pupillary dilation and a rise in systolic blood pressure.

The effects of DOM were assessed in clinical studies in the late 1960s and early 1970s and by other researchers. At low doses, such as 1 to 4mg, DOM produces effects including stimulation, euphoria, enhanced self-awareness, and mild dose-dependent perceptual disturbances. At higher doses, of above 5 to 7mg, DOM produces psychedelic effects.

==Side effects==
Very little is known about the toxicity of DOM.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
====Actions====
DOM acts as a selective serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor full agonist. Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its agonistic properties at the 5-HT2A receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOM is often used in scientific research in studies of the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily. DOM is a chiral molecule, and &quot;R&quot;-(−)-DOM is the more active enantiomer, functioning as a potent agonist of these receptors.

The drug is inactive as a human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) agonist but is an agonist of the rhesus monkey TAAR1. DOM is inactive as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent. It is a very weak monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), specifically of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), whereas it was inactive at monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).

====Effects====
In contrast to amphetamines like (–)-cathinone but similarly to mescaline, DOM has shown no stimulant-like or reinforcing effects in rhesus monkeys. Conversely however, DOC has shown reinforcing effects, including conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration, in rodents similarly to methamphetamine. This is analogous to other findings in which various 2C and NBOMe drugs have been found to produce dopaminergic elevations and reinforcing effects in rodents.

===Pharmacokinetics===
According to Alexander Shulgin, the effects of DOM typically last 14 to 20 hours, though other clinical trials indicate a duration of 7 to 8 hours.

==Chemistry==
DOM, also known as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine or as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-α-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine and is a member of the DOx group of drugs. It is structurally related to the naturally occurring phenethylamine psychedelic mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine). Analogues of DOM include other DOx drugs such as DOET, DOB, DOI, DOC, and TMA, among others. The α-desmethyl or phenethylamine analogue of DOM is 2C-D. Ariadne is the α-ethyl or phenylisobutylamine analogue of DOM.

The 2,6-dimethoxy positional isomer of DOM, known as Ψ-DOM, is also mentioned in &quot;PiHKAL&quot; as being active, as is the α-ethyl homologue Ariadne. Analogues where the methoxy groups at the 2,5- positions of the aromatic ring have been altered have also been synthesised and tested as part of an effort to identify the binding mode of DOM at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Both the 2- and 5- O-desmethyl derivatives 2-DM-DOM and 5-DM-DOM, and the 2- and 5- ethyl analogues 2-Et-DOM and 5-Et-DOM, have been tested, but in all cases were significantly less potent than the corresponding methoxy compound, showing the importance of the oxygen lone pairs in 5-HT2A binding.

==History==
STP was first synthesized and tested in 1963 by Alexander Shulgin, who was investigating the effect of 4-position substitutions on psychedelic amphetamines.

In mid-1967, tablets containing 20mg (later 10mg) of STP were widely distributed in the Haight-Ashbury District of San Francisco under the name of STP, having been manufactured by underground chemists Owsley Stanley and Tim Scully. This short-lived appearance of STP on the black market proved disastrous for several reasons. First, the tablets contained an excessively high dose of the chemical. This, combined with DOM&#x27;s slow onset of action (which encouraged some users, familiar with drugs that have quicker onsets, such as LSD, to re-dose) and its remarkably long duration, caused many users to panic and sent some to the emergency room. Second, treatment of such overdoses was complicated by the fact that no one at the time knew that the tablets called STP were, in fact, DOM, and there was no effective antidote.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
====Australia====
DOM is schedule 9 under the Australia Poisons standard. A schedule 9 substance is a &quot;Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.&quot;

====Canada====
Listed as a Schedule 1, as it is an analogue of amphetamine.

====United Kingdom====
DOM is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

====United States====
DOM is Schedule I in the United States. This means it is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, or distribute (make, trade, own or give) without a DEA license.

<text>The precedence effect or law of the first wavefront is a binaural psychoacoustical effect concerning sound reflection and the perception of echoes. When two versions of the same sound presented are separated by a sufficiently short time delay (below the listener&#x27;s echo threshold), listeners perceive a single auditory event; its perceived spatial location is dominated by the location of the first-arriving sound (the first wave front). The lagging sound does also affect the perceived location; however, its effect is mostly suppressed by the first-arriving sound.

The Haas effect was described in 1949 by Helmut Haas in his Ph.D. thesis. The term &quot;Haas effect&quot; is often loosely taken to include the precedence effect which underlies it.

== History ==
Joseph Henry published &quot;On The Limit of Perceptibility of a Direct and Reflected Sound&quot; in 1851.

The &quot;law of the first wavefront&quot; was described and named in 1948 by Lothar Cremer.

The &quot;precedence effect&quot; was described and named in 1949 by Wallach et al. They showed that when two identical sounds are presented in close succession they will be heard as a single fused sound. In their experiments, fusion occurred when the lag between the two sounds was in the range 1 to 5 ms for clicks, and up to 40 ms for more complex sounds such as speech or piano music. When the lag was longer, the second sound was heard as an echo.

Additionally, Wallach et al. demonstrated that when successive sounds coming from sources at different locations were heard as fused, the apparent location of the perceived sound was dominated by the location of the sound that reached the ears first (i.e. the first-arriving wavefront). The second-arriving sound had only a very small (albeit measurable) effect on the perceived location of the fused sound. They designated this phenomenon as the &quot;precedence effect&quot;, and noted that it explains why sound localization is possible in the typical situation where sounds reverberate from walls, furniture and the like, thus providing multiple, successive stimuli. They also noted that the precedence effect is an important factor in the perception of stereophonic sound.

Wallach et al. did not systematically vary the intensities of the two sounds, although they cited research by Langmuir et al. which suggested that if the second-arriving sound is at least 15 dB louder than the first, the precedence effect breaks down.

The &quot;Haas effect&quot; derives from a 1951 paper by Helmut Haas.
In 1951 Haas examined how the perception of speech is affected in the presence of a single, coherent sound reflection. To create anechoic conditions, the experiment was carried out on the rooftop of a freestanding building. Another test was carried out in a room with a reverberation time of 1.6 s. The test signal (recorded speech) was emitted from two similar loudspeakers at locations 45° to the left and to the right in 3 m distance to the listener.

Haas found that humans localize sound sources in the direction of the first arriving sound despite the presence of a single reflection from a different direction, and that in such cases only a single auditory event is perceived. A reflection arriving later than 1 ms after the direct sound increases the perceived level and spaciousness (more precisely the perceived width of the sound source). A single reflection arriving at a delay of between 5 and 30 ms can be up to 10 dB louder than the direct sound without being perceived as a secondary auditory event (i.e. it does not sound like an echo). This time span varies with the reflection level. If the direct sound is coming from the same direction the listener is facing, the reflection&#x27;s direction has no significant effect on the results. If the reflection&#x27;s higher frequencies are attenuated, echo suppression continues to occur even if the delay between the sounds is somewhat longer. Increased room reverberation time also expands the time span available for echo suppression.

== Conditions for occurrence ==
The precedence effect occurs if the subsequent wave fronts arrive between 2 ms and about 50 ms later than the first wave front. This range is signal dependent. For speech, the precedence effect disappears for delays above 50 ms, but for music, the precedence effect can still occur with delays approaching 100 ms.

In two-click lead–lag experiments, localization effects include aspects of &quot;summing localization&quot;, &quot;localization dominance&quot;, and &quot;lag discrimination suppression&quot;. The last two are generally considered to be aspects of the precedence effect:
* Summing localization: for time delays below 2 ms, listeners only perceive one sound; its direction is between the locations of the lead and lag sounds. An application for summing localization is the intensity stereophony, where two loudspeakers emit the same signal with different levels, resulting in the localized sound direction between both loudspeakers. The localized direction depends on the level difference between the loudspeakers.
* Localization dominance: for delays between 2 and 5 ms, listeners also perceive one sound; its location is determined by the location of the leading sound.
* Lag discrimination suppression: for short time delays, listeners are less capable of discriminating the location of the lagging sound.

For time delays above 50 ms (for speech) or some 100 ms (for music) the delayed sound is perceived as an echo of the first-arriving sound, and each sound direction is localized separately and correctly. The time delay for perceiving echoes depends on the signal characteristics. For signals with impulse characteristics, echoes are perceived for delays above 50 ms. For signals with a nearly constant amplitude, the threshold before perceiving an echo can be enhanced up to time differences of 1 to 2 seconds.

A special appearance of the precedence effect is the Haas effect. Haas showed that the precedence effect appears even if the level of the delayed sound is up to 10 dB higher than the level of the first wave front. In this case, the precedence effect only works for delays between 10 and 30 ms.

== Applications ==
The precedence effect is important for hearing in enclosed spaces. With the help of this effect, it remains possible to determine the direction of a sound source (e.g. the direction of a speaker) even in the presence of wall reflections.

===Sound reinforcement systems===
Haas&#x27;s findings can be applied to sound reinforcement systems and public address systems. The signal for loudspeakers placed at distant locations from a stage may be delayed electronically by an amount equal to the time sound takes to travel through the air from the stage to the distant location, plus about 10 to 20 milliseconds, and played at a level up to 10 dB louder than the sound reaching this location directly from the stage. The first arrival of sound from the source on stage determines perceived localization whereas the slightly later sound from delayed loudspeakers simply increases the perceived sound level without negatively affecting localization. In this configuration, the listener will localize all sound from the direction of the direct sound, but they will benefit from the higher sound level, which has been enhanced by the loudspeakers.

===Ambience extraction===
The precedence effect can be employed to increase the perception of ambience during the playback of stereo recordings. If two more speakers are placed to the left and right of the listener (in addition to the two main speakers), and are fed with the same program material but delayed by 10 to 20 milliseconds, the random-phase ambience components of the sound will become sufficiently decorrelated that they cannot be localized. This effectively extracts the recording&#x27;s existing ambience, while leaving its foreground &quot;direct&quot; sounds still appearing to come from the front.

=== Multichannel audio decoding ===
The effect was taken into account and exploited in the psychoacoustics of the Fosgate Tate 101A SQ decoder, developed by Jim Fosgate in consultation with Peter Scheiber and Martin Willcocks, to produce much better spatiality and directionality in matrix decoding of 4-2-4 (SQ quadraphonic) audio.

=== Haas kicker ===
Many older LEDE (&quot;live end, dead end&quot;) control room designs featured so-called &quot;Haas kickers&quot; – reflective panels placed at the rear to create specular reflections which were thought to provide a wider stereo listening area or raise intelligibility. However, what is beneficial for one type of sound is detrimental to others, so Haas kickers, like compression ceilings, are no longer commonly found in control rooms.

<text>The County of Hainaut ( ; ; ; ), sometimes spelled Hainault, was a territorial lordship within the medieval Holy Roman Empire that straddled the present-day border of Belgium and France. Its most important towns included Mons (), now in Belgium, and Valenciennes, now in France.

The core of the county, named after the river Haine, stretched southeast to include the &quot;Avesnois&quot; region and southwest to the Selle (Scheldt tributary). In the Middle Ages, its Counts also gained control of part of the original &quot;pagus&quot; of Brabant to its north and the &quot;pagus&quot; of Oosterbant to the east, but they did not form part of the old &quot;pagus&quot; of Hainaut. In modern terms, the original core of Hainaut consisted of the central part of the Belgian province of Hainaut, and the eastern part of the French &quot;département&quot; of Nord (the arrondissements of Avesnes-sur-Helpe and Valenciennes).

Hainaut appears in 8th-century records as a Frankish &quot;gau&quot; or &quot;pagus&quot; which included the Roman towns of Famars and Bavay. In the 9th century, if not earlier, it was also described as a county, which implies that it had a single count governing it. As with many counties of the region, there was apparently a 10th-century fragmentation of territories among different counts, which is difficult to reconstruct. In 1071 a single large territorial county was given its more-or-less final form that lasted for the rest of the Middle Ages.

For much of its existence the County of Hainaut was a frontier territory, bordering upon the Kingdom of France. From 843 the County formed part of the &quot;middle kingdom&quot; of Lotharingia. After about 925 Lotharingia was definitively attached by King Henry the Fowler to his eastern Frankish realm that would become the Kingdom of Germany. Hainaut and its neighbourhood remained an important frontier area, or &quot;march&quot;, during the High Middle Ages. Though a part of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled from present-day Germany, it was culturally and linguistically French and ecclesiastically part of the Catholic Archdiocese of Reims. Like its neighbours such as the counties of Brabant and Flanders, it frequently became entangled in the politics of France.

The counts of Hainaut were often rulers of other counties, including Flanders and Holland. Examples of such personal unions include the following:
* Hainaut and Flanders: 1067–71 and again 1191–1246
* Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland: 1299–1356
* Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland as part of Bavaria-Straubing: 1356–1432

In 1432, Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland joined Flanders, Artois, Namur, Brabant, Limbourg, and later Luxembourg, within the large agglomeration of territories in the Low Countries belonging to the French House of Valois-Burgundy. This new state, the Burgundian Netherlands, was inherited by the Habsburg dynasty in the 1470s.

In 1659 and 1678 southern Hainaut was acquired by France. The northern part continued as part of the Habsburg Netherlands. Like much of that state, the northern part of Hainaut was absorbed into the First French Republic in 1797 after the end of the Ancien Régime; it later became part of newly-formed Belgium in 1830.

==Geographical definition==
The river Haine, for which the original &quot;pagus&quot; (country or territory) is named, flows from east to west. It originates in the once forested area between Binche and modern Charleroi, near the Sambre. It empties into the Scheldt. From the earliest records, Hainaut also extended south of the Haine to the upper Sambre, the Helpe Majeure, Helpe Mineure and the &quot;Avesnois&quot; region in the Arrondissement of Avesnes-sur-Helpe.

Hainaut&#x27;s &quot;pagus&quot; also extended southwest along the Scheldt as far as the Selle river, where the most significant Roman city of the area was Famars (Roman &quot;Fanum Martis&quot;, literally &#x27;shrine of Mars&#x27;), which had been a religious and administrative centre. In the early Middle Ages, records sometimes refer to places within the &quot;pagus&quot; of Hainaut as being within the &quot;pagus Fanomartenis&quot;, indicating that either Hainaut had an alternative name, or that Fanum Martis was base to a sub-&quot;pagus&quot;. According to the 10th-century monk Folcuin, Hainaut was simply a new name for the old Roman name, which had been connected to pre-Christian superstition.

The geographical definition of Hainaut as found in the oldest medieval records, was relatively stable, as shown by Faider-Feytman, Deru, and other historians of the region. According to archaeological evidence, geographical Hainaut, including Avesnes, formed the oldest region of development in the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Belgic Nervii. They had their early capital in Bavay in Hainaut (Roman &quot;Bagacum&quot;), which became a major Roman crossroads. 
*To the south of the &quot;Avesnois&quot;, beyond the forest and hills of Thiérache was the &quot;pagus&quot; and bishopric of Laon, the modern department of Aisne, which was one part of the old &quot;civitas&quot; of the Roman era Remi.
*To the southwest, the &quot;pagus&quot; of Cambrai lay beyond the Senne river, and became the capital of the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Nervii, and later the seat of the medieval bishop who had jurisdiction over Hainaut and Brabant. According to Xavier Deru, this region only developed during the Roman era, with Cambrai itself positioned on the point where a major Roman road crossed the Scheldt. This region corresponds closely to the modern French Arrondissement of Cambrai, and both it and the bishopric are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Cambrésis&quot;.
*Directly to the west across the Scheldt from Valenciennes, lay the &quot;pagus&quot; called the Osterbant (fr, de, nl), which was originally part of the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Atrebates in Roman times, which has its traditional capital in Arras. The medieval bishopric of Arras contained only two archdeaconries: Arras itself, and Osterbant. While Osterbant was a region that was competed over by the powerful counties of Flanders and Hainaut in the Middle Ages, the rest of the Atrebates&#x27; old country became the basis of the medieval county of Artois, which was normally under Flemish control. In modern France, Osterbant is similar in definition to the Arrondissement of Douai.
*To the north, also within the original &quot;civitas&quot; of the Nervii, lay what would become the oldest form of the &quot;pagus&quot; of Brabant, stretching between the Scheldt and Dyle and including modern Aalst and Brussels. Medieval and modern Hainaut stretch into the south of the old &quot;pagus&quot; of Brabant. As shown by Deru, archaeological evidence such as coin finds confirm the cultural connections between Brabant and Hainaut in Roman times.
*To the east of the River Haine lay the &quot;Silva Carbonaria&quot; (&quot;charcoal forest&quot;) which once defined a major boundary. Beyond it, the regions which today contain Charleroi, Namur and Leuven were all within the Roman Civitas Tungrorum and medieval Bishopric of Liège.

==Etymology==
The etymology of Hainaut is thought to be Germanic. The first part is the river name (the modern Haine, probably based on Germanic) and the second component was originally based upon Germanic *awja, which appears in several old Frankish gau names, such as &quot;Masau&quot;, the oldest name of the &quot;pagus&quot; on the Meuse river north of Maastricht. The related word &quot;gau&quot;, used in the modern Dutch and German names of Hainaut, &quot;Henegouwen&quot; and &quot;Hennegau&quot;, was also used but never became popular in medieval documents concerning this particular area.

==Earliest records==
The first surviving records indicating that Hainaut was a county are the records of the Carolingian dynasty being divided into parts in 831, 843 and 870. Most of the early medieval records mentioning Hainaut, starting in the 9th century, describe it as a &quot;pagus&quot;, a land or country, rather than a county. 8th- and 9th-century attestations, as listed by Ulrich Nonn, however, never name any specific counts who ruled it:
*750. A document of Pepin the Short refers to a place &quot;in pago Hainoavio&quot;.
*779. A document of Charlemagne refers to a place &quot;in pago Haginao&quot;.
*831. Louis the Pious announced that the division of the empire would be such that his son Louis the German&#x27;s domain of Bavaria would include places west of the Meuse including &quot;Ainau&quot;. The record is not explicit about it being a county or &quot;pagus&quot;.
*843. The Treaty of Verdun, as recorded in the Annales Bertiniani mentions &quot;hainaum&quot; among the regions between the Scheldt and Rhine to become part of the middle kingdom of Lothair I, and implies it is a county.
*844. A document of Lothair I refers to places &quot;in pago Hainoense&quot; [...] &quot;pago Hainnioense&quot; 
*847. A document of Charles the Bald names places in &quot;pago Hagnuensi&quot;.
*852. A document of Lothair I names places in &quot;pago Haynau&quot;.
*855. A document of Lothair II names places in &quot;pago Hainau&quot;.
*870. A document of Charles the Bald names places in &quot;pago Hainao&quot;.
*870. The Treaty of Meerssen mentions the &quot;comitatus Hainoum&quot;, a county, and granted it to the western kingdom.
*872. A document of Charles the Bald names places in &quot;pago Hainau&quot;.

Many such early medieval &quot;pagi&quot; in Europe have histories going back to the Roman Empire. As the Roman empire lost centralized control of this region, which lay in the Roman province of Belgica II, it came under the administration of Childeric I, who had been the military ruler of the Frankish army who previously fought under Romans in Gaul, north of the Loire. The Merovingian dynasty, and later the Carolingians, kept many of the Roman districts, and established counts to administer &quot;pagi&quot;. 
==10th century==
As explained by Nonn, there are very few, if any, clear records of counts of all Hainaut in the 10th century. The region is associated by many historians such as Leon Vanderkindere with the so-called Reginarid dynasty who were a powerful and rebellious Lotharingian family, known for their frequent use of the name Reginar. This is because later in the 10th century a branch of this family succeeded to take the county by force, after returning from exile. However, while the later family clearly claimed to have once had important rights throughout Lotharingia, the exact nature of most of these is unclear, and their possession of a county in Hainaut before Reginar III can not be proven.

The only medieval record which claims that Reginar I had direct lordship over Hainaut was the much later Dudo of Saint-Quentin, who is considered to be unreliable for this period. He names Reginar as &quot;Duke&quot; (Latin &quot;dux&quot;) of both Hesbaye and Hainaut, and discusses his march against Rollo in Walcheren, together with a Frisian ruler named Radbod, at some point in late 9th or early 10th century. The late 14th century &quot;Annales Hannoniae&quot;, which give legendary origins of the Counts of Hainaut, describes this Reginar I as a count of Mons – a title held by his descendants.

The first recorded count who was associated as a count with any part of Hainaut in a contemporary record was Count Sigehard. Leon Vanderkindere proposed that this Sigehard was given the county while Reginar I was out of favour. In fact no such connections can be proven. He was more clearly described as a count in the &quot;pagus&quot; Liugas, east of Liège. 
*902. The county of Sigarhard included Wandre and Esneux in the &quot;pagus&quot; of Liège (&quot;in pago Leuchia in comitatu Sigarhardi&quot;).
*908. He was recorded once as a count who was present agreements made about both Lobbes Abbey (&quot;Laubacensum abbatiam&quot;), which was described as part of the county and &quot;pagus&quot; of Hainaut (&quot;in pago ac in comitatu Hainuensi sitem&quot;), and Theux, which was described as being in the &quot;pagus&quot; and county of Liugas (&quot;in pago ac in comitatu Liwensi positum&quot;).
*915. Theux is described as being both in the &quot;pagus&quot; of Liugas and the county of Sigehard (&quot;in pago Leuviensi atque in comitatus Sichardi sitam&quot;).
*916 and 919, Sigehard appears in two documents of West Francia king Charles the Simple dated at Herstal near Liège.
*920. Sigehard was also recorded as a &quot;venerable&quot; count in a document concerning Crespin Abbey, concerning a grant.. According to Nonn, the record shows that he had held the land involved.

From 925, Lotharingia, including Hainaut, was continuously part of the eastern kingdom, &quot;Germany&quot;. In 939, the Reginars led a rebellion against Germany which was defeated. Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine, the son of Reginar I who had been leader of this rebellion, was killed.

Reginar II (died before 943), the younger son of Reginar I, was named as a Count of Hainaut in the late 11th-century life story (&quot;Vita&quot;) of Gerard of Brogne (died 959), but this work is considered unreliable, and we can not be certain of this position. His son Count Reginar III Longneck, may also have been a count in Hainaut. What is more certain is that he unsuccessfully rebelled against Duke Bruno the Great, so he was deposed from all offices, exiled and banned in 958. The &quot;Vita&quot; of Gerard of Brogne also names him as a count of Hainaut. Ulrich Nonn considers it likely that he held Mons because it aligns with other evidence.

A Count named Amelric who was &quot;from&quot; the pagus of Hainaut (Latin: ) is named in or after 953 in the &quot;Deeds of the bishops of Cambrai&quot;. This is generally taken to mean that Hainaut already included the jurisdictions of more than one count. Apart from the one associated with Mons, Amulric perhaps held a county based in Valenciennes.

The second or third count of Hainaut to be named in a contemporary record was however called Godefrid, starting in 958, the year of Reginar III&#x27;s exile. He is generally considered to be Godfrey I, Duke of Lower Lorraine who died in 964 in Italy.

After the death of Godfrey in Italy, he was replaced in Hainaut by a Count Richer, who was perhaps the same Count Richer who held a county in the &quot;pagus&quot; of Liège. In 972 he died. In 973 two noble brothers, Werner and Reynold, were killed near Mons fighting the two sons of Reginar III, Reginar IV and Lambert, who had returned to claim their father&#x27;s property. Also in 973, Counts named Amelric and Richizo appeared in a royal grant in favour of Crispin Abbey in Hainaut. Amelric is probably the count of 953 mentioned above, with his seat in or near Valenciennes. According to Hlawitchka, Richizo is probably Richwin, a brother of Count Richer who died in 972.

The Regnarid brothers apparently did not succeed in gaining Hainaut, or even Mons for some decades. The &quot;Gesta&quot; of the bishops of Cambrai records that two counts named Godefrid and Arnulf succeeded Richizo and Amelric, and these two counts were involved in a defense of Cambrai in 979, and appear in other records. They are believed to be the same as Count Godfrey &quot;the captive&quot;, and Arnulf of Valenciennes.

In 998 the Reginar IV regained control over the County of Mons, in Hainaut, from Godfrey according to Alberic of Trois-Fontaines. Historian Michel de Waha believes this late report can not be trusted, and that we can only say they took control in the period 985–1015, and probably after 1007. Reginar IV died 1013, and was succeeded by his son Reginar V. Reginar IV&#x27;s brother Lambert, who made himself Count of Louvain, died in battle in Hainaut in 1015.

The County of Valenciennes disappears from records after the death of Arnulf of Valenciennes in about 1011, with this part of Hainaut possibly being taken over by the County of Flanders.

==High Middle Ages (1000–1250)==

Reginar V, the son of Reginar IV, married the granddaughter of his father&#x27;s old rival, Godefrid the &quot;captive&quot;. The bishop, Gerard of Florennes, accepted this diplomatic marriage despite the couple being within the degrees of relationship where this would normally not be allowed.

When the last Reginarid Count of Hainaut, Herman, the son of Reginar V, died without issue in 1051, his widow Richilde married Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders, who was a vassal of the French crown. On the death of his father in 1067, Baldwin VI became the ruler of both Hainaut and Flanders. He was succeeded by his son Arnulf III, who was killed at the Battle of Cassel in 1071 in an inheritance dispute with his uncle, Robert I the Frisian. The victorious Robert acquired Flanders, but his sister-in-law Richilde retained the adjacent Lower Lorraine territories in the Holy Roman Empire as her dowry. The revived County of Hainaut, therefore, emerged from the refeudalisation of three immediate counties:
* the County of Mons
* the southern part of the old &quot;Pagus&quot; of Brabant
* the Ottonian Margraviate of Valenciennes

The unification of the County of Hainaut as an Imperial fief was accomplished after Arnulf&#x27;s defeat in 1071, when Richilde and her son Baldwin II tried to sell their fiefs to Emperor Henry IV. Henry IV ordered the Prince-Bishop of Liège to purchase the fiefs and then return them as a unified county to the countess Richilde and, through the chain of feudal authority, to the Dukes of Lower Lorraine.

Although Baldwin II did not inherit the County of Flanders, he and his descendants, Baldwin III, Baldwin IV, and Baldwin V, were in the male line of the Counts of Flanders, and the two lines joined again. Baldwin V married the heiress of Flanders, Margaret in 1169, becoming &quot;Baldwin VIII&quot; of Flanders, and during his lifetime Flanders, Hainaut and Namur were united under one lord.

In the next generation, Namur was given to a different son than Flanders and Hainaut, which remained together under Baldwin VI/IX, who became the first emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople. Baldwin&#x27;s brother, Philip I of Namur was regent in Hainaut but also had to fight Luxembourg for control of Namur. Baldwin himself was killed in Bulgaria, leaving two heiresses, Joan who ruled but died childless in 1244, and Margaret who ruled from 1244 and married twice. The lines of her two husbands divided Flanders and Hainaut between them:
*Jean of Avesnes, eldest son of Margaret&#x27;s first husband, founded a new line of Avesnes counts of Hainaut and died in 1257.
*Guy of Dampierre, eldest surviving son of Margaret&#x27;s second husband, founded the new line of Flanders counts and died in 1305. He also became count of Namur, though this inheritance was given to a different child.

==Late Middle Ages (1250–1500)==
From 1299, Hainaut&#x27;s count Jean II, d&#x27;Avesnes, the son of Jean I, was also Count of Holland and Zeeland, through his mother. He was also an unsuccessful claimant to become Count of Flanders. After his grandson William died in 1347, these same lordships went to his sister, and were held by members of the Wittelsbach dynasty who also possessed the Dukedom of Bavaria-Straubing. This branch of the Wittelsbach family held Hainaut until 1436.

The Wittelsbachs struggled against each other in the so-called Hook and Cod wars which were partly driven by factions in Holland. After the death of Duke William II of Bavaria-Straubing in 1417, Hainaut was inherited by his daughter Jacqueline, who had a powerful opponent in her cousin, Philip the Good.

Already in 1428, effective control of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland was acquired by Philip the Good. In 1432 Jacqueline had to cede the inheritance rights of Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland to Duke Philip. The last independent countess died early on 8 October 1436 (presumably of tuberculosis) in Teylingen Castle, near The Hague, where she is buried. Her estates were incorporated into the Burgundian Netherlands.

Philip was already Duke of Burgundy, Count of Flanders, Artois, Namur and Franche-Comte, and would later become Duke of Brabant, Limbourg, and Luxembourg. His family, the House of Valois-Burgundy, a branch of the French royal family, created a powerful state between France and Germany and Hainaut was part of it. Charles the Bold of Burgundy, the son of Philip, was however killed at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, and the male line of the Burgundian dukes became extinct. In the same year, Charles&#x27; daughter Mary of Burgundy married Archduke Maximilian I of Habsburg, the son of Emperor Frederick III, and Hainaut passed to the Habsburg dynasty, who were emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and kings of Spain.

King Louis XI of France had hoped to take advantage of the death of his cousin, Charles and sent an army to invade the Netherlands. However, the French were defeated at the Battle of Guinegate in 1479, and Hainaut was consolidated in the Habsburg Netherlands by the Treaty of Arras in 1482.

==Early modern period (1500–1800)==
Hainaut became part of the Burgundian Circle in the Holy Roman empire in 1512. It was ruled by the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs from 1555 to 1714.

In 1579 Hainaut was a member of the Union of Arras which submitted to the rule of Habsburg Spain, while the northern Union of Utrecht rebelled and formed the Dutch Republic in 1581.

The 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees and the 1679 Treaties of Nijmegen cut Hainaut in two. The southern area, around the towns of Valenciennes, Le Quesnoy and Avesnes, was ceded to France under King Louis XIV. During the French revolution it formed the basis of the newly named French &quot;département&quot; of Nord. Today the area is still referred to as French Hainaut.

The northern part of Hainaut, around Mons, remained part of the Spanish Netherlands, which became the Austrian Netherlands after the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht – moving possession from one branch of the Habsburgs to another.

In 1797, during the French Revolution, the northern part of the county was ceded to France by Emperor Francis II, who was also count of Hainaut. It became the French &quot;département&quot; of Jemappe. After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the northern part, once again called Hainaut, went to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands, and then in 1830 to the Kingdom of Belgium which was created from the southern part of that kingdom. It forms the basis of the modern Province of Hainaut in Belgium.

In modern Hainaut the traditional county&#x27;s heritage can still for example be seen in the dialect differences. The western part of Hainaut is a transitional area between Picard and Walloon dialects.

<text>Richard Diebenkorn (April 22, 1922 – March 30, 1993) was an American painter and printmaker. His early work is associated with abstract expressionism and the Bay Area Figurative Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. In the late 1960s he began his extensive series of geometric, lyrical abstract paintings. Known as the &quot;Ocean Park&quot; paintings, these paintings were instrumental to his achievement of worldwide acclaim. Art critic Michael Kimmelman described Diebenkorn as &quot;one of the premier American painters of the postwar era, whose deeply lyrical abstractions evoked the shimmering light and wide-open spaces of California, where he spent virtually his entire life.&quot;

==Biography==
Richard Clifford Diebenkorn Jr. was born on April 22, 1922, in Portland, Oregon. His family moved to San Francisco, California, when he was two years old. From the age of four or five he was continually drawing. In 1940, Diebenkorn entered Stanford University, where he met his first two artistic mentors, professor and muralist Victor Arnautoff, who guided Diebenkorn in classical formal discipline with oil paint, and Daniel Mendelowitz, with whom he shared a passion for the work of Edward Hopper.
Hopper&#x27;s influence can be seen in Diebenkorn&#x27;s representational work of this time. While attending Stanford, Diebenkorn visited the home of Sarah Stein, the sister-in-law of Gertrude Stein, and first saw the works of European modernist masters Cézanne, Picasso, and Matisse.

Also at Stanford, Diebenkorn met his fellow student and future wife, Phyllis Antoinette Gilman. They married in 1943 and went on to have two children together, a daughter, Gretchen (1945), and a son, Christopher (1947). The beginning of the United States&#x27;s involvement in World War II interrupted Deibenkorn&#x27;s education at Stanford, and he was not able complete his degree at that time. Diebenkorn entered the United States Marine Corps in 1943, where he served until 1945.

While enlisted, Diebenkorn continued to study art and expanded his knowledge of European modernism, first while enrolled briefly at the University of California, Berkeley, and later on the East Coast, while stationed at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. While enrolled at Berkeley he had three influential teachers: Worth Ryder, Erle Loran, and Eugene Neuhaus. Both Ryder and Erle Loran had studied art in Europe in the 1920s and brought their first-hand knowledge of European modernism to their teaching. Neuhaus emigrated from Germany in 1904 and was a seminal figure in establishing the Bay Area as a center of art appreciation and education on the West Coast. On the East Coast, when he transferred to the base in Quantico, Diebenkorn took advantage of his location to visit art museums in Washington, DC, Philadelphia, and New York City. This allowed him to study in person the paintings of modern masters such as Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Joan Miró, and Pablo Picasso. Also at this time, he had his first exposure to the new New York–based artists who were beginning their abstract Surrealism-based paintings. The work of Robert Motherwell, in particular, left an impression. Diebenkorn began his own experiments in abstract painting.

In 1945, Diebenkorn was scheduled to deploy to Japan; however, with the war&#x27;s end in August 1945, he was discharged and returned to life in the Bay Area.

During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Diebenkorn lived and worked in various places: San Francisco and Sausalito (1946–47 and 1947–1950), Woodstock, New York (1947), Albuquerque, New Mexico (1950–1952), Urbana, Illinois (1952–53), and Berkeley, California (1953–1966). He developed his own style of abstract expressionist painting. After World War II, the art world&#x27;s focus shifted from the School of Paris to the United States and, in particular, to the New York School. In 1946, Diebenkorn enrolled as a student in the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA) in San Francisco (now known as the San Francisco Art Institute), which was developing its own vigorous style of abstract expressionism. In 1947, after ten months in Woodstock on an Alfred Bender travel grant, Diebenkorn returned to the CSFA, where he adopted abstract expressionism as his vehicle for self-expression. He was offered a place on the CSFA faculty in 1947 and taught there until 1950. He was influenced at first by Clyfford Still, who also taught at the CSFA from 1946 to 1950, Arshile Gorky, Hassel Smith, and Willem de Kooning. Diebenkorn became a leading abstract expressionist on the West Coast. From 1950 to 1952, Diebenkorn was enrolled under the G.I. Bill in the University of New Mexico’s graduate fine arts department, where he continued to adapt his abstract expressionist style.

For the academic year 1952–53, Richard Diebenkorn took a faculty position at the University of Illinois in Urbana, where he taught painting and drawing. In November and December 1952, he had his first solo exhibit at a commercial art gallery, the Paul Kantor Gallery in Los Angeles.

In September 1953, Diebenkorn moved to back to the San Francisco Bay Area from New York City, where he had spent the summer. He took a position at California College of Arts and Crafts in 1955, teaching until 1958. He established his home in Berkeley and lived there until 1966. During the first few years of this period, Diebenkorn abandoned his strict adherence to abstract expressionism and began to work in a more representational style. By the mid-1950s, Diebenkorn had become an important figurative painter, in a style that bridged Henri Matisse and abstract expressionism. Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff, Henry Villierme, David Park, James Weeks, and others participated in a renaissance of figurative painting, dubbed the Bay Area Figurative Movement. His subject matter during this period included interiors, landscapes, still lifes, and the human figure.

Diebenkorn began to have a measure of success with his artwork during this period. He was included in several group shows and had several solo exhibits. In 1960, a mid-career retrospective was presented by the Pasadena Art Museum (now the Norton Simon Museum). That autumn, a variation of the show moved to the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco.
In the summer of 1961, while a visiting instructor at UCLA, Diebenkorn first became acquainted with printmaking when his graduate assistant introduced him to the printmaking technique of drypoint. Also while in Southern California, Diebenkorn was a guest at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop (now the Tamarind Institute), where he worked on a suite of prints completed in 1962.

Upon his return to Berkeley in the fall of 1961, Diebenkorn began seriously exploring drypoint and printmaking with Kathan Brown at her newly established fine arts printing press, Crown Point Press. In 1965, Crown Point Press printed and published an edition of thirteen bound volumes and twelve unbound folios of Diebenkorn&#x27;s first suite of prints, &quot;41 Etchings Drypoints&quot;. This project was the first publication of Crown Point&#x27;s catalog). Diebenkorn would not do any more etching again until 1977 when Brown renewed their artistic relationship. From then until 1992, Diebenkorn returned almost yearly to Crown Point Press to produce work.

Also in the fall of 1961, Diebenkorn became a faculty member at the San Francisco Art Institute, where he taught periodically until 1966. He also taught intermittently during these years at a number of other colleges, including the California College of Arts and Crafts and Mills College in Oakland, the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

In September 1963, Diebenkorn was named the first artist-in-residence at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, an appointment that lasted until June 1964. His only responsibility in this position was to produce art in a studio provided by the university. Students were allowed to visit him in the studio during scheduled times. Though he created a few paintings during his time at Stanford, he produced many drawings. Stanford presented an extensive show of these drawings at the end of his residency.

From fall 1964 to spring 1965, Diebenkorn traveled through Europe, and he was granted a cultural visa to visit important Soviet museums and view their holdings of Matisse&#x27;s paintings. When he returned to painting in the Bay Area in mid-1965, his works summed up all he had learned from more than a decade as a leading figurative painter.

The Henri Matisse paintings &quot;French Window at Collioure&quot;, and &quot;View of Notre-Dame&quot;, both from 1914, exerted tremendous influence on Richard Diebenkorn&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Park&quot; paintings.
According to art historian Jane Livingston, Diebenkorn saw both Matisse paintings in an exhibition in Los Angeles in 1966, which enormously affected him and his work. Livingston said about the January 1966 Matisse exhibition that Diebenkorn saw in Los Angeles,
It is difficult not to ascribe enormous weight to this experience for the direction his work took from that time on. Two pictures he saw there reverberate in almost every &quot;Ocean Park&quot; canvas. &quot;View of Notre Dame&quot; and the &quot;French Window at Collioure&quot;, painted in 1914, were on view for the first time in the US.
Livingston said, &quot;Diebenkorn must have experienced &quot;French Window at Collioure&quot; as an epiphany.&quot;

In September 1966, Diebenkorn moved to Santa Monica, California, and took up a professorship at UCLA. He moved into a small studio space in the same building as his old friend from the Bay Area, Sam Francis. During this time, he lived in a house on Amalfi Drive in Santa Monica Canyon, where he would host an artist collective. In the winter of 1966–67, he returned to abstraction, this time in a distinctly personal, geometric style that departed from his early abstract expressionist period. The &quot;Ocean Park&quot; series, begun in 1967 and developed for the next 18 years, became his most famous work and resulted in approximately 135 paintings. Based on the aerial landscape and perhaps the view from his studio window, these large-scale abstract compositions were named after a community in Santa Monica, where he had his studio. Diebenkorn retired from UCLA in 1973. The &quot;Ocean Park&quot; series bridged his earlier abstract expressionist works with color field painting and lyrical abstraction.

In 1986, Diebenkorn decided to leave Santa Monica and Southern California. After traveling and looking around several different areas in the western United States, in 1988, Diebenkorn and his wife settled in Healdsburg, California, where he built a new studio. In 1989 he began suffering serious health issues related to heart disease. Though still producing prints, drawings, and smaller paintings, his poor health prevented him from completing larger paintings. In 1990, Diebenkorn produced a series of six etchings for the Arion Press edition of &quot;Poems of W. B. Yeats&quot;, with poems selected and introduced by Helen Vendler.

Diebenkorn died due to complications from emphysema in Berkeley on March 30, 1993.

==Exhibitions==
Diebenkorn had his first show at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco 1948. The first important retrospective of his work took place at the Albright–Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, in 1976–77; the show, then traveled to Washington, DC, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, and Oakland. In 1989, John Elderfield, then a curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, organized a show of Diebenkorn&#x27;s works on paper, which constituted an important part of his production.

In 2012, an exhibition, &quot;Richard Diebenkorn: The Ocean Park Series&quot;, curated by Sarah C. Bancroft, traveled to the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, the Orange County Museum of Art, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.

Major recent shows in the San Francisco Bay Area have included &quot;Diebenkorn: The Berkeley Years&quot;, July–September 2013, at the De Young Museum, San Francisco; an exhibition of small works, June 6–August 23, 2015, at the Sonoma Valley Museum of Art, Sonoma; and &quot;Matisse/Diebenkorn&quot;, a major show highlighting Matisses&#x27;s influence on Richard Diebenkorn, March 11–May 29, 2017, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

==Collections==
Diebenkorn&#x27;s work can be found in a number of public collections including the New Mexico Museum of Art, Santa Fe, New Mexico; Honolulu Museum of Art, Honolulu, Hawaii; Albertina, Vienna, Austria; Albright–Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York; Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago; Baltimore Museum of Art; Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; the de Young Museum, San Francisco; Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Michigan, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Minneapolis Institute of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas; Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. The Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University is home to 29 of Diebenkorn&#x27;s sketchbooks as well as a collection of paintings and other works on paper.

==Recognition==
In 1978, Diebenkorn was awarded The Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture.

In 1991, Diebenkorn was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1979, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1982.

==Art market==
In 2018, Diebenkorn&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Park #126&quot; painted in 1984 became the most expensive picture by the artist auctioned when it went for $23.9 million at Christie&#x27;s New York. The previous record from 2012, also at Christie&#x27;s, was &quot;Ocean Park #48&quot; painted in 1971 for $13.5 million. At a 2014 Sotheby&#x27;s sale of Rachel Lambert Mellon&#x27;s private collection, Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani bought &quot;Ocean Park #89&quot; (1975), an abstract image of a sunset, for $9.68 million.

Author William Benton made a painting in the style of Diebenkorn&#x27;s &quot;Ocean Park&quot; for a friend who was a big admirer of the artist&#x27;s work. At the back of the painting, Benton wrote a message signed with Diebenkorn&#x27;s name. When the friend died in 1995, his estate was evaluated and an appraiser, not knowing the paintings provenance, marked the work as worth $50–60,000.

<text>Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride Corporation is an American, multi-national food company, currently one of the largest chicken producers in the United States and Puerto Rico and the second-largest chicken producer in Mexico. It exited bankruptcy in December 2009 and relocated its U.S. headquarters to Greeley, Colorado, in 2011. It is majority-owned by JBS S.A. Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride purchased Gold&#x27;n Plump for $350 million in late November 2016.

==Description of firm==
Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride is a multi-national corporation and employs about 38,000 people with sales of $8.1 billion in 2012, and has operations in 12 states, Mexico and Puerto Rico. It has the capacity to process about 36 million birds per week resulting in almost 9.5 billion pounds of live chicken annually.

Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride products are distributed primarily through foodservice and retail outlets.

Pilgrim&#x27;s traces its origins to a feed store opened in 1946 in Pittsburg, Texas, by Lonnie &quot;Bo&quot; Pilgrim and his older brother, Aubrey. They were known to give away free chicks with the bags of feed they sold, thereby expanding their business. Bo, wearing traditional Pilgrim clothing, with a pet chicken named &quot;Henrietta&quot; under his arm, was featured in Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride advertisements. He became the president of the company after Aubrey died of a heart attack in 1966. Today, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride is vertically integrated, meaning the company has its own divisions for every process from &quot;egg to table&quot;.

Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride is a supplier of Kentucky Fried Chicken and was named its &quot;supplier of the year&quot; in 1997. Other customers include Walmart, Publix, and Wendy&#x27;s. By 2012, Pilgrim&#x27;s was the exclusive rotisserie chicken supplier for Costco, supplying 50 million 3-pound marinated chickens, ready to be placed into a rotisserie.

==News events in the 2000s2020s==

On October 12, 2002, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride recalled 27.4 million pounds of sliced deli poultry after finding a strain of &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; in the drain of one of their facilities. It was the largest food recall in the US at the time. The outbreak killed 7 people, sickened 46, and caused 3 miscarriages.

In 2003, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride acquired Pierce Chicken (formerly owned by ConAgra Foods and before that part of Hester Industries). Pierce Chicken is best known for its brand-name Wing Dings, Wing Zings, and various other prepared food products.

In May 2004, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride experienced an outbreak of avian influenza in Hopkins County in northeast Texas; 24,000 breeder hens were destroyed to contain the outbreak.

On July 20, 2004, PETA released a video showing cruelty to chickens at a Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride plant in West Virginia. The video showed Pilgrim Pride employees strangling, stomping, and flinging live chickens into a wall. Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride investigated, dismissed 11 employees including managers, and has provided ongoing animal welfare training to its work force after KFC owner Yum Brands threatened to cease purchasing from the company following the incident; none of the employees faced any criminal charges.

Pilgrim&#x27;s is also a supplier of cattle feed to various ranching operations in East Texas. The supply of cattle feed was criticized because of the alleged use of &quot;inedible&quot; chicken parts being used for protein content. This is a common practice in the poultry industry known as protein conversion, so as to profit from all parts of the bird. Protein conversion uses techniques to convert inedible parts of the animal, for example keratin in feathers and skin, into digestible protein to be used for livestock and pet food.

On December 4, 2006, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride announced the successful acquisition of Gold Kist (formerly the third largest chicken company) for $21.00 a share. Although there was initial resistance from Gold Kist, the board members of both companies voted unanimously to combine the two companies.

On December 17, 2007, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride&#x27;s CEO, O.B. Goolsby Jr., died after suffering a stroke while on a hunting trip in South Texas with customers.

On April 16, 2008, after an investigation US Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided plants in Batesville, Arkansas; Live Oak, Florida; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Mount Pleasant, Texas; and Moorefield, West Virginia. Officials arrested 311 foreign national employees on suspicion of identity theft. Of those employees, 91 were formally charged.

On December 1, 2008, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride filed for bankruptcy.

On May 27, 2014, the company announced a $6.4 billion cash and debt offer to acquire the shares in Hillshire Brands. A rival bid from Tyson Foods came two days later. On June 9, 2014, the company announced it was withdrawing its bid for Hillshire after Tyson Foods had increased its offer to $8.55 billion.

On July 21, 2017, the company&#x27;s co-founder, Lonnie &quot;Bo&quot; Pilgrim, died at the age of 89.

On September 23, 2020, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride announced the appointment of Fabio Sandri as CEO, replacing Jayson Penn. Penn went on leave in June following an indictment earlier this year on charges of price-fixing and bid-rigging.
In February 2021, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride agreed to pay a $107 million fine on charges of bid rigging and price fixing.

In May 2023, undercover footage taken by Joey Carbstrong at a Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride pig slaughterhouse in the United Kingdom was released. The video shows pigs being lowered into carbon dioxide to stun the animals prior to being slaughtered. The investigation showed that many pigs remain conscious throughout the process. Campaigners described the treatment as &quot;utterly inhumane&quot;.

==Purchase by JBS S.A.==

On September 17, 2009, JBS USA Holdings, Inc. announced the purchase of 64% of the shares of Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride. JBS USA. is a subsidiary of Brazilian multinational JBS S.A., the largest meat processor in the world, and the largest by revenue. Currently JBS USA Holdings, Inc. owns 78.5% of the company.

As a result, Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride closed its corporate offices in Texas and Georgia and moved its headquarters to Greeley, Colorado. The move caused the former headquarters in Pittsburg, Texas, and a location in nearby Mt. Pleasant, Texas, to cut employment by a total of 160 people. Other locations which lost jobs included sites in Atlanta, Dallas, and Broadway, Virginia.

==COVID-19 pandemic==

In late April 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 began at the Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride plant in Lufkin, Texas. On May 8, a worker at the Lufkin plant was found dead in her home after being diagnosed with COVID-19. After the West Virginia National Guard conducted coronavirus tests of 520 (out of 940) workers at the Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride plant in Moorefield, West Virginia, 18 workers tested positive. By May 11, 2020, 194 COVID-19 cases had been diagnosed among workers at the Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride plant in Cold Spring, Minnesota, which employs about 1,100 workers. On the same day, 75 to 85 cars filled with workers drove around the plant, honking horns and demanding over a loudspeaker that it be closed for two weeks. 

At least one worker tested positive at the Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride plant in Chattanooga and other workers tested positive at the company&#x27;s plant in Timberville, Virginia, where dozens of workers protested in early April 2020. The company has declined to release the number of cases in Timberville.

<text>Sarah Ophelia Colley Cannon (October 25, 1912 – March 4, 1996), known professionally as her stage character Minnie Pearl, was an American comedian who appeared at the Grand Ole Opry for more than 50 years (1940–1991) and on the television show &quot;Hee Haw&quot; from 1969 to 1991.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sarah Colley was born in Centerville in Hickman County, Tennessee, 50 miles (80 km) southwest of Nashville. She was the youngest of five daughters born to a prosperous sawmill owner and timber dealer in Centerville.

She graduated from Ward-Belmont College (now Belmont University), at the time Nashville&#x27;s most prestigious school for young ladies, where she majored in theater studies and dance. She taught dance for the first few years after graduating.

===Professional career===
Her first professional theatrical work was with the Wayne P. Sewell Production Company, a touring theater company based in Atlanta. She produced and directed plays and musicals for local organizations in small towns throughout the Southeast.

Part of her work involved making brief appearances at civic organizations to promote the group&#x27;s shows, and during this time she developed her Minnie Pearl routine. While producing an amateur musical comedy in Baileyton, Alabama she met a mountain woman whose style and speech became the basis for &quot;Cousin Minnie Pearl&quot;. Her first stage performance as Minnie Pearl was in 1939 in Aiken, South Carolina. Her character&#x27;s now-famous trademark hat was purchased downtown at Surasky Bros. Department store before the show. The following year, executives from Nashville radio station WSM saw her perform at a bankers&#x27; convention in Centerville and gave her an opportunity to appear on the Grand Ole Opry on November 30, 1940. The success of her debut on the show began an association with the Grand Ole Opry that continued for more than 50 years.

Pearl&#x27;s comedy was gentle satire of rural Southern culture, often called &quot;hillbilly&quot; culture. She lived in the fictional town of Grinders Switch. Pearl always dressed in frilly &quot;down home&quot; dresses and wore a hat with a price tag hanging from it, displaying the $1.98 price. Her signature greeting to her audience was an elongated &quot;Howdy! I&#x27;m just so proud to be here!&quot; delivered in a hearty holler. After she became an established star, her greeting became a call-and-response with audiences everywhere. Pearl&#x27;s often self-deprecating humor involved her unsuccessful attempts to attract &quot;a feller&#x27;s&quot; attention and, in later years, her age. She also spun stories involving her comical &quot;ne&#x27;er-do-well&quot; relatives, notably &quot;Uncle Nabob&quot;, his wife &quot;Aunt Ambrosia&quot;, &quot;Lucifer Hucklehead&quot;, &quot;Miss Lizzie Tinkum&quot;, &quot;Doc Payne&quot;, and, of course, her &quot;Brother&quot;, who was simultaneously both slow-witted and wise. She usually closed her monologs with the exit line, &quot;I love you so much it hurts!&quot; She also sang comic novelty songs and often danced with Grandpa Jones.

In 1956, she made a paid appearance – $3,000, plus expenses – at the kickoff event of the first Alabama gubernatorial candidacy of segregationist George Wallace. She also appeared at an event kicking off his 1962 candidacy for governor.

Pearl drew much of her comic material from her hometown of Centerville, which she called Grinders Switch. Grinders Switch was a community just outside Centerville that consisted of little more than a railroad switch. Those who knew her recognized that the characters were largely based on actual Centerville residents. So much traffic resulted from fans and tourists looking for Grinders Switch that the Hickman County Highway Department eventually changed the designation on the &quot;Grinders Switch&quot; road sign to &quot;Hickman Springs Road&quot;.

Cannon portrayed Minnie Pearl for many years on television, first on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in the late 1950s; then on the long-running television series &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, both on CBS and the subsequent syndicated version. She made several appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. She also appeared as a celebrity panelist on game shows such as &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1977 and 1978, and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; in 1980. Her last regular performances on national television were on Ralph Emery&#x27;s &quot;Nashville Now&quot; country-music talk show on the former The Nashville Network (TNN) cable channel. With Emery, she performed in a weekly feature &quot;Let Minnie Steal Your Joke&quot; in the Minnie Pearl character, and read jokes submitted by viewers, with prizes for the best jokes.

Cannon made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, appearing at the Opry as Minnie Pearl.

===Family life===

On February 23, 1947, Colley married Henry R. Cannon, who had been an Army Air Corps fighter pilot during World War II and was then a partner in an air charter service. After the wedding, Cannon set up his own air charter service for country music performers and took over management of the Minnie Pearl character. His clients in the charter service included Eddy Arnold, Colonel Tom Parker, Hank Williams, Carl Smith, Webb Pierce, and Elvis Presley. The couple had no children. In 1969, they purchased a large estate home in Nashville next door to the Tennessee Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Cannon attended Brentwood Methodist Church, just to the south of Nashville, where she also donated the pipe organ.

===Chicken restaurants===

In the late 1960s, Nashville entrepreneur John Jay Hooker persuaded Cannon and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson to lend their names to a chain of fried chicken restaurants established to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken. The chain was known as Minnie Pearl&#x27;s Fried Chicken. After initially reporting good results and enjoying a public stock worth $64 million, the venture collapsed amid allegations of accounting irregularities and stock price manipulation. The ensuing investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission cleared both Cannon and Jackson of involvement in financial wrongdoings, but both were embarrassed by the negative publicity.

===Cancer research===
After battling breast cancer through aggressive treatments, including a double mastectomy and radiation therapy, she became a spokeswoman for the medical center in Nashville where she had been treated. She took on this role as herself, Sarah Ophelia Cannon, not Minnie Pearl, although a nonprofit group, the Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation, was founded in her memory to help fund cancer research. The center where she was treated was later named the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center, and has been expanded to at least twenty other hospitals in Middle Tennessee; southern Kentucky; Richmond, Virginia; Kansas City, Missouri; Gainesville, Florida; and the United Kingdom. Her name has also been lent to the affiliated Sarah Cannon Research Institute.

===Final years===
Cannon suffered a debilitating stroke in June 1991, bringing her performing career to an end. After the stroke, she resided in a Nashville nursing home, where she received frequent visits from music industry figures, including Chely Wright, Vince Gill, and Amy Grant. Her death on March 4, 1996, at the age of 83 was attributed to complications from another stroke. She is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Franklin, Tennessee.

==Legacy and influence==
She was an important influence on younger female country music singers and rural humorists such as Jerry Clower, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Carl Hurley, David L Cook, Chonda Pierce, Ron White, and Larry the Cable Guy. In 1992, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 2002, she was ranked as number 14 on CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Women in Country Music list.

According to Barney Hoskyns, the Band&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;Ophelia&quot; was based on Pearl. Pearl is also mentioned in the lyrics of the 1988 song &quot;Punk Rock Girl&quot; by the Dead Milkmen.

In 1988, Pearl received the American Academy of Achievement&#x27;s Golden Plate Award, presented by Johnny Cash, alongside fellow awardee Roy Acuff, at an awards ceremony in Nashville.

She was friends with performers outside the country genre, including Elvis Presley, Dean Martin (she appeared on an episode of &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;), and Paul Reubens (Pee-wee Herman). In 1992, Reubens made what would be his last appearance as Pee-wee Herman for 15 years at a Minnie Pearl tribute show.

Bronze statues of Minnie Pearl and Roy Acuff are displayed in the lobby of the Ryman Auditorium. Chely Wright and Dean Sams (of Lonestar) posed for the statues.

A museum dedicated to Minnie Pearl was situated just outside the Grand Ole Opry House at Opryland USA (next to another museum dedicated to Roy Acuff), but the museum closed along with the theme park in 1997. Many of its artifacts were moved to the adjacent Grand Ole Opry Museum.

This list includes guest appearances on other stars&#x27; albums or appearances on &quot;various artists&quot; compilation albums.

===Singles===
Minnie Pearl released a number of single records for RCA Victor during the 1950s, including a few duets with Grandpa Jones. During this period, she also made guest appearances on records by Chet Atkins and Ernest Tubb. In the 1960s, she moved to Starday Records. At age 54, she recorded a top-10 hit for Starday, &quot;Giddyup Go – Answer&quot;, a response to Red Sovine&#x27;s classic &quot;Giddyup Go&quot;. She later recorded with Sovine and Buddy Starcher in other single releases.

Pearl was back on RCA in 1974 when Archie Campbell and she released a parody record of Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty&#x27;s hit &quot;As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone&quot; which received airplay, but did not chart. In 1977, she appeared with a number of other Opry members on Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;New Harvest...First Gathering&quot; album, singing on the song &quot;Applejack&quot;. In 1986, she was a featured guest vocalist, along with Jerry Clower, on the Ray Stevens comedy single entitled &quot;Southern Air&quot;. It charted in the top 70 of &quot;Billboard&quot;.

<text>Joel Theodore Stransky (born 16 July 1967) is a South African former rugby union player. A fly-half, he is known for scoring all of South Africa&#x27;s points, including the winning drop goal, against New Zealand in the 1995 Rugby World Cup final.

==Early life==
Stransky was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, to a family from England and Czechia. He was raised in Reform Judaism and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony. He was educated at Maritzburg College where he was coached by Skonk Nicholson, a well-known figure in schoolboy rugby. After his military conscription in Pretoria, he returned to Natal to study at the University of Natal.

==Playing career==
In 1990 he was part of the team that beat Northern Transvaal to win the Currie Cup for the first time. He then moved to Italy where he played for L&#x27;Aquila during the 1991–1992 season, and for San Donà in 1992–93. Between 1993 and 1996, he won 22 caps for South Africa.

In 1995 he was part of the first South Africa team to play in a Rugby World Cup - the country had been banned from the previous World Cups because of the Apartheid regime. He played an integral part in the tournament and scored all 15 points for his team in the final against New Zealand, including a winning drop goal in the second period of extra time. This was the first Rugby World Cup final that went into extra time.

In 1997, he moved to Leicester Tigers, where he played for two seasons, winning the 1996–97 Pilkington Cup and the 1998–99 Allied Dunbar Premiership, and then became backs coach.

In the buildup to the 1999 Rugby World Cup, it was suggested that Stransky could play for England, but he discovered that he was not qualified to do so. On 20 June 1999, Stransky played for the Czech Republic in an exhibition game against Penguin International RFC, scoring 17 points.

In 2002, he was engaged by Bristol Rugby as a coach, but the offer was subsequently withdrawn. Stransky took legal action and was compensated.

=== Test history ===
 World Cup Final
==Later career==
He later returned to South Africa, and is a part-time rugby union television commentator.

In January 2007, Stransky joined Altech Netstar (Pty) Ltd. as Sales &amp; Marketing director. In January 2008, he was appointed managing director, but subsequently resigned. He was then employed by the Steinhoff Group in a marketing and promotional capacity. He founded Pivotal Capital in 2012.

==In film==
In the 2009 movie &quot;Invictus,&quot; he is portrayed by Scott Eastwood.

<doc id="690907" wikidata="Q378226" url="?curid=690907" title="Arnulf III, Count of Flanders">
<text>Arnulf III (died 22 February 1071) was Count of Flanders from 1070 until his death at the Battle of Cassel in 1071.

Born , Arnulf was the eldest son of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders and Countess Richilde of Hainaut. On his deathbed in 1070, Baldwin left Flanders to his elder son, Arnulf, and Hainaut to the younger son, Baldwin, with the provision that if either preceded the other in death, he would inherit the other&#x27;s county as well. Baldwin VI further entrusted his brother Robert with the safeguard of his son Arnulf, who was still a minor, to which Robert gave his oath of homage and solemn promise to protect his nephew. Richilde was to be regent in Flanders until Arnulf came of age.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1070, his uncle Robert broke his oath and disputed the succession. Richilde appealed to King Philip I of France, who summoned Robert to appear before him. Robert refused and continued his aggression against Richilde and Arnulf, at which point Philip amassed an army which he brought to Flanders. The French army was accompanied by Norman troops, probably sent by Baldwin and Robert&#x27;s sister Queen Matilda and led by William FitzOsborn. Also allied to Arnulf III was Count Eustace II of Boulogne who raised considerable support for the young count and his mother. The two forces met at the Battle of Cassel on 22 February 1071. In that engagement Robert&#x27;s forces were ultimately victorious but Robert himself was captured and his forces in turn captured the Countess Richilde. Both were freed in exchange and the battle continued to its conclusion. Among the dead was Arnulf, killed by Gerbod the Fleming, 1st Earl of Chester, possibly by accident. As a result of the battle Robert claimed the countship of Flanders. Richilde and her son Baldwin returned to Hainaut but continued to instigate hostilities against Robert. As he was a minor at his death and unmarried, Arnulf III had no issue.

<doc id="690909" wikidata="Q1364298" url="?curid=690909" title="Virtual airline (hobby)">
<text>A virtual airline (VA) is a dedicated hobby organization that uses flight simulation to model the operations of an airline. Virtual airlines generally have a presence on the Internet, similar to a real airline. Many hundreds of virtual airlines of significance are currently active, with tens of thousands of participants involved at any one time.

==Purpose==
Virtual airlines were started to give a sense of purpose to activities conducted within a flight simulator program, the first being SubLogic&#x27;s &quot;Flight Assignment: A.T.P.&quot;, released in 1990. As time has passed, the most common flight simulator used is Microsoft&#x27;s Flight Simulator. This basic premise has evolved over time, along with available technology, to provide increasing levels of immersion but always with the same core purpose. When combined with increasingly powerful personal computers, advancing flight simulation software, and communications networks, virtual airlines are often able to provide compelling, realistic, experiences similar to operations inside a real airline. Virtual airlines also provide an avenue for members to gain access to additional content, such as aircraft and scenery, for use with their simulator. The appeal varies; for younger members, virtual airlines provide a sandbox realistic environment where they can experience the corporate environment of traditional commercial business in the airline industry, without the risk of financial loss. These organizations also provide an outlet for those who are interested in aviation but unable to fly themselves in real life due to financial, health, or other reasons. As of 2014, an estimated 80 percent of virtual pilots hold no real world pilot&#x27;s license.

Academics have stated that members of these groups can often show significant attachment and immersion in their activity, building strong relationships with those who they share their created &quot;space&quot; with. Participants can become unusually dedicated and committed to their group through the forging of their strong bonds and sense of identity, despite the construct being entirely (or nearly entirely) fictional. Some of the groups are run similar to real-world airlines, and members can get a taste for being a professional pilot by joining one of the organizations. Commentators have described virtual aviation as giving Flight Simulators an interest and depth that they would otherwise not have.

===Scientific and academic study===
Virtual airlines have been used, both directly and indirectly, as part of research projects at universities in both aviation, modelling, and statistical theory development. It has been reported that interest in this area is increasing as of 2011, due mainly to advances in technology and the maturity of flight simulation as an industry. Enthusiasts are often of a technical background and welcome the opportunity to work with researchers, enhancing the suitability of the medium to support research initiatives.
==History==
Virtual airlines are early examples of online gaming communities, many of the first virtual airlines can be traced back to the early 1990s in flight simulator forums of services such as Prodigy, CompuServe or America Online While at least the early history of virtual airlines is predominantly on the Windows or DOS operating systems, Macintosh users also took part in the mid 1990s, with some of these still in operation today. Since they were first formed, these organizations are often characterized by their highly organized and structured nature when compared with other virtual groups in the gaming community. Such organizations represent some of the earliest examples of organized gaming groups similar to the clans and guilds seen in modern video gaming. It has been proposed that virtual airlines have existed since the creation of the first flight simulators, therefore predating the Internet.

Rapid growth in popularity of virtual airlines was experienced just prior to and through the new millennium. During this time, they were considered to be an immensely popular hobby often noted for how seriously it was taken by its participants. Since the rapid development of the massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) genre, virtual airlines and online flight simulation in general have seen much greater competition for participation and membership.

Given their origins through the early Internet, these organizations have often been early adopters of technology to enhance the online experience. This technology includes online databasing and multiplayer networks such as the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network (VATSIM), International Virtual Aviation Organization (IVAO), SkySimFlight or FSLive. Developments have tended towards more integration between Internet websites, the simulation software such as those in the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator&quot; series, multiplayer networks, and flight recording systems. It is believed that increased integration across these mediums provides a more immersive experience that enhances gameplay, being the primary reason for people to join the virtual groups. Commentators have described virtual aviation as giving Flight Simulators an interest and depth that they would otherwise not have.
While virtual airlines are not real, since the flights only happen inside of a computer, they are considered a serious hobby that has appeal among a very wide age range of participants, with the average age of participants increasing.

==Platforms==
A flight simulator (usually running on a personal computer) is required for the actual conduct of operations by organization members. There are several platforms that are typically used to conduct virtual airline operations, although by definition almost any flight simulator can be utilized by such an organization. Common simulators include: (Italicized links represent free or open-source simulators)
*X-Plane
*Lockheed Martin Prepar3D
* &quot;Flight Gear&quot;
*Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight
*Flight Simulator X
*Microsoft Flight Simulator
*Infinite Flight (Mobile)
*YSFlight
*Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020
*&quot;Roblox&quot;

==Types==
===Fictionally based===
Virtual airlines may be organizations that are created with no ties to any real world entity. These organizations are fictional constructs of the participants, who use the roleplaying environment of the group to add a sense of immersion to the gaming activity. These types of virtual airlines are indeed the most commonly seen. Without basis on a real world entity, fictional virtual airlines are varied in their scope of both route and aircraft fleet.

===Real-world===
Other virtual airlines are based on real airlines, from major carriers to small operators. These virtual airlines tend to closely follow their real world counterparts in terms of aircraft fleet and routes offered. While there are examples of controversy over copyright issues, the real airline companies tend to allow similarly named virtual airlines to participate within player communities.

===Military===

Virtual military and paramilitary organizations often operate in a similar way to virtual airlines, but using military aircraft and ranking systems. Organizations such as VATSIM have strict regulations around the operation of such organizations within the network. Virtual militaries often specialize in one area, such as naval aviation, although there are some organizations that extend across multiple areas of military aviation and sometimes into other areas such as land and maritime operations. Virtual flying clubs are less structured and generally smaller than other forms of virtual airlines, operating in much the same was as real world Flying Clubs operate. It has been proposed that such clubs have a smaller scale than others and place a heavy emphasis on social interaction.

==Operation==
Technology has improved since the introduction of BBS-operated virtual airlines, allowing a wider variety of tools and resources available to virtual pilots, enhancing realism of flight simulation. Pilots can now fly online using networks such as VATSIM, IVAO or Virtual Skies. While connected to the network, pilots can see other aircraft, hear and respond to Air Traffic Control and see weather conditions that parallel the real-world weather at their plane&#x27;s location. Using these services, most virtual airlines regularly host online events where virtual pilots can participate in group flights with hundreds of other pilots.
Some even simulate real-world airlines to the point where flight dispatching and fictional salary are part of the virtual airline&#x27;s basic operations, as well as calculating operating costs and the full range of financial data used to manage airlines in the real world. It is common for the virtual airline to offer its members set flight routes to operate, with the offer of receiving awards and promotions as a result.

===Website and forum===
There are several elements that are common across many virtual airlines but none more so than a website as the focal point of the community, typically including an Internet forum where discussion and social interaction can occur. Sometimes the community is solely based on an internet forum that is part of a flight simulation forum in general, such as Flightsim.com. From the early 21st century it became more common for virtual airlines to feature an Online database for recording and reporting flights and membership statistics. This functionality has steadily expanded in line with that of other virtual communities such as gaming clans. Flight simulation, and virtual airlines in particular, have been reported as an early adopter of new web technologies.

===Flight assignment===
It is common for virtual airlines to provide a list of flights that can be completed by members. Each flight is considered a &quot;route&quot; as part of the virtual airline&#x27;s scheduled flights. This functions in much the same way as a real airline functions, whereby they publish a list of the flights that customers can book flights on. In some virtual airlines the members can fly whichever flights they want, others the management has to assign them those flights, and in others it is possible to bid for routes they want to fly. International flights are, by virtue of the distance traveled, much longer than domestic routes and typically only available to senior members.

===Award and ranking systems===
Most virtual airlines have a specific ranking system for their pilots, that tend to involve restricting which airplanes the member is allowed to fly. Pilots complete flights for their airline, using their simulator, either online (using a network such as VATSIM) or offline, and then file a pilot report. A key aspect of these pilot reports is logging the number of hours flown, which directly affects the members promotion to other ranks. Ranking systems used typically use terminology associated with commercial aviation, such as designating senior pilots as captain. Commercial aircraft have flight crew consisting of several people, whereas in flight simulation it is rare for individual aircraft to have more than one person piloting it, therefore rank distinctions are focused on the members efforts within the organization rather than their seniority on board an individual aircraft.

Members may be motivated to complete flights in order to qualify for awards or certificates, either from completing specific routes (commonly referred to as &quot;tours&quot; in this context), or from a total number of hours completed either overall or on a specific type of aircraft. In such circumstances, profiles are provided for pilots where others can see their accomplishments and an overall roster displays an individual&#x27;s performance among others in the group.

===Airline hubs===

When a virtual airline grows to a point where managing their operations becomes difficult, the airline might subdivide into smaller groups, called a hub. The concept is similar to pilot bases in real-world airlines where pilots are grouped together at a major airport to start and end a series of flights, under the direction of a hub manager. Virtual airlines based on airlines that really exist commonly provide hubs associated with what would be expected in the real world, and follow their schedules as closely as possible.

===Livery===

It is common for pilots to be given custom aircraft files and repaints with customized livery of the airline, usually made internally by virtual airline members. In real-world airlines such a livery serves as an advertisement, establishes a sense of pride, and functions as a method for recognizing aircraft. Using Microsoft Flight Simulator the custom livery can only be seen online if other participants have installed it or use specially developed tools for model matching, such as FLAi by the Boston Virtual ARTCC, therefore the benefit is largely for the individual and their sense of realism. Liveries can be hosted on the website of the virtual airline, or more commonly provided publicly on a flight simulation site such as Flightsim.com or Avsim.com. This enables the livery to be downloaded by general flight simulation participants rather than just those involved in the airline.

===Communication===
Voice over Internet Protocol (such as TeamSpeak or Ventrillo) servers are commonly provided for members to communicate freely by voice. Participants may use Direct IP Connectivity to locate other players and communication, at least initially, is conducted by text chat. As with other online communities participants utilize chat software such as MSN Messenger, ICQ, and Skype to connected with other members, who may be distributed anywhere in the world. As of 2011, Microsoft Flight Simulator X is the only platform with a communication system embedded within its software, beyond text chat.

===Multiplayer events===

Providing opportunities for members to participate in flights together is a key aspect of being a virtual airline member. Events are held on a game network such as VATSIM, Virtual-Skies or IVAO, through a peer-to-peer multiplayer game, or on a dedicated server run by the virtual airline.

===Flight statistics and tracking===
In the 1990s virtual airlines utilized manual processes for reporting flights and tracking statistics for members, progressing through to online databases in 2000, and since 2010 the trend has been towards automated flight statistics integrated into the flight simulation software. One of these automated systems is the ACARS system, first introduced by SATA Virtual in 1999. Pilots complete their flight, say in Microsoft Flight Simulator, while connected to the internet and the software tracks the flight as well as the pilots actions. At the completion of the flight the data is sent to the virtual airlines server and then processed into the online database. This has streamlined participation and opened up new avenues for statistics and tracking, enhancing realism for those involved.

==Controversies==

===Copyright issues===
When a real-world airline is created in the image of a virtual airline, legal issues can arise out of copyright violations. In 2003, a real world airline, Qantas, announced a new low-cost carrier by the name of Jetstar Airways. However, a virtual airline named Jetstar International Airlines already existed, complete with a web site. As part of their startup promotion, Qantas sold 100,000 airline tickets at a discount price, and the virtual airline&#x27;s web site was swamped with would-be customers, job-seekers, and prospective vendors. The virtual airline sued Qantas, claiming that Qantas stole the virtual airline&#x27;s livery and trademark. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.
===Association with terrorism===
Claims have been made of the use of both flight simulators and virtual airlines as training devices for terrorist activities, although to date no conclusive link has ever been provided to indicate a situation where a virtual airline has provided flight simulation training to anyone involved in a terrorist activity.

Jermaine Lindsay, one of the four terrorists involved in the 7 July 2005 London bombings, may have used flight simulators to practice flying an airliner, with an accusation that he was registered with a virtual airline. A person of the same name listed his nearest major airport as Heathrow and clocked up 30 hours in two months with SimAirline.net. The website later denied the member&#x27;s linking with the bombing, and indicated it was working with the Metropolitan Police to establish whether its former member was the bomber. The website stated that it provides information about airlines and free add-on software for Microsoft Flight Simulator and does not provide flight instruction to its members.
The 9/11 Commission in the US concluded in 2004 that those responsible for flying the planes into World Trade Center and The Pentagon had used PC-based flight simulators for training. Despite the initial concerns of the involvement of virtual airlines in these terrorist activities, largely little has come from these claims to date and no changes have been noted as occurring in their operation as a result.

<text>Acropolis Roquepertuse is an ancient Celtic religious center. It is located near the city of Velaux, north of Marseille 16 miles west of Aix-en-Provence, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of southern France. The site was first recorded in the Bouches-du-Rhône civil statistics in 1824 when a partially buried statue of a cross-legged warrior was discovered in the garden of the parish priest. The structure was destroyed by the Romans in 124 BC and re-discovered in 1860 when a partially uncovered statue was fully excavated. Most of the excavations were done in 1923 by Henri de Gérin-Ricard.

==Excavations==

The accidental discovery of the first sculptures in the 19th century triggered the first excavation of the site by Count . A series of excavations then took place over the next ten years, from 1917 to 1927, and brought to light structures identified as a sanctuary attributed to the Celto-Ligures, initially dated to just before the Roman conquest.

Officially, the relics have now been dated to the 3rd century BC, based on Celtic expansion into the area at the time. However, the clothing and gestures of certain statues found at the site suggest that they date from the 5th or 6th century BC. These statues are distinguished by their cross-legged seated position.

A platform of 50 m by 22 m paved with flat stones including a couple of reused headstones, was discovered, divided in the middle by a staircase made of large blocks of stone. Stone walls to the left and to the right of the stairs formed a terrace, probably one of several which the complex originally had.

On the platform was what has variously been called a portal, door frame, and portico with pillars, carved of limestone. Its columns have cavities in which human stone masks, and human skulls, had been placed. Its lintel was carved with the heads of four horses, and additional decoration in paint. At the top of the lintel was a limestone statue of a bird of 60 cm by 60 cm which has been called a goose, but is now thought more likely to depict a raptor.

A two-faced androgynous sculpture of limestone (0.2 m high and 30 cm long) was also found, as well as two statues of figure sitting cross-legged(0.62 m high).

The first interpretation of archaeologists was that this was a secluded sanctuary. The latest findings from various multidisciplinary studies suggest that it was an agglomeration of about 0.5 hectares with a sanctuary to the north, as well as a bulwark for protection.

The site is important in part because it provides evidence for the Celtic head cult described in Greek and Roman accounts.

The site is near another Celtic-Roman site at Entremont, which had similar relief sculpture of severed human and horse heads, as well as skull niches carved into pillars. Nearby archaeological sites include several oppida from approximately the same period. Roquepertuse was declared a monument historique, or protected historical site, in 1967.

Roquepertuse had no domicile available for worshippers and has been used as a sanctuary where only priests may have lived permanently.

<doc id="690915" wikidata="Q4017500" url="?curid=690915" title="World Heavyweight Championship (WWE, 2002–2013)">
<text>The 2002 to 2013 version of the World Heavyweight Championship was a men&#x27;s professional wrestling world heavyweight championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE. It was the second world championship to be created by the company, after their original world title, the WWE Championship (1963). The title was one of two top championships in the company from 2002 to 2006 and from 2010 to 2013, complementing the WWE Championship, and one of three top championships from 2006 to 2010 with the addition of the ECW World Heavyweight Championship.

Established in September 2002, its creation came as a result of the WWE Undisputed Championship becoming exclusive to the SmackDown brand which left Raw without a world title due to the introduction of the brand split. Raw then created the World Heavyweight Championship and the title was awarded to Triple H. The titles moved between the brands on different occasions (usually as a result of the WWE Draft) until August 29, 2011, when all programming became full roster &quot;supershows&quot;. The World Heavyweight Championship was retired at on December 15, 2013, when it was unified with the WWE Championship with Randy Orton recognized as the final champion.

The title was one of five to be represented by the historic Big Gold Belt, introduced in 1986. Its heritage can be traced back to the first world heavyweight championship, thereby giving the belt a legacy over 100 years old, the oldest in the world.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The title&#x27;s origins lay in the first world heavyweight championship, and then to events that began in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), which had many different territorial promotions as members. In the late 1980s, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) was a member of the NWA, having been formed by the purchase of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), which had absorbed many other NWA members, by Turner Broadcasting, which aired WCW&#x27;s programming. During this time, WCW used the NWA World Heavyweight Championship as its world title. The WCW World Heavyweight Championship was soon established when the recognition was awarded to then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair in 1991. In 1993, WCW seceded from the NWA and grew to become a rival promotion to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), itself a former member of the NWA. Both organizations grew into mainstream prominence and were eventually involved in a television ratings war dubbed the Monday Night War. Near the end of the ratings war, WCW began a financial decline which culminated in March 2001 with the WWF&#x27;s purchase of selected assets of WCW.

As a result of the purchase, the WWF acquired the video library of WCW, select talent contracts, and championships among other assets. The slew of former WCW talent joining the WWF roster began &quot;The Invasion&quot; that effectively phased out the WCW name. Following this, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the WWF Championship, the WWF&#x27;s world title, at Vengeance in December. At the event, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship was decommissioned with Chris Jericho becoming the final WCW World Heavyweight Champion and the subsequent Undisputed WWF Champion after defeating The Rock and Steve Austin respectively. The WWF title became the undisputed championship in professional wrestling until September 2002 with the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship, spun off from the Undisputed WWE Championship as the successor to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.

=== Creation ===

By 2002, WWE&#x27;s roster had doubled in size due to the overabundance of contracted workers. As a result of the increase, WWE divided the roster through its two main television programs, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;, assigning championships and appointing figureheads to each brand of the same name. This expansion became known as the &quot;Brand Extension&quot;. In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Following these changes, the Undisputed WWE Championship remained unaffiliated with either brand as competitors from both brands could challenge the Undisputed Champion. Following the appointment of Eric Bischoff and Stephanie McMahon as General Managers of the Raw and SmackDown brands, respectively, Stephanie McMahon contracted then-WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar to the SmackDown brand, leaving the Raw brand without a world title. On September 2, Eric Bischoff announced the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship. Bischoff awarded the title to Triple H, who had been designated number-one contender to Lesnar&#x27;s title the previous week. Immediately afterwards, the Undisputed Championship returned to being the WWE Championship as it was no longer undisputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw9/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The World Heavyweight Championship and the WWE Championship switched brands a number of times before the first brand split ended in 2011.

=== Historical lineage ===
While introduced in 2002 as a new title, the WWE often made allusions to other titles including those of WCW and the NWA, amalgamating the history of the championship with the history of the belt that represents it. As affirmed by WWE, the World Heavyweight Championship is not a continuation of the WCW Championship, but rather its successor by way of the WWE Undisputed Championship, just as the WCW Championship spun off from the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Due to its relation to both titles, its lineage is connected with the earliest recognized world heavyweight championship. In 2009, WWE released a DVD set called &quot;History of the World Heavyweight Championship&quot; that definitively linked the title to the WCW and NWA titles.

===Title unification===

Following the end of the first brand extension in 2011, both the World Heavyweight Champion and WWE Champion could appear on both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;. In 2013, the night after Survivor Series, then-World Heavyweight Champion John Cena made a challenge to then-WWE Champion Randy Orton to determine an undisputed WWE world champion. Randy Orton defeated John Cena in a TLC match at the pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, to unify the titles. Subsequently, the WWE Championship was renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship. The unified championship retained the lineage of the WWE Championship, and the World Heavyweight Championship was retired. With his victory over John Cena, Randy Orton became the final World Heavyweight Champion. Like with the Undisputed Championship, the Big Gold Belt was used in tandem with the WWE Championship belt to represent the WWE World Heavyweight Championship until a single belt was presented to then champion Brock Lesnar in August 2014.

===Subsequent championship===

On the April 24, 2023, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H unveiled a new World Heavyweight Championship with a belt design that pays homage to the &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot;, and announced that the inaugural champion would be crowned at Night of Champions. Despite having the same name, this newer title does not carry the lineage of the 2002 to 2013 version.

== Brand designation history ==
The following is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the World Heavyweight Championship between the Raw and SmackDown brands.
== Reigns ==
The inaugural champion was Triple H, and there were 25 different champions overall. The longest championship reign was Batista&#x27;s first reign, which lasted from April 3, 2005, to January 10, 2006, for a total of 282 days. Triple H holds the record for longest combined reigns at 616 days over 5 reigns. The shortest reigning champion was Randy Orton in his fourth and final reign, who immediately retired the championship upon winning it at and unifying it with the WWE Championship. He was also the youngest champion, when he won the title for the first time at the age of 24 years 136 days during SummerSlam (2004) in August. The oldest champion was The Undertaker who won the title for the third and final time at the age of 44 during Hell in a Cell (2009) in October 2009. Edge held the title the most times with seven championship reigns between 2007 and 2011. There were six vacancies throughout the title&#x27;s history.

Randy Orton was the final champion in his fourth reign. He defeated John Cena in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match at in Houston, Texas, on December 15, 2013, to unify the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships.

<text>The Entity is a 1982 American supernatural horror film directed by Sidney J. Furie, and starring Barbara Hershey, Ron Silver, David Labiosa, Maggie Blye, Jacqueline Brookes, and Alex Rocco. The film follows a single mother in Los Angeles who is raped and tormented by an invisible poltergeist-like entity in her home. It was adapted for the screen by Frank De Felitta from his 1978 novel of the same name, which was based on the 1974 case of Doris Bither, a woman who claimed to have been repeatedly sexually assaulted by an invisible assailant, and who underwent observation by doctoral students at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Principal photography of &quot;The Entity&quot; took place over a ten week-period in Los Angeles and El Segundo, California, in the spring of 1980. Despite being completed and planned for a release in 1981, the film went unreleased until the fall of 1982, when it was acquired by 20th Century Fox and given a theatrical release in the United Kingdom. The studio subsequently released it in the United States on February 4, 1983. It grossed over $13 million at the box office against a $9 million budget. The film received moderately favorable critical reviews and acclaim for Hershey&#x27;s performance, and has received further praise from contemporary film critics.

In addition to its paranormal elements, the film deals with themes of female sexual victimhood, sexual repression, and the family dynamics of single-parent households. It was met with some controversy from women&#x27;s rights and feminist organizations during its original release due to its graphic depictions of female sexual assault.

==Plot==
One night, single mother Carla Moran is violently raped in her Los Angeles bungalow by an invisible assailant. A subsequent episode of poltergeist activity causes her to flee with her children to the home of her best friend Cindy Nash. They return to Carla&#x27;s home and the following day, Carla is nearly killed when her car mysteriously goes out of control in traffic. Urged by Cindy to see a psychiatrist, Carla meets with Dr. Sneiderman and tentatively agrees to undergo therapy. A subsequent attack in her bathroom leaves bite marks and bruises, which Carla shows to Dr. Sneiderman, who believes they are self-inflicted despite being in places impossible for her to reach.

Sneiderman drives Carla home and meets her children. She explains to him that she suffered a variety of traumas in her childhood and adolescence, including sexual molestation, teenage pregnancy, and the violent death of her first husband. Dr. Sneiderman believes her apparent paranormal experiences are delusions resulting from her past psychological trauma but agrees to keep an open mind at her request. Shortly after Sneiderman leaves, Carla is attacked again, this time in front of her children. Her son tries to intervene, but he is hit by electrical discharges and his wrist is broken.

Carla attends a staff meeting chaired by Sneiderman&#x27;s colleague, Dr. Weber. As soon as she leaves, Weber shares his belief that the experiences of the Moran household are the output of a mass delusion arising from Carla&#x27;s damaged psyche, sexual frustration and propensity to masturbate. That night, Carla is tricked by the entity into having an orgasm while she sleeps by appearing to rub &amp; suck her nipples. The next day, Sneiderman urges Carla to commit herself to a psychiatric hospital for observation, but she refuses and becomes angry when Sneiderman goes so far as to suggest she has incestuous feelings for her son.

After Cindy witnesses an attack, the two discuss possible supernatural causes. While visiting a local bookstore, Carla happens to meet two parapsychologists, whom she convinces to visit her home. Initially skeptical, they witness several paranormal events and agree to study the home under the supervision of their team leader, Dr. Cooley. During their study, Sneiderman arrives and tries to convince Carla that the manifestation is in her mind, but she dismisses him. Reassured that her case is taken seriously, Carla begins to relax. Her boyfriend, Jerry Anderson, visits one night and witnesses Carla being held down on the bed by the entity while being raped and noticeably fondled by invisible fingers. Confused and horrified, he attempts to fight off the entity. Hearing the commotion, Carla’s son enters the room and believes that Jerry is harming her, prompting him to attack Jerry. Later at the hospital, Jerry is so troubled by the experience that he ends their relationship.

Desperate for a solution, Carla agrees to participate in an elaborate experiment carried out by Cooley&#x27;s team. A full mock-up of her home is created to lure the entity into a trap and freeze it with liquid helium. Before the experiment begins, Sneiderman tries to convince Carla to leave, confirming an unorthodox personal interest in her predicament. The entity arrives but unexpectedly takes control of the helium jets, using them against Carla. She defiantly stands up to it, stating that it may kill her, but it will never have her. At this precise point, the tanks explode and flood the premises with liquid helium. Sneiderman rushes in just in time to save her. As they look back, they realize that the entity has been trapped in a huge mass of ice. It breaks free and vanishes almost immediately, but Sneiderman realizes that Carla has been telling the truth.

Dr. Cooley believes that, despite the destruction of the ice block, she has a valuable witness in Dr. Weber. Much to her chagrin, however, Weber decides to take refuge in the belief that he did not witness anything. Carla returns to her house the next day. The front door slams by itself and she is greeted by a disembodied demonic voice which says, &quot;Welcome home, cunt&quot;. She calmly opens the door, exits the house, gets in a car with her family and leaves. A closing intertitle verifies that Carla and her family have moved to Texas. Carla still experiences attacks from the entity, although they have lessened in frequency and severity.

==Cast==
==Themes==
Film scholar Daniel Kremer interprets &quot;The Entity&quot; as a parable for female sexual victimhood, citing the lead character of Carla Moran as a woman who &quot;goes head-to-head with a gaggle of men (including the &quot;entity&quot; itself). If the men of the film do not undermine her credibility or sanity, they objectify her, exploit her victimhood, belittle her ability to take control of her unfortunate circumstances, and ultimately give her the dignity of a glorified lab rat.&quot;

Brad Stevens of the British Film Institute notes that the film deals with themes of sexual assault as well as a &quot;fantasy&quot; figure that serves as a surrogate for the absent father in the household, a theme he compares to the extraterrestrial in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, released the same year. Despite some of the film&#x27;s contemporary elements, Stevens also notes that it follows a classically Gothic narrative structure. Michael Doyle, writing for &quot;Rue Morgue&quot; magazine, describes the entity in the film as akin to an incubus, a demon that sexually assaults sleeping women.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
Screenwriter Frank De Felitta adapted the screenplay from his novel, which was based on the case of Doris Bither, a woman who alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by an invisible supernatural entity on numerous occasions. The screenplay, like the novel, introduces several elements that were not investigated as part of the Bither case (including the allegations of spectral rape and the capture of an entity).

In a rare interview with &quot;Rue Morgue&quot; magazine in July 2012, director Sidney J. Furie told journalist Michael Doyle that he did not consider &quot;The Entity&quot; to be a horror film in spite of its extreme imagery, unsettling atmosphere and horrific plot. Instead, Furie said he considers &quot;The Entity&quot; to be more of a &quot;supernatural suspense movie.&quot; Furie also confessed that he intentionally avoided researching the case upon which &quot;The Entity&quot; is based as he &quot;did not want to judge the characters and story in any way.&quot; Neither he nor actress Barbara Hershey met with Doris Bither, the woman on whom the character of Carla Moran was based.

===Casting===

Several actresses were considered for the role of Carla Moran, including Jill Clayburgh, Sally Field, Jane Fonda, and Bette Midler, but all four declined the offer. Barbara Hershey was cast in the role only ten days before production was scheduled to begin. Hershey had hesitations about the part due to the nudity in the screenplay, but agreed to it after director Sidney J. Furie assured her the nude sequences would be accomplished via body doubles and mannequins. Recalling her casting, Hershey said: &quot;I was frightened. I didn&#x27;t know how it would be edited or marketed. But I knew that Sid saw potential in the film to approach the subject from a humanistic and psychiatric viewpoint, from a mother&#x27;s viewpoint...  and I felt it was a worthwhile risk.&quot; Neither Hershey nor Furie met the real Doris Bither in preparation for the film.

Ron Silver was cast as Dr. Sniderman, the psychologist who questions the supernatural nature of Carla&#x27;s attacks, while Alex Rocco was given the part of Jerry, her absent boyfriend. Furie had originally sought Craig T. Nelson for the role of Jerry, but producer Harold Schneider refused to cast Nelson. David Labiosa, a New York-based actor, was cast as Carla&#x27;s teenage son Billy, based on his performance in the television film &quot;Death Penalty&quot; (1980) opposite Colleen Dewhurst.

===Filming===
&quot;The Entity&quot; was an independent production made under a tax shelter by the newly-established production company American Cinema International Productions, and had originally been optioned to Roman Polanski. The film was financed as part of a package deal along with &quot;I, the Jury&quot; (1982) and &quot;Tough Enough&quot; (1983).

Principal photography of &quot;The Entity&quot; began in Los Angeles on March 30, 1981. The shoot lasted a period of ten weeks, and was completed in late June 1981. Furie was pleased with the small production, later commenting: &quot;There were no extras waiting in buses, no six camera crews, no bullshit. And at every point, we knew the film was working pretty well.&quot; The exteriors of the Moran home were shot at a house in El Segundo, while a set was constructed in Los Angeles for the home&#x27;s interiors. Stylistically, Furie and his cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, employed frequent use of close-ups and Dutch angles. The shoot was temporarily halted when Labiosa accidentally broke his wrist while filming a scene in which he is thrown backward by the entity. Labiosa&#x27;s injury resulted in him being written out of several scenes.

During filming, Furie excised a subplot involving overt incestuous feelings between Carla and her son, Billy. A dream sequence in the original screenplay featured Carla fantasizing about taking her son&#x27;s virginity. Labiosa recalled: &quot;I think it was awkward for everyone to do, because of what the whole thing implied. I often wonder what the film would have been like had they kept it in.&quot; According to Labiosa, a scene was filmed in which Carla observes Billy shirtless outside, which hinted at this subplot, but this scene was cut from the film.

The majority of the special effects in the film were achieved with practical methods, and were supervised by Stan Winston. For example, the scene in which Carla&#x27;s nude body is groped by the entity was shot featuring a latex dummy body with suction cups built inside, which allowed crew members to manipulate it to appear as though fingers were making impressions on her flesh; Hershey&#x27;s body, aside from her head, was hidden beneath the bed during this scene. The construction of the dummy body cost the production $65,000 to create.

The film would be among the final productions made by American Cinema Productions before it filed for bankruptcy in December 1981.

==Release==
Universal Pictures initially expressed interest in distributing &quot;The Entity&quot;, as the studio felt it might have &quot;some commercial value,&quot; but it was ultimately acquired by 20th Century Fox. The film opened first in the United Kingdom on September 30, 1982, where it was given an X rating. It opened in the United States on February 4, 1983, with little pre-publicity.

===Home media===
CBS/Fox Video released &quot;The Entity&quot; on VHS in 1983. Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2005, and later issued a standalone Blu-ray disc on July 3, 2012.

In December 2016, Eureka Entertainment released a dual format DVD and Blu-ray set in the United Kingdom in exclusive steelbook packaging, sold exclusively through Zavvi. On June 11, 2019, Scream Factory released a collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray disc of the film featuring new interviews and other newly-commissioned bonus material.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
The film grossed $3.7 million during its opening weekend in the U.S., and went on to gross a total of $13.3 million.

===Controversy===
Upon its release in the United Kingdom, the film was met by protests from women&#x27;s rights groups who deemed it offensive due to its graphic depictions of sexual assault. In response to the protests against the film, star Barbara Hershey publicly responded, telling a reporter: &quot;I resent being put in the position of defending the film. We worked really hard not to make it exploitative. Rape is one of the ugliest if not the ugliest thing that can happen to someone. It&#x27;s murder of a sort. I have no answer for those people who are offended.&quot;

===Critical response===

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 62% approval rating based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10.

Richard F. Shepard, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, praised Hershey&#x27;s performance but went on to say &quot;&quot;The Entity&quot; offers thrills in short staccato bursts and dull science in long bursts.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert, who also put the film in an 1987 episode of &quot;At the Movies&quot; about cinematic guilty pleasures, praised the film for Hershey&#x27;s performance, deeming it her &quot;comeback&quot; and describing her portrayal of a struggling single mother as &quot;touching.&quot; Bill Kaufman of &quot;Newsday&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;straightforward&quot; approach to its material, and praised both Hershey and Silver&#x27;s performances. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; championed the film, praising De Felitta&#x27;s &quot;painstaking adaptation&quot; of the source novel, and summarized the film as an &quot;intense and engrossing entertainment that unexpectedly involves a crackling battle between psychiatry and parapsychology, with poor Hershey caught in the middle...  Never has so much been demanded of Hershey, and she&#x27;s never been better.&quot;

Contemporary criticism of the film has been favorable: Andrew Dowler of the Toronto publication &quot;Now&quot; praised the lead performances, writing: &quot;Hershey gives Carla a believable mix of hopelessness and grit, and Ron Silver strikes the right note as an over-assertive psychologist who may have more than a professional interest in the case. Director Sidney J. Furie keeps them in the foreground, but uses slightly off-kilter angles to make his very ordinary settings creepy and cramped.&quot; American film theorist Michael Atkinson lauded the film, writing: &quot;There may not be, outside of David Cronenberg&#x27;s wonder cabinet, a more nitro-powered horror-movie metaphor hell than that fueling this post-&quot;Exorcist&quot; remnant...  It&#x27;s like the movie is writing its own library of fiery feminist theory. It remains unnerving and savage, arguably the most eloquent movie ever made in Hollywood about the struggle of the sexual underclass.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film a middling review, noting that &quot;a great performance by Barbara Hershey fails to save this poorly directed tale of the supernatural...  ever-inept director Sidney J. Furie is ham-handed as usual, with the camera swooping all over the place between dull bouts of psychological and parapsychological mumbo-jumbo.&quot;

Director Martin Scorsese has also remarked his appreciation for the film, and ranked it the fourth-scariest horror film of all time, above &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;.

===In other media===
Avant-garde filmmaker Peter Tscherkassky used a print of this film for his 1999 short &quot;Outer Space&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Remake==
In April 2015, it was announced that James Wan and Roy Lee were producing a remake for 20th Century Fox through their Atomic Monster and Vertigo Entertainment banners, respectively. The film would be written by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes. In a 2020 interview, Carey Hayes commented that the screenplay had been completed, but that the project&#x27;s future was undetermined following The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s acquisition of 20th Century Fox.

<doc id="690921" wikidata="Q704403" url="?curid=690921" title="Baldwin II, Count of Hainaut">
<text>Baldwin II (1056–1098?) was count of Hainaut from 1071 to his death. He was an unsuccessful claimant to the County of Flanders. He disappeared in Anatolia during the First Crusade.

==Minority==

Baldwin was the younger son of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders and Countess Richilde of Hainaut. He became count of Hainaut after the death of his older brother, Arnulf III of Flanders, at the battle of Cassel. The County of Flanders was then claimed by their victorious uncle Robert the Frisian. During Baldwin&#x27;s minority reign, which lasted until 1083, Richilde constantly fought against Robert to recover Flanders for her son, but she was unsuccessful. In order to obtain funds, she enfeoffed the county to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. With the funds obtained in the transaction, around 1072, she assembled a coalition that included the duke of Bouillon, the counts of Namur, Louvain, Montaigu, Chiny, Hautmont (Clermont, according to Reiffenberg) and others, all to no avail: Robert defeated the coalition decisively at Broqueroie.

==Family==
Baldwin married Ida, a daughter of Count Henry II of Leuven and sister of Count Godfrey I of Leuven, in 1084. Their children were:

# Baldwin III, Count of Hainaut
# Louis, living 1096
# Simon, a canon in Liège
# Henry, living 1096
# William, died after 1117
# Arnold; m. Beatrix von Ath (b. c. 1075 – before 1136), daughter of Walter von Ath and Ade de Roucy. Father of Eustace the Elder of Roeulx.
# Ida, (c. 1085 – after 1101); 1m: Guy de Chievres; 2m: c. 1100 Thomas, Lord of Coucy (also called Thomas of Marle)
# Richilde, (c. 1095 – after 1118); m. c. 1115 (div. 1118) Amaury III de Montfort. Became a nun at Maubeuge after the death of her husband.
# Aelidis, (before 1098 – 1153); m. Nicolas II de Rumigny

==Crusade==
Baldwin joined the First Crusade in the army of Godfrey of Bouillon (rather than with his nearer relative Robert II of Flanders, whose family was still at odds with his own), after selling some of his property to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. In 1098 he was sent back to Constantinople with Count Hugh of Vermandois after the siege of Antioch, to seek assistance from Byzantine emperor Alexius I. However, Baldwin disappeared during a raid by the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia, and was presumably killed. Baldwin&#x27;s fate remained uncertain for a long time. While on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1106, Baldwin&#x27;s wife Ida organized a search for her lost husband in Anatolia, which was inconclusive.

==History==
Baldwin was son of Count Baldwin II of Hainaut and Ida of Louvain. He succeeded to the County of Hainaut in 1102. Baldwin married Yolande of Guelders at a young age. He had been betrothed to Adelaide of Maurienne, a niece of Countess Clemence of Flanders. The broken betrothal caused a scandal, and Countess Clemence brought the issue before her brother Pope Calixtus II. The pope declared that the marriage was legal and could not be dissolved.

Baldwin died at a young age of in 1120, and was buried in Mons, Belgium. His eldest son, Baldwin IV, succeeded him. His younger son Gerard inherited the counties of Dodewaard and Dale, which had been in the possession of his mother. Countess Yolande held Hainaut as her dower for a while and as a regent for her son.

==Family==
He was married to Yolande, daughter of Count Gerard I of Guelders. Their children were:
# Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut, married Alice of Namur
# Gerhard of Hainaut, ancestor of the Counts of Dale
# Gertrude/Ida of Hainaut, married before 9 August 1138 to Roger III of Tosny of Conches and Flamstead
# Richildis of Hainaut, married: 1) Thierry d’Avesnes; 2) Everard II Radulf, castellan of Tournai

After Baldwin&#x27;s death, Countess Yolande married c.1120 Godfrey II, lord of Ribemont and Bouchain, castellan of Valenciennes and the son of Anselm of Ribemont. Yolande and Godfrey II had two children: 
* Godfrey III, castellan of Valenciennes
* Berthe of Valenciennes, who married 1) Count Otto II of Duras and 2) Guy de Saint-Aubert

He was buried at the monastery of Saint Waudru before the altar of Blessed James the apostle.

<text>Isabella of Hainault (5 April 1170 – 15 March 1190; also spelled: Ysabella de Hainault, Ysabelle de Hainaut or Ysabeau de Hainaut) was a Queen of France as the first wife of King Philip II. She was also formally ruling Countess of Artois &quot;de jure&quot; between 1180 and 1190.

== Early life ==
Isabella was born in Valenciennes on 5 April 1170, the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut, and Margaret I, Countess of Flanders. When she was just one year old, her father had her betrothed to Henry, the future Count of Champagne. He was the nephew of Adèle of Champagne, the queen of France. In 1179, both their fathers swore that they would proceed with the marriage, but her father later agreed to her marrying King Philip II.

== Queen of France ==
Isabella married the 15 year old Philip on 28 April 1180 at Bapaume, and brought as her dowry the county of Artois. The marriage was arranged by her maternal uncle Philip, Count of Flanders, who was advisor to the King. The wedding did not please the queen dowager, for it meant the rejection of her nephew and the lessening of her brothers&#x27; influence.

Isabella was crowned Queen of France at Saint Denis on 28 May 1180. She was a descendant of Charlemagne and the chroniclers of the time saw in this marriage a union of the Carolingian and Capetian dynasties, which was represented in her son Louis VIII.

Though Isabella received extravagant praise from certain annalists, she initially failed to win Philip&#x27;s affections owing to her inability to provide him with an heir, although she was only 14 years old at the time. Meanwhile, in 1184, Philip was waging war against Flanders; angered at seeing his wife&#x27;s father Baldwin support his enemies, he threatened to divorce her. According to Gislebert of Mons, Isabella then appeared barefooted and dressed as a penitent in the town&#x27;s churches, thus gaining the sympathy of the people. Her appeals angered them so much that they went to the palace and started shouting loud enough to be heard inside. Robert, the king&#x27;s uncle, successfully interposed; no repudiation followed, for repudiating her would also have meant the loss of Artois.

The marriage grew stronger with time and the young couple developed a genuine fondness for each other. Finally, on 5 September 1187, she gave birth to the desired son, Louis.

==Death==
Isabella&#x27;s second pregnancy was extremely difficult. On 14 March 1190, she gave birth to twin boys named Robert (who died the same day) and Philip (who died 3 days afterwards, on 17 March). Owing to complications in childbirth, she died in Paris the next day, 15 March, aged not quite 20, and was buried in the cathedral of Notre-Dame. She was mourned greatly in the capital, having been a popular queen. Her husband was not with her when she died, nor did he attend the funeral, as he was away in Normandy campaigning against Richard I of England. When Philip learnt of her death, he hastily signed a truce with Richard and returned to Paris, where he confirmed the placement of her tomb and spent several days in mourning before returning to Normandy the following week. In a letter to Pope Clement III, he wrote that he greatly missed his late wife.

Isabella&#x27;s son Louis succeeded her as Count of Artois. Her dowry of Artois eventually returned to the French crown following the death of her husband, when her son Louis became king.

==Appearance==
&quot;Queen Isabelle, she of noble form and lovely eyes.&quot; In 1858, Isabelle&#x27;s body was exhumed and measured at the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. At 90 cm from pelvis to feet, she would have stood about 1.72-1.75 m, (5&#x27;8&quot;-5&#x27;9&quot;) tall. It was during this exhumation that a silver seal (now in the British Museum) was discovered in the queen&#x27;s coffin. Little used during her lifetime, it is one of the few medieval seals with a royal connection to survive from the Middle Ages.

<text>William Marcus Henderson Rose (born 12 January 1957) is a former rugby union international full back who gained ten caps for England between 1981 and 1987.

==Career==
Rose made his debut in senior rugby while still at Loughborough Grammar School, his first appearance for Leicester Tigers came on 20 December 1975 against Bristol when he replaced club captain Robin Money who was injured, Rose played 7 times for Leicester in his first season scoring 70 points. He played the first 9 games of the next season before university began, and similarly played the first three games of the 1977/78 season, scoring five tries in what were his final matches for the club.

Rose was selected by Cambridge University for The Varsity Match in 1979, 1980, and 1981.

Rose made his debut on 7 March 1981 against at Lansdowne Road, Rose scored a try and a conversion in a 10–6 win, but was unable to take up an offer of a place on England&#x27;s 1981 England rugby union tour of Argentina as he could not defer his final university exams. Later in March that year Rose joined Coventry, where he stayed until October 1983.

On 4 April 1987 Rose scored 17 points as England beat to deny them a triple crown in the 1987 Five Nations Championship.

Rose provided colour commentary on the ESPN broadcast of the 1987 Rugby World Cup Final.

<doc id="690940" wikidata="Q209241" url="?curid=690940" title="2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine">
<text>Dimethoxybromoamphetamine (DOB), also known as brolamfetamine () and bromo-DMA, is a psychedelic drug and substituted amphetamine of the phenethylamine class of compounds. DOB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1967. Its synthesis and effects are documented in Shulgin&#x27;s book &quot;PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story&quot;.

The drug acts as a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist.

==Chemistry==
The full name of the chemical is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine. DOB has a stereocenter and &quot;R&quot;-(−)-DOB is the eutomer. This is an important finding as it is suggestive that it is targeting different receptors relative to most other phenethylamines (e.g. MDMA) where the &quot;R&quot;-isomer serves as the distomer. The toxicity of DOB is not fully known, although high doses may cause serious vasoconstriction of the extremities. DOB is one of the most potent compounds in PiHKAL; while the active dose is similar to that of DOI, another psychedelic amphetamine, DOB has been shown to have a higher efficacy in triggering downstream effects mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, making it likely to be slightly more dangerous than DOI in overdose, due to greater vasoconstrictive action. Omission of the amphetamine related α-methyl leads to 2C-B, a compound that possesses a lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor and is a weaker receptor agonist which results in drastically reduced vasoconstriction.

==Side effects==
Excessively high doses of DOB may cause diffuse arterial spasm. The vasospasm responded readily to intra-arterial and intravenous vasodilators, such as tolazoline.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
DOB is a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptor agonist. Its psychedelic effects are mediated by its agonistic properties at the 5-HT2A receptor. Due to its selectivity, DOB is often used in scientific research when studying the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily.

It is a very weak agonist of the human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and a weak agonist of the rhesus monkey TAAR1. In contrast to the serotonin releasing agent MDMA, DOB does not produce protein kinase C (PKC) activation in the brains of rodents &quot;in vivo&quot;. The PKC activation by MDMA appears to be dependent on uptake by the serotonin transporter (SERT).

DOB has been found to reduce aggression in rats.

==History==
DOB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1967. It was first described in the scientific literature in a paper by Shulgin, Claudio Naranjo, and another colleague in 1971. The of DOB, &quot;brolamfetamine&quot;, was proposed and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986. This was the same year that the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) was founded. DOB was registered with the WHO as a supposed &quot;anorexic&quot; (appetite suppressant).

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
Internationally, DOB is a Schedule I substance under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the drug is legal only for medical, industrial or scientific purposes.

====Canada====
Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine.

====Australia====
DOB is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2017). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

====Russia====
Schedule I, possession of at least 10 mg is a criminal offence.

====United Kingdom====
DOB is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

====United States====
DOB is a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law in the United States. It was scheduled in 1973.

<doc id="690946" wikidata="Q5283388" url="?curid=690946" title="District of Alyn and Deeside">
<text>Alyn and Deeside () was one of six local government districts in the county of Clwyd, north-east Wales from 1974 to 1996. There is still a parliamentary constituency of the same name.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered three former districts from the administrative county of Flintshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Buckley Urban District
*Connah&#x27;s Quay Urban District
*Hawarden Rural District, except the parish of Marford and Hoseley (an exclave, surrounded by Denbighshire) which went to Wrexham Maelor.

The government initially specified that the new district should be called Alyn-Dee, reflecting the district&#x27;s location between the River Alyn and River Dee. The neighbouring district was similarly called Delyn, combining the names of the same two rivers the other way around. The shadow council elected in 1973 requested that the name be changed from Alyn-Dee to Alyn and Deeside. The change of name was confirmed by the Secretary of State for Wales on 19 October 1973, before the new district formally came into being.

The district was abolished under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which saw Clwyd County Council and its constituent districts abolished, being replaced by principal areas, whose councils perform the functions which had previously been divided between the county and district councils. The former area of Alyn and Deeside all became part of the new Flintshire principal area on 1 April 1996.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. From 1974 until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996, political control was held by the following parties:
==Premises==
The council inherited three main offices from its predecessor authorities, and for most of the council&#x27;s existence its functions were divided between them:
*Council Chambers, Mold Road, Buckley, built in 1901, from Buckley Urban District Council
*Civic Centre, Wepre Drive, Connah&#x27;s Quay, built early 1960s, from Connah&#x27;s Quay Urban District Council
*Council Offices, Glynne Way, Hawarden, built in 1886, from Hawarden Rural District Council

In 1992 the council consolidated all its offices at a new building which it called the Civic Offices at St David&#x27;s Park in Ewloe in the community of Hawarden. After the council&#x27;s abolition ownership of the Civic Offices passed to the new Flintshire County Council, which leased the building to Unilever who renamed it &quot;Unity House&quot;. In 2018, after Unilever&#x27;s lease expired, Flintshire County Council brought the building back into civic use, renaming it &quot;Ty Dewi Sant&quot; and moving various departments there from County Hall, Mold.

<text>John of Avesnes (1 May 1218 – 24 December 1257) was the count of Hainaut from 1246 to his death.

==Life==
Born in Houffalize, John was the eldest son of Margaret II of Flanders by her first husband, Bouchard IV of Avesnes. As the marriage of Margaret and Bouchard was papally dissolved, he was considered illegitimate.

His mother was remarried to William II of Dampierre and bore more children who could claim her inheritance. Thus, John and his brother Baldwin undertook to receive imperial recognition of their legitimacy and did so from the Emperor Frederick II. On 5 December 1244, Margaret inherited Flanders and Hainaut and designated her eldest son by her second husband, William III of Dampierre, as her heir. Immediately a war, called the War of the Succession of Flanders and Hainault, was set off over the rights of inheritance, pitting John against William.

After two years of fighting, in 1246, Louis IX of France intervened to settle the conflict and granted Hainaut to John and Flanders to William. However, Margaret refused to hand Hainaut over to John. On 6 June 1251, William of Flanders was assassinated and it was shown that the Avesnes family had financed the crime. On 4 July 1253, John defeated the armies of Margaret and her second Dampierre son, Guy, at the Battle of Walcheren. Guy was imprisoned and Margaret agreed to sell her rights to Hainaut to Charles of Anjou if he would reconquer it from John. John&#x27;s brother-in-law William II, Count of Holland, who had been elected German King (or &quot;King of the Romans&quot;), was convinced to grant Hainaut (an imperial fief) and those Flemish lands within the Empire to John. Charles was defeated and King Louis, returning from the Seventh Crusade, ordered his brother to abide by his arbitration of 1246. On 22 November 1257, Guy finally relinquished Hainaut, but John died on Christmas Eve in Valenciennes.

==Family and children==
John married Adelaide of Holland in 1246 and had the following issue:
*John II, Count of Hainaut and Holland (1247–1304)
*Baldwin (born after 1247, lived in 1299)
*Joanna, Abbess of Flines (died 1304)
*Bouchard, Bishop of Metz (1251–1296)
*Guy, Bishop of Utrecht (1253–1317)
*William, Bishop of Cambrai (1254–1296)
*Floris, stadholder of Zeeland and Prince of Achaea

<text>Adelaide of Holland (; – buried 9 April 1284), was a Countess of Hainaut by marriage to John I, Count of Hainaut. She acted as the regent of the County of Holland during the minority of her nephew Count Floris V between 1256 and 1263.

She was a daughter of Floris IV, Count of Holland and Matilda of Brabant, and a sister of William II, Count of Holland and King of Germany.

== Life ==
On 9 October 1246, Adelaide married John I of Avesnes, Count of Hainaut. Like her mother, she was a patron of religious houses. Her religious interest is reflected in that three of her sons became bishops, and her one daughter became an abbess. She also insisted on a bilingual education for them.

Between 1258 and 1263, Adelaide was regent of Holland in the name of her nephew Floris V. She called herself Guardian of Holland and Zeeland (Tutrix de Hollandie et Zeelandie). After he came of age, she continued to advise him. She died in 1284 at Valenciennes, but in 1299, with the death of Floris&#x27; son John I, it was her own son John II who inherited Holland through her.

She gave Town privileges to Schiedam, which afterward had the right to be called a city. In it, she founded Te Riviere Castle, which was then the second-largest castle in Holland.

She ordered the construction of the Schielands Hoge Zeedijk, which today continues to protect 3 million inhabitants in a wide area around Rotterdam.

Jacob van Maerlant dedicated his first poem, &quot;Geesten&quot;, to Adelaide.

== Issue ==

With John I, she had the following issue:

#John II, Count of Hainaut and Holland (1247–1304)
#Baldwin (born after 1247, lived in 1299)
#Joanna, abbess of Flines (died 1304)
#Bouchard, Bishop of Metz (1251–1296)
#Guy, Bishop of Utrecht (1253–1317)
#William, Bishop of Cambrai (1254–1296)
#Floris, stadholder of Zeeland and Prince of Achaea (1255–1297)

<text>John I (1284 – 10 November 1299) was Count of Holland and Zeeland as son of Count Floris V. John inherited the county in 1296 after the murder of his father.

Shortly after his birth, after negotiations between Floris and King Edward I of England in April 1285, he was betrothed to Elizabeth, a daughter of Edward and Eleanor of Castile. Soon after this the infant John was sent to England to be raised and educated there at Edward&#x27;s court. In 1296, after the murder of John&#x27;s father Count Floris V, King Edward invited a number of nobles from Holland with English sympathies, amongst whom were John III, Lord of Renesse, and Wolfert I van Borselen.

On 7 January 1297, John married Edward&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Ipswich. Soon after this, he was allowed to return to Holland, although being made to promise to heed the council of Renesse and Borselen. Elizabeth was expected to go to Holland with her husband, but did not wish to go, leaving her husband to go alone. After some delay and spending Christmas 1297 with part of her family in Ghent, Elizabeth did join her husband in Holland in 1298.

At first Renesse acted as regent, but on 30 April 1297, John had appointed Wolfert van Borselen regent in his stead, until his fifteenth birthday. As regent, Wolfert van Borselen, pursued a policy of neutrality towards Flanders and England. He came into conflict with the city of Dordrecht and was killed there by a mob on 30 August 1299. After this Count John II of the House of Avesnes took over the regency. Count John I of Holland died at Haarlem in the same year, on 10 November, childless and only fifteen years old, reportedly of dysentery, but there were suspicions he was murdered.

With his death without descendants, and all his siblings having died young, the heirs to the county of Holland were his father&#x27;s cousins of Hainaut, sons of John&#x27;s grandaunt Adelaide of Holland. From this time to the extinction of Hainaut as an independent county, Holland was in personal union with Hainaut.

Three years after John&#x27;s death, his young widow remarried to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.

<doc id="690964" wikidata="Q1280119" url="?curid=690964" title="Battle of the Ebro">
<text>The Battle of the Ebro (, ) was the longest and largest battle of the Spanish Civil War and the greatest, in terms of manpower, logistics and material ever fought on Spanish soil. It took place between July and November 1938, with fighting mainly concentrated in two areas on the lower course of the Ebro River, the Terra Alta comarca of Catalonia, and the Auts area close to Fayón &quot;(Faió)&quot; in the lower Matarranya, Eastern Lower Aragon. These sparsely populated areas saw the largest array of armies in the war. The battle was disastrous for the Second Spanish Republic, with tens of thousands left dead or wounded and little effect on the advance of the Nationalists.

==Background==


By 1938, the Second Spanish Republic was in dire straits. The Republican Northern zone had fallen, and in the winter of 1937/38 the Republican Popular Army had spent its forces in the Battle of Teruel, a series of bloody combats in subzero temperatures around the city of Teruel, which was retaken by the Francoist army in February.

Then, the Nationalists launched an offensive in Aragon in March without giving their enemies a chance to recover. Fighting in the middle of bitter winter temperatures, the exhausted Republican army could offer only feeble resistance. By 15 April Franco&#x27;s troops reached the Mediterranean Sea at Vinaròs, cutting Republican territory in two. As a result, the Nationalist army conquered Lleida and the hydroelectric dams that provided much of the Catalan industrial areas with electricity.

Nevertheless, on 17 March 1938, after the Anschluss, the French government decided to reopen the frontier. The Republican Army in Catalonia received 18,000 tons of war material between March and mid-June and twelve new divisions were formed from Nationalist prisoners-of-war and an extended call-up, which included conscripts that ranged in age from sixteen years old, the so-called &quot;Quinta del Biberón&quot; (the baby-bottle call-up), to middle-aged fathers. A new army, the Ebro&#x27;s army, was then formed.

Meanwhile, the Francoist armies attacked the XYZ Line north of Valencia with the intention of capturing the Republican capital, instead of advancing towards Barcelona, fearing that France would enter the war in support of the ailing Republic. In response to the situation, Spanish premier Juan Negrín approved a plan by General Vicente Rojo Lluch to launch attacks against the main Francoist forces advancing towards Valencia. The purpose of the attacks was to relieve the pressure on Valencia and Catalonia, as well as to show European governments that the Republican government was still viable.

==Opposing armies==
===Loyalist Army===

In order to distract the Nationalist armies that were advancing towards Valencia, the Popular Republican Army decided upon an offensive in the lower Ebro basin. The army was large, but it lacked enough air and artillery support. The Ebro Army was formed on 15 May under Lieutenant Colonel Juan Modesto, merging the 15th and the 5th Army Corps. It would receive reinforcements from the 12th and 18th Army Corps as soon as the battle began.

====15th Army Corps====
The 15th Army Corps &quot;XV Cuerpo del Ejército&quot; was led by Manuel Tagüeña from Escaladei and was formed by the following divisions:

* 35th International Division led by Commander Pedro Mateo Merino, including the XI, XIII and XV International Brigades.
* 3rd Division, led by Commander Esteban Cabezos Morente, including the 31st, 33rd and 60th mixed brigades.
* 42nd Division, under Commander Manuel Alvarez, including the 226th, 227th and 59th brigades.
* In mid-July the 15th Army Corps was reinforced by the 16th Popular Republican Army Division of the 12th Army Corps, the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, anti-aircraft guns, armoured vehicles and army engineers.

====5th Army Corps====
The 5th Army Corps &quot;V Cuerpo del Ejército Popular&quot;, led by Lieutenant Colonel Enrique Líster, with base in Salou:

* 11th Division led by Commander Joaquim Rodríguez, including the 1st, 9th and 100th mixed brigades.
* 46th Division led by Commander Valentín González &quot;El Campesino&quot;, including the 10th, 60th and 101st mixed brigades.
* 45th Division, international division led by Lieutenant Colonel Hans Kahle, including the 12th &quot;Garibaldi&quot;, 14th &quot;Marsellesa&quot; and 139th mixed brigades.

====12th Army Corps====
The 12th Army Corps led by Lieutenant Colonel Etelvino Vega, was based at Bisbal de Falset:
* 16th Division led by Commander Manuel Mora Torres, including the 23rd and 24th mixed brigades.
* 44th Division led by Ramón Pastor, including the 140th, 144th and 145th mixed brigades.

====18th Army Corps====
The 18th Army Corps, led by Lieutenant Colonel José del Barrio acted as tactical reserve of the two first ones:

* 27th Division, led by Marcelino Usatorre including the 122nd (with its 1st Battalion, &quot;la Bruixa&quot;, 123rd and 124th mixed brigades.
* 60th Division led by Commander Manuel Ferràndiz, including the 95th, 84th and 224th mixed brigades.

==Battle==
===Republican assault===
The Republican Army spent a week preparing to cross the Ebro. According to the historian Antony Beevor, the commandos of the XIV Corps slipped across the river in order to obtain information about the Nationalist positions, and the Republican troops rehearsed the crossing in ravines and rivers on the coast. Some key players, including Ramón Rufat, explained in detail the intelligence gathering and preparation process. The Nationalist intelligence assets passed back reports to the Nationalist High Command, detailing troop movements and the concentration of the International Brigades, as well as the presence of rafts and pontoon bridges on the other side of the river, but Franco thought that the Republican Army would not be ready to undertake an offensive across the Ebro.

For the crossing, the Republicans chose the bend of the Ebro River between Fayon and Benifallet, an area held by the 50th Division of the Nationalist Army. The Republican army started the crossing on the night of 24–25 July during a no moon period. Republican commandos crossed the river, killed the Nationalist guards and fastened lines for the assault boats, then the first Republican troops crossed in ninety boats (each of which carried ten men). The remaining troops of the V and XV Corps crossed the next day, using three pontoon bridges and another 12. The surprise was total and Republican forces were initially successful. Nevertheless, a secondary assault near Amposta, carried out by the XIV International Brigade, failed after 18 hours of combat, and the XIV International Brigade retreated, after suffering huge losses.

During the first day, Republican troops surrounded the troops of the Colonel Campos’s 50th Division, taking 4,000 prisoners, and many other Nationalist soldiers deserted. By the evening, Tagueña had advanced three miles in the north and Lister twenty one in the center. By 26 July, the Republican troops had occupied 800 square kilometres and reached the outskirts of Gandesa; nevertheless the Nationalists deployed Barron’s 13th Division in the town and the Republican troops failed to occupy it.

Then, Franco decided to send heavy reinforcements to the Ebro’s front (eight divisions, more than 140 bombers and 100 fighters) and passed the order for the dams at Tremp and Camarasa to be opened. The flood water destroyed the pontoon bridges, although the Republican engineers managed to repair them within two days. Furthermore, the &quot;Condor Legion&quot; and the &quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot; started to bomb and destroy the pontoon bridges each day, although the Republican engineers managed to repair them each night. Because of this, only 22 tanks and a handful of artillery managed to cross the Ebro River, and Republican troops began running low on supplies, ammunition and drinking water.
===Siege of Gandesa===

The key target for the Republicans was the town of Gandesa, some 25 km west of the Ebro, a crossroads to Catalonia and the north-south roads running parallel to the Ebro. The terrain around the town was extremely hilly, being dominated by the &quot;Cavalls&quot;, &quot;Pandols&quot; and &quot;Fatarella&quot; mountain ranges whose hard and bold limestone rocks and scant forest cover provided little shelter against Francoist fire.

On 27 July, Modesto ordered an attack on Gandesa with T-26 tanks and on 30 July decided to concentrate his tanks and artillery around Gandesa and launched an infantry assault against the city. On 1 August, the XV International Brigade launched a fierce attack against Hill 481 in front of Gandesa, suffering huge casualties; nevertheless, the Republican assault had failed due to the Nationalist air and artillery superiority and Modesto ordered the Army of the Ebro to go on the defensive.

===Battle of attrition===
After the end of the Republican offensive, the Republican army of the Ebro was trapped in a pocket with its back to a river and Nationalist officers wanted to attack across the unprotected Segre River and advance to Barcelona, but Franco wanted to destroy the Republican Army of the Ebro and to recover the lost territory. The Nationalists concentrated most of their artillery and air forces in the Ebro&#x27;s Front. On the other hand, the Republican high command ordered their troops to resist and not to retreat. Officers and men were executed for retreating.

The battle was fought by both sides as a World War I Western Front style battle, with each side launching bloody frontal assaults on enemy positions in what became a war of attrition. The Nationalist tactic was to use artillery and aerial bombardment in small areas to soften resistance and then to launch a frontal assault with one or two infantry battalions to occupy the area. Each day 500 cannons fired more than 13,000 rounds at the Republican troops and more than 200 Nationalist aircraft dropped 10,000 pounds of bombs. Nevertheless, the Republican troops fought with stubborn bravery and repelled the Nationalist assaults with barrages of machine-gun and mortar fire. In many zones, the terrain was too hard to dig trenches or foxholes, and as the August heat became unbearable (on 4 August it was 37°C in the shade), the shortages of water and food grew worse for the Republican troops. The situation was made more desperate by the relentless bombing that the Republican troops endured from dawn to dusk, which made it impossible for bodies to be buried, and meant that the wounded could only be evacuated at night, by small boats.

The key to the battle was Nationalist air superiority, provided by the Italian &quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot; and German &quot;Condor Legion&quot; squadrons that flew under the &quot;Aviación Nacional&quot; markings. Some 500 first class planes were available on the Nationalist side (Savoia SM-79, Savoia SM-81, BR.20, He 111, Do 17, Ju 52 and 6 Ju 87 bombers, and Bf 109 and CR.32 fighters) against only some 35 modern fighters and some 40 second class aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force. In July, the Legion Condor had destroyed 76 Republican planes and by August the Republican Air Force had lost air superiority in the area. The Republican planes were outnumbered by at least two to one, and most of the experienced Soviet pilots had been withdrawn. Republican anti-aircraft defenses proved to be inadequate and many planes were destroyed on the ground. The Nationalists used their bombers to cut the pontoon bridges on the Ebro, and as a flying artillery to smash the Republican positions in the sierras, and to destroy their supply lines: &quot;Republican communications were bombed to oblivion and, as so many international brigader memoirs testify, their troops were blasted off the bare and rocky hillsides by the sheer force of the incendiary materiel launched.&quot;

===Nationalist counteroffensive===

The Nationalist forces launched six counter-offensives in order to retake the territory seized by the Republicans. The first counteroffensive was launched on 6 August against the northern republican held pocket between Mequinenza and Fayón. The Legion Condor dropped 50 tons of bombs and by the 10 August the Republican troops were forced back across the river. The Republicans had lost 900 men and 200 machine-guns. On 11 August the Nationalists led by Camilo Alonso Vega launched an attack against the &quot;Pandols Range&quot; held by the Lister&#x27;s 11th Division. By 14 August the Nationalists had occupied the high point of Santa Magdalena, but the Republicans held the Sierra. On 18 August the Nationalists opened again the dams on the Segre River, destroying the pontoon bridges at the Ebro and on 19 August General Juan Yagüe with six divisions and supported by the &quot;Legion Condor&quot; advanced from &quot;Villalba del Arcs&quot; and captured the heights of Gaeta after five days of fierce fighting. The slow advance of the Nationalists infuriated Mussolini: &quot;Today 29 August, I predict the defeat of Franco. That man does not know to make war or doesn&#x27;t want to&quot;.

Then Franco decided to send Garcia Valiño&#x27;s Maestrazgo Corps to the front and on 31 August the Nationalists launched an attack against the &quot;Cavalls Range&quot; in order to advance towards Corbera. The mountain range was held by the 35th, 11th and the 43rd Republican divisions, and the Nationalists attacked with eight divisions, 300 guns, 500 aircraft and 100 tanks. On 3 September the Nationalists launched a new attack from Gandesa supported by German 88 mm guns and by 4 September the Nationalists had occupied Corbera. Then Yagüe&#x27;s forces broke the Republican lines, but Modesto sealed the breach with the 35th Division and ordered their troops to hold on: &quot;Not a single position must be lost. If the enemy takes one, there must be a rapid counterattack and as much fighting as necessary, but always making sure that it remains in republican hands. Not a metre of ground to the enemy!&quot; After six weeks of combat the Nationalists had recovered 120 square miles. On the other hand, on 21 September the Republican prime minister, Juan Negrin, announced the unconditional withdrawal of the International Brigades.

On 2 October the Nationalists occupied the heights of Lavall and two weeks later Point 666, the key of the Pandols Range. On 30 October the troops of the Garcia Valiño&#x27;s Army Corps of the Maestrazgo, led by Mohammed el Mizzian, attacked the heights of the Cavalls Range, supported by 175 guns and 100 aircraft. The Republicans lost the heights after one day of combat, suffering huge casualties (1,000 prisoners and 500 dead), despite the support of 100 fighters. On 2 November the Nationalists occupied the Pandols Range and on 3 November the right flank of the Nationalist forces reached the river Ebro. On 7 November Móra la Nova fell and by 10 November the Nationalists had occupied Mount Picossa. On 16 November the last men of the 35th recrossed the Ebro at Flix and the battle ended.

==Aftermath==

The Nationalists&#x27; superiority in manpower and equipment meant that they were better able to withstand the losses and to exhaust the Republicans. As a result of the Battle of the Ebro the Republican army was destroyed as an effective force, and the Republican air force was no longer capable of offering further resistance.

Both sides had suffered huge losses, with estimates ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 to 110,000 casualties, as well as the loss of large numbers of aircraft (the Republicans between 130 and 150). The Nationalists had lost most of their best officers and most of their tanks and lorries needed repairs or spare parts, and the Republican army had lost most of its weapons and experienced units. Nevertheless, after Franco signed a new mining law that made huge concessions to the German government, Germany sent new weapons to the Nationalist forces and in December, Franco launched an offensive against Catalonia.

Antony Beevor has argued that Negrín&#x27;s &quot;active war policy&quot; of attacking, rather than adopting strong defences and hoping for a wider European conflict or harrying the Nationalist forces, had been driven primarily by the Communist Party of Spain&#x27;s desire for propaganda victories and that at the Battle of the Ebro, the policy destroyed the Republican army for no great purpose. The Republicans accomplished none of their strategic objectives and, according to Beevor, were unwilling to apply the theory of the deep operations to their attacks. Thus, their forces spent a long time clearing Nationalist secondary defensive positions, which allowed the highly-mechanised Nationalist forces to deploy in strong defensive positions quickly.

Nevertheless, Paul Preston and Helen Graham said that the Republicans, by launching the Battle of the Ebro, stopped the Nationalist assault on Valencia, inflicted huge losses on the Nationalist army and prolonged the war several months. However, the Munich Agreement removed any hope of aid from the Western democracies and turned the political victory into a resounding military defeat.

A well-known Republican song, &quot;¡Ay Carmela!&quot;, commemorates the battle.

<text>John II (1247 – 22 August 1304) was Count of Hainaut, Holland, and Zeeland.

==Life==
John II, born 1247, was the eldest son of John I of Hainaut and Adelaide of Holland. He became Count of Hainaut on the death of his grandmother, Countess Margaret I of Hainaut. John continued the war between the House of Dampierre and the Avesnes family against Count Guy of Flanders for Imperial Flanders.

John II became Count of Holland in 1299 upon the death of his cousin John I. The personal union he established between Hainaut and Holland–Zeeland lasted for another half-century. John I&#x27;s father, Floris V, had been fighting against Flanders for Zeeland. He sought help of France against Flanders. The French defeated the Flemish in 1300 and 1301. The rebels in Zeeland were defeated as well. John&#x27;s brother, Guy of Avesnes, became bishop of Utrecht. Thus, all his main enemies were gone.

The tide changed dramatically after a Flemish uprising and the defeat of the French army at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302, where John&#x27;s eldest son was killed fighting for the French. The Flemish attacked Hainaut and Zeeland supported by the dissatisfied population there. Guy of Namur defeated John&#x27;s son, William, in a battle on the island of Duiveland. Bishop Guy of Utrecht was taken prisoner. Guy of Namur and Duke John II of Brabant conquered most of Utrecht, Holland, and Zeeland. Guy of Namur was finally defeated in 1304 by the fleet of Holland and France at the naval Battle of Zierikzee. John II regained most of his authority when he died in the same year.

==Family==
In 1270, John married Philippa, daughter of Count Henry V of Luxembourg and Margaret of Bar. Their children were:
# John, Lord of Beaumont, Count of Ostervant. Killed in battle (11 July 1302).
# Henry, a canon in Cambrai, (died 1303).
# William I, Count of Hainaut ( – 7 June 1337) He succeeded his father in 1304. Married Joan of Valois, daughter of Charles, Count of Valois.
# John of Beaumont (1288 – 11 March 1356). He was married to Margaret, Countess de Soissons.
# Margaret (died 18 October 1342), married Robert II of Artois, who was killed at the Battle of the Golden Spurs, 11 July 1302.
# Alice or Alix (d. 26 October 1317), who married 1290 Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, by whom she had no issue.
# Isabelle (died 1305), married Raoul de Clermont Lord of Nesle, who was killed in battle at the Battle of the Golden Spurs, 11 July 1302.
# Joan, a nun at Fontenelles.
# Mary of Avesnes (1280–1354), married Louis I, Duke of Bourbon.
# Matilda, Abbess of Nivelles.

John&#x27;s illegitimate children were:
# Willem de Cuser
# Aleid van Zandenburg, who was married firstly to Wolfert II of Borselen, lord of Veere, and secondly to Otto III of Buren.

<doc id="690966" wikidata="Q1346976" url="?curid=690966" title="J. P. Donleavy">
<text>James Patrick Donleavy (23 April 1926 – 11 September 2017) was an American-Irish novelist, short story writer and playwright. His best-known work is the novel &quot;The Ginger Man&quot;, which was initially banned for obscenity.

==Early life==
Donleavy was born in Brooklyn, to Irish immigrants Margaret and Patrick Donleavy, and grew up in the Bronx. His father was a firefighter, and his mother came from a wealthy background. He had a sister, Mary Rita, and a younger brother. He received his education at various schools in the United States, then served in the US Navy during World War II. After the war ended, he moved to Ireland. In 1946 he began studying bacteriology at Trinity College Dublin, but left in 1949 before taking a degree.

==Career==
Donleavy&#x27;s first published work was a short story entitled &quot;A Party on Saturday Afternoon&quot;, which appeared in the Dublin literary periodical &quot;Envoy&quot; in 1950. He gained critical acclaim with his first novel, &quot;The Ginger Man&quot; (1955), which is one of the Modern Library 100 best novels. The novel, of which Donleavy&#x27;s friend and fellow writer Brendan Behan was the first person to read the completed manuscript, was banned in Ireland and the United States by reason of obscenity. The Ginger Man was known for its outspoken and comic lewdness. Lead character Sebastian Dangerfield was in part based on Trinity College companion Gainor Crist, an American Navy veteran also studying at Trinity College on the G.I. Bill, whom Donleavy once described in an interview as a &quot;saint&quot;, though of a Rabelaisian kind.

Correctly or incorrectly, his initial works are sometimes grouped with the kitchen sink artists as well as the &quot;Angry Young Men&quot;. Another novel, &quot;A Fairy Tale of New York&quot;, provided the title of the song &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;.

In March 2007, Donleavy was the castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

In 2015, Donleavy was the recipient of the Bob Hughes Lifetime Achievement Award at the Bord Gáis Energy Irish Book Awards.

In 2016, Trinity College Dublin awarded him with an honorary doctorate.

==Personal life==
Donleavy declared himself to be an atheist at the age of 14. In 1946, he married Valerie Heron; the couple had two children: Philip (born 1951) and Karen (born 1955). They divorced in 1969 and he remarried in 1970 to Mary Wilson Price; that union ended in divorce in 1989. In 2011, it was reported that Donleavy had not fathered his two children with Price. A DNA test in the early 1990s had confirmed that Rebecca was the daughter of brewing scion Kieran Guinness, and Rory was the son of Kieran&#x27;s older brother Finn, whom Price married after her divorce from Donleavy. &quot;My interest is only to look after the welfare of the child,&quot; Donleavy told &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;and after a certain stage, you can&#x27;t worry about their parentage&quot;.

He lived at Levington Park, a country house on directly on Lough Owel, near Mullingar, County Westmeath, from 1972. Throughout much of his life, he was known as Mike by close friends, though the origins of this nickname are unclear.

Donleavy died on 11 September 2017, aged 91.

<text>William the Good (, ; – 7 June 1337) was count of Hainaut (as William I), Avesnes, Holland (as William III), and Zeeland (as William II) from 1304 to his death.

==Career==

William, born , was the son of John II, Count of Hainaut, and Philippa, daughter of Henry V, Count of Luxembourg. He was the brother of John of Beaumont and Alice of Hainault.

William was originally not expected to become count. After the deaths of his elder brothers, John (killed at Kortrijk in 1302) and Henry (d. 1303), he became heir apparent to his father&#x27;s counties.

Prior to becoming count, he was defeated by Guy of Namur at the battle on the island of Duiveland in 1304. Guy and Duke John II of Brabant then conquered most of Zeeland and Holland, but these territories were recovered again when William became the new count in the same year. William continued the war with Flanders until the Peace of Paris in 1323, during which the Count of Flanders renounced all claims on Zeeland. William, in turn, gained all of Zeeland but agreed to renounce all claims on Imperial Flanders. William had occupied most of the Bishopric of Utrecht and tried to conquer Friesland but was repelled by Hessel Martena. At the death of his uncle, Guy d&#x27;Avesnes, Bishop of Utrecht, William took his fief of Amsterdam and annexed it to Holland.

Many of his daughters married with important rulers of Europe; King Edward III of England and Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV were married to his daughters, while he was married to the sister of the King Philip VI of France. With these important alliances William gained considerable influence and respect, which he used to advance the interests of his counties.

==Family==

On 19 May 1305 William married Joan of Valois, sister of the future king Philip VI of France, and had the following children:
*William II, Count of Hainaut (1307–1345)
*John (died 1316)
*Margaret II, Countess of Hainault (1311–1356), married Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor
*Philippa of Hainault (c. 1313–1369), married King Edward III of England
*Agnes (died 1327)
*Joanna of Hainaut (1315–1374), married William V, Duke of Jülich
*Isabelle of Hainaut (1323–1361), married Robert of Namur
*Louis (1325–1328)
*Jan Aelman (1320–1389) Illegitimate son and Knight

<text>Three scripts are currently used for the Tatar language: Arabic (in China), Cyrillic (in Russia and Kazakhstan) and Latin (Tatars of Turkey, Finland, the Czech Republic, Poland, the USA and Australia use the Tatar Latin alphabet at present).

==History of Tatar writing==

Before 1928, the Tatar language was usually written using alphabets based on the Arabic alphabet: İske imlâ alphabet before 1920 and Yaña imlâ alphabet in 1920–1927. Some letters such as چ and پ were borrowed from the Persian alphabet and the letter ﯓ (called &quot;nef&quot; or &quot;sağır kef&quot;) was borrowed from Chagatai. The writing system was inherited from Volga Bulgar.

The most ancient of Tatar literature (&quot;Qíssai Yosıf&quot; by Qol-Ğäli, written in Old Tatar language) was created in the beginning of the 13th century. Until 1905 all literature was in Old Tatar, which was partly derived from the Bolgar language and not intelligible with modern Tatar. Since 1905 newspaper publishers started using modern Tatar. In 1918 the Arabic-based alphabet was revised: some new letters for Tatar sounds were added and some Arabic letters deleted. The Latin-based Jaꞑalif alphabet was in use between 1928 and 1939 and the Cyrillic-based alphabet has been used ever since.

Some scholars regard &quot;Institutiones linguae Turcicae libri quator&quot; (&quot;The Basic Rules of the Turkic Language&quot;), written in Latin by Hieronymus Megiser and printed in Leipzig in 1612, being the first example of a Turkic text printed in Arabic script, as a first printed Tatar book. Meanwhile Hieronymus Megiser’s &quot;Chorographia Tartariae&quot; published in 1611 describes a unique Tartarian alphabet and cites the Lord’s Prayer in the Tartarian language, written in Latin script. The first Turkic-Tatar printed publication in Russia appears to be Peter the Great&#x27;s &quot;Manifest&quot;, printed in Arabic script and published in Astrakhan in 1722.

Printed books appeared en masse in 1801 when the first private typography (&quot;Oriental typography&quot;) in Kazan appeared.

The first unsuccessful attempt to publish a Tatar newspaper was in 1808, when professor of mathematics at Kazan University, I.I. Zapolsky, proposed publishing a newspaper &quot;The Kazan News&quot; in both Russian and Tatar languages. Zapolsky&#x27;s untimely death in 1810 thwarted the project. The first successful attempt to publish a newspaper in Tatar was in 1905. On September 2, the first issue of the newspaper &quot;Nur&quot; was published in St. Petersburg by Gataulla Bayazitov. The second Tatar newspaper, &quot;Kazan Muhbire,&quot; came into existence on October 29, 1905. The publisher of the newspaper was a member of the Kazan City Council, Saidgirey Alkin.

The first Tatar typewriter was created in Tatarstan in the 1920s and used the Arabic-based alphabet.

In 1930s Turkey became a potential enemy of the Soviet Union. Even though Turkish alphabet, introduced in 1928, was different from Jaꞑalif, for Soviet officials the Latin script was a symbol of the Western world. This motivated switching all Turkic languages of the USSR to Cyrillic script.

This was not the first project of introducing Cyrillic script for the Tatar language. Since 1861, the Keräşens ethnic group had used Nikolay Ilminsky&#x27;s alphabet, based on pre-1917 Russian orthography which used fita and dotted I to spell Orthodox proper names, additional Cyrillic letters Ӓ, Ӧ, Ӱ for Tatar vowels, and the ligature Ҥ for . This alphabet is related to the Mari alphabet, and was used because Christian Tatars couldn&#x27;t use the Arabic script. By the 1930s, Ilminsky&#x27;s alphabet was forgotten and could not be used due to its religious origin. In 1938 professor M. Fazlullin introduced an adaptation of the Russian alphabet for the Tatar language, without any additional characters. Tatar sounds absent from Russian were to be represented with the digraphs Жь, Нь, Хь, Аь, Уь, Оь, Ый.

In 1939 Qorbangaliev and Ramazanov offered their own projects that planned to use additional Cyrillic characters. Letters Ө, Ә, Ү, Һ were inherited from Jaꞑalif, but Җ and Ң were invented by analogy with Щ and Ц. ⟨Гъ⟩ and ⟨къ⟩ were suggested to designate and , spelled in Jaꞑalif as ⟨ƣ⟩ and ⟨q⟩ correspondingly. In Ramazanov&#x27;s project (Jaꞑalif ⟨v⟩) was spelled as ⟨в⟩ before a vowel, and as ⟨у⟩ or ⟨ү⟩ in the end of a syllable. On 5 May 1939, Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Tatar ASSR issued the decree &quot;On switching Tatar writing from the Latin-based alphabet to an alphabet based on Russian glyphs&quot;, which opened with a declaration that the switch was enacted &quot;in response to numerous requests by Tatar workers, kolkhozniks, and intelligentsia.&quot; The Tatar society disagreed to this project, and during a conference in July 1940, the Cyrillic alphabet was amended. The updated alphabet was accepted on 10 January 1941.

 and are allophones of and in the environment of back vowels, and the accepted spelling doesn&#x27;t explicitly distinguish between the allophones in each pair. When ⟨га/го/гу/гы/ка/ко/ку/кы⟩ is followed by a &quot;soft syllable&quot;, containing one of the front vowels ⟨ә, е, ө, и, ү⟩ or the soft sign ⟨ь⟩, they are pronounced as [ʁæ/ʁɵ/ʁy/ʁe/qæ/qɵ/qy/qe], otherwise as [ʁɑ/ʁo/ʁu/ʁɤ/qɑ/qo/qu/qɤ]. ⟨гә/гө/гү/ге/кә/кө/кү/ке⟩ are pronounced as [ɡæ/ɡɵ/ɡy/ɡe/kæ/kɵ/ky/ke]. Similar rules apply to ⟨е, ю, я⟩ which could be pronounced as either [je, jy, jæ] or [jɤ, ju, jɑ]. The soft sign is not used to show palatalization as in Russian, but to show qualities of vowels where they are not determinable through vowel harmony. Unlike modern Russian, some words can end with ⟨гъ⟩, representing after a front vowel, as in ⟨балигъ⟩ [bɑliʁ] (&quot;baligh&quot;). In total, the Tatar Cyrillic script requires the Russian alphabet plus 6 extra letters: Әә, Өө, Үү, Җҗ, Ңң, Һһ. All Russian loanwords are written as in Russian and should be pronounced with Russian pronunciation.

The complexity of the orthographic rules had led to discussions about amending the Tatar Cyrillic alphabet again; these included sessions in the Kazan branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (KFAN) which were conducted in January 1954 and in February–March 1959, but did not result in any specific proposal for a new alphabet. In 1972, prof. Nikolai Baskakov suggested three new letters to be added to the Tatar Cyrillic alphabet: Қ, Ғ and Ў for the sounds , and , to make the Tatar spelling phonetic. On 18 May 1989, the Orthographic Commission formed by the KFAN published the new alphabet, which included Baskakov&#x27;s three new letters, and the new spelling rules. The new alphabetic order was as follows, with the new letters shown in brackets:

: А Ә Б В [Ў] Г [Ғ] Д Е (Ё) Ж Җ З И Й К [Қ] Л М Н Ң О Ө П Р С Т У Ү Ф Х Һ Ц Ч Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Я

The spelling system of 1940 had led to many homographs and near-homographs between Tatar and Russian which had totally different pronunciation, e.g. ⟨гарь⟩ [ʁær] &quot;shame&quot; and ⟨гарь⟩ [ɡarʲ] &quot;cinder&quot;. This presented difficulties for pupils learning the two spelling systems for the two languages simultaneously. One of the goals for the new spelling system was that the same sequence of letters would correspond to the same sounds, whether in a Russian word or in a Tatar word. Yet, the amended orthography was never formally adopted, as the popular opinion in the 1990s leaned towards switching to a Latin-based alphabet, instead of changing the Cyrillic one. Thus, on 20 July 1994, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Tatarstan approved a gradual transition to Latin-based script; the urgency of such transition was included in the resolution of the Second World Congress of the Tatars in 1997. Recognizing the popular demand, on 15 September 1999, the State Council of the Republic of Tatarstan issued the decree &quot;On restoring the Tatar alphabet based on Latin glyphs&quot;. Despite the name of the decree, the new Latin alphabet was significantly different from Jaꞑalif, and its letters had one-to-one correspondence with the proposed Cyrillic alphabet from 1989. On 27 September 2000, the Cabinet of Ministers updated the new Latin alphabet, replacing the three uncommon characters inherited from Jaꞑalif (Ə, Ɵ, Ꞑ) with those present in Latin-1 encoding and in most computer fonts.

==Correspondence between alphabets==

Before the 1980s, in the listing of the alphabet, extra letters were placed after the Russian ones, as shown above. The Tatar Parliament changed the alphabetic order in January 1997 to the one shown below.

== Cyrillic version ==
The official Cyrillic version of the Tatar alphabet used in Tatarstan contains 39 letters:

А Ә Б В Г Д Е (Ё) Ж Җ З И Й К Л М Н Ң О Ө П Р С Т У Ү Ф Х Һ Ц Ч Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Я

=== Letter names and pronunciation ===
Due to the Russian Federal law, only Cyrillic alphabets may have official status in regions of the Russian Federation. There is ongoing confrontation with regards to adoption of the Latin script for the Tatar language.

== Latin version ==
According to the decree &quot;On restoring the Tatar alphabet based on Latin glyphs&quot; from 1999, the new Latin alphabet would be in official use alongside the Cyrillic alphabet from 1 September 2001, and would become the sole alphabet in official use by 1 September 2011. Around the same time, the Republic of Karelia was pursuing official status for Karelian language, which also uses a Latin-based alphabet. The Russian State Duma perceived the latinization of the two republics as a variety of language secessionism, and on 15 November 2002, they introduced an amendment into the law &quot;On the languages of the peoples of the Russian Federation&quot; stating that all official languages of the republics within the Russian Federation must use Cyrillic alphabets.

The Republic of Tatarstan challenged the amendment in the Constitutional Court of Russia, arguing that the State Duma doesn&#x27;t have authority over the language policies of the constituent republics. On 16 November 2004, the Constitutional Court declined the appeal. To comply with the court&#x27;s decision, the decree &quot;On restoring the Tatar alphabet based on Latin glyphs&quot; was officially rescinded on 22 January 2005.

On 24 December 2012, a new Tatarstani law clarified that the new Latin alphabet, as specified in 2000, should be used as the official romanization for the Tatar language. It also specified Yaña imlâ as the official system for transliteration into the Arabic script. According to this law, requests to Tatarstani authorities may use the Latin and Arabic scripts, but the authorities&#x27; answers would be written in Cyrillic, with an optional transliteration into the other alphabets. As of 2020, Cyrillic remains the only official script in Tatarstan.

Zamanälif-2 (Tatar for &quot;modern alphabet&quot;) contains 34 letters:

A, Ä, B, C, Ç, D, E, F, G, Ğ, H, I, İ, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, O, Ö, P, Q, R, S, Ş, T, U, Ü, V, W, X, Y, Z.

There are 10 vowels and 25 consonants. In addition to the ISO basic Latin alphabet, the following 9 letters are used: Çç, Ğğ, Şş, Ññ, Ää, Öö, Üü, Iı, İi.

Tatar vowels are: a/ä, o/ö, u/ü, ıy/i, ı/e.

The symbol {{angbr|&#x27;}} is used for the glottal stop (known as &quot;hämzä&quot; in Tatar).

Tatar writing is largely phonetic, meaning that the pronunciation of a word can usually be derived from its spelling. This rule excludes recent loanwords, such as &quot;summit&quot; and names.

In 2024, the modified Common Turkic Alphabet replaced letter ä with ə, which was already in use in Azerbaijani, as well as among Tatar activists using the Latin alphabet. This way of writing has been named as &quot;Neo-alif&quot; (Neo-əlif) by some Tatar activists. It disregards letter ä mainly due to its abundant occurrence in Tatar words compared to the other umlaut letters, creating an &quot;undesired aesthetic outcome&quot;. (Compare: kübäläklär –&gt; kübələklər; &#x27;butterflies&#x27;).

&quot;Tatarça Diktant&quot;, a global event organized in 2024, had recitations of Tatar poems that were translated into the Latin Neo-alif alphabet. The event was sponsored by official bodies such as the Ministry of Youth of Tatarstan and Kazan Federal University. Its purpose was &quot;aimed at uniting lovers of the Tatar language, increasing interest in writing correctly and learning the literary Tatar language&quot;.

In Finland, while ä is found in Finnish, the Tatar community has traditionally tried to use only letters found in Turkish, and thus, have replaced it with e. This has left both the [e] and [ɯ] (ı) sounds as ı (keçkenä / keçkenə, &quot;kıçkıne&quot;; &#x27;small&#x27;{{Efn|This mixes Tatar front and back vowels; if using e as [æ], a more correct spelling would be kiçkine, which then leaves letter i as the e-sound.}}). Nowadays however the spelling has had more influence from Tatarstan .

<text>William II (1307 – 26 September 1345) was Count of Hainaut from 1337 until his death. He was also Count of Holland (as William IV) and Count of Zeeland. He succeeded his father, Count William I of Hainaut. While away fighting in Prussia, the Frisians revolted. William returned home and was killed at the Battle of Warns.

==Life==
William was born in 1307, the son of William I of Hainaut and Joan of Valois.&lt;br&gt; 

In 1334, he married Joanna, Duchess of Brabant, the daughter and heiress of John III, Duke of Brabant, but had no issue.&lt;br&gt; 

He fought in France as an ally of the English (he was the brother-in-law of King Edward III of England). In 1339, William participated in the Siege of Cambrai (1339). In 1345, two months before he died, he , because the bishop, John van Arkel, was trying to regain the bishopric&#x27;s historical independence from Holland. 

William fought against the Saracens, and went on crusade with the Teutonic Order in Prussia. He was killed near Stavoren, during one of the battles of Warns against the Frisians in 1345.

William was succeeded by his sister, Margaret of Hainaut, who was married to Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Hainaut, Holland and Zeeland became a part of the imperial crown domains.

<doc id="690984" wikidata="Q2706994" url="?curid=690984" title="Shortcake">
<text>Shortcake generally refers to a dessert with a crumbly scone-like texture. There are multiple variations of shortcake, most of which are served with fruit and cream. One of the most popular is strawberry shortcake, which is typically served with whipped cream. Other variations common in the UK are blackberry and clotted cream shortcake and lemon berry shortcake, which is served with lemon curd in place of cream.

==Preparation==
Shortcake is typically made with flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, salt, butter, milk or cream, and sometimes eggs. The dry ingredients are blended, and then the butter is cut in until the mixture resembles cornmeal. The liquid ingredients are then mixed in just until moistened, resulting in a shortened dough. The dough is then dropped in spoonfuls onto a baking sheet, rolled and cut like baking powder biscuits, or poured into a cake pan, depending on how wet the dough is and the baker&#x27;s preferences. Then it is baked at a relatively high temperature until set.

Strawberry shortcake is a widely known dessert made with shortcake. Sliced strawberries are mixed with sugar and allowed to sit an hour or so, until the strawberries have surrendered a great deal of their juices (macerated). The shortcakes are split, and the bottoms are covered with a layer of strawberries, juice, and whipped cream, typically flavored with sugar and vanilla. The top is replaced, and more strawberries and whipped cream are added onto the top. Some convenience versions of shortcake are not made with a shortcake (i.e. biscuit) at all, but instead use a base of sponge cake or sometimes a corn muffin.

Though strawberry is the most widely known shortcake dessert, peach shortcake, blueberry shortcake, chocolate shortcake and other similar desserts are made along similar lines. In some recipes the shortcake itself is flavored; coconut is one addition.

==History==
The &quot;short&quot; part of the name &quot;shortcake&quot; indicates something crumbly or crispy, generally through the addition of a fat such as butter or lard. The earliest printed mention of the descriptive term &quot;short&quot; – as in &quot;short cake&quot; – occurred in 1588, in the second English cookbook to be printed, &quot;The Good Huswifes Handmaid for Cookerie in her Kitchen&quot; (London, 1588). However, that recipe describes an unleavened cookie or biscuit (in the English sense), made of flour, cream, sugar, egg yolk and spices.

Strawberries were first included in a recipe for &quot;Strawberry cake&quot; which appeared in the June 1, 1845, issue (page 86) of &quot;The Ohio Cultivator&quot; (Columbus). The recipe was popularized by Eliza Leslie of Philadelphia in &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Receipt-book&quot; (1847). These &quot;Strawberry cakes&quot; were made of a thick unleavened cookie of flour, butter, eggs and sugar, split, layered with fresh strawberries, and covered with a hard sugar-and-egg white icing.

The North American introduction of baking soda and baking powder as leaven in the 1800s revolutionized baking and made possible the biscuit-style shortcake. By the 1850s, leavened shortcakes were the popular pastry for American strawberry cakes, and the term strawberry shortcake became established.

By the 1860s, cream was being poured onto the shortcake and strawberries. A June 1862 issue of the &quot;Genesse Farmer&quot; (Rochester) described a &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; made up of layers of soda biscuit, fresh berries, sugar, and cream. A similar recipe appeared in &quot;Jennie June&#x27;s American Cookery Book&quot; (1866) by Jane Cunningham Croly. The first known cookbook by a black woman in the United States, &quot;A Domestic Cook Book&quot; (1866) by Malinda Russell, also contains a recipe.

==Festivals==
In the United States, strawberry shortcake parties were held as celebrations of the summer fruit harvest. This tradition is upheld in some parts of the United States on June 14, which is Strawberry Shortcake Day.

The city of Lebanon, Oregon, holds the Strawberry Festival each year on the first full weekend of June. Since 1931, the festival has featured the &quot;Worlds Largest Strawberry Shortcake&quot;, which is transported by float during the Grand Parade and then served by the Strawberry Queen and her Court to festival visitors. The title of &quot;Worlds Largest&quot; is an honorary title. At approximately 5,700 lbs, the cake does not definitively hold the world record.

==Record==
The largest strawberry shortcake ever made was in the town of La Trinidad, Benguet, in the Philippines on March 20, 2004. It weighed 21,213.40 lbs (9622.23 kg).

<text>Wrexham Maelor () was a local government district with borough status, being one of six districts in the county of Clwyd, north-east Wales, from 1974 to 1996.

==History==
The borough was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered parts of four former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Maelor Rural District
*Marford and Hoseley parish from Hawarden Rural District
*Wrexham Municipal Borough
*Wrexham Rural District (except the parishes of Llangollen Rural and Llantysilio, which went to Glyndŵr)
The two Wrexham districts had been in the administrative county of Denbighshire prior to the reforms, whereas Maelor Rural District and the parish of Marford and Hoseley had both been exclaves of Flintshire, separated from the rest of the county by Denbighshire.

In 1996 the borough was abolished under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, which saw Clwyd County Council and its constituent districts abolished, being replaced by principal areas, whose councils perform the functions which had previously been divided between the county and district councils. The former Wrexham Maelor area all went to the new Wrexham County Borough, forming the bulk of the new borough.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. From 1974 until the council&#x27;s abolition in 1996, political control was held by the following parties:
==Premises==
The council was based at the Guildhall, which had been built in 1961 as the headquarters for the former Wrexham Borough Council. After Wrexham Maelor&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building became the headquarters for the new Wrexham County Borough Council.

<doc id="690993" wikidata="Q701977" url="?curid=690993" title="Alone in the Dark (2005 film)">
<text>Alone in the Dark is a 2005 action horror film directed by Uwe Boll and written by Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch, and Peter Scheerer. Based on the video game series of the same name, it stars Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff as paranormal investigators who combat a supernatural threat. The film&#x27;s story is a loose adaptation of the game &quot;Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare&quot; (2001).

Upon release, the film was poorly received by critics for the story, dialogue, special effects, and Reid&#x27;s performance. Holding a 1% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; is considered one of the worst films ever made. It was also a box-office bomb, grossing $12.7 million on a $20 million budget, although the home media releases were more successful. A sequel with a different cast and story was released to home media in 2008; Boll served as a producer.

==Plot==

Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator, has a nightmare in which he hides from alien-like creatures as a child. Carnby flies to an urban museum where his girlfriend, Aline Cedric, is an assistant curator. Carnby holds an artifact-puzzle piece of the Abkani, an extinct Native American tribe. A strange man follows Carnby and attacks him with supernatural strength, but the man dies after many escape attempts by Carnby. Simultaneously, a ship recovers a gold coffin from the ocean floor. After docking, the captain locks up the curator of the museum, Prof. Hudgens, while his crew opens the coffin. Hudgens escapes to find everyone killed by a mysterious creature and the coffin empty. Hudgens finds a secret compartment, collects an artifact from the coffin, and goes ashore.

Several people across the western US and Canada walk off into the night after hearing an ear-splitting screech, and Carnby passes out while studying his artifact. Bureau 713, where Carnby used to work, becomes aware of evidence of electromagnetic waves by a surveillance team. Carnby thinks it is related to the Abkani because everyone who disappeared was from the same location. Carnby arrives that evening at the museum with the artifact, and Cedric shows him another recently arrived Abkani artifact that she has been studying since Hudgens&#x27; absence. The mysterious creature from the ship attacks them inside the museum, killing a security guard. Carnby and Cedric hide in a storage closet until troopers from Bureau 713 arrive, and the creature retreats. Carnby attempts to relay information to their team leader, Commander Burke, but Burke tells him to stay out of it. Carnby asks his former co-workers, including staff surgeon and pathologist Sam Fischer, about the creature.

Hudgens returns to the museum with a captured creature. Hudgens uses a syringe to draw fluid from the creature to study it as part of his research in combining the DNA of man and beast. Carnby investigates his past by visiting his former orphanage to learn more about Hudgens&#x27; research.

While patrolling the museum, several creatures attack Bureau 713 soldiers. Several soldiers and most of the creatures, who are revealed to be people who disappeared earlier, are killed. Carnby arrives, and Burke again tells him to stay away. During a scuffle, Carnby picks Burke&#x27;s pocket containing his security badge. Carnby goes to Bureau 713 and talks with Fischer in the morgue while looking at one of the corpses. Fischer shows Carnby a small, centipede-like creature in the dorsal spine of his old friend. Fischer also discovers that Carnby has one of his own in his body, but it is dead, presumably because of the electroshock Carnby had as a child. Burke and his men arrive and escort Carnby out of the building. That evening, Professor Hudgens ambushes Fischer at his home and inserts a baby creature into Fischer&#x27;s mouth.

Carnby discovers that the Abkani had fought the creatures, which can be killed by light. They also disrupt electrical light, creating blackouts. The Abkani artifacts found all over the world open the gate to another dimension, where millions of creatures sleep, waiting to be freed. Hudgens further experiments, injecting himself with the blood of one of the creatures, which allows him to control the monsters. Carnby, Cedric, Burke, and Burke&#x27;s military squad go to an abandoned gold mine near Carnby&#x27;s orphanage, where there are strong electromagnetic disruptions. They are attacked by dozens of the creatures; only Carnby, Cedric, and Burke survive. They reach the underground surgery room where the baby creature was transplanted into Carnby. There, Hudgens takes Carnby&#x27;s artifact and opens the gate. Millions of creatures awaken and run towards the gate. Burke kills Hudgens. The group places a bomb and runs away, only to realize that they cannot detonate it remotely. Burke returns and sacrifices himself. Carnby and Cedric rise to the surface at dawn but find the city evacuated. As they walk down the street, something runs toward them.

==Cast==
* Christian Slater as Edward Carnby: Raised at an orphanage under Sister Clara, Carnby lost his memory when he was ten years old. At twenty, he was recruited by Bureau 713, gaining knowledge on the paranormal soon after. His current assignment is investigating his past along with researching the disappearance of the Abkani. Due to the experiments conducted on him as a child, he has the ability to sense paranormal activity and has increased strength and speed, which allow him to perform acrobatic moves that a normal human could not do.
** Dustyn Arthurs as Young Edward
* Tara Reid as Aline Cedrac, an archaeologist and museum curator; Edward&#x27;s girlfriend who knows about the Abkani and their culture.
* Stephen Dorff as Commander Richard Burke, the Commander of Bureau 713, formerly worked under Carnby&#x27;s direction.

* Ed Anders as James Pinkerton, a former Agent of Bureau 713 who went missing in action in the 1980s. He and Hudgens were in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of gold-miners at Brutan Goldmine. Pinkerton became an experiment for Hudgens, who attached a Xenos creature to his spine. His abilities included increased awareness, strength, speed and willpower.

==Production==
Blair Erickson came up with the first drafts of the script for &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;. According to Erickson, Uwe Boll suggested through various e-mails changes that would turn it from a thriller into an action film. Erickson stated his disgust at the treatment and spoke negatively of his working relationship with Boll on Something Awful:

As a result, there were seven distinct scripts in circulation without a consensus to which one was used.

Tara Reid starred in the film opposite Christian Slater. Artisan Pictures picked up North American distribution rights to the film in June 2003.

==Release==
&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; was released in Canada and the United States on January 28, 2005. It was released in Germany on February 3, 2005.

The film was released on VHS and DVD on 10 May 2005. An unrated director&#x27;s cut was released in Germany, France, and Australia and was #1 on the German DVD market for three weeks. It was released on DVD in North America on 25 September 2007. In the newest version of the film, the sex scene between Carnby and Aline has been removed.

==Original film and game tie-in concept==
Originally, the film version of &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; was to be released with &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (2008); however, the developers of the game, Eden Games, delayed and reworked it entirely from scratch. Boll stated his disappointment on the region 1 DVD commentary but also said that Atari had face shots of Christian Slater for &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;, which was released on June 26, 2008.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; grossed $2.8 million in its opening weekend, ranking at #12; by the end of its run, the film had grossed $12.7 million worldwide.

===Critical response===

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 1% of 119 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 2.2/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Inept on almost every level, &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; may not work as a thriller, but it&#x27;s good for some head-slapping, incredulous laughter&quot;. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 9 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a rare F grade.

Scott Brown of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an F grade, commenting that the film was &quot;so bad it&#x27;s postmodern&quot;. In the film&#x27;s only positive review listed by Rotten Tomatoes, Michelle Alexandria of Eclipse Magazine wrote: &quot;&quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; isn&#x27;t going to set the world on fire, but it largely succeeds with what it has to work with. Just don&#x27;t take it seriously and you&#x27;ll have a fun time&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==

The 2-disc soundtrack was released by Nuclear Blast, with Wolfgang Herold as executive producer. The German band Agathodaimon&#x27;s contribution was the title song. Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish had a music video of &quot;Wish I Had an Angel&quot; directed by Uwe Boll, with clips from the film.

<text>Jacqueline (; ; ; 15 July 1401 – 8 October 1436), of the House of Wittelsbach, was a noblewoman who ruled the counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut in the Low Countries from 1417 to 1433. She was also Dauphine of France for a short time between 1415 and 1417 and Duchess of Gloucester in the 1420s, if her marriage to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, is accepted as valid.

Jacqueline was born in Le Quesnoy and from her birth she was referred to as &quot;of Holland&quot;, indicating that she was the heiress of her father&#x27;s estates.

Jacqueline was the last Wittelsbach ruler of Hainaut and Holland. Following her death, her estates passed into the inheritance of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.

==Life==

===Early life and marriage to John, Duke of Touraine===

She was the only daughter of William II, Duke of Bavaria (also known as William VI, Count of Holland) from his marriage with Margaret, a daughter of Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy and Margaret III, Countess of Flanders.

At the age of 22 months (in Paris on 5 May 1403) and again at the age of four (in Compiègne on 29 June 1406), Jacqueline was betrothed to John, Duke of Touraine, fourth son of King Charles VI of France and Queen Isabeau of Bavaria. Both children were brought up in the Castle of Le Quesnoy in Hainaut. The boy had been given into tutelage of his future father-in-law, since he was expected to succeed as ruler in Hainaut and not in any way in France itself. On 22 April 1411 the Pope gave his dispensation for the union and on 6 August 1415, when Jacqueline was fourteen, she and John married in The Hague. With this marriage, Duke William II wanted to secure the succession of his daughter to his domains; although he had at least nine illegitimate children, Jacqueline was his only legitimate offspring and as a female, her rights would be contested by her paternal uncle Bishop John of Liège and her cousin Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy since 1419.

Four months after the wedding, on 15 December 1415, John&#x27;s elder brother Louis, Dauphin of France, died; and thus John became the heir to the throne, with Jacqueline as the Dauphine and future Queen consort. Duke William II, who had raised John since childhood, as the father-in-law of the future King obtained a considerable influence at the French court; however, despite this he was less successful in his efforts with the German King Sigismund of Luxembourg to recognize Jacqueline as his rightful heir in the Counties of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut. In March 1416, Count William raised the matter with Sigismund while the latter was the guest of the English king, Henry V of England, but was rejected; he angrily returned home.

Dauphin John died (probably poisoned) on 4 April 1417, leaving Jacqueline as a widow aged 16. Two months later on 31 May, she unexpectedly lost her father. Duke William II was bitten by a dog, which caused a blood infection that quickly killed him. The politically inexperienced Jacqueline now had to fight for her inheritance.

===Marriage to John IV, Duke of Brabant and war with John III===

In Hainaut, where female succession was long customary, Jacqueline was recognized as countess on 13 June, but in Holland and Zeeland her rights were controversial from the beginning. While the old aristocracy supported her, the municipal party supported her uncle John III, the youngest brother of her father and since 1389 the elected Bishop of Liège, although he was never fully ordained. Even before William II&#x27;s death, he had expected to become his successor, and therefore he gave up his diocese. On the advice of her mother, Jacqueline initially gave her uncle the title of Guardian and Defender of the County of Hainaut (&quot;Hüters und Verteidigers des Landes Hennegau&quot;) in order to forestall his ambitions. However, the German King Sigismund, who had already been against Jacqueline&#x27;s rights since 1416, formally enfeoffed John III with the counties of his deceased brother and married him to his niece Elisabeth of Görlitz, Duchess of Luxembourg and widow of Anthony, Duke of Brabant, who died in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.

Jacqueline also remarried, but her selection of husband was unfortunate. John IV, Duke of Brabant, stepson of Elisabeth of Görlitz, who succeeded his father Anthony as Duke of Brabant, was chosen to be her second husband; modern historians believed that this decision was widely influenced by Jacqueline&#x27;s mother and uncle John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. On 31 July 1417, two months after William II&#x27;s death, the betrothal between Jacqueline and John IV took place, and the wedding was celebrated in The Hague on 10 March 1418. However, the union proved to be a failure. The close relationship between the spouses required a papal dispensation, which, although granted in December 1417, was revoked in January 1418 in the Council of Constance due to the intrigues of Jacqueline&#x27;s opponents, including King Sigismund of Luxembourg. In addition to this, the considerable financial problems of the young Duke John IV and his weak political leadership increased the conflicts inside the marriage.
John III, with the support of King Sigismund and the Cods, took up arms against Jacqueline, who was supported by the Hooks; this civil war was known as the &quot;Hook and Cod wars&quot;. The troops of uncle and niece met in the Battle of Gorkum in 1417; Jacqueline was victorious, but was forced to leave the major trading city of Dordrecht. In addition, her marital status was again questioned thanks to her uncle, who claimed that without papal dispensation the union was annulled; this caused even more misgivings for Jacqueline about how to maintain her marriage. Even worse, on 29 May 1418 and against the express wishes of King Sigismund, John IV pledged the district of Mons; because of this Jacqueline in 1419 signed the Compensation of Workum (&quot;Ausgleich von Workum&quot;) with her cousin Philip the Good, future Duke of Burgundy, under which for a monetary compensation she ceded to him the districts of Dordrecht, Gorkum and Rotterdam.

John III agreed to recognize the legitimacy of the marriage between Jacqueline and John IV of Brabant if only to receive a high financial compensation from the government for the next five years of the regions dominated by the spouses. However, the intervention of Pope Martin V finally ended the controversy with granting the papal dispensation on May 1419. John IV, always heavily indebted and against the will of his wife signed with John III the Treaty of St. Martinsdyk, under which he gave to Jacqueline&#x27;s uncle full custody over Holland and Zeeland for the next 12 years. In exchange, John III gave a monetary compensation to the couple and left them the County of Hainaut; however, this was a little consolation for Jacqueline, whose subjects of Holland, Zeeland and Friesland were released from their oath of allegiance under the terms of the treaty. Finally, John IV also pledged Hainaut to improve his financial situation; for Jacqueline, this was enough: she and her allies began to want the formal separation from John IV.

===Marriage to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester and aftermath===

In the meanwhile, the political situation had changed radically. The Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, was assassinated in September 1419, and the French Dauphin Charles, brother of Jacqueline&#x27;s first husband, was considered an accomplice and was therefore disinherited in 1420 under the Treaty of Troyes. King Henry V of England then claimed to be the King of France. In February 1421 Jacqueline issued a statement where she stated that, because of the destructive behaviour of John IV of Brabant, she wanted the annulment of her marriage. The fight against John III, continued until the capture of the city of Leiden, the last city loyal to Jacqueline; after this, she had to admit defeat.

On 6 March 1421 Jacqueline fled to England asking the help of Henry V, who gave her a glamorous reception. She was an honoured guest at the court of England, and when the future Henry VI was born, Jacqueline was made one of his godparents.
It was only after the unexpected death of Henry V in 1422 that Jacqueline obtained a dubious divorce from John IV of Brabant valid only in England that allowed her third marriage with Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, Henry V&#x27;s brother and principal counsellor of the Kingdom on behalf of his infant nephew Henry VI. However, as not all rules were observed, the marriage was arranged in haste and in secret in the town of Hadleigh, Essex, sometime between February and 7 March 1423.

The news of this marriage shocked everyone. On 15 October 1423 it was announced that not only was Jacqueline married to one of the most powerful princes of Europe, but that she was also rumoured to be pregnant with his child. On 20 October, she was granted a letter of denization, which would allow her and her descendants to be treated as English under law, and it recorded her status as duchess of Gloucester. To secure her position, Jacqueline had to obtain the formal annulment of her marriage with John IV of Brabant. She asked Pope Martin V in Rome and Antipope Benedict XIII in Avignon to resolve her irregular marital status, but her uncle John III intervened against it. Unexpectedly, her cousin Philip the Good, who wanted to prevent an English invasion, supported the annulment.

In the autumn of 1424 Jacqueline joined Humphrey in the Duchy of Gloucester, where she had a stillborn child; this was her only recorded pregnancy.

Jacqueline and Humphrey landed in Calais and by the end of November they entered Mons, where on 5 December the Duke of Gloucester was recognized as the sovereign Count of Hainaut. Already on 3 January 1425 he signed with

::&quot;Humphrey, by the grace of God, son, brother and uncle of kings, Duke of Gloucester, Count of Hainaut, Holland, Zealand and Pembroke, Lord of Friesland and Grand Chamberlain of England&quot;.

===War in Holland===

Her situation changed when her uncle John III of Bavaria died on 6 January 1425, the victim of poisoning. John IV, Duke of Brabant, still claimed rights over Holland, Zeeland and Hainault and made Philip, Duke of Burgundy, regent of Holland and Zeeland, like he had done before with John III.
Jacqueline escaped her imprisonment in Ghent disguised in men&#x27;s clothing and fled to Schoonhoven and then Gouda, where she stayed with the leaders of the Hook faction. Now it was her former husband, John of Brabant, who tried to dispute her inheritance. In this matter, Humphrey did intervene, albeit with limited force; his efforts, however, had disastrous consequences for the English-Burgundian alliance that aided the English cause in France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Pope Martin V decreed that Jacqueline was still the wife of John IV, Duke of Brabant, and therefore her marriage to Humphrey of Gloucester was illegitimate. However, John IV had died a year earlier.

===Peace and loss of lands===

On 3 July 1428 Jacqueline had to agree to a peace treaty, Reconciliation of Delft (&quot;de Zoen van Delft&quot;), with the duke of Burgundy. By this treaty, Jacqueline kept her titles of Countess of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut, but the administration of her territories was placed in the hands of Philip, who was also appointed as her heir in case she died without children. She was not allowed to marry without the permission of her mother, Philip and the three counties. (Her marriage to Humphrey was annulled in this same year.)
However, her financial situation was dire. She barely had enough income to support her household. Furthermore, the duke of Burgundy did not stop after the peace treaty in 1428. He bought the loyalty of her allies or estranged them from her in another way. At Easter 1433, Jacqueline &quot;voluntarily&quot; signed a treaty with Philip which gave Philip all her lands and titles. In return she was allowed the income of several estates, mostly situated in Zeeland.

===Marriage with Frank van Borssele and death===

With the renunciation of her titles, Jacqueline retired to her land in Zeeland. There, she and Francis, Lord of Borssele (&quot;Frank van Borssele&quot;), a local and powerful nobleman, became close. In the spring of 1434 they married and Philip granted Frank the title of Count of Oostervant. This marriage, contrary to the other three, was one out of love, at least for Jacqueline. It did not last long. In 1436 she became ill and after a few months of illness she died of tuberculosis in Teylingen Castle on 8 October 1436. Since she had no children, Philip of Burgundy inherited Hainaut and Holland. Her husband Frank survived her for thirty-four years.

==Legends==

There are many legends surrounding the life of Jacqueline. The most prevalent one is her supposed secret marriage to Francis of Borssele in 1432, two years prior to their public and official wedding. This secret marriage was supposed to be the real reason why she had to give up her titles and give them to the duke of Burgundy as it would violate the regulations in the peace treaty of 1428. However, there is no evidence that such a secret marriage ever took place and contemporary sources only mention the rumours of an upcoming wedding between Jacqueline and Francis at the end of 1433, half a year after Jacqueline renounced her titles.

==Popular culture==
She is the central protagonist of the 1831 novel &quot;Jacqueline of Holland&quot; by the Irish writer Thomas Colley Grattan.

<text>Jerrold Lewis Bock (November 23, 1928November 3, 2010) was an American musical theater composer. He received the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama with Sheldon Harnick for their 1959 musical &quot;Fiorello!&quot; and the Tony Award for Best Composer and Lyricist for the 1964 musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; with Sheldon Harnick.

==Biography==
Born into a Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut, and raised in Flushing, Queens, New York, Bock studied the piano as a child. While a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, he wrote the musical &quot;Big As Life&quot;, which toured the state and enjoyed a run in Chicago. After graduation, he spent three summers at the Tamiment Playhouse in the Poconos and wrote for early television revues with lyricist Larry Holofcener. One of their songs, the three-part &quot;The Story of Alice,&quot; was performed by the Chad Mitchell Trio on their &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; album of 1962.

===Career===
Bock made his Broadway debut in 1955 when he and Lawrence Holofcener contributed songs to &quot;Catch a Star&quot;. The following year the duo collaborated on the musical &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot;, designed for Sammy Davis Jr., after which they worked on &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1956&quot;, which closed out-of-town.

Shortly after, Bock met lyricist Sheldon Harnick, with whom he forged a successful partnership. Although their first joint venture, &quot;The Body Beautiful&quot;, failed to charm the critics, its score caught the attention of director George Abbott and producer Hal Prince. They hired the team to compose a musical biography of former New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia. &quot;Fiorello!&quot; (1959) earned Bock and Harnick the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Musical, Tony Award for Best Musical (tied with the team from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;) and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

Bock&#x27;s additional collaborations with Harnick include &quot;Tenderloin&quot; (1960), &quot;Man in the Moon&quot; (1963), &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (1963), &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1964), &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Rothschilds&quot; (1970), as well as contributions to &quot;Never Too Late&quot; (1962), &quot;Baker Street&quot; (1965), &quot;Her First Roman&quot; (1968), and &quot;The Madwoman of Central Park West&quot; (1979). &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; included the hit song &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot;.

Established in 1997, the Jerry Bock Award for Excellence in Musical Theater is an annual grant presented to the composer and lyricist of a project developed in the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop.

Bock spoke at the funeral of 98-year-old Fiddler playwright Joseph Stein just 10 days before his own death, from heart failure at 81, less than three weeks before his 82nd birthday.

<text>Aldtsjerk () is a village on the main road from Leeuwarden to Dokkum. It is part of Tytsjerksteradiel municipality, Friesland, the Netherlands and had around 615 inhabitants as of January 2018. 

Its annual festivities include the &quot;Doarpsfeest&quot;, including a parade, held in the summer.
Local landmarks include the &quot;Heemstra State&quot;, former residence of the aristocratic Sminia family. The village&#x27;s main road, the &quot;van Sminiaweg&quot; is about 1.5 km long and named after the Sminia family.
The village also houses a former baker who was quite famous for his &quot;Oranjekoek&quot; and &quot;Suikerbrood&quot;, but who retired in 2000 when the euro was introduced.
Local shopping facilities are scarce: the nearest grocery market is located in Oentsjerk, about three kilometers outside town limits. The most notable shop of the town is a bike dealership and a store called &quot;Bram en Jannie&#x27;s&quot;, which stands not actually in the village itself, but halfway between Aldtjserk and Oentsjerk.
In the center of the village is located the Aldtsjerk church, which was built in 12th century and gives the village its name (&quot;Old Church&quot;). 

Near the village is the &quot;Aldtsjerkster mar&quot;, a small lake which is an important point on the Elfstedentocht.
In Dutch, the village is called Oudkerk (&quot;Old Church&quot;); Aldtsjerk is its West Frisian name. It was one of the first Frisian towns to be generally listed under its West Frisian, rather than its Dutch name. The Ouderkerkermolen is a preserved windmill in Aldtsjerk.

<doc id="691019" wikidata="Q349973" url="?curid=691019" title="Shuangyashan">
<text>Shuangyashan () is a coal mining prefecture-level city located in the eastern part Heilongjiang province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, bordering Russia&#x27;s Khabarovsk and Primorsky Krais to the east. The city&#x27;s name means a pair-of-ducks mountains and refers to two peaks northeast of the city. In 2007 the city had a GDP of RMB 20.6 billion with a 14.2% growth rate.

==Administrative divisions==
==History==
Shuangyashan was given its name in AD 1384 during the Ming Dynasty. However, few people lived in the area before coal was discovered there in 1914. In 1928 a major coal mining operation was established on the site and in 1946 the area was first designated a county. Shuangyashan was established as a special mining district in 1954 and officially designated a city by the CPC Central Committee and State Council in 1956.

==Geography and climate==

===Resources===
Shuangyashan is rich in coal, magnetite and marble. The proven coal reserves in the city total 11 billion tons, ranking first out of 13 prefecture and prefecture-level cities in the province. The magnetite reserves in Shuangyashan exceed 120 million tons, ranking first in Heilongjiang Province.

===Climate===
The city has a cold temperate monsoon climate, with long, cold, windy winters. The annual mean temperature in the city is .

==Economy==
Shuangyashan is a major center for coal mining. The city also produces steel, lumber, chemicals, building materials, textiles, electric machinery, and food products. In 2010, Shuangyashan&#x27;s GDP reached RMB 37.67 billion, featuring a growth of 25% from a year ago. The production output of steel and coal ranked the first and the second in Heilongjiang province. The region has attracted investments from large domestic companies such as Shandong Luneng Group and Jianlong Group. Tourism, retailing and wholesaling are also the pillars of the city&#x27;s service sector.

More recently, the city has been feeling the effects of the coal downturn, with mining demand collapsing amidst a slowdown in China&#x27;s economic growth.

<doc id="691024" wikidata="Q378628" url="?curid=691024" title="England national rugby union team">
<text>The England national rugby union team represents the Rugby Football Union in men&#x27;s international rugby union. They compete in the annual Six Nations Championship with France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. England have won the championship on 29 occasions (as well as sharing 10 victories), winning the Grand Slam 14 times and the Triple Crown 26 times, making them the most successful outright winners in the tournament&#x27;s history. They are currently the only team from the Northern Hemisphere to win the Rugby World Cup, having won the tournament in 2003, and have been runners-up on three further occasions.

The history of the team extends back to 1871 when the English rugby team played their first official test match, losing 0–1 to Scotland. England dominated the early Home Nations Championship (now the Six Nations) which started in 1883. Following the schism of rugby football in 1895 into union and league, England did not win the Championship again until 1910. They first played against New Zealand in 1905, South Africa in 1906, and Australia in 1909. England was one of the teams invited to take part in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987. They progressed to the final in the second tournament in 1991, but lost to the eventual champions Australia. Following their Grand Slam in 2003, England went on to win the 2003 Rugby World Cup, defeating Australia (20–17) in extra time. They contested the final again in 2007 in defence of their title but lost (6–15) to South Africa. They reached the final for the fourth time in 2019, but lost (12–32) to South Africa.

England players traditionally wear a white shirt with a rose embroidered on the chest, white shorts, and navy blue socks with a white trim. England&#x27;s home ground is Twickenham Stadium where they first played in 1910. The team is administered by the Rugby Football Union (RFU). Five former players have been inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. One of them is also a member of the IRB Hall of Fame. Seven other former players are members of the IRB Hall, four solely for their accomplishments as players, two solely for their achievements in other roles in the sport, and one for achievements both as a player and administrator. They have been branched in many different squads since the start of England Rugby, such as Junior teams and Women&#x27;s teams.

== History ==

=== Early years ===

The expansion of rugby in the first half of the 19th century was driven by former pupils from many of England&#x27;s public schools, especially Rugby, who, upon finishing school, took the game with them to universities, to London, and to the counties. England&#x27;s first international match was against Scotland on 27 March 1871; not only was this England&#x27;s first match, but it is also noted as being the first rugby union international. Scotland won the match by one goal and a try to England&#x27;s one unconverted try, in front of a crowd of 4,000 people at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. A subsequent international took place at the Oval in London on 5 February 1872, when England defeated Scotland by a goal, a drop goal and two tries to Scotland&#x27;s one drop goal. The early matches did not use a structured points system; this would not be introduced until after 1890 when a suitable format for the scoring system had been devised. Up until 1875, international rugby matches were decided by the number of goals scored (conversions and dropped goals), but from 1876 the number of tries scored could be used to decide a match if the teams were level on goals.

In 1875, England played their first game against Ireland at the Oval, winning by one goal, one drop goal and one try to nil; this was Ireland&#x27;s first test match. England defeated Scotland in 1880 to become the first winners of the Calcutta Cup. Their first match against Wales was played on 19 February 1881 at Richardson&#x27;s Field in Blackheath, where England recorded their largest victory, winning by seven goals, six tries, and one drop goal to nil, and scoring 13 tries in the process. The subsequent meeting the following year at St. Helen&#x27;s in Swansea was a closer contest, with England defeating Wales by two goals and four tries to nil. Two years later, England emerged as the inaugural winners at the first Home Nations championship. In 1889, they played their first match against a non-home nations team when they defeated the New Zealand Natives at Rectory Field in Blackheath by one goal and four tries to nil. England shared the Home Nations trophy with Scotland in 1890.

England first played New Zealand (known as the &quot;All Blacks&quot;) in 1905 at Crystal Palace in London. New Zealand scored five tries, worth three points at the time, to win 15–0. England played France for the first time in March 1906 in Paris, winning 35–8, and later that year they first faced South Africa (known as the &quot;Springboks&quot;), again at Crystal Palace. James Peters was withdrawn from the England squad when the South Africans refused to play against a black player; the match was drawn 3–3. England first played Australia (known as the &quot;Wallabies&quot;) in January 1909 at Blackheath&#x27;s Rectory Field, where they were defeated 9–3.
The year 1909 saw the opening of Twickenham Stadium as the RFU&#x27;s new home, heralding a golden era for English rugby union. England&#x27;s first international at Twickenham in 1910 brought them victory over Wales on their way to winning the International Championship (known from then as the Five Nations) for the first time since 1892. Although England did not retain the Five Nations title in 1911, they did share it (with Ireland) in 1912. England then achieved their first Five Nations Grand Slam in 1913, another in 1914, and a third in 1921 after the First World War. A further two consecutive Grand Slams followed for the England team in 1924 and 1925, this despite having started 1925 with an 17–11 loss to the &quot;Invincibles&quot; in front of 60,000 fans at Twickenham.

After winning a sixth Grand Slam in 1928, England were subjected to a 7–0 defeat by the Springboks in front of 70,000 spectators at Twickenham in January 1932. Following the expulsion of France from the International Championship in 1931 due to professionalism, which reverted the Five Nations tournament back to the Home Nations, England proceeded to win the 1934 and 1937 championships with a Triple Crown, and achieved their first victory over the All Blacks at Twickenham in January 1936.

When the Five Nations resumed with the readmission of France in 1947 after the Second World War, England shared the championship with Wales. The early Five Nations competitions of the 1950s were unsuccessful for England, winning one match in the 1950 and 1951 championships. England won the 1953 Five Nations, and followed this up with a Grand Slam in 1957, and win in 1958. England broke France&#x27;s four-championship streak by winning the 1963 Championship. After this victory, England played three Tests in the Southern Hemisphere and lost all three: 21–11 and 9–6 against the All Blacks, and 18–9 against Australia. England did not win a single match in 1966, and managed only a draw with Ireland. They did not win another Championship that decade.

Don White was appointed as England&#x27;s first coach in 1969. According to former Northampton player Bob Taylor, &quot;Don was chosen because he was the most forward-thinking coach in England&quot;. His first match in charge was an 11–8 victory over South Africa at Twickenham in 1969. Of the eleven games England played with White in charge they won three, and drew one and lost seven. He resigned as England coach in 1971.

England had wins against Southern Hemisphere teams in the 1970s; with victories over South Africa in 1972, New Zealand in 1973 and Australia in 1973 and 1976. The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland. England played in Dublin in 1973 and were given a standing ovation lasting five minutes. After losing 18–9 at Lansdowne Road, the England captain, John Pullin famously stated, &quot;We might not be very good but at least we turned up.&quot;

England started the following decade with a Grand Slam victory in the 1980 Five Nations – their first for 23 years. However in the 1983 Five Nations Championship, England failed to win a game and picked up the wooden spoon. In the first Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, England were grouped in pool A alongside Australia, Japan and the United States. England lost their first game 19–6 against Australia. They went on to defeat Japan and the United States, and met Wales in their quarter-final, losing the match 16–3.

In 1989, England won matches against Romania and Fiji, followed by victories in their first three Five Nations games of 1990. They lost to Scotland in their last game however, giving Scotland a Grand Slam. England recovered in the following year by winning their first Grand Slam since 1980. England hosted the 1991 World Cup and were in pool A, along with the All Blacks, Italy and the United States. Although they lost to the All Blacks in pool play, they qualified for a quarter-final going on to defeat France 19–10. England then defeated Scotland 9–6 to secure a place in the final against Australia which they lost 12–6.

The next year, England completed another Grand Slam and did not lose that year, including a victory over the Springboks. In the lead up to the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, England completed another Grand Slam – their third in five years. In the World Cup, England defeated Argentina, Italy and Samoa in pool play and then defeated Australia 25–22 in their quarter-final. England&#x27;s semi-final was dominated by the All Blacks and featured four tries, now worth five points each, by Jonah Lomu; England lost 45–29. They then lost the third-place play-off match against France.

=== Professional Era ===
England won their 20th Triple Crown title in 1997, but came second in the 1997 Five Nations Championship after a narrow (20–23) defeat to France at Twickenham. Sir Clive Woodward replaced Jack Rowell as the England head coach later that year. On 6 December 1997, England drew (26–26) with New Zealand at Twickenham, after being heavily defeated (11–29) by South Africa at the same venue the week before and by New Zealand (8–25) in Manchester two weeks previously. In 1998, England toured Australia, New Zealand and South Africa; many of the experienced players were unavailable for what was to become nicknamed the &quot;Tour from Hell&quot; during which England lost all of their matches including a punishing (0–76) defeat by the Wallabies. In the last Five Nations match on 11 April 1999, with England poised to win the championship, Welsh centre Scott Gibbs sliced through six English tackles to score a try in the last minute, and the ensuing conversion by Neil Jenkins handed the final Five Nations title to Scotland.
England commenced the new millennium by winning the inaugural Six Nations Championship, although they lost their last match to Scotland. They successfully defended their title the following year, but missed out on the Grand Slam by losing (14–20) to Ireland in a postponed match at Lansdowne Road. Although France won the 2002 Six Nations Championship, England defeated the other Home Nations teams to win the Triple Crown. In 2002, England beat Argentina (26–18) in Buenos Aires, and in the Autumn internationals they defeated New Zealand (31–28), Australia (32–31), and South Africa (53–3) at Twickenham. At the 2003 Six Nations Championship, England won the Grand Slam for the first time since 1995, followed by wins over Australia and the All Blacks on their June summer tour.

Going into the 2003 World Cup as one of the tournament favourites, England reached the final on 22 November 2003 against host Australia. The game went into extra time with the score tied at (14–14), after one penalty apiece and with just seconds to spare, a match-winning drop goal by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson brought the final score to (20–17), making England rugby world champions for the first time. Not only was this England&#x27;s first Rugby World Cup victory, but it was the nation&#x27;s first world cup since the England national football team won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. On 8 December, the England team were greeted by 750,000 supporters on a victory parade through London before meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.
England finished third in the 2004 Six Nations Championship after losing their matches to both France and Ireland. Clive Woodward resigned as head coach on 2 September and Andy Robinson was appointed to replace him. Robinson&#x27;s first Six Nations campaign in 2005 resulted in fourth place for England, and although they defeated Australia (26–16) at Twickenham in the Autumn internationals, this was followed by a (19–23) loss to the All Blacks.

A (14–25) loss to South Africa in the 2006 Autumn internationals was England&#x27;s eighth defeat in nine test matches, their worst losing streak. Andy Robinson resigned as head coach after this run, and attack coach Brian Ashton was appointed as his replacement in December. England started the 2007 Six Nations Championship with a Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland. That year&#x27;s championship included a historic match at Croke Park which England lost (13–43), their heaviest defeat against Ireland.

At the 2007 World Cup, England were grouped in Pool A with Samoa, Tonga, South Africa, and the United States. They progressed to the knockout stage despite a heavy (0–36) loss to South Africa, and narrowly defeated Australia (12–10) in the quarter-finals. England then faced hosts France in the semi-finals and triumphed (14–9) to qualify for the final, where they were subjected to a second defeat by the Springboks at this World Cup, losing the match (6–15). England followed up their World Cup disappointment with two consecutive second-place finishes in the Six Nations Championship, behind Wales (2008) and Ireland (2009). Former England team captain Martin Johnson took up the job of head coach in July 2008 but, unable to replicate his on-field success in the management role, he resigned in November 2011 following a miserable Rugby World Cup which featured a series of on- and off-field controversies and ended in quarter-final defeat by France.

In March 2012, the Rugby Football Union appointed Stuart Lancaster, the former Elite Rugby Director at Leeds Carnegie, as England&#x27;s head coach. He had previously been employed in the position on a short-term basis, assisted by existing forwards coach Graham Rowntree, and Andy Farrell. Lancaster was considered a success in his first campaign as head coach: defending champions England took second place in the 2012 Six Nations Championship after losing (12–19) to Wales at Twickenham, but successfully defended the Calcutta Cup by defeating Scotland (13–6) at Murrayfield. England finished the year on a high when they beat World Cup holders New Zealand (38–21) at Twickenham in the Autumn internationals; the England team dominated the match and completely outplayed the All Blacks, who had been unbeaten in 20 matches.

At the 2013 Six Nations Championship, England again finished in second place behind Wales, and were deprived of the opportunity to win the Grand Slam for the first time since 2003 when they were defeated by Wales in Cardiff (3–30). It was the first time since 1974 that every team in the Six Nations managed to win at least three competition points (the equivalent of a win and a draw, or three draws). However, England retained the Calcutta Cup by defeating Scotland (38–18) at Twickenham. Lancaster took an experimental side on a summer tour of Argentina in 2013; after beating a South American select XV on 2 June, England achieved a (2–0) series victory over Argentina, their first away series win against &quot;the Pumas&quot; for 32 years.

In 2015, England hosted the Rugby World Cup, but were eliminated in the pool stage. Despite this setback, and following the appointment of new head coach Eddie Jones, England won the Grand Slam in the 2016 Six Nations Championship, and remained unbeaten for the whole of 2016, including a series whitewash of Australia in Sydney. They went on to equal the world record of 18 consecutive test wins with an impressive (61–21) victory over Scotland in securing the 2017 Six Nations Championship.

2018 began well for England, seeing off a spirited challenge from Italy (46–15), and winning a tight contest against Wales (12–6) in the first two rounds of the Six Nations. However, it wasn&#x27;t until June before England recorded another win, as the team lost their remaining games against Scotland (13–25), France (16–22) and eventual Grand Slam winners Ireland (15–24) at home in Twickenham. A non-test loss against the Barbarians (45–63) followed.

On their summer tour of South Africa, England lost the first two matches (39–42) and (12–23), despite having the lead early in the first half, before winning the third test (25–10) against a mostly second-string Springbok side. That autumn, after adding former New Zealand and United States coach John Mitchell to the coaching setup, England won the return match against South Africa by a single point (12–11), and lost an equally close contest with New Zealand (15–16), both in controversial circumstances. England rounded out the year with wins over Japan (35–15) and Australia (37–18). The win over Australia continued an unbroken run of victories over the Wallabies under former Australia coach Eddie Jones.

England finished second in the 2019 Six Nations Championship. They beat Ireland (32–20), France (44–8), Italy (57–14) but lost to Wales (13–21) and drew (38–38) with Scotland after leading (31–0). In the 2019 Rugby World Cup warm-up matches they defeated Wales (33–19) at Twickenham before losing (6–13) in Cardiff. They then recorded their largest win over Ireland with a (57–15) victory at Twickenham before defeating Italy (37–0) at St James&#x27; Park. In the 2019 Rugby World Cup, England became the first team to qualify for the quarter-finals following a (39–10) win over Argentina in Chōfu. After their final match was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, England topped Pool C and faced Australia in the quarter-finals. England won the quarter-final (40–16), recording a 7th consecutive victory over Australia which resulted in the Wallabies largest ever Rugby World Cup defeat. England then defeated New Zealand in the semi-final, equalling New Zealands largest Rugby World Cup defeat with a (19–7) victory in which the All Blacks were kept scoreless for 57 minutes. On 2 November 2019, England were defeated (12–32) by South Africa in the 2019 Rugby World Cup final.

In the 2020 Six Nations Championship, England were defeated (17–24) in their opening game against France in Paris before recording victories against Scotland at Murrayfield and Ireland and Wales at Twickenham. The tournament was then halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resumed with the matches played in empty stadiums in October. In the postponed matches, England recorded a bonus point win over Italy in Rome before France defeated Ireland by eight points which meant that England won the championship on points difference. Due to the pandemic, the scheduled 2020 Autumn Internationals were replaced by the Autumn Nations Cup. England defeated Georgia, Wales and Ireland before facing France in the final match, winning (22–19) after extra time at Twickenham to secure the tournament.

England finished fifth in the 2021 Six Nations Championship, beating France and Italy but losing to all three home nations for the first time since 1976 and conceding defeat to Scotland at Twickenham for the first time since 1983. In the 2021 Autumn Internationals, England played three matches at Twickenham. They secured a (69–3) victory over Tonga, recorded their 8th consecutive victory over Australia (32–15) and also beat the current World Champions South Africa (27–26).

England finished third in the 2022 Six Nations Championship after defeating Italy (33–0) and Wales (23–19) but lost Ireland (15–32), France (13–25), and Scotland (17–20). In the 2022 English tour of Australia, England faced the Wallabies in a 3 test series. They lost the first test match in Perth (28–30), but won the last two test matches (25–17) in Brisbane, and (21–17) in Sydney to win the test series 2–1. In the 2022 Autumn Internationals they lost to Argentina (29–30), beat Japan (52–13), drew with New Zealand (25–25), and lost to South Africa (13–27).

England finished fourth in the 2023 Six Nations Championship. England defeated Italy (31–14) and Wales (20–10) but was beaten by Scotland (23–29), France (10–53) and Ireland (16–29). At the 2023 Rugby World Cup, England beat Argentina (27–10), Japan (34–12), Chile (71–0), and Samoa (18–17) to go undefeated in the pool stages. In the quarter-final, they defeated Fiji (30–24) before losing to the eventual champions South Africa (15–16) in the semi-final. They ended their campaign with a win over Argentina (26–23) in the bronze final to finish the tournament in 3rd place. 

England finished third in the 2024 Six Nations Championship. They defeated Italy (27–24), Wales (16–14), Ireland (23–22), but lost to Scotland (21–30) and France (31–33). In the 2024 English tour of New Zealand, England faced the All Blacks in a 2 test series. They were defeated in both test matches (15–16) in Dunedin and (17–24) in Auckland. In the 2024 Autumn Internationals, England lost to New Zealand (22–24), Australia (37–42), South Africa (20–29), but won (59—14) against Japan. 
== Home stadium ==

Twickenham is the largest dedicated rugby stadium in the world. In the early years, the English rugby team used a number of venues in several different locations around England before settling at Twickenham Stadium in 1910. After sell-out matches at Crystal Palace against New Zealand in 1905 and South Africa in 1906, the Rugby Football Union (RFU) decided to invest in their own ground and arranged for sportsman and entrepreneur Billy Williams to find a home ground for English Rugby. The land for the ground was purchased in 1907 for £5,572 12s and 6d, and construction began the following year.

The first international test match at Twickenham took place on the 15th of January 1910 between England and Wales. The home team won (11–6), beating Wales for the first time since 1898. The stadium was expanded in 1927 and again in 1932, but there were no further upgrades until 1981 when a new South stand was built and the 1990s when new North, East and West stands were built; the South stand was replaced in 2005 and 2006 to make the stadium into a complete bowl. England played their first test match at the redeveloped Twickenham on the 5th of November 2006 against the All Blacks, losing the test match (20–41), in front of a record crowd of 82,076.

The pitch at Twickenham was replaced in June 2012 with a hybrid &#x27;Desso&#x27; type, which uses artificial fibres entwined with real grass. This type of pitch surface is particularly hard wearing in wet conditions.

=== England home matches outside Twickenham ===
Although England have played home matches almost exclusively at Twickenham since 1910, they have occasionally used alternative English venues. England home matches have been hosted at Leicester&#x27;s Welford Road (1923), London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium (1992), Old Trafford (1997 and 2009), Huddersfield&#x27;s McAlpine Stadium (twice in 1998), Manchester&#x27;s Etihad Stadium (2015), and St James&#x27; Park in Newcastle upon Tyne (2019).
The first of a two-test series, this match was originally scheduled to be held in Argentina but moved by the Argentine Rugby Union for financial reasons.
This was a Pool A match at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

England also played a Five Nations match against Wales at Wembley Stadium on 11 April 1999. Wales was the &quot;home team&quot; on this occasion because Wembley was being used as a temporary base while their new stadium in Cardiff was being constructed. Wales won the match (32–31).

=== &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; ===

&quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; is commonly sung at England fixtures, especially at Twickenham. In the last match of the 1988 season, against Ireland, three of England&#x27;s tries were scored by Chris Oti. A group of boys from the Benedictine school Douai, following a tradition at their school games, sang the song on his final try, and other spectators around the ground joined in. Since then &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; became a song to sing at England home games. In 1991, the RFU marketing director Mike Coley wanted the team to launch a song leading up to that year&#x27;s Rugby World Cup. He had wanted to use &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, but it was used in the Rugby League Challenge Cup final that year, so the song was changed at short notice to &quot;Swing Low&quot;. There were a number of versions recorded and the version released did reach the top 40 in the UK Singles Chart during the competition.

== Playing kit ==
England rugby union players typically wear all-white jerseys and white shorts, with predominantly navy blue socks. The emblem on the jerseys is a red rose. As of July 2023, the strip is manufactured by Umbro and the shirt sponsor is O2. The away strip is usually red or dark grey (described as &quot;anthracite&quot;); prior to the introduction of the grey strip, red was the traditional change colour. Navy blue has also been used in the past and was reintroduced for the 2016–17 and 2020–21 seasons. Purple was used during the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England tracksuits from the 1960s until the 1980s. The away strip was black for the first time during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. About that kit, the RFU stated that they had requested approval from the New Zealand Union, which said &quot;it has no qualms with England wearing the strip&quot;.
The Rugby Football Union (RFU) had created the national side&#x27;s emblem prior to an English team being sent to Edinburgh to play a Scottish side. A red rose was chosen to be the side&#x27;s emblem. The white kit worn by the national team was taken from the kit used at Rugby School. Alfred Wright, an employee of the Rugby Football Union, is credited with the standardisation and new design of the rose, which up until 1920 had undergone many variations in its depiction. The Wright design is thought to have been used without minor alteration until the late 1990s. It was not until 1997 that the rose was modernised, when Nike became the official strip supplier (with the stem section of the rose being green rather than brown as previously).

In 2003, England first used a skin-tight strip. This was intended to make it more difficult for the opposition to grasp the shirt when tackling.

== Performances ==
=== Six Nations ===
England competes annually in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. The Six Nations started out as the Home Nations Championship in 1883 which England won with a Triple Crown. England have won the title outright 29 times (a record for the tournament) and shared victory ten times. Their longest wait between championships was 18 years (1892–1910). During the Six Nations, England also contests the Calcutta Cup with Scotland (which England first won in 1880) and the Millennium Trophy with Ireland (which England first won in 1988). The matches between England and France are traditionally known as &quot;Le Crunch&quot;.

Note: England are the only team to have won more than two successive grand slams, on more than one occasion, doing so in 1913–1914, 1923–1924 and 1991–1992; while Wales and France the only other teams to have done so twice, in 1908–1909 for Wales and 1997–1998 for France.

=== Rugby World Cup ===

England have contested every Rugby World Cup since the tournament began in 1987, reaching the final four times and winning the title in the 2003 tournament.

In the inaugural tournament, England finished second in their pool before losing to Wales (3–16) in the quarter-finals. They again finished pool runners-up in 1991 but bounced back to beat France (19–10) in the quarter-finals, and then Scotland (9–6) in the semi-finals, en route to a (6–12) defeat to Australia in the final at Twickenham on 2 November 1991.

In 1995, England topped their pool and defeated Australia (25–22) at the quarter-final stage before being beaten by the All Blacks (29–45) in the semi-finals. They lost their bronze medal match (9–19) to France.

In the 1999 tournament, England again finished second in their pool. Although they proceeded to win a play-off game against Fiji (45–24), they went out of the tournament in the quarter-finals, losing (21–44) to South Africa.

England topped their pool in 2003 and progressed to the playoffs. They beat Wales (28–17) and France (24–7) in the quarter and semi-finals. With a drop goal in the last minute of extra time, England won the final (20–17) against Australia in Sydney on 22 November 2003.

England made a poor start to their title defence in 2007, with a below par victory over the United States and a heavy (0–36) defeat to South Africa, leaving the title holders on the brink of elimination at the pool stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga ensured that England again reached the knockout stage as pool runners-up. They defeated Australia (12–10) in the quarter-finals, and beat France (14–9) in the semi-finals. The victory over France gave England the chance to play in their 2nd consecutive final. In the final, held in Paris on 20 October, England lost (6–15) to South Africa, their second defeat by the Springboks during the 2007 tournament.

England topped their pool in 2011. They reached the quarter-finals but were defeated (12–19) to France.

In 2015, England became the first host nation to fail to qualify for the knockout stage, after losing to Wales and Australia in the pool stage.

In 2019, England topped their pool. They defeated Australia (40–19) and New Zealand (19–7) in the knockout stage. On 2 November 2019, they suffered a (12–32) defeat to South Africa in the final in Yokohama, becoming World Cup runners-up for the third time in their history.

In 2023, England topped their pool. They defeated Fiji in the quarter-finals (30–24) before losing to the eventual champions South Africa (15–16) in the semi-finals. They beat Argentina in the bronze medal match (26–23) to finish the tournament in 3rd place.

England&#x27;s Jonny Wilkinson is the highest points scorer in the Rugby World Cup, having scored 277 points between 1999 and 2011. England have the fourth most points and the fourth most tries scored in the Rugby World Cup.

=== Recent results ===
The following is a list of England&#x27;s recent match results, as well as upcoming scheduled fixtures, during the 12 months up to and including November 2025:















=== Overall ===
When the World Rugby Rankings were first introduced in early September 2003, England were ranked 1st; they fell to 2nd for a week in November 2003 before regaining 1st place. They again dropped to 2nd in the rankings, and then to 3rd, from mid-June 2004. Following the 2005 Six Nations, they fell to 6th in the world rankings, where they remained until moving up to 5th place in December of that year. After a decline in form in 2006, England finished the year ranked 7th; however, they bounced back to 3rd in 2007 due to their good run in that year&#x27;s World Cup, where they finished runners-up.

Their ranking slipped again in 2008 and during the 2009 Six Nations they dropped to their lowest ranking of 8th, where they remained for the duration of the 2009 autumn internationals. After a brief resurgence that saw them rise to a ranking of 4th in the world, England again slipped following a poor showing at the 2011 Rugby World Cup and were ranked 6th in February 2012. The team entered the 2015 Rugby World Cup ranked 4th, but after failing to progress beyond the pool stage, England again sank to 8th in the world in November 2015. In March 2016, after securing the Grand Slam in the 2016 Six Nations, England rose to second place, where they remained the following year after winning the 2017 Six Nations. A poor fifth-place performance in the 2018 Six Nations saw them fall to sixth place.

In October 2019, England defeated New Zealand in the semi-final of the 2019 Rugby World Cup to top the World Rugby Rankings for the first time since 2004. After losing the final to South Africa, England were ranked third. In November 2020, they regained second place following New Zealand&#x27;s loss to Argentina.

During the 2021 Six Nations, a fifth-place finish saw England fall from second to third after defeats to Scotland, Wales and Ireland. After Australia won 5 matches in a row during the 2021 Rugby Championship, England fell to fourth until defeats of Australia and South Africa in the 2021 Autumn Nations Series saw them regain third place.

During the 2022 Six Nations, England again suffered three defeats to Scotland, Ireland and France and fell from third to fifth.

England entered the 2023 Six Nations in fifth, but defeats to Scotland, France and Ireland again saw them fall to sixth.

During the 2023 World Cup warm-ups, England suffered further defeats away to Ireland and Wales and a first ever home lost to Fiji to enter the 2023 World Cup in eighth. A third-placed finish at the 2023 Rugby World Cup saw England rise to fifth.

During the 2024 Six Nations, England retained fifth positions despite away defeats against Scotland and France.

=== Club versus country ===
Although the England team is governed by the Rugby Football Union (RFU), players have been contracted to their clubs since the advent of professionalism in late 1995. Since then, players have often been caught in a &quot;power struggle&quot; between their clubs and the RFU; this is commonly referred to as a &quot;club versus country&quot; conflict. The first major dispute between England&#x27;s top clubs (who play in the English Premiership) and the RFU occurred in 1998, when some of the clubs refused to release players to tour Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The tour became known as the &quot;Tour from hell&quot; after an England squad of second-string players were defeated in all four Tests, including a 76–0 defeat by Australia. The clubs also withdrew from the 1998–99 Heineken Cup.

In 2001, the top clubs and the RFU formed &quot;England Rugby&quot; to help govern the club and international game. The parties agreed to restrict the number of matches at club and international level that elite players (a group of 50 or 60 players selected by the RFU) could play in order to reduce player burnout and injuries. In return for releasing players from club commitments, the clubs were to receive compensation from the RFU. This agreement was considered central to the England victory in the 2003 World Cup. Clive Woodward, England coach from November 1997, resigned in 2004 because he was unable to get the access to the players that he wanted: &quot;I wanted more from the union – more training days with the players, more influence over the way they were treated – and ended up with less.&quot; Andy Robinson, Woodward&#x27;s successor, blamed the lack of control over players for his team&#x27;s unsuccessful record. Brian Ashton, who took over from Robinson, intentionally named his playing squad for Six Nations matches in 2007 early in the hope that their clubs would not play them in the weekend prior to a Test. The RFU and the Premiership clubs are negotiating a similar deal to the one in 2001 that will enable international players to be released into the England squad prior to international matches.

=== Training ===
Pennyhill Park Hotel in Bagshot, Surrey, is the chosen training base for the team in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Loughborough University, Bisham Abbey and the University of Bath grounds served as training bases prior to this agreement. Martin Johnson noted the hotel&#x27;s facilities and its proximity to Twickenham and Heathrow as deciding factors in this decision. The team had their own pitchside gym and fitness rooms constructed on the hotel premises at the start of the long-term arrangement. Since its completion in 2010 the team also regularly use Surrey Sports Park at the University of Surrey in nearby Guildford for much of their training.

== Media coverage ==
England&#x27;s summer internationals are televised live on Sky Sports, while their autumn internationals are televised live by TNT Sports. Highlights of the autumn tests are currently not shown by a free-to-air broadcaster. As of 2024, all Six Nations games are broadcast free-to-air on the BBC and ITV.

<text>The International School of Geneva (in French: &quot;École internationale de Genève&quot;), commonly known as Ecolint, is a private, non-profit international school based in Geneva, Switzerland.

==Background==

Founded in 1924 in the service of the League of Nations and the International Labour Organization, it is the oldest international school. It was the result of a partnership between parents (Arthur Sweetser and Ludwik Rajchman) and educators from the Institut Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Adolphe Ferrière and Paul Meyhoffer). 

In the mid-1960s, a group of teachers from Ecolint (La Grande Boissière campus) created the International Schools Examinations Syndicate (ISES), which later became the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and then the International Baccalaureate (IB). 

Since its inception, the school&#x27;s mission has been conceived as educating for peace and the inculcation of humanitarian values such as inclusiveness, respect and inter-cultural understanding. It describes itself in its website as &quot;resolutely not-for-profit; mankind is the only beneficiary of our work, not corporate shareholders or private equity firms&quot;. In 2017, it was labelled by ITN as &quot;the most diverse school on the planet&quot;. Article 4 of Ecolint&#x27;s Charter states that &quot;the activity of the school in all fields and especially in the field of pedagogy shall be based on the principles of equality and solidarity among all peoples and of the equal value of all human beings without any distinction of nationality, race, sex, language or religion&quot;.

Ecolint comprises three campuses in and around Geneva, each with its own principal (also known as &quot;director&quot;) working under the Director General of the Foundation of the International School of Geneva and a Governing Board elected by parents, staff and alumni with members from the UN and Swiss Government. Ecolint is a bilingual school, with instruction primarily in English and French. In addition to the IB, it is a testing centre for the US college boards (SAT and ACT) and the British IGCSE (CIE). Ecolint is a member of the G30 Schools Group.

==History==

The history of Ecolint has been charted in four volumes published in different decades. The first, bilingual one (&quot;Ecole Internationale de Genève – Son premier demi-siècle / International School of Geneva – the first 50 years&quot;, Geneva: 1974, 311 pages), edited by René Lejeune (better known as René-François Lejeune), compiles the contributions and eyewitness accounts of various authors, including the historian Robert J. Leach and Ecolint&#x27;s second director, Marie-Thérèse Maurette. The second one (&quot;Ecolint – A portrait of the International School of Geneva, 1924–1999&quot;, Geneva: 1999, 218 pages) was written by the historian Michael Knight. The third volume (&quot;Marie-Thérèse Maurette – Pioneer of International Education&quot;, Geneva: 2009, 84 pages), which focuses specifically on the director who headed the school between 1929 and 1949, was authored by Professor George Walker, former Director General of Ecolint and of the International Baccalaureate Organization. The fourth and final volume to date (&quot;Ecolint – A History of the International School of Geneva&quot;, Geneva: 2014, 170 pages) is the joint work of educators Conan de Wilde (an alumnus of the school) and Othman Hamayed (a former director of La Grande Boissière&#x27;s Secondary School). In addition, Robert J. Leach published privately in 1974 his own account of the school’s history, &quot;International School of Geneva, 1924–1974&quot; (63 pages). Most recently, the geographer and economist Phil Thomas, who served as interim Director General and held a wide range of teaching positions in the school during his 35-year Ecolint career, published the booklet &quot;Ecolint and the Origins of the International Baccalaureate&quot; in 2018.

From 1920 to 1921 the League of Nations and the International Labour Office established their headquarters in Geneva. In 1924 the International School of Geneva was founded by senior members of these two international organizations, most notably Arthur Sweetser and Ludwik Rajchman, in partnership with Adolphe Ferrière and Paul Meyhoffer, educators from Geneva&#x27;s &quot;Institut Jean-Jacques Rousseau&quot;. Meyhoffer, originally trained as a theologian, had previously taught at Bedales School in England and, for eight years, at the &quot;Ecole Nouvelle de la Châtaigneraie&quot; (also known as &quot;Ecole Nouvelle du Léman&quot;), which in 1974 was integrated into Ecolint.

Ferrière housed the first class in a chalet that was part of his family&#x27;s estate, on the Route de Florissant in Geneva. He was also technical adviser to the school from 1924 to 1926. The nascent school was supported by William Rappard, Rector of the University of Geneva, the neurologist and child psychologist Édouard Claparède, and Sir Arthur Salter, a senior official of the League of Nations. After occupying rented accommodation on the Rue Charles Bonnet in Geneva&#x27;s &quot;Vieille ville&quot; (Old Town), the school finally acquired its own premises in 1929: a historic site known as &quot;La Grande Boissière&quot;. The acquisition of this large property was made financially possible by Arthur Sweetser, who personally gave the school thousands of dollars and sought contributions from his network of affluent acquaintances. These donations included 25,000 U.S. dollars from John D. Rockefeller Jr.

Among Ecolint’s notable teachers during the early decades of its existence were Paul Dupuy, formerly doyen (dean) at Paris’ Ecole normale supérieure and defender of Alfred Dreyfus in the late 1890s; the psychoanalyst Charles Baudouin; the philosopher Jeanne Hersch; and the novelist Michel Butor.

The school became a foundation in 1968, and continued to evolve as it acquired new campuses. In 1974 it incorporated as its second campus La Châtaigneraie (also called &quot;La Chât&quot;), which had originally been founded in 1908 as the &quot;Ecole Nouvelle La Châtaigneraie&quot; (later known as &quot;Collège Protestant Romand&quot;) near Founex in the Canton of Vaud.

== Campuses ==
*&quot;La Grande Boissière&quot; (also called &quot;LGB&quot;) is the largest of the three campuses and has been a part of Ecolint since 1929. The primary school (beginning from age three) has approximately 550 students, and runs through grade 4. The middle school also has about 550 students, and runs from grade 5 to grade 8. The secondary school has around 800 students, beginning with 9th grade and going to grade 12 or 13. All three stages offer bilingual programmes.
*&quot;La Châtaigneraie&quot; (also called &quot;La Chât&quot;) became part of Ecolint in 1973 and is located in the Vaud countryside, near Founex, overlooking the Alps and Lake Léman. It has a primary and a secondary school, and has approximately 1600 students. Despite joining Ecolint after LGB, the oldest building on campus is the main secondary building which was completed in 1908, when La Châtaigneraie first opened, making it the oldest campus and longest-running educational establishment among the three.
*&quot;Campus des Nations&quot; (also simply called &quot;Nations&quot;) opened in 2005 and operates on two locations in and in the vicinity of Grand Saconnex. It has around 1000 students. Campus des Nations is the only campus to offer all four IB programmes (PYP, MYP, IBDP and IBCP).
* &quot;Saconnex&quot; is located near the International Labour Organization and World Health Organization headquarters. Saconnex offers classes to 800 students from years 3 through 13. All classes taught at Nations follow the IB curriculum, consisting of PYP, MYP and DP or CP.
* &quot;Pregny&quot; (in Pregny-Chambésy) is located near the United Nations and Red Cross HQ and is a school of 200 students from pre-school and kindergarten to year 2.

==Accreditation==
===Swiss===
International School of Geneva&#x27;s (upper) secondary education (middle and high school) is not listed as a &quot;Collège&quot; by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI). Nonetheless, education leading to the Maturité Fédérale (Federal Matura) is offered at the La Châtaigneraie campus, including the option to undertake the bilingual (English/French) Maturité. 

===International===
Ecolint&#x27;s various programmes are accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the Middle States Association (MSA).

Ecolint has satisfied the authorization procedures of the International Baccalaureate (IB) to offer the PYP, MYP, IBDP, and IBCP.

==Governance==
The Governing Board appoints the Director General to which the latter is accountable. All alumni, current parents, teachers and other employees may vote in the Governing Board elections and may be elected as members. Three seats are permanently reserved for members appointed by the Cantons of Geneva and Vaud, and by the United Nations. The school’s personnel are represented on the Board by three appointed or elected observers (one from each campus), and the Staff Association has the right to nominate for full membership someone who is not a current employee of the school. Parents typically constitute a majority on the Governing Board. Kofi Annan was a member of the Board from 1981 to 1983. Ecolint’s governance was inspired by the direct democratic mechanisms of Switzerland. The Governing Board is accountable to all community members (parents, personnel and alumni) at the annual Consultative General Assembly and, when convened by members of the Ecolint community, at Extraordinary Consultative General Assemblies. In February 2002, one of these assemblies, held at the United Nations, was attended by some 1,000 people. It gave rise to a no-confidence referendum in June of that year involving all the school&#x27;s eligible voters, the outcome of which forced the resignation of both the Governing Board’s Executive Committee and of the Director General.

==Notable alumni==
The Charter of the International School of Geneva gives all registered alumni the right to vote in the elections for the school&#x27;s Governing Board, and to be elected as Governing Board members.

<text>Landon Curt Noll (born October 28, 1960) is an American computer scientist, co-discoverer of the 25th Mersenne prime and discoverer of the 26th, which he found while still enrolled at Hayward High School and concurrently at California State University, Hayward.

==Biography==
Noll was born in Walnut Creek, California, United States. At age 18, he became the youngest person to break the record for the largest known prime. He has held or co-held the record three times.
He is also the co-inventor (with John Horton Conway) of a system for naming arbitrarily large powers of 10.
He also helped start the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, and is a co-inventor of the Fowler Noll Vo hash function.

He was also a member of the Amdahl Six team (John S. Brown, Bodo Parady, Curt Landon Noll, Gene W. Smith, Joel F. Smith, and Sergio E. Zarantonello) which discovered another record prime in 1989; this prime remains unusual as a record large prime as it was not a Mersenne prime.

Noll is an amateur astronomer. His work includes measuring the Solar parallax during the 2004 Transit of Venus as well as the search for Vulcanoid asteroids.

He was also involved in politics as a Sunnyvale, California city council member and vice-mayor.

<doc id="691057" wikidata="Q762943" url="?curid=691057" title="County of Holland">
<text>The County of Holland was a state of the Holy Roman Empire from its inception until 1433. From 1433 onward it was part of the Burgundian Netherlands, from 1482 part of the Habsburg Netherlands and from 1581 onward the leading province of the Dutch Republic until the Batavian Revolution in 1795. The territory of the County of Holland corresponds roughly with the current provinces of North Holland and South Holland in the Netherlands.

The County of Holland was the first Holy Roman county in the area to reach the level of economic, cultural, military, and technological development it did, having had time to undergo this development before the area became classed as a county.

==Etymology==
The oldest sources refer to the not clearly defined county as &quot;Frisia&quot;, west of the Vlie (also known as West Frisia). Before 1101, sources talk about Frisian counts, but in this year Floris II, Count of Holland, is mentioned as &quot;Florentius comes de Hollant&quot; (Floris, Count of Holland). Another early usage of the word is a deed dated 1083 in which Dirk V used the term &quot;Count of Holland&quot; for himself. Holland is probably from the Old Dutch , literally &quot;wood land&quot;. The counts of Holland generally kept to this single title until 1291, when Floris V, Count of Holland decided to call himself &quot;Count of Holland and Zeeland, Lord of Friesland&quot;. This title was also used after Holland was united with Hainault, Bavaria-Straubing, and the Duchy of Burgundy. The titles eventually lost their importance, and the last count, Philip II of Spain, only mentioned them halfway through his long list of titles.

==History==

===Francia and Lotharingia===

Around 800, under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire covered much of Europe. In much of this empire, an important unit of regional administration (corresponding roughly to a shire or county in England) was the &quot;gau&quot; (Frankish) or &quot;pagus&quot; (Latin). A &quot;comes&quot; (count) ruled one or more &quot;gaue&quot;. Because of the low volume of trade, the negative trade balance with the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim states and the disappearance of currency, the economy was more or less reduced to barter. The king&#x27;s vassals could be rewarded only with land (&quot;beneficium&quot; or, from the tenth century, &quot;feodum&quot;) and usufruct, and feudalism developed from that. The vassals, who were generally appointed by the king, strove for a system of inheritance. This informal rule became more widespread and in 877 was legalised in the Capitulary of Quierzy.

Upon the death of a king, the Frankish kingdom was frequently divided among his heirs. The system of partible inheritance often caused internal strife, which made centralized government problematic. The Viking raids further undermined centralized government. At the end of the reign of Emperor Louis the Pious, royal power had weakened by the flood of 838 and by infighting between the king&#x27;s sons. After Louis died in 840, his son, Emperor Lothair I, who was king of Middle Francia, rewarded the Danish Viking brothers Rorik and Harald with Frisia in an attempt to resist Viking attacks.

When Lothair died in 855, the northern part of Middle Francia was awarded to his second son, Lothair II, and was called Lotharingia. 

Rorik was granted the right to rule Kennemerland in 862.

The 880 Treaty of Ribemont added the Kingdom of Lotharingia (which included the Low Countries) to East Francia, which attempted to integrate it. However, there were no strong political connections like those between the four German stem duchies of east Francia: Franconia, the Saxony, the Bavaria and the Swabia. Lotharingia had considerable self-determination; this became clear when Louis the Child, East Francia&#x27;s last Carolingian, died in 911. Although the stem duchies flocked to Duke Conrad I of Franconia, Lotharingia chose the Carolingian king of West Francia, Charles the Simple.
In Frisia, the situation was complex. Power was in the hands of Rorik&#x27;s successor, Godfrid, who became embroiled in the politics of the Frankish empire and was allied with the children of Lothair II. Danish rule ended in 885 with the murder of Godfrid at Herispijk, and all Danes east of the coastal areas of West Frisia were killed or driven out in what must have been a complex, successful conspiracy. Henry of Franconia led a coalition of Babenberg Franks, Hamaland Saxons and Teisterbant Frisians (in cooperation with the bishop of Cologne and the Emperor), which outsmarted Godfrid and the Danes. The chief conspirator in the murder was Everard Saxo, count of Hamaland. One of those who profited most from the power vacuum was the Frisian Gerolf, &quot;comes Fresonum&quot; (count of Frisia), from Westergo in the present-day province of Friesland. Gerolf, Godfrid&#x27;s former envoy to the emperor, demanded lands in the Moselle valley from the emperor to provoke a war. 

After the elimination of a large portion of the Danish population, Gerulf controlled a large Frisian part of the later county of Holland. This &quot;fait accompli&quot; was recognised when Gerolf was given lands in full ownership on 4 August 889 by the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia, who needed strong warlords in the delta region to keep the Danes and other Vikings out. The lands in question included an area outside Gerulf&#x27;s county, in Teisterbant, which included Tiel, Aalburg and Asch. It also involved a forest and field between the mouth of the Old Rhine (and presumably Bennebroek), Suithardeshaga, the border between the former Frankish counties of Rijnland and Kennemerland. A line of Gerulf&#x27;s descendants became the Counts of Holland.

King Charles the Simple gave the church in Egmond and its possessions to Count Dirk I of Holland in 922 in gratitude for Dirk&#x27;s support in the Battle of Soissons to suppress a rebellion of his West Frankish vassals. The West Frankish king was able to do this because the lands and churches he granted to Dirk were outside his jurisdiction; Egmond was just north of possessions which Dirk had received from Gerulf and was a good match. He then founded Egmond Abbey, Holland&#x27;s oldest monastery. When Charles the Simple was deposed in 923, King Henry the Fowler of East Francia allied with Count Gilbert of Hainaut (son of Duke Reginar of Lorraine) and re-conquered Lotharingia. By 925, the Lotharingian nobles accepted his rule and Lotharingia (with the Frisian lands) became a fifth German stem duchy. Henry&#x27;s power was limited by his vassal, Gilbert (Duke of Lotharingia), whose power was limited to his own counties.

===Imperial State===

The rising status of the House of Holland was shown when in 938 Count Dirk II, probably the grandson of Count Dirk I, married at the age of 8 with Hildegard of Flanders, daughter of Count Arnulf I of Flanders. 

The County of Holland and other nearby territories had a considerable amount of independence from Holy Roman Empire leadership in the 10th and 11th centuries. Until at least the second half of the 10th century, Holland&#x27;s leadership valued secular principles, a contrast to the nearby Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht.

The count of Holland was in this period more of a military commander who had to resist Viking raids, and be subject to the authority of the Bishopric of Utrecht. In 985, King Otto III, at the request of his mother Theophanu, granted the ownership (&quot;proprium&quot;) of a number of lands to count Dirk II. These lands had already been given in loan (&quot;beneficium&quot;). This was the area between the rivers &quot;Loira&quot; or Lier and &quot;Hisla&quot; (a gouw called Masaland), &quot;villa Sunnimeri&quot; (on the Zeelandish island of Schouwen), the area between the rivers &quot;Medemelaka&quot; and &quot;Chinnelosara gemerchi&quot; (Kinheim) and the gouw Texla.

In 993, count Arnulf of Ghent was killed in a battle against Frisian land reclaimers who did not want to pay their due to the count. It is unknown where this battle took place but it was probably in the Rijnland or in the Maas estuary. Arnulf&#x27;s son, count Dirk III of Holland was too young to rule, so his mother Lutgardis of Luxemburg acted as regent. In 1005 Dirk was old enough to rule in his own name, but he still made thankful use of the good connections that his mother had made. According to Thietmar of Merseburg, a reconciliation with the Frisians was arranged with help from his uncle-in-law, king Henry II, who travelled with an army and a fleet from Utrecht to the Maas-estuary (probably Vlaardingen) to force the inhabitants to recognize their count. This expedition appears to have been successful since after 1005 no revolts against the count in this southern part of the later county of Holland are known.

As a result of a promise he had made during the Frisian rebellion, Dirk III went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. When he returned, the northern side of his county had become unsafe, so he travelled south and started granting rights to reclaim lands from nature around present-day Vlaardingen in order to cultivate these lands. He also built a castle at &quot;Silva Meriwido&quot;, the future Vlaardingen. From this castle, he forced merchants that travelled per ship from Tiel to England to pay toll. The Bishop of Utrecht, Adalbold and the merchants of Tiel complained against this piracy at the Reichstag of Nijmegen in 1018, the merchants of Tiel effectively pointing out that the emperor was losing tax revenue when he allowed the Tiel merchants to being plundered by Dirk III. It was decided to act against Dirk III. An army led by Godfrey II Duke of Lower Lorraine, consisting of a fleet with soldiers from the bishops of Utrecht, Cologne, Cambrai and Liège was however surprisingly ambushed in a swamp and nearly annihilated by Dirk III Frisian subjects in what was called the Battle of Vlaardingen, Dirk III himself playing a coordinating role, only to appear from his castle to officially take prisoner the duke of Lower Lorraine, when Godfrey was on the verge of being killed.

So as not to weaken the protection the county of Holland offered against the Viking raids, King Henry II decided to let the matter rest, though he did strengthen the position of the Bishop of Utrecht, the nominal feudal lord of the counts of Holland. Nonetheless, Dirk managed to expand his territory to the east at the cost of the Bishopric of Utrecht. After the death of Henry II in 1024, Dirk III supported the candidature of Conrad II in an attempt to reconcile with the imperial authorities, so as to keep the lands he had acquired or expand them even further.

Emperor Conrad II died during a stay in Utrecht in 1039 during the rule of bishop Bernold, after which his organs were interred in the Cathedral of Utrecht. His son and successor, Henry III, granted numerous favors to the bishopric of Utrecht. In this way, the Oversticht was assigned to the bishopric in 1040. Though the count of Holland had been reconciled with the emperor, Henry III still decided to punish the count. In 1046 the emperor forced Dirk IV to relinquish the lands he had conquered. However, the emperor was not able to maintain himself in the area and was forced to retreat, after which Dirk IV started to raid and plunder the bishoprics of Utrecht and Liège. Moreover, Dirk signed treaties with Godfrey the Bearded, duke of Lower Lorraine, as well as the counts of Flanders and Hainaut. The Emperor responded with a second punitive expedition in which Vlaardingen and the castle at Rijnsburg were taken from Dirk IV. The castle was completely destroyed. However, the emperor suffered heavy losses during his retreat, upon which Dirk&#x27;s allies openly revolted against the emperor. In 1049 Dirk IV was lured into a trap and killed by assassins hired by the bishops of Metz, Liège and Utrecht. Dirk died young, unmarried and childless. He was succeeded by his brother Floris I.

Floris I managed to expand his territory with a small area within the Rijnland Gouw, an area called &quot;Holtland&quot; (&quot;Woodland&quot;), or &quot;Holland&quot;. It is most likely that this name soon became synonymous with Floris&#x27; whole territory. In 1061 a war broke out, in which it is not clear whether it was against Brabant, Utrecht or Liège. During this war, Floris was ambushed while relaxing too much and in too small a company when he was raiding in the former Teisterbant county, now Utrechtian territory. He was killed by either Utrechtian or Gueldrian troops. His son Dirk V was still a minor, so his mother Gertrude of Saxony became regent. Gertrude remarried in 1063 with Robert the Frisian, a younger brother of the count of Flanders, Baldwin VI and a grandson of a former French king, Robert II, who also acted as regent for Dirk V.

In 1064, Emperor Henry IV donated lands belonging to the county of Holland, &#x27;west of the Vlie and around the banks of the Rhine&#x27; (the gouw of Westflinge), to William, Bishop of Utrecht, on whose support the Emperor could count. Dirk V was only allowed to keep the gouw of Masaland. Through battles in 1071 and 1072, William of Utrecht, with support from the highly competent Duke Godfrey IV of Lower Lorraine, managed to gain actual central control over nearly the entire later county of Holland for the first time. Robert the Frisian and Dirk V had to flee to Ghent. This could have been the end of the Gerulfingian dynasty. Robert the Frisian managed however against some odds to become count of Flanders in 1076 when in the battle of Cassel he managed to beat a grand coalition of Hainaut, French and Normandian forces. Being now the count of Flanders he was able to assist his stepson to reclaim the county of Holland. The pair started by taking out their most dangerous adversary. Godfrey IV was killed at night while defecating. Shortly afterwards the formidable bishop William of Utrecht also died. After this Robert I and his stepson Dirk V besieged the new Utrecht/Lotharingian castle at a strategic place at the delta in IJsselmonde, where the Hollandse IJssel (still existing) joined the Merwede (not existing any more in the form of 1000 years ago). In the battle of IJsselmonde they managed to capture the new bishop Conrad of Swabia, who was now forced to return the lands to Dirk V&#x27;s control. In 1101, the name &quot;Holland&quot; first appears in a deed.

Holland&#x27;s influence continued to gradually grow over the next two centuries. The counts of Holland were able to conquer most of Zeeland, to diminish the power of bishops of Utrecht and from the start of the 12th until the 13th century fight a 150-year-long war against the inhabitants of the area living at the east side of North Holland, also confusingly known as &quot;West-Frisians&quot;. It was not until 1289 that Count Floris V was able to bring this long war to an end and subjugate these West Frisians, this only after the St. Lucia&#x27;s flood in 1287 had completely devastated nearly all the lands of the West-Frisians. After this, the county was officially known until 1795 as the county of Holland and West Friesland.

===Burgundians and Habsburgs===

The Hook and Cod Wars were a series of wars and battles in Holland between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of count, but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the bourgeois in the cities against the ruling nobility. The Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of Holland. The Hook faction consisted of a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were William IV, Margaret, William V, William VI, Count of Holland and Hainaut, John and Philip the Good. Perhaps the most well known, however, is Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut. By the end of the Hook and Cod Wars, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, had taken control of Holland. Leading noblemen in Holland had invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the Flemish economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions.

Under the Burgundians, Holland&#x27;s trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the Hanseatic League several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.

Charles (1500–58) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by mostly French speaking Burgundians he controlled. Holland retained its own governments and court, controlled by the local nobility, and its own traditions and rights (&quot;liberties&quot;) dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this, however, the Burgundians had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.

===Revolt and the Dutch Republic===

During the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation rapidly gained ground in northern Europe, especially in its Lutheran and Calvinist forms. Protestants in Holland, after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities. By the 1560s, the Protestant community had become a significant influence in the county, although it clearly formed a minority then. In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V and his successor Philip II felt it was their duty to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system. The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the Spanish Inquisition. Calvinists rebelled. First, there was the iconoclasm in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. After 1566 William the Silent, more or less by accident became the leader of a revolt that by severe mismanagement by Philip II and his governor the Duke of Alva turned into the Eighty Years&#x27; War. As a consequence, Holland and the other six allied provinces became an independent nation called the Republic of the Seven United Provinces. Over William of Orange Blum says, &quot;His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.&quot; The main breakthrough came when Holland, along with Zeeland, was conquered in 1572 and following years by the Watergeuzen, a somehow effective maritime force of mainly Calvinists who turned pirate and pirates who turned Calvinist.
The States General of the Netherlands signed the Act of Abjuration, deposing Philip as Count of Holland and forming a confederation between the seven liberated provinces. From then on, the executive and legislative power would again rest with the States of Holland and West Friesland, which were led by a political figure who held the office of Grand Pensionary. The county, now a sovereign state within this larger confederation, became the cultural, political and economic centre of the Dutch Republic, in the 17th century, the Dutch Golden Age, the wealthiest nation in the world. The largest cities in the republic were situated in the province of Holland, such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Leiden, Alkmaar, Delft, Dordrecht, Haarlem, and the nation&#x27;s capital, The Hague. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over Europe, and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland. Many Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as &quot;Holland&quot; rather than as the &quot;Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands&quot;. A strong impression of &quot;Holland&quot; was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a &quot;Hollandification&quot; of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. In the early decades of the uprising, a great number of refugees from Flanders and Brabant settled in the big cities of Holland. They had a Frankish influence on the new dialect of urban Holland (that earlier had more Frisian influences) that in later centuries became the standard language of the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking Belgium.

Nominally, the County of Holland formally came to an end in 1795, when the Batavian Revolution ended the republic and reformed it as the Batavian Republic. The territory of the former county was divided between the departments of the &quot;Amstel&quot;, &quot;Delf&quot;, &quot;Texel&quot;, and &quot;Schelde en Maas&quot;. After 1813, Holland was restored as a province of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. Holland was divided into the present provinces North Holland and South Holland in 1840.

==Geography==

The county covered an area roughly corresponding to the current Dutch provinces of North Holland and South Holland, as well as the northwestern part of the current province of North Brabant (roughly between the towns of Willemstad, Geertruidenberg and Werkendam), and the islands of Terschelling, Vlieland, Urk and Schokland, though it did not include the island of Goeree-Overflakkee.

In the early Middle Ages, large parts of the area covered by the present-day Netherlands were covered by peat bogs. These bogs limited the size of arable land in the Netherlands, but also proved to be a good source of fuel. Around 950, small-scale reclamation was started on the enormous bogs in Holland and Utrecht, probably set in motion by the minor nobility. In the 11th century the &#x27;Great Reclamation&#x27; started, under the control of the counts of Holland and the bishops of Utrecht. Until the 13th century, large amounts of land were reclaimed between the IJ bay in the north, the dunes in the west, the Lek and Waal rivers in the south and the Old Rhine in the east.

Before the Great Reclamation, the borders between the county of Holland and the bishopric of Utrecht were unclear, and there existed a literal no-man&#x27;s land. However, during the reclamation the counts of Holland managed to expand their influence at the cost of Utrecht.

<text>John Stokesley (8 September 1475 – 8 September 1539) was an English clergyman who was Bishop of London during the reign of Henry VIII.

==Life==
Stokesley was born at Collyweston in Northamptonshire, and became a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1495, serving also as a lecturer. He graduated MA in 1500, and was successively ordained a deacon in 1504, a priest in 1505, and then proceeded DTh in 1516. In 1498 he was made principal of Magdalen Hall, and in 1505 vice-president of Magdalen College. Soon after 1509 he was appointed a member of the royal council, and chaplain and almoner to Henry VIII; he attended Henry as his chaplain at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. He succeeded his relative Richard Stokesley as rector of North Luffenham, Rutland, in 1527.

In 1529 and 1530 he went to France and Italy as ambassador to Francis I and to gain opinions from foreign universities in favour of the king&#x27;s divorce from Catherine of Aragon.

He became Bishop of London and Lord Almoner in 1530, and in September 1533 christened the future Queen Elizabeth. His later years were troubled by disputes with Archbishop Cranmer; Stokesley opposed all changes in the doctrines of the church, remaining hostile to the English Bible and fought to maintain all seven traditional sacraments, shrines and pilgrimages. Stokesley was a staunch opponent of Lutheranism, and very active in persecuting heretics: John Foxe claimed Stokesley boasted on his deathbed of having been the means of executing over thirty heretics.

In May 1538, the King&#x27;s attorney took out a writ of Praemunire against Stokesley and, as accessories with him, against the Abbess Agnes Jordan and the Confessor-General of Syon Abbey. Stokesley acknowledged his guilt, implored Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s intercession, and threw himself on the King&#x27;s mercy. He obtained the King&#x27;s pardon.

He was one of the primary architects of the Six Articles of 1539, which enshrined traditional religion into law. They became law in June 1539.

Stokesley died on 8 September 1539, and was buried in Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 14 September 1539.

==Works==
Stokesley was a man of learning. He was well-versed in philosophy and theology, and had knowledge of the classical languages of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He wrote in favour of Henry&#x27;s divorce, and with Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, a treatise against Henry VIII&#x27;s kinsman Cardinal Pole.

<text>Petersfield is a market town and civil parish in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. It is north of Portsmouth. The town has its own railway station on the Portsmouth Direct line, the mainline rail link connecting Portsmouth and London. Situated below the northern slopes of the South Downs, Petersfield lies wholly within the South Downs National Park.

The town is on the crossroads of well-used north–south (formerly the A3 road which now bypasses the town) and east–west routes (today the A272 road) and it grew as a coach stop on the Portsmouth to London route. Petersfield is twinned with Barentin in France, and Warendorf in Germany.

==History==
Petersfield Heath&#x27;s burial mounds may be up to 4,000 years old; their distribution is mainly to the east and south east of the Heath. These are considered to be one of the more important lowland barrow groups in this country. The barrows indicate that the area of the Heath was occupied by people who may have come to regard this area as sacred to their religion. As yet no trace has been confirmed for the dwellings of these people as the structures would have been wooden but Petersfield Museum hosts a community project to throw more light on this period of history.
The town was founded during the 12th century by William FitzRobert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, later chartered by his widow, Hawise de Beaumont, and confirmed by charter in 1198 from &quot;John, Count of Mortain&quot; (later to be King John). In 1415 King Henry V granted the burgesses of Petersfield freedom from toll, stallage, picage, pannage, murage, and pontage throughout the realm of England. All charters are preserved in the archive files at Petersfield Town Council.

The town grew in prosperity due to its position on frequently travelled routes, local sheep farming, and cottage industries including leather and cloth. There were weekly markets in the town square for sheep, horse and cattle trading, and two annual fairs, in June (on the feast of St Peter and St Paul) and November (on the feast of St Andrew). An autumn fair which began in the early 19th century was held in October on The Heath, called &quot;The Taro Fair&quot;.

The town&#x27;s market square has an 18th-century equestrian statue of King William III by John Cheere. The king is mounted and the statue is on an engraved plinth. It is one of only five statues of William in the United Kingdom outside Northern Ireland (the others being in Glasgow, Brixham, Hull and Bristol) and, as such, attracts bands of marching Orangemen in mid-July to commemorate William&#x27;s victory at the Battle of the Boyne.

==Geography==
Petersfield is situated in the valley of the Western Rother, on the Lower Greensand at the northern edge of the South Downs. The town lies at the western end of the Greensand Ridge, a sandstone ridge running through Hampshire, Surrey and Kent.

The town is surrounded on all sides by farmed countryside, with the South Downs south of the town, the Hampshire Downs to the west, and forested hills (Durford Wood) to the north east.

The town is a centre for exploring the South Downs National Park.
Close to the town and situated on the South Downs is Queen Elizabeth Country Park, which incorporates Butser Hill (270 metres), and has a variety of scenery including chalk hills, beech woodland and pine forest. The Hangers Way footpath starts from the country park, goes to Buriton, through Petersfield and in to Alton.

On the south east side of the town is Petersfield Heath, of heathland including woodland, grassland, a pond, and a picnic and recreation area. Petersfield Heath is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI). It also contains 21 Bronze Age barrows which have resulted in the site being given Scheduled Ancient Monument status.

Heathland is very rare throughout Europe and Petersfield Heath is a typical heathland mosaic of micro habitats. Across the site are sandy heath and acid heath areas, grassland and scrub which gives the area diverse zones for insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals.

Petersfield Heath is at one end of &quot;The Serpent Trail&quot;, a walk through heath and downland of Hampshire and West Sussex to Haslemere.

Petersfield Cemetery, situated in Ramshill, was opened in 1857.

==Attractions==
===Fairs and festivals===
On the nearest week-end to 6 October every year the Taro Fair is held on Petersfield Heath, a reminder of cattle fairs that were held annually until the 1950s.
It is now a fun fair.
(&quot;Tarw&quot; is the Welsh shout by the herders for &quot;Bull&quot;; pronounced &quot;Taro&quot; in English).

Free festivals are held throughout the year. The Petersfield Spring Festival over the May Bank Holiday weekend, the Petersfield Summer Festival over the August Bank Holiday weekend and the Petersfield Christmas Festival Market on the first Sunday in December. These are organised by a Community Interest Company called &quot;Petersfield Community Events, based in the town.

The town also plays host to an annual &quot;Scooter Sunday&quot; festival, a mod-themed event which sees several hundred scooter riders gather in the square and live music. The event is organised by The Five Fifteen, a local menswear retailer.

===Markets===
Petersfield&#x27;s market square holds markets every Wednesday and Saturday, there are also monthly Farmers&#x27; markets. Stallholders and farmers from Petersfield&#x27;s French twin town Barentin visit Petersfield and hold a &quot;French market&quot;.

===Gardens===

In the High Street is the physic garden, which is a recreation of a 17th-century herb garden. It is open to the public nearly every day of the year. Next to the Red Lion public house is the small Charles Dickens garden.

Within it are the Flora Twort Gallery, the Bedales Historic costume collection, which consists of over 1,000 pieces dating from 1720, and the Edward Thomas collection. The museum also exhibits social-history collections made up from maps, photographs, archives, oral history and artefacts related to the history of the town. Exhibitions are sometimes also held at the Festival Hall, St Peter&#x27;s Church, and the Physic Garden.

Petersfield was once home to the world&#x27;s first Teddy Bear Museum, which opened in 1984. It closed at the end of 2006, and is now a private house.

===Youth club===
The King&#x27;s Arms is a youth club situated near the town centre, started by Petersfield Area Churches Together (PACT), a charitable Christian organisation. The Kings Arms now runs independently.

===Cinema===
Petersfield had a 700-seat cinema, the Savoy, that opened in the late 1930s. It was built on the site of the Petersfield Electric Theatre, which had been built in 1910. During the 1970s its use converted to a Bingo Hall before closure in January 1985. After six years of closure, the building saw use as a nightclub from 1993 for some years, first under the name &quot;Oscars&quot;, then from 1999 as &quot;Vertigo&quot;. It closed in May 2007 and was demolished in May 2008. The site is now occupied by residential flats and a retail store.

== Religion ==
The parish church of St Peter, after which the town is named, is the Anglican church of Norman origins in the town centre, The Square. Other churches include Methodist (Station Road), Catholic (St Laurence&#x27;s, Station Road) and United Reformed Church (College Street).

The Salvation Army has been in Petersfield since 1886 and has been situated in Swan Street since 1924. The hall is open most days with various community activities, serving the community in the traditional ways of the Salvation Army. 

The Evangelical fellowship meets at the Herne Farm Leisure Centre on the eponymous estate, the Religious Society of Friends in the Voluntary Centre, High Street.

Life Church Petersfield, formerly Petersfield Christian Fellowship, has an office in Chapel Street and meets in the Methodist Church Hall located in Station Road.

==Transport==

Petersfield railway station is on the Portsmouth Direct line between London and Portsmouth. A branch line to Midhurst closed in 1955. The main station buildings date from the opening of the line in 1859 and are of a &quot;town&quot; type.

Petersfield stood at a major crossroads until the A3 London to Portsmouth road was bypassed to the west of the town. The A272 bypasses the town via the A3 and a link road to Sheet on its route between Winchester, Hampshire&#x27;s county town, and Heathfield, East Sussex.

==Schools==

===State schools===
The local state secondary school is The Petersfield School, usually referred to as &#x27;TPS&#x27;. Primary schools are Petersfield Infant School, Sheet Primary School and Herne Junior School. A number of other local primary schools (Langrish, East Meon, West Meon, Steep and Buriton) feed into the Petersfield secondary schools.

Petersfield lacks a state-sector sixth-form. Pupils normally continue their education at Havant and South Downs College, Bohunt Sixth Form or Alton College.

===Independent schools===
The town and the surrounding villages are home to several independent schools. Churcher&#x27;s College is in Petersfield, and counts Tim Rodber and Tiny Rowland amongst its former pupils. Ditcham Park School is just outside the town, and Bedales School is in the neighbouring village of Steep.

The former Moreton House School in the town centre was bought by Churcher&#x27;s College in 1993 to become Churcher&#x27;s College Junior School, but it soon outgrew these premises and subsequently relocated to Liphook. The old Moreton House school site was converted to housing.

==Local media==
Regional local news and television programmes are BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Midhurst TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent, Heart South and Delta Radio was the local radio station for the area until 2010 when it merged with Kestrel FM from Basingstoke. It became The Breeze in December 2012. That station was closed in September 2020 and replaced by a national service, Greatest Hits Radio. A local volunteer group tested the potential for a non-profit community radio service in January 2019 and began making local speech podcasts that year. In August 2020 it started a 24-hour local radio service for Petersfield called Petersfield&#x27;s Shine Radio. The service broadcasts online. ITV News Chief Correspondent Richard Gaisford is among the project&#x27;s supporters.

Petersfield has three weekly newspapers, The Petersfield Messenger, Petersfield Post and Petersfield Herald. There is a monthly community magazine, Life in Petersfield.

==Commerce, business, industry==
There is employment in shops and offices in the town centre, and farms in nearby villages, while other people commute to London and Portsmouth. Light industry tends to be concentrated on the Bedford Road estate on the west side of Petersfield, including Whitman Laboratories (part of Estée Lauder). In 2007 the Norwegian-owned oil-supply giant Aibel Ltd added an engineering office in addition to their UK head office in Petersfield.

Rubber products were manufactured in the town from 1919 to the 1980s, making parts for footwear, and in the 1930s sets of interlocking bricks as construction toys, marketed as Minibrix, pre-dating the plastic versions created by Lego.

<doc id="691074" wikidata="Q3007337" url="?curid=691074" title="Culture of Honduras">
<text>The wealth of cultural expression in Honduras owes its origins primarily to being a part of Latin America but also to the multi-ethnic nature of the country. The population comprises 80% Mestizo, 8% Amerindian, 2,9% Black, and 3% Caucasian. This influences all facets of the culture: customs, practices, ways of dressing, religion, rituals, codes of behavior and belief systems. 

==Popular culture==

Popular culture in Honduras, as in most countries, is expressed not so much through sophisticated artistic creations, but rather by popular events that draw big crowds. In Honduras, such artistic and cultural events are held on specific days of the year and through special celebrations. &quot;Punta&quot; is a kind of dance and music the Hondurans proudly gather to do.

Hondurans celebrate national holidays and special events in the form of carnivals, fairs and parades throughout the year. For instance, in La Ceiba the annual carnival is a week-long celebration with music, exhibitions and special food, culminating in the most popular carnival in the country: &quot;The Carnival of Friendship&quot;.

The &quot;Feria Juniana&quot; (June Fair) of San Pedro Sula includes musical concerts performed throughout the week, sporting events and exhibitions.

Puerto Cortés celebrates its fair in August with a &quot;Venice&quot; theme which includes parades of gondolas and other boats in the bay, and an evening fireworks display launched from boats.

Being a predominantly Catholic country, Honduras gives special attention to the celebrations of Holy Week. In some regions of the country, such as Comayagua, Choluteca, Copán and Intibucá, processions are held, especially during Thursday and Good Friday. Through these events, Hondurans commemorate the sacrifice Jesus Christ made for humanity by reenacting the events during the week between Palm Sunday and Jesus Christ crucifixion.

Probably the most outstanding event is the creation of the sawdust carpets. People will decorate the trail where Jesus will walk through (to his crucifixion) to make the walk less painful for Christ. Some people - particularly the inhabitants of the North and South Coast - use this week as an opportunity to visit beaches, rivers and swimming pools, to escape the stifling heat.

Hondurans celebrate Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Eve on 24 and 31 December respectively. During these celebrations, the majority of Honduran homes cook special dishes to mark the occasion. Favorites include &quot;tamales&quot; wrapped with banana leaves, roast pigs&#x27; legs, and pastries. All of these celebrations are complemented at the end of the night with fireworks and firecrackers.

Other celebrations of special interest to Hondurans include Mothers&#x27; Day, Children&#x27;s Day, Labor Day, Teachers&#x27; Day and Friendship Day.

==Ethnic cultures==
The predominant ethnic group in Honduras are the mestizo - people of mixed native and European (mostly Spanish) descent. Mestizos account for over 84% of the population of Honduras. There are several other minority ethnic groups. Amongst them are people who descend from native tribes that lived in the area before the Spanish arrived: Lencas, Chortís, Tolupanes, Pechs (also called Payas), Tawahkas, and Miskitos.

There is also a group called the Garífunas who descend from African slaves from the Caribbean islands.

According to the 2001 census the Amerindian population in Honduras included 381,495 people (6.3% of the total population). With the exception of the Lenca and the Ch&#x27;orti&#x27; they still keep their language.

Six different Amerindian groups were counted at the 2001 census:
* the Lenca (279,507 in 2001;4.6% of the total population) living in the La Paz, Intibucá, and Lempira departments;
* the Miskito (51,607 in 2001; 0.8%) living on the northeast coast along the border with Nicaragua.
* the Ch&#x27;orti&#x27; (34,453 in 2001;0.6% of the total population), a Mayan group living in the northwest on the border with Guatemala;
* the Tolupan (also called Jicaque, &quot;Xicaque&quot;, or Tol; 9,617 in 2001; 0.2% of the total population), living in the department of Yoro and in the reserve of the Montaña de la Flor and parts of the department of Yoro;
* the Pech or Paya Indians (3,848 in 2001; 0.1% of the total population) living in a small area in the Olancho department;
* the Sumo or Tawahka (2,463 in 2001; &lt;0.1%)

=== Lenca culture ===
The Lenca society forms the majority indigenous group, they gave resistance to the Spanish conquerors, who had to resort to various tactics and tricks to be able to subdue them. Chief Lempira, one of the Honduran heroes, was part of the Lencas tribe. His death at the hands of Rodrigo Ruiz, meant the final conquest of Honduran territory by the Spanish.
In the cultural part, the Lencas have lost their language and most of their religious practices, although they still practice peace pacts among themselves, as well as offerings to their ancestral gods, and some of them still retain their original way of dressing. Their food base comes from the sowing of basic grains, especially corn, from where they contributed culturally to Honduras the ‘Chicha’; in the artistic-economic plane the Lencas stand out for their pottery.

=== Garifuna culture ===

The Garífuna of Honduras come from the Lesser Antilles and more specifically from the island of San Vicente. From this place, the Garífunas were deported by the English in small boats, reaching the Bay Islands in 1797. This group of approximately 2000 Garífunas was later joined in the late 1800s and early 1900 by another considerable number of Garifuna immigrants with the purpose of alleviating the labor shortage in Honduras. Throughout its history, the Garífuna have settled on the Atlantic coast of Honduras, being the departments of Islas de la Bahía, Cortés, Atlántida and Colón where the largest number of Honduran Garífunas are concentrated.

This territory has allowed this group to depend on the marine resources provided by the northern coast of Honduras. Seafood, grains, fruits, and coastal legumes are part of the nutritional base of this ethnic group, among which are: Fish, bananas and yucca. From the latter they take the famous ‘casabe’, which is served almost daily in Garífuna households.

The Atlantic coast of Honduras also allows the Garífunas to preserve their Afro-Caribbean customs, among which are: Their Garífuna language, their religious system known as ‘Dugú’. Although it is to be noted that today, the majority have come to accept the Catholic religion. The most important cultural contribution of the Honduran Garífuna in the world is the dance &#x27;Punta&#x27; which reached high levels of popularity in the early 1900s after the musical success &#x27;Sopa de Caracol&#x27;, promoted by the group &#x27;Banda Blanca&#x27; from Honduras. At the sporting level, the Garífuna have excelled greatly, particularly in soccer. Many have been the members of this ethnic group, who have been part of the Honduras soccer team.

As of 2019, the National Autonomous University of Honduras celebrates the Garífuna National Interuniversity Cultural, Artistic and Academic Encounter annually.

Honduras has a variety of traditional dishes: The baleada is one of the most representative dishes of Honduran Gastronomy. It is basically composed; for a flour tortilla, which is folded and filled with fried beans, dry cheese and cream butter. Others add to it; roast meat or scrambled eggs to taste, sometimes avocado or chorizo is also added but with any of these ingredients it is very delicious. In addition to the baleadas, they are also popular: Roast beef with chimol, chicken in corn rice, fried fish with pickled onion, and the typical Garífuna dish that is fish fried in coconut oil. 

There is another very popular food called macheteada, which is a sugary flour dough frying with three slits, hence its name macheteados.

==Religion==
Honduras enjoys freedom of worship. Hondurans are predominantly Christians with half of the country being Catholic and has an increasing number of its population practicing different forms of evangelicalism. Before the conquest of Honduras in the national territory, each ethnic group had its own religion and its own gods, they were polytheistic and animistic religions, among them the Mayan Religion stands out, as well as the Chorotega Religion, the Lenca Religion and the Pech Religion.During colonial times, Christianity and some African religions such as the Garífuna Dugú religion were introduced to Honduras, which is a mixture of African, Christian (Catholic) and indigenous beliefs. Honduras was the country where the second Catholic Mass was celebrated in continental America. This was held on August 14, 1502, in Punta Caxinas, two weeks after the discovery of Honduras by Christopher Columbus. Since then, the Spanish were in charge of instilling the Christian faith among the natives of Honduras.

After the independence of Honduras in 1821 and in the first constitution of the country promulgated on December 11, 1825, Honduras is declared a secular state, this supposes the null interference of any organization or religious confession in the government of the same, either in the executive, the legislative or the judicial.

In recent years, both the Catholic Church and Protestant churches have experienced significant growth in terms of the number of committed parishioners and communicate with the new mass media, have television channels, radio stations, newspapers, schools, colleges, universities and Internet pages.

In addition to these religions, there are smaller-scale groups in Honduras that profess other religions, such as: Islam, Judaism, and members of the Rastafari movement among others.

Today a low percentage of the population is considered atheist, another low percentage of Hondurans consider themselves agnostic, 50% of the believers are Catholic and an important part of the autochthonous ethnic groups conserve their original religion.

Tribal and Indigenous Culture and Struggles within Honduras

There are several different tribes located in the country of Honduras known as the Lenca, Miskitu, Tawahka, Pech, Maya Chortis, Xicaques, and many more. Each tribe has its own history, cultural traditions, and livelihood within Honduras. These indigenous people fight environmental justice-related issues daily throughout their lives. Many indigenous people face the risk of eventually being forced to change their culture and historical practices within their own land to adopt the new modern-day culture of Honduras. Hence, there is growing popularity in the belief that indigenous people stand in the way of the country’s national development. 

The Lenca tribe, for example, is one of the largest in the country and has a population of around 100,000 and around 612 different Lenca communities. The majority of these communities are located in areas that are home to rough, mountainous terrain and are extremely difficult to reach. For those living in said conditions, essential daily tasks can be hard to complete in some locations as there is no roadway, running water, or even transportation. The Lenca tribe was unable to keep their language strong despite being somewhat isolated from the rest of the country. Income is made from selling coffee, weaving, and pottery; with their location, not a lot of money is made each day. The Lenca people have a true connection with the rivers, land, and nature. Non-indigenous people of Honduras pushed the Lenca people to live in the mountains, causing a lot of resistance between the two groups. 

Along with the remote living conditions, hydroelectric facilities and mining are becoming popular in Lenca’s territory. The Lenca are ready to fight, even if it means losing their lives and some already have. Young Lenca people face challenges such as finding employment as there is little way of making a consistent income within most locations that the Lenca tribe inhabits. Instead, they must leave and likely will find themselves working in the military. The Lenca tribe is striving to find any possible solution to these problems and wants young Lenca people to be able to stay within their communities. There are major injustices occurring within the Lenca’s people and land. With these injustices, a complex multitude of issues arise. These problems all tie together and include isolation, unemployment, loss of aspects of their culture such as their own native language and land, and mining/other environmental hazards. 

Hydroelectric, dams, and mining are all becoming very common in Honduras and tend to be located on tribal or indigenous lands. For instance, a damn was set to be constructed on the Gualcarque River. This river happened to be a very important and culturally significant river to the Lenca people and anyone surrounding that area. This dam’s main purpose would be to fuel hydroelectricity and mining for gold, silver, iron, and other valuable materials. A law was passed known generally as the “2013 mining law” that allowed open-pit mines and the use of harmful substances such as cyanide which is a threat to both the environment and human health. The law also required that the inhabitants of the land approve of the mining operations. However, the law often backfires and violent threats are used frequently as tactics to gain approval for the new construction of a mine or dam. Resistance often occurs with the Lenca tribe combined with other groups however it can become very dangerous even if the resistance is represented by means of a peaceful protest. The Honduran government has been present at these peaceful protests and often, violence such as shootings and other dangerous acts are at risk for breaking out. 

In 2009, the Honduran government underwent a military coup d&#x27;état. During this event, mass corruption occurred and individuals from marginalized groups such as those from Lenca and Garifuna tribes were restored to the streets. It has been an uphill battle for all in this position since then. Honduras still remains in a coup-like atmosphere with electoral frauds, increased deaths, a large migration of its people, activists being arrested and killed, and so on. Honduras has one of the highest murder rates of activists and these people face a massive amount of danger each day. The organization known as the Civil Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) plays a great role in activism towards these issues that the Lenca tribe and others face. Members of the COPINH group, such as Thomas Garcia, have been shot and killed during these protests against building dams and mining. The Miskitu tribe sums up around 5% of the indigenous population within the country of Honduras and is very large. 

Similar to the Lenca tribe, these people are often marginalized and do not have proper access to healthcare, or educational opportunities. Miskitu people are extremely hard workers which can cause them many health problems. In addition, agriculture, being part of nature and the land is a major part of their traditions and ways of living. These people often face problems that arise from the Honduran government forcing them from their land, thus making them cut ties with the agricultural roots and values of their own land. Over a period of many years, tropical rainforests along the Caribbean coast, home to much of the Miskitu tribe as well as others, have been experiencing issues with groups such as miners, ranchers, and other illegal groups and people wrongfully utilizing the tribal land. As of 2009, the Honduras government has finally handed over a large chunk of land to the Miskitu people however, a major plan to construct a dam known as the Patuca 3 hydroelectric project was funded in the main cultural lands of the Miskitu and other tribes. As soon as this land was handed over, the government also began pestering these tribes about potential gas and oil uses within the land. 

There are 41+ dam constructions which are all occurring in an area of tribal land. There have been several meetings between the tribes including the Tulupanes, Pech, Miskito, Maya-Chortis, Lenca, and Garifuna. The government of Honduras continues to jeopardize these tribal communities and utilize rivers that hold a huge link to the tribe&#x27;s traditions, culture, and roots. With such resistance between indigenous peoples and the government, there is a popular belief that indigenous people are against any further development of their land. When, in reality, indigenous people are open to changes and modifications within their land if the choice is made by their own people. This strong willed-attitude and belief are held as if the changes to the land occur as a decision made within the tribe then they will not lose connection with the land and can continue on with their way of life. All members of the tribes are ready to fight for the rights and title of their land if the construction of dams becomes an official plan. 

Despite many tribes such as Garifuna having a long history with their land and their presence in Honduras, their and other tribes&#x27; lands are sometimes deemed to be practically non-existent. Not only is their land within Honduras also experiencing issues with the construction of dams and or mining locations but also with recent tourism that is steadily increasing. With tourism becoming popular, the Garifuna face an increased risk of losing their land, as do many other tribes of Honduras. Some are promised employment within this new wave of tourism however, their culture is also becoming more visible to others, making it not as sacred. In addition, because of this increase in tourism, new developers have begun stomping the lands of the Garifuna and constructing upon their land (large resorts for tourists, etc), taking their land, and ripping their culture away from them. There are massive conflicts over the land being utilized in this way. 

In recent years, indigenous tribe members are still experiencing discrimination and a true lack of human rights toward their culture, land, and people. In 2016, 600+ activists gathered in the capital of Honduras known as Tegucigalpa. The event was known as the Summit for Indigenous and Peasant Communities in the Struggle Against Extractivism and was hosted by the Platform of Social and Popular Movement of Honduras. Struggles were shared by each tribe such as the problem of logging within the Tolupane tribes&#x27; land, extreme dam construction, and mining faced by the Lenca, members of the Garifuna tribe facing increased tourism and drilling within their lands, and so on. The groups combined in an effort to support one another and design resistance strategies together. Extraction methods are increasing rapidly and are often targeted to occur within indigenous people’s land instead of other prime locations. Activists are rising to promote these issues and improvements are being made but it will take a great deal of time to see them.

<doc id="691086" wikidata="Q15070179" url="?curid=691086" title="Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet">
<text>Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet (27 January 1603 – 2 January 1685) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1640 and 1685 and was Speaker in 1660. During the English Civil War he remained a Parliamentarian but was sympathetic to the Royalists.

==Life==

Grimston was born at Bradfield Hall, near Manningtree, the son of Sir Harbottle Grimston, 1st Baronet (d. 1648). He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and became a barrister of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He was recorder of Harwich and recorder of Colchester and elected MP for Harwich in 1628.

As member for Colchester, Grimston sat in the Short Parliament of 1640, and he represented the same borough during the Long Parliament, speedily becoming a leading member of the popular party. He attacked Archbishop Laud with great vigour and was a member of the important committees of the parliament, including the one appointed in consequence of the attempted seizure of the five members. He became deputy-lieutenant of Essex after the passing of the militia ordinance in January 1642.

Harbottle disliked taking up arms against the king, but remained nominally an adherent of the parliamentary party during the Civil War. In the words of Clarendon, he continued rather than concurred with them. Grimston does not appear to have taken the Solemn League and Covenant, but after the conclusion of the first period of the war he again became more active. He was president of the committee which investigated the escape of Charles from Hampton Court in 1647, and was one of those who negotiated with the king at Newport in 1648, when, according to Burnet, he fell upon his knees and urged the king to come to terms. Also in 1648 succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father as his elder brother had pre-deceased him.

From this time Grimston&#x27;s sympathies appear to have been with the Royalists. He was turned out of the House of Commons when the assembly was purged by Colonel Pride and was imprisoned. After he promised to do nothing detrimental to the parliament or the army, he was released and spent the next few years in retirement.

In 1656 Grimston was returned to the Second Protectorate Parliament as MP for Essex. However he was not allowed to take his seat, and with 97 others who were similarly treated he issued a remonstrance to the public.

Grimston was among the secluded members who re-entered the restored Rump Parliament in February 1660, was then a member of the council of state. He was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons in the Convention Parliament of 1660. As Speaker he visited Charles II at Breda, and addressed him in very flattering terms on his return to London; but he refused to accede to the King&#x27;s demand that he should dismiss Burnet from his position as chaplain to the Master of the Rolls, and in parliament he strongly denounced any relaxation of the laws against papists.

Grimston did not retain the office of Speaker after the dissolution of the Convention Parliament, but he was a member of the commission which tried the regicides, and in November 1660 he was appointed Master of the Rolls. Report says he paid Clarendon £8,000 for the office, while Burnet declares he obtained it without any application of his own. His friend and chaplain, Burnet, speaks very highly of his piety and impartiality, while not omitting the undoubted fact that he was much sharpened against popery.

In 1661, Harbottle was re-elected MP for Colchester in the Cavalier Parliament. He was re-elected in the two elections of 1679 and in 1681.

==Works==

Harbottle translated the law reports of his father-in-law, the judge Sir George Croke (1560–1642), which were written in Norman-French, and five editions of this work appeared. Seven of his parliamentary speeches were published, and he also wrote &quot;Strena Christiana&quot; (London, 1644, and other editions).

==Family==

Grimston&#x27;s first wife Mary, a daughter of Sir George Croke, bore him six sons and two daughters, He married secondly Anne Meautys, widow of Thomas Meautys and daughter of Sir Nathaniel Bacon, K.B., a grandson of Sir Nicholas Bacon and by her had one daughter.

His son George married Sarah (later fourth duchess of Somerset Seymour) but he died in 1655. Only one son, Samuel (1643–1700), survived his father, and when Samuel died in October 1700 the baronetcy became extinct. Sir Harbottle&#x27;s eldest daughter, Mary, married Sir Capel Luckyn, 2nd Baronet, and their grandson, William Luckyn, succeeded to the estates of his great-uncle, Sir Samuel Grimston, and took the name of Grimston in 1700. This William Luckyn Grimston (c. 1683–1756) was created Baron Dunboyne and Viscount Grimston in the peerage of Ireland in 1719. He was succeeded as 2nd viscount by his son James (1711–1773), whose son James Bucknall (1747–1808) was made an English peer as baron Verulam of Gorhambury in 1790. Then in 1815 his son James Walter Grimston (1775–1845), 2nd baron Verulam, was created Earl of Verulam. Sir Harbottle Grimston bought Sir Nicholas Bacon&#x27;s estate at Gorhambury, the residence of his descendants.

<text>Hugh Callingham Wheeler (19 March 1912 – 26 July 1987) was a British-American novelist, screenwriter, librettist, poet and translator. Born in London, he moved to the United States as a young man, and became a naturalized citizen in 1942. He had attended London University.

Under the nom de plume [[Patrick Quentin]], Q. Patrick and Jonathan Stagge, Wheeler was the author or co-author of many mystery novels and short stories. In 1963, his 1961 collection, &quot;The Ordeal of Mrs. Snow&quot; was given a Special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. He won the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical in 1973 and 1974 for his books for the musicals &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; and &quot;Candide&quot;, and won both again in 1979 for his book for &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;.

Wheeler is credited as &quot;research consultant&quot; for the film &quot;Cabaret&quot;, though numerous sources list him as co-writer of the screenplay.

A resident of Monterey, Massachusetts, Wheeler died from respiratory failure and heart failure at Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on 26 July 1987, aged 75.

<text>John Weidman (born September 25, 1946) is an American librettist and television writer for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. He has worked on stage musicals with Stephen Sondheim and Susan Stroman.

==Career==
Weidman was born in New York City and grew up in Westport, Connecticut, the son of Peggy Wright and librettist and novelist Jerome Weidman. He received a B.A. from Harvard University with a major in East Asian history and a J.D. from Yale Law School.

===Theatre===
Weidman collaborated on three stage musicals with Stephen Sondheim, all of which are politically themed to some degree. The first was &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;, about the Westernization of Japan in the 19th century; it premiered on Broadway in 1976 and was revived in 2004 at Studio 54. &quot;Assassins&quot;, a musical about the men and women who attempted (with or without success) to murder the President of the United States, first opened Off-Broadway in December 1990 at Playwrights Horizons, and later opened in the West End in October 1992 at the Donmar Warehouse. The musical was revived on Broadway in 2004 in a Roundabout Theater Company production. &quot;Road Show&quot;, a musical based on the lives of Wilson and Addison Mizner, opened Off-Broadway at the Public Theatre in 2008. The musical had productions at the Goodman Theatre and Kennedy Center in 2003 prior to the Off-Broadway production.

Weidman has worked with choreographer/director Susan Stroman three times. He wrote the book for the musical &quot;&quot;, with Stroman as choreographer. The musical opened on Broadway in April 1996 at the Shubert Theatre. He and Stroman co-created the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Contact&quot;, which opened Off-Broadway in October 1999 at the Newhouse Theatre at Lincoln Center and on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre in March 2000. He wrote the book for the new musical&quot; Happiness&quot;, which ran at Lincoln Center in February 2009. Directed and choreographed by Stroman, the composer was Scott Frankel with lyrics by Michael Korie.

He has been nominated for the Tony Award for Best Book for a Musical three times and has been inducted into The Theater Hall of Fame.

==Other work==
In the 1970s, Weidman wrote for &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. Weidman has also written for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, for which he and the writing team have won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing For A Children&#x27;s Series more than a dozen times.

<text>James Elliot Lapine (born January 10, 1949) is an American stage director, playwright, screenwriter, and librettist. He has won the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical three times, for &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, &quot;Falsettos&quot;, and &quot;Passion&quot;. He has frequently collaborated with Stephen Sondheim and William Finn.

==Early life==
Lapine was born on January 10, 1949, in Mansfield, Ohio, the son of Lillian (Feld) and David Sanford Lapine. He graduated from Franklin and Marshall College in 1971. Though he did not actively pursue theatre in childhood, Lapine did play Jack in an elementary school production of Jack and the Beanstalk. 

==Career==
Lapine studied photography and graphic design at the California Institute of the Arts, where he received an MFA in 1973. He was a photographer, graphic designer, and architectural preservationist, and taught design at the Yale School of Drama. At Yale University he wrote an adaptation of and directed Gertrude Stein&#x27;s &quot;Photograph&quot;, which was produced Off-Broadway at the Open Space in SoHo in 1977. He went on to write and direct Off-Broadway plays and musicals, directing composer William Finn&#x27;s &quot;March of the Falsettos&quot; in 1981; the musical won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Off-Broadway Play. Frank Rich, the &quot;New York Times&quot; theater critic, noted &quot;Mr. Lapine&#x27;s wildly resourceful staging&quot;.

In 1982, Lapine was introduced to Stephen Sondheim. The pair developed &quot;Sunday in the Park with George:&quot; Lapine wrote the book and directed; Sondheim created the music and lyrics. The play was first produced Off-Broadway in 1983, and moved to Broadway in 1984. Their next musical was &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 1987, for which Lapine won the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Best Book of a Musical. They next collaborated on the musical &quot;Passion&quot;, for which Lapine wrote the book and directed. The musical ran on Broadway in 1994 and in the West End in 1996, receiving a nomination for the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, and winning the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, among other awards and nominations. Their last collaboration was the revue &quot;Sondheim on Sondheim.&quot; Presented on Broadway in 2010, it won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical Revue.

In 1992, Lapine returned to working with William Finn, and wrote the book and directed the Broadway musical &quot;Falsettos&quot;. Lapine wrote the book and Finn composed the music for &quot;A New Brain&quot;, which premiered Off-Broadway in 1998. They later worked together on Finn&#x27;s musical &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot;, which premiered Off-Broadway in 2005 and later moved to Broadway. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote of the &quot;Spelling Bee&quot; Broadway transfer that &quot;Mr. Lapine has sharpened all the musical&#x27;s elements without betraying its appealing modesty.&quot; The latest Finn-Lapine work is &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;, which premiered in 2011 at the La Jolla Playhouse in California.

Lapine has also directed dramas, including &quot;Dirty Blonde&quot;, which ran Off-Broadway and then on Broadway in 2000. Conceived by Claudia Shear and Lapine and written by Shear with direction by Lapine, Ben Brantley called Lapine&#x27;s direction &quot;stylish and compassionate&quot;. Lapine was nominated for the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Best Direction of a Play.

Lapine directed the 2012 Broadway revival of &quot;Annie&quot;. He wrote a stage adaption of the Moss Hart autobiography &quot;Act One&quot;, which premiered on Broadway at the Lincoln Center Vivian Beaumont Theater in April 2014.

Lapine wrote the book for and directed the new musical &quot;Flying Over Sunset&quot;. A staged singing/reading was presented at the Vineyard Arts Project (Martha&#x27;s Vineyard) in August 2015. The composer is Tom Kitt and lyrics are by Michael Korie. The musical premiered on Broadway at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on November 11, 2021 in previews with the official opening scheduled for December 13. The production was originally scheduled to open on April 16, 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 1991, Lapine directed his first film, &quot;Impromptu&quot;, which has a screenplay by his wife, Sarah Kernochan. The story revolves around the romance of George Sand and Chopin, and stars Judy Davis and Hugh Grant. He followed with &quot;Life With Mikey,&quot; with Michael J. Fox for Disney. In 1993, he directed &quot;Passion&quot;, starring the original Broadway cast, for television. He directed the film version of Anne Tyler&#x27;s novel &quot;Earthly Possessions&quot;, starring Susan Sarandon and Stephen Dorff, for HBO in 1999. He wrote the screenplay for Disney&#x27;s film version of &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014), directed by Rob Marshall. He wrote and directed the film &quot;Custody&quot; in 2016 with Viola Davis, Hayden Panettiere, and Catalina Sandino Moreno.

Lapine received the 2015 Mr. Abbott Award at a special gala on October 19, 2015. The award is presented by the Stage Directors and Choreographers Foundation &quot;in recognition of a lifetime of exceptional achievement in the theatre.&quot; Lapine&#x27;s book &quot;Putting It Together: How Stephen Sondheim and I Created Sunday in the Park with George&quot; was released on August 3, 2021, and reviewed by Alan Cumming in a cover story in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; on August 8, 2021.

==Personal life==
Lapine is married to American screenwriter and director Sarah Kernochan. The couple&#x27;s daughter is food writer Phoebe Lapine. James Lapine&#x27;s niece, Sarna Lapine, directed the 2016 concert version and the 2017 Broadway revival of &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot;.

<text>George Furth (born George Schweinfurth; December 14, 1932 – August 11, 2008) was an American librettist, playwright, and actor.

==Life and career==
Furth was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of George and Evelyn (née Tuerk) Schweinfurth. He was of German and Irish ancestry, and was raised as a Christian Scientist. He received a bachelor of science in speech at Northwestern University in 1954 and received his master&#x27;s degree from Columbia University.

A life member of the Actors Studio, Furth made his Broadway debut as an actor in the 1961 play &quot;A Cook for Mr. General&quot;, followed by the musical &quot;Hot Spot&quot; two years later. He was also known for his collaborations with Stephen Sondheim: the highly successful &quot;Company&quot;, the ill-fated &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;, and the equally ill-fated drama &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;. Furth wrote the plays &quot;Twigs&quot;, &quot;The Supporting Cast&quot;, and &quot;Precious Sons&quot; as well as the book for the Kander and Ebb musical &quot;The Act&quot;.

One of Furth&#x27;s latter writing projects was a foray into an area where he had not previously explored. He wrote the lyrics for a musical revue, with music by Doug Katsaros. Furth and Katsaros shaped the work with San Francisco director Mike Ward into &quot;The End-a new musical revue&quot;. The piece was performed at San Francisco&#x27;s New Conservatory Theatre Center during the summer of 2004 and was billed as a &quot;Pre-U.S. Tour Workshop Production&quot;. The piece was reworked twice, with the title changing to &quot;Last Call&quot; and &quot;Happy Hour&quot;, respectively. 

Frequently cast as a bespectacled, ineffectual milquetoast, Furth appeared in &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (as a devoted railroad employee travelling in the car that contains the safe that Butch and his gang twice rob), &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot;, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, &quot;Shampoo&quot; (as a bank officer dealing with Warren Beatty’s character’s loan request), &quot;Oh, God!&quot; (as a newspaper editor who refuses to publicize John Denver’s character’s claims that God has communicated with him), &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot;, and &quot;Bulworth&quot;. His many television credits include &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot;; &quot;Tammy&quot;; &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;; &quot;Ironside&quot;; &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;; &quot;That Girl&quot;; &quot;Green Acres&quot;; &quot;The Monkees&quot;; &quot;Batman&quot;; &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;; &quot;Bonanza&quot;; &quot;Happy Days&quot;; &quot;All in the Family&quot;; &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;; &quot;L.A. Law&quot;; &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;Adam-12&quot;; &quot;F Troop&quot;; and the 1980 TV movie &quot;The Scarlett O&#x27;Hara War&quot;, in which he portrayed George Cukor. He was a regular in the cast of the short-lived 1976 sitcom &quot;The Dumplings&quot;.

He adapted his play &quot;Twigs&quot; as a 1975 television production, starring Carol Burnett. He also worked as a voice actor in several episodes of the animated television series &quot;The Adventures of Don Coyote and Sancho Panda&quot; for Hanna-Barbera Productions.

==Personal life and death==
Furth was gay. He and Stephen Sondheim both repeatedly refused to update &quot;Company&quot; to give it a gay slant.

Furth died at a hospital in Santa Monica, California, on August 11, 2008, at age 75.

==Awards==
Furth won both the Tony and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Book of a Musical for &quot;Company&quot; and was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Play for &quot;Precious Sons&quot;.

<doc id="691106" wikidata="Q280385" url="?curid=691106" title="Michael Bublé (album)">
<text>Michael Bublé is the third studio album by Canadian singer Michael Bublé. It was released on 143 Records and Reprise Records. The album was released on February 11, 2003 and was Bublé&#x27;s major label debut. It spawned four singles: &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;, &quot;Sway&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man Theme&quot;.

==Background==
Bublé&#x27;s career breakthrough came when he performed Kurt Weill&#x27;s classic track &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; at the wedding of Brian Mulroney&#x27;s daughter Caroline in September 2000. Mulroney introduced Bublé to David Foster, a multi-Grammy awarding producer and a Warner Bros. Records executive, who had previously worked with the likes of Josh Groban. Foster signed Bublé to his 143 record label, and he started recording the album in 2001, with David Foster as producer. The album features a range of standards from various eras including &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;, &quot;For Once in My Life&quot;, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Moondance&quot; and Lou Rawls&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine&quot;. Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees performs with Bublé on his version of the group&#x27;s classic track, &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;.

==Reception==

The album was released on February 11, 2003, to worldwide commercial success. The album peaked at No. 8 on the Canadian Albums Chart, as well as peaking at No. 1 in Australia and New Zealand, and achieving 2× platinum status, and No. 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also peaked at No. 6 in the United Kingdom, achieving platinum status. The album was eventually certified 4× platinum in Canada during 2006, 2× Platinum in the United Kingdom during 2007, and 7× Platinum in Australia during 2007. Bublé also won the &quot;Best New Talent&quot; award at the Juno Awards of 2004, and the album itself was nominated for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, only losing out to Sam Roberts.

==Singles==
&quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot;, a cover of the original by the Bee Gees, was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on February 4, 2003. The single was only released in the United States. It managed to reach the top thirty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart. No music video was released for the single.

&quot;Kissing a Fool&quot;, a cover of the original by George Michael, was released as the album&#x27;s second single on May 8, 2003, exclusively in the United States and Japan, also reaching the top thirty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; adult contemporary chart. No official music video was released for the single, despite strong radio airplay.

&quot;Sway&quot;, originally performed by Dean Martin, was released as the album&#x27;s third single on June 22, 2004. It also reached the top thirty of the adult contemporary chart, while a remix of the song by Junkie XL reached the top twenty in Australia in July 2004. &quot;Moondance&quot; was released alongside &quot;Sway&quot; in Australia.

&quot;Spider-Man Theme&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single in certain territories, appearing on a special edition of the album released in Italy and other select areas of Europe. The single was most successful in Italy, peaking at No. 2 on the Italian Singles Chart. A re-recorded version was featured in the end credits to &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.

<doc id="691148" wikidata="Q5632253" url="?curid=691148" title="HMS Echo (H87)">
<text>HMS &quot;Echo&quot; was the first of two multi-role hydrographic survey ships commissioned by the Royal Navy. With her sister ship, , they formed the of survey vessels. She was built by Appledore Shipbuilders in Devon in 2002 and was the ninth Royal Navy vessel to carry the name. She was retired from service in 2022.

==Design==
&quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; are the first Royal Navy ships to be fitted with azimuth thrusters. Both azimuth thrusters and the bow thruster can be controlled through the Integrated Navigation System by a joystick providing high manoeuvrability. Complete control and monitoring for power generation and propulsion, together with all auxiliary plant systems, tank gauging and damage control functions is provided through the integrated platform management system, accessible through workstations around the ship.

==Role==
&quot;Echo&quot; and her sister ship were designed to conduct survey operations in support of submarines or amphibious operations. She could provide almost real-time tailored environmental information, and also had a secondary role as a mine countermeasure tasking authority platform, for which she was capable of embarking a dedicated mine counter measures command team.

==Manning==
&quot;Echo&quot; operated a lean-manned three-watch rotation system. The total ship&#x27;s company is 72, with two-thirds of the ship&#x27;s company on board at any one time. The work cycle of 75 days on followed by 30 days off allowed her sailors to take sufficient leave whilst the ship remained away from her base port for extended periods, potentially for years at a time.

==Operational history==
&quot;Echo&quot; was launched on 2 March 2002 and was named on 4 March by Lady Haddacks, wife of Vice Admiral Sir Paul Haddacks. She was accepted into service on 4 October 2002 and formally commissioned on 7 March 2003.

===2002–2010===

&quot;Echo&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf to conduct survey operations in 2004, returning to the UK in April 2005.

Exploiting her rotational manning system, &quot;Echo&quot; was deployed on a five-year mission to the Far East, conducting ocean survey and diplomatic visits.

In August 2008 she visited Hong Kong, where her commanding officer laid a wreath at the Stanley Military Cemetery. In October of the same year she visited Busan for the Republic of Korea International Fleet Review. Other visits have been conducted to Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Indonesia.

===2011–2020===
February 2012 saw &quot;Echo&quot; visit the Seychelles to take part in anti-piracy training with the Seychelles Coast Guard. The visit included a stop in the capital Victoria. On 16 August 2012 the ship returned to Devonport after almost a year and a half away. In this time she had been in the Middle and Far East, and had fired on a suspected Somali pirate vessel.

In July 2013 &quot;Echo&quot; was in the central Mediterranean surveying the approaches to the ports of Tripoli and Khoms on the coast of Libya to improve Admiralty charts of the area. She was looking for wrecks that might be hazards to shipping. In ten days she found the wrecks of one ocean liner, two merchant ships, one landing craft, two fishing vessels, two barges and two large sunken pontoons. She also found at least half a dozen lost shipping containers. The landing craft is believed to be the Libyan Navy &quot;Ibn Qis&quot;, which was burnt out on exercise in 1978.

On 20 March 2014 &quot;Echo&quot; was in the Persian Gulf when redeployed to an area around south west of Perth, Western Australia, to join the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, in response to a request by the Australian authorities to the British Ministry of Defence. Prior to this, she was midway through an 18-month deployment &quot;to improve charts used by seafarers throughout the world&quot;. According to the ship&#x27;s programme, she was next to be conducting hydrographic surveying in the Gulf until her return to the UK later on in 2014.

As of January 2016, &quot;Echo&quot; was operating in UK waters on fishery protection duties while was deployed to the Caribbean. &quot;Echo&quot; departed Devonport on 4 November 2016 to relieve &quot;Enterprise&quot; on migrant patrol in the Mediterranean.

On 21 November 2018, the UK defence secretary announced &quot;Echo&quot; would deploy to the Black Sea in 2019 for a freedom of navigation manoeuvre in support of Ukraine. On 21 December, she was visited by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson in the port of Odesa.

===2021–2022===

In May 2022, &quot;Echo&quot; was reported to have been reduced to low readiness/reserve status.
&quot;Echo&quot; was decommissioned at Portsmouth Naval Base on 30 June 2022.

<text>HMS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the tenth ship to bear this name, was a multi-role survey vessel - hydrographic oceanographic (SVHO) of the Royal Navy along with that made up the &quot;Echo&quot; class of survey vessels.

==Design==
&quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; are the first Royal Navy ships to be fitted with azimuth thrusters. Both azimuth thrusters and the bow thruster can be controlled through the integrated navigation system by a joystick providing high manoeuvrability. Complete control and monitoring for power generation and propulsion, together with all auxiliary plant systems, tank gauging and damage control functions is provided through the integrated platform management system (IPMS), accessible through workstations around the ship.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; are designed to conduct survey operations in support of submarines or amphibious operations. She can provide almost real-time tailored environmental information, and also has a secondary role as a mine countermeasure tasking authority platform, for which she is capable of embarking a dedicated mine counter measures command team.

==Construction==
Built by Appledore Shipbuilders under the prime contractor Vosper Thornycroft, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was launched on 27 April 2002, officially named by the ship&#x27;s sponsor, Lady Sally Forbes, at her naming ceremony on 2 May 2002, and commissioned on 18 October 2003. She is designed and built to Lloyd&#x27;s Naval Ship Rules.

==Crewing==
&quot;Enterprise&quot;″s crew consists of 72 personnel, with 48 on board at any one time, working a cycle of 70 days on, 30 days off. The ship can accommodate 81 personnel if necessary. The ship was operationally available 330 days a year. In support of this high availability, all accommodation and recreational facilities are designed for an unusual (in a warship) degree of comfort. All personnel share double cabins with private facilities, except the captain and executive officer who both have single cabins.

==Operational history==

===2003–2010===

&quot;Enterprise&quot;″s first operational overseas deployment was to the Mediterranean in October 2004, returning to Devonport in April 2005. She participated in a NATO exercise and conducted oceanographic and hydrographic surveys.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; sailed in September 2005 to conduct survey operations in the Gulf of Aden and Somali Basin. She also conducted a collaborative hydrographic survey with the Saudi military.

In 2007 &quot;Enterprise&quot; deployed for 19 months to West Africa, South Africa, the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. While in the Persian Gulf she worked off the coast of Iraq in support of the UK and Iraqi governments.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; deployed in June 2009 for two years on an extended deployment to West Africa spending three months there before travelling through the Mediterranean to begin operations east of Suez later in the year.

===2011–2023===

On 10 June 2011, &quot;Enterprise&quot; returned to Devonport, having covered over during the deployment.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was dispatched to Libya in August 2014 to evacuate British citizens and diplomatic staff due to the increasing violence in the country. Over the course of two lifts, &quot;Enterprise&quot; evacuated a total of 217 civilians and landed them safely in Valletta, Malta.

In June 2015, &quot;Enterprise&quot; replaced in the mission to rescue migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy. By December 2015, &quot;Enterprise&quot; had been responsible for rescuing more than 2600 migrants. By December 2016, this number had risen to over 9000 before &quot;Enterprise&quot; was finally relieved by &quot;Echo&quot;. Among the migrants rescued by HMS Enterprise was Salman Abedi, the Libyan national who later went on to murder 22 people, including 7 children, at the Manchester Arena terrorist bombing on 22 May 2017. . In recognition of her contribution to the European Union&#x27;s Operation Sophia and her lifesaving work, the ship was awarded the Firmin Sword of Peace, an award given to units of the UK Armed Forces who have gone above and beyond their normal role.

<text>The Teahouse of the August Moon is a 1956 American comedy film directed by Daniel Mann and starring Marlon Brando. It satirizes the U.S. occupation and Americanization of the island of Okinawa following the end of World War II in 1945.

John Patrick adapted the screenplay from his own Pulitzer-Prize- and Tony Award-winning Broadway play of 1953. The play was, in turn, adapted from a 1951 novel by Vern J. Sneider. The film was entered into the 7th Berlin International Film Festival. The supporting cast features Glenn Ford, Machiko Kyō, Eddie Albert, Paul Ford and Harry Morgan.

==Plot==

Misfit Captain Fisby (Glenn Ford) is sent to Americanize the village of Tobiki on Okinawa, the largest of the Ryukyu Islands. His commanding officer, Colonel Wainwright Purdy III (Paul Ford), assigns him a wily local, Sakini (Marlon Brando), as interpreter.

Fisby tries to implement the military&#x27;s plans by encouraging the villagers to build a school in the shape of a pentagon, but they want to build a teahouse instead. Fisby gradually becomes assimilated to the local customs and mores with the help of Sakini and Lotus Blossom, a young geisha (Machiko Kyō).

To revive the economy, he has the Okinawans manufacture small items to sell as souvenirs, but nobody wants to buy them. These include cricket cages and wooden Japanese footwear called geta. Then Fisby makes a happy discovery. The villagers distill a potent sweet potato brandy in a matter of days which finds a ready market in the American army. With the influx of money, the teahouse is built in next to no time.

When Purdy sends psychiatrist Captain McLean (Eddie Albert) to check up on Fisby, the newcomer is quickly won over. This, even after Fisby greets McLean wearing geta, an army bathrobe (which Fisby claims is his kimono) and what Fisby terms an &quot;air-conditioned&quot; straw hat (the latter being headwear worn by Okinawan farmers). McLean later proves to be enthusiastic about organic farming.

When Purdy doesn&#x27;t hear from either officer, he shows up in person and surprises Fisby and McLean, the latter wearing a yukata (summer-weight kimono). They are leading a rowdy song at a party in full swing in the teahouse. Purdy orders the building and distillery destroyed. In a burst of foresight, the villagers break up old water urns rather than the brandy storage and only dismantle the teahouse, hiding the sections.

The village is chosen by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) as an example of successful American-led democratization. This leads to Colonel Purdy&#x27;s regretting his actions and to reassembling the teahouse.

==Cast==
* Marlon Brando as Sakini
* Glenn Ford as Captain Fisby
* Machiko Kyō as Lotus Blossom
* Eddie Albert as Captain McLean
* Paul Ford as Colonel Wainwright Purdy III
* Jun Negami as Mr. Seiko
* Nijiko Kiyokawa as Miss Higa Jiga
* Mitsuko Sawamura as Little Girl
* Henry (Harry) Morgan as Sergeant Gregovich

==Production==
Playing the role of an Okinawan villager was to prove an interesting challenge for Marlon Brando&#x27;s method acting techniques. He spent two months studying local culture, speech, and gestures and, for the actual shooting, spent two hours daily having make-up applied to make him appear Asian.

The role of Colonel Wainwright Purdy III was to have been played by Louis Calhern, but he died of a sudden heart attack in Nara early in production and was replaced by Paul Ford. Ford had played the part more than a thousand times on Broadway, having been an original cast member, and he would play a similarly bumbling, harassed colonel in Phil Silvers&#x27; TV series &quot;Bilko&quot;.

Ford was not the only actor who went on to be cast in a television series role very similar to his &quot;Teahouse&quot; character. Like the psychiatrist Captain McLean, Eddie Albert&#x27;s Oliver Wendell Douglas on &quot;Green Acres&quot; (1965-1971) was a licensed professional with an advanced degree, who obsessed about the glory of farming and yearned to give up his practice in favor of tending the soil.

The film made use of Japanese music recorded in Kyoto and sung and danced by Japanese artists. Machiko Kyō (Lotus Blossom) had won acclaim for her dramatic performances in &quot;Rashomon&quot; and &quot;Gate of Hell&quot;, so this lightly comedic part was a departure for her.

== Home media ==
In November 7, 2006, was released in DVD by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment as part of The Marlon Brando Collection along with &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; and &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot;. In November 20, 2018, was released in DVD, under the label Warner Archive Collection.

==Reception==
The picture was well received, both at the box-office and critically. The film was MGM&#x27;s biggest hit of the year, earning $5,550,000 in the US and Canada, and an additional $3,375,000 from a worldwide audience. The film made a profit of $1,507,000. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Motion Picture Promoting International Understanding&quot;.

==Legacy==
Alongside &quot;Japanese War Bride&quot; (1952) and another Brando film, &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957), &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; was argued by some scholars to have increased interracial tolerance in the United States by openly discussing interracial marriages. Other scholars have argued that the movie is one in a long list stereotyping Asian American women as &quot;lotus blossom, geisha girl, china doll, or Suzie Wong&quot; by presenting Asian women as &quot;passive, sexually compliant and easy to seduce&quot; or as downright prostitutes. The movie has been criticized by critical theorists and Brando&#x27;s performance branded as an example of yellowface casting.

A 1971 musical version of the play, &quot;Lovely Ladies, Kind Gentlemen&quot; ran only two weeks on Broadway, closing after 19 performances.

In 1980, Michael Medved awarded Marlon Brando&#x27;s performance a Golden Turkey Award for &quot;Most Ludicrous Racial Impersonation&quot;.

<doc id="691156" wikidata="Q2542754" url="?curid=691156" title="Marked Woman">
<text>Marked Woman is a 1937 American dramatic crime film directed by Lloyd Bacon and starring Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart, with featured performances by Lola Lane, Isabel Jewell, Rosalind Marquis, Mayo Methot, Jane Bryan, Eduardo Ciannelli and Allen Jenkins. Set in the underworld of Manhattan, &quot;Marked Woman&quot; tells the story of a woman who dares to stand up to one of the city&#x27;s most powerful gangsters.

The film was a major success for Warner Bros. and one of Davis&#x27; most important early pictures. She had recently filed a lawsuit against the studio, partly because of the inferior quality of roles that she was expected to play. Although she lost the lawsuit, she garnered considerable press coverage, and &quot;Marked Woman&quot; was her first film upon returning to Hollywood. She was reported to be pleased with the script and the dramatic possibilities that it afforded her. Jack L. Warner was said to be equally pleased by the public&#x27;s reaction in favor of Davis, which he predicted would increase the appeal and profitability of her films.

Costars Humphrey Bogart and Mayo Methot met on the set of &quot;Marked Woman&quot; and were married in 1938.

==Plot==
The notorious underworld czar Johnny Vanning becomes the owner of a gaudy New York night club and renames it Club Intimate. He exploits and mistreats the club&#x27;s bar girls—Mary, Gabby, Emmy Lou, Florrie, and Estelle—in order to ensure their loyalty and obedience. As part of her job, Mary entices a man into betting and losing more money than he can afford. On the way home, he confides in her that he does not have the money to repay the gambling debt. He feels that it is all a game, but Mary warns him that he is in real danger and must leave town immediately. She is distressed, but not surprised, to learn soon after that the man has been murdered by two of Vanning&#x27;s henchmen. District Attorney David Graham brings Vanning to trial, feeling that he has a strong case. Mary testifies against them, but Vanning has an airtight alibi concocted for them, and further damages her reputation, so the jury rules they were innocent. Graham believes that Mary lied to him, and she leaves fearing Vanning&#x27;s retribution.

Mary&#x27;s younger sister Betty visits for a football game. Unaware of the dangerous situation that she has entered, Betty attends a party at Vanning&#x27;s club with Mary&#x27;s roommate Emmy Lou. She meets Vanning&#x27;s friend Bob Crandall, and after dancing with him, returns to the women&#x27;s apartment. Mary admonishes her to not to go back to the party, but Betty does it anyway. At the party Betty meets Crandall again, and he tries to get her to go with him. She resists, but Vanning is enraged and slaps her, causing her to tumble down a flight of stairs to her death. Vanning disposes of her corpse in the river.

Mary is panicked that Betty hasn&#x27;t returned from the party, and threatens to testify against Vanning, but his thugs beat her and scar her face, cutting a cross onto her cheek. Her resolve to testify against Vanning is only strengthened. Aware that they can only be free from Vanning if they stand against him, the other women also agree to testify. They implicate Vanning, breaking up his vice ring. As Graham is congratulated by the press, the five girls walk off into the foggy night.

; Cast notes
* Eduardo Ciannelli bears a physical resemblance to Lucky Luciano.
* Hymie Marks, who played the bit part of a gangster named Joe in the film, attracted the attention of executive producer Hal B. Wallis, who felt that he did not look menacing enough, despite the fact that Marks was a former gangster and henchman of Lucky Luciano and had been specifically cast by director Lloyd Bacon because of this connection.
* Warner Bros. had originally cast Jane Wyman as Florrie.

==Background==
Despite a disclaimer at the start of the film that asserts that the story is fictitious, &quot;Marked Woman&quot; is loosely based on the real-life crime-fighting exploits of Thomas E. Dewey, a Manhattan district attorney who became a national celebrity in the 1930s because of his fight against organized crime in New York City. Dewey indicted and convicted several prominent gangsters, and his greatest achievement was the conviction of Lucky Luciano, the organized crime boss of the entire city. Dewey used the testimony of numerous call girls and madams to convict Luciano of running one of the largest prostitution rings in American history. Hollywood studios produced several films about Dewey&#x27;s exploits, with &quot;Marked Woman&quot; among the most prominent. Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s character David Graham is based on Dewey, who went on to twice become the Republican presidential nominee in the 1940s.

Warner Bros. purchased the rights from a &quot;Liberty&quot; series on Luciano but was forced to make alterations to the story because of censorship concerns, such as changing the women&#x27;s profession from that of prostitute to nightclub hostess.

==Production==
Because the Motion Picture Production Code prohibited plots involving brothels or prostitution, the prostitutes in the original &quot;Liberty&quot; series were changed to nightclub hostesses in the screenplay. Vanning&#x27;s racket became illegal gambling rather than running a prostitution ring, and the crime became a murder.

&quot;Marked Woman&quot; entered production on December 9, 1936 at the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank under the working title &quot;The Men Behind&quot;. Director Michael Curtiz substituted for Lloyd Bacon while Bacon was on his honeymoon.

Bette Davis was unhappy with the minimal bandaging that had been used for her hospital-room scene, so on her lunch break she drove to her personal doctor, described the injuries from the script and asked him bandage her accordingly. When she returned to the studio, a guard at the gate saw her bandages and called executive producer Hal B. Wallis to tell him that Davis had been in an accident.

Warner Bros. rereleased &quot;Marked Woman&quot; in 1947.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;Night and Day&quot; in 1937, Graham Greene offered a positive review, noting that as a noir film &quot;it&#x27;s been done before, of course, [...] but it has never been done better than in some of these scenes.&quot; Greene praised Ciannelli, who was able to &quot;convey not only corruption but the sadness of corruption,&quot; but Green expressed disappointment with Davis&#x27; acting, which he claimed &quot;plugs the emotions with dreadful abandonment.&quot;

The film is ranked on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes at 100% based on reviews by five critics and with an average ranking of 6.5/10.

===Awards and honors===
Bette Davis won the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Volpi Cup for Best Actress in 1937. Director Lloyd Bacon was nominated for the 1937 Mussolini Cup.
