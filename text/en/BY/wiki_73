<text>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) is a book (1969, updated 1999) by California psychiatrist David Reuben. It was one of the first sex manuals that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s, and had a profound effect on sex education and in liberalizing attitudes towards sex. It was &quot;among the top 20 all-time best sellers of the 20th century in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/best-seller&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The book was a Number 1 best-seller in 51 countries and reached more than 100 million readers. In 1972, it was parodied by Woody Allen in the comedy film of the same name and received a favorable response from movie critics.

The book had a significant impact. It was favorably reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, and, after a massive book tour, would go on to be #1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 55 weeks. Reuben became a celebrity, guesting, a dozen times, on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Johnny Carson.

As popular as the book was, it attracted critics in both the clinical world, and the public. The LGBT community objected to negative descriptions of homosexuality in the book (for example, Reuben wrote that gay men were &quot;trying to solve the problem with only half the pieces&quot;; lesbianism was relegated to a brief discussion in a section about prostitution). It was negatively reviewed, with &quot;anti-Semitic overtones&quot;, by Gore Vidal, in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, for its homophobia. In 1972, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine published an article purporting to expose 100 errors in the book.

Reuben wrote an updated version (&quot;he says he has altered &quot;96 percent&quot; of his first edition&quot;) which was published 30 years later, in 1999 and 2000. In particular, his views on homosexuality, abortion, and pornography were updated. Andrew Tobias reviewed the book, in 1999, for &quot;The Advocate&quot;. It was reviewed by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, the Chicago Tribune, and others.

==Meme==
Its curiosity-arousing title and its question-and-answer format has inspired hundreds of similarly titled and formatted research papers.

<text>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of long-term kidney disease, in which either there is a gradual loss of kidney function which occurs over a period of months to years, or an abnormal kidney structure (with normal function). Initially, patients are usually asymptomatic, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the renin–angiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization. CKD can lead to end-stage kidney failure requiring kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation.

Causes of chronic kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease. Risk factors include a family history of chronic kidney disease. Diagnosis is by blood tests to measure the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and a urine test to measure albumin. Ultrasound or kidney biopsy may be performed to determine the underlying cause. Several severity-based staging systems are in use.
Screening at-risk people is recommended. Initial treatments may include medications to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are generally first-line agents for blood pressure control, as they slow progression of the kidney disease and the risk of heart disease. Loop diuretics may be used to control edema and, if needed, to further lower blood pressure. NSAIDs should be avoided. Other recommended measures include staying active, and &quot;to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and a lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods.&quot; Plant-based diets are feasible and are associated with improved intermediate outcomes and biomarkers. An example of a general, healthy diet, suitable for people with CKD who do not require restrictions, is the Canada Food Guide Diet. People with CKD who require dietary restrictions or who have other specific nutritional problems should be referred to a dietitian. Treatments for anemia and bone disease may also be required. Severe disease requires hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or a kidney transplant for survival.
Chronic kidney disease affected 753 million people globally in 2016 (417 million females and 336 million males.) In 2015, it caused 1.2 million deaths, up from 409,000 in 1990. The causes that contribute to the greatest number of deaths are high blood pressure at 550,000, followed by diabetes at 418,000, and glomerulonephritis at 238,000.

==Signs and symptoms==
CKD is initially without symptoms and is usually detected on routine screening blood work by either an increase in serum creatinine, or protein in the urine. As the kidney function decreases, more unpleasant symptoms may emerge:
* Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and the production of vasoactive hormones created by the kidney via the renin-angiotensin system, increasing the risk of developing hypertension and heart failure. People with CKD are more likely than the general population to develop atherosclerosis with consequent cardiovascular disease, an effect that may be at least partly mediated by uremic toxins. People with both CKD and cardiovascular disease have significantly worse prognoses than those with only cardiovascular disease.
* Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Due to its high systemic concentration, urea is excreted in eccrine sweat at high concentrations and crystallizes on the skin as the sweat evaporates (&quot;uremic frost&quot;).
* Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias). Hyperkalemia usually does not develop until the glomerular filtration rate falls to less than 20–25 mL/min/1.73 m2, when the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium. Hyperkalemia in CKD can be exacerbated by acidemia (triggering the cells to release potassium into the bloodstream to neutralize the acid) and from lack of insulin.
* Fluid overload symptoms may range from mild edema to life-threatening pulmonary edema.
* Hyperphosphatemia results from poor phosphate elimination in the kidney, and contributes to increased cardiovascular risk by causing vascular calcification. Circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) increase progressively as the kidney capacity for phosphate excretion declines, which may contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased mortality in people with CKD .
* Hypocalcemia results from 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 deficiency (caused by high FGF-23 and reduced kidney mass) and the skeletal resistance to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone. Osteocytes are responsible for the increased production of FGF-23, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase (responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol into 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3). Later, this progresses to secondary hyperparathyroidism, kidney osteodystrophy, and vascular calcification that further impairs cardiac function. An extreme consequence is the occurrence of the rare condition named calciphylaxis.
* Changes in mineral and bone metabolism that may cause 1) abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus (phosphate), parathyroid hormone, or vitamin D metabolism; 2) abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, volume, linear growth, or strength (kidney osteodystrophy); and 3) vascular or other soft-tissue calcification. CKD–mineral and bone disorders have been associated with poor outcomes.
* Metabolic acidosis may result from decreased capacity to generate enough ammonia from the cells of the proximal tubule. Acidemia affects the function of enzymes and increases the excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by the promotion of hyperkalemia.
* Anemia is common and is especially prevalent in those requiring hemodialysis. It is multifactorial in cause but includes increased inflammation, reduction in erythropoietin, and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression. Hypoproliferative anemia occurs due to inadequate production of erythropoietin by the kidneys.
* In later stages, cachexia may develop, leading to unintentional weight loss, muscle wasting, weakness, and anorexia.
* Cognitive decline in patients experiencing CKD is an emerging symptom revealed in research literature. Research suggests that patients with CKD face a 35–40% higher likelihood of cognitive decline and or dementia. This relation is dependent on the severity of CKD in each patient; although emerging literature indicates that patients at all stages of CKD will have a higher risk of developing these cognitive issues.
* Sexual dysfunction is very common in both men and women with CKD. A majority of men have a reduced sex drive, difficulty obtaining an erection, and reaching orgasm, and the problems get worse with age. Most women have trouble with sexual arousal, and painful menstruation and problems with performing and enjoying sex are common.

==Causes==
The most common causes of CKD are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis. About one of five adults with hypertension and one of three adults with diabetes have CKD. If the cause is unknown, it is called &quot;idiopathic&quot;.

===By anatomical location===
* Vascular disease includes large-vessel disease such as bilateral kidney artery stenosis and small-vessel disease such as ischemic nephropathy, hemolytic–uremic syndrome, and vasculitis.
* Glomerular disease comprises a diverse group and is classified into:
** Primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy (or nephritis)
** Secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis
* Tubulointerstitial disease includes drug- and toxin-induced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and reflux nephropathy
* Obstructive nephropathy, as exemplified by bilateral kidney stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia of the prostate gland; rarely, pinworms infecting the kidney can cause obstructive nephropathy.

===Other===
* Genetic congenital disease such as polycystic kidney disease or 17q12 microdeletion syndrome.
* Mesoamerican nephropathy, is &quot;a new form of kidney disease that could be called agricultural nephropathy&quot;. A high and so-far unexplained number of new cases of CKD, referred to as the Mesoamerican nephropathy, has been noted among male workers in Central America, mainly in sugarcane fields in the lowlands of El Salvador and Nicaragua. Heat stress from long hours of piece-rate work at high average temperatures of about 36 °C (96 °F) is suspected, as are agricultural chemicals
* Chronic lead exposure

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of CKD is largely based on history, examination, and urine dipstick combined with the measurement of the serum creatinine level. Differentiating CKD from acute kidney injury (AKI) is important because AKI can be reversible. One diagnostic clue that helps differentiate CKD from AKI is a gradual rise in serum creatinine (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine (several days to weeks). In many people with CKD, previous kidney disease or other underlying diseases are already known. A significant number present with CKD of unknown cause.

===Screening===
Screening those who have neither symptoms nor risk factors for CKD is not recommended. Those who should be screened include: those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged &gt; 60 years, subjects with African American ancestry, those with a history of kidney disease in the past, and subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis.

Screening should include calculation of the estimated GFR (eGFR) from the serum creatinine level, and measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a first-morning urine specimen (this reflects the amount of a protein called albumin in the urine), as well as a urine dipstick screen for hematuria.

The GFR is derived from the serum creatinine and is proportional to 1/creatinine, i.e. it is a reciprocal relationship; the higher the creatinine, the lower the GFR. It reflects one aspect of kidney function, how efficiently the glomeruli – the filtering units – work. The normal GFR is &gt;90 ml/min. The units of creatinine vary from country to country, but since the glomeruli comprise &lt;5% of the mass of the kidney, the GFR does not indicate all aspects of kidney health and function. This can be done by combining the GFR level with the clinical assessment of the person, including fluid status, and measuring the levels of hemoglobin, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone.

===Ultrasound===
Kidney ultrasonography is useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in chronic kidney disease. Whether the underlying pathologic change is glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, or inflammation, the result is often increased echogenicity of the cortex. The echogenicity of the kidney should be related to the echogenicity of the liver or the spleen. Moreover, decreased kidney size and cortical thinning are often seen especially when the disease progresses. However, kidney size correlates to height, and short persons tend to have small kidneys; thus, kidney size as the only parameter is unreliable.
===Additional imaging===
Additional tests may include nuclear medicine MAG3 scan to confirm blood flow and establish the differential function between the two kidneys. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans are also used in kidney imaging; with both MAG3 and DMSA being used chelated with the radioactive element technetium-99.

===Stages===
A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is considered normal without chronic kidney disease if there is no kidney damage present.

Kidney damage is defined as signs of damage seen in blood, urine, or imaging studies which include lab albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30. All people with a GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 3 months are defined as having chronic kidney disease.

Protein in the urine is regarded as an independent marker for the worsening of kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Hence, British guidelines append the letter &quot;P&quot; to the stage of chronic kidney disease if protein loss is significant.
# Stage 1: Slightly diminished function; kidney damage with normal or relatively high GFR (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and persistent albuminuria. Kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies.
# Stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60–89 mL/min/1.73 m2) with kidney damage. Kidney damage is defined as pathological abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies.
# Stage 3: Moderate reduction in GFR (30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2):. British guidelines distinguish between stage 3A (GFR 45–59) and stage 3B (GFR 30–44) for purposes of screening and referral.
# Stage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15–29 mL/min/1.73 m2) Preparation for kidney replacement therapy.
# Stage 5: Established kidney failure (GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m2), permanent kidney replacement therapy, or end-stage kidney disease.

The term &quot;non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease&quot; (NDD-CKD) is a designation used to encompass the status of those persons with an established CKD who do not yet require the life-supporting treatments for kidney failure known as kidney replacement therapy (RRT, including maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation). The condition of individuals with CKD, who require either of the two types of kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant), is referred to as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Hence, the start of the ESKD is practically the conclusion of the NDD-CKD. Even though the NDD-CKD status refers to the status of persons with earlier stages of CKD (stages 1 to 4), people with advanced stages of CKD (stage 5), who have not yet started kidney replacement therapy, are also referred to as NDD-CKD.

==Management==
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious condition often linked to diabetes and high blood pressure. There is no cure, but a combination of lifestyle changes and medications can help slow its progression. This might include a plant-dominant diet with less protein and salt, medications to control blood pressure and sugar, and potentially newer anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors may also focus on managing heart disease risk, preventing infections, and avoiding further kidney damage. While dialysis may eventually be needed, a gradual transition can help preserve remaining kidney function. More research is ongoing to improve CKD management and patient outcomes.

===Blood pressure===
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are recommended as first-line agents since they have been found to slow the decline of kidney function, relative to a more rapid decline in those not on one of these agents. They have also been found to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death from cardiovascular disease when compared to placebo in individuals with CKD. ACEIs may be superior to ARBs for protection against progression to kidney failure and death from any cause in those with CKD. Aggressive blood pressure lowering decreases people&#x27;s risk of death.

===Other measures===
* Aggressive treatment of high blood lipids is recommended.
* A low-protein, low-salt diet may result in slower progression of CKD and reduction in proteinuria as well as controlling symptoms of advanced CKD to delay dialysis start. A tailored low-protein diet, designed for low acidity, may help prevent damage to kidneys for people with CKD. Additionally, controlling salt ingestion helps to decrease the incidence of coronary heart disease, lowering blood pressure and reducing albuminuria.
* Anemia – A target hemoglobin level of 100–120 g/L is recommended; raising hemoglobin levels to the normal range has not been found to be of benefit.
** Guidelines recommend treatment with parenteral iron prior to treatment with erythropoietin.
** Replacement of erythropoietin is often necessary in people with advanced disease.
** It is unclear if androgens improve anemia.
* Calcitriol is recommended for vitamin D deficiency and control of metabolic bone disease.
* Phosphate binders are used to control the serum phosphate levels, which are usually elevated in advanced chronic kidney disease.
* Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and zinc may improve sexual dysfunction in men.

=== Lifestyle interventions ===

==== Weight loss ====
Obesity may have a negative impact in CKD, increasing the risk of disease progression to ESKD or kidney failure compared to controls with healthy weight, and when in advanced stages also may hinder people&#x27;s eligibility to kidney transplantation. For example, the consumption of high calorie and high fructose beverages can make an individual &quot;60% more likely to develop CKD&quot;.

Weight management interventions in overweight and obese adults with CKD include lifestyle interventions (dietary changes, physical activity/exercise, or behavioural strategies), pharmacological (used to reduce absorption or suppress appetite) and surgical interventions. Any of these can help people with CKD lose weight, however, it is not known if they can also prevent death or cardiovascular events like heart complications or stroke. It is recommended that weight management interventions should be individualised, according to a thorough patients&#x27; assessment regarding clinical condition, motivations, and preferences.

==== Dietary salt intake ====
High dietary sodium intake may increase the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The effect of dietary restriction of salt in foods has been investigated in people with chronic kidney disease. For people with CKD, including those on dialysis, reduced salt intake may help to lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as albuminuria. Some people may experience low blood pressure and associated symptoms, such as dizziness, with lower salt intake. The effect of salt restriction on extracellular fluid, oedema, and total body weight reduction is unknown.

EHealth interventions may improve dietary sodium intake and fluid management for people with CKD.

==== Omega-3 supplementation ====
In people with CKD who require hemodialysis, there is a risk that vascular blockage due to clotting, may prevent dialysis therapy from being possible. Even though Omega-3 fatty acids contribute to the production of eicosanoid molecules that reduce clotting, it does not have any impact on the prevention of vascular blockage in people with CKD.

==== Protein supplementation ====
Regular consumption of oral protein-based nutritional supplements may increase serum albumin levels slightly in people with CKD, especially among those requiring hemodialysis or who are malnourished. Prealbumin level and mid-arm muscle circumference may also be increased following supplementation. Despite possible improvement in these indicators of nutritional status, it is not certain that protein supplements affect the quality of life, life expectancy, inflammation, or body composition.

==== Iron supplementation ====
Intravenous (IV) iron therapy may help more than oral iron supplements in reaching target hemoglobin levels. However, allergic reactions may also be more likely following IV-iron therapy.

=== Sleep ===
Individuals with CKD have an increased prevalence of sleep apnea compared to the general population (both OSA and central sleep apnea). The presence of sleep apnea in CKD has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. 

People with CKD also experience sleep disorders, thus unable to get quality sleep. There are several strategies that could help, such as relaxation techniques, exercise, and medication. Exercise may be helpful with sleep regulation and may decrease fatigue and depression in people with CKD. However, none of these options have been proven to be effective in the treatment of sleep disorders. This means that it is unknown what is the best guidance to improve sleep quality in this population.

===Referral to a nephrologist===
Guidelines for referral to a nephrologist vary between countries. Most agree that nephrology referral is required by Stage 4 CKD (when eGFR/1.73m2 is less than 30 mL/min; or decreasing by more than 3 mL/min/year).

It may also be useful at an earlier stage (e.g. CKD3) when urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is more than 30 mg/mmol, when blood pressure is difficult to control, or when hematuria or other findings suggest either a primarily glomerular disorder or secondary disease amenable to a specific treatment. Other benefits of early nephrology referral include proper education regarding options for kidney replacement therapy as well as pre-emptive transplantation, and timely workup and placement of an arteriovenous fistula in those people with chronic kidney disease opting for future hemodialysis.

===Renal replacement therapy===
At stage 5 CKD, kidney replacement therapy is usually required, in the form of either dialysis or a kidney transplant.

In CKD numerous uremic toxins accumulate in the blood. Even when ESKD (largely synonymous with CKD5) is treated with dialysis, the toxin levels do not go back to normal as dialysis is not that efficient. Similarly, after a kidney transplant, the levels may not go back to normal as the transplanted kidney may not work 100%. If it does, the creatinine level is often normal. The toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights, and some of them are bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Uremic toxins are classified into three groups as small water-soluble solutes, middle molecular-weight solutes, and protein-bound solutes. Hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membrane, long or frequent treatment, and increased blood/dialysate flow has improved removal of water-soluble small molecular weight uremic toxins. Middle molecular weight molecules are removed more effectively with hemodialysis using a high-flux membrane, hemodiafiltration, and hemofiltration. However, conventional dialysis treatment is limited in its ability to remove protein-bound uremic toxins.

==Prognosis==
CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, and people with CKD often have other risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood lipids. The most common cause of death in people with CKD is cardiovascular disease rather than kidney failure.

Chronic kidney disease results in worse all-cause mortality (the overall death rate) which increases as kidney function decreases. The leading cause of death in chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease, regardless of whether there is progression to stage 5.

While kidney replacement therapies can maintain people indefinitely and prolong life, the quality of life is negatively affected. Kidney transplantation increases the survival of people with stage 5 CKD when compared to other options; however, it is associated with an increased short-term mortality due to complications of the surgery. Transplantation aside, high-intensity home hemodialysis appears to be associated with improved survival and a greater quality of life, when compared to the conventional three-times-a-week hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

People with ESKD are at increased overall risk for cancer. This risk is particularly high in younger people and gradually diminishes with age. Medical specialty professional organizations recommend that physicians do not perform routine cancer screening in people with limited life expectancies due to ESKD because the evidence does not show that such tests lead to improved outcomes.

In children, growth failure is a common complication of CKD. Children with CKD will be shorter than 97% of children the same age and sex. This can be treated with additional nutritional support or medication such as growth hormone.

=== Survival without dialysis ===
Survival rates of CKD are generally longer with dialysis than without (having only conservative kidney management). However, from the age of 80 and in elderly patients with comorbidities there is no difference in survival between the two groups. Quality of life might be better for people without dialysis.

People who had decided against dialysis treatment when reaching end-stage chronic kidney disease could survive several years and experience improvements in their mental well-being in addition to sustained physical well-being and overall quality of life until late in their illness course. However, use of acute care services in these cases is common, and the intensity of end-of-life care is highly variable among people opting out of dialysis.

==Epidemiology==
About one in ten people have chronic kidney disease. In Canada 1.9 to 2.3 million people were estimated to have CKD in 2008. CKD affected an estimated 16.8% of U.S. adults aged 20 years and older in the period from 1999 to 2004. In 2007 8.8% of the population of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had symptomatic CKD.

Chronic kidney disease was the cause of 956,000 deaths globally in 2013, up from 409,000 deaths in 1990.

=== Chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology ===

The cause of chronic kidney disease is sometimes unknown; it is referred to as chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu). a rapidly progressive chronic kidney disease, unexplained by diabetes and hypertension, had increased dramatically in prevalence over a few decades in several regions in Central America and Mexico, a CKDu referred to as the Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN). It was estimated in 2013 that at least 20,000 men had died prematurely, some in their 20s and 30s; a figure of 40,000 per year was estimated in 2020. In some affected areas CKD mortality was five times the national rate. MeN primarily affects men working as sugarcane labourers. The cause is unknown, but in 2020 the science found a clearer connection between heavy labour in high temperatures and incidence of CKDu; improvements such as regular access to water, rest and shade, can significantly decrease the potential CKDu incidence. CKDu also affects people in Sri Lanka where it is the eighth largest cause of in-hospital mortality.

===Race===
African, Hispanic, and South Asian (particularly those from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India) populations are at high risk of developing CKD. Africans are at greater risk due to the number of people affected with hypertension among them. As an example, 37% of ESKD cases in African Americans can be attributed to high blood pressure, compared with 19% among Caucasians. Treatment efficacy also differs between racial groups. Administration of antihypertensive drugs generally halts disease progression in white populations but has little effect in slowing kidney disease among black people, and additional treatment such as bicarbonate therapy is often required. While lower socioeconomic status contributes to the number of people affected with CKD, differences in the number of people affected by CKD are still evident between Africans and Whites when controlling for environmental factors.

Although CKD of unknown etiology was first documented among sugar cane workers in Costa Rica in the 1970s, it may well have affected plantation laborers since the introduction of sugar cane farming to the Caribbean in the 1600s. In colonial times the death records of slaves on sugar plantations were much higher than for slaves forced into other labor.

==== Denial of care ====
Denial of care in chronic kidney disease treatment and management is a significant issue for minority populations. This can be due to healthcare provider prejudice, structural barriers, and health insurance coverage disparities. Healthcare provider biases can lead to under-treatment, misdiagnosis, or delayed diagnosis. Structural barriers, such as lack of insurance and limited healthcare facilities, hinder access to timely care. Furthermore, health insurance coverage disparities, with minority populations lacking adequate coverage, contribute to these disparities. Denial of care worsens health outcomes and perpetuates existing health inequities.

==== Race-based kidney function metric ====
Race-based kidney function metrics, particularly normalizing creatinine, pose ethical challenges in diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). While certain racial and ethnic groups are at higher risk, using race as a reference range may reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate health disparities. This approach fails to account for the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social factors influencing kidney function. Depending solely on race-based metrics may lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis in minority populations. Alternative approaches that consider socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, and genetic vulnerability, are needed to accurately assess kidney function and address CKD care disparities.

It was said to be costing the National Health Service about £1.5 billion a year in 2020.

Kidney Care UK and The UK National Kidney Federation represent people with chronic kidney disease. The Renal Association represents Kidney physicians and works closely with the National Service Framework for kidney disease.

==== Australia ====
Kidney Health Australia serves that country.

==Other animals==

=== Dogs ===
The incidence rate of CKD in dogs was 15.8 cases per 10,000 dog years at risk. The mortality rate of CKD was 9.7 deaths per 10,000 dog years at risk. (Rates developed from a population of 600,000 insured Swedish dogs; one dog year at risk is one dog at risk for one year). The breeds with the highest rates were the Bernese mountain dog, miniature schnauzer, and boxer. The Swedish elkhound, Siberian husky and Finnish spitz were the breeds with the lowest rates.

=== Cats ===

Cats with chronic kidney disease may have a buildup of waste products usually removed by the kidneys. They may appear lethargic, unkempt, and lose weight, and may have hypertension. The disease can prevent appropriate concentration of urine, causing cats to urinate in greater volumes and drink more water to compensate. Loss of important proteins and vitamins through urine may cause abnormal metabolism and loss of appetite. The buildup of acids within the blood can result in acidosis, which can lead to anemia (which can sometimes be indicated by pink or whitish gums, but by no means does the presence of normal colored gums guarantee that anemia is not present or developing), and lethargy.

==Research==
 several compounds are in development for the treatment of CKD. These include the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) olmesartan medoxomil; and sulodexide, a mixture of low molecular weight heparin and dermatan sulfate.

<text>NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship refers to one of three championships in men&#x27;s field lacrosse contested by the NCAA since 1971 to determine the top team in the NCAA Division I, Division II, and Division III.

*NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship
*NCAA Division II Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship
*NCAA Division III Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship

This tournament has determined the national champion since the inaugural 1971 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship. Prior to this, from 1936 through 1970, the executive board of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) selected the annual winners of the Wingate Memorial Trophy as national champions based on season records.

The NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship, with the semi-finals and finals played in National Football League stadiums, is among the most attended NCAA Championships.

<doc id="714470" wikidata="Q6806607" url="?curid=714470" title="Medical tattoo">
<text>A medical tattoo is a tattoo used to treat a condition, communicate medical information, or mark a body location for treatment. People may get a paramedical tattoo to conceal a condition or the effects of treatment, such as creating the appearance of an areola after breast reconstruction, or a cover-up tattoo to disguise the area in an artistic way.

== Historical uses ==
Ötzi, a man who lived between 3350 and 3105 BC and whose remains were found near the Austria–Italy border, had tattoos over his joints that may have been part of pain relief treatments similar to acupuncture.

A crude practice of corneal tattooing was performed by the Greek physician Galen in 150 CE. He tried to cover leucomatous opacities of the cornea by cauterizing the surface with a heated stilet and applying powdered nutgalls and iron or pulverized pomegranate bark mixed with copper salt. With the rise of Christianity, tattooing declined and eventually became banned by a papal edict in 787 CE.

In 1835, a German doctor named Pauli used mercury sulfide and white lead to tattoo over skin lesions including nevi and purple plaque. Another doctor in the 1850s used mercury sulfide after plastic surgery of the lip. The practice of corneal tattooing was revived by Louis de Wecker in the 1870s. Tattooing of scarred lips with cinnabar began in 1911.

== To provide medical information ==
During the Cold War, threats of nuclear warfare led several U.S. states to consider blood type tattooing. Programs were spurred in Chicago, Utah and Indiana based on the premise that if an atomic bomb were to strike, the resulting damage would require extremely large amounts of blood within a short amount of time.

Similar to dog tags, members of the U.S. military may have their vital information tattooed on themselves, usually on the rib cage below the armpit; they are referred to as &quot;meat tags&quot;.

Tattoos have also been used to provide notice to emergency personnel that a person has diabetes mellitus; people with this condition may fall into a diabetic coma and be unable to communicate that information. Medical alert jewelry, such as bracelets, are the most common way to provide this notice, but some people prefer tattoos due to the cost and inconvenience of losing or breaking jewelry. Because diabetes can impair wound healing, people with diabetes may need to carefully choose the location and timing of a medical tattoo.

== For radiation treatment ==
Tattoos have been used as fiducial markers as an aid in guiding radiotherapy. Typically these markers are tattooed in dark permanent ink, but ultraviolet tattoos, which are mostly invisible under normal light, have been studied as an alternative to minimize impact on patient body image. Scott Kelly used marker tattoos in the positioning of sonogram probes for multiple checks for atherosclerosis while on a long-duration mission on the International Space Station.

== Paramedical tattoos ==

A paramedical tattoo is a cosmetic tattoo applied to conceal a medical condition or to disguise the results of its treatment, typically in a realistic style. Alternatively, people with skin conditions or scars may choose to get a decorative cover-up tattoo with a piece of art over the area.

During breast reconstruction after mastectomy (removal of the breast for treatment of cancer), or breast reduction surgery, tattooing is sometimes used to replace the areola which has been removed during mastectomy, or to fill in areas of pigment loss which may occur during breast reduction performed with a free nipple graft technique. Since September 2011, the Royal Derby Hospital offers free nipple tattoos for breast surgery patients in order to mask the scars of surgery. The purchase of the tattoo device was funded by the Ashbourne Breast Cancer Walk. Vinnie Myers of Little Vinnie&#x27;s Tattoos in Finksburg, Maryland, has performed nipple tattoos on over 5,000 women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer, including those of Caitlin Kiernan, who wrote a story about Myers in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. A similar service offered without charge in 2017 by a cosmetic tattooist in the UK was booked up six months ahead. Another option some people choose after mastectomy is to get a decorative tattoo on the chest as body art instead of a reconstruction.

Other uses include simulating the appearance of fingernails and covering scars. Micropigmentation (permanent makeup) can be used to reduce the visibility of vitiligo areas on the skin.

Eyebrow enhancement tattoos such as microblading can provide benefits for individuals with medical conditions like alopecia or trichotillomania, providing a natural-looking restoration of eyebrows lost due to these conditions.

<doc id="714475" wikidata="Q733668" url="?curid=714475" title="Ghassanids">
<text>The Ghassanids, also known as the Jafnids, were an Arab tribe. Originally from South Arabia, they migrated to the Levant in the 3rd century and established what would eventually become a Christian kingdom under the aegis of the Byzantine Empire. However, some of the Ghassanids may have already adhered to Christianity before they emigrated from South Arabia to escape religious persecution.

As a Byzantine vassal, the Ghassanids participated in the Byzantine–Sasanian Wars, fighting against the Sasanian-allied Lakhmids, who were also an Arabian tribe, but adhered to the non-Chalcedonian Church of the East. The lands of the Ghassanids also acted as a buffer zone protecting lands that had been annexed by the Romans against raids by Bedouins.

After just over 400 years of existence, the Ghassanid kingdom fell to the Rashidun Caliphate during the Muslim conquest of the Levant. A few of the tribe&#x27;s members then converted to Islam, while most dispersed themselves amongst Melkites and Syriacs in what is now Jordan, Israel, Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon.

==Establishment==

=== Genealogy and emigration from South Arabia ===
In the Arab genealogical tradition, which developed during the early Islamic period, the Ghassanids were considered a branch of the Azd tribe of South Arabia. In this genealogical scheme, their ancestor was Jafna, a son of Amr Muzayqiya ibn Amir ibn Haritha ibn Imru’ al Qais ibn Tha’labah ibn Mazin ibn Azd, through whom the Ghassanids were purportedly linked with the Ansar (the Aws and Khazraj tribes of Medina), who were the descendants of Jafna&#x27;s brother Tha&#x27;laba. According to the historian Brian Ulrich, the links between Ghassan, the Ansar, and the wider Azd are historically tenuous, as these groups are almost always counted separately from each other in sources other than post-8th-century genealogical works and the story of the &#x27;Scattering of Azd&#x27;. In the latter story, the Azd migrate northward from South Arabia and different groups of the tribe split off in different directions, with the Ghassan being one such group.

=== Settlement in the Roman frontier ===
Per the &quot;Scattering of Azd&quot; story, the Ghassanids eventually settled within the Roman &quot;limes&quot;. The tradition of Ghassanid migration finds support in the &quot;Geography&quot; of Ptolemy, which locates a tribe called the Kassanitai south of the Kinaidokolpitai and the river Baitios (probably the wadi Baysh). These are probably the people called Casani in Pliny the Elder, Gasandoi in Diodorus Siculus and Kasandreis in Photios I of Constantinople (relying on older sources). The date of the migration to the Levant is unclear, but they are believed to have first arrived in the region of Syria between 250 and 300, with later waves of migration circa 400. Their earliest appearance in records is dated to 473, when their chief, Amorkesos, signed a treaty with the Byzantine Empire acknowledging their status as &quot;foederati&quot; controlling parts of Palestine. He apparently became a Chalcedonian Christian at this time. By the year 510, the Ghassanids were no longer Miaphysites, but Chalcedonian.

==Byzantine period==
The &quot;Assanite Saracen&quot; chief Podosaces that fought alongside the Sasanians during Julian&#x27;s Persian expedition in 363 might have been a Ghassanid.

After originally settling in the Levant, the Ghassanids became a client state to the Byzantine Empire. The Romans found a powerful ally in the Ghassanids who acted as a buffer zone against the Lakhmids. In addition, as kings of their own people, they were also phylarchs, native rulers of client frontier states. The capital was at Jabiyah in the Golan Heights. Geographically, it occupied much of the eastern Levant, and its authority extended via tribal alliances with other Azdi tribes all the way to the northern Hijaz as far south as Yathrib (Medina).

===Byzantine–Sasanian Wars===
The Ghassanids fought alongside the Byzantine Empire against the Persian Sasanians and Arab Lakhmids. The lands of the Ghassanids also continually acted as a buffer zone, protecting Byzantine lands against raids by Bedouin tribes. Among their Arab allies were the Banu Judham and Banu Amilah.

The Byzantines were focused more on the East and a long war with the Sasanians was always their main concern. The Ghassanids maintained their rule as the guardian of trade routes, policed Lakhmid tribes and was a source of troops for the imperial army. The Ghassanid king al-Harith ibn Jabalah (reigned 529–569) supported the Byzantines against the Sasanians and was given in 529 by the emperor Justinian I, the highest imperial title that was ever bestowed upon a foreign ruler; also the status of patricians. In addition to that, al-Harith ibn Jabalah was given the rule over all the Arab allies of the Byzantine Empire. Al-Harith was a Miaphysite Christian; he helped to revive the Syrian Miaphysite (Jacobite) Church and supported Miaphysite development despite Orthodox Byzantium regarding it as heretical. Later Byzantine mistrust and persecution of such religious unorthodoxy brought down his successors, Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith (reigned 569–582).

The Ghassanids, who had successfully opposed the Lakhmids of al-Hirah in Lower Mesopotamia, prospered economically and engaged in much religious and public building; they also patronized the arts and at one time entertained the Arab poets al-Nabighah and Hassan ibn Thabit at their courts.

==Early Islamic period==
===Rashidun conquest of the Levant===
The nascent Muslim state in Medina, first under the Islamic prophet Muhammad (d. 632) and lastly under the second caliph, Umar (), made abortive attempts to contact or win over the Ghassan of Syria. The last phylarch of the Ghassan, Jabala ibn al-Ayham, stories of whom are shrouded in legend, led his tribesmen and those of Byzantium&#x27;s other allied Arab tribes in the Byzantine army that was routed by the Muslims at the Battle of Yarmouk in . After supposedly embracing Islam, Jabala left the faith and ultimately withdrew with his tribesmen from Syria to Byzantine-held Anatolia in 639, by which time the Muslims had conquered most of Byzantine Syria. Unable to make headway with the Ghassan, the Muslim administration in Syria under its governor Mu&#x27;awiya succeeded in allying with the Ghassan&#x27;s old-established Syrian allies, the Banu Kalb. The latter became the cornerstone of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s military power in Syria, and later, when he became head of the Syria-based Umayyad Caliphate in 661, of the Islamic empire in general.

===Umayyad and Abbasid periods===
Significant remnants of the Ghassan remained in Syria, residing in Damascus and the city&#x27;s Ghouta countryside. At least nominally and probably gradually, many of these Ghassanids embraced Islam, especially under Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s rule. According to the historian Nancy Khalek, they consequently became an &quot;indispensable&quot; group of Muslim society in early Islamic Syria. Mu&#x27;awiya actively sought the militarily and administratively experienced Syrian Christians, including the Ghassanids, and members of the tribe served him and later Umayyad caliphs as governors, commanders of the &quot;shurta&quot; (select troops), scribes, and chamberlains. Several descendants of the tribe&#x27;s Tha&#x27;laba and Imru al-Qays branches are listed in the sources as Umayyad court poets, jurists, and officials in the eastern provinces of Khurasan, Adharbayjan and Armenia.

When Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s grandson, Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya II, died without a chosen successor amid the Second Muslim Civil War in 684, Umayyad rule was on the verge of collapse in Syria, having already collapsed throughout the caliphate, where the supporters of a rival caliph, the Mecca-based Ibn al-Zubayr, took charge. The Ghassan, along with their tribal allies in Syria, especially the Kalb, supported continued Umayyad rule to secure their interests under the dynasty, and nominated Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s distant cousin, Marwan I, as caliph during a summit of the Syrian tribes in the old Ghassanid capital of Jabiyah. Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, the governor of Damascus, meanwhile, threw his backing behind Ibn al-Zubayr. During the Battle of Marj Rahit, which pitted Marwan against Dahhak in a meadow north of Damascus, the scion of the Ghassanid family in Damascus, Yazid ibn Abi al-Nims, led a revolt there and secured control of the city for Marwan, who routed Dahhak and assumed office. In a poem attributed to him, Marwan lauds the Ghassan, as well as the Kalb, Kinda, and Tanukh of Syria, for supporting him.

The above tribes thereafter formed the Yaman faction, in opposition to the Qays tribes which backed Dahhak and Ibn al-Zubayr. The Qays–Yaman rivalry contributed to the downfall of Umayyad rule, with each faction supporting different Umayyad dynasts and governors in what became the Third Muslim Civil War. The Ghassanid Shabib ibn Abi Malik was a leader of the Yaman in Damascus and conspired to assassinate the pro-Qaysi Caliph al-Walid II (). After the latter was killed, the Ghassan marched on Damascus to help install his successor, the Yamani-backed Yazid III (). The toppling of the Umayyads and the advent of the Iraq-based Abbasid Caliphate in 750 &quot;was disastrous for the power, wealth and status of the Arab tribes in Syria&quot;, including the Ghassan, according to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy. By the 9th century, the tribe had adopted a settled life, being recorded by the geographer al-Ya&#x27;qubi (d. 890) to be living in the Ghouta gardens region of Damascus and in Gharandal in Transjordan.

===Scholarly families in Damascus===
Two Damascene Ghassanid families in particular achieved prominence in early Islamic Syria, those of Yahya ibn Yahya al-Ghassani (d. 750s) and Abu Mushir al-Ghassani (d. 833). The former was the son of Caliph Marwan&#x27;s head of the &quot;shurta&quot;, Yahya ibn Qays. Upon returning to Damascus after his stint as a governor of Mosul for the Umayyad caliph Umar II (), Yahya ibn Yahya took up scholarship and became known as the &quot;sayyid ahl Dimashq&quot; (leader of the people of Damascus), transmitting purported hadiths (traditions and utterances) of Muhammad, which he derived from his uncle Sulayman, who received the transmissions from Muhammad&#x27;s Damascus-based companion, Abu Darda. Among some traditions sourced to Yahya ibn Yahya by later Muslim scholars are those regarding the discovery of John the Baptist&#x27;s head in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus and others which praise the mosque&#x27;s splendor and the Umayyad dynasty in general. Yahya ibn Yahya&#x27;s sons, grandsons, great-grandsons and great-great-grandsons continued their ancestor&#x27;s interests in hadith scholarship and remained part of the Damascene elite into the mid-9th century.

Abu Mushir&#x27;s grandfather, Abd al-A&#x27;la, was a hadith scholar and Abu Mushir studied under the famous Syrian scholar Sa&#x27;id ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Tanukhi. He became a prominent hadith scholar in Damascus, with special interest in the administrative history of Syria, its local elite&#x27;s genealogies and local scholars. During the Fourth Muslim Civil War between the Abbasid dynasts, an Umayyad, Abu al-Umaytir al-Sufyani, took power in Syria in 811, in a bid to reestablish the Umayyad Caliphate. Abu Mushir, whose grandfather was killed by the Abbasids in 750, disdained the Iraqis represented by the Abbasids and supported the restoration of Umayyad rule. He served as Abu al-Umaytir&#x27;s qadi (chief jurist), but was imprisoned by the Abbasids in the years following the rebellion&#x27;s suppression in 813. His great-grandsons Abd al-Rabb ibn Muhammad and Amr ibn Abd al-A&#x27;la also attained fame as Damascene scholars.

==Kings==
Medieval Arabic authors used the term Jafnids for the Ghassanids, a term modern scholars prefer at least for the ruling stratum of Ghassanid society. Earlier kings are traditional, actual dates highly uncertain.

==Legacy==
The Ghassanids reached their peak under al-Harith V and al-Mundhir III. Both were militarily successful allies of the Byzantines, especially against their enemies the Lakhmids, and secured Byzantium&#x27;s southern flank and its political and commercial interests in Arabia proper. On the other hand, the Ghassanids remained fervently dedicated to Miaphysitism, which brought about their break with Byzantium and Mundhir&#x27;s own downfall and exile, which was followed after 586 by the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation. The Ghassanids&#x27; patronage of the Miaphysite Syrian Church was crucial for its survival and revival, and even its spread, through missionary activities, south into Arabia. According to the historian Warwick Ball, the Ghassanids&#x27; promotion of a simpler and more rigidly monotheistic form of Christianity in a specifically Arab context can be said to have anticipated Islam. Ghassanid rule also brought a period of considerable prosperity for the Arabs on the eastern fringes of Syria, as evidenced by a spread of urbanization and the sponsorship of several churches, monasteries and other buildings. The surviving descriptions of the Ghassanid courts impart an image of luxury and an active cultural life, with patronage of the arts, music and especially Arab-language poetry. In the words of Ball, &quot;the Ghassanid courts were the most important centres for Arabic poetry before the rise of the Caliphal courts under Islam&quot;, and their court culture, including their penchant for desert palaces like Qasr ibn Wardan, provided the model for the Umayyad caliphs and their court.

After the fall of the first kingdom in the 7th century, several dynasties, both Christian and Muslim, ruled claiming to be a continuation of the House of Ghassan. Besides the claim of the Phocid or Nikephorian Dynasty of the Byzantine Empire being related. The Rasulid Sultans ruled from the 13th until the 15th century in Yemen, while the Burji Mamluk Sultans did likewise in Egypt from the 14th to the 16th centuries.

The last rulers to claim the titles of Royal Ghassanid successors were the Christian Sheikhs Al-Chemor in Mount Lebanon ruling the small sovereign principality of Akoura (from 1211 until 1641) and Zgharta-Zwaiya (from 1643 until 1747) from Lebanon.

<text>Posten, the Swedish mail service, was established in 1636 by Axel Oxenstierna, and by the 18th century it had been extended throughout the country.

== 19th century ==
Sweden issued its first postage stamps on 1 July 1855, a set of five values denominated in skilling banco. These stamps depicted the coat of arms, were inscribed &quot;SVERIGE&quot;, as have been all subsequent Swedish stamps, and were perforated. A printing error resulted in the Treskilling Yellow, a unique stamp that is currently the highest-priced in the world. The currency changed to öre and riksdaler on 1 July 1858, necessitating a new issue of stamps; the design was the same as before, but the stamps slightly smaller.

A new design that included a reclining lion appeared in 1862, but it was used only for 3 öre, 17 öre, and 20 öre values before being superseded in 1872 by a design featuring a large numeral in a round frame. The numeral issue included Sweden&#x27;s first bi-colored stamp; the 1-riksdaler value was printed in bistre and blue, and the center design was the Three Crowns of the royal arms. The numerals continued in use for nearly twenty years, the main change being the replacement of the riksdaler stamp with a 1-kronor value in 1878 (five years after the introduction of krona).

The monarch made a first appearance on stamps in 1885, in the person of Oscar II, who was depicted in profile on a 10 öre value. The following year the practice began of printing a posthorn on the back of each stamp, underneath the gum. In 1889 a shortage of 10 öre values necessitated the surcharge of 12 öre and 24 öre numerals.

In 1891 a new definitive series featured bi-colored numerals for low values and a profile of Oscar II for the 5 öre and up. On 26 October 1903, Sweden&#x27;s first commemorative stamp came out; a 5-kronor value depicting the Stockholm Post Office on the occasion of its opening.

== 20th century ==
A new series of 1910 used an arms design for low values, and a full-face portrait of King Gustav V. Additional surcharges were needed in 1918 before new stamps of the series could be printed. 1920 saw the introduction of coil stamps using a lion design and a new portrait of Gustav, along with a crown and posthorn design for larger denominations, as well as a commemorative depicting Gustavus Adolphus and marking the 300th anniversary of a precursor mail route that ran from Stockholm to Hamburg.
These and subsequent Swedish issues were usually issued in both booklet (or sheet) and coil form.

During the 1920s, the 1920 definitives were gradually supplanted by a new series with a 3/4 profile of Gustav. In 1924, the Universal Postal Union celebrated its 50th anniversary and its Congress was held in Stockholm, so Sweden issued two series marking it, the first with a view of the Stockholm skyline, and the second with two designs; a postrider watching an airplane, and a carrier pigeon over a globe. Both sets were primarily aimed at collectors, but are nevertheless prized today.

Another major commemorative set in 1936 marked the 300th anniversary of the postal service with 12 values each with its own design noting some aspect of Sweden&#x27;s postal history to date.

In 1939 a new series used a profile of Gustav for lower values, and the Three Crowns for higher; the crowns design continued in use into the 1960s. Meanwhile, the pattern for commemoratives was to issue about 3–4 each year, typically a single design in two denominations, with the lower value available in both booklet and coil form, and the higher as a coil stamp only.

Gustaf VI Adolf appeared in profile from 1951 on.

Czesław Słania began doing engraving for the post in 1959, and so became well known for work of exceptional quality.

The definitives of 1967 were a major departure from tradition. Instead of portraits of the king, the 18 designs encompassed a wide variety of subjects, including wildlife, scenery, daily life, history, and legend, each realized in radically different styles.

<doc id="714482" wikidata="Q16154448" url="?curid=714482" title="NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament">
<text>The NCAA Division II women&#x27;s basketball tournament (officially styled as &quot;Championship&quot; instead of &quot;Tournament&quot;) is an annual tournament to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II women&#x27;s college basketball national champion.

Basketball was one of 12 women&#x27;s sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981–82 school year, as the NCAA and Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) sought for sole governance of women&#x27;s collegiate athletics. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championships; however, after a year of dual women&#x27;s championships at the national level, the AIAW disbanded.

The 2020 Elite Eight was due to be held at the Birmingham CrossPlex in Birmingham, AL before the NCAA called off the tournament due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The field was reduced to 48 in 2021 and returned to the normal 64 in 2022.

Minnesota State are the defending national champions.

== Qualification ==
A total of 64 bids are normally available for each tournament: 23 automatic bids (awarded to the champion of each Division II all-sports conference) and 41 at-large bids. Due to COVID-19 issues, the 2020 tournament was canceled, and the 2021 tournament was reduced to 48 teams when nine all-sports conferences chose not to compete in women&#x27;s basketball in 2020–21.

The bids are allocated evenly among the eight NCAA-designated regions (Atlantic, Central, East, Midwest, South, South Central, Southeast, and West), each of which contains either two or three of the 23 Division II conferences that sponsor women&#x27;s basketball. Each region normally consists of two or three automatic qualifiers (the teams who won their respective conference tournaments) and five or six at-large bids (awarded regardless of conference affiliation).

<doc id="714489" wikidata="Q38000" url="?curid=714489" title="Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen">
<text>The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen or GBGV is a dog breed from France.

==History==
The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen is derived from the Grand Griffon. The first selections were made at the end of the 19th century by the Comte d&#x27;Elva who was looking for subjects with &quot;straight legs&quot;. But it was Paul Dézamy who was especially responsible for fixing the type. He had understood that in order to catch a hare, dogs of a certain size were needed. He fixed the size at about 43 cm. Today used primarily when hunting with a gun, it is capable of hunting all mammalian game, from the rabbit to the wild boar. A team of Grand Bassets won the fifth edition of the European Cup for hare. The GBGV is one of six types of &quot;basset&quot;-type breeds recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). 

==Description==
===Appearance===
Grand Basset Griffon Vendéens a long-backed, short-legged hunting breed of dog of the hound type, originating in the Vendée region of France. They are still used today to hunt boar, deer, and to track rabbit and hare, but are more commonly kept as a domestic pet.

===Temperament===
They are pack dogs, so owners should either spend a lot of time with them or get a second dog or a cat. They have a happy and confident personality, which can sometimes manifest itself as disobedience. With obedience training and patience, they can make great companions. 

==Health==

===Longevity===
Average longevity of 76 deceased Basset Griffon Vendéens (varieties combined) in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey was 12.1 years (maximum 17.3 years). Leading causes of death were cancer (33%), old age (24%), and cardiac (7%).

Compared to surveyed longevities of other breeds of similar size, Basset Griffon Vendéens have a typical or somewhat higher than average life expectancy.

Among 289 live Basset Griffon Vendéens (varieties combined) in the 2004 UKC survey, the most common health issues noted by owners were reproductive, dermatologic (dermatitis and mites), and aural (otitis externa, excessive ear wax, and ear mites).

<doc id="714495" wikidata="Q3052521" url="?curid=714495" title="Honorverse">
<text>The Honorverse is a military science fiction book series, its two subseries, two prequel series, and anthologies created by David Weber and published by Baen Books. They are centered on the space navy career of the principal protagonist Honor Harrington. The books have made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

The series began with &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot; in 1992.

==Plot==
The series follows Honor Harrington, military heroine and later, influential politician, during a time of extreme interstellar change and tension. Most of the more than 20 novels and anthology collections cover events between 4000 and 4022 AD with &quot;PD&quot; (Post-Diaspora) dating beginning with a dispersal to the stars from our sun (&quot;Sol&quot;) in 2103 AD. The main series novels are set primarily in a timeline beginning 40 years after Harrington&#x27;s birth on October 1, 3962 AD (1859 PD), and some short stories flesh out her earlier career. Additional novels and shorter fiction take place up to 350 years earlier, and still-earlier canon history is filled in between narratives and in appendices attached to the main novels and anthologies.

The political makeup and history of the series frequently echoes actual history, particularly that of Europe in the last half of the second millennium. The series is consciously modeled on the Horatio Hornblower series by C. S. Forester, and its main character, like Horatio Hornblower, on a mix of Thomas Cochrane and Admiral Lord Nelson. Weber originally planned for Harrington to die in the fifth book. This was later changed to parallel Nelson by having her die at the peak of her career in the climactic Battle of Manticore in 1921 PD (4024 AD), then continue the series with her children as the main protagonists. However, collaborating author Eric Flint intervened, asking for the invention of a mutual enemy for both the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Republic of Haven to oppose in a spy-and-counterspy spin-off sub-series the two contractually agreed to co-write, just as they have contracts to write in Flint&#x27;s 1632 universe. This &quot;rethink&quot; and redesign caused Weber to move the series&#x27; internal chronology up by about 20 years and begat the &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot; novel, first in the &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot; sub-series based on a number of the short stories of the first four collections. In this scenario, proxies for Manticore and Haven oppose the same hidden enemy, the genetic slavers and powers behind the government and corporations of the planet of Mesa. Mesa is later revealed in &quot;Mission of Honor&quot; to be part of a secret cabal of about a dozen highly capable planets that are busily building a secret navy using advanced technologies at a secret planet and known to itself as the Mesan Alignment. The Mesan Alignment&#x27;s navy has new technology and conducts a sneak attack on Manticore in 1922 PD during the twelfth mainline novel, &quot;Mission of Honor&quot;. The Mesans have a 600-year-old secret program to reinstitute purposeful genetic engineering of humans and break up the Solarian League, while taking down all opponents opposing such genetic engineering. This makes the staunchly anti-genetic-slavery star nations of Haven, Manticore, and various associates of the planet Beowulf primary targets of the Mesan Alignment. The &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot; sub-series books and last two mainline Honorverse novels detail the rising extent of this threat.

As the two sub-series progress, albeit with somewhat-separate casts of characters, each is expected by Weber to carry the detailed storyline events particular to their astrographical region forward and tie together into an ongoing plotline concerning the massive and monolithic Solarian League, which foreshadowing in the most recent novels suggests is about to undergo severe disruption. The thirteenth mainline novel, &quot;A Rising Thunder&quot;, ties together events in both sub-series and synchronizes the timeline of each sub-series with Honor Harrington&#x27;s mainline novels. This book confirms the Solarian League is officially now the new Mesan cat&#x27;s paw, effectively at war with both the Star Empire of Manticore and the Republic of Haven, as it has been manipulated into error after error by the operatives of the Mesan Alignment.

==Setting==
Among a handful of anthologies, the thirteen Honor-centered novels, and two subordinate sub-series starring some different characters, the universe first explored in &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot; has a diasporal historical background for the backstory storyline, in which mankind, over almost two millennia, migrated to systems beyond the Sol system, first in slower-than-light starships, then by increasingly efficient and effective hyperspace drive-propulsion systems. Early daughter colonies also spawned colonies, forming regional networks of related populations. With travel limited to slower-than-light speeds, any marginally habitable nearby planet was of interest, and Earth&#x27;s scientists went through a period in which they regularly genetically modified the human genome for survival positive adaptations to marginal environments, such as heavy gravity, thin atmosphere, thick atmospheres, or toxic environments (e.g. Grayson). Some corporate entities also began breeding for super soldiers and superior intellects, good looks, sexual prowess, etc., or mixes of such traits, practices that led to a horrific &quot;Final War&quot; on Old Earth. Long-established and advanced daughter colonies like Beowulf mounted a variety of rescue missions and initiated a thousand-year effort to clean up the Earth gene pool. For a time, the cultural centre moved off the Earth as it took about 500 years for the planetary economy to recover its pre-eminence within its shell of highly populated, highly developed planets. Located in the center of the spherical Solarian League, Earth&#x27;s Old Chicago eventually re-emerged as the nominal League Capital.

By the Gregorian calendar currently in use, the Honorverse novels are dated beginning with year 2103 A.D.—the epoch date of the Diaspora&#x27;s beginning.

The FTL hyperspace propulsion system in the stories is around 600 years old at the time period in which the novels are placed. This technology uses the ability to &quot;sail&quot; along a vast network of &quot;gravity waves&quot; on different successively higher hyperbands, each higher band giving a more-efficient speed multiplier but requiring more powerful (therefore bulkier and more expensive) engines to reach; the higher bands significantly shortening transit times on a given gravity wave for a given base speed, which is limited by particle densities and radiation shielding as Newtonian speeds increase. Analogous to prevailing trade winds creating certain favoured sea routes on Earth, the relatively static fixed gravity waves form favoured travel paths. A lack of gravity waves in some regions means that they must be plodded across by relatively slower means. These favorite routes and desert crossing points are susceptible to illegitimate exploitation by pirates and commerce-raiding warships, both interested in preying on the rich pickings of the interstellar merchant cargo ships that carry upwards of 2–7 million metric tonnes of cargo.

Within each hyperband, ships have a local speed limited by particle densities that, at high relative speeds, become cosmic radiation. Better physical shielding or a better particle shield generator enables faster speeds within the band, on which base speed, multiplied by that band&#x27;s multiplier, results in shorter journey times. Merchant ships have immense size and thin walls with virtually no physical shielding, as well as cheaper, relatively weak particle shield generators and hyper generators. Commercial carriers, like sailing ships and freight trains of Old Earth, trade off journey time by increased size and volume carried, so as to keep shipping costs economical. Military vessels, having no profit motive and already physically shielded, also carry better particle shield generators and can attain much faster interstellar voyage times both within a band, and because their better protections enables them to enter higher hyperbands with higher local particle counts, but higher speed multipliers.

The interaction of gravity effects also manifest in much rarer, generally widely scattered wormholes, through which hyperdrive equipped ships can travel virtually instantaneously between the wormhole&#x27;s end points. In some systems, several of these wormholes are found to be co-located forming an irresistible trading nexus, perhaps because their ends have some mathematical affinity: they occur with entrances relatively close together in very small spatial volumes.

The greatest known aggregation of these co-located &quot;Junctions&quot; or Terminus Loci occurs in the Manticore binary star system, whose wormholes connect the wormhole junction to six (later seven) other star systems, giving the Manticore system an astrographic position to be coveted, and an immense revenue stream from transit tolls, manufacturing and trade, and a large carrying trade.

In the stories, no means of faster-than-light interstellar communications exists. Messages between star systems must be physically carried by starships. Even using the fastest ships available as couriers, this communications &quot;lag&quot; between worlds has many consequences, greatly increasing the responsibility placed upon starship captains and senior military commanders far from home, complicating the coordination of military campaigns, and allowing a single accident or attack to render a planet incommunicado.

The stories include numerous dependent and independent polities and several major star nations including two giant aggregations of many planets, Haven and the Solarian League. Protagonist Honor Harrington is a citizen of the Star Kingdom of Manticore which is, during the first 20 or so works of the series, the key rival and the main stellar protagonist against the star-conquering (People&#x27;s) Republic of Haven; these two nations are consciously based on Imperial Britain and Napoleonic France, although Haven also seems to be influenced by the former Soviet Union. The first books deal with a universe of escalating tensions and military incidents until war breaks out in the third novel and lasts until the formal peace in &quot;A Rising Thunder&quot;, the thirteenth mainline novel. Each star nation suffers horrendous losses at the end of the eleventh novel, &quot;At All Costs&quot;, during the Battle of Manticore, when Haven makes an all-out bid to conquer the Star Kingdom before general deployment of a feared &#x27;super weapon&#x27;. In the anthologies, Eric Flint and Weber wrote stories that birthed the first sub-series, resulting in the novels &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot; and &quot;Torch of Freedom.&quot; The sub-series introduced some far-more dangerous adversaries, the interstellar corporations of Mesa: Manpower Unlimited, Jessyk Combine, and others. This group was then revealed to be part of the even more dangerous and hidden secret adversaries of the shadowy Mesan Alignment. The Alignment included corrupted leaders of Solarian Core worlds promoting the destruction of the old order. Mesan puppet masters are revealed to be pulling the strings of corrupt Solarian League bureaucrats and admirals in both the sub-series and the main series. Enormously ambitious, the Alignment plans the overthrow of the Solarian League, and the complete destruction of the Star Kingdom of Manticore, Haven, Beowulf, and all of those polities&#x27; historic allies.

Disruptive technological advances have been few in the Honorverse for most of the 500 years leading up to the series; as the series opens, that technological stagnation has led to a similar stagnation in both military strategy and tactics. During the course of the book series, both forms of stagnation (technological and military) are brought to a violent end by developments stemming from the Havenite/Manticoran Wars, which give both Haven and Manticore a substantial technological advantage over the Solarian League by the time of the most recently published books of the series.

==Concept and creation==
David Weber didn&#x27;t set out to create a female protagonist; &quot;it was the way the character came to me,&quot; Weber explains. &quot;I didn&#x27;t set out to do it because I thought that it was especially politically sensitive on my part or because I thought it was likely to strike a chord with female readership or be a financial success. It was just the way that the character first presented herself.&quot; Weber doesn&#x27;t find writing a female character particularly challenging, because, he says, &quot;I&#x27;m writing about a human being who happens to be female.&quot; When he first started writing, he had developed her entire back story before he started the first book. However, since he knew from the beginning that these books would become a series, he deliberately set Honor up as a character who changes and grows. One example Weber offers is that in &quot;The Short Victorious War&quot;, Honor off-handedly refers to her genetically enhanced metabolism, which isn&#x27;t fully explored until &quot;In Enemy Hands&quot;: &quot;It was one of those little things that I knew about or that I was holding in reserve,&quot; Weber says.

The first name of his character—Honor—had come to Weber long before the last name did. Weber knew that if the Honor novels worked, she was inevitably going to be compared to C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower, so he saw to it that she had the same initials. He said, &quot;There are certainly, clearly, similarities between the two. There are also huge differences. And Honor has never been as neurotic as Hornblower was. Hornblower always carried a massive sense of inferiority around with him. Honor never did.&quot; Weber also feels that in the later books in the series, she has more in common with Admiral Horatio Nelson than Hornblower. Weber revealed in the foreword to &quot;Storm from the Shadows&quot; that it had originally been his intent to kill her off in the Battle of Manticore, thus further echoing Nelson&#x27;s death (in his greatest battle, Trafalgar) and have the emerging Mesa problem be dealt with by the next generation, specifically her children. When writing &quot;At All Costs&quot;, he decided instead to keep her alive, and move the Mesan-related events up, to be her problem.

==Publication==
Many of Weber&#x27;s books are available at the Baen Free Library; chapters of some texts are otherwise available online. The first-edition hardcover releases of &quot;War of Honor&quot;, &quot;At All Costs&quot;, &quot;Torch of Freedom&quot;, and &quot;Mission of Honor&quot; contained a CD with copies of most of Weber&#x27;s published books at the time, labeled for free redistribution.

===Spin-offs===
The Honorverse is a tightly plotted, highly organized invention that was designed with a specific overarching storyline. Its storyline has shifted from the original plan to include new enemies, and did not result in the battle death of heroine Honor Harrington, as was planned originally for book five, and then later for book eleven. The series&#x27; canon is maintained solely by its creator, who acts as editor of the works in the universe by other collaborating authors.

Like some of the strategy employed by co-author Eric Flint in his 1632 series, the series has, starting with &quot;War of Honor&quot;, begun incorporating a broader viewpoint from more than one central character, many of whom, like in the 1632 series, appeared in other series works as supporting characters. Stories in the Worlds of Honor collections directly lead to events and character stars of the &quot;Crown of Slaves&quot; (CoS) sub-series, whereas the &quot;Shadow of Saganami&quot;″s star cast and some of the characters of the CoS derive directly from the mainline novels. Both contain purposely invented new protagonist characters as well. Weber deliberately has synchronized events in the mainline series with the tellings of local knowledge and vice versa in both sub-series. In other words, the broad front on which he is now telling the overall story is geographically distinct, but synchronized in his timeline: events in one quadrant will affect life and events in the related narratives centred on other main characters.

Short fiction in the series serves as deep backstory or, like the short stories centred directly on Honor Harrington, exposes episodes of her earlier career in much the same way C. S. Forester revealed the not-yet-in-command life of the young Horatio Hornblower. Some of the more important of these tales reveal a greater knowledge of Sphinx&#x27;s native species, letting the reader in on knowledge not known even to the Honorverse occupants. Among these tales are the revealed history of how treecats and humans first bonded, how the treecats protected and bonded with the royal family, and other treecat tales of greater or lesser importance, such as how the treecat society decided to migrate to the stars. Other short stories expose points of view and life problems from places around the larger universe. Some offer insights to life behind enemy lines in the view of its citizens and their experience, or that of a protagonist in the Verge, or in the Solarian League.

===In other media===
In 2006, an Honor Harrington movie was announced by Echo Valley Entertainment.
However, later information suggested that it would actually be a television series, to be written and produced by Peter Sands. When David Weber was asked which actress he envisioned as Honor Harrington, he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anyone out there who has the proper combination of height, physicality, and demonstrated acting ability to be &#x27;perfect&#x27; for the role, so my mind is fairly open on this topic.&quot; Actress Claudia Christian, who plays Susan Ivanova on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, has been suggested as a potential candidate; Weber says &quot;She&#x27;s much shorter than Honor, but so are most women, and I think she could handle the physicality... I think it&#x27;s more important to have someone who can portray Honor&#x27;s character and command style than it is to have someone who is six feet two inches tall.&quot; Weber&#x27;s concern is that the director would push Christian to re-create Ivanova&#x27;s character while playing Honor and &quot;Ivanova&#x27;s command style is totally different from Honor&#x27;s.&quot;

An Honor Harrington wargame, &quot;Saganami Island Tactical Simulator&quot; (&quot;SITS&quot;), was released at Gen Con in 2005 by Ad Astra Games.

An Honor Harrington video game called &quot;Honorverse: The Online Game&quot; was announced in August 2008; a beta was scheduled to be released in the Spring of 2010.

In 2014 Evergreen Studios announced plans to make a multi-platform adaptation of the Honor Harrington character, under the title &quot;Tales of Honor&quot;. A mobile game called &quot;Tales of Honor: The Secret Fleet&quot; was released that year for Android and iOS platforms. Tentative plans at that point also included a television series and a feature film. Evergreen Studios shut down in 2015, which led to the cancelation of most of their projects, including the mobile game, which is no longer available.

Also, in 2014, a five-issue comic book miniseries &quot;Tales of Honor: On Basilisk Station&quot; from Top Cow Productions begun on March 5, 2014, concluding later that year. In 2015, Top Cow also released &quot;Tales of Honor: Bred to Kill&quot;.

<doc id="714503" wikidata="Q1472245" url="?curid=714503" title="Bauman Moscow State Technical University">
<text>The Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU; ), sometimes colloquially referred as the &quot;Bauman School&quot; or &quot;Baumanka&quot; (), is a public technical university (polytechnic) located in Moscow, Russia. Bauman University offers B.S., M.S &amp; PhD degrees in various engineering fields and applied sciences. In 2023, &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked it #1,758 in the world.

==History==

Bauman University is the second oldest educational institution in Russia after Lomonosov Moscow State University (1755). In 1763, the Russian Empress Catherine II founded the Educational Imperial House. On October 5, 1826, the dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna issued a decree to establish &quot;&quot;great workshops for different crafts with bedrooms, a dining room, etc.&quot; as a part of the Moscow Foundling Home in the German Quarter. All craft pupils were moved from an Orphanage there. On July 1, 1830, Emperor Nicholas I approved the Statute of Moscow Craft School.

Russia&#x27;s developing industry needed skilled labor in many trades with the aim of the new school being to train artisans with a theoretical background to improve and spread skills in various trades all over Russia. New schools were created to teach crafts as well as basic sciences. In 1868 MCS was reorganized into the Imperial Moscow Technical School (IMTS) under the directorship of Victor Della-Vos. The main purpose of IMTS was to &quot;educate construction engineers, mechanical engineers and industrial technologists&quot;&quot;.

The IMTS was financially supported by the Government and industrialists. Its management was democratic. A key feature of the new institution was its educational system called the &quot;Russian method&quot;, which unifies a broad and intensive theoretical preparation with a deep practical education closely connected with industries. The school participated in the Universal Exposition in 1873 in Vienna and the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876. It proved to be influential on John Daniel Runkle when he introduced manual training alongside theoretical training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It was also applied to other American technical universities. Many scientists taught in IMTS, such as D. Mendeleev, N. Jukovsky, P. Chebychev, S. Chaplygin, A. Yershov, D. Sovetkin, F. Dmitriev, A. Letnikov, A. Gavrilenko.

In the Soviet period IMTS was renamed Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School (BMHTS), after revolutionary Nikolay Bauman. BMHTS continued education of engineers for machine and instrument building. In 1938, new military departments were created in MHTS such as tank, artillery, and ammunition. In 1948 a rocket department was added.

During the first half of the 20th century, Bauman University formed and founded more than 70 technical universities in the USSR. Some of them are now well known institutions, such as Moscow Aviation Institute, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow University of Civil Engineering, Moscow Chemical Institute, Moscow Communication and Informatics University, Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute TSAGI, and the Military Academy of Aviation Engineering Joukovski.

On 27 July 1989 USSR State committee for peoples education conferred on Moscow Higher Technical School a name of Bauman Moscow Technical University (BMSTU). BMSTU was honored to be the first Russian technical university. Nearly 200,000 students graduated from the University. Most of them chose to become scientists or engineers in leading research centers, universities, private and government owned companies. Many of government officials, chief designers, CEOs of big enterprises, and cosmonauts are Bauman graduates, as noted below in the alumni section.

Many Bauman University graduates are world-renowned: Sergei Korolev for the first satellite in space and first man and woman in space, Andrey Tupolev for the world first supersonic passenger plane, Nikolay Dollezhal for the world first civil nuclear plant, Vladimir Shukhov for the first method and the world first petrol cracking plant as well as for the first hyperboloid structures in architecture, Nikolay Zhukovsky for the foundation of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics sciences, Pavel Sukhoi for the foundation of Sukhoi Aerospace Design Bureau.
Some of the specialized departments of BMSTU are located outside Moscow in cities of Moscow Oblast: Krasnogorsk (Russian: Красногорск), Reutov (Russian: Реутов), Korolyov (Russian: Королёв). There is also a large branch of the University in Kaluga (Russian: Калуга).

==Bauman University today==

The Bauman University is commonly regarded as one of Russia&#x27;s most prestigious universities and has high entry requirements for its prospective students.The Bauman University is regularly ranked first in official government and business press rating. The Bauman University also regularly occupies top 3 places in rating of alumni hunted by biggest Russian companies. In 2011/2012 QS World University rankings, BMSTU ranked 379th overall and 229th in Engineering &amp; IT.

The Bauman University has a National Research Center status, the financing of Bauman University is provided by a separate expense asset of Russian National Budget independently of Ministry of Education. BMSTU is Skolkovo innovation center founder.

===Sanctions===
The head of Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Anatoly Alexandrov signed a letter of support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On November 2, 2023, an agreement was reached between Bauman Moscow State Technical University for the development of design documentation for the so-called &quot;jihad machine&quot; (Jihad), a light and manoeuvrable buggy intended for use in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The authorities of Chechnya will be responsible for the serial production of this equipment.

==Educational programs==
The admissions process includes exams on math, physics, and Russian. The university accepts one in ten applicants, which means that there are more than 30000 applicants. More than 2,600 of them pass through two years of preparation courses, another 2,000 follow studies in high schools partners of Bauman University. Participation in admission process requires a gage of original high school certificate which prevents applicants to take part in Lomonosov Moscow State University admission process at the same time.

The academic year in this university begins on 1 September, and is divided into two terms (semesters). Students take exams at the end of each semester. The course of study lasts 6 years without interrupt for engineer specialist degree. But over the last few years the Bauman University has continued to integrate with the Bologna Process. And today some students learn using two step educational system. The first two years students study general engineering subjects. In the third year students begin to study specialized subjects. The university scientific library was founded in 1830.

== Branches ==

=== Dmitrov ===

The first order of the BMSTU Dmitrov Branch was bringing into service in 1965. In 1965–1973 – Suburban Educational and Science-Experimental Centre, in 1973–2000 – Educational-Experimental Centre.

=== Kaluga ===
In 1959 BMSTU opened in Kaluga the branch for education of the industrial machine- and device engineering personnel. Nowadays the BMSTU Kaluga Branch is a technical institute of Kaluga region. It consists of 7 buildings. The Kaluga Branch is an educational-science- manufacturing complex, including: 5 departments (machine engineering technologies; design-mechanical; electronics, informatics and management; socioeconomic; fundamental science), military education department, computer bureau, library with reading-rooms, sport camp and sport pavilion.

==Publishing==

The Bauman University Publishing House was established in January, 1989 on the base of university publishing department. The first issue of &quot;Baumanets&quot; newspaper was printed on 18 February 1923. At that time the newspaper was called &quot;Udarnik&quot;. It has been printed for 90 years since then.

In 1990 Bauman Publishing House started issuing theoretical and applied broad-scoped &quot;Vestnik MSTU&quot;. There are educational materials in different scientific areas: Physical and Mathematical sciences, Information and Computer science, Optics, Mechanical, Radio, Instrument and Power Engineering, Laser Technology, Economics, Law and other subjects.

<text>The Battle of Point Pleasant, also known as the Battle of Kanawha and the Battle of Great Kanawha, was the only major action of Dunmore&#x27;s War. It was fought on October 10, 1774, between the Virginia militia and Shawnee and Mingo warriors. Along the Ohio River near modern-day Point Pleasant, West Virginia, forces under the Shawnee chief Cornstalk attacked Virginia militiamen under Colonel Andrew Lewis, hoping to halt Lewis&#x27;s advance into the Ohio Valley. After a long and furious battle, Cornstalk retreated. After the battle, the Virginians, along with a second force led by Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, marched into the Ohio Valley and compelled Cornstalk to agree to a treaty, which ended the war.

==Preparations==
Colonel Andrew Lewis, in command of about 1,000 men, was part of a planned two-pronged Virginian invasion of the Ohio Valley. As Lewis&#x27;s force made its way down the Kanawha River, guided by pioneering hunter/trapper Matthew Arbuckle Sr., Lewis anticipated linking up with another force commanded by Lord Dunmore, who was marching west from Fort Pitt, then known as Fort Dunmore. Dunmore&#x27;s plan was to march into the Ohio Valley and force the indigenous inhabitants to accept Ohio River boundary which had been negotiated with the Iroquois in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix.

The Shawnee, however, had not been consulted in the treaty and many were not willing to surrender their lands south of the Ohio River without a fight. Officials of the British Indian Department, led by Sir William Johnson until his death in July 1774, worked to diplomatically isolate the Shawnee from their neighbors. As a result, when the war began, the Shawnees had few allies other than some Mingos.

Cornstalk, the Shawnee leader, moved to intercept Lewis&#x27;s army, hoping to prevent the Virginians from joining their forces together. Estimates of the size of Cornstalk&#x27;s force have varied, but scholars now believe Cornstalk was probably outnumbered at least 2 to 1, having between 300 and 500 warriors. Future Shawnee leader Blue Jacket most probably took part in this battle.

==Battle==
Cornstalk&#x27;s forces attacked Lewis&#x27;s camp where the Kanawha River joins the Ohio River, hoping to trap him along a bluff. The battle lasted for hours and the fighting eventually became hand-to-hand. Cornstalk&#x27;s voice was reportedly heard over the din of the battle, urging his warriors to &quot;be strong.&quot; Lewis sent several companies along the Kanawha and up a nearby creek to attack the warriors from the rear, which reduced the intensity of the Shawnee offensive. Captain George Mathews was credited with a flanking maneuver that initiated Cornstalk&#x27;s retreat. At nightfall, the Shawnees quietly withdrew back across the Ohio. The Virginians had held their ground, and thus are considered to have won.

==Aftermath==
The Virginians lost about 75 killed and 140 wounded. The Shawnee&#x27;s losses could not be determined, since they carried away their wounded and threw many of the dead into the river. The next morning, Colonel Christian, who had arrived shortly after the battle, marched his men over the battlefield. They found twenty-one dead warriors in the open, and twelve more were discovered hastily covered with brush and old logs. Among those killed was Pucksinwah, the father of Tecumseh.

Besides scalps, the Virginians reportedly captured 40 guns, many tomahawks and some plunder which was later sold at auction for 74£ 4s 6d.

The Battle of Point Pleasant forced Cornstalk to make peace in the Treaty of Camp Charlotte, ceding to Virginia the Shawnee claims to all lands south of the Ohio River (today&#x27;s states of Kentucky and West Virginia). The Shawnee were also obligated in the Treaty of Camp Charlotte to return all white captives and stop attacking barges of immigrants traveling on the Ohio River.

Colonel John Field, an ancestor of United States Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, was killed in the battle.

==Legacy and historical controversies==

In April 1775, before many of the Virginians had even returned home from Dunmore&#x27;s War, the battles of Lexington and Concord took place in Massachusetts. The American Revolution had begun and Lord Dunmore led the British war effort in Virginia. By the end of that year, the same militiamen who had fought at Point Pleasant managed to drive Lord Dunmore and the British troops supporting him out of Virginia.

Before his expulsion, Dunmore had sought to gain indigenous allies, including the Shawnee the militia had defeated at Point Pleasant. Many Virginians suspected he had collaborated with the Shawnee from the beginning. They claimed Dunmore had intentionally isolated the militia under Andrew Lewis, meaning for the Shawnee to destroy them before the Royal Army troops arrived. Dunmore hoped to eliminate the militia in case a rebellion did break out. However, there is no evidence to support this theory and it is generally discounted.

On February 21, 1908, the United States Senate passed Bill Number 160 to erect a monument commemorating the Battle of Point Pleasant. It cites Point Pleasant as a &quot;battle of the Revolution&quot;. The bill failed in the House of Representatives.

Nevertheless, the Battle of Point Pleasant is honored as the first engagement of the American Revolution during &quot;Battle Days&quot;, an annual festival in modern Point Pleasant, now a city in West Virginia.

<doc id="714521" wikidata="Q1614803" url="?curid=714521" title="Ruby-Spears">
<text>Ruby-Spears Productions (also known as Ruby-Spears Enterprises) was an American entertainment production company founded by veteran writers and &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; creators, Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, in 1977, before closing in 1996. Specialized in animation, it was headquartered in Burbank, California, with another branch in Rome, Italy.

== History ==
Ruby and Spears started out as sound editors at Hanna-Barbera and later branched out into story-writing for such programs as &quot;Space Ghost&quot; and &quot;The Herculoids&quot;. In 1969, they were assigned the task of developing a mystery-based cartoon series for Saturday mornings, the result of which was &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;. They left Hanna-Barbera shortly after because &quot;they were having a hard time moving up&quot; and wanted to be &quot;associate producers&quot;. They were also writers and producers for DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, particularly for &quot;The Barkleys&quot; and &quot;The Houndcats&quot;.

The company was founded in 1977 as a subsidiary of Filmways (later Orion Pictures) and sold in late 1981 to Taft Broadcasting, becoming a sister company to Hanna-Barbera, while Ruby and Spears were network executives at ABC supervising the Saturday-morning programming. ABC Entertainment president Fred Silverman wanted to create competition for Hanna-Barbera, which then provided the bulk of the Saturday morning content for all three major networks. Silverman was concerned the studio was stretching their projects too thin, diluting the quality of their series, requiring competition. The company&#x27;s first production was &quot;The Puppy Who Wanted a Boy&quot;. The company&#x27;s credits include the animated series &quot;Fangface&quot;, &quot;Goldie Gold and Action Jack&quot;, &quot;The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show&quot;, &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;, &quot;Rubik, the Amazing Cube&quot;, the 1983 version of the &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; series, &quot;Mister T&quot;, &quot;Sectaurs&quot;, &quot;Centurions&quot;, the 1988 &quot;Superman&quot; series, the &quot;Police Academy&quot; animated series and the American &quot;Mega Man&quot; cartoon series.

Among the unrealized projects at the studio were &quot;Roxie&#x27;s Raiders&quot;, an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-style serial about a female adventurer and her allies; &quot;Golden Shield&quot;, about an ancient Mayan hero seeking to save earth in the apocalyptic year 2012; and &quot;The Gargoids&quot;, about scientists who gain superpowers after being infected by an alien virus.

Ruby and Spears&#x27; favorite Ruby-Spears-produced show was &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;.

Only two pre-1991 series, &quot;Police Academy: The Animated Series&quot; and &quot;Piggsburg Pigs!&quot;, used Canadian rather than American voice talent like most of their other cartoons. Ruby-Spears was also responsible for the animated sequence in the 1988 film &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; and replaying the sequence as a fictional commercial in the 1991 sequel &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot;.

In 1991, Ruby-Spears was spun off into RS Holdings. Most of the pre-1991 Ruby-Spears Productions library was sold along with Hanna-Barbera to Turner Broadcasting System, which in turn merged with Time Warner (now Warner Bros. Discovery) in 1996. The Ruby-Spears studio closed later that year, after 19 years of operation. As of now, Ruby-Spears&#x27; pre-1991 library is owned by Warner Bros. through Warner Bros. Animation. The few pre-1991 Ruby-Spears shows not owned by Warner Bros. are &quot;&quot;, which is owned and distributed by StudioCanal which also own and distribute the first three live-action &quot;Rambo&quot; films, &quot;It&#x27;s Punky Brewster&quot;, which is owned by Universal Television (but distributed by MGM Television outside the US, along with most of the pre-2004 NBC Studios library), and &quot;Piggsburg Pigs!&quot;, which is owned by The Walt Disney Company through its acquisition of Fox Kids Worldwide (now ABC Family Worldwide) in 2001.

Ruby-Spears&#x27; post-1991 library does not appear to be owned by any company, however there are a few exceptions: &quot;Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa&quot; is now owned by WildBrain, &quot;Mega Man&quot; is owned by Shochiku and &quot;Skysurfer Strike Force&quot; is owned by Invincible Entertainment Group through 41 Entertainment, along with most of the Bohbot Entertainment library.

The founders both died in 2020 within three months of each other – Ruby died of natural causes on August 26 at the age of 87 and Spears died of complications from Lewy body dementia on November 6 at age 82.

<doc id="714524" wikidata="Q471417" url="?curid=714524" title="Steve Prefontaine">
<text>Steve Roland &quot;Pre&quot; Prefontaine (January 25, 1951 – May 30, 1975) was an American long-distance runner who from 1973 to 1975 set American records at every distance from 2,000 to 10,000 meters. He competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics, and he was preparing for the 1976 Olympics with the Oregon Track Club at the time of his death in 1975.

Prefontaine&#x27;s career, alongside those of Jim Ryun, Frank Shorter, and Bill Rodgers, generated considerable media coverage, which helped inspire the 1970s &quot;running boom&quot;. He was killed in an automobile crash near his residence in Eugene, Oregon at the age of 24. One of the premier track meets in the world, the Prefontaine Classic, is held annually in Eugene in his honor. Prefontaine&#x27;s celebrity and charisma later resulted in two 1990s feature films about his short life.

==Early life==
Prefontaine was born on January 25, 1951, in Coos Bay, Oregon. His father, Raymond George Prefontaine (November 11, 1919 – December 21, 2004), was a welder who served in the U.S. Army in World War II. Steve&#x27;s mother, Elfriede Anna Marie Sennholz (March 4, 1925 – July 16, 2013), worked as a seamstress. The two returned to Coos Bay after Ray met Elfriede in Germany while serving with the U.S. occupation The middle child and only son, he had two sisters, Neta and Linda, and they all grew up in a house built by their father.

Prefontaine was an exuberant person, even during his formative years. He was always moving around, partaking in different activities and events. In junior high, Prefontaine was on his school&#x27;s football and basketball teams but was rarely allowed to play because of his short stature. In the eighth grade, he noticed several high school cross country team members jog to practice past the football field, an activity he then viewed as mundane. Later that year, he realized he could compete well in long-distance races during a three-week conditioning period in his physical education class. By the second week of the daily mile runs, Prefontaine could finish second in the group. With this newfound success and athletic ability, he fell in love with cross country running.

==High school (1965–69)==

When he got into Marshfield High School in the fall of 1965, Prefontaine joined the cross country team, coached by Walt McClure Jr. McClure had run under coach Bill Bowerman at the University of Oregon in Eugene and his father, Walt McClure Sr. had run under Bill Hayward, also at Oregon.

Prefontaine&#x27;s freshman and sophomore years were decent, and he managed a personal best of 5:01 in the mile in his first year. Though starting as the seventh man, he progressed to be the second by the end of the year and placed 53rd in the state championship. In his sophomore year, he failed to qualify for the state meet in his event, the two-mile. However, his coach recalls that it was his sophomore year when his potential in the sport began to surface.

With the advice of Walt McClure, Prefontaine&#x27;s high school coach, he took it upon himself to train hard over the summer. He went through his junior cross country season undefeated and won the state title.

In his senior year, many of his highest goals were set. He obtained a national record at the Corvallis Invitational with a time of 8:41.5, only one and a half seconds slower than his goal, and 6.9 seconds better than the previous record. He won two more state titles that year after another undefeated season in both the one and two mile 

Some forty colleges across the nation recruited Prefontaine, and he received numerous phone calls, letters, and drop-in visits from coaches. He referred many of his calls to McClure, who wanted Prefontaine to attend the University of Oregon. McClure turned away those universities that began trying to recruit him late. McClure maintained that he did not sway Prefontaine&#x27;s collegiate choice, except to ask Steve where all the runners went to college.

Prefontaine wanted to stay in-state for college and attend the University of Texas. He had not heard much from Bill Bowerman, the head coach for the University of Oregon. Prefontaine only received letters from Oregon once a month, whereas other universities such as Villanova were persistent in recruiting him. As a result, Prefontaine did not know how much Bill Bowerman wanted him to attend Oregon. Bowerman stated that he did not recruit Prefontaine differently from anyone else. It was a matter of principle for him to advise recruits where to attend college, wherever it may be, and to not bombard the recruits with correspondence. He had followed Prefontaine&#x27;s career since he was a sophomore and agreed with McClure in his assessment of Steve being a highly talented athlete.

It was not until Prefontaine read Bowerman&#x27;s letter that he decided to attend the University of Oregon. Bowerman wrote that he was &#x27;certain&#x27; Prefontaine would become the world&#x27;s greatest distance runner if he decided to run at Oregon. Although it was an odd promise, Prefontaine was up for the challenge. Sometime after Prefontaine announced that he signed a letter of intent to attend Oregon on the first of May in 1969, Bowerman wrote a letter addressed to the community of Coos Bay describing his appreciation for their role in helping Steve become a great runner.

==University of Oregon (1969–1973)==
Steve Prefontaine decided to enroll at the University of Oregon to train under coach Bill Bowerman (who in 1964 co-founded Blue Ribbon Sports, later to become known as Nike). He won four 5,000-meter titles in track three times in a row. At this time, he suffered only two more defeats in college (both in the mile), winning three Division I NCAA Cross Country Championships and four straight three-mile/5000-meter titles in track. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

Prefontaine became known as a very aggressive front runner, insisting on going out hard from the start and not relinquishing leads, reminiscent of the renowned 1956 Olympic gold medalist Vladimir Kuts, another famous front runner at 5,000 meters. Prefontaine said, &quot;No one will ever win a 5,000 meter race by running an easy first two miles. Not against me.&quot; He would later state, &quot;I am going to work so that it&#x27;s a pure guts race. In the end, if it is, I&#x27;m the only one that can win it&quot;. Along with his reputation for leading early instead of pacing himself until the last lap, Prefontaine had tremendous leg speed; his career-best for the mile (3:54.6) was only 3.5 seconds off the world record at the time.

A local celebrity, chants of &quot;Pre! Pre! Pre!&quot; became a frequent feature at Hayward Field, a place where famous runners ran. Fans liked to wear T-shirts that read &quot;LEGEND&quot; or &quot;GO PRE&quot;, though there was one instance where a group of fans jokingly put on shirts that read &quot;STOP PRE&quot;. Prefontaine found humor in the shirts and, when offered, decided to wear one for his victory lap. Prefontaine rapidly gained national attention and appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; at age 19 in June 1970. He was on the cover of &quot;Track and Field News&#x27;s&quot; November 1969 issue.

===1972 Summer Olympics===
In 1971, he began his training for the following year&#x27;s Olympic Games in Munich, which had special meaning for his family (his mother was German, and his parents had met and married in Germany). Prefontaine set the American record of 13:22.8 in the 5,000 meters at the 1972 Olympic Trials in Eugene on July 9. An underdog at the 1972 Olympics in Munich in September, Prefontaine took the lead in the 5,000 m final during the last mile and ended the slow pace of the first two miles, negative splitting the race. In second place at the start of the bell lap, he fell back to third with 200 meters to go. Lasse Virén took the lead in the final turn over eventual silver medalist Mohammed Gammoudi. Finding himself struggling to keep up, Prefontaine ran out of gas with only 10 meters to go as Britain&#x27;s hard-charging Ian Stewart overtook him and moved into third place, depriving Prefontaine of an Olympic bronze medal. Prefontaine later said &quot;That was the most disappointed I have ever been. I guess I underestimated the strength of Virén and Gammoudi, and Stewart was way too good for me at the end. That last 200 metres, I felt exhausted. They didn&#x27;t allow me to run the race the way I had planned to, I was chasing them all the way.&quot; Following his fourth-place finish in the Olympic Games, Prefontaine went back to the University of Oregon with a newfound enthusiasm for running after his disappointing showing at the Olympics. This disappointment in his performance drove Pre to train harder than ever for his senior year of athletics, often logging over 10 miles per morning before he started his day.

In his four years at Oregon, Prefontaine never lost a collegiate (NCAA) race at 3 miles, 5,000 meters, 6 miles, or 10,000 meters. Returning for his senior he ended his collegiate career with only three defeats in Eugene, all in the mile. It was during this year that Prefontaine began a protracted fight with the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), which demanded that athletes who wanted to remain &quot;amateur&quot; for the Olympics not be paid for appearances in track meets. Some viewed this arrangement as unfair, because the participants drew large crowds that generated millions of dollars in revenue, with the athletes being forced to shoulder the burden of all their own expenses without assistance. At the time, the AAU was rescinding athletes&#x27; amateur status if they were endorsed in any way. Because Prefontaine was accepting free clothes and footwear from Nike, he was subject to the AAU&#x27;s ruling.

==After college (1974–75)==

Following his collegiate career at Oregon, Prefontaine prepared for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. While running for the Oregon Track Club, Prefontaine set American records in every race from 2,000 to 10,000 meters.
In 1974, Prefontaine gave a presentation at a banquet. It was held in Eugene the night prior to the Junior College Cross Country Championships. Prefontaine talked about the importance of cross country through his own eyes. After his death, the notes Prefontaine made were given to his family.

==Death==
In 1975, a group of traveling Finnish athletes took part in an NCAA Prep meet at Hayward Field in Eugene. After the event on Thursday, May 29, which included a 5,000-meter race that Prefontaine won, the Finnish and American athletes attended a party at the home of former Duck runner Geoff Hollister. Shortly after midnight, Prefontaine left the party to drive Frank Shorter to Kenny Moore&#x27;s home on Prospect Drive, then descended narrow Skyline Boulevard alone, east of the university campus near Hendricks Park. While in the extended right curve near the base, his gold-colored 1973 MGB convertible crossed the center line, jumped the curb, hit a rock wall () and flipped, trapping him underneath it. One of the first people at the scene was 20-year-old Karl Bylund, who raced from the scene in his car to his residence to fetch his father, a doctor. A nearby resident, Bill Alvarado (1936–2006), arrived next at the scene (he had heard Bylund&#x27;s car screeching off) and reported that he found the man flat on his back, unconscious and pinned beneath the wreck. Prefontaine was pronounced dead at the scene on the arrival of paramedics. He was 24 years old at the time of his death in the crash. His blood alcohol content was found by the Eugene Police Department to The official cause of his death was traumatic asphyxiation. No other injuries contributed to his death.

Prefontaine&#x27;s body was buried in his hometown of Coos Bay at Sunset Memorial Park. A day after his funeral in Coos Bay, a memorial service at Hayward Field in Eugene drew thousands.

===Aftermath===
Eugene&#x27;s &quot;Register-Guard&quot; called his death &quot;the end of an era&quot;. At his death, Prefontaine was probably the most popular athlete in Oregon and, along with Jim Ryun, Frank Shorter, Jeff Galloway and Bill Rodgers, was credited with sparking the national running boom of the 1970s. An annual track event, the Prefontaine Classic, has been held in his memory since 1975. Known as the &quot;Hayward Field Restoration Meet&quot; in its first two years, it was rebranded as the &quot;Bowerman Classic&quot; for 1975 and set for June 7. Two days after Prefontaine&#x27;s death, it was renamed by the Oregon Track Club on June 1, with Bill Bowerman&#x27;s approval, and the first &quot;Pre Classic&quot; was held six days later.

During his career, Prefontaine won 120 of the 153 races he ran (), and never lost a collegiate (NCAA) track race longer than one mile at the University of Oregon. In 2020, SuperWest Sports included Prefontaine in its list of The Greatest Pac-12 Male Track and Field Athletes of All Time.

===Memorials===

====Pre&#x27;s Rock====

&quot;Pre&#x27;s Rock&quot; is a memorial at the base of the roadside outcrop where Prefontaine died. An engraved stone memorial with a picture of Prefontaine, it reads:

&quot;PRE&quot;

Runners inspired by Prefontaine leave behind memorabilia to honor his memory and his continued influence, such as race numbers, medals, and running shoes. Paying such homage to Prefontaine has become a tradition that reaches a height during important or noteworthy running events in Eugene (e.g. the Olympic Trials or the Prefontaine Classic). As University of Oregon professor Daniel Wojcik documents in his study of the memorial, Pre&#x27;s Rock has become both a grassroots shrine and pilgrimage site for athletes and non-athletes from around the world.

Pre&#x27;s Rock was dedicated in December 1997 and is maintained by Eugene Parks and Recreation as &quot;Prefontaine Memorial Park&quot;. The rock () is a mile (1.6 km) due east of Hayward Field, just across the Willamette River from the east end of Pre&#x27;s Trail. On Skyline Boulevard, it is approximately from its intersection with Birch Lane.

====Other memorials====
The Prefontaine Memorial, featuring a relief of his face, records, and date of birth, is located at the Coos Bay Visitor Center in Coos Bay. In 2008, ten memorial plaques were laid along the Prefontaine Memorial Race route, the former training grounds of Prefontaine. The plaques bear an image of Prefontaine from his high school yearbook and various quotes and records from his time in Coos Bay. The plaques were part of a grant from the Oregon Tourism Commission, the Coos Bay-North Bend Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau, and the Prefontaine Memorial Committee.

Each year on the third Saturday of September in Coos Bay, over a thousand runners engage in the Prefontaine Memorial Run, a 10k run honoring his accomplishments.

The Coos Art Museum in Coos Bay contains a section dedicated to Prefontaine. This section includes medals he won during his career and the pair of spikes he wore when setting an American record for the 5,000 meters at Hayward Field.

Prefontaine was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1983, where several exhibits showcase his shoes, shirts, and other memorabilia. He was also inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in upper Manhattan where one of his Oregon track uniforms is on display.

The Pete Susick Stadium at Marshfield High School in Coos Bay dedicated their track to honor Prefontaine, in April 2001.

Nike used video footage in a commercial titled &quot;Pre Lives&quot; advertising his spirit for their product. On the 30th anniversary of his death in 2005, Nike placed a memorial advertisement in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Eugene&#x27;s &quot;Register-Guard&quot;, and aired a television commercial in his honor. Nike&#x27;s headquarters have a building named after him.

The day after Prefontaine&#x27;s death, the &quot;Register-Guard&quot; printed &quot;Ode to S. Roland&quot;, a poem by chief American rival Dick Buerkle.

Prefontaine remains an iconic figure at the University of Oregon to this day. In 2020, the university polled alumni and fans on social media, asking them which four UO alumni they would place on a national Mount Rushmore for the university. Prefontaine was one of the four winners, along with Nike co-founder Phil Knight; current NFL player Marcus Mariota, the 2014 Heisman Trophy winner; and Sabrina Ionescu, who had just completed an epic college basketball career for the Ducks.

==In popular culture==
Steve Prefontaine&#x27;s life story has been detailed in two feature films: 1997&#x27;s &quot;Prefontaine&quot; (starring Jared Leto as Prefontaine) and 1998&#x27;s &quot;Without Limits&quot; (starring Billy Crudup as Prefontaine), as well as the documentary film &quot;Fire on the Track&quot;.

&quot;Prefontaine&quot; is the fifth track off Madchild&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Lawn Mower Man&quot;.

Minnesota Golden Gopher Head Football Coach P.J. Fleck uses “Prefontaine Pace” among his many motivational sayings.

In the song &quot;Strong,&quot; by country singer Charles Wesley Godwin, Prefontaine is mentioned in the chorus with the lines:
&quot;But I can see you coming around the bend, and kicking until the end, like Prefontaine from an outside lane, proving them wrong, coming on strong&quot;

==Personal bests==
At the time of his death in May 1975, Prefontaine held every American outdoor track record between 2,000 and 10,000 meters. His personal best times over each distance, including those records, are below.

<doc id="714528" wikidata="Q3181184" url="?curid=714528" title="John Cannis">
<text>John Cannis (; born November 4, 1951) is a Canadian politician. He was a former member of the House of Commons of Canada.

==Background==
Born in Kalymnos, Greece, Cannis was raised and educated in Toronto, Ontario. A successful entrepreneur for 18 years, Cannis owned a Toronto-based international executive search firm and was a member in good standing of Association of Professional Placement Agencies and Consultants. He also served as a computer and human resource consultant.

Cannis and his wife of more than 40 years, Mary, have three children; Irene (Tony), Paul (Christina), Daniel and four grandchildren.

==Politics==
Cannis ran as the Liberal candidate in the 1993 election in the riding of Scarborough Centre and was elected as a Member of Parliament. He continued to serve for 18 years before his defeat by Conservative Roxanne James in 2011.

From 1999 to 2001, Cannis served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry. As Parliamentary Secretary, he successfully guided four pieces of legislation through the House of Commons and committee stages; specifically, the Privacy Act, the Space Agency Act, the Canadian Tourism Commission Act and the Patent Act.

Notable committee appointments included Vice-Chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence, Chair of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs, Chair of the Subcommittee on International Trade, Trade Disputes and Investment (SINT) of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade (FAAE) and as Vice-Chair on the Standing Committee on Transport.

In 2004, when the Khadr family returned to Canada, they were met by a loud wave of public sentiment in favour of revoking their citizenship and deporting them.

==Biography==
McGee was born in Berryberg, West Virginia, and was raised in Steubenville, Ohio. He graduated from Wilberforce University in 1937. After serving in the United States Army, he received a law degree from The Ohio State University in 1948.

In 1959, he became the 23rd president of the Dayton Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP.

In May 1970, Mayor Dave Hall resigned for health reasons. The City Commission deadlocked for two months with tie votes of 2-2 with McGee and Michael Liskany each receiving the vote of another commissioner. Liskany ultimately announced that he would drop out, allowing McGee to become mayor.

McGee was re-elected in 1973 and 1977 before stepping down. After leaving politics, he continued with his legal practice.

==Personal life==
He met his wife, Elizabeth while he was in law school. They had two daughters, Annette and Frances. Both of the daughters followed their father, and went into practicing law.

James McGee died on March 4, 2006, in Trotwood, Ohio.

==Legacy==

Both have their its origins in the pre-7th-century (Old English) word &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;new&quot;, with &quot;&quot;, meaning man. Its first recorded uses were Godwin Nieweman in Oxfordshire, England, in 1169, and in Germany, Herman Nyeman of Barth in 1325.

<text>Richie Wilcox (born 1980) is a Canadian theatre director, singer and performer who - alongside his husband and collaborator Aaron Collier - currently helms Heist, a live art company committed to creating, producing and presenting innovative, genre-bending and queerly playful performances. Wilcox is also the current Artistic Producer at the Ship&#x27;s Company Theatre.

Wilcox was a contestant on the first season of reality television show &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in New Waterford, Nova Scotia, Wilcox&#x27;s first national performance came on a Rita MacNeil Christmas television special when he was nine years old.

== Education ==
Wilcox subsequently studied drama at University College of Cape Breton (now Cape Breton University) and Dalhousie University, graduating with honours from the Theatre Studies program at University of King&#x27;s College. He completed his master&#x27;s degree in Theatre Direction at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. He is pursuing a PhD in theatre at York University in Toronto, where he taught Second Year Devised theatre.

== Career ==
In 2003, on the first season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;, Richie Wilcox finished in a three-way tie for eighth place. He was eliminated after the first week of Top 11 performances, although fellow Halifax singer Gary Beals went on to finish in second place.

Before &quot;Idol&quot;, he was assistant manager of a deli. After &quot;Idol&quot;, from 2003 to 2005, Wilcox wrote a weekly column about reality shows for &quot;The Daily News&quot;.

Wilcox has performed in and directed numerous theatre productions in Halifax. He co-founded independent theatre company, Angels &amp; Heroes. After four increasingly successful seasons with the indie troupe and two summers acting and directing in a company called Festival Antigonish, Wilcox went on to complete a master&#x27;s degree in Theatre Direction at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas before returning to Halifax in 2007. He won a Merritt Award for Emerging Theatre Artist in 2007.

In 2024, he had a supporting role as a therapist in Taylor Olson&#x27;s film &quot;Look at Me&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Wilcox is gay.

<doc id="714543" wikidata="Q556036" url="?curid=714543" title="Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory">
<text>The Brønsted–Lowry theory (also called proton theory of acids and bases) is an acid–base reaction theory which was developed independently in 1923 by physical chemists Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted (in Denmark) and Thomas Martin Lowry (in the United Kingdom). The basic concept of this theory is that when an acid and a base react with each other, the acid forms its conjugate base, and the base forms its conjugate acid by exchange of a proton (the hydrogen cation, or H+). This theory generalises the Arrhenius theory.

== Definitions of acids and bases ==

In the Arrhenius theory, acids are defined as substances that dissociate in aqueous solutions to give H+ (hydrogen ions or protons), while bases are defined as substances that dissociate in aqueous solutions to give OH− (hydroxide ions).

In 1923, physical chemists Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted in Denmark and Thomas Martin Lowry in England both independently proposed the theory named after them. In the Brønsted–Lowry theory acids and bases are defined by the way they react with each other, generalising them. This is best illustrated by an equilibrium equation.

: acid + base ⇌ conjugate base + conjugate acid.

With an acid, HA, the equation can be written symbolically as:

:&lt;chem&gt;HA + B &lt;=&gt; A- + HB+ &lt;/chem&gt;

The equilibrium sign, ⇌, is used because the reaction can occur in both forward and backward directions (is reversible). The acid, HA, is a proton donor which can lose a proton to become its conjugate base, A−. The base, B, is a proton acceptor which can become its conjugate acid, HB+. Most acid–base reactions are fast, so the substances in the reaction are usually in dynamic equilibrium with each other.

== Aqueous solutions ==
Consider the following acid–base reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt;CH3 COOH + H2O &lt;=&gt; CH3 COO- + H3O+ &lt;/chem&gt;

Acetic acid, , is an acid because it donates a proton to water () and becomes its conjugate base, the acetate ion (). is a base because it accepts a proton from and becomes its conjugate acid, the hydronium ion, ().

The reverse of an acid–base reaction is also an acid–base reaction, between the conjugate acid of the base in the first reaction and the conjugate base of the acid. In the above example, ethanoate is the base of the reverse reaction and hydronium ion is the acid.

:&lt;chem&gt;H3O+ + CH3 COO- &lt;=&gt; CH3COOH + H2O &lt;/chem&gt;

One feature of the Brønsted–Lowry theory in contrast to Arrhenius theory is that it does not require an acid to dissociate.

== Amphoteric substances ==

The essence of Brønsted–Lowry theory is that an acid is only such in relation to a base, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Water is amphoteric as it can act as an acid or as a base. In the image shown at the right one molecule of acts as a base and gains to become while the other acts as an acid and loses to become .

Another example is illustrated by substances like aluminium hydroxide, .
:&lt;chem&gt;\overset{(acid)}{Al(OH)3}{} + OH- &lt;=&gt; Al(OH)4^-&lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;3H+{} + \overset{(base)}{Al(OH)3} &lt;=&gt; 3H2O{} + Al_{(aq)}^3+&lt;/chem&gt;

=== Non-aqueous solutions ===
The hydrogen ion, or hydronium ion, is a Brønsted–Lowry acid when dissolved in H2O and the hydroxide ion is a base because of the autoionization of water reaction
:&lt;chem&gt;H2O + H2O &lt;=&gt; H3O+ + OH- &lt;/chem&gt;

An analogousreaction occurs in liquid ammonia
:&lt;chem&gt;NH3 + NH3 &lt;=&gt; NH4+ + NH2-&lt;/chem&gt;

Thus, the ammonium ion, , in liquid ammonia corresponds to the hydronium ion in water and the amide ion, in ammonia, to the hydroxide ion in water. Ammonium salts behave as acids, and metal amides behave as bases.

Some non-aqueous solvents can behave as bases, i.e. accept protons, in relation to Brønsted–Lowry acids.

:&lt;chem&gt;HA + S &lt;=&gt; A- + SH+&lt;/chem&gt;

where S stands for a solvent molecule. The most important of such solvents are dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO, and acetonitrile, , as these solvents have been widely used to measure the acid dissociation constants of carbon-containing molecules. Because DMSO accepts protons more strongly than the acid becomes stronger in this solvent than in water. Indeed, many molecules behave as acids in non-aqueous solutions but not in aqueous solutions. An extreme case occurs with carbon acids, where a proton is extracted from a bond.

Some non-aqueous solvents can behave as acids. An acidic solvent will make dissolved substances more basic. For example, the compound is known as acetic acid since it behaves as an acid in water. However, it behaves as a base in liquid hydrogen fluoride, a much more acidic solvent. 

:&lt;chem&gt;CH3COOH + 2HF &lt;=&gt; CH3C(OH)2+ + HF2- &lt;/chem&gt;

== Comparison with Lewis acid–base theory==

In the same year that Brønsted and Lowry published their theory, G. N. Lewis created an alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure. A Lewis base is a compound that can give an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an electron pair. Lewis&#x27;s proposal explains the Brønsted–Lowry classification using electronic structure.

:&lt;chem&gt;HA + B &lt;=&gt; A- + BH+ &lt;/chem&gt;

In this representation both the base, B, and the conjugate base, A−, are shown carrying a lone pair of electrons and the proton, which is a Lewis acid, is transferred between them.
Lewis later wrote &quot;To restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen.&quot; In Lewis theory an acid, A, and a base, B, form an adduct, AB, where the electron pair forms a dative covalent bond between A and B. This is shown when the adduct H3N−BF3 forms from ammonia and boron trifluoride, a reaction that cannot occur in water because boron trifluoride hydrolizes in water.

: &lt;chem&gt;4BF3 + 3H2O -&gt; B(OH)3 + 3HBF4 &lt;/chem&gt;

The reaction above illustrates that BF3 is an acid in both Lewis and Brønsted–Lowry classifications and shows that the theories agree with each other.

Boric acid is recognised as a Lewis acid because of the reaction
:&lt;chem&gt;B(OH)3 + H2O &lt;=&gt; B(OH)4- + H+ &lt;/chem&gt;

In this case the acid does not split up but the base, H2O, does. A solution of B(OH)3 is acidic because hydrogen ions are given off in this reaction.

There is strong evidence that dilute aqueous solutions of ammonia contain minute amounts of the ammonium ion
:&lt;chem&gt;H2O + NH3 -&gt; OH- + NH+4 &lt;/chem&gt;

and that, when dissolved in water, ammonia functions as a Lewis base.

== Comparison with the Lux–Flood theory ==
The reactions between oxides in the solid or liquid states are excluded in the Brønsted–Lowry theory. For example, the reaction 
:&lt;chem&gt;2MgO + SiO2 -&gt; Mg2 SiO4 &lt;/chem&gt;
is not covered in the Brønsted–Lowry definition of acids and bases. On the other hand, magnesium oxide acts as a base when it reacts with an aqueous solution of an acid.
:&lt;chem&gt;2H+ + MgO(s) -&gt; Mg^{2+}(aq) + H2O &lt;/chem&gt;

Dissolved silicon dioxide, SiO2, has been predicted to be a weak acid in the Brønsted–Lowry sense.
:&lt;chem&gt;SiO2(s) + 2H2O &lt;=&gt; Si(OH)4 (solution) &lt;/chem&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;Si(OH)4 &lt;=&gt; Si(OH)3O- + H+ &lt;/chem&gt;

According to the Lux–Flood theory, oxides like MgO and SiO2 in the solid state may be called acids or bases. For example, the mineral olivine may be known as a compound of a basic oxide, MgO, and silicon dioxide, SiO2, as an acidic oxide. This is important in geochemistry.

<text>The Radical Party (, PR) was a liberal and libertarian political party in Italy.

For decades, inspired by 19th-century classical radicalism, the Radical Party was a bastion of anti-clericalism, civil libertarianism, feminism, liberalism and radicalism in Italy as well as environmentalism. The party proposed itself as the strongest opposition to the Italian political establishment, seen as corrupt and conservative. Although it never reached high shares of vote and never participated in government, the party had close relations with the other parties of the Italian left—from the Republicans and the Socialists to the Communists and Proletarian Democracy—and opened its ranks also to members of other parties through dual membership.

The party&#x27;s longtime leader was Marco Pannella (1930–2016), who served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies (1976–1994) and the European Parliament (1979–2009), leading the party in most of the elections it contested.

In 1989, the PR was transformed into the Transnational Radical Party, a non-governmental organisation tasked with defending liberal and left-libertarian values. During the 1990s, the Radicals had formed a succession of electoral lists (notably including the Pannella List and Bonino List), without having a structured party and sometimes dividing themselves between competing lists. The latest incarnation of the party is the Italian Radicals, founded in 2001, former section of Transnational Radical Party.

== History ==

The PR was founded in 1955 by the left wing of the Italian Liberal Party as the ideal continuation of the historical Radical Party, active from 1877 to 1925, emphasising liberal and secular issues such as separation of church and state and the full implementation of the Constitution. Leading members of the new party included Bruno Villabruna, Mario Pannunzio, Ernesto Rossi, Leo Valiani, Guido Calogero, Giovanni Ferrara, Paolo Ungari, Eugenio Scalfari and Marco Pannella.

Following a leadership crisis in 1963, most party members left the PR and joined the Italian Socialist Party or the Italian Republican Party; the remaining members, under the leadership of Pannella and Gianfranco Spadaccia took control of the party, which abandoned its original social-liberal views and adopted a strong left-libertarian position. The &quot;new&quot; PR came to political success in the 1976 general election, when it entered Parliament with four deputies: Pannella, Emma Bonino, Adele Faccio and Mauro Mellini. In the 1979 general election, the party won 3.5% of the vote and elected 18 deputies and two senators, its best result ever and by far the largest gain of any party in the Chamber of Deputies. The relative success of the party was a consequence of the new line impressed by Pannella who moved the party&#x27;s focus to issues like divorce and abortion, also by winning three referendums on those issues in 1974 and 1981. In 1979, following the first European Parliament direct election, the PR was involved with Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties (CEGRP) and its unsuccessful efforts to create a single pan-European platform for green and radical politics.

From 1976, the PR used the fist and rose emblem created by the French Socialist Party and later used by the Socialist International, although they were not ideologically close: Pannella had managed to obtain the permission because the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) lacked internal support to remove its traditional symbols, which included the Marxist hammer and sickle. In 1980, it decided to add a thick, diagonal black armband as a sign of mourning to its logo to pay homage to the part of humanity which was victim of hunger and war, reflecting its internationalist turn.

In the 1980s, the party focused more on international and European issues. Affiliated to the Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties/European Green Coordination, Pannella was a member of the European Parliament since 1979 and led the party into new battles against hunger and in favour of further European integration. The party European affiliation were the Technical Group of Independents (1979–1984), Non-Inscrits (1984–1989) and Green Group. In 1989, the party was transformed into the Transnational Radical Party, a non-governmental organisation working at the United Nations and coordinating the efforts of several national parties and groupings mainly in support of human rights.

The Radicals continued to participate in elections through the Antiprohibitionists on Drugs list, the Rainbow Greens, the Pannella List, the Bonino List and the Bonino-Pannella List. In 2001 they re-organised themselves as a party with the Italian Radicals and Bonino served in two governments (Prodi II – 2006–2008 and Letta – 2013–2014). Pannella died after a long illness in 2016.

== Ideology ==
The PR gave expression to the transformation of Italian society towards more liberal behaviour and ideas in the post-war period. An anti-clerical party, it placed itself within the libertarian left, often working for the unity of all the parties of the Italian left and proposing the adoption of an American-style electoral system based on first-past-the-post voting and the transformation of Italian institutions toward a presidential system, but also often being rejected by certain areas of the left itself, especially those linked with the Italian Communist Party, due to the Radicals&#x27; strong support of anti-communism, their economic liberalism, and their belief in social, religious, political, economic, and sexual freedoms. The party was also known for its strong belief in direct democracy and especially for its promotion of referendums.

== Associations ==
In the 1960s, the PR launched the Italian League for Divorce (&quot;Lega Italiana per il Divorzio&quot;, LID), which succeeded in marshalling together the secular parties into a unified political alliance and getting the law on divorce approved. During the 1970s, the PR helped launch the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement (&quot;Movimento di Liberazione della Donna&quot;, MLD) by supporting the activities of the Italian Centre for Sterilisation and Abortion (&quot;Centro Italiano Sterilizzazioni e Aborti&quot;, CISA) and by giving its support to the Italian Revolutionary Homosexual United Front (&quot;Fronte Unitario Omosessuale Rivoluzionario Italiano&quot;, FUORI), one of the first Italian homosexual associations. All the aforementioned groups, as well as many others, were part of a Radical movement that was organised as a federation of single-issue associations rather than a united party.

The Italian League for Divorce developed a broad following with the 1974 referendum to repeal the Divorce Law which had been passed three years prior. The referendum was initiated by Gabrio Lombardi with the support of the Christian Church as a form of reactionary opposition to legal divorce. The campaign for a no vote, in opposition to the Christian Democrats, was mostly led by unofficial party leader Marco Pannella, who was a fierce champion for the rights of woman. This led to further connections with left-wing groups within Italy at the time such as the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Communist Party. Because of the enormous campaigning effort done by Pannella, the divorce referendum resulted in around 60% of citizens voting in favour of protecting divorce laws, and this was considered to be largely to the credit of Radical Party, which emboldened the LID.

The PR found its first connections to Fuori! in the 1970s when Angelo Pezzana, a member of the Radical Party and one of the founders of the Italian Revolutionary Homosexual United Front, had attempted to further politicise the association and connect it with the party. In 1974, at the 14th congress of the Radical Party, Fuori! was officially federated as a part of the Radical Party, resulting in the dissatisfaction and withdrawal of some Fuori! members, such as Mario Mieli. By the 15th congress, which took place in 1976, Fuori! had announced a list of candidates to run for positions within the party, thus marking the first time in which Italy had openly homosexual citizens run as candidates within a party elections, and by 1979, Angelo Pezzana became a member of the Italian parliament. Pezzana was in office for less than a month before retirement, but continued to write on his experiences on the advancement of Italian homosexual rights, as facilitated by the Radical Party.

Considered an early example of a political party placing importance on environmentalist issues, from 1972 onwards the PR also formed environmental organisations, including the Friends of the Earth&#x27;s Italian chapter, the League Against Vivisection and League Against Hunting.

== Popular support ==

The PR never gained massive support in elections, due to its loose organisation and eclectic profile. Additionally, the party did not file candidates for all the elections and sometimes even supported abstention from voting. The Radicals&#x27; strongest showing was in the 1979 general election, when it obtained 3.5% of the vote and 18 deputies.

The PR did better in the North (especially in Piedmont) and in large cities (Rome, Milan, Turin and Naples) than in the South and in rural areas.

<doc id="714569" wikidata="Q2514433" url="?curid=714569" title="Moosehead Lake">
<text>Moosehead Lake is a deep, coldwater lake located in Piscataquis County in Northwestern Maine. It is the largest lake in Maine and the largest lake wholly within New England, the second-largest lake in New England after Lake Champlain, and the largest mountain lake in the eastern United States. Situated in the mostly undeveloped Longfellow Mountains, the lake is the source of the Kennebec River. Several rural Townships border the lake. Greenville is by far the largest town on the lake, with a small downtown area that has banks, shops, and restaurants. There are over 80 islands in the lake, the largest being Sugar Island and Deer Island to the west being the second largest.

==History==

Mount Kineo, with cliffs rising straight up from Moosehead Lake, has attracted visitors for centuries, from early American Indians (Red Paint People), to later tribes seeking its rhyolite to make stone tools, Penobscots and Norridgewocks, the Abenaki bands who battled here with their enemy the Mohawks, to 19th-century &quot;rusticators&quot; traveling by railroad and steamboat and today&#x27;s hotel guests. Various species dwell among its cliffs and talus slopes, including peregrine falcons and rare plants.

The Moosehead region includes the headwaters of the Kennebec, the West Branch of the Penobscot, the Piscataquis, the Pleasant, and the Saint John rivers. Henry David Thoreau and other 19th-century visitors remarked on the beauty of the area.
Thoreau described the lake as “...a gleaming silver platter at the end of the table.”
The region has a large moose population; moose outnumber people 3:1. However, the name of the region derives from the remarkable similarity between maps of the lake and an antlered moose.

==Geography==
Set at an elevation of , Moosehead Lake is approx. , with an area of nearly 118 mile² (approx.
303 km2), and over of shoreline. Its major inlet is the Moose River, which, east of Jackman, flows through Long Pond to Brassua Lake. To the east of Moosehead Lake, the Roach River is its second largest tributary. Flowing out of Moosehead Lake to the southwest are its east and west outlets—the Kennebec River.

The Moosehead Lake Region encompasses of North Central Maine, and includes 127 incorporated and unincorporated townships in addition to Moosehead Lake. The region is drained by of main stem rivers, into which flow of smaller tributaries. During the last glacial era, more than 1,200 natural lakes and ponds were carved into its landscape, varying in size from ponds to Moosehead which, at , is one of the largest natural freshwater lakes in the United States. The total area of all standing surface waters in the region is more than – 24% of the total area of lakes and ponds in Maine.

==Climate==
There is a weather station in the unincorporated namesake community of Moosehead on the middle part of the western lakeshore. The area has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). Winters are cold and snowy, whereas summers are mild due to its relative elevation. The annual temperature of about are similar to Quebec City in the St. Lawrence River valley further north and much colder than Maine&#x27;s and the nearby Canadian maritime provinces&#x27; coastal areas. Winter temperatures are similar to subarctic inland northern Sweden and Finland and as a result, boreal forests dominate the shoreline in spite of being in the mid-latitudes. Because of its cold climate, the lake becomes completely frozen over for about 5 months each year.

==Development plans==

Seattle-based Plum Creek Real Estate Investment Corporation, the largest private United States landowner, submitted a development proposal for the Moosehead region in April 2005. It was the largest development ever proposed for the state of Maine. 
The initial version of the scheme called for 975 house lots, two resorts, a golf course, a marina, three RV parks, and more than 100 rental cabins. However, Plum Creek was defunct as of 2016 and all development plans have been cancelled.

In January 2021, a $75 million investment was made into developing the 1,700-acre Big Squaw Mountain Resort into a year-round tourist attraction that would include a new ski-lift system, a large hotel, lakefront condominiums, and a marina. The plans are being made by local developer Perry Williams, along with Louisiana-based developers at Provident Resources Group.

<text>Sekele is the northern language of the ǃKung dialect continuum. It was widespread in southern Angola before the Angolan Civil War, but those varieties are now spoken principally among a diaspora in northern Namibia. There are also a number of dialects spoken in far northern Namibia.

Sekele is known by a number of names. &quot;Sekele&quot; itself derives from &quot;Vasekele&quot;, the Angolan Bantu name. It is also known as Northern ǃKung, Northern ǃXuun, and Northern Ju. Two of the Angolan varieties have gone by the outdated term ǃʼOǃKung (or &quot;ǃʼO ǃuŋ&quot; , &quot;Forest ǃKung&quot;) and Maligo (short for &quot;Sekele Maligo&quot;). There are several Namibian dialects, of which the best-known is Ekoka.

== Dialects ==
There is a division between the northernmost dialects, formerly known as Angolan ǃKung or Northern ǃKung, and the more southern dialects of northernmost Namibia, which are known as Western ǃKung or North-Central ǃKung, as well as between them and the eastern dialect of Kavango ǃKung. These northern dialects include:

*Angolan (Northern) ǃKung, originally of Southern Angola, which is situated around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando Rivers;
::(N1) Maligo (&quot;ǃxuun, kúándò ǃxuun&quot; &quot;Kwando ǃXuun&quot;, southeast Angola);
::(N2) ǃʼOǃKung (&quot;ǃʼo ǃuŋ&quot; &quot;Forest ǃXuun&quot;; east central Angola);
*Western (North-Central) ǃKung (ǃKung-Ekoka), of northern Namibia, between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border, around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan;
::(W1) — (&quot;ǃxūún, ǃʼālè ǃxòān&quot; &quot;Valley ǃXuun&quot;; Eenhana district, northern Namibia);
::(W2) ǀʼAkhwe (&quot;ǃxūún, ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān&quot; &quot;Kwanyama ǃXuun&quot;; Eenhana, northern Namibia);
::(W3) Tsintsabis (&quot;ǃxūún&quot;; Tsintsabis, Tsumeb district, northern Namibia);
*(K) Kavango ǃKung (&quot;ǃxūún&quot;, known as &quot;dom ǃxūún&quot; &quot;River ǃXuun&quot; in Ekoka; Western Rundu district, northern Namibia, &amp; Angola adjacent)

The Okongo, Ovambo, and Mpunguvlei dialects may duplicate (W1) and (K) or be additional forms.

A dialect of Angolan Sekele currently being investigated by linguists has been labeled Mangetti Dune ǃKung, and is spoken by a resettled diaspora community of 500–1000 in Namibia and South Africa in the settlements of Mangetti Dune and Omtaku, east of Grootfontein, Namibia; and in Schmidtsdrif, west of Kimberley, South Africa.

==Phonology==
;Angolan ǃKung
Mangetti Dune ǃKung has clicks with four places of articulation, . A reported distinction between dental lateral and postalveolar lateral clicks has not been confirmed by further research. These clicks come in the same eight series as in Grootfontein ǃKung, represented with the palatal articulation:
:Lingual 
:glottalized 
:linguo-pulmonic 
:linguo-glottalic 

;Western (North-Central) ǃKung

<doc id="714573" wikidata="Q211464" url="?curid=714573" title="Invensys">
<text>Invensys Limited was a multinational engineering and information technology company headquartered in London, United Kingdom. At its height, the company had offices in more than 50 countries and its products were sold in around 180 countries.

Invensys was formed in 1999 through the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc. It was originally founded on 1 April 1920 as &quot;Siebe Gorman &amp; Company Ltd&quot; and continued through various name changes registered at Companies House from that date. Invensys lines of business were grouped into four segments: Software, Industrial Automation, Energy Controls and Appliance. Its brands included Avantis, Eurotherm, Foxboro, IMServ, InFusion, Triconex, SimSci, Skelta, Wonderware, Drayton, Eberle, and Eliwell.

Less than three years after its establishment, Invensys was in financial hardship, in part due to having overpaid for acquisitions such as the Baan Corporation at the height of the dotcom bubble and having accumulated a heavy debt burden. Through several divestments and a major restructuring, the company&#x27;s fiscal situation had improved by 2005, allowing the pace of acquisitions to pick up. Considerable business was being obtained by its various products in the railway sector, which it opted to align under the Invensys Rail brand. Invensys Rail was ultimately sold to the German engineering conglomerate Siemens in exchange for £1.7 billion in May 2013.

Between 2011 and early 2012, the company&#x27;s share price fell by nearly 50%, which was attributed to a £40 million expense from the delayed production of control and safety systems for eight Chinese nuclear reactors. In response, Invensys began openingly seeking to be acquired by a larger company, approaching the American industrial automation company Emerson Electric without any bid being made. During January 2014, Invensys was taken over by the French multinational Schneider Electric for a total consideration of $5.5 billion. Schneider opted to fully integrate the company and phased out the &quot;Invensys&quot; brand in favour of its own.

==History==
Invensys was formed through the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in 1999. Between 1999 and 2004, it underwent a major restructuring programme involving thousands of redundancies to cut its costs amid falling sales and a sizeable debt burden that allegedly posed the possibility of the company going bankrupt. A major disposal programme combined with a £2.7bn debt restructuring during 2004 saved Invensys from collapse. It was under this strategy that The Baan Corporation, which it purchased in 2000 amid the dotcom bubble for €762 million, was sold three years later for only US$135 million. Several other elements, such as Fasco motors and Eurotherm Drives, were also divested to refinance the company.

During May 2005, following the completion of the refinancing effort, Rick Haythornthwaite resigned his position as Invensys&#x27; chief executive, his position was filled by Ulf Henriksson. In May 2006, the French multinational Schneider Electric announced that it would acquire Invensys Building Systems (IBS) operations in both North America and Asia in exchange for $296 million. During December 2007, Invensys arranged to sell its Firex Safety Division to United Technologies. That year, the company opted to expand its presence in Indonesia.

In late 2009, as part of an effort to align its various brands and names in the railway sector together, Westinghouse Rail Systems was renamed Invensys Rail. At the time, Invensys Rail was one of a handful of companies that produced equipment compatible with the new European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). During 2011 alone, deals cumulatively valued at £700 million were secured by Invensys Rail from numerous organisations such as Network Rail and Obrascón Huarte Lain for its signalling products.

In March 2011, Wayne Edmunds, who had been Invensys&#x27; chief financial officer since 2009, was appointed Chief Executive, replacing Ulf Henriksson. According to &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, Henriksson, who had been Invensys&#x27;s Chief Executive since 2005, had had differences with chairman Nigel Rudd over the company&#x27;s management, in spite of the return to financial health under Henriksson.

During the late 2000s and early 2010s, Invensys became increasingly involved in the Chinese market across various sectors, including the rail and power generation sectors. Between 2011 and early 2012, the company&#x27;s share price dropped by almost 50%, the devaluation being largely attributed to a £40 million expense associated with delays in the production of control and safety systems for eight Chinese nuclear reactors. On 2 May 2013, Invensys sold off its Wiltshire-based rail division to the German engineering conglomerate Siemens in exchange for £1.7 billion, the majority of which being used to address a deficit in its company pension scheme.

In 2012, Invensys held discussions with the American industrial automation company Emerson Electric on a prospective takeover, although Emerson never issued any firm approach. That same year, the company&#x27;s management team was compelled to issue a denial of a comment made by Henriksson that he expected China Southern Rail to make a substantial offer to obtain a stake in Invensys. The two companies had previously signed licensing agreements that led to Invensys Rail Group&#x27;s signalling products being locally produced in China as well as to jointly sell those products to China&#x27;s expansive mass transit market.

During July 2013, it was announced that Invensys was set to be taken over by Schneider Electric, one of the firm&#x27;s long term competitors, for a total consideration of £3.4 billion. The deal was noted to likely involve job losses as Schneider revealed plans to make cost savings of around €140m (£122m) per year. Reports claimed that the American engineering conglomerate General Electric was planning to issue its own £3.5 billion ($5.3 billion) counterbid for control of Invensys. The takeover was completed on 17 January 2014 and Invensys was declared to have been fully integrated by Schneider seven months later.

<doc id="714575" wikidata="Q292525" url="?curid=714575" title="AGM-69 SRAM">
<text>The Boeing AGM-69 SRAM (Short-Range Attack Missile) was a nuclear air-to-surface missile. It had a range of up to , and was intended to allow US Air Force strategic bombers to penetrate Soviet airspace by neutralizing surface-to-air missile defenses.

The SRAM was designed to replace the older AGM-28 Hound Dog standoff missile which was tasked with the same basic role. The Hound Dog was a very large missile that could only be carried in pairs by the B-52, so some aircraft were tasked with suppressing Soviet missile and radar sites while others would carry on to strike their strategic targets. The SRAM was so much smaller that a number could be carried along with other weapons, allowing a single aircraft to blast a nuclear path through to its targets.

The SRAM entered service in 1972 and was carried by a number of aircraft, including the B-52, FB-111A, and the B-1B. In September 1980 a ground fire raised concerns about the safety of the warhead, and in 1990 they were temporarily removed from service while safety checks were carried out. These revealed a number of the missiles&#x27; rocket motors had developed cracks that could have resulted in them exploding when launched.

The SRAM was removed from service in 1993. The weapon was to be replaced by the AGM-131 SRAM II and the new W89 warhead, but the program was terminated at the end of the Cold War.

==History==
The Air Force had been considering the idea of a medium-range missile to attack air defense sites since the mid-1950s. This concept became more important with the Soviet introduction of the SA-2 missile, which presented a serious threat to the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command&#x27;s (SAC) bomber fleet. The first attempt to address this role led to the GAM-67 Crossbow, which flew for the first time in 1956. However, the Crossbow&#x27;s subsonic speed meant it could not get far enough ahead of the bomber to be useful. A supersonic development, the Longbow, was under development, but ultimately cancelled as well.

The role was finally filled by the AGM-28 Hound Dog, a much larger supersonic missile. The Hound Dog served the dual purpose of attacking defense sites as well as being a stand-off missile to use against strategic targets so that the bombers did not have to approach them. However, Hound Dog was so large that only two could be carried by a B-52, and only if it removed all other weapons. A more practical system specifically for the counter-defense role was highly desirable.

===AGM-69A SRAM===
The requirement for the weapon was issued by the Strategic Air Command in 1964, and the resultant AGM-69A SRAM contract was awarded to Boeing in 1966. After delays and technical flaws during testing, it was ordered into full production in 1971 and entered service in August 1972. It was carried by the B-52, FB-111A, and, for a very short period starting in 1986, by B-1Bs based at Dyess AFB in Texas. SRAMs were also carried by the B-1Bs based at Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota, Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota, and McConnell AFB in Kansas up until late 1993.

SRAM had an inertial navigation system as well as a radar altimeter which enabled the missile to be launched in either a semi-ballistic or terrain-following flight path. The SRAM was also capable of performing one &quot;major maneuver&quot; during its flight which gave the missile the capability of reversing its course and attacking targets that were behind it, sometimes called an &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; launch. The missile had a circular error probable (CEP) of about and a maximum range of . The SRAM carried the W69 warhead with an estimated yield of .

The SRAM missile was completely coated with of soft rubber, used to absorb radar energy and also dissipate heat during flight. The three fins on the tail were made of a phenolic material, also designed to minimize any reflected radar energy. All electronics, wiring, and several safety devices were routed along the top of the missile, inside a raceway.

On the B-52 SRAMs were carried externally on two wing pylons (six missiles on each pylon) and internally on an eight-round rotary launcher mounted in the bomb bay; maximum load-out was 20 missiles. Each of the B-1B&#x27;s 3 internal stores bays could each contain a rotary launcher capable of holding up to 8 missiles, for a maximum loadout of 24 missiles. The smaller FB-111A could carry two missiles internally and four more missiles under the aircraft&#x27;s swing-wing. The externally mounted missiles required the addition of a tailcone to reduce aerodynamic drag during supersonic flight of the aircraft. Upon rocket motor ignition, the missile tailcone was blown away by the exhaust plume.

About 1,500 missiles were built at a cost of about $592,000 each by the time production ended in 1975. The Boeing Company sub-contracted with the Lockheed Propulsion Company for the propellants, which subsequently closed with the end of the SRAM program.

===AGM-69B SRAM===
An upgraded AGM-69B SRAM was proposed in the late 1970s, with an upgraded motor to be built by Thiokol and a W80 warhead, but it was cancelled by President Jimmy Carter (along with the B-1A) in 1978. Various plans for alternative guidance schemes, including an anti-radar seeker for use against air defense installations and even a possible air-to-air missile version, came to nothing.

===AGM-131 SRAM II===

A new weapon, the AGM-131 SRAM II, began development in 1981, intended to arm the resurrected B-1B, but it was cancelled in 1991 by President George Bush, along with most of the U.S. Strategic Modernization effort (including Peacekeeper Mobile (Rail) Garrison, Midgetman small ICBM and Minuteman III modernization) in an effort by the U.S. to ease nuclear pressure on the disintegrating Soviet Union.

===1990s===
In June 1990, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the missiles removed from bombers on alert pending a safety inquiry. A decade earlier in September 1980, A B-52H on alert status at Grand Forks AFB in northeastern North Dakota experienced a wing fire that burned for three hours, fanned by evening winds of . The wind direction was parallel to the fuselage, which likely had SRAMs in the main bay. Eight years later, weapons expert Roger Batzel testified to a closed U.S. Senate hearing that a change of wind direction could have led to a conventional explosion and a widespread scattering of radioactive plutonium.

The AGM-69A was retired in 1993 over growing concerns about the safety of its warhead and rocket motor. There were serious concerns about the solid rocket motor, when several motors suffered cracking of the propellant, thought to occur due to the hot/cold cycling year after year. Cracks in the propellant could cause catastrophic failure once ignited.

<doc id="714584" wikidata="Q3445783" url="?curid=714584" title="Assumption University (Worcester)">
<text>Assumption University is a private, Roman Catholic university in Worcester, Massachusetts, United States. Assumption was founded in 1904 by the Augustinians of the Assumption. It enrolls about 2,000 students and offers 37 majors and 50 minors. The university confers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in its undergraduate program, and Master of Arts, Master of Science, and Master of Business Administration degrees as well as graduate study certificates.

With the transition from Assumption College to Assumption University in 2020, Assumption reorganized into five schools: the D&#x27;Amour College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Grenon School of Business, the Froelich School of Nursing, the School of Health Professions, and the School of Graduate Studies.

==History==
===Early Years===
Assumption was founded in 1904 by the Augustinians of the Assumption, a Catholic order under the Augustinian Rule dedicated to service through teaching and the hastening of the Kingdom of God, as reflected in their motto &quot;Until Christ be Formed in You&quot;. The original campus was in the Greendale section of Worcester, on a tract of hillside land. In these early years, enrollment was exclusively male, primarily of French-Canadian heritage. Most courses were taught in French, with only a small number taught in English. On March 24, 1923, an arson fire destroyed the Greendale building that held both the college classrooms and the student dormitories.

On June 9, 1953, a violent F4 tornado cut a path of destruction through several western and central Massachusetts communities, including the city of Worcester. Several campus buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. Although the previously co-located Assumption Preparatory School stayed on the rebuilt campus until 1970, the then-College relocated to a new campus off Salisbury Street, on the west side of the city, officially opening in 1956. The old Assumption campus complex was sold to the state after the prep school closed and is today the home of Quinsigamond Community College.

=== Transition to University ===
On June 10, 2020, Assumption College officially transitioned to Assumption University. With this transition, the university reorganized into five schools: the D&#x27;Amour College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Grenon School of Business, the Froelich School of Nursing, the School of Health Professions, and the School of Graduate Studies.

On October 17, 2022, interim president Greg Weiner was appointed the 17th president of Assumption. President Weiner was formally installed at his inauguration held on March 23, 2023. He is the first Jewish president of a Catholic college or university in the United States.

Assumption&#x27;s first class of nursing students graduated from the Froelich School of Nursing in 2023 with a 100 percent passing rate on the National Council Licensure Examination for registered nurses (NCLEX-RN). The program was then granted professional accreditation in 2024 from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.

In October 2024, Assumption&#x27;s Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies program was granted accreditation-provisional status from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). The first cohort of PA students began in January 2025.

In December 2024, five students at Assumption University were charged with kidnapping and conspiracy after an incident in which police said the students attacked an active-duty member of the U.S. military, accusing him of being a sexual predator. Police said there was no evidence that the man was trying to date anyone under age 18, but he had been lured to campus by a student who identified herself on the dating app Tinder as an adult. One of the five students was also charged with intimidation and another with assault and battery with a deadly weapon, after telling campus police that he slammed the victim&#x27;s head into a car door. A sixth student involved was a minor. Police said the students posted videos of the attack online, participating in a fad on the video app TikTok based on the former reality TV show To Catch a Predator. The Assumption president, Dr. Weiner, said the behavior described by police was &quot;abhorrent and antithetical to Assumption University&#x27;s mission and values.&quot;

== Campus ==
Assumption&#x27;s 185-acre (75 ha) campus is in Worcester, Massachusetts, New England&#x27;s second-largest city behind Boston, and located 43 miles (69 km) to the east. The campus sits in a neighborhood off Salisbury Street on the northwest side of the city.

The original Assumption campus was in the Greendale section of Worcester but was destroyed in the 1953 Worcester tornado that killed nearly 94 people in central Massachusetts. Assumption relocated to its current location off Salisbury Street, officially opening in 1956 with the completion of La Maison Francaise. Many campus buildings prominently feature stained glass windows in their design, and in some cases (such as in the Chapel of the Holy Spirit) the windows were recovered from the university&#x27;s Greendale campus, which was destroyed by the 1953 tornado, and are now dedicated in memory of the three Assumption community members who perished in the storm.

As of 2025, the campus consists of 47 buildings, including 16 residential options, 10 academic buildings, and six athletic facilities. The campus is also home to the Emmanuel d&#x27;Alzon Library, completed in 1988 and named after Emmanuel d&#x27;Alzon, a French Catholic priest who founded the Assumptionists. 

The Chapel of the Holy Spirit serves as the center of the university&#x27;s spiritual community. The Chapel and adjoining Tinsley Campus Ministry Center welcome students regardless of their religion to freely practice their faith through the various Catholic and interfaith services and facilities they offer.

As part of a university investment in developing a nursing program, the Richard J. and Sophia Catrambone Health Sciences Center was completed in November 2020. The 41,000-square-foot, three-story building features state-of-the-art nursing education equipment and is home to the Froelich School of Nursing.

In 2020, Assumption formally named Brian Kelly &#x27;83 Stadium in honor of football head coach Brian Kelly, a member of the class of 1983. 

The university&#x27;s primary dining hall, Taylor Dining Hall, underwent a $1 million renovation project in 2024 as a part of a new partnership with Aramark Collegiate Hospitality.

==Athletics==

Assumption University teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division II in most sports. The Greyhounds are a member of the Northeast-10 Conference (NE10). 

In 1979, Assumption became one of the founding member institutions of the NE10 (then the Northeast-7). Longtime Assumption men&#x27;s basketball head coach Andy Laska is considered a &quot;founding father&quot; of the conference.

In 2022, it was announced that the women&#x27;s ice hockey team would compete in the New England Women&#x27;s Hockey Alliance, an NCAA Division I conference. It is the only team at Assumption to compete in Division I.

Current men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

Assumption also offers several club sports, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cheerleading, a dance team, equestrian, figure skating, fishing, gymnastics, Latin dance, martial arts, running, ultimate frisbee, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s volleyball, women&#x27;s soccer, and women&#x27;s weightlifting.

In addition, Assumption offers intramural sports tournaments each academic year. These sports include 5v5 basketball, battleship, beach volleyball, dodgeball, flag football, floor hockey, indoor soccer, kickball, lawn games, ping-pong, soccer, soccer billiards, softball, volleyball, wallyball, and wiffle ball.

In 2024, Assumption earned its 14th straight NCAA President&#x27;s Award for Academic Excellence, presented annually to NCAA Division II athletics programs with a 90 percent or higher academic success rate (ASR). Assumption is just one of seven schools to win the award each year it has been presented.

<text>Wambierzyce is a village and popular Catholic pilgrimage site in south-western Poland, in Gmina Radków, Kłodzko County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It is situated at an altitude of 370–410 m in the picturesque Cedron valley on the eastern slopes of the Table Mountains. It lies approximately south-east of Radków, west of Kłodzko, and south-west of the regional capital Wrocław.

==History==
It is located in Kłodzko Land, a territory which in the Middle Ages often changed owners between Polish and Bohemian rulers. The place was first mentioned in 1330 as &quot;Alberndorf&quot;, then in 1398 as &quot;Alberdorf&quot;, in 1418 as &quot;Alberti villa&quot;, in 1560 as &quot;Alberichsdorf&quot;, which then evolved into the German name &quot;Albendorf&quot;. Czech pilgrims from Bohemia and Moravia called the place &quot;Vambeřice&quot;. In the 18th century, it was annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, in 1945, it became part of Poland under the Polish name &quot;Wambierzyce&quot;.

==Pilgrimage==

The wooden statue of Our Lady, dating from the thirteenth century, was originally placed in a mighty linden tree located at this site. According to the legend a blind man regained his eyesight after praying before the statue. After that miracle a stone altar was erected in front of the tree. The first wooden chapel was built in 1263. A larger church was built in 1512 but was destroyed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The present pilgrimage Church of the Visitation of Our Lady goes back to a church built in 1695–1710 following a design thought to resemble the Temple in Jerusalem. However, all but the mighty Renaissance façade had to be torn down already three years later because the structure had become unsafe. The fourth and present church in Baroque style was then built 1715–1723, and financed by the local nobleman and owner Count Franz Anton von Götzen. Around the church and village a huge calvary (a set of chapels dedicated to the Passion of Christ) was built. In 1936 the church received the status of a &#x27;Basilica minor&#x27; from Pope Pius XI. Pope John Paul II awarded the Madonna of Wambierzyce the title of &quot;Queen of Families&quot; in 1980. It is nicknamed the &quot;Silesian Jerusalem&quot;.

==Sports==
The local football club is WLKS Wambierzyce. It competes in the lower leagues.

<text>ǂKxʼaoǁʼae (English pronunciation: , native pronunciation: ), also rendered ǂKxʼauǁʼein ( ), or Gobabi ǃKung (&quot;Gobabis-ǃXû&quot;), is an eastern dialect of the Southern ǃKung language, spoken in Botswana (the settlements of Groote Laagte, East Hanahai, Kanagas and Ghanzi in Ghanzi District and on the commercial farms) and in Namibia (the city of Gobabis and settlements along the C22 road to Otjinene as far as Eiseb, Omaheke Region) by about 7,000 people. In Botswana, most speakers are bilingual in Naro or Tswana.

There are numerous spellings of the name, including &quot;ǁAuǁei, ǁXʼauǁʼe,&quot; and &quot;Auen&quot;. Endonyms are &quot;Juǀʼhoan(si), ǃXun&quot; in Namibia and &quot;ǂXʼaoǁʼaen&quot; (predominantly in Botswana), meaning &quot;northern people&quot; in Naro. It also goes by the names &quot;Gobabis ǃKung&quot; and &quot;Kaukau&quot; (which can take the noun class prefixes in Tswana to give &quot;Mokaukau &quot;for one person, &quot;Bakaukau&quot; for the group and &quot;Sekaukau&quot; for the language).

In Namibia, ǂKxʼaoǁʼae&quot; &quot;tends to refer literally to the ǃXuun speakers to the north in the Caprivi area. With the exception of a few cultural traits, speakers of ǂKxʼaoǁʼae&quot; &quot; and those of Juǀʼhoan both in Botswana and Namibia argue that they are one and the same people, speaking one language, with some dialectal attributes.

The non-Latin characters used by the language predominantly refer to click consonants and follow the orthography by Patrick Dickens for Juǀʼhoan.

The limited data on these dialects is poorly transcribed, but as of 2015 fieldwork is in progress.

<text>The Dalitz plot is a two-dimensional plot often used in particle physics to represent the relative frequency of various (kinematically distinct) manners in which the products of certain (otherwise similar) three-body decays may move apart.

The phase-space of a decay of a pseudoscalar into three spin-0 particles can be completely described using two variables. In a traditional Dalitz plot, the axes of the plot are the squares of the invariant masses of two pairs of the decay products. (For example, if particle A decays to particles 1, 2, and 3, a Dalitz plot for this decay could plot m212 on the x-axis and m223 on the y-axis.) If there are no angular correlations between the decay products then the distribution of these variables is flat. However symmetries may impose certain restrictions on the distribution. Furthermore, three-body decays are often dominated by resonant processes, in which the particle decays into two decay products, with one of those decay products immediately decaying into two additional decay products. In this case, the Dalitz plot will show a non-uniform distribution, with a peak around the mass of the resonant decay. In this way, the Dalitz plot provides an excellent tool for studying the dynamics of three-body decays.

Dalitz plots play a central role in the discovery of new particles in current high-energy physics experiments, including Higgs boson research, and are tools in exploratory efforts that might open avenues beyond the Standard Model. 

R.H. Dalitz introduced this technique in 1953 to study decays of K mesons (which at that time were still referred to as &quot;tau-mesons&quot;). It can be adapted to the analysis of four-body decays as well. A specific form of a four-particle Dalitz plot (for non-relativistic kinematics), which is based on a tetrahedral coordinate system, was first applied to study the few-body dynamics in atomic four-body fragmentation processes.

== Square Dalitz plot ==

Modeling of the common representation of the Dalitz plot can be complicated due to its nontrivial shape. One can however introduce such kinematic variables so that Dalitz plot gets a rectangular (or squared) shape:

formula_1;

formula_2;

where formula_3  is the invariant mass of particles 1 and 2 in a given decay event; formula_4 and formula_5  are its maximal and minimal kinematically allowed values, while formula_6  is the angle between particles 1 and 3 in the rest frame of particles 1 and 2. This technique is commonly called &quot;Square Dalitz plot&quot; (SDP).

<text>The dérive (, &quot;drift&quot;) is an unplanned journey through a landscape, usually urban, in which participants stop focusing on their everyday relations to their social environment. Developed by members of the Letterist International, it was first publicly theorized in Guy Debord&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Dérive&quot; (1956). Debord defines the &quot;dérive&quot; as &quot;a mode of experimental behaviour linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances.&quot; 

Though solo &quot;dérives&quot; are possible, Debord indicates that the most fruitful numerical arrangement consists of several small groups of two or three people who have reached the same level of awareness, since cross-checking these different groups&#x27; impressions makes it possible to arrive at more objective conclusions.The &quot;dérive&quot; goals include studying the terrain of the city (psychogeography) and emotional disorientation, both of which lead to the potential creation of Situations.

==History==
The concept of the &quot;dérive&quot; has its origins in the Letterist International, an avant-garde and Marxist collective based in Paris. The &quot;dérive&quot; was a critical tool for understanding and developing the theory of psychogeography, defined as the &quot;specific effects of the geographical environment (whether consciously organized or not) on the emotions and behavior of individuals.&quot;

The &quot;dérive&quot; continued to be a critical concept in the theories of the Situationist International, a radical group of avant-garde artists and political theorists that was formed out of the Letterist International, CoBrA, and the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus in the 1950s. For the Situationists, the &quot;dérive&quot; was a revolutionary technique to combat the malaise and boredom of the society of the spectacle.

&quot;Dérives&quot; are necessary, according to Situationist theory, because of the increasingly predictable and monotonous experience of everyday life in advanced capitalism. Debord observes in his &quot;Introduction to a Critique of Urban Geography&quot;:

In his manifesto for unitary urbanism, Raoul Vaneigem articulated some further ideas behind the &quot;dérive&quot; and the Situationist critique of space: &quot;All space is occupied by the enemy. We are living under a permanent curfew. Not just the cops — the geometry&quot;. &quot;Dérive&quot;, as a previously conceptualized tactic in the French military, was &quot;a calculated action determined by the absence of a greater locus&quot;, and &quot;a maneuver within the enemy&#x27;s field of vision&quot;. To the SI, whose interest was inhabiting space, the &quot;dérive&quot; brought appeal in this sense of taking the &quot;fight&quot; to the streets and truly indulging in a determined operation.

==Praxis==
Several groups have adopted the concept of the &quot;dérive&quot; and applied it in their own form, including many modern organizations, most notably the Loiterers Resistance Movement (Manchester), Wrights &amp; Sites, the Unilalia Group, and the Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies. Since 2003 in the United States, separate events known as the Providence Initiative for Psychogeographic Studies and Psy-Geo-Conflux have been dedicated to action-based participatory experiments similar to the &quot;dérive&quot; within the context of psychogeography.

==Technology==
A smartphone app named Dérive was developed in the 21st century by a team including Eduardo Cachucho and Babak Fakhamzadeh. The smartphone app shows a series of simple geography-based directions on a mobile device&#x27;s screen such as &quot;follow a red vehicle&quot; to create the &quot;dérive&quot; experience.

A similar application of the same name by Russian developer, Max Alyokhinc released in June 2017 does not require installation, instead working directly within a web browser. This application provides an additional mapping drift mode, where the application generates a point on the map to move to.

In March 2020, an iOS and Android app called Randonautica launched and cited Guy Debord&#x27;s essay on &quot;dérive&quot; as a core inspiration. It uses a random number generator to seed a random map location that the user is prompted to walk to while holding an intention in mind.

<doc id="714621" wikidata="Q6760262" url="?curid=714621" title="Margate Surfboat">
<text>The Margate surfboat refers to three surfboats used for maritime rescue at Margate, on the eastern tip of Kent. They were run as cooperatives, with local boatmen clubbing together to buy them and then receiving a share of any salvage money received.

The first, the &quot;Friend of all Nations&quot; was wrecked in 1860 but returned to service until 1877. Nine crew of the second boat, &quot;Friend to all Nations&quot;, died in the storm of 1897, but the boat survived both that and being lost while under tow the following year. A memorial to the nine men stands on the Margate seafront.

A third boat was built in 1899 but by then surfboats powered by oar and sail had been largely superseded by lifeboats. The third boat served as a tender at Chatham during the Second World War and was lost off Ostend in 1957. All three were built by J. Samuel White of Cowes.

==&quot;Friend of all Nations&quot;==
After the dramatic rescue in January 1857 of the crew of the &quot;Northern Belle&quot; in which the Margate lugger &quot;Victory&quot; was lost with all hands, 50 boatmen decided to establish a dedicated surfboat service for maritime rescue.

This first boat, the &quot;Friend of all Nations&quot; could be launched by four men without the need of horses and entered service in November 1857.

She was almost wrecked on 13 February 1860 attempting to rescue the crew of the Spanish brig &quot;Samaritano&quot;, which, at about 5.30am, ran onto the Margate Sands in a squall. The alarm was sounded at daybreak by the lugger &quot;Eclipse&quot;, which sent eight men onto the brig, in the hope that she could be refloated at high tide. However the gale returned and they soon gave up hope of saving the ship. The small Margate boat was launched, but in their haste they did not secure their buoyancy tanks and were driven ashore, barely afloat, in Westgate Bay. Then the &quot;Friend of all Nations&quot; was launched but it too was overpowered by the storm and was driven onshore about a mile west of Margate. Eventually all those on the remains of the &quot;Samaritano&quot; were rescued by the Ramsgate lifeboat.

The &quot;Friend&quot; was repaired and returned to service. She capsized during a rescue in January 1866 and her crew spent 85 minutes in the winter seas before they were rescued. She saved the lives of 38 men from 6 ships in the great storm of November 1877, but the damage inflicted during the rescues led to her retirement.

==&quot;Friend to all Nations&quot;==

The &quot;Friend of all Nations&quot; being unfit for further service, funds were raised for a replacement. This new boat, the &quot;Friend to all Nations&quot;, was also built at White&#x27;s and arrived in Margate on 6 July 1878.

The &quot;Friend to all Nations&quot; became famous in the great storm of 1897, which damaged much of Margate and destroyed the Switchback Railway. On the morning of 2 December 1897, thirteen men set out in the surfboat towards the struggling &quot;Persian Empire&quot;. However the &quot;Friend&quot; was hit by two waves in quick succession and capsized just off the Nayland Rock. Just four men made it to shore, of whom the medic Charles Troughton died on reaching land. The remaining nine were all beaten to a pulp on the rocks, except for Joseph Epps who was found, barely alive, underneath the capsized boat. Memorials were raised to the nine dead on the parade above Nayland Rock, and in Margate Cemetery.

Apart from the mast and rigging, the boat itself was not badly damaged and returned to service. However she was lost on the night of 30 November 1898 while under tow in the Kentish Knock. She was recovered as far away as Great Yarmouth and repaired, but was not used again.

==1899 boat==
A new boat was commissioned from White&#x27;s, which was delivered in September 1899. This much larger boat - also called &quot;Friend to all Nations&quot; - required a crew of 15 and cost £800. Improvements in lifeboats meant that she was largely restricted to local salvage work with the occasional rescue.

One of her most notable rescues was that of 26 people from the sailing ship &quot;Marechal Suchet&quot;. In 1922 she was motorised following public donations.

She continued in service at Margate until the Second World War, when she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy for service as a ship&#x27;s tender in Chatham docks.

After the war she moved to Falmouth and made her final journey in 1957 when Willi Froelich, an ex Luftwaffe war prisoner, tried to sail his family home to Germany. They got into difficulty near Ostend and were taken under tow, but the hawser snapped. After drifting for a while, the surfboat broke her bow in rough seas and sank.

<doc id="714626" wikidata="Q5349320" url="?curid=714626" title="Eileen Anderson">
<text>Eileen Anderson (October 18, 1928 – November 3, 2021) was an American politician who served as Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii from 1981 to 1985. She was the first, and as of 2024, the only woman to hold the office. A Democrat, Anderson served in various positions in the city and county and the state. She was the first Hawaii State Director of Budget and Finance.

==Early life==
Anderson attended the University of California in Los Angeles and, after moving to Hawaii with her family, graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1950 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology. Anderson married Clifford F. Anderson, a retired Honolulu Police Department major. She and her husband raised three children. After working for Hawaiian Telephone Company, the predecessor of the present-day Hawaiian Telcom, Anderson began public service in various state agencies. She found herself as the state&#x27;s first budget and finance director under Governor George Ariyoshi.

==Mayor of Honolulu==
In 1980, Anderson defeated popular incumbent Frank Fasi with seventy percent of the vote. With the unpredicted surprise landslide victory against Fasi and his notoriously powerful machine, that year Anderson was named &quot;Hawaii Business Magazine&quot; &quot;Woman of the Year 1980&quot;. Anderson served a single term at Honolulu Hale, taking office on January 2, 1981 and leaving office in 1985. Anderson&#x27;s tenure as mayor was highlighted by her promise to continue development of the island of Oahu but with fiscal responsibility.

Anderson was a member of the United States Conference of Mayors, an organization of mayors of United States cities with populations of 30,000 people or more.

===Cabinet===
Prominent members of Anderson&#x27;s administration included Bob Awana as administrative director and chief of staff, later chief of staff to Linda Lingle, the first Hawaii Republican governor after forty years of Democratic dominance in the state. Awana helped run Anderson&#x27;s failed re-election campaign against Fasi. Anderson appointed Andy Chang as managing director of Honolulu. Chang would continue to serve the city and county in various capacities after Anderson&#x27;s departure from office.

===Honolulu Area Rail Rapid Transit===
Anderson&#x27;s vow of fiscal responsibility was maintained in her cancellation of the Honolulu Area Rail Rapid Transit project, which was planned in the 1970s and close to construction approval. Popularly known as HART, the project in its original form would have built a heavy rail system with twenty-three miles of track featuring twenty-one stations from Pearl City in central Oahu to Hawaii Kai in East Oahu.

In addition to millions to be invested by the city and county, millions of dollars in grants earmarked for HART were returned by Anderson. She declined US$5.75 million from the Federal government of the United States saying, &quot;Why spend five million dollars on a system that won&#x27;t be built?&quot;

Achieving national attention, Anderson defended her position by arguing the long-term costs to taxpayers for such an expensive project, especially after U.S. President Ronald Reagan announced elimination of Federal public transit funding in the country and the ongoing need for more funding for Interstate H-3 construction. She rather argued in favor of smaller, incremental improvements to the bus system.

With growing development leading to increased traffic congestion on Oahu, the city and county continued to make public transit a focus of public debate during Anderson and Fasi&#x27;s tenures. On October 6, 1981, Anderson announced she hoped to study the San Diego Trolley, a system funded with gas taxes.

Both Anderson and Fasi continued to modernize TheBus but a rail system was never approved. It wasn&#x27;t until the 2000s that Honolulu agreed to a similar, more expensive project under the leadership of the mayor, Mufi Hannemann.

===Political defeats===
Anderson once again stood for election as mayor and was defeated by Fasi, who had switched his political affiliation from Democrat to Republican, so as to avoid being knocked out of the Democratic primary by Anderson. Anderson subsequently sought a political comeback by seeking the nomination of her party for lieutenant governor in 1986. Anderson lost the primary election to state senator Ben Cayetano, who later served alongside Hawaii Governor John Waihee before becoming governor himself.

==Popular culture==

===Perry and Price===
In 1983, KSSK-FM reformatted its morning programming pairing Michael W. Perry and Larry Price, who became two of the most popular personalities and one of the most popular radio news programs in Hawaii. Anderson was a regular listener and, a sign of Perry and Price&#x27;s growing influence, was the first major person to call the show during the broadcast, in effect signaling how relevant they were to local culture and politics.

Anderson called the radio hosts, angry about their comments over a political issue. The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; published the account on August 27, 1998:

Since Anderson&#x27;s initial call, every Mayor of Honolulu and Governor of Hawaii has appeared on the morning &quot;Perry and Price&quot; program via telephone to comment or discuss various cultural and political issues and current events.

==Women in politics==
Interested in her role as first woman to become Mayor of Honolulu, the &quot;Hawaii Kai Sun Press&quot; asked Anderson to comment on women in politics. Published on June 1, 1983, Anderson said, &quot;There is no way that we&#x27;re going to change some of the discriminatory activities that go on toward women unless we do get them involved&quot;.

Luopioinen was established during the Middle Ages, though the exact date is unclear. It remained a small village until 1693 when it acquired a chapel. At this time, Luopioinen was a part of the Hauho parish and was also known as &quot;Vesikansa&quot;. It became an independent parish in 1880, by then the alternative name &quot;Vesikansa&quot; had fallen out of use.

Aitoo was first mentioned in 1890.

Luopioinen was consolidated with Pälkäne in 2007.

=== Name ===
The name of Luopioinen comes from either a dialectal noun &quot;luopa&quot; meaning a narrow strait or from the verb &quot;luoda&quot;. It is unrelated to the word &quot;luopio&quot; meaning &quot;apostate&quot;.

<text>Clarence Josef McLin Jr. (May 31, 1921 – December 27, 1988) was an American mortician and politician who served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives for the 36th district from 1967 to 1988. His father was civil rights leader Mac McLin.

== Early life ==
McLin was born in East St. Louis, Illinois and moved with his family to Dayton, Ohio in 1931, where he attended Dunbar High School and worked at the family business, the McLin Funeral Home. As a youth, McLin filed a civil rights lawsuit against McCrory&#x27;s, a dime store at Fourth and Main streets in Dayton, for the store&#x27;s refusal to serve him because of his race.

== Career ==
McLin was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1966 and assumed office in 1967. During his 22-year-long tenure, McLin became known as a powerful member of the House. He was also a close ally of Speaker Vern Riffe. He also co-founded, with State Representative Larry G. Smith, the Black Elected Democrats of Ohio (later the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus) in 1967.

McLin was sworn in a twelfth term in 1988, but died a few days later. He was the longest-serving black legislator in Ohio history at the time of his death. His daughter, Rhine McLin was appointed to fill his seat.

== Personal life ==
He was the father of Candace Smith, an attorney, actress, model, and Miss Ohio (2003). The US 35 expressway in west Dayton, which was completed in October 1996, is designated the C. J. McLin Jr. Parkway in honor of McLin&#x27;s longtime advocacy for and work toward the construction of such a highway.

<doc id="714646" wikidata="Q181831" url="?curid=714646" title="Ciguatera fish poisoning">
<text>Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), also known as ciguatera, is a foodborne illness caused by eating reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxins. Such individual fish are said to be ciguatoxic. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, numbness, itchiness, sensitivity to hot and cold, dizziness, and weakness. The onset of symptoms varies with the amount of toxin eaten. If a large quantity of toxins are consumed symptoms may appear within half an hour. If a low amount of toxins are consumed symptoms may take a few days to appear. Diarrhea may last up to four days. Symptoms may last a few weeks to a few months. Heart problems such as slow heart rate and low blood pressure may occur.
The specific toxins involved are ciguatoxin and maitotoxin. They are originally made by a small marine organism, &quot;Gambierdiscus toxicus&quot;, that grows on and around coral reefs in tropical and subtropical waters. These are eaten by herbivorous fish which in turn are eaten by larger carnivorous fish. The toxins become more concentrated as they move up the food chain. The fish most often implicated include barracuda, grouper, moray eel, amberjack, sea bass, and sturgeon. Diagnosis is based on a person&#x27;s symptoms together with having recently eaten fish. If a number of those who eat the same fish develop symptoms the diagnosis becomes more likely. If some of the fish they had previously eaten is available this can also be tested to confirm the diagnosis.
Preventive efforts include not eating reef fish, not eating high-risk fish such as barracuda, and not eating fish liver, roe, or fish heads. Ciguatoxin has no taste or smell, and cannot be destroyed by conventional cooking. There is no specific treatment for ciguatera fish poisoning once it occurs. Mannitol may be considered, but the evidence supporting its use is not very strong. Gabapentin or amitriptyline may be used to treat some of the symptoms.
In 2017, the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that around 50,000 cases occur globally each year. Other estimates suggest up to 500,000 cases per year. The risk of death from poisoning is less than 1 in 1,000 according to the CDC. It is the most frequent seafood poisoning. It occurs most commonly in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the Caribbean Sea between the latitudes of 35°N and 35°S. The risk of the condition appears to be increasing due to coral reef deterioration and increasing trade in seafood. Descriptions of the condition date back to at least 1511. The current name, introduced in 1787, is of Cuban Spanish origin and originally referred to the gastropod &quot;Cittarium pica&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Hallmark symptoms of ciguatera in humans include gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological effects. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, usually followed by neurological symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, paresthesia, numbness of extremities, mouth and lips, reversal of hot and cold sensation, ataxia, vertigo, and hallucinations. Severe cases of ciguatera can also result in cold allodynia, which is a burning sensation on contact with cold. Neurological symptoms can persist and ciguatera poisoning is occasionally misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Cardiovascular symptoms include bradycardia, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic tachycardia, exercise intolerance, and rhythm disorders. Death from the condition can occur, but is very rare.

Dyspareunia and other ciguatera symptoms have developed in otherwise healthy males and females following sexual intercourse with partners suffering ciguatera poisoning, signifying that the toxin may be sexually transmitted. Diarrhea and facial rashes have been reported in breastfed infants of poisoned mothers, suggesting that ciguatera toxins migrate into breast milk.

The symptoms can last from weeks to years, and in extreme cases as long as 20 years, often leading to long-term disability. Most people do recover slowly over time.

==Cause==
&quot;Gambierdiscus toxicus&quot; is the primary dinoflagellate responsible for the production of a number of similar polyether toxins, including ciguatoxin, maitotoxin and possibly palytoxin. Other dinoflagellates that may cause ciguatera include &quot;Prorocentrum&quot; spp., &quot;Ostreopsis&quot; spp., &quot;Coolia&quot; spp., &quot;Thecadinium&quot; spp. and &quot;Amphidinium&quot; spp.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on a person&#x27;s symptoms together with having recently eaten fish. If a number of those who eat the same fish have symptoms the diagnosis becomes more likely. If some of the fish they had previously eaten is available this can also be tested to confirm the diagnosis. Other potential causes such as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP), scombrotoxin fish poisoning, and pufferfish poisoning should be excluded.

The reversal of hot and cold sensations is an occasional symptom of CFP that may help differentiate it from norovirus.

==Treatment==
There is no known effective treatment or antidote for ciguatera poisoning. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care. There is some evidence that calcium channel blockers like nifedipine and verapamil are effective in treating some of the symptoms that remain after the initial sickness passes, such as poor circulation and shooting pains through the chest. These symptoms are due to vasoconstriction caused by maitotoxin. Ciguatoxin lowers the threshold for opening voltage-gated sodium channels in synapses of the nervous system. Opening a sodium channel causes depolarization, which could sequentially cause paralysis, heart contraction, and changing the senses of hot and cold. Some medications such as amitriptyline may reduce some symptoms, such as fatigue and paresthesia, although benefit does not occur in every case.

===Mannitol===
Mannitol was once used for poisoning after one study reported symptom reversal. Follow-up studies in animals and case reports in humans also found benefit from mannitol. However, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial found no difference between mannitol and normal saline. Despite this its use may still be considered.

==Epidemiology==
The current estimated global incidence annually is 20,000 to 50,000 people, though a large number of cases are believed to go unreported.

Due to the limited habitats of ciguatoxin-producing microorganisms, ciguatera is common only in subtropical and tropical waters, particularly the Pacific and Caribbean, and usually is associated with fish caught in tropical reef waters. Exportation of reef fish, as well as tourism, often account for cases that develop in other regions.

Ciguatoxin is found in over 400 species of reef fish. Avoiding consumption of all reef fish is the only sure way to avoid exposure. Imported fish served in restaurants may contain the toxin and produce illness which often goes unexplained by physicians unfamiliar with the symptoms of a tropical toxin. Ciguatoxin can also occur in farm-raised salmon. Furthermore, species substitution, labeling a reef fish as a non-reef fish at restaurants and retail, can complicate efforts by consumers to avoid ciguatera.

===20th and 21st centuries===
* In 1994, Nobel-Prize winning novelist Saul Bellow nearly died from ciguatera after eating red snapper on vacation in St. Martin, fictionalized in his last novel &quot;Ravelstein&quot;.
* In 2007, ten people in St. Louis, Missouri developed the disease after eating imported fish.
* In February 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traced several outbreaks to the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, near the Texas–Louisiana shoreline. The FDA advised seafood processors that ciguatera poisoning was reasonably likely to occur from eating several species of fish caught as far as from the sanctuary.
* From August 2010 to July 2011, there were eight outbreaks of ciguatera fish poisoning in New York City. Outbreaks were linked to barracuda and grouper purchased at a fish market in Queens, New York.
* In the first quarter of 2012, two restaurants in Lanzarote, Canary Islands are thought to have been the source of ciguatera poisoning, leading to new fishing regulations issued 18 April 2012. The first outbreak was reported in February 2012. Diners suffered with vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain several hours after eating amberjack. The second case was in early April affecting six people who live in Lanzarote and had all eaten amberjack at a local restaurant.
* In March 2014, nine people were hospitalised near Macksville, New South Wales, Australia after a recreational fisherman caught a Spanish mackerel (&quot;Scomberomorus commersoni&quot;) off Scott&#x27;s Head (NSW) and then shared it among his friends and family.
* In April 2015, fourteen crew members of a potash ship were hospitalized in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada after consuming tropical fish obtained from international waters. After the incident, Marine Catering Services issued a reminder to seafarers that the UK Food Act makes it illegal for crews to fish for food from their vessels.
* In September 2016, a British holidaymaker died while on honeymoon in Mexico after consuming fish contaminated with the algae that causes ciguatera poisoning.
* During October 2016, more than 100 people suffered from ciguatera poisoning after eating fish heads supplied by an export firm in Mangalore, India.

==History==
Ciguatera was first described by one of the surgeon&#x27;s mates, William Anderson, on the crew of in 1774.

Researchers suggest that ciguatera outbreaks caused by warm climatic conditions in part propelled the migratory voyages of Polynesians between 1000 and 1400 CE.

===Folk tales===

In Northern Australia, where ciguatera is a common problem, two different folk science methods are widely believed to detect whether fish harbor significant ciguatoxin. The first method is that flies are supposed not to land on contaminated fish. The second is that cats will either refuse to eat or vomit/display symptoms after eating contaminated fish.

On Grand Cayman and other islands the locals will test barracuda by placing a piece of the fish on the ground and allowing ants to crawl on it. If the ants do not avoid the flesh and will eat it, then the fish is deemed safe.

In Dominican Republic, another common belief is that during months whose names do not include the letter &quot;R&quot; (May through August), it is not recommended to eat certain kinds of fish, because they are more likely to be infected by the ciguatera toxin.

The validity of many of these tests has been scientifically rejected.

=== Folk remedies ===
Leaves of &quot;Heliotropium foertherianum&quot; (Boraginaceae) – also known as &quot;octopus bush&quot; – are used in many Pacific islands as a traditional medicine to treat ciguatera fish poisoning. Senescent octopus bush leaves contain rosmarinic acid and derivatives, which are known for their antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Rosmarinic acid may remove the ciguatoxins from their sites of action, as well as being an anti-inflammatory.

An account of ciguatera poisoning from a linguistics researcher living on Malakula island, Vanuatu, indicates the local treatment: &quot;We had to go with what local people told us: avoid salt and any seafood. Eat sugary foods. And they gave us a tea made from the roots of ferns growing on tree trunks. I don&#x27;t know if any of that helped, but after a few weeks, the symptoms faded away&quot;.

Various Caribbean folk and ritualistic treatments originated in Cuba and nearby islands. The most common old-time remedy involves bed rest subsequent to a guanabana juice enema. In Puerto Rico, natives drink a tea made from mangrove buttons, purportedly high in B vitamins, to flush the toxic symptoms from the system. There has never been a funded study of these treatments. Other folk treatments range from directly porting and bleeding the gastrointestinal tract to &quot;cleansing&quot; the diseased with a dove during a Santería ritual.

<doc id="714653" wikidata="Q876470" url="?curid=714653" title="Gulf of Maine">
<text>The Gulf of Maine is a large gulf of the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of North America. It is bounded by Cape Cod at the eastern tip of Massachusetts in the southwest and by Cape Sable Island at the southern tip of Nova Scotia in the northeast. The gulf includes the entire coastlines of the U.S. states of New Hampshire and Maine, as well as Massachusetts north of Cape Cod, and the southern and western coastlines of the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, respectively.

The gulf was named for the adjoining English colonial Province of Maine, which was in turn likely named by early explorers after the province of Maine in France. Massachusetts Bay, Penobscot Bay, Passamaquoddy Bay, and the Bay of Fundy are all arms of the Gulf of Maine. 

==Geography and hydrography==
The Gulf of Maine is a roughly rectangular depression with a surface area of around , enclosed to the west and north by the North American mainland and communicating with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. The region&#x27;s glaciation by the Laurentide Ice Sheet stripped sedimentary soil away from the coastline, leaving a shore that is predominantly rocky and scenic, lacking the sandy beaches found to the south along the Eastern Seaboard. The only significant coastal developments are located in the Boston, Portsmouth, Portland and Saint John metropolitan areas.

The underwater features of the seabed sculpted during the lower sea levels of the ice ages make the gulf a semi-enclosed sea bounded to the south and east by underwater banks. Georges Bank in particular, on its southern end, shelters the gulf from the Gulf Stream. Gulf of Maine waters are more strongly influenced by the Labrador Current, making the gulf waters significantly colder and more nutrient-rich than those found to the south. Undersea valleys in the central basin can reach depths of , while undersea mountains rise up from the sea floor, almost reaching the surface in some locations, or even exceeding it, creating islands.

There are three major basins contained within the Gulf of Maine: Wilkinson Basin to the west, Jordan Basin in the northeast, and Georges Basin in the south, which are isolated from each other beneath the isobath. Georges Basin, just north of Georges Bank, is the deepest of the three at just over and generates a pocket at the end of the Northeast Channel, a deep fissure between Georges Bank and Browns Bank, the southwestern edge of the Scotian Shelf. The Northeast Channel is the major channel between the Gulf and the rest of the Northwest Atlantic. A secondary, shallower connection to the rest of the Atlantic is the Great South Channel, located between Georges Bank and the Nantucket Shoals.
The watershed of the gulf encompasses an area of , including all of Maine, 70% of New Hampshire, 56% of New Brunswick, 41% of Massachusetts, and 36% of Nova Scotia. The watershed also includes a small southern portion of the Canadian province of Quebec, which is less than 1% of the province&#x27;s area. Significant rivers that drain into the Gulf include, from east to west, the Annapolis, Shubenacadie, Salmon, Petitcodiac, Saint John, Magaguadavic, St. Croix, Penobscot, Kennebec, Saco, Piscataqua, Merrimack and Charles rivers; the Saint John and Penobscot have the greatest discharge.

==Ecology==
The cold waters, extreme tidal mixing, and diverse bottom of the gulf make it one of the most productive marine environments in the North Atlantic, and it furnishes habitat for more than 3,000 marine species and birds, including most notably large marine species such as haddock, pinnipeds, the Acadian redfish (&quot;Sebastes fasciatus&quot;), the Atlantic herring (&quot;Clupea harengus&quot;), and the American lobster (&quot;Homarus americanus&quot;), which grows to famously large sizes in the gulf. The biodiversity and productivity of the area are supported by kelp forest habitats that are found along the coastal zones of the gulf.

In the Gulf of Maine, different kelp macroalgae species are found at various depths. At depths less than 5 meters, &quot;Alaria esculenta&quot; is most abundant, while the &quot;Saccharina&quot; species such as &quot;S. latissima&quot; and &quot;S. digita&quot; are the species primarily seen at depths of 5–15 meters. In the deeper waters, &quot;Agarum clathratum&quot; are more abundant in the rocky subtidal zone.

The waters of the Gulf of Maine system, particularly at the boundary with the Bay of Fundy, are also home to the summering grounds for many different bird and whale species, most notably the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale. The gulf was home to the sea mink until its extinction in the late 1800s.

Water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine are rapidly rising due to human-induced climate change. Both the Labrador Current and Gulf Stream are warming, and the Gulf Stream is spreading out and delivering more water to the Gulf of Maine. As a result, it has become too warm for cod as well as kelp forests. Studies found that some areas, such as Ammen Rock Site 1, witnessed a 36.2% decrease in kelp between 1987 and 2015, while nearby shallow coastal kelp populations have been declining since the 1970s. Alongside this decline, the kelp beds have been replaced by invasive turf, defined as macroalgae that provide little three-dimensional structure but form on the bottom layers as filaments, branches, or plumes. In southwestern areas, turf is now covering 50–60% of the ocean floor. This, along with past overfishing, has helped push stocks towards collapse and hampered its recovery despite deep reductions in the number of fish caught, according to a study conducted by the Gulf of Maine Research Institute. Traditional calculations &quot;consistently over-estimated the abundance of cod.&quot; From 2004, temperatures rose by more than per year, culminating in an ocean heat wave in the northwest Atlantic in 2012–13.

Starting in the early 1990&#x27;s, to prevent further degradation of the ecosystem, a number of closed areas have been created in which certain activities are banned for some or all parts of the year.

==History and political significance==
The gulf&#x27;s relative proximity to Europe compared to other locations on the opposite side of the Atlantic made it an early destination for European colonization. French settlers founded a settlement on St. Croix Island in 1604. English settlers founded the Popham Colony on an island in the Kennebec River in 1607, the same year as the Jamestown settlement, followed by the Plymouth Colony on the shores of Massachusetts Bay in 1620. The cod fisheries that flourished in this ecosystem were able to support the Industrial Revolution occurring in Europe as well as playing a role during the 17th through early 19th century’s trade routes between Africa, the Caribbean, North America and Europe.

In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a dispute between Canada and the United States over fishing and other resource rights in the Gulf of Maine, specifically in the Georges Bank region. This dispute was taken to the International Court of Justice, which delineated a maritime boundary through the gulf in 1984. The two nations continue to disagree on the sovereignty of Machias Seal Island and the waters surrounding it in the northeastern part of the gulf. In recognition of the gulf&#x27;s importance to marine habitat, both nations currently maintain complementary embargoes against offshore oil and gas exploration activities on Georges Bank in the southern part of the gulf.

As of the past twenty years, however, traditional maritime fisheries focused on large fish species such as cod experienced a stock depletion that hurt commercial fishing. In response, harvesting of lobsters and other invertebrates rose. These changes can largely be attributed to anthropogenic factors. There has also been a rise in marine aquaculture in the area, following global trends. Such aquaculture species include Atlantic salmon, oysters, clams, mussels, and more.

<text>The Penlee lifeboat disaster occurred on 19 December 1981 off the coast of Cornwall, England. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat &quot;Solomon Browne&quot;, based at the Penlee Lifeboat Station near Mousehole, went to the aid of the vessel &quot;Union Star&quot; after its engines failed in heavy seas. After the lifeboat had rescued four people, both vessels were lost with all hands. Sixteen people died, including eight volunteer lifeboatmen.

==MV &quot;Union Star&quot;==
The MV &quot;Union Star&quot;, a mini-bulk carrier registered in Dublin, had sailed from IJmuiden in the Netherlands on 17 December with a cargo of fertiliser for its maiden voyage to Arklow, Ireland. It was carrying a crew of five: Captain Henry Morton, Mate James Whittaker, Engineer George Sedgwick, Crewman Anghostino Verressimo, and Crewman Manuel Lopes. Also on board were Morton&#x27;s wife Dawn and his teenage stepdaughters Sharon and Deanne, who had been picked up at an unauthorised call at Brightlingsea in Essex.

Near the south coast of Cornwall, east of the Wolf Rock, the ship&#x27;s engines failed. The crew was unable to restart them but did not make a mayday call. Assistance was offered by a tug, the &quot;Noord Holland&quot;, under the Lloyd&#x27;s Open Form salvage contract; Morton initially refused the offer, but accepted after consulting his owners. Winds were gusting at up to – hurricane, force 12 on the Beaufort scale – with waves up to high. The powerless ship was blown across Mount&#x27;s Bay towards the rocks of Boscawen Cove, near Lamorna.

==Rescue attempts==
===FAA Sea King helicopter===
As the ship was close to shore, the Coastguard at Falmouth summoned a Royal Navy Sea King helicopter from 820 Naval Air Squadron (who were providing cover for 771 Naval Air Squadron), RNAS Culdrose. It used the call sign &quot;Rescue 80&quot; during the mission. The aircraft was flown by LCDR Russell Smith (who was on secondment from the United States Navy), assisted by Lt Steve Marlow, S/Lt Kenneth Doherty and Leading Aircrewman Martin Kennie of the Royal Navy. They were unable to winch anyone off the ship as the wind was too violent.

===RNLB &quot;Solomon Browne&quot;===

The Coastguard had difficulties contacting the secretary of the nearest lifeboat station, Penlee Lifeboat Station at Mousehole on the west side of the bay. They eventually contacted Coxswain Trevelyan Richards and asked him to put the lifeboat on standby in case the helicopter rescue failed. He summoned the lifeboat&#x27;s volunteer crew and picked seven men to accompany him in the lifeboat: Second Coxswain and Mechanic Stephen Madron, Assistant Mechanic Nigel Brockman, Emergency Mechanic John Blewett, and crewmembers Charlie Greenhaugh, Kevin Smith, Barrie Torrie and Gary Wallis. Richards refused to take Nigel&#x27;s son Neil, as he would not take two members of the same family.

The lifeboat was the RNLB &quot;Solomon Browne&quot;, a wooden &quot;Watson&quot;-class boat built in 1960 and capable of . The lifeboat was named after Quaker Solomon Browne of Landrake following a bequest presented by his daughters. It launched at 8:12 pm and headed out through the storm to the drifting &quot;Union Star&quot;. After it had made several attempts to get alongside, four people jumped across to the lifeboat. It reported: &quot;we got four ... off ... male and female. There&#x27;s two left on board.&quot; This was the last heard from either vessel. Ten minutes later, the lifeboat&#x27;s lights disappeared.

Lt Cdr Smith USN, the pilot of the rescue helicopter, later reported that:
The greatest act of courage that I have ever seen, and am ever likely to see, was the penultimate courage and dedication shown by the Penlee [crew] when it manoeuvred back alongside the casualty in over 60 ft breakers and rescued four people shortly after the Penlee had been bashed on top of the casualty&#x27;s hatch covers. They were truly the bravest eight men I&#x27;ve ever seen, who were also totally dedicated to upholding the highest standards of the RNLI.

===Other lifeboats===
Lifeboats were summoned from , and to try to help their colleagues from Penlee. The Sennen Cove Lifeboat found it impossible to make headway round Land&#x27;s End. The Lizard Lifeboat found a serious hole in its hull when it finally returned to its slipway after a fruitless search.

==Aftermath==

In the aftermath of the disaster, wreckage from the &quot;Solomon Browne&quot; was found along the shore, and the &quot;Union Star&quot; lay capsized onto the rocks, west of Tater Du Lighthouse. Some of the 16 bodies were never recovered.

The inquiry into the disaster determined that the loss of the &quot;Union Star&quot; and its crew was because of:
# the irreparable failure of the ship&#x27;s engines due to contamination of fuel by sea water while off a dangerous lee shore;
# the extreme severity of the weather, wind and sea; and
# the capsize of the vessel on or shortly after stranding.
The loss of the &quot;Solomon Browne&quot; was:
in consequence of the persistent and heroic endeavours by the coxswain and his crew to save the lives of all from the &quot;Union Star&quot;. Such heroism enhances the highest traditions of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in whose service they gave their lives.

Coxswain Trevelyan Richards was posthumously awarded the RNLI&#x27;s gold medal, while the remainder of the crew were all posthumously awarded bronze medals. The station itself was awarded a gold medal service plaque. The disaster prompted a massive public appeal for the benefit of the village of Mousehole which raised over £3 million (equivalent to £ in ), although there was an outcry when the government tried to tax the donations.

Two nights before the disaster, Charlie Greenhaugh, who in civilian life was the landlord of the Ship Inn on the quayside in Mousehole, had turned on the village&#x27;s Christmas lights. After the storm the lights were left off but three days later his widow Mary asked for them to be repaired and lit again. The village has been lit up each December since then, but on the anniversary of the disaster they are turned off at 8:00 pm for an hour as an act of remembrance. A plaque was also erected on the Ship Inn on behalf of the tenants, managers, directors and employees of the St Austell Brewery, the pub&#x27;s owner.

Within a day of the disaster enough people from Mousehole had volunteered to form a new lifeboat crew. In 1983 a new lifeboat station (still known as &#x27;Penlee&#x27;) was opened nearby at Newlyn where a faster, larger boat could be kept moored afloat in the harbour. Neil Brockman later became the coxswain of the station&#x27;s lifeboat. The old boathouse at Penlee Point with its slipway is kept the same as it was when the lifeboat launched and a memorial garden was created beside it in 1985 to commemorate the crew of the &quot;Solomon Browne&quot;. In 2023 the boathouse, slipway, memorial garden, retaining and boundary walls were designated together a Grade II listed building. As well as architectural interest the reasons for designation cited the association with the &quot;Solomon Browne.&quot;

The Sea King helicopter involved in the rescue attempt is today preserved at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at RNAS Yeovilton, primarily because it had been flown by Prince Andrew, Duke of York during the Falklands War.

==Cultural references==
The disaster has been the subject of several songs. English folk singer and songwriter Seth Lakeman wrote the song &quot;Solomon Browne&quot;, which appears on his 2008 album &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Heaven&quot;. The CD reissue of the Anthony Phillips&#x27; album &quot;Invisible Men&quot; includes &quot;The Ballad of Penlee&quot; about the incident. Paul Sirman, a Kentish folk artist who specialises in songs of the sea recorded the incident in his song &quot;Solomon Browne&quot; which appears on his album &quot;One For All&quot;. Kimber&#x27;s Men, a sea shanty group, recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Take The Heroes&quot; on their CD of the same name. Local band Bates Motel based in Hayle included a song &quot;The Last Wave&quot;, about the disaster on their album &quot;Anorak&quot;.

In 2015, Cornish-American singer-songwriter Jim Wearne&#x27;s album &quot;Half Alive in Wallaroo&quot; featured the track &quot;The Boys of Penlee&quot;, written by fellow Cornish bard Craig Weatherhill, and featuring Weatherhill playing mellotron whose haunting choir sound ends the song with the line &quot;For those in peril on the sea&quot;, from the popular sailors&#x27; hymn. Simon Dobson wrote a test piece for brass band entitled &quot;Penlee&quot; about the incident.

Neil Oliver devotes a chapter to the disaster in his 2008 book &quot;Amazing Tales for Making Men out of Boys&quot;. It also features in his book &quot;The Story of The British Isles in 100 Places&quot;.

Great Western Railway named unit 802008 RNLB &quot;Solomon Browne&quot; in a ceremony at Penzance TMD on 13 April 2019.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary, a docudrama, &quot;Solomon Browne&quot;, written and narrated by Callum Mitchell and featuring recorded testimonies from relatives of some of the lifeboat crew, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 20 December 2021.

Also in December 2021 Mousehole FC also opened their new stand named &quot;The Solomon Browne Stand&quot;.

<doc id="714669" wikidata="Q3705101" url="?curid=714669" title="Dell'Arcano del Mare">
<text>Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare by Sir Robert Dudley is a 17th-century maritime encyclopaedia, the sixth part of which comprises a maritime atlas of the entire world, which is the first such in print, the first made by an Englishman, and the first to use the Mercator projection. The work was first published in Italian at Florence in 1645 and 1646 in three folio volumes.

Among other things, it is remarkable for its inclusion of a proposal for the construction of a navy in five rates (sizes) which Dudley designed and described. It was reprinted in Florence in a two volume folio edition in 1661 without the charts of the first edition.

==Scope==
The six-part work covered navigation, shipbuilding and astronomy, with 130 maps in two volumes (nos. 2 and 6) . Unlike the vast majority of his contemporaries, Dudley&#x27;s maps are all his own and were not copied from other mapmakers. They have an instantly recognisable style, closer to the pre-17th-century manuscript portolan charts than the richly decorated maps of Mercator, Hondius and Blaeu.

==Style==
The distinctive Baroque style of Dudley&#x27;s charts is in part attributable to the elegant engraving of Antonio Francesco Lucini.

His map making is an early use of Mercator projection.

==Individual maps==

===Carta Particolare Che Mostra Il Capo Buona Speranza===
&quot;Carta Particolare Che Mostra Il Capo Buona Speranza&quot; is a very large sea chart of southwest Africa from Cape Fria to Cape of Good Hope, including Tristan da Cunha.

===Carta Quarta Generale di Europa===
&quot;Carta Quarta Generale di Europa&quot;, 1646 is one of the larger scale, generalised (Carta Generale) maps and shows the West coast of France, southward from La Rochelle, and the Northern coast of Spain. This is the least ornate of the styles adopted by Dudley with no adornment other than the cartouche and a compass rose and fairly plain calligraphy.

===Smaller scale maps===
Four additional maps represent the majority of the smaller scale, more specific (&quot;Carta Particolare&quot;) maps and include sailing ships, notes on prevailing winds and currents and more stylised calligraphy.

===Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia===
&quot;Carta Particolare della Costa Australe scoperta dalla Ollandesia&quot;, 1646. According to Tooley, this map is the first separately printed map of Australia and is consequently of great value. It shows, in addition to the west side of the Cape York peninsula, much of the island of New Guinea. By labelling the Torres Strait &quot;Golfo Incognito&quot; Dudley leaves open the question of whether New Guinea is connected to the Southern continent.

===Carta Particolare della Rio d&#x27; Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan===
&quot;Carta Particolare della Rio d&#x27; Amazone con la costa sin al fiume Maranhan&quot; of 1646 shows the mouth of the Amazon River.

===Carta particolare che comincia con l&#x27; Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome...Clara e finisce con Il c. d&#x27; Aldeas===
&quot;Carta particolare che comincia con l&#x27; Isola di S. Tomaso o Tome...Clara e finisce con Il c. d&#x27; Aldeas&quot;. This map of the shoreline of the African Congo includes an elegant cartouche, and islands off the coastline.

===Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco===
&quot;Carta particolare della Brasilia Australe che comincia dala Poro del Spirito Santo e finisce con il capo Bianco&quot; reveals a strip of the southern Brazil coastline and includes São Paulo and the area later to become Rio de Janeiro. Noted for some of the most peculiar representations of mountains near the coastline found on any Dudley map.

French Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil.

===Untitled, (N-E South America)===
The seventh map is one of only two in the atlas which have no title but instead dedications to the Grand Duke of Tuscany and, in this case, the Grand Duchess, Dudley&#x27;s patrons. This is another double page map and probably comes from the 1646 edition. These two maps are probably different because they are the only ones where Dudley was able to use his own observations as they cover the North East coast of South America, the area he visited in 1594. This map shows the coasts of French Guiana, Guyana and a small portion of Brazil. Considerably more elaborate than the others, this map includes soundings and numerous illustrations, namely: two ships, a canoe, two magnificent sea monsters, a (?) cougar and two natives. It also has a legend stating that Monoa – more often known as El Dorado – is only 12 days&#x27; journey up-river from the coast.

<text>Captain Arnold J. Isbell, USN (September 22, 1899 – March 19, 1945) was a United States Navy officer and Naval Aviator who was killed near the end of World War II.

==Early life and career==
Isbell was born September 22, 1899, in Oto, Iowa. Raised in Logan, Iowa, he was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, in 1917, graduating and being commissioned as an ensign in 1920. He was graduated a year early because of accelerated training received during World War I. He served in various vessels in the Pacific until 1923, at which time he was ordered to duty in flight instruction. He received his wings and appointment as Naval Aviator (Seaplane) on January 11, 1924.

From 1924 to 1926 his duty involved flying in various categories, the most notable being on the Navy&#x27;s first carrier, USS &quot;Langley&quot;. From 1926 to 1929 he undertook the postgraduate course in ordnance at Annapolis, Maryland. Isbell&#x27;s duty from 1929 until 1940 when he was promoted to the rank of commander was principally concerned with flying and ordnance. He served on the original carrier &quot;Lexington&quot;, placed the carrier &quot;Ranger&quot; in commission and served on the staff of the Commander Aircraft, attached to the Battle Force. At Naval Air Station Pensacola, Isbell assumed command of Training Squadron VN-4D8 in September 1937 and Training Squadron VN-2D8 in January 1939.

==World War II service==
Prior to the actual entrance of the United States in World War II, Captain Isbell was actively engaged in operations vitally connected with the expansion of US bases. He was awarded the Air Medal for &quot;meritorious achievement while participating in aerial flight as Commanding Officer of Patrol Squadron 54 during the initial selection and survey of US Army and Navy Bases in Newfoundland in September and October 1940.&quot;

Isbell was promoted to captain in 1942 while in command of the Naval Air Station, Sitka, Alaska. In 1943, Isbell took command of the USS &quot;Card&quot;, an escort carrier, for which duty he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for a notable record of German submarine sinkings in the Central Atlantic convoy routes during World War II.

Following his successful command of the &quot;Card&quot;, Isbell was on duty with the Tenth Fleet, Anti-submarine Warfare, Navy Department, Washington, D.C., for a year. He then reported to the Pacific Fleet for assignment as Commanding Officer of USS &quot;Yorktown&quot;. It was while taking passage on USS &quot;Franklin&quot; prior to assuming command that Isbell lost his life when the carrier was hit by bombs from a Japanese plane off Okinawa on March 19, 1945.

==Namesake and honors==
The destroyer USS &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; (DD-869) was named in Captain Isbell&#x27;s honor. In addition, the Captain Arnold Jay Isbell Trophy, a US Navy award to recognize superior air antisubmarine warfare (ASW) squadrons, is also named in his honor.

<text>A webring (or web ring) is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, usually organized around a specific theme, and often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.

To be a part of the webring, each site has a common navigation bar; it contains links to the previous and next sites. By selecting next (or previous) repeatedly, the user will eventually reach the site they started at; this is the origin of the term &quot;webring.&quot; However, the select-through route around the ring is usually supplemented by a central site with links to all member sites; this prevents the ring from breaking completely if a member site goes offline.
A webring is managed from one website which is able to omit the websites that have dropped out or are no longer reachable. The advantage of a webring is that if the user is interested in the topic on one website, they can quickly connect to another website on the same topic. 
Webrings usually have a moderator who decides which pages to include in the webring. After approval, webmasters add their pages to the ring by &#x27;linking in&#x27; to the ring; this requires adding the necessary HTML or JavaScript to their site.

Sites usually join a webring in order to receive traffic from related sites. When used to improve search engine rankings, webrings can be considered a search engine optimization technique.

Webrings are mainly viewed as a relic of the early web of the 1990s. When the primary site that managed web rings, webring.org was acquired by Yahoo, &quot;ring masters&quot; lost access to their webrings and the web ring hubs were replaced by a Yahoo page. By the time Yahoo stopped controlling webring.org in 2001, search engines had become good enough that web rings were no longer as useful. The webring.org site was still active in the mid-2010s.

==WebRing.com==
Denis Howe started EUROPa (Expanding Unidirectional Ring Of Pages) at Imperial College in 1994. The idea developed further when Giraldo Hierro conceptualized a central CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script to enhance functionality. Sage Weil developed such a script in May 1994. Weil&#x27;s script gained popularity, pushing Weil in June 1995 to form a company called WebRing. In 1997, Weil sold WebRing to Starseed, Inc.

In 1998, Starseed was acquired by GeoCities, which made no major changes to the system. Just a few months later, in early 1999, Yahoo! bought GeoCities, and eighteen months after the acquisition, on September 5, 2000, Yahoo! unveiled a fully overhauled WebRing, known as Yahoo! WebRing. Although Yahoo!&#x27;s implementation was meant to streamline the way the rings were managed and provide a more consistent interface for all rings, many of these changes were unpopular with ringmasters accustomed to the older system which gave them more flexibility.

On April 15, 2001, Yahoo! ended its support of WebRing, leaving the site in the hands of one technician from the original WebRing, Timothy Killeen. On October 12, 2001, he unveiled a WebRing no longer affiliated with Yahoo!. In the years since that change, many of the features which had been stripped by Yahoo!, particularly customization options, were re-implemented into the WebRing system.

On September 26, 2006, WebRing Inc. announced a new WebRing Premium Membership Program. Memberships were separated into two types, WebRing 1.0 and WebRing 2.0. Sites that were part of WebRing 1.0 would be limited to 50 webrings per URL. Existing 1.0 members could maintain more than 50, but can not add more. In conjunction with the premium membership program, WebRing introduced an affiliate program, in which webmasters earned money when others join webrings from their site, and they earned an additional payment if the new member purchases a premium membership.

In early October 2007, the US Trademark office granted WebRing a trademark on its name. Also in that month, Yahoo!&#x27;s long partnership ended, when WebRing ownership repurchased WebRing stock held by Yahoo!, marking the first time since the late 1990s that WebRing was privately held.

By August 15, 2020, webring.com became inaccessible, and as of December 18, 2021, the domain name has been taken over by a domain squatter.

==Other webring websites==
An alternative website is Webringo.com, run as a hobby by the RingMaster. The first &quot;webringo&quot; first appeared in the Internet Archive in September 2006, but failed in September 2011.
The present RingMaster took it over as a hobby in August 2012, and then went down somewhere in March 2024.

Alt-webring.com used the Ringlink (Free CGI Perl program for running webrings). 
The first &quot;Alt-webring&quot; first appeared in the Internet Archive in April 2003. Alt-webring.com has since closed and has been taken over by a domain squatter.

RingSurf.com uses the term &#x27;Net Rings&#x27;. The site first appeared in the Internet Archive in June 1998. The site&#x27;s main page and directory of rings are still operating as of January 2024, but the rings&#x27; sites are inaccessible.

==Webring software==
While the largest webring services use their own proprietary software, a few programs have been written that make it possible for webmasters to run webrings without being dependent on an off-site service. Ringlink, SimpleRing, PHP-Ring, and Ringmaker are some examples.

<doc id="714694" wikidata="Q1788657" url="?curid=714694" title="Northern England">
<text>Northern England, or the North of England, refers to the northern part of England and mainly corresponds to the historic counties of Cheshire, Cumberland, Durham, Lancashire, Northumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire. Officially, it is a grouping of three statistical regions: the North East, the North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber, which had a combined population of 15.5 million at the 2021 census, an area of and 17 cities.

Northern England is culturally and economically distinct from both the Midlands and Southern England. The area&#x27;s northern boundary is the border with Scotland, its western the Irish Sea and a short border with Wales, and its eastern the North Sea. Its southern border is often debated, and there has been controversy in defining what geographies or cultures precisely constitute the &#x27;North of England&#x27; — if, indeed, it exists as a coherent entity at all. 

The region corresponds to the borders of the sub-Roman Brythonic Celtic territory of Yr Hen Ogledd (the Old North), as well as the medieval Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. Many Industrial Revolution innovations began in Northern England, and its cities were the crucibles of many of the political changes that accompanied this social upheaval, from trade unionism to Manchester Liberalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the economy of the North was dominated by heavy industry. Centuries of immigration, invasion, and labour have shaped Northern England&#x27;s culture, and it has retained countless distinctive accents and dialects, music, arts, and cuisine. Industrial decline in the second half of the 20th century damaged the North, leading to greater deprivation than in the South. Although urban renewal projects and the transition to a service economy have resulted in strong economic growth in parts of the North, the North–South divide remains in both the economy and culture of England.
==Definitions==
For government and statistical purposes, Northern England is defined as the area covered by the three northernmost statistical regions of England: North East England, North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber. This area consists of the ceremonial counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, County Durham, East Riding of Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside, Northumberland, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire, plus the unitary authority areas of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire within the ceremonial county Lincolnshire.

Other definitions use historic county boundaries, in which case the North is generally taken to comprise Cumberland, Northumberland, Westmorland, County Durham, Lancashire and Yorkshire, often supplemented by Cheshire. The boundary is sometimes drawn without reference to human borders, using geographic features such as the River Mersey (the line between the Humber and Mersey estuaries being a common boundary) and River Trent. The Isle of Man is occasionally included in broad geographical definitions of &quot;the North&quot; (for example, by the Survey of English Dialects, VisitBritain and BBC North West), although it is politically and culturally distinct from England.

Some areas of Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Staffordshire have northern characteristics and include satellites of northern cities. Towns in the High Peak borough of Derbyshire are included in the Greater Manchester Built-Up Area, as villages and hamlets there such as Tintwistle, Crowden and Woodhead were formerly in Cheshire before local government boundary changes in 1974, due to their close proximity to the city of Manchester, and before this the borough was considered to be part of the Greater Manchester Statutory City Region. More recently, the Chesterfield, North East Derbyshire, Bolsover, and Derbyshire Dales districts have joined with districts of South Yorkshire to form the Sheffield City Region, along with the Bassetlaw District of Nottinghamshire, although for all other purposes these districts still remain in their respective East Midlands counties. Some parts of northern Derbyshire (including High Peak), Shropshire and Staffordshire are served by BBC North West. Some areas of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire are served by BBC Yorkshire (formerly BBC North), whilst eastern Yorkshire shares its BBC region with Lincolnshire and small parts of Nottinghamshire and north west Norfolk. The historic part of Lincolnshire known as Lindsey (in essence the northern half of the county) is considered by many to be northern, or at least a larger part of Lincolnshire than merely the north and northeast Lincolnshire districts. The geographer Danny Dorling includes most of the West Midlands and part of the East Midlands in his definition of the North, claiming that &quot;ideas of a midlands region add more confusion than light&quot;. 

Conversely, more restrictive definitions of Northern England also exist. Some are based on the extent of the historical Northumbria, which excludes Cheshire and northern Lincolnshire, though the latter formed the Kingdom of Lindsey, which was periodically under Northumbrian rule. The Redcliffe-Maud Report (1969) proposed that southern Cheshire be grouped with north Staffordshire as part of a West Midlands province as opposed to a North West England one. Occasionally, &quot;Northern England&quot; may be used to describe England&#x27;s northernmost reaches only, broadly the North East and Cumbria, excluding the entirety, or at least the majority, of Lancashire and Yorkshire. Some settlements, including Sheffield, located in the far south of what would typically be defined as &quot;the North&quot;, have been referred to as being in the &quot;North Midlands&quot; as opposed to &quot;the North&quot;.

Personal definitions of the North vary greatly. When asked to draw a dividing line between North and South, Southerners tend to draw this line further south than Northerners do. From the Southern perspective, Northern England is sometimes defined jokingly as the area north of the Watford Gap between Northampton and Leicester – a definition which would include much of the Midlands. Various cities and towns have been described as or promoted themselves as the &quot;gateway to the North&quot;, including Crewe, Stoke-on-Trent, and Sheffield. For some in the northernmost reaches of England, the North starts somewhere in North Yorkshire around the River Tees – the Yorkshire poet Simon Armitage suggests Thirsk, Northallerton or Richmond – and does not include cities like Manchester and Leeds, nor the majority of Yorkshire. Northern England is not a homogeneous unit, and some have entirely rejected the idea that the North exists as a coherent entity, claiming that considerable cultural differences across the area overwhelm any similarities.

==Geography and cities==
The Pennines, an upland range sometimes referred to as &quot;the backbone of England&quot; run through most of the area defined as northern England, which stretches from the Tyne Gap to the Peak District. Other uplands in the North include the Lake District with England&#x27;s highest mountains, the Cheviot Hills adjoining the border with Scotland, and the North York Moors near the North Sea coastline. 

The geography of the North has been heavily shaped by the ice sheets of the Pleistocene era, which often reached as far south as the Midlands. Glaciers carved deep, craggy valleys in the central uplands, and, when they melted, deposited large quantities of fluvio-glacial material in lowland areas like the Cheshire and Solway Plains. On the eastern side of the Pennines, a former glacial lake forms the Humberhead Levels: a large area of fenland which drains into the Humber and which is very fertile and productive farmland.
Much of the mountainous upland remains undeveloped, and of the ten national parks in England, five – the Peak District, the Lake District, the North York Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, and Northumberland National Park – are located partly or entirely in the North. The Lake District includes England&#x27;s highest peak, Scafell Pike, which rises to , its largest lake, Windermere, and its deepest lake, Wastwater. Northern England is one of the most treeless areas in Europe, and to combat this the government plans to plant over 50 million trees in a new Northern Forest.

===Urban===
Uniquely for such a large urban belt in Europe, the cities in this region are all as recent as the Industrial Revolution – most of them previously scattered villages. Vast urban areas have emerged along the coasts and rivers, and they run almost contiguously into each other in places. Near the east coast, trade fuelled the growth of major ports and settlements (Kingston upon Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne, Middlesbrough and Sunderland) to create multiple urban areas. Inland needs of trade and industry produced an almost continuous urbanisation from the Wirral Peninsula to Doncaster, taking in the cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield, with a population of at least 7.6 million.

Analysis by The Northern Way in 2006 found that 90% of the population of the North lived in and around: Liverpool, Central Lancashire, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Hull and Humber Ports, Tees Valley and Tyne and Wear. At the 2011 census, 86% of the Northern population lived in urban areas as defined by the Office for National Statistics, compared to 82% for England as a whole.
Due to differing definitions and city limits, the list of largest towns and cities may be misleading. For example while Manchester is ranked fourth as a city, the greater urban area it leads (Greater Manchester Built-up Area) is the largest in the region and larger than Leeds&#x27;s urban area (West Yorkshire Built-up Area) despite Leeds being the largest as a sole city. The table below shows the urban areas in the region with a population of at least 250,000.
===Natural resources===
Peat is found in thick, plentiful layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, and there are many large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. Millstone grit, a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.

Rich deposits of iron ore are found in Cumbria and the North East, and fluorspar and baryte are also plentiful in northern parts of the Pennines. Salt mining in Cheshire has a long history, and both remaining rock salt mines in Great Britain are in the North: Winsford Mine in Cheshire and Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire, which also produces half of the UK&#x27;s potash.

===Climate===

Northern England has a cool, wet oceanic climate with small areas of subpolar oceanic climate in the uplands. Averaged across the entire region, Northern England temperature range and sunshine duration is similar to the UK average and it sees substantially less rainfall than Scotland or Wales. It is cooler, wetter and cloudier than England as a whole, containing both England&#x27;s coldest (Cross Fell) and rainiest point (Seathwaite Fell). These averages disguise considerable variation across the region, due chiefly to the upland regions and adjacent seas.

The prevailing winds across the British Isles are westerlies bringing moisture from the Atlantic; this means that the west coast frequently receives strong winds and heavy rainfall while the east coast lies in a rain shadow behind the Pennines. As a result the coast north of the Humber are the driest parts of the North, the Tees basin has of rain per year while parts of the Lake District receive over . Lowland regions in the more southern parts of Northern England (such as Cheshire and South Yorkshire) are the warmest with average maximum July temperatures of over : the highest points in the Pennines and Lake District reach only . The North has a reputation for cloud and fog – with the west&#x27;s high average rainfall and the east coast experiences a distinctive sea fret. Smog in urban areas was prevalent from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution; sunshine duration has increased in urban areas in recent years with the Clean Air Act 1956 and the area&#x27;s heavy industry in decline.
==Language and dialect==
===English===
====Dialect====
The English spoken today in the North has been shaped by the area&#x27;s history, and some dialects retain features inherited from Old Norse and the local Celtic languages. They are a dialectal continuum, middle areas that have a crossover between varieties spoken, around the North. Traditional dialectal areas are defined by their historic county or combined historic counties; including Cumbrian (Cumberland and Westmorland), Lancastrian (Lancashire), Northumbrian (Northumberland and Durham) and Tyke (Yorkshire). During the Industrial Revolution urban areas gained some or further distinction from traditional dialects; such as areas Mackem (Wearside), Mancunian (Manchester), Pitmatic (Great Northern Coalfield), Geordie (Tyneside), Smoggie (Teesside), Scouse (Liverpool) and around Hull. 

Linguists have attempted to define a Northern dialect area, some correspond the area north of a line that begins at the Humber estuary and runs up the River Wharfe and across to the River Lune in north Lancashire. This area corresponds roughly to the &quot;sprachraum&quot; of the Old English Northumbrian dialect, although the linguistic elements that defined this area in the past, such as the use of &quot;doon&quot; instead of &quot;down&quot; and substitution of an &quot;ang&quot; sound in words that end -&quot;ong&quot; (&quot;lang&quot; instead of &quot;long&quot;), are now prevalent only in the more northern parts of the region. As speech has changed, there is little consensus on what defines a &quot;Northern&quot; accent or dialect.

Northern English accents have not undergone the – split, and a common shibboleth to distinguish them from Southern ones is the Northern use of the short a (the near-open front unrounded vowel) in words such as &quot;bath&quot; and &quot;castle&quot;. On the opposite border, most Northern English accents can be distinguished from Scottish accents because they are non-rhotic, although some Lancashire and Northumberland accents remain rhotic. Other features common to many Northern English accents are the absence of the – split (so &quot;put&quot; and &quot;putt&quot; are homophones), the reduction of the definite article &quot;the&quot; to a glottal stop (usually represented in writing as &quot;t″&quot; or occasionally &quot;th″&quot;, although it is often not pronounced as a /t/ sound) or its total elision, and the T-to-R rule that leads to the pronunciation of &quot;t&quot; as a rhotic consonant in phrases like &quot;get up&quot; ().

The pronouns &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; survive in some Northern English dialects, although these are dying out outside very rural areas, and many dialects have an informal second-person plural pronoun: either &quot;ye&quot; (common in the North East) or &quot;&quot; (common in areas with historical Irish communities). Many dialects use &quot;&quot; as a possessive (&quot;me car&quot;) and some treat &quot;&quot; likewise (&quot;us cars&quot;) or use the alternative &quot;&quot; (&quot;wor cars&quot;). Possessive pronouns are also used to mark the names of relatives in speech (for example, a relative called Joan would be referred to as &quot;our Joan&quot; in conversation).

With urbanisation, distinctive urban accents have arisen which often differ greatly from the historical accents of the surrounding rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain an important part of the culture of the region, and the desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.

====Literature====

The contrasting geography of Northern England is reflected in its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: the poetry of William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters are perhaps the most famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children&#x27;s literature such as &quot;The Railway Children&quot; (1906), &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1911) and &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the Poets Laureate Ted Hughes and Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage of the sounds and rhythms of Northern English dialects.

Meanwhile, the industrialising and urbanising cities of the North gave rise to many masterpieces of social realism. Elizabeth Gaskell was the first in a lineage of female realist writers from the North that later included Winifred Holtby, Catherine Cookson, Beryl Bainbridge and Jeanette Winterson. Many of the angry young men of post-war literature were Northern, and working-class life in the face of deindustrialisation is depicted in novels such as &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1959), &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1959), &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1960) and &quot;A Kestrel for a Knave&quot; (1968).

===Other languages===
There are no recognised minority languages in Northern England, although the Northumbrian Language Society campaigns to have the Northumbrian dialect recognised as a separate language. It is possible that traces of now-extinct Brythonic Celtic languages from the region survive in some rural areas in the Yan Tan Tethera counting systems traditionally used by shepherds.

Contact between English and immigrant languages has given rise to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in the country as a whole have strongholds in Northern towns: Bradford for instance has the largest proportion of Pashto speakers, while Manchester has most Cantonese speakers.

==History==
===The prehistoric North===

During the ice ages, Northern England was buried under ice sheets, and little evidence remains of habitation – either because the climate made the area uninhabitable, or because glaciation destroyed most evidence of human activity. The northernmost cave art in Europe is found at Creswell Crags in northern Derbyshire, near modern-day Sheffield, which shows signs of Neanderthal inhabitation 50 to 60 thousand years ago, and of a more modern occupation known as the Creswellian culture around 12,000 years ago. Kirkwell Cave in Lower Allithwaite, Cumbria shows signs of the Federmesser culture of the Paleolithic, and was inhabited some time between 13,400 and 12,800 years ago.

Significant settlement appears to have begun in the Mesolithic era, with Star Carr in North Yorkshire generally considered the most significant monument of this era. The Star Carr site includes Britain&#x27;s oldest known house, from around 9000 BC, and the earliest evidence of carpentry in the form of a carved tree trunk from 11000 BC.

The Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds around the Humber Estuary were settled and farmed in the Bronze Age, and the Ferriby Boats – one of the best-preserved finds of the era – were discovered near Hull in 1937. In the more mountainous regions of the Peak District, hillforts were the main Bronze Age settlement and the locals were most likely pastoralists raising livestock.

===Iron Age and the Romans===

Roman histories name the Celtic tribe that occupied the majority of Northern England as the Brigantes, likely meaning &quot;Highlanders&quot;. Whether the Brigantes were a unified group or a looser federation of tribes around the Pennines is debated, but the name appears to have been adopted by the inhabitants of the region, which was known by the Romans as Brigantia. Other tribes mentioned in ancient histories, which may have been part of the Brigantes or separate nations, are the Carvetii of modern-day Cumbria and the Parisi of east Yorkshire.

The Brigantes allied with the Roman Empire during the Roman conquest of Britain: Tacitus records that they handed the resistance leader Caratacus over to the Empire in 51. Power struggles within the Brigantes made the Romans wary, and they were conquered in a war beginning in the 70s under the governorship of Quintus Petillius Cerialis. The Romans created the province of &quot;Britannia Inferior&quot; (Lower Britain) in the North, and it was ruled from the city of Eboracum (modern York). Eboracum and Deva Victrix (modern Chester) were the main legionary bases in the region, with other smaller forts including Mamucium (Manchester) and Cataractonium (Catterick). Britannia Inferior extended as far north as Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, which was the northernmost border of the Roman Empire. Although the Romans invaded modern-day Northumberland and part of Scotland beyond it, they never succeeded in conquering the reaches of Britain beyond the River Tyne.

===Anglo-Saxons and Vikings===
After the end of Roman rule in Britain and the arrival of the Angles, Yr Hen Ogledd (the &quot;Old North&quot;) was divided into rival kingdoms, Bernicia, Deira, Rheged and Elmet. Bernicia covered lands north of the Tees, Deira corresponded roughly to the eastern half of modern-day Yorkshire, Rheged to Cumbria, and Elmet to the western-half of Yorkshire. Bernicia and Deira were first united as Northumbria by Aethelfrith, a king of Bernicia who conquered Deira around the year 604. Northumbria then saw a Golden Age in cultural, scholarly and monastic activity, centred on Lindisfarne and aided by Irish monks. The north-west of England retains vestiges of a Celtic culture, and had its own Celtic language, Cumbric, spoken predominately in Cumbria until around the 12th century.

Parts of the north and east of England were subject to Danish control (the Danelaw) during the Viking Age, but the northern part of the old Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria remained under Anglo-Saxon control. Under the Vikings, monasteries were largely wiped out, and the discovery of grave goods in Northern churchyards suggests that Norse funeral rites replaced Christian ones for a time. Viking control of certain areas, particularly around Yorkshire, is recalled in the etymology of many place names: the &quot;thorpe&quot; in town names such as Cleethorpes and Scunthorpe, the &quot;kirk&quot; in Kirklees and Ormskirk and the &quot;&quot; of Whitby and Grimsby all have Norse roots.

===Norman Conquest and the Middle Ages===

The 1066 defeat of the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada by the Anglo-Saxon Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Stamford Bridge near York marked the beginning of the end of Viking rule in England, and the almost immediate defeat of Godwinson at the hands of the Norman William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings was in turn the overthrow of the Anglo-Saxon order. The Northumbrian and Danish aristocracy resisted the Norman Conquest, and to put an end to the rebellion, William ordered the Harrying of the North. In the winter of 1069–1070, towns, villages and farms were systematically destroyed across much of Yorkshire as well as northern Lancashire and County Durham. The region was gripped by famine and much of Northern England was deserted. Chroniclers at the time reported a hundred thousand deaths – modern estimates place the total somewhere in the tens of thousands, out of a population of two million. When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, much of Northern England was still recorded as wasteland, although this may have been in part because the chroniclers, more interested in manorial farmland, paid little attention to pastoral areas.
Following Norman subjugation, monasteries returned to the North as missionaries sought to &quot;settle the desert&quot;. Monastic orders such as the Cistercians became significant players in the economy of Northern England – the Cistercian Fountains Abbey in North Yorkshire became the largest and richest of the Northern abbeys, and would remain so until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Other Cistercian abbeys are at Rievaulx, Kirkstall and Byland. The 7th-century Whitby Abbey was Benedictine and Bolton Abbey, Augustinian. A significant Flemish immigration followed the conquest, which likely populated much of the desolated regions of Cumbria, and which was persistent enough that the town of Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire still had an ethnic enclave called Flemingate in the thirteenth century.

During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England and took much of the land north of the Tees. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria, as well as part of Lancashire. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing for the most part the modern England–Scotland border. The region also saw violence during The Great Raid of 1322 when Robert the Bruce invaded and raided the whole of Northern England. There was also the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day conception of the war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic – Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, even requiring mercenaries from Scotland and France, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, and in just 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed – now the northernmost town in England – changed hands more than a dozen times. The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle south of the border, chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire.

===Early modern era===

After the English Reformation, the North saw several Catholic uprisings, including the Lincolnshire Rising, Bigod&#x27;s Rebellion in Cumberland and Westmorland, and largest of all, the Yorkshire-based Pilgrimage of Grace, all against Henry VIII. His daughter Elizabeth I faced another Catholic rebellion, the Rising of the North. The region would become the centre of recusancy as prominent Catholic families in Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire refused to convert to Protestantism. Royal power over the region was exercised through the Council of the North at King&#x27;s Manor, York, which was founded in 1484 by Richard III. The Council existed intermittently for the next two centuries – its final incarnation was created in the aftermath of the Pilgrimage of Grace and was chiefly an institution for providing order and dispensing justice.

Northern England was a focal point for fighting during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The border counties were invaded by Scotland in the Second Bishops&#x27; War, and at the 1640 Treaty of Ripon King Charles I was forced to temporarily cede Northumberland and County Durham to the Scots and pay to keep the Scottish armies there. To raise enough funds and ratify the final peace treaty, Charles had to call what became the Long Parliament, beginning the process that led to the First English Civil War. In 1641, the Long Parliament abolished the Council of the North for perceived abuses during the Personal Rule period. By the time war broke out in 1642, King Charles had moved his court to York, and Northern England was to become a major base of the Royalist forces until they were routed at the Battle of Marston Moor.

===Industrial Revolution===

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practised on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.
The Great Famine in Ireland of the 1840s drove migrants across the Irish Sea, and many settled in the industrial cities of the North, especially Manchester and Liverpool – at the 1851 census, 13% of the population of Manchester and Salford were Irish-born, and in Liverpool the figure was 22%. In response there was a wave of anti-Catholic riots and Protestant Orange Orders proliferated across Northern England, chiefly in Lancashire, but also elsewhere in the North. By 1881 there were 374 Orange organisations in Lancashire, 71 in the North East, and 42 in Yorkshire. From further afield, Northern England saw immigration from European countries such as Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia and Scandinavia. Some immigrants were well-to-do industrialists seeking to do business in the booming industrial cities, some were escaping poverty, some were servants or slaves, some were sailors who chose to settle in the port towns, some were Jews fleeing pogroms on the continent, and some were migrants originally stranded at Liverpool after attempting to catch an onwards ship to the United States or to colonies of the British Empire. At the same time, hundreds of thousands from depressed rural areas of the North emigrated, chiefly to the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

===Deindustrialisation and modern history===

The First World War was the turning point for the economy of Northern England. In the interwar years, the Northern economy began to be eclipsed by the South – in 1913–1914, unemployment in &quot;outer Britain&quot; (the North, plus Scotland and Wales) was 2.6% while the rate in Southern England was more than double that at 5.5%, but in 1937 during the Great Depression the outer British unemployment rate was 16.1% and the Southern rate was less than half that at 7.1%. The weakening economy and interwar unemployment caused several episodes of social unrest in the region, including the 1926 general strike and the Jarrow March. The Great Depression highlighted the weakness of Northern England&#x27;s specialised economy: as world trade declined, demand for ships, steel, coal and textiles all fell. For the most part, Northern factories were still using nineteenth-century technology, and were not able to keep up with advances in industries such as motors, chemicals and electricals, while the expansion of the electric grid removed the North&#x27;s advantages in terms of power generation and meant it was now more economic to build new factories in the Midlands or South.

The industrial concentration in Northern England made it a major target for Luftwaffe attacks during the Second World War. The Blitz of 1940–1941 saw major raids on Barrow-in-Furness, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Merseyside, Newcastle and Sheffield with thousands killed and significant damage done. Liverpool, a vital port for supplies from North America, was especially hard hit – the city was the most bombed in the UK outside London and Hull, with around 4,000 deaths across Merseyside and most of the city centre destroyed. Hull, the worst bombed city outside of London suffered damage to 98% of all buildings, the highest percentage of any town or city. The rebuilding that followed, and the simultaneous slum clearance that saw whole neighbourhoods demolished and rebuilt, transformed the faces of Northern cities. Immigration from the &quot;New Commonwealth&quot;, especially Pakistan and Bangladesh, starting in the 1950s reshaped Northern England once more, and there are now significant populations from the Indian subcontinent in towns and cities such as Bradford, Leeds, Preston and Sheffield.

Deindustrialisation continued and unemployment gradually increased during the 1970s, but accelerated during the government of Margaret Thatcher, who chose not to encourage growth in the North if it risked growth in the South. The era saw the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike, which brought hardship for many Northern mining towns. Northern metropolitan county councils, which were Labour strongholds often with very left-wing leadership (such as Militant-dominated Liverpool and the so-called &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of South Yorkshire&quot;), had high-profile conflicts with the national government. The increasing awareness of the North–South divide strengthened the distinct Northern English identity, which, despite regeneration in some of the major cities, remains to this day.

The region saw several IRA attacks during the Troubles, including the M62 coach bombing, the Warrington bomb attacks and the 1992 and 1996 Manchester bombings. The latter was the largest bomb detonation in Great Britain since the end of the Second World War, and damaged or destroyed much of central Manchester. The attack led to Manchester&#x27;s ageing infrastructure being rebuilt and modernised, sparking the regeneration of the city and making it a leading example of post-industrial redevelopment followed by other cities in the region and beyond.

==Demographics==

At the 2021 census, Northern England had a population of 15,550,000, in 6,659,700 households. This is an increase from the 14,933,000 (and 6,364,000 households) counted in the 2011 census, and itself a growth of 5.1% from 2001. This means that Northerners comprise 28% of the English population and 24% of the UK population.

Taken overall, 8% of the population of Northern England were born overseas (3% from the European Union including Ireland and 5% from elsewhere), substantially less than the England and Wales average of 13%, and 5% define their nationality as something other than a UK or Irish identity. 90.5% of the population described themselves as white, compared to an England and Wales average of 85.9%; other ethnicities represented include Pakistani (2.9%), Indian (1.3%), Black (1.3%), Chinese (0.6%) and Bangladeshi (0.5%). The broad averages hide significant variation within the region: Allerdale and Redcar and Cleveland had a greater percentage of the population identifying as White British (97.6% each) than any other district in England and Wales, while Manchester (66.5%), Bradford (67.4%) and Blackburn with Darwen (69.1%) had among the lowest proportions of White British outside London.

===Languages===

95% of the Northern population speak English as a first language – compared to an England and Wales average of 92% – and another 4% speak English as a second language well or very well. The 5% of the population who have another native language are chiefly speakers of European or South Asian languages. At the 2011 census, the largest languages apart from English were Polish (spoken by 0.7% of the population), Urdu (0.6%) and Punjabi (0.5%), and 0.4% of the population speak a variety of Chinese: a similar distribution to that in the whole of England. Redcar and Cleveland has the largest proportion of the population speaking English as a first language in England, with 99.3%.

===Religion===
At the 2011 census, the North East and North West had the largest proportion of Christians in England and Wales; 67.5% and 67.3% respectively (the proportion in Yorkshire and the Humber was lower at 59.5%). Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West both had significant populations of Muslims – 6.2% and 5.1% respectively – while Muslims in the North East made up only 1.8% of the population. All other faiths combined comprised less than 2% of the population in all regions.

The census question on religion has been criticised by the British Humanist Association as leading, and other surveys of religion tend to find very different results. The 2015 British Election Survey found 52% of Northerners identified as Christian (22% Anglican, 14% non-denominational Christian, 12% Roman Catholic, 2% Methodist, and 2% other Christian denominations), 40% as non-religious, 5% as Muslim, 1% as Hindu and 1% as Jewish.

===Health===

One major manifestation of the North–South divide is in health and life expectancy statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease, respiratory disease and obesity. Blackpool has the lowest life expectancy at birth in England – male life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – and the majority of English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991 and 1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increases in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.

These health inequalities manifested during the COVID-19 pandemic in high infection rates, death rates and excess mortality in Northern England, and in severe job losses in the following Great Lockdown recession. By June 2020, the infection rate in Northern England was nearly double that in London, and a study by the Northern Health Science Alliance found that of the six worst affected areas in England during the pandemic in their study, five were located in the North.

==Education==

Before the 19th century, there were no universities in Northern England. The first was the University of Durham, founded in 1832. The next universities built in the North were part of the wave of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with Durham being joined by five redbrick university institutions (all in the Russell Group of leading research universities): Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sheffield. These six, plus the plateglass universities of York (also in the Russell Group) and Lancaster, form the N8 Research Partnership. The universities of Central Lancashire, Salford and Teesside are part of the University Alliance. Other universities in the North include Bolton, Bradford, Chester, Cumbria, Edge Hill, Huddersfield, Hull, Leeds Trinity, Leeds Arts, Liverpool Hope, Liverpool John Moores, Manchester Metropolitan, Northumbria, Sheffield Hallam, Sunderland and York St John.

There is a significant attainment gap between Northern and Southern schools, and pupils in the three regions are less likely than the national average to achieve five higher-tier GCSEs, although this may be down to economic disadvantages faced by Northern pupils rather than a difference in school quality. Northern students are under-represented at Oxbridge, where three times as many places go to southerners as to northerners, and at other Southern universities; while southerners are under-represented at leading Northern universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. There are calls for the government to invest in education in disadvantaged parts of Northern England to redress the disparities in educational attainment and university admissions between north and south.

==Economy==
Like the UK as a whole, the Northern English economy is now dominated by the service sector – in September 2016, 82.2% of workers in the Northern statistical regions were employed in services, compared to 83.7% for the UK as a whole. Manufacturing now employs 9.5%, compared to the national average of 7.6%. The unemployment rate in Northern England is 5.3% compared to an England-wide and UK-wide average of 4.8%, and the North East has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 7.0% in December 2016, more than one percentage point higher than any other region. In 2015, the gross value added (GVA) of the Northern English economy was £316 billion, and if it were an independent nation, it would be the tenth largest economy in Europe. The region does have poor growth and productivity rates compared to Southern England and to other EU countries.

Growth, employment and household income have lagged behind the South, and the five most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The picture is not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire&#x27;s Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire&#x27;s Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam is one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just on the other side of the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity.

The decline of coal mining and manufacturing in Northern England has led to comparisons with the Rust Belt in the United States. To stimulate the Northern economy, the government has organised a series of programmes to invest in and develop the region, of which the latest as of 2017 is the Northern Powerhouse. The North has also been a significant recipient of European Union Structural Funds. Between 2007 and 2013, EU funds created around 70,000 jobs in the region, and the majority of Northern Powerhouse funding comes from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Investment Bank. The loss of these funds following Brexit, combined with potential reductions in exports to the EU, has been identified as a threat to Northern growth.

===Public sector===
The public sector is a major employer in Northern England. Between 2000 and 2008, the majority of new jobs created in Northern England were for the government and its suppliers and contractors. All three Northern regions have public sector employment above the national average, and North East has the highest level in England with 20.2% of the workforce in the public sector as of 2016 – down from 23.4% a decade earlier. The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.

===Agriculture and fisheries===

There are of farmland in Northern England. The rough Pennine terrain means that most of Northern England is unsuited for growing crops; like Scotland, Northern farming was traditionally dominated by oats, which grow better than wheat in poor soil. Today, the mix of cereals and vegetables grown is similar to that of the UK as a whole, but only a minority of land is arable. Only 32% of Northern farmland is primarily used for growing crops, compared to 49% for England as a whole. Conversely, 57% of the land is given over to rearing livestock, and 33% of England&#x27;s cattle, 43% of its pigs and 46% of its sheep and lambs are reared in the North.

The only part of the region that is predominantly given over to crops is the land around the Humber estuary, where the well-drained fens result in excellent quality land. The lowland Cheshire Plain is mostly given over to dairy farming, while in the Pennines and Cheviots grazing sheep play an important role not just in agriculture but also in land management more generally. Heather moorland in the Pennine uplands is home to driven grouse shooting from 12 August (the Glorious Twelfth) until 10 December every year. The number of grouse moors in Northern England is a major threat to natural predators, which are often killed by gamekeepers to protect grouse, and as a result, the Cumbria Wildlife Trust describes the North&#x27;s moors as a &quot;black hole&quot; for the endangered hen harrier.

Sea fishing is an important industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly from a series of events in the second half of the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.

===Manufacturing and energy===
Northern England has a strong export-based economy, with trade more balanced than the UK average, and the North East is the only region of England to regularly export more than it imports. Chemicals, vehicles, machinery and other manufactured goods make up the majority of Northern exports, just over half of which go to EU countries. Major manufacturing plants include car plants at Vauxhall Ellesmere Port, Jaguar Land Rover Halewood and Nissan Sunderland, the Leyland Trucks factory, the Hitachi Newton Aycliffe train plant, the Humber, Lindsey and Stanlow oil refineries, the NEPIC cluster of chemical works based around Teesside, and the nuclear processing facilities at Springfields and Sellafield.

Offshore oil and gas from North Sea and Irish Sea, and more recently offshore wind power, are significant components in Northern England&#x27;s energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are still several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing (&quot;fracking&quot;) have proven to be controversial.

===Retail and services===

Around 10% of the Northern England workforce is employed in retail. Of the Big Four supermarkets in the UK, two – Asda and Morrisons – are based in the North. Northern England was the birthplace of the modern cooperative movement, and the Manchester-based Co-operative Group has the highest revenue of any firm in the North West. The area is also home to many online retailers, with startups emerging around tech hubs in Northern cities.

With urban regeneration, high-value service sector industries such as corporate services and financial services have taken root in Northern England, with major hubs around Leeds and Manchester. Call centres – attracted by low labour costs and a preference for Northern English accents among the public – have replaced heavy industry as major employers of unskilled workers, with more than 5% of workers in all Northern England regions working in one.

===High-tech and research===
Together, the N8 research universities have over 190,000 students and contribute more to the Northern economy in terms of GVA than agriculture, car manufacturing or media. Discoveries and inventions at these universities have resulted in spin-offs worth hundreds of millions to local economies: the discovery of graphene at the University of Manchester produced the National Graphene Institute and the Sir Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, while robotics research at the University of Sheffield led to the development of the Advanced Manufacturing Park.

Recent decades have seen the growth of high-tech companies based around Northern England&#x27;s major cities. There are eleven high-tech firms worth over $1 billion based in the region, and digital industries support around 300,000 jobs. Game development, online retail, health technology and analytics are among the major high-tech sectors in the North.

===Leisure and tourism===

The expansion of the railway network in the second half of the nineteenth century meant most in the North lived within reach of the coast, and seaside towns saw a major tourism boom. By around 1870 Blackpool on the Lancashire coast had become overwhelmingly the most popular destination – not just for Northern families, but many from the Midlands and Scotland as well. Other resorts popular with Northerners included Morecambe in northern Lancashire, Whitley Bay near Newcastle, Whitby in North Yorkshire, and New Brighton on the Wirral Peninsula, as well as Rhyl over the border in North Wales.

The same social forces that had built these resorts in the nineteenth century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth. Transport links continued to improve and it became possible to travel overseas quickly and affordably. The Belgian coast at Ostend became popular with Northern working-class tourists in the first half of the twentieth century, and the introduction of package holidays in the 1970s was the death of most Northern seaside resorts. Blackpool has maintained a focus on tourism, and remains one of the most visited towns in England, but visitor numbers are far below their peak and the town&#x27;s economy has suffered – both employment rates and average earnings remain below the regional average.

The wild landscapes of the North are a major draw for tourists, and many urban areas are looking for regeneration through industrial, heritage and cultural tourism: of the 24 national museums and galleries in England outside London, 14 are located in the North. In 2015, Northern England received around a quarter of all domestic tourism within the UK, with 28.7 million visitors in 2015, but only 8% of international tourists to the United Kingdom visit the region.

===Telecommunications===

Manchester Network Access Point is the only internet exchange point in the UK outside London, and forms the main hub for the region. Household internet access in Northern England is at or above the UK average, but speeds and broadband penetration vary greatly. In 2013 the average speed in central Manchester was 60 Mbit/s, while in nearby Warrington the average speed was only 6.2 Mbit/s. Hull, which is unique in the UK in that its telephone network was never nationalised, has simultaneously some of the fastest and slowest internet speeds in the country: many households have &quot;ultrafast&quot; fibre optic broadband as standard, but it is also one of only two places in the UK where over 30% of businesses receive less than 10 Mbit/s. Speeds are especially poor in the rural parts of the North, with many small towns and villages completely without high speed access. Some areas have therefore formed their own community enterprises, such as Broadband 4 Rural North in Lancashire and Cybermoor in Cumbria, to install high-speed internet connections. Mobile broadband coverage is similarly patchy, with 3G and 4G almost universal in cities but unavailable in large parts of Yorkshire, the North East and Cumbria.

==Media==
===Television===
As part of a drive to reduce media centralisation in London, the BBC and ITV have moved much of their programme production to MediaCityUK in Salford and Channel 4 has moved its headquarters to Leeds. Of the four national evening soap operas, three are set and filmed in Northern England (&quot;Coronation Street&quot; in Manchester, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; in the Yorkshire Dales and &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; in Liverpool but set in Chester) and these are important to the local TV industry – the commitment to &quot;Emmerdale&quot; saved ITV Yorkshire&#x27;s Leeds Studios from closure. The region also has a reputation for drama serials and has produced some the most successful and acclaimed series of recent decades, including &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;, &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, &quot;Clocking Off&quot;, &quot;Shameless&quot;, &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; and &quot;Last Tango in Halifax&quot;.

===Newspapers===
Since &quot;The Guardian&quot; (formerly &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;) moved to London in 1964, no major national paper is based in the North, and Northern news stories tend to be poorly covered in the national press. &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; promotes itself as &quot;Yorkshire&#x27;s national paper&quot; and covers some national and international stories, but is primarily focused on news from Yorkshire and the North East. An attempt in 2016 to create a dedicated North-focused national newspaper, &quot;24&quot;, failed after six weeks. Across Northern England as a whole, &quot;The Sun&quot; is the best selling newspaper, but the ongoing boycott around Merseyside following the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster has seen the paper fall behind both the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in the North West. In general national readership in the North drags behind that of the South; the &quot;Mirror&quot; and the &quot;Daily Star&quot; are the only national papers with more readers in Northern England than in the South East and London. Local newspapers are the top-selling titles in both the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, although Northern regional newspapers have seen steep declines in readership in recent years. Only seven daily Northern papers had circulation figures above 25,000 in June 2016: &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, &quot;Hull Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Newcastle Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; and &quot;The Northern Echo&quot;.

==Culture and identity==

The individual regions of the North have had their own identities and cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media and the opening of the North–South divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices—the North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s 1855 novel &quot;North and South&quot;—but became an affirmation of what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths. 

Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are straight-talking, grit and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners. Northern England—especially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East—has a tradition of matriarchal families, where the woman of the house runs the home and controls the family&#x27;s finances. This too has its roots in industrialisation, when mills offered well-paid work for women: during depressions when demand for coal and steel were low, women were often the main breadwinners. Northern women are still stereotyped as strong-willed and independent, or affectionately as battle-axes.

===&quot;It&#x27;s grim up north&quot;===

The phrase &quot;it&#x27;s grim up north&quot; is associated with coal mining, industrial mills, weather and the way of life in the north of England during the Victorian and post World War I eras, when mills, coal mining, child labour and slums were common. The phrase is often used by those who are not from the north of England, who paint the north as being different to the south of England. The current Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has quoted the north as being grim, but not a bad thing. The phrase was quoted in 1991 when the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu a.k.a. The KLF used it in relation to a lot of places in the north of England including Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Merseyside and Yorkshire. As well as parts of the East Midlands Region and Cumbria and they use the phrase repeatedly in their song of the same name.

===Clothing===

The North of England is often stereotypically represented through the clothing worn by working-class men and women in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. The maud, a woollen plaid woven in a pattern of small black and white checks, was also popular in Northern England until the early twentieth century.

If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as &quot;clogging&quot;, which was intricately developed in the North.

In the second half of the twentieth century, these traditional clothes fell out of fashion. Other styles such as &quot;casual clobber&quot; (mainland European designer clothing brought back by touring football fans) and sportswear became more popular, and the influence of Northern bands and football teams helped spread them across the country. In the twenty-first century, some traditional Northern items of clothing have begun to make a comeback – in particular, the flat cap.

===Cuisine===

Impressions of Northern English cuisine are still shaped by the working-class diet of the early twentieth century, which was heavy on offal, high in calories and often not particularly healthy. Dishes such as black pudding, tripe, mushy peas and meat pie remain stereotypical Northern English foods in the national imagination. As a result, there is a concerted effort among Northern chefs to improve the region&#x27;s image. Some Northern dishes such as Yorkshire pudding and Lancashire hotpot have spread across the UK, and only their names now hint at their origin. Among the Northern delicacies that have achieved Protected Geographical Status are traditional Cumberland sausage, traditional Grimsby smoked fish, Swaledale cheese, Yorkshire forced rhubarb and Yorkshire Wensleydale. 

The North is known for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the earliest example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.

While a variety of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is especially associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith Old Brewery&#x27;s Nut Brown Ale. Beer in the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, malty flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was the hub of the temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.

According to &quot;The Tab&quot;, the bakery chain Greggs is an integral part of Northern identity, using the number of people per Greggs as an indicator as to whether a town should be considered Northern.

Immigration to Northern England has shaped its cuisine. The Teesside parmo is one example, derived from escalope Parmesan brought to the area by an Italian-American immigrant and adapted to the region&#x27;s taste. There are large Chinatowns in Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle, and communities from the Indian subcontinent in all major towns. Bradford has won the Federation of Specialist Restaurant&#x27;s &quot;Curry Capital&quot; title six years in a row as of 2016, while the Curry Mile in Manchester formerly had the largest concentration of curry restaurants in the UK and now offers a wide range of South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine.

===Music===
Traditional folk music in Northern England is a combination of styles of England and Scotland – what is now called the Anglo-Scottish border ballad was once prevalent as far south as Lancashire. In the Middle Ages, much of Northern folk was accompanied by bagpipes, with styles including the Lancashire bagpipe, Yorkshire bagpipe and Northumbrian smallpipes. These disappeared in the early nineteenth century from the industrialising south of the region, but remain in the music of Northumbria. 

The British brass band tradition began in Northern England at around the same time: the dismissal of the Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire military bands after the Napoleonic Wars, combined with the desire of industrial communities to better themselves, led to the founding of civilian bands. These bands provided entertainment at community events and led protest marches during the era of radical agitation. Although the style has since spread across much of Great Britain, brass bands remain a stereotype of the North, and the Whit Friday brass band contests draw hundreds of bands from across the UK and further afield.

Northern England also has a thriving popular music scene. Influential movements include Merseybeat from the Liverpool area, which produced The Beatles, Northern soul, which brought Motown to England, and Madchester, the precursor to the rave scene. Across the Pennines, Sheffield is the birthplace of influential electronic pop bands from Cabaret Voltaire to Pulp, the New Yorkshire indie rock movement of the 2000s gave the country the Kaiser Chiefs and the Arctic Monkeys, and Teesside has a rock scene stretching from Chris Rea to Maxïmo Park. The press frequently frames music stories and reviews in terms of cultural and class differences between North and South, notably in the 1960s rivalry between the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the 1990s Battle of Britpop between Oasis and Blur.

==Sport==

Sport has been both one of the most unifying cultural forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most divisive. As huge numbers of people moved into recently built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that was otherwise absent.

Many early Northern sports players were working class and needed to miss work to play, with their teams compensating them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from the traditions of public schools and Oxbridge, put great emphasis on amateurism and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension shaped the sports of association football and cricket, and led to the schism between the two main forms of rugby. The North is also associated with the animal sports of dog racing with whippets, pigeon racing and ferret legging, although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality.

Manchester hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games, which left it a legacy of sporting facilities including the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester Aquatics Centre and the National Cycling Centre, headquarters of British Cycling. The Grand Départ for the 2014 Tour de France was in Leeds, and every year since Yorkshire has hosted the Tour de Yorkshire cycling event, part of the UCI Europe Tour. Tyneside meanwhile hosts the Great North Run, the UK&#x27;s biggest mass-participation sporting event and the most popular half marathon in the world.

===Association football===

The first football club in the UK was Sheffield F.C., founded in 1857. Early Northern football teams tended to adopt the Sheffield Rules rather than the Football Association Rules, but the two codes were merged in 1877. Many of the innovations of Sheffield Rules are now part of the global game, including corners, throw-ins, and free kicks for fouls.

In 1883 Blackburn Olympic, a team composed mainly of factory workers, became the first Northern team to win the FA Cup, and the next year Preston North End won an FA Cup match against London-based Upton Park. Upton Park protested that Preston had broken FA rules by paying their players. In response, Preston withdrew from the competition and fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the North, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. A schism was avoided in July 1885 when professionalism was formally legalised in English football. The Football League was founded in 1888, and marked its independence from the London-based Football Association (FA) by establishing headquarters in Preston – the League retained a Northern identity even after it accepted several Southern teams into its ranks. 

Organised women&#x27;s football followed as the workforces of majority-female factories of Northern England in the First World War entered the 1917–18 Tyne, Wear &amp; Tees Munition Girls Cup – the world&#x27;s first women&#x27;s football tournament. However, the FA did not support women&#x27;s football and banned it altogether in 1921. Intense local derbies between neighbouring teams mean that there is less of a North–South rivalry than in some other sports.

Many of the powerhouses of English football came from the North – as of the 2022–23 season, of the 125 top-flight league titles since 1888, 85 (68%) have been won by teams based north of Crewe. Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are among the mainstays of the Premier League, while teams like Blackburn Rovers, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United and Sunderland have had more inconsistent runs in recent years, regularly being promoted and relegated from the top flight. 

Northern England is also the birthplace of the largest proportion the country&#x27;s top players – as of Euro 2016, 537 Northerners had played for the England team, compared to 266 Midlanders and 367 Southerners, and 15 of the 23 man squad for the 2018 World Cup, as well as 14 of the 2019 Women&#x27;s World Cup squad, were born in the region.

===Rugby football===
The Rugby Football Union (RFU), which enforced amateurism, suspended teams who compensated their players for missed work and injury, leading teams from Lancashire, Yorkshire and surrounding areas to split away in 1895 and form the Rugby Football League (RFL). Over time, the RFU and RFL adopted different rules and the two forms of the game – rugby union and rugby league – diverged. Rugby league&#x27;s stronghold remains Northern England along the &quot;M62 corridor&quot; between Liverpool and Hull. As of the 2023 season, 11 of the 12 teams in the Super League (the highest level of rugby league in the Northern Hemisphere) are from Northern England, with one team from France, and the 14-team Championship below it has 12 Northern teams, one London team and 1 French team.

Rugby union was not entirely driven from Northern England, and in the 1970s the region was home to several strong teams. The high-water mark of rugby union in Northern England was the 1979 New Zealand tour during which the English Northern Division was the only team to defeat the All Blacks. In the 21st century the region&#x27;s club sides have become less popular, with association football, cricket and rugby league attracting more spectators and talent. In the 2022–23 season, Sale Sharks and Newcastle Falcons play in the English Premiership, and Doncaster Knights play in the RFU Championship.

===Cricket===

Cricket has a strong following in Northern England, and three counties are represented by first-class county cricket teams: Durham, Lancashire and Yorkshire. The Roses Match (named for the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York) between Lancashire and Yorkshire is one of the hardest fought rivalries in the sport – the pride of both sides, and their determination not to lose, resulted in the teams developing a slow, stubborn and defensive style that proved unpopular elsewhere in the country. The London-based Marylebone Cricket Club, which controlled the game at the time, selected few Northern players for Test matches, and this was perceived as a snub to their playing style – the anger united Lancashire and Yorkshire against the South and helped cast a shared Northern identity that transcended the Roses rivalry. This divide was illustrated in the 1924 County Championship, when Yorkshire beat London-based Middlesex to claim the title. Surrey accused Yorkshire of scuffing the pitch and intimidating the bowlers, while the match with Middlesex was so vicious that the team threatened to never play in Yorkshire again. The Lancashire captain Jack Sharp on the other hand was quoted as saying &quot;I&#x27;m real glad a rose won it. Red or white, it doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot; Durham are a recent addition to top-flight cricket, having only achieved first-class status in 1992, but have won the County Championship three times.

Although Yorkshire and Lancashire were traditionally more relaxed about professionalism than other counties, cricket did not see the same regional schisms on the topic that rugby and football did – there were debates over amateur status in first-class cricket, but these tensions were given release in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. Nevertheless, the annual North v South games were among the most popular and competitive in the sport, running annually from 1849 until 1900 and intermittently thereafter.

==Politics==
Northern England, as the first area in the world to industrialise, was the birthplace of much modern political thought. Marxism and, more generally, socialism were shaped by reports into the lives of the Northern working class, from Friedrich Engels&#x27; &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot; to George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot;. Meanwhile, enterprise and trade at the North&#x27;s ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, the movement&#x27;s greatest success was the repeal of the Corn Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester.
The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester in 1868, and as of 2015 trade union membership in Northern England remained higher than in Southern England, although it is lower than in the other Home Nations. Since the Thatcher era, the Conservative Party struggled to gain support in the area. Today, Northern England is generally described as a stronghold of the Labour Party – although the Conservatives hold some rural seats, they traditionally held almost no urban seats and as of the 2021 local elections there are no Conservative councillors on Liverpool City Council, Manchester City Council or Newcastle City Council, and only one on Sheffield City Council. During the 2019 general election, many traditionally Labour constituencies in Northern England swung heavily towards the Conservatives, and the collapse of the &quot;red wall&quot; of Northern Labour seats was a major factor in the Conservative victory. Historically the region was also a heartland for the Liberals, and between the 1980s and the 2010s their successors in the Liberal Democrats benefited from Conservative unpopularity by positioning themselves as the centrist alternative to Labour in the North.

At the 2016 EU membership referendum, all three Northern England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave vote in the Northern England regions was 55.9% – higher than in the Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in Northern constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right British National Party (BNP), who exploited racial tensions in the wake of the 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from Northern constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as most voters swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances.

Campaigns for Northern English devolution have seen little electoral support. Plans by Labour under Tony Blair to create devolved regional assemblies for the three Northern regions were abandoned after the government lost the 2004 North East England devolution referendum against a No vote of 78%. The regionalist Yorkshire Party and North East Party only hold seats at the local council level, and the Northern Party, which campaigned for a devolved Northern government with the power to make laws and full control of taxation and spending, was wound up in 2016.

The Northern Independence Party was founded in October 2020, a secessionist and democratic socialist political party that seeks to make Northern England an independent nation, under the name of Northumbria.

==Religion==
===Christianity===

Christianity has been the largest religion in the region since the Early Middle Ages; its existence in Britain dates back to the late Roman era and the arrival of Celtic Christianity. The Holy Island of Lindisfarne played an essential role in the Christianisation of Northumbria, after Aidan from Connacht founded a monastery there as the first Bishop of Lindisfarne at the request of King Oswald. It is known for the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and remains a place of pilgrimage. Saint Cuthbert, a monk of Lindisfarne, was venerated from Nottinghamshire to Cumberland, and is today sometimes named the patron saint of Northern England. The Synod of Whitby saw Northumbria break from Celtic Christianity and return to the Roman Catholic church, as calculations of Easter and tonsure rules were brought into line with those of Rome.

After the English Reformation Northern England became a centre of Catholicism, and Irish immigration increased its numbers further, especially in North West cities like Liverpool and Manchester. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the area underwent a religious revival that ultimately produced Primitive Methodism, and at its peak in the 19th century Methodism was the dominant faith in much of Northern England.

As of 2016, the list of places of worship registered for marriage for Northern England included at least 1,960 that are Methodist or Independent Methodist, 1,200 Roman Catholic, 370 United Reformed, 310 Baptist or Particular Baptist, 250 Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and 240 Salvation Army, as well as many hundreds of churches from smaller denominations. 

In the ecclesiastical administration of the Church of England the entire North is covered by the Province of York, which is represented by the Archbishop of York – the second-highest figure in the Church after the Archbishop of Canterbury. The unusual situation of having two archbishops at the top of Church hierarchy suggests that Northern England was seen as a &quot;sui generis&quot;. Likewise, with the exception of parts of the Diocese of Shrewsbury and Diocese of Nottingham, the North is covered in Roman Catholic Church administration by the Province of Liverpool, represented by the Archbishop of Liverpool.

===Other faiths===
Small Jewish communities arose in Beverley, Doncaster, Grimsby, Lancaster, Newcastle, and York in the wake of the Norman Conquest but suffered massacres and pogroms, of which the largest was the York Massacre in 1190. Jews were forcibly banished from England by the 1290 Edict of Expulsion until the Resettlement of the Jews in England in the seventeenth century, and the first synagogue in the North appeared in Liverpool in 1753. Manchester also has a long-standing Jewish community: the now-demolished 1857 Manchester Reform Synagogue was the second Reform synagogue in the country, and Greater Manchester has the only eruv in the United Kingdom outside London. Traditionally, there is also a large Jewish presence in Gateshead. In total, there are 84 synagogues in Northern England registered for marriages.

Spiritualism flourished in Northern England in the nineteenth century, in part as a backlash to the fundamentalist Primitive Methodist movement and in part driven by the influence of Owenist socialism. There remain 220 Spiritualist churches registered in the North, of which 40 identify as Christian Spiritualist.

The first mosque in the United Kingdom was founded by the convert Abdullah Quilliam in the Liverpool Muslim Institute in 1889. Today, there are around 500 mosques in Northern England. Indian religions are also represented: there are at least 45 gurdwaras, of which the largest is the Sikh Temple in Leeds, and 30 mandirs, of which the largest is Bradford Lakshmi Narayan Hindu Temple.

==Transport==
Transport in the North has been shaped by the Pennines, creating strong north–south axes along each coast and an east–west axis across the moorland passes of the southern Pennines. Northern England is a centre of freight transport and handles around one third of all British cargo. Both passenger and freight links between Northern cities remain poor, which is a major weakness of the Northern economy.

The passenger transport executive (PTE) has become a major player in the organisation of public transport within Northern city regions; of the six PTEs in England, five (Transport for Greater Manchester, Merseytravel, Travel South Yorkshire, Nexus Tyne and Wear and West Yorkshire Metro) are located in the North. These coordinate bus services, local trains and light rail in their regions. Following the passage of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016, Transport for the North became a statutory body in 2018 with powers to coordinate services and offer integrated ticketing throughout the region.

===Road===
The Preston By-pass, opened in 1958, was the first motorway in the UK, and today an extensive network connects the major cities of the North. The major north-south motorway routes are the western M6 and eastern M1/A1(M), the Great North Road became the modern A1 road with the M1 using an alternative route and the A1 (M) is the upgraded A1. The A19 is a major north-south A-road also in the east. The M62 (over the south Pennines) is the major east-west motorway, it follows the Roman road between York and Chester. The A59, A66 and A69 are also major east-west A-roads. 

Older streets in the north are called gates with a number of terms for small streets such as chare, wynd, tenfoot, vennel, snicket and ginnel. York goes as far as to merge the latter two terms with alleyway to form the term snickelways. These small streets can be cobbled or block-paved; pitched paving is a common in-between type of paving most often used.

Buses are an important part of the Northern transport mix, with bus ridership above the England and Wales average in all three Northern regions. Many of the municipal bus companies were located in Northern England creating intense competition and bus wars following deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Increasing car ownership in the same era caused bus use to decline, although it remains higher than in most areas of the South.

===Rail===
The North of England pioneered rail transport. Milestones include the 1758 Middleton Railway in Leeds, the first railway authorised by Act of Parliament and the oldest continually operating in the world; the 1825 Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first public railway to use steam locomotives; and the 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first modern main line. Today the region retains many of its original railway lines, including the East Coast and West Coast main lines and the Cross Country Route. Passenger numbers on Northern routes increased over 50% between 2004 and 2016, and Northern England handles over half of total UK rail freight, but infrastructure is poorly funded compared to Southern railways: railways in London received £5426 per resident in 2015 while those in the North East received just £223 per resident, and journeys between major cities are slow and overcrowded.

To combat this, the Department of Transport has devolved many of its powers to Rail North, an alliance of local authorities from the Scottish Borders down to Staffordshire which manages the Northern Rail and TransPennine Express franchises that operate many routes in Northern England. Meanwhile, new build such as the Northern Hub around Manchester and Northern Powerhouse Rail from Liverpool to Hull and Newcastle is planned to increase capacity on important Northern routes and decrease travel times. The planned High Speed 2 (HS2) line would have connected Manchester and Leeds to Birmingham and London, but cuts to HS2 saw all Northern branches of the line cancelled.

The first passenger tram line in the UK was built in Birkenhead and opened on 30 August 1860 (partially open intermittently as a heritage tramway). Trams turned out to be especially well suited for Northern cities, with their growing working-class suburbs, and by the turn of the century, most Northern towns had an extensive interconnected electric tram network. At the network&#x27;s height, it was possible to travel entirely by tram from Liverpool Pier Head to the village of Summit, outside Rochdale, a distance of , and a gap of only separated the North-Western network from the West Yorkshire network. Starting in the 1930s, these were largely replaced by motor buses and trolley buses. With the closure of Sheffield Tramway in 1960 and Glasgow Tramway in 1962, Blackpool Tramway – popular as a tourist attraction as much as a means of transport – was left as the only public tram system in the UK until the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. Today there are four light rail systems in the North – Blackpool Tramway, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram and Tyne &amp; Wear Metro.

===Air===
In total, there are six international airports in the North; these are (in descending order of passenger traffic) Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool John Lennon, Leeds Bradford, Teesside and Humberside. 

Manchester Airport is a major hub and the busiest airport anywhere in the UK outside London, handling 23.3 million people in 2022 (10.5% of all UK passengers), and Newcastle (4.1 million), Liverpool (3.5 million) and Leeds-Bradford (3.3 million) serve their city regions. 

Other airports in the North have struggled. Teesside and Humberside both see very little traffic while other airports have closed to commercial flights entirely: Blackpool closed in 2014, Carlisle Lake District in 2020 and Doncaster Sheffield in 2022. Many of these airports were developed during the boom in low-cost air travel during the early 2000s and suffered following the Great Recession and COVID lockdowns.

The devolution of Air Passenger Duty in Scotland allows Scottish airports to offer cheaper flights than their English rivals as well as London airports turning Northern airports to spoke airports, forcing connecting passengers to travel via London or continental European airports for major destinations.

===Water===
The first modern canal in England was Sankey Brook, opened in 1757 to connect Liverpool&#x27;s ports to the St Helens coalfields. By 1777, the Grand Trunk Canal had opened, linking the rivers Mersey and Trent and making it possible for boats to travel directly from Liverpool to Hull. Manchester, inland, was connected to the Irish Sea by the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, although the canal never saw the success that was hoped for. The North retains many navigable canals, including the Cheshire, North Pennine and South Pennine canal rings, although they are now used mostly for pleasure rather than transport – the Aire and Calder Navigation, which carries over 2 million tons of oil, sand and gravel per year, is a rare exception.

Many Northern coastal towns were built on trade, and retain large sea ports. The Humber ports of Grimsby and Immingham (counted as a single port for statistical purposes) are the busiest in the UK in terms of tonnage, serving 59.1 million tons as of 2015, and Teesport and the Port of Liverpool are also among the country&#x27;s largest – in total, 35% of British freight was shipped through Northern ports. Roll-on/roll-off ferries offer passenger and freight connections to the Isle of Man and Ireland along the west coast, while east coast ports connect to Belgium and the Netherlands, although Northern ports handle only a small percentage of the UK&#x27;s vehicle traffic. Liverpool Cruise Terminal opened in 2007, cruises also operate out of Port of Hull and Newcastle International Ferry Terminal.

<text>New York is an American biweekly magazine concerned with life, culture, politics, and style generally, with a particular emphasis on New York City.

Founded by Clay Felker and Milton Glaser in 1968 as a competitor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, it was brasher in voice and more connected to contemporary city life and commerce, and became a cradle of New Journalism. Over time, it became more national in scope, publishing many noteworthy articles about American culture by writers such as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Nora Ephron, Pete Hamill, Jacob Weisberg, Michael Wolff, John Heilemann, Frank Rich, and Rebecca Traister. It was among the first &quot;lifestyle magazines&quot; meant to appeal to both male and female audiences, and its format and style have been emulated by many American regional and city publications.

&quot;New York&quot; in its earliest days focused almost entirely on coverage of its namesake city, but beginning in the 1970s, it expanded into reporting and commentary on national politics, notably Richard Reeves on Watergate, Joe Klein&#x27;s early cover story about Bill Clinton, John Heilemann&#x27;s reporting on the 2008 presidential election that led to his (and Mark Halperin&#x27;s) best-selling book &quot;Game Change&quot;, Jonathan Chait&#x27;s commentary, and Olivia Nuzzi&#x27;s reporting on the first Trump administration. &quot;The New Republic&quot; praised its &quot;hugely impressive political coverage&quot; during the presidency of Barack Obama. It is also known for its arts and culture criticism, its food writing (its restaurant critic Adam Platt won a James Beard Award in 2009, and its Underground Gourmet critics Rob Patronite and Robin Raisfeld won two National Magazine Awards), and its service journalism (its &quot;Strategist&quot; department won seven National Magazine Awards in eleven years.

Since its sale, redesign, and relaunch in 2004, the magazine has won several National Magazine Awards, including the award for general excellence in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2016, as well as the 2013 award for Magazine of the Year. Since the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism opened to magazines as well as newspapers in 2016, &quot;New York&quot;″s critics have won twice (Jerry Saltz in 2018, and Andrea Long Chu in 2023) and been finalists twice more (Justin Davidson in 2020 and Craig Jenkins in 2021). In 2009, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; media critic Howard Kurtz wrote that &quot;the nation&#x27;s best and most-imitated city magazine is often not about the city—at least not in the overcrowded, traffic-clogged, five-boroughs sense,&quot; observing that it was more regularly publishing political and cultural stories of national and international import.

The magazine&#x27;s first website, nymetro.com, was launched in 2001. In the early 21st century, the magazine began to diversify that online presence, introducing subject-specific websites under the nymag.com umbrella: &quot;Vulture&quot;, &quot;The Cut&quot;, &quot;Intelligencer, The Strategist, Curbed&quot;, and &quot;Grub Street&quot;. In 2018, New York Media, the parent company of &quot;New York&quot; magazine, launched a digital subscription product for those sites. On September 24, 2019, Vox Media announced that it had purchased &quot;New York&quot; magazine and its parent company, New York Media.

==History==

===1960s===
&quot;New York&quot; was created in 1963 as the Sunday-magazine supplement of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; newspaper. The &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;, then in financial difficulty, had recently been sold to John Hay Whitney, and was looking to revitalize its business with an increased focus on editorial excellence, which included a relaunch of the Sunday edition and its magazine. Edited first by Sheldon Zalaznick and then by Clay Felker, the relaunched magazine, called &quot;New York&quot;, showcased the work of many talented &quot;Tribune&quot; contributors, including Tom Wolfe, Barbara Goldsmith, Gail Sheehy, Dick Schaap, and Jimmy Breslin. The &quot;Tribune&quot; went out of business in 1966, and &quot;New York&quot; was briefly revived as part of a combined paper, the &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot;, that lasted until May 1967. Shortly after the &quot;WJT&quot; closed, Felker and his partner, Milton Glaser, purchased the rights to the nameplate, backed by Wall Street bankers led by Armand G. Erpf (the magazine&#x27;s first chairman, who Felker attributed as the financial architect of the magazine) and C. Gerald Goldsmith (Barbara Goldsmith&#x27;s husband at the time), and reincarnated the magazine as a stand-alone glossy weekly. Joining them was managing editor Jack Nessel, Felker&#x27;s number-two at the &quot;Herald Tribune.&quot; &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s first issue was dated April 8, 1968. Several writers came from the magazine&#x27;s earlier incarnation, including Breslin, Wolfe (who wrote &quot;You and Your Big Mouth: How the Honks and Wonks Reveal the Phonetic Truth about Status&quot; in the inaugural issue), and George Goodman, a financial writer who wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Adam Smith.&quot; Glaser and his deputy Walter Bernard designed and laid out the magazine and hired many notable artists, including Jim McMullan, Robert Grossman, and David Levine, to produce covers and illustrations.

Within a year, Felker had assembled a team of contributors who would come to define the magazine&#x27;s voice. Breslin became a regular, as did Nicholas Pileggi, Gail Sheehy, and Gloria Steinem, who wrote a politics column. Judith Crist wrote movie reviews. Harold Clurman was hired as the theater critic, then replaced a few months later by John Simon, who became notorious for his harsh reviews. Alan Rich covered the classical-music scene. Barbara Goldsmith wrote a series called &quot;The Creative Environment&quot;, in which she interviewed such subjects as Marcel Breuer, I. M. Pei, George Balanchine, and Pablo Picasso about their process. Gael Greene, writing under the rubric &quot;The Insatiable Critic&quot;, reviewed restaurants, cultivating a baroque writing style that leaned heavily on sexual metaphor. The office for the magazine was on the top floor of the old Tammany Hall clubhouse at 207 East 32nd Street, which Glaser owned. The magazine did not consistently turn a profit in these early years: One board member, Alan Patricof, later said that &quot;it may have touched into the black for a quarter, then out of it, but it was not significantly profitable.&quot;

===1970s===
Wolfe, a regular contributor to the magazine, wrote a story in 1970 that captured the spirit of the magazine (if not the age): &quot;Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny&#x27;s&quot;. The controversial and often criticized article described a benefit party for the Black Panthers, held in Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s apartment, in a collision of high culture and low that paralleled &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s ethos and expressed Wolfe&#x27;s interest in status and class.

In 1972, &quot;New York&quot;″s year-end issue incorporated a 30-page preview of the first issue of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine, edited by Gloria Steinem. Gail Sheehy&#x27;s &quot;The Search for Grey Gardens&quot;, a cover story about the notorious mother-and-daughter Beale household of East Hampton, led to the Maysles brothers&#x27; acclaimed documentary.

As the 1970s progressed, Felker continued to broaden the magazine&#x27;s editorial vision beyond Manhattan, covering Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal closely. He also launched &quot;New West&quot;, a sister magazine on &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s model that covered California life, published in separate Northern California and Southern California editions. In 1976, journalist Nik Cohn wrote a story called &quot;Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night&quot;, about a young man in a working-class Brooklyn neighborhood who, once a week, went to a local disco called Odyssey 2001; the story was a sensation and served as the basis for the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. Twenty years later, in a followup story in &quot;New York&quot;, Cohn admitted that he had made up the character and most of the story.

In 1976, the Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch bought the magazine in a hostile takeover, forcing Felker and Glaser out. A succession of top editors followed through the remainder of the decade, including James Brady, Joe Armstrong (who also served as publisher), John Berendt, and (briefly) Jane Amsterdam.

===1980s===
In 1980, Murdoch hired Edward Kosner, the former editor of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, to replace Armstrong. Murdoch also bought &quot;Cue&quot;, a listings magazine founded by Mort Glankoff that had covered the city since 1932, and folded it into &quot;New York&quot;, simultaneously creating a useful going-out guide and eliminating a competitor. Kosner&#x27;s magazine shifted the mix of the magazine toward newsmagazine-style cover stories, trend pieces, and pure &quot;service&quot; features—long articles on shopping and other consumer subjects—as well as close coverage of the glitzy 1980s New York City scene epitomized by financiers Donald Trump and Saul Steinberg. The magazine was profitable for most of the 1980s. The term &quot;the Brat Pack&quot; was coined for a 1985 cover story in the magazine.

===1990s===
Murdoch got out of the magazine business in 1991 by selling his holdings to K-III Communications, a partnership controlled by financier Henry Kravis. Subsequent budget pressure from K-III frustrated Kosner, and he left in 1993, taking over the editorship of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. After several months during which the magazine was run by managing editor Peter Herbst, K-III hired Kurt Andersen, the co-creator of &quot;Spy&quot;, a humor monthly of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Andersen quickly replaced several staff members, bringing in emerging and established writers (including Jim Cramer, Walter Kirn, Michael Tomasky, and Jacob Weisberg) and editors (including Michael Hirschorn, Kim France, Dany Levy, and Maer Roshan), and generally making the magazine faster-paced, younger in outlook, and more knowing in tone. In August 1996, Bill Reilly fired Andersen from his editorship, citing the publication&#x27;s financial results. According to Andersen, he was fired for refusing to kill a story about a rivalry between investment bankers Felix Rohatyn and Steven Rattner that had upset Henry Kravis, a member of the firm&#x27;s ownership group. His replacement was Caroline Miller, who came from &quot;Seventeen&quot;, another K-III title. In part owing to the company&#x27;s financial constraints, Miller and her editors focused on cultivating younger writers, including Ariel Levy, Jennifer Senior, Robert Kolker, and Vanessa Grigoriadis. She also hired Michael Wolff, whose writing about media and politics became an extremely popular component of the magazine.

===2000s===
The magazine&#x27;s first website, under the url nymetro.com, appeared in 2001. In 2002 and 2003, Wolff, the media critic Miller had hired in 1998, won two National Magazine Awards for his columns. At the end of 2003, &quot;New York&quot; was sold again, to a family trust controlled by financier Bruce Wasserstein, for $55 million. Wasserstein, early in 2004, replaced Miller with Adam Moss, who had founded the short-lived New York weekly &quot;7 Days&quot; and then edited &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. That fall, Moss and his staff relaunched the magazine, most notably with two new sections: &quot;The Strategist&quot;, devoted mostly to service, food, and shopping, and &quot;The Culture Pages&quot;, covering the city&#x27;s arts scene. Moss also rehired Kurt Andersen as a columnist. In early 2006, the company relaunched the magazine&#x27;s website, previously nymetro.com, as nymag.com.

&quot;New York&quot; in this period won design awards at the National Magazine Awards and was named Magazine of the Year by the Society of Publication Designers (SPD) in 2006 and 2007. A 2008 cover about Eliot Spitzer&#x27;s prostitution scandal, created by the artist Barbara Kruger and displaying the word &quot;Brain&quot; with an arrow pointed at Spitzer&#x27;s crotch, was named Cover of the Year by the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) and &quot;Advertising Age&quot;. The next year, another cover, &quot;Bernie Madoff, Monster&quot;, was named Best News &amp; Business Cover by ASME. &quot;New York&quot; won back-to-back ASME Cover of the Year awards in 2012 and 2013, for &quot;Is She Just Too Old for This?&quot; and &quot;The City and the Storm&quot; respectively. Design director Chris Dixon and photography director Jody Quon were named &quot;Design Team of the Year&quot; by Adweek in 2008.

When Bruce Wasserstein died in 2009, David Carr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;While previous owners had required constant features in the magazine about the best place to get a croissant or a beret, it was clear that Wasserstein wanted a publication that was the best place to learn about the complicated apparatus that is modern New York. In enabling as much, Mr. Wasserstein recaptured the original intent of the magazine&#x27;s founder, Clay Felker.&quot; Wasserstein&#x27;s children retained control of the magazine, which continued to be overseen by his deputy Anup Bagaria.

In 2006, &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s website, NYMag.com, underwent a year-long relaunch, transforming from a site that principally republished the magazine&#x27;s content to an up-to-the-minute news- and- service destination. In 2008, parent company New York Media also purchased the restaurant- and-menu site MenuPages as a complement to its own restaurant coverage, reselling it in 2011 to Seamless.

With the launch of Grub Street, devoted to food, and Daily Intelligencer (later renamed just &quot;Intelligencer&quot;), its politics site, both in 2006; Vulture, its culture site, in 2007; and The Cut, its fashion-and-women&#x27;s-interest site, in 2008, &quot;New York&quot; began shifting significant resources toward digital-only publication. These sites were intended to adapt the urbane sensibility of the print magazine for a national and international audience, and attract readership that had been lost by print magazines in general, particularly fashion and entertainment outlets. By July 2010, digital ads accounted for one-third of the company&#x27;s advertising revenue. David Carr noted in an August 2010 column, &quot;In a way, &quot;New York&quot; magazine is fast becoming a digital enterprise with a magazine attached.&quot;

===2010s===
On March 1, 2011, it was announced that Frank Rich would leave &quot;The New York Times&quot; to become an essayist and editor-at-large for &quot;New York&quot;.

&quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of 9/11&quot;, published on the tenth anniversary of the attacks, was described by Gizmodo as &quot;heartbreaking, locked in the past, and entirely current&quot;; the issue won a National Magazine Award for Single-Topic Issue.

In October 2012, &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s offices in lower Manhattan were without electricity in the week following Hurricane Sandy, so the editorial staff published an issue from a quickly constructed temporary newsroom in the midtown office of Wasserstein &amp; Company. The issue&#x27;s cover, shot by photographer Iwan Baan from a helicopter and showing Manhattan half in darkness, almost immediately became an iconic image of the storm; &quot;Time&quot; called it the magazine cover of the year. The image was republished as a poster by the Museum of Modern Art, with proceeds benefiting Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. The following spring, &quot;New York&quot; took the top honor at the National Magazine Awards, again receiving the Magazine of the Year award for its print and digital coverage.

In December 2013, as readership for its digital sites continued to build, the magazine announced plans to shift the print edition to biweekly publication the following March, reducing from 42 issues per year to 26 plus three special editions.

In April 2016, the magazine announced the launch of Select All, a new vertical dedicated to technology and innovation. In 2019, Select All was shuttered and folded into the broadened &quot;Intelligencer&quot; news site.

In the mid-2010s, &quot;New York&quot; launched several podcasts jointly produced with other outlets, all short-lived. Its first independently owned podcast, Good One: A Podcast About Jokes, hosted by Jesse David Fox, launched in February 2017. The magazine also expanded into television, collaborating with Michael Hirschorn&#x27;s Ish Entertainment and Bravo to produce a pilot for a weekly. TV show based on its popular back-page feature, the Approval Matrix. &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s art critic Jerry Saltz appeared as a judge on Bravo&#x27;s reality competition series &quot;Work of Art: The Next Great Artist&quot; in 2010 and 2011. Grub Street senior editor Alan Sytsma appeared as a guest on judge on three episodes of the third season of &quot;Top Chef Masters&quot;.

April 2018 was &quot;New York&quot;″s 50th anniversary, marked with a book-length history of the magazine and its city, published by Simon &amp; Schuster and titled &quot;Highbrow, Lowbrow, Brilliant, Despicable: 50 Years of New York&quot;. The magazine also produced a commemorative issue and celebrated with a party at Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen. That year, The Cut introduced its podcast, &quot;The Cut on Tuesdays&quot;, produced jointly with Gimlet Media and hosted by one of the site&#x27;s writers, Molly Fischer.

In December 2018, &quot;New York&quot;&#x27;s fashion and beauty destination site, The Cut, carried a piece titled &quot;Is Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas&#x27;s Love for Real?&quot;, that drew severe backlash from readers for accusing Chopra of trapping Jonas into a fraudulent relationship and calling her a &quot;global scam artist&quot;. The publication removed the piece the following morning and issued an apology.

In January 2019, Moss announced that he was retiring from the editorship. David Haskell, one of his chief deputies, succeeded him as editor on April 1, 2019. That spring, the magazine laid off several staff members and temporary employees.

On September 24, 2019, Vox Media announced that it had purchased the magazine&#x27;s parent company, New York Media LLC. Pam Wasserstein, the CEO of New York Media, became Vox Media&#x27;s president, working closely with its CEO, Jim Bankoff.

=== 2020s ===
After the merger with Vox Media, May 2020, Vox Media announced it was merging the real estate site &quot;Curbed&quot; into &quot;New York&quot; and refocusing the site on its roots in New York City. That year, &quot;New York&quot; also expanded its podcast business, adding &quot;Pivot&quot;, &quot;On With Kara Swisher&quot;, &quot;Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel&quot;, &quot;Switched on Pop&quot;, and &quot;Into It With Sam Sanders&quot; to its lineup. The company also saw an expansion of its intellectual property into television and movies, notably with &quot;Hustlers&quot;, a feature film adapted from a story by Jessica Pressler. In 2022, three television series adapted from &quot;New York&quot; properties appeared: &quot;Inventing Anna&quot; and &quot;The Watcher&quot; on Netflix, and &quot;Sex Diaries&quot; on HBO. The magazine also moved into publishing an array of digital newsletters, including &quot;Are U Coming?&quot;, which documented the nightlife of city emerging from Covid lockdown; &quot;The Year I Ate New York&quot;, written in 2022 by Tammie Taclamarian and in 2023 by E. Alex Jung; and a collection of limited-series newsletters devoted to &quot;Succession&quot;, &quot;…And Just Like That&quot;, and prominent New York City court cases.

Notable stories published by &quot;New York&quot; in this decade include Nicholson Baker&#x27;s investigation of the possibility that a lab leak instigated the COVID-19 epidemic; a cover package, &quot;Ten Years Since Trayvon,&quot; about the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement; and &quot;The Year of the Nepo Baby,&quot; a widely discussed feature about dynastic career advancement in Hollywood. Lindsay Peoples became the editor of The Cut in 2021, and Vulture hired book critic Andrea Long Chu, who subsequently won the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.

==Puzzles and competitions==

&quot;New York&quot; magazine has long run literary competitions and distinctive crossword puzzles. For the first year of the magazine&#x27;s existence, the composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim contributed an extremely complex cryptic crossword to every third issue. Sondheim eventually ceded the job in order to write his next musical, and Richard Maltby, Jr. took over . For many years the magazine also syndicated The Times of London&#x27;s cryptic crossword.

Beginning in early 1969, for two weeks out of every three, Sondheim&#x27;s friend Mary Ann Madden edited an extremely popular witty literary competition calling for readers to send in humorous poetry or other bits of wordplay on a given theme that changed with each installment. (A typical entry, in a competition calling for humorous epitaphs, supplied this one for Geronimo: &quot;Requiescat in Apache.&quot;) Altogether, Madden ran 973 installments of the competition, retiring in 2000. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries were received each week, and winners included David Mamet, Herb Sargent, and Dan Greenburg. David Halberstam once claimed that he had submitted entries 137 times without winning. Madden published three volumes of Competition winners, titled &quot;Thank You for the Giant Sea Tortoise&quot;, &quot;Son of Giant Sea Tortoise&quot;, and &quot;Maybe He&#x27;s Dead: And Other Hilarious Results of New York Magazine Competitions&quot;.

Beginning in 1980, the magazine ran an American-style crossword constructed by Maura B. Jacobson. Jacobson retired in April 2011, having created 1,400 puzzles for the magazine, after which the job passed to Cathy Allis Millhauser and then Matt Gaffney. In January 2020, &quot;Vulture&quot; began publishing daily 10x10 crosswords by two constructors, Malaika Handa and Stella Zawistowski.

== Sites operated by &quot;New York&quot; ==

=== &quot;Intelligencer&quot; ===
&quot;New York&quot;″s news blog was introduced under the name Daily Intelligencer, expanding upon the weekly magazine&#x27;s front-of-the-book Intelligencer section. Launched in 2006, it was initially written mostly by Jessica Pressler and Chris Rovzar, whose coverage focused on local politics, media, and Wall Street but also included extensive chatter about the television show &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. Over its first half-decade, the site expanded in reach and became more focused on national politics, notably with the addition of columnist Jonathan Chait in 2011 and the longtime political blogger Ed Kilgore in 2015.

===&quot;The Cut&quot;===

&quot;The Cut&quot; launched on the &quot;New York&quot; website in 2008, edited by Amy Odell, to replace a previous fashion week blog, &quot;Show &amp; Talk&quot;. In 2012 it became a standalone website, shifting focus from fashion to women&#x27;s issues more generally. Stella Bugbee became editor-in-chief in 2017, and presided over a relaunch that appeared on August 21. The new site was designed for an enhanced mobile-first experience and to better reflect the topics covered. In January 2018, &quot;The Cut&quot; published Moira Donegan&#x27;s essay revealing her as the creator of the controversial &quot;Shitty Media Men&quot; list, a viral but short-lived anonymous spreadsheet crowdsourcing unconfirmed reports of sexual misconduct by men in journalism. That August, the site also published &quot;Everywhere and Nowhere,&quot; Lindsay Peoples&#x27;s essay about the fashion industry&#x27;s inhospitability to Black voices and points of view. In 2019, &quot;The Cut&quot; published an excerpt from E. Jean Carroll&#x27;s book, &quot;What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,&quot; mostly about Donald J. Trump&#x27;s sexual assault on her. In 2021, Peoples became the site&#x27;s next editor-in-chief. &quot;The Cut&quot; also incorporates the pop-science rubric &quot;Science of Us&quot;, which previously existed as a standalone site. In 2024, &#x27;The Cut&#x27; published an article in which a woman confessed to abusing and neglecting her pet cat, Lucky. Advocates take to social media by storm seeking justice for Lucky.

===&quot;Grub Street&quot;===
&quot;Grub Street&quot;, covering food and restaurants, was expanded in 2009 to five additional cities served by former nymag.com sister site MenuPages.com. In 2013 &quot;Grub Street&quot; announced that it would close its city blogs outside New York and bring a more national focus to GrubStreet.com.

===&quot;Vulture&quot;===

&quot;Vulture&quot; was launched as a pop culture blog on NYMag.com in 2007. It moved to an independent web address, Vulture.com, in 2012. In 2018, New York Media acquired the comedy news blog &quot;Splitsider&quot;, folding the operation into the &quot;Vulture&quot; website.

=== &quot;The Strategist&quot; ===
In 2016, &quot;New York&quot; launched the &quot;Strategist&quot;, an expansion of a column from the print version of &quot;New York&quot; Magazine that aimed to help readers navigate shopping from the &quot;New York&quot; perspective. The site joined other product review sites focusing on providing free product reviews to readers, generating affiliate commissions when readers would purchase a product they recommended. The early editorial team included editors David Haskell and Alexis Swerdloff. Popular recurring franchises include the celebrity-shopping &quot;What I Can&#x27;t Live Without&quot; series, &quot;Strategist-Approved&quot; gift guides, and beauty reviews by influencer Rio Viera-Newton. The &quot;Strategist&quot; does not publish branded content that is paid for by the subject of a story, but it earns revenue through affiliate advertising, including the Amazon Associates Program. In 2018, the &quot;Strategist&quot; experimented with a holiday pop-up shop called I Found It at the Strategist.

=== &quot;Curbed&quot; ===
In 2020, &quot;New York&quot; took over the Vox Media website &quot;Curbed&quot;, which had begun by covering New York City real estate and development since 2005 and had grown to cover urbanism and design news in many American cities. That October, Curbed relaunched as a &quot;New York&quot; vertical with a new design and a resharpened focus on New York City. Its prominent writers include the Pulitzer Prize–winner Justin Davidson, the magazine&#x27;s architecture critic, and Wendy Goodman, its design editor.

<text>Lloyds Bank plc is a major British retail and commercial bank with a significant presence across England and Wales. It has traditionally been regarded one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; clearing banks.

Established in Birmingham in 1765, Lloyds Bank expanded considerably during the 19th and 20th centuries, acquiring several smaller banks along the way. It merged with the Trustee Savings Bank in 1995 and operated as Lloyds TSB Bank plc from 1999 to 2013. In January 2009, it became a key subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group following the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB Group. The bank&#x27;s operational headquarters are in London, with additional offices in Wales and Scotland, and it also manages office complexes, brand headquarters, and data centres in Birmingham, Yorkshire, Leeds, Sheffield, Halifax, and Wolverhampton.

==History==

===Origins===

The origins of Lloyds Bank date from 1765, when button maker John Taylor and Quaker iron producer and dealer Sampson Lloyd set up a private banking business in Dale End, Birmingham. The first branch office opened in Oldbury, some six miles (10 km) west of Birmingham, in 1864.

The association with the Taylor family ended in 1852 and, in 1865, Lloyds &amp; Co. converted into a joint-stock company known as Lloyds Banking Company Ltd. The first report of the company in 1865 stated:LLOYDS BANKING COMPANY LIMITED – Authorized Capital £2,000,000. FOUNDED ON The Private Banks of Messrs. Lloyds &amp; Co. and Messrs. Moilliet and Sons, with-which have subsequently been amalgamated with the Banks of Messrs. P. H. Williams, Wednesbury, and Messrs.Stevenson, Salt, &amp; Co., Stafford and Lichfield. [They had an office at 20 Lombard St., London] Your Directors have the satisfaction to report that they have concluded an agreement with the well-known and old-established firm of Messrs. Stevenson, Salt &amp; Company for the amalgamation with this Company of their Banking Business at Stafford, Lichfield, Rugeley, and Eccleshall, and that this agreement has had the unanimous approval of the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 31st January last. It will be again submitted to you for final confirmation after the close of the Ordinary General Meeting. TIMOTHY KENRICK, Chairman. BIRMINGHAM, 9th February 1866Two sons of the original partners followed in their footsteps by joining the established merchant bank Barnett, Hoares &amp; Co. which later became Barnetts, Hoares, Hanbury, and Lloyd— based in Lombard Street, London. Eventually, this became absorbed into the original Lloyds Banking Company, which became Lloyds, Barnetts, and Bosanquets Bank Ltd. in 1884. and, finally, Lloyds Bank Limited in 1889.

=== Symbols ===
The symbol adopted by Taylors and Lloyds was the beehive, representing industry and hard work (thrift). In 1822, Taylors and Lloyds sent a letter to other banks to inform them of stolen banknotes, adding that it would engrave a symbol of a beehive to all future notes. Dowler &amp; Sons made brass buttons embellished with beehives for branch messenger uniforms in the 1900s. Uniform buttons featuring a black horse with small beehives engraved around it were manufactured in the 1930s.

The black horse regardant device dates from 1677, when Humphrey Stokes adopted it as a sign for his shop. The reason why Stokes chose this horse is unknown, though it may have been a family crest because the black horse is heraldically posed in &#x27;rampant regardant&#x27;. Stokes was a goldsmith and &quot;keeper of the running cashes&quot; (an early term for banker) and the business became part of Barnett, Hoares &amp; Co. When Lloyds took over that bank in 1884, it continued to trade &quot;at the sign of the black horse&quot;. 

The green of the Lloyds Bank was adopted in the 1920s for added distinctiveness.

From 1884 to the 1920s, the black horse and the beehive were both used in cheques, until the beehive was dropped. During this period, other symbols were used; for example, the liver bird, which was retained from the Liverpool Union Bank when it was taken over in 1900.

Since 1975, real black horses have been featured in Lloyds&#x27; television adverts, including Cancara.
===Expansion===
Through a series of mergers, including Cunliffe, Brooks in 1900, the Wilts. and Dorset Bank in 1914 and, by far the largest, the Capital and Counties Bank in 1918, Lloyds emerged to become one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; clearing banks in the United Kingdom. By 1923, Lloyds Bank had made some 50 takeovers, one of which was the last private firm to issue its own banknotes—Fox, Fowler and Company of Wellington, Somerset. Today, the Bank of England has a monopoly of banknote issue in England and Wales. In 2011, the company founded SGH Martineau LLP.

Eleven banks bought by Lloyds Bank between 1865 and 1923 had been involved in slavery to some degree. One of these, the London and Brazilian Bank, financed coffee plantations in Brazil which operated on slave labour, and mortgages on these plantations were sometimes secured using the monetary value of the enslaved people as collateral.

In 1968, an attempt to merge with Barclays and Martins Bank failed because the Monopolies and Mergers Commission deemed it to be against the public interest. Barclays finally acquired Martins the following year. In 1972, Lloyds Bank was a founding member of the Joint Credit Card Company (with National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank and the National and Commercial Banking Group) which launched the Access credit card (now MasterCard). That same year it introduced &quot;Cashpoint&quot;, the first online cash machine to use plastic cards with a magnetic stripe. In popular use, the &quot;Cashpoint&quot; trademark has become a generic term for an ATM in the United Kingdom.

In 1982 Lloyds decided to follow Provident Financial Group plc in entering the estate agency market with the acquisition of the Norfolk firm of Charles Hawkins and Son in May of that year to form Black Horse Agencies. The firm had been first established in 1869 in Downham Market by Charles Hawkins who was land agent for the Pratt estate at Ryston. The firm merged in 1875 with that of Cruso and Son forming Cruso and Hawkins, later becoming Charles Hawkins and Son in 1908.

Under the leadership of Sir Brian Pitman between 1984 and 1997, the bank became an early adopter of shareholder value creation as a governing corporate objective. The bank&#x27;s business focus was narrowed and it reacted to disastrous lending to South American states by trimming its overseas businesses and seeking growth through mergers with other UK banks. During this period, Pitman tried unsuccessfully to acquire The Royal Bank of Scotland in 1984, Standard Chartered in 1986, and Midland Bank in 1992. Lloyds Bank International merged into Lloyds Bank in 1986, since there was no longer an advantage in operating separately. In 1988, Lloyds merged five of its businesses with the Abbey Life Insurance Company to create Lloyds Abbey Life.

===Lloyds TSB===

The bank merged first with the newly demutualised Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society (C&amp;G), then with the TSB Group in 1995. The C&amp;G acquisition gave Lloyds a large stake in the UK mortgage lending market. The TSB merger was structured as a reverse takeover; Lloyds Bank Plc was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and TSB Group plc was renamed Lloyds TSB Group plc on 28 December, with former Lloyds Bank shareholders owning a 70% equity interest in the share capital, effected through a scheme of arrangement. The new bank commenced trading in 1999 after the statutory process of integration was completed. On 28 June, TSB Bank plc transferred engagements to Lloyds Bank Plc which then changed its name to Lloyds TSB Bank plc; at the same time, TSB Bank Scotland plc absorbed Lloyds&#x27; three Scottish branches becoming Lloyds TSB Scotland plc. The combined business formed the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest to Midland Bank (now HSBC) by market capitalisation. Lloyds&#x27; iconic black horse device was retained and modified to reflect the TSB merger.

Lloyds Abbey Life became a wholly owned subsidiary of the group in 1996, absorbing Hill Samuel in 1997, before closing to a new business in 2000. In 2007, Abbey Life was sold to Deutsche Bank for £977 million.

In 1999, the group agreed to buy the Scottish Widows Fund and Life Assurance Society for £7 billion. The society demutualised in 2000, shortly before the acquisition was completed. In 2001, Lloyds TSB made a bid to acquire Abbey National; however, the bid was blocked by the Competition Commission, who ruled that a merger would be against the public interest.

In October 2011, Lloyds TSB&#x27;s credit rating was reduced by Moody&#x27;s from Aa3 to A1. The action was taken in the light of a shift in government policy to move risk from taxpayers to creditors by reducing the level of support offered to financial institutions.

Lloyds TSB was the first Official Partner for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

===Divestment and return to Lloyds Bank===

After the 2008 rescue of HBOS, Lloyds TSB Group was renamed Lloyds Banking Group. In 2009, following the liquidity crisis, HM Government took a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group. The European Commission ruled that the group must sell a portion of its business by November 2013, as it categorised the stake purchase as state aid.

On 24 April 2013, it was confirmed that a number of Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales would be combined with the branches of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and the business of Lloyds TSB Scotland to form a new bank operating under the TSB brand and divested by the group. The selected Lloyds TSB branches and those of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester were transferred to Lloyds TSB Scotland plc, which was renamed TSB Bank plc. The new bank began operating on 9 September 2013 as a separate division within Lloyds Banking Group. TSB was floated on the London Stock Exchange on 20 June 2014, and was acquired by Banco Sabadell one year later and subsequently delisted. The remaining business of Lloyds TSB returned to the Lloyds Bank name on 23 September 2013.

In October 2014, the bank announced that it planned to cut 9,000 jobs and close some branches in light of an increase in the number of customers using online banking services.

In July 2016, the bank announced it would cut 3,000 jobs because of the economic downturn as a result of United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. On 17 March 2017, the British Government confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group had been sold.

In January 2017, the bank suffered interruptions to its online services originally blamed on &quot;unspecified technical glitches&quot;. A hacker reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack, demanding around £75,000 from the bank in a &quot;consultation fee&quot;.

==Services==
The bank offers a full range of banking and financial services, through a network of 1,300 branches in England and Wales. Branches in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are operated by Lloyds Bank International Limited, while Lloyds Bank (Gibraltar) Limited operates in Gibraltar; both are wholly owned subsidiaries and trade under the Lloyds Bank brand.

==Controversies==


===Payment protection insurance===
In November 2005 an investigation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) highlighted a lack of compliance controls surrounding payment protection insurance (PPI). A second investigation in October 2006 identified further evidence of poor compliance and major PPI providers including Lloyds were fined for not treating customers fairly. In January 2011 a High Court case began which in the following April ruled against the banks, on 5 May 2011 Lloyds withdrew from the legal challenge. In 2012, Lloyds announced that they had set aside £3.6 billion to cover the cost of compensating customers who were mis-sold PPI.

In March 2014 it was reported that Lloyds had been reducing the compensation they offered by using a regulatory provision called &quot;alternative redress&quot; to assume that customers wrongly sold single-premium PPI policies would have bought a cheaper, regular premium PPI policy instead.

In June 2015 the Lloyds Banking Group was fined £117m for mishandling payment protection insurance claims including many claims being &quot;unfairly rejected&quot;.

===Links to arms trade===
In December 2008 the British anti-poverty charity War on Want released a report documenting the extent to which the UK high street banks invest in, provide banking services for and lend to arms companies. The report stated that Lloyds TSB is the only high street bank whose corporate social responsibility policy does not mention the arms industry, yet is that industry&#x27;s second-largest shareholder among high street banks.

===Tax evasion===
In 2009, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; alleged that Lloyds TSB Offshore in Jersey, Channel Islands was encouraging wealthy customers to evade tax. An employee of Lloyds was filmed telling a customer how several mechanisms could be used to make their transactions invisible to the UK tax authorities. This action is also in breach of money laundering regulations in Jersey.

===Retail conduct failings===
In December 2013, Lloyds Banking Group had been fined £28m for &quot;serious failings&quot; in relation to bonus schemes for sales staff. The Financial Conduct Authority said it was the largest fine that it or the former Financial Services Authority had imposed for retail conduct failings. The bonus scheme pressured staff to hit sales targets or risk being demoted and have their pay cut, the FCA said. Lloyds Bank has accepted the regulator&#x27;s findings and apologised to its customers.

===Divestment of government-owned shares===
Based on figures from the National Audit Office, George Osborne&#x27;s sale of a 6% tranche of Lloyds shares in autumn 2013—despite his claims that the sale had netted a profit—worked out at a loss of at least £230m for UK taxpayers. However, after the British Government confirmed all its remaining shares had been sold on 17 May 2017, Lloyds Bank said the government had seen a return of £21.2bil on its investment, an approximately £900m profit.

===Libor rate manipulations===
In July 2014, US and UK regulators imposed a combined £218 million ($370 million) in fines on Lloyds and a number of subsidiaries over the bank&#x27;s part in the global Libor rate-fixing scandal, and other rate manipulations and false reporting.

===Phishing scams===
A number of phishing email scams have been engineered in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 into making the recipient believe that they are receiving an email from Lloyds Bank or Lloyds TSB. Though these emails have had nothing to do with the bank per se, they often are sent by official-looking email IDs with the bank&#x27;s domain name. Typically, they contain an authentication code which is sent as a distractor. The linked pages usually allow the recipient to enter their personal information related to the bank, leading to their bank accounts being hacked.

In November 2024, Lloyds Banking Group faces increasing pressure from MPs, business groups, and a staff union to release the full, unredacted findings of the Dame Linda Dobbs review investigating a £1 billion fraud at HBOS, with critics demanding transparency and accountability for the long-delayed report.

<text>Naro , also Nharo, is a Khoe language spoken in Ghanzi District of Botswana and in eastern Namibia. It is one of the most-spoken of the Tshu–Khwe languages. Naro is a trade language among speakers of different Khoe languages in Ghanzi District. There exists a dictionary.

==Phonology==
Naro has the following consonant inventory (in the IPA) as described by Miller (2011), whereas the orthographic symbols were proposed by Visser (2001):

The phonemes and (spelt ⟨kg⟩ and ⟨kgʼ⟩) only contrast for some speakers: &quot;kgʼám&quot; ‘mouth’ vs. &quot;kgʼáù&quot; ‘male’. The flap /ɾ/ only occurs word-medially except in loan words. The lateral /l/ is only found in loans, and is generally substituted by medially, and by initially. Medial and may be and ; they occur initially only in &quot;wèé&quot; ‘all, both’ and in &quot;yèè&quot; (an interjection).

=== Vowels ===
Naro has five vowel qualities, /a e i o u/&quot;,&quot; which may occur long (/aː eː iː oː uː/ spelt ⟨aa ee ii oo uu⟩)&quot;,&quot; nasalized &quot;(/&quot;ã ẽ ĩ õ ũ/&quot;),&quot; pharyngealized &quot;(&quot;/aˤ eˤ iˤ oˤ uˤ/ , spelt ⟨a̱ e̱ i̱ o̱ u̱⟩, and combinations of these (/ãˤ ẽː/ ⟨ã̱ ẽe⟩ etc.). There are three tones: high, mid, and low

=== Syllable structure ===
Syllables are in general simple in Naro, with the maximal shape CV(V)C&quot;,&quot; where VV is a long vowel or diphthong. The only consonant that occurs in coda position is , as in &quot;xám̀&quot; ‘to smell’. However, long nasal vowels such as may occur with an excrescent as in . Syllabic also occur, as in &quot;nna.&quot; Nasals such as can also form syllable nuclei, as in .

== Orthography ==
Naro orthography uses the Latin alphabet, and is partially based on the systems for Zulu and Xhosa, especially as far as clicks are represented. Digraphs are used for clicks, and to represent affricates. Vowel length is represented by doubling of the vowel, whereas the orthography utilizes the tilde to represent nasality (⟨ã ẽ ĩ õ ũ⟩), and underline to represent pharyngealization. Tones are written with diacritics both on vowels and nasal consonants, with the exception of the mid tone, which is not represented (e.g. ⟨á a à ḿ m̀ ń ǹ⟩)&quot;.&quot;

Below is an overview of Naro clicks in both orthography and IPA (Visser 2001). The dental click is represented by &quot;c&quot;. alveolar click by &quot;q&quot;, palatal click by &quot;tc&quot;, and lateral click by &quot;x&quot;. All examples are from Visser (2001).

==Dialects==
Naro is a dialect cluster.

==Naro Language Project==
The Naro Language Project is a project currently being undertaken by the Reformed Church in D&#x27;kar that aims to describe and develop an understanding of the Naro language, increase literacy by teaching Naro speakers to read and write their language and translate the Bible into Naro. The project was started in the 1980s. The Naro language project has, as of 2007, translated 70% of the Bible into the Naro language.

==Numerals==
Below are Naro numerals, from Visser (2001). Only &#x27;one&#x27;, &#x27;two&#x27;, and &#x27;three&#x27; are native Naro numerals, while the rest have been borrowed from Nama. Orthography is given first, followed by IPA in brackets.

<doc id="714710" wikidata="Q170804" url="?curid=714710" title="Weber (unit)">
<text>In physics, the weber ( ; symbol: Wb) is the unit of magnetic flux in the International System of Units (SI). The unit is derived (through Faraday&#x27;s law of induction) from the relationship (volt-second). A magnetic flux density of 1 Wb/m2 (one weber per square metre) is one tesla.

The weber is named after the German physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804–1891).

== Definition ==

The weber may be defined in terms of Faraday&#x27;s law, which relates a changing magnetic flux through a loop to the electric field around the loop. A change in flux of one weber per second will induce an electromotive force of one volt (produce an electric potential difference of one volt across two open-circuited terminals).

Officially:
That is:
formula_1

One weber is also the total magnetic flux across a surface of one square meter perpendicular to a magnetic flux density of one tesla; that is,
formula_2

Expressed only in SI base units, 1 weber is:
formula_3

The weber is used in the definition of the henry as 1 weber per ampere, and consequently can be expressed as the product of those units:
formula_4
The weber is commonly expressed in a multitude of other units:
formula_5

where Ω is ohm, C is coulomb, J is joule, and N is newton.

== History ==
In 1861, the British Association for the Advancement of Science (known as &quot;The BA&quot;) established a committee under William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) to study electrical units. In a February 1902 manuscript, with handwritten notes of Oliver Heaviside, Giovanni Giorgi proposed a set of rational units of electromagnetism including the weber, noting that &quot;the product of the volt into the second has been called the &quot;weber&quot; by the B. A.&quot;

The International Electrotechnical Commission began work on terminology in 1909 and established Technical Committee 1 in 1911, its oldest established committee, &quot;to sanction the terms and definitions used in the different electrotechnical fields and to determine the equivalence of the terms used in the different languages.&quot; 

In 1930, TC1 decided that the magnetic field strength (H) is of a different nature from the magnetic flux density (B), and took up the question of naming the units for these fields and related quantities, among them the integral of magnetic flux density.

In 1935, TC 1 recommended names for several electrical units, including the weber for the practical unit of magnetic flux (and the maxwell for the CGS unit).
Also in 1935, TC1 passed responsibility for &quot;electric and magnetic magnitudes and units&quot; to the new TC24. This &quot;led eventually to the universal adoption of the Giorgi system, which unified electromagnetic units with the MKS dimensional system of units, the whole now known simply as the SI system ().&quot;

In 1938, TC24 &quot;recommended as a connecting link [from mechanical to electrical units] the permeability of free space with the value of This group also recognized that any one of the practical units already in use (ohm, ampere, volt, henry, farad, coulomb, and weber), could equally serve as the fourth fundamental unit. &quot;After consultation, the ampere was adopted as the fourth unit of the Giorgi system in Paris in 1950.&quot;

== Multiples == 

Like other SI units, the weber can modified by adding a prefix that multiplies it by a power of 10.
== Conversions ==
* One maxwell (Mx), the CGS unit of magnetic flux, equals 10−8 Wb

<text>Deborah Elizabeth Meyer (born August 14, 1952), also known by her married name Deborah Meyer Weber, is an American former competition swimmer, a 1968 three-time Olympic champion, and a former world record-holder in five freestyle events, 200,400,800,1500 meters and 880yd freestyle. 

== Early life ==

Despite being born in 1952 in Annapolis Md and living in Haddonfield New Jersey during childhood she moved with her family to warm and sunny Sacramento, California, when her father was transferred with Campbell Soup. She attended Sacramento&#x27;s Rio Americano High School, and was trained during her High School years and beyond by Hall of Fame Coach Sherm Chavoor at the Arden Hills Swim Club in Carmichael, as were fellow 1968 U.S. team swimming Olympians Mark Spitz, Michael J. Burton, John Ferris, Sue Peterson, and John Nelson. Chavoor was one of the early coaches to challenge young elite women swimmers with &quot;overdistance training&quot;, which focused on workouts that gave more total yardage and often featured mid-range and distance intervals to build greater endurance and speed. 

Chavoor would also serve as Head Coach of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Olympic swim team in 1968 where he would again coach Meyer, who may have had greater confidence, and focus having Chavoor manage her at the Olympics.
==1968 Mexico City Olympics==
In 1968, the women&#x27;s freestyle races at 200-meter and 800-meter distances were added to the Summer Olympics for the first time, giving Meyer, a freestyle specialist, two new events where she could dominate the competition. Prior to 1968, the longest race for women was the 400-meter freestyle. In contrast, the male competitors had had the 1,500-meter freestyle race (the metric mile) for decades, dating back to 1896.

Demonstrating unusual dominance in freestyle distance, Meyer set world records in the 200-meter, and 800-meter freestyle swimming events at the 1968 U.S. Olympics trials. As the first woman swimmer to participate in the 800-meter Olympic event, Meyer opened the doors for women to compete in events that had been closed to them and demonstrated that with proper training women could compete at the same distances as the men&#x27;s teams. 
Meyer had obstacles to overcome in the 68 Olympics, as she had developed a stomach ailment in Mexico City and had just recovered from a painful bout of bursitis in her left shoulder. Competing as a favorite in all three events, Meyer met and exceeded expectations despite her ailments and took gold in the 200-, 400-, and 800-meter freestyle races becoming the first swimmer to win three individual gold medals in one Olympics. Katie Ledecky is the only other female swimmer to have one all three events in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. Despite competing at the high altitude of Mexico City, her winning times at the Olympic Games were 2:10.5 for the 200-meter, 4:31.8 for the 400-meter, and 9:24.0 for the 800-meter distances, all of them new or first-time Olympic records. 

With strong contributions by Meyer, Coach Sherm Chavoor&#x27;s 1968 U.S. women&#x27;s Olympic team won ten of a possible fifteen gold medals, eight silver of a possible twelve, and eight bronze of a possible twelve. In total, the U.S. women captured twenty-six medals out of a possible thirty-nine.

While overcoming her problems with asthma, Meyer broke 15 world records in swimming during her career. She broke 24 American records and won 19 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) national championships. Reluctant to continue training for the 1972 Olympics, Meyer retired from competitive swimming in 1970. She would attend UCLA, but not as a swimmer.

===Coaching and personal===
Meyer is married to Bill Weber, and has a daughter, son, and step-daughter. She owns the Debbie Meyer Swim School in Carmichael, California. According to the business website, Meyer has taught swimming in the area around Sacramento, since the 1970s, and she opened her own school in 1993. Along with teaching both children and adults to be safe in the water Meyer is coaching the Truckee Tahoe Swim Team in Truckee, California. As a tribute to her athletic successes, she uses the custom California automobile license plate &quot;3GOLD68&quot;.

===Honors===
Befitting her many records and achievements in both national and international competition, particularly in the late 1960&#x27;s, Meyer was the recipient of many honors. In 1968, she won the James E. Sullivan Award, given to the greatest athlete of the year. In 1969, she was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year. As an ongoing honor, she was recognized as &quot;Swimming World&quot;&#x27;s World Swimmer of the Year in 1967, 1968 and 1969. Among her more selective honors, Meyer was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1977, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1986. 
These honors may have been bestowed partly as a result of her being the first woman to win three Olympic gold medals, and her continued dedication to the sport of swimming through her years as a coach.

On July 5, 2004, Meyer was inducted into the American National High School Hall of Fame.

<doc id="714718" wikidata="Q1660669" url="?curid=714718" title="Lieutenant Governor of Ohio">
<text>The position of lieutenant governor of Ohio was established in 1852. The lieutenant governor becomes governor if the governor resigns, dies in office or is removed via impeachment conviction. Before 1852, the president of the Ohio State Senate would serve as acting governor if a vacancy in the governorship occurred. Until 1978, lieutenant governors were elected separately but concurrently with the governor (not on a &quot;ticket&quot;). Thus, there were several occasions when the lieutenant governor was from a different party than the governor. This was changed by constitutional amendment. In 1974, Richard F. Celeste was the last lieutenant governor to be elected separately. In 1978, George Voinovich became the first lieutenant governor to be elected on the same ticket with the governor.

From 1852 to 1979, the lieutenant governor also served as the president of the Ohio State Senate. More recently, Ohio governors have generally named the lieutenant governor to head an agency of state government. An example of this is Bruce Edward Johnson, who served as Director of the Ohio Department of Development, as did his successor, Lee Fisher. Recent Lt. Governor Mary Taylor was the director of the Ohio Department of Insurance, until she was replaced by Jillian Froment in 2017.

<text>Southern England, also known as the South of England or the South, is a sub-national part of England. Officially, it is made up of the southern, south-western and part of the eastern parts of England, consisting of the statistical regions of London, the South East, the South West and the East. The region also shares a border with Wales to the far North West, Altogether, it forms a population of nearly 28 million and an area of .

Southern England has cultural, economic and political differences from both the Midlands (which borders it to its north) and the North of England; the Midlands form a dialect chain in a notable north–south divide of England. The South is considerably wealthier and politically influential as opposed to the North. Within the South itself, multiple influences shape geographic and political divisions, defined by closeness to the capital; Greater London itself, its surrounding Home Counties and outer areas, as well as East Anglia and the West Country. Greater London is by far the most populous county in Southern England, followed by Hampshire, Kent and Essex. On the other hand, Bristol is the largest city in the South excluding London.

==Definitions==
For official purposes, the UK government does not refer to Southern England as a single entity, but the Office for National Statistics divides UK into twelve regions. In England, the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber make up the North (&quot;centre-north&quot;); the West Midlands and East Midlands (as well as Wales) make up the Midlands (&quot;centre-south&quot;) and the rest of England make up the South.

Culturally speaking, the majority of people think that the South consists of the South East (92%), Greater London (88%), South West (87%), and to lesser extent the East of England (57%). However, 35% of people surveyed placed the East of England as part of the Midlands. Generally people in the North tend to put the East of England in the South more than people in the South or Midlands.

The Home Counties identify in a similar way to the neighbouring Midlands, in this case sharing culture with London and the outer areas yet identifying as separate from each.

== Geography ==

The South contains approximately a quarter of the United Kingdom&#x27;s area. The geographic split is north-east (fenlands), south (downlands and a coastal plain) and west (following the River Thames to the Bristol channel and a peninsula).

The South has land borders with Wales and the English Midlands and a sea border with France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

The South is generally more low-lying than the North. There are a number of hill ranges, such as the Cotswolds and the Chilterns. The highest point in the South is High Willhays , located in Devon within Dartmoor National Park.

=== Largest cities and settlements ===
London is the largest city in the South of England and is the capital of the United Kingdom. The London Metropolitan Area has a population of 14.2 million (2019), making it the largest metropolitan area in Europe.

The table below shows the urban areas in the region with a population of at least 250,000.
==Demographics==
=== Wealth and class ===

Broadly speaking, Southern England is considerably wealthier than the Midlands and the North. The South East England region was found to have the highest concentration of high-wealth families in the country, followed by London. Studies have shown that the areas making up Surrey and Sussex are the wealthiest in Britain based on the value of assets owned by the average resident. Many of the home counties in particular have been considered to be &quot;posh&quot;, including Surrey, Oxfordshire and Hertfordshire, based on factors such as number of golf clubs, independent schools, and noted &quot;beautiful&quot; countryside villages. Additionally, the single wealthiest district in Britain, based on residents&#x27;s income, is London&#x27;s Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. As many as eight of the top ten are districts of London, with the remaining two being Borough of Guildford and Borough of Elmbridge, both within the London commuter belt. The &quot;least deprived&quot; neighbourhood in England has been found to be near Amersham in the county of Buckinghamshire, in the South of England.

However, despite overall higher wealth in the regions of Southern England, there also exist highly impoverished areas here. Cornwall, in the South West, is one of the poorest counties in England based on income. The town of Jaywick, in Essex, was found to be England&#x27;s single most deprived neighbourhood. Many London boroughs were also found to be highly deprived, including Kensington and Chelsea where significant wealth inequality exists. Numerous other districts in the South also ranked among the country&#x27;s most deprived in these statistics including Swale, Thanet, Hastings and Great Yarmouth.

=== Language ===

==== English ====

English is the native language of the English people and the main language spoken in the South. The South of England has a dialect and accent distinct from that of other parts of the UK. Due to the prominence of the South in media and politics, Standard British English is largely based on the English spoken in the South. For example, the standard British accent, Received Pronunciation, is very similar to the educated speech of London, Oxford and Cambridge.

Standard Southern British English, a &quot;modern&quot; form of Received Pronunciation, is now considered to be the most commonly spoken form of English in much of the South. Estuary English has grown to become one of the most spoken dialects in London and counties including Kent and Essex. London&#x27;s expansion has also affected language and dialect in surrounding areas of Southern England, such as the north-east fenlands in East Anglia; the traditional Cockney dialect&#x27;s population of London&#x27;s East End has moved out to the north and east Home Counties with a knock on effect to East Anglia&#x27;s population, which itself has had its own long time dialect, East Anglian English.

In the South West of England, West Country English is a common regional dialect and is the only rhotic dialect spoken in Southern England.

==== Cornish ====
Cornish is a revived language spoken in Cornwall and is an important part of the identity and culture of the Cornish people.

===People===
People often apply the terms &quot;southern&quot; and &quot;south&quot; loosely, without deeper consideration of the geographical identities of Southern England. This can cause confusion over the depth of affiliation between its areas. As in much of the rest of England, people tend to have a deeper affiliation to their county or city. Thus, residents of Essex are unlikely to feel much affinity with people in Oxfordshire. Similarly, there is a strong distinction between natives of the south-west and south-east. The broadcaster Stuart Maconie has noted that culturally &quot;there&#x27;s a bottom half of England [...] but there isn&#x27;t a south in the same way that there&#x27;s a north&quot;.

===Health===

One major manifestation of the North–South divide is in health and life expectancy statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. The South of England has a higher life expectancy than the North, however, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993. Furthermore, all such figures represent an average – affluent northern towns such as Harrogate have higher life expectancies than less affluent areas of the South such as Southampton or Plymouth.

==Education==
The South of England has a number of world-renowned universities, such as the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and many Russell Group universities, such as Imperial College London, University of Exeter and the London School of Economics.

==Sport==
===Football===
The South Coast Derby is used to describe football matches played mainly between Portsmouth Football Club and Southampton Football Club. However, in Portsmouth&#x27;s absence from top flight football, AFC Bournemouth and Brighton and Hove Albion – based about and from Southampton respectively – gained promotion to the Premier League, with some media outlets marketing fixtures against them as a South Coast derby;

Other major derbies in Southern England are West Country derbies and London derbies.

===Rugby===

Rugby union is the dominant code played in the south with a minor rugby league presence. One of the biggest derbies is the West Country derby (Bath v Gloucester).

<text>Spezi () is the brand name for a soft drink owned by Brauhaus Riegele in Augsburg, Germany. Spezi is a genericized trademark and the name is used as a generic term for a mixture of cola and orange soda (orangeade) in most German-speaking countries.

When the brand was registered in 1956, Riegele at first sold beer under the trademark. Since the 1970s, Spezi has been produced and bottled by different local breweries under a franchising agreement. The first Original Spezi Cola Orange TV commercial aired in 1989.

Paulaner also sells a similar product called &quot;Paulaner Spezi&quot; in Germany based on an agreement with Riegele from 1974 that a German court declared still valid in 2022. The same product is available in the US under the name &quot;Paulaner Sunset&quot;.

Most large beverage manufacturers sell similar products, though mostly in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Examples are &quot;Schwip Schwap&quot; by PepsiCo or &quot;Mezzo Mix&quot; by the Coca-Cola Company though most grocery store chains sell generic brand versions of the drink as well, usually called &quot;Cola-Mix&quot;. 

Spezi contains water, glucose-fructose syrup, sugar, orange juice concentrate (2.3%), lemon juice from lemon juice concentrate (0.8%), carbon dioxide, caramel color, phosphoric acid and citric acid, natural flavoring, caffeine, citrus extract, locust bean gum (stabilizer). There are also different versions, including a sugar-free one.

<text>The European University Association (EUA) represents more than 800 institutions of higher education in 48 countries, providing them with a forum for cooperation and the exchange of information on higher education and research policies. Members of the Association are European universities involved in teaching and research, national associations of rectors, and other organisations active in higher education and research.

EUA is the result of a merger between the Association of European Universities and the Confederation of European Union Rectors&#x27; Conferences. The merger took place in Salamanca on 31 March 2001.

==Membership==
The following is a breakdown of EUA membership between EU and other countries:

Some universities in Kosovo are listed as &quot;Individual Full Members&quot; or &quot;Individual Associate Members&quot;.

In March 2022, the EUA suspended 12 Russian members following the 2022 address of the Russian Union of Rectors (RUR) supporting the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, for being &quot;diametrically opposed to the European values that they committed to when joining EUA&quot;.

<doc id="714769" wikidata="Q5343256" url="?curid=714769" title="Edward H. Watson">
<text>Edward Howe Watson (February 28, 1874 – January 7, 1942) was a career United States Navy officer, who led a squadron of destroyers aground off Point Honda on the California coast in 1923.

==Early life and marriage==
Watson was born in Frankfort, Kentucky, a son of U.S. Navy Commander John Crittenden Watson. He married Hermine Cary Gratz, whose half-sister, Helen Gratz, married Godfrey S. Rockefeller of Greenwich, Connecticut.

==Navy career==

===Academy and early career===
Watson graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1895 and served on several ships during the rest of the decade, including Spanish–American War service on board the cruiser . He attended the Naval War College in 1908. Watson commanded the storeship in 1912–13, then returned to the Naval War College to attend the long course, graduating in 1914. He also saw duty as executive officer of the battleship and as Commanding Officer of the gunboat .

===World War I===

During World War I, he commanded the troop transport USS &quot;Madawaska&quot; from August 1917 to January 1918. CAPT Watson was then in command of the battleship , receiving the Navy Cross &quot;for exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. &quot;Alabama&quot; in the Atlantic Fleet&quot;. In March 1919, he became U.S. Naval Attaché in Japan, remaining in that post until May 1922. In July of that year, he took command of Destroyer Squadron 11, based on the West Coast.

===Honda Point disaster===
On September 8, 1923, dead reckoning navigation errors on Watson&#x27;s flagship led seven of his squadron&#x27;s destroyers to ground on the rocky coast at Honda Point, California, a loss that came to be known as the Honda Point Disaster. Watson was court martialed for his role.

Not all observers agreed with the Navy&#x27;s decision to punish Watson. In 1960, the authors of &quot;Tragedy at Honda&quot; argued that the causes of the tragedy lay in the failure of new technology from a navigational radio station to supply necessary data to ships operating in dense fog, but that Watson displayed outstanding honor and leadership by taking full responsibility, quoting at length the editors of the &quot;Army and Navy Journal&quot;, who wrote at the time of the court martial:

===Post-Honda Point career and retirement===
After the Honda Point disaster, Captain Watson served as Assistant Commandant of the Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii until he left active duty in November 1929.

He retired to New York City, where he was in the New York Social Register. He and his family spent their summers on Walcott Avenue in Jamestown, Rhode Island, where he was a member of the Conanicut Yacht Club.

==Death==
Watson died in 1942 at the Brooklyn Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="714771" wikidata="Q12631978" url="?curid=714771" title="Gǀui dialect">
<text>Gǀui or Gǀwi (pronounced in English, and also spelled &quot;ǀGwi, ǀ᪶Ui, Dcui, Gcwi,&quot; or &quot;Cgui&quot;) is a Khoe dialect of Botswana with 2,500 speakers (2004 Cook). It is part of the Gǁana dialect cluster, and is closely related to Naro. It has a number of loan words from ǂʼAmkoe. Gǀui, ǂʼAmkoe, and Taa form the core of the Kalahari Basin sprachbund, and share a number of characteristic features, including extremely large consonant inventories.

==Phonology==
Gǀui has 93 consonants (with 56 clicks) or 52 consonants (and 20 clicks), depending on analysis. There are ten vowels, and two to six tones, again depending on analysis.

===Clicks===
Gǀui has 24 simple click consonants, plus complex clicks variously analyzed as consonant clusters or airstream contours. As with many of the Tshu–Khwe languages, clicks have lost some of their importance under the influence of neighboring Bantu languages. Many words which previously began with clicks (as shown by cognates in related languages) have lost them over the past few centuries in Gǀui. Nonetheless, Gǀui has the largest known inventory of clicks of any Khoe language.

Gǀui has been described with a contrast between velar and uvular clicks. However, all Gǀui clicks are uvular (or pharyngeal); the &#x27;uvular&#x27; part of the latter is part of an airstream contour, a transition from a click to a non-click release: effectively, the click transitions into a non-click consonant. (See Nǁng language for a similar situation in another language.) Nakagawa proposes that the contour and glottalized clicks are not single sounds, but sequences of a click and a uvular or glottal consonant, though Miller (2011) notes that such an analysis creates problems when extended to other languages with clicks.

Altogether there are thirteen such series, or &quot;accompaniments&quot;, and all 52 possible combinations are found. Except for the lack of bilabial clicks, the inventory is nearly identical to that of some speakers of ǂʼAmkoe, which is in intense contact with Gǀui and may have borrowed some of its clicks from Gǀui, and lost others not found in Gǀui.

Miller (2011), in a comparative study with other languages, interprets Nakagawa&#x27;s description as follows. (Nakagawa&#x27;s and are analyzed as and , respectively.)
The voiced contour (&#x27;uvular&#x27;) clicks tend to be prenasalized, .
As in the majority of languages with clicks, the glottalized nasal series are pronounced with a glottal release in initial position, and prenasalized after a vowel. The contrast between glottalized oral and glottalized nasal clicks is unusual, but has also been reported from ǂʼAmkoe and Yeyi since Nakagawa announced its discovery in Gǀui. The Khute dialect of Gǀui also has preglottalized nasal clicks allophonically. They developed from glottalized nasal clicks before pharyngealized vowels, perhaps under ǂʼAmkoe influence:

===Other consonants===

Most words are of the form CV, CVV, CVCV, CVN, where C stands for a consonant, V for a vowel, and N for a nasal consonant /m, n/. In CVCV words, only a limited set of consonants // may occur in medial position (the second syllable). Of these, two // may not occur at the beginning of a word, and due to restrictions with nasal vowels may be argued to be allophonic. The // is pronounced after a lateral click or a pharyngeal vowel. only occurs in mimesis. occurs in a single word, &quot;t&#x27;aa&quot; &#x27;to carve&#x27;, which is not widely known.

The palatals, which are unique among Khoisan languages to Gǁana-Gǀui, derive historically from the alveolars before non-pharyngealized vowels. In Gǁana this shift has only partly occurred.

 and have also been analyzed as and , the ejective homologues of and . However, their pronunciation is and .

===Vowels===
Gǀui has five modal vowels, , three nasal vowels, , and two pharyngeal vowels, . There are diphthongs and , but they are allophones of . Gǀui also has breathy-voice vowels, but they are described as part of the tone system.

Only the five modal vowels occur in monomoraic (CV or V) roots, which except for the noun &quot;χò&quot; &#x27;thing, place, case&#x27; are all grammatical morphemes. These are reduced to three nasal vowels after nasal consonants, including the glottalized nasal clicks.

The modal vowels and the pharyngeal vowels, , occur as the first vowel (V1) of bimoraic roots, CVCV, CVV, and CVN, though the modal vowels are reduced to before a nasal coda, CVN. This corresponds to in Gǁana. Pharyngeal and are also in complementary distribution: in CVV words and in CVCV and CVN words; some speakers use in CVV roots too, so that their pharyngeal vowels are reduced to .

The modal and nasal vowels (but not the pharyngeals) occur as the second vowel (V2) of bimoraic roots, CVCV or CVV, though only modal vowels may follow the medial consonants , and only nasal vowels follow the medial consonants . Either oral or nasal vowels may follow or null (CVV roots). That is, medial may be seen as allophones of .

The initial consonant (C1) may be any but . The medial consonant (C2) may be . N may be .

There are other vowel restrictions. V1 is always in CVCV words when C1 is non-click palatal, for example. (This is because those sounds arose historically from alveolars followed by , which are still found in Naro.) Uvular(ized) consonants cause vowel lowering.

===Tone===
Gǀui may be analyzed as having two abstract phonemic tones, plus breathy voice, which is covered here rather than under vowels.

Monosyllabic morphemes carry one of two tones, high and low. Bimoraic roots carry one of six tones: high-level, high-mid (or &quot;high falling&quot;), mid-low (or &quot;mid&quot;), low-mid dipping/rising, high falling (or &quot;falling&quot;), and low falling (or &quot;low&quot;). Low falling and low-mid are accompanied by a breathy voice phonation, the other four with a clear phonation. The high and low falling tones form a natural class, triggering for example a high tone on the suffix -si, whereas the other four root tones trigger a low tone on -si.

That is, there are two tones on CV and V roots; two tones on bimoraic roots with breathy vowels, one of them falling; and four tones on bimoraic roots with other vowels, one of them falling. Thus there are four phonemic tones on CVCV, CVV, and CVN roots, the number expected if there are two possible tones on each mora, with moraic N carrying tone, though their contours are not simple juxtapositions of high/low + high/low.

<text>Coulsdon South railway station serves Coulsdon in the London Borough of Croydon, and is in Travelcard Zone 6, on the Brighton Main Line. It is measured from . The station is served by Southern and by Thameslink. It is the most southerly mainline station in London.

== History ==

Coulsdon is on a stretch of line between Croydon and Redhill which the UK Parliament insisted should be shared by the London and Brighton Railway (L&amp;BR) route to Brighton, and the South Eastern Railway (SER) route to Dover. As a result, there have been a number of railway stations at Coulsdon.

===Coulsdon South===

This station was opened by the South Eastern Railway (SER) on 1 October 1889. The line is on a steep gradient climbing towards Merstham Tunnel. It is from , and has two platforms each long enough for a 12-coach train. It was originally called Coulsdon and Cane Hill, referring to the nearby psychiatric hospital: a covered way connected the station to the hospital. By the 1960s, the covered way had been removed.

===Ticketing===
The station remains staffed for most of the operational day, with a booking office located on the up (west) side of the station. At the entrance to the ticket office from the station approach road, there are two self-service ticket machines, one of which, most unusually, is wall-mounted.
A PERTIS self-service &#x27;Permit to Travel&#x27; ticket machine was previously provided here but has been removed. Automatic Ticket Barriers were installed at the station in spring 2011

===Other stations in Coulsdon===
*Stoats Nest for Coulsdon and Cane Hill (later Coulsdon North) was opened on 8 November 1899, by the LB&amp;SCR on their Quarry Line which bypassed Redhill. It closed 3 October 1983.
* Smitham (later Coulsdon Town) was opened in 1904 by the SER on their Tattenham Corner Line and is named after another nearby settlement. This station was renamed from Smitham in 2011 as part of Southern Railway&#x27;s new franchise agreement. This change was made as a result of a local consultation carried out by Croydon Council and it intended to better reflect the location of the station near Coulsdon town centre.

===Recent history===
In May 2019, work began to install a new accessible footbridge with lifts and tactile paving. The work was completed in August 2020 having been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

== Services ==

Services at Coulsdon South are operated by Southern and Thameslink using and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 

On Sundays, the service between London and Reigate reduces to hourly. In addition, the Peterborough to Horsham service also reduces to hourly and northbound, runs only as far as London Bridge

==Connections==
London Buses routes 60, 404, 405, 463 and night route N68 serve the station.

==Trivia==
David Bowie&#x27;s schizophrenic half-brother Terry, died by suicide on 16 January 1985 when he walked in front of a train at Coulsdon South railway station.

<doc id="714791" wikidata="Q4726594" url="?curid=714791" title="Aliʻi">
<text>The aliʻi were the traditional nobility of the Hawaiian islands. They were part of a hereditary line of rulers, the &quot;noho aliʻi&quot;.

Cognates of the word &quot;aliʻi&quot; have a similar meaning in other Polynesian languages; in Māori it is pronounced &quot;ariki&quot; and in Tahitian ari&#x27;i.

==Background==
In ancient Hawaiian society, the &quot;aliʻi&quot; were hereditary nobles (a social class or caste). The &quot;aliʻi&quot; consisted of the higher and lesser chiefs of the various levels on the islands. The &quot;noho aliʻi&quot; were the ruling chiefs. The &quot;aliʻi&quot; were believed to be descended from the deities.

There were eleven classes of &quot;aliʻi&quot;, of both men and women. These included the &quot;kahuna&quot; (priestesses and priests, experts, craftsmen, and canoe makers) as part of four professions practiced by the nobility. Each island had its own aliʻi nui, who governed their individual systems. &quot;Aliʻi&quot; continued to play a role in the governance of the Hawaiian islands until 1893, when Queen Liliʻuokalani was overthrown by a coup d&#x27;état backed by the United States government.

&quot;Aliʻi nui&quot; were ruling chiefs (in Hawaiian, &quot;nui&quot; means grand, great, or supreme.). The &quot;nui&quot; title could be passed on by right of birth.

==Social designations of noho aliʻi (ruling line)==
Historians David Malo, Samuel M. Kamakau and Abraham Fornander wrote extensively about the different aliʻi lines and their importance to Hawaiian history. The distinctions between the aliʻi ranks and lines comes from their writings.

*Aliʻi nui were supreme high chiefs of an island and no others were above them (during the Kingdom period this title would come to mean &quot;Governor&quot;). The four largest Hawaiian islands (Hawaiʻi proper, Maui, Kauaʻi, and Oʻahu) were usually ruled each by their own aliʻi nui. Molokaʻi also had a line of island rulers, but was later subjected to the superior power of nearby Maui and Oʻahu during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Mōʻī was a special title for the highest chief of the island of Maui. Later, the title was used for all rulers of the Hawaiian Islands and the Hawaiian monarchs.
*Aliʻi nui kapu were sacred rulers with special taboos.
*Aliʻi Nīʻaupiʻo were a rank of chiefs who were considered the very highest in descent and power. Nīʻaupiʻo chiefs can be from Piʻo or Naha unions.
*Aliʻi Piʻo were a rank of chiefs who were products of full blood sibling unions. Famous &quot;Piʻo&quot; chiefs were the royal twins, Kameʻeiamoku and Kamanawa.
*Aliʻi Naha were a rank of chiefs who were products of either half-blood sibling unions or the unions of uncle and niece or father and daughter. The exact definition is disputed amongst Malo, Kamakau and Fornander. Chiefs of this rank traditionally possessed the &quot;kapu noho&quot; (sitting kapu). Famous &quot;Naha&quot; chiefs include Keōpūolani.
*Aliʻi Wohi were a rank of chiefs who were products of marriage of close relatives other than siblings; one famous Wohi chief was Kamehameha I. These chiefs possessed the &quot;kapu wohi&quot;, exempting them from &quot;kapu moe&quot; (prostration taboo).
*Papa were chiefs born to mother of the nīʻaupiʻo, piʻo, or naha rank with a lower-ranking male chief.
*Lōkea were chiefs born to high-ranked father with a mother who was a relative through younger siblings.
*Lāʻau aliʻi were chiefs born to parents who are children of high chiefs through secondary unions.
*Kaukaualiʻi were lesser chiefs who served the aliʻi nui. It is a relative term and not a fixed level of aliʻi nobility. The expression is elastic in terms of how it is used. In general, it means a relative who is born from a lesser ranking parent. A kaukaualiʻi son&#x27;s own children, if born of a lesser ranking aliʻi mother, would descend to a lower rank. Eventually the line descends, leading to makaʻāinana (commoner). &quot;Kaukaualiʻi&quot; gain rank through marriage with higher-ranking &quot;aliʻi&quot;.
*Aliʻi noanoa were chiefs born to a high chief and a commoner.
One kaukaualiʻi line descended from Moana Kāne, son of Keākealanikāne, became secondary aliʻi to the Kamehameha rulers of the kingdom and were responsible for various &quot;hana lawelawe&quot; (service tasks). Members of this line married into the Kamehamehas, including Charles Kanaʻina and Kekūanaōʻa. Some bore &quot;Kāhili&quot;, royal standards made of feathers, and were attendants of the higher-ranking &quot;aliʻi&quot;. During the monarchy some of these chiefs were elevated to positions within the primary political bodies of the Hawaiian legislature and the king&#x27;s Privy Council. All Hawaiian monarchs after Kamehameha III were the children of Kaukaualiʻi fathers who married higher ranking wives.

<text>The Hawaii State Library is a historic building in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States, that serves as the seat of the Hawaii State Public Library System, the only statewide library system and one of the largest in the United States. The Hawaii State Library building is located in downtown Honolulu, adjacent to Iolani Palace and the Hawaii State Capitol. Originally funded by Andrew Carnegie, the building was designed by architect Henry D. Whitfield. Groundbreaking took place in 1911 and construction was completed in 1913. In 1978, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, as a contributing property within the Hawaii Capital Historic District.

The building holds over 525,000 cataloged books. The entire Hawaii State Public Library System has a collection of over 3 million books. Nearby is the Hawaii State Archives which holds book collections of historical significance to Hawaii. The Edna Allyn Children&#x27;s Room houses murals by artist Juliette May Fraser depicting Hawaiian legends while the garden courtyard features a mosaic of ocean currents by Hiroki Morinoue. Barbara Hepworth&#x27;s cast bronze sculptures, named &quot;Parent I&quot; and &quot;Young Girl&quot;, greet visitors at the lawn in front of the building.
==History==
Before the Hawaii State Library was constructed, library facilities were provided by the Honolulu Library and Reading Room Association, founded in 1879 by the Kingdom of Hawaii. Prior to this, the site was the location of Hāliʻimaile, the residence of Boki and Liliha and later, Victoria Kamāmalu and her father and brothers before they ascended Kamehameha IV and Kamehameha V. Hawaii&#x27;s royalty (King Kalakaua, Queen Kapiolani, Queen Emma, and Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop) gave both financial support and their personal book collections to the association. King Kalakaua also provided tax exemptions and a land grant for a permanent site in downtown Honolulu.

The Hawaii State Library was funded by a grant from Andrew Carnegie. The Library met the government-related requirements for the grant with the cooperation of Walter F. Frear. Edna Allyn was the head librarian when it opened in 1913.

In 1921, the County Library Law established separate libraries on the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii, under minimal supervision by the Library of Hawaii, which restricted its services to Oahu. Even so, the latter quickly outgrew its quarters. In 1927, the Territorial legislature approved funding to expand and renovate the building. Construction was completed in 1930. Architect C.W. Dickey tripled its size by new wings to create an open-air courtyard in the center.

After statehood in 1959, the Hawaii State Legislature created the Hawaii State Public Library System, the only statewide system in the United States, with the Hawaii State Library building as its flagship branch. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the library continued to outgrow its facility. In 1990, it funded a second major renovation and expansion, which was completed in 1992. The renovations addressed air-conditioning, roofing, asbestos removal, plumbing, better access for the handicapped, and landscaping, while the expansion added a large wing to the rear of the building that blended well with the older wings.

== Library development in Hawaii ==
The library system of Hawaii State Library, which was established in June 1965, called for a new concept of organization that had to be created by the state librarian. This system would provide complete service to all aspects of society. Ideas were sourced from other established libraries and organizations, then integrated to create best practices for the library system. Although the Library System is an independent State agency, the state librarian is appointed by the Board of Education, and reports directly to the Superintendent of Education. Other government agencies that the state librarian reports to are the seven appointed School Advisory Councils, the four Library Advisory Commissions, and others that are engaged in education. The state librarian is responsible for the operation, planning, programming, and budgeting of all public libraries within the State; however, there are no local funds in Hawaii, and as such, the governor and legislature approve the funding and budget of the State Library.

<text>Stuttgart Region (Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is an urban agglomeration at the heart of the Stuttgart Metropolitan Region. It consists of the city of Stuttgart and the surrounding districts of Ludwigsburg, Esslingen, Böblingen, Rems-Murr and Göppingen (each 10–20 km from Stuttgart city center). About 2.7 million inhabitants live in that area (3,700 km2). In fact, with 708 people per square kilometre, the Stuttgart Region () is one of the most densely populated areas in Germany. Stuttgart Region is governed by a directly elected parliament.

Situated at the heart of Baden-Württemberg, the &quot;Stuttgart Region&quot; is the hub of economic, scientific, and political life in Southwest Germany. The area currently has Germany&#x27;s highest density of scientific, academic and research organisations, and tops the national league for patent applications.

== Geography ==
From northwest to southeast the region is 90 kilometers long and from southwest to northeast 80 kilometers. The size of the area is 3.654 km2. According to calculations made by the land surveying office, the geographical center is located in the south of the district Rems-Murr a few hundred meters east from the village Weinstadt-Strümpfelbach in a vineyard. An erratic placed after the vine field reform - the so-called &quot;Vogelstein&quot; - lays by accident almost exactly in that center.

The Neckar flows through the region for about 90 kilometers, of which about 70 kilometers are navigable waterway. The longest tributary in the region is the Fils (50 km), followed by Murr (45 km), the Rems (35 km) and the Enz (30 km).

Topographically the Region lays between 170 m above sea level (Neckar near Kirchheim am Neckar) and 835 m above sea level (swabian albs plateau near Hohenstadt).

== Demographics ==
About 2.7 million people live in the Stuttgart Region, which corresponds to a quarter of the entire population of Baden-Württemberg at about on tenth of its size. 749 people/km2 is the regions average population density.

The numbers of inhabitants are census results (¹) or official updates of the statistical state office of Baden-Württemberg (only primary residence).

== Verband Region Stuttgart ==
The Verband Region Stuttgart (VRS) a public body, is as one of 12 regional associations in Baden-Württemberg political and administrative instance of the Stuttgart Region. Its predecessor is the &quot;Regionalverband Mittlerer Neckar&quot; founded in 1973 which was renamed to &quot;Regionalverband Stuttgart&quot; in 1992. By law it was transferred into the &quot;Verband Region Stuttgart&quot; on February, 7th 1994. Thereby the new association besides the regional planning, received additional tasks and has as the only regional association in Baden-Württemberg a directly elected parliament. The &quot;regional assembly of the Verband Region Stuttgart&quot; is elected every five years.

Further association bodies besides the regional assembly are the honorary chairman elected by the assembly out of its members for 5 years and the regional director elected for 8 years who is temporary full-time public official. The regional director represents the association and leads the Administration. His office is located in the associations office in Stuttgart. The association additionally has an office in Brussels.

The Budget of the VRS for 2016 was 389 million Euro (2015: 323 million Euro).

=== Tasks ===
Important compulsory tasks of the VRS are amongst others:

* regional spatial planning (regional planning)
* regional transportation planning and public transport
* regional economic promotion

==== Spatial Planning ====
The VRS is the representative for the regional spatial planning (regional planning). Most important tool herefore is the regional plan according to § 9 ROG. This plan names the following central places.

==== Transport ====
The VRS is responsible for the regional transport planning and the regional significant local public transport. In the regional transport plan it makes forecasts of the traffic development for longer periods of time and names and evaluates urgent measures to cope with traffic. The VRS is sponsor of the S-Bahn Stuttgart and stakeholder of the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart (VVS). Moreover, he co-finances Stuttgart 21.

Out of the 323 million Euro in the budget of 2015, 300.4 million Euro went to the transport budget. Of those, 80.5 Million Euro was for the operation of the S-Bahn, the Schuster and the small Teckbahn.

According to a financing agreement the VRS receives for the S-Bahn Stuttgart 9,1 % of the states regionalization budget from 2018 until 2031, 88 million Euro in 2018.

==== Economic promotion ====
In order to exercise as required by law, the regionally important task of economic promotion, the VRS founded together with other Stakeholders the die &quot;Wirtschaftsförderung Region Stuttgart GmbH (in 1995).&quot; Besides the recruitment and the guidance of companies which want to locate in the Stuttgart Region (Exogenic economic promotion) the about 50 employees of WRS consult and assist within the scope of site development already locally based companies (endogenous economic promotion).

Besides the classical economic promotion in the narrower sense (e.g. through the marketing of industry sites, guidance of investors at their search for a location as well as location marketing) one focus is on the economic promotion activities of the Stuttgart Region and the Support of certain business clusters. Amongst others.:

* Automotive industry and engineering
* Mechanical Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering
* Energy and Environmental Engineering
* Information Technology (especially in the field of Open-Source-Software)
* Health based economy
* Aerospace Engineering
* Cultural industry

In order to support these Clusters, the WRS initiates, coordinates and mentors the WRS branch networks (e.g. the &quot;Clusterinitiative Automotive CARS&quot;, the &quot;MedienInitiative Region Stuttg&quot;art or the &quot;Initiative Open Source Region Stuttgart&quot;), organises Symposiums (as for example the annual fuel cell congress f-cell) and gathers and publishes a variety of branch information.

In order to promote the employer attractiveness of the regions small and medium-sized employers to the pupils, students and graduates, the Wirtschaftsförderung Region Stuttgart GmbH hosts an online Stuttgart Region employer directory. There organizations have the possibility to present themselves and their current offers for junior employees.

In order to improve the knowledge transfer and contacts between industry and science, 15 competence and Innovation Centers have been established in the Region within which organisations, universities and research facilities work together interdisciplinary on industries related projects. Examples for such competence and Innovation Centers are the Virtual Dimension Center (VDC, competence Center for virtual reality in Fellbach), the Kompetenznetzwerk Mechatronik in Göppingen, the Packaging Excellence Center (PEC, competence Center for packaging and automation technology) in Waiblingen or the Software center Böblingen/Sindelfingen.

Further activities aim at the supply of skilled employees (for example through advancing the compatibility of family and careers and model projects on professional development). As well as the support of company foundations (for example through the partner network &quot;Partnernetz für Unternehmensgründungen aus Stuttgarter Hochschulen (PUSH)&quot; or the agency of founders and private Investors; see also Business Angels). In order to sponsor the music and film industry the Region has established two separate institutions: The &quot;Film Commission Region Stuttgart&quot; and the &quot;Popbüro Region Stuttgart&quot;.

== Infrastructure ==
The Stuttgart Region is accessed through a dense roadenetwork of controlled access highways (Autobahn), federal Highway (Bundesstraßen), district roads (Kreisstrassen). The Bundesstraßen, enhanced to four to six lanes run in a star pattern towards the states capital. There are only few efficient tangential Connections. The two Autobahns A 8 and A 81 meet in the Region at the Leonberg triangle, one of the most used Autobahn junctions in Germany. Stuttgarter Hauptbahnhof, the main railway station is hub for the long-distance, regional and S-Bahn-Verkehr. Within a radius of 100 km you thereby can reach about 12 million people. Stuttgart Airport has become a European hub for almost 60 airlines. 10 Million passengers use it annually and 65,000 tons of air freight is shipped here. Flights are offered to over 120 destinations in more than 40 countries. Through the Stuttgarter Harbour the Region is connected to the inner German and western European waterway network. Cargo ships with a tonnage of up to 2,800 t are loaded and unloaded here daily. In order to accommodate the large number of commuters in the Region and relieve the roads, the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart (VVS) offers, counting only the S-Bahn already a network of 215 km length and Services 83 stops.

The leisure traffic accumulates the majority of the distances taken by the regions 2.7 Million inhabitants. About 800,000 People, roundabout three quarters of the socially insured employees, do not work where they live.

== Economic significance ==

Stuttgart Region is one of Europe&#x27;s economic centres. This is due not only to the influence of international companies, such as Daimler, Porsche, Robert Bosch, Celesio, Hewlett-Packard and IBM (all of whom have their world or German headquarters here), but also to the influence of medium-sized enterprises such as Behr, Kärcher, Märklin, Stihl, Festo, and Trumpf. In total, approximately 150,000 companies are located in the Stuttgart Region. 24 per cent of employees in the Stuttgart Region work in the high-tech sector – a European record.

The &quot;Verband Region Stuttgart&quot; as a political entity is responsible for regional transportation planning and for the basic network of public transport in Stuttgart Region.

== Research and development ==
Out of the total Investments in R&amp;D of German companies, more than 10% is invested by companies from the Stuttgart Region, which is one of the reasons for its leading high patent application amount. Two institutes of the Max Planck Society, six of the Fraunhofer Society, for industrial development institutes where several companies work together, one large research institution, 88 transfer centers of the Steinbeis foundation for economic Promotion and many research facilities at Universities and Universities of Applied sciences are located in the region..

== Administrative District of Stuttgart ==

Stuttgart Region shouldn&#x27;t be confused with the Administrative District of Stuttgart.

The German state of Baden-Württemberg is sub-divided into four districts:

*Administrative District of Stuttgart
*Administrative District of Tübingen
*Administrative District of Karlsruhe
*Administrative District of Freiburg

Stuttgart Region is part of the &quot;Administrative District of Stuttgart&quot; (Regierungsbezirk Stuttgart, 4 million inhabitants, 11,000 km2).

== Stuttgart Metropolitan Area ==

<doc id="714824" wikidata="Q422669" url="?curid=714824" title="Nitrofurantoin">
<text>Nitrofurantoin, sold under the brand name Macrobid among others, is an antibacterial medication of the nitrofuran class used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), although it is not as effective for kidney infections. It is taken by mouth.

Common side effects include nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and headaches. Rarely numbness, lung problems, or liver problems may occur. While it appears to be generally safe during pregnancy its use is not recommended near time of delivery. While it usually works by slowing bacterial growth, it may result in bacterial death at the high concentrations found in urine, provided forced fluid dilution of urine is avoided.

Nitrofurantoin was first sold in 1953. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 158th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Urinary tract infections===
Uses of nitrofurantoin include the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) and prophylaxis against UTIs in people prone to recurrent UTIs. It is a first-line therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis. It is not recommended for empiric treatment of hospital-acquired UTIs.

Increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance to other commonly used agents, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones, has led to increased interest in using nitrofurantoin in the contemporary treatment of UTIs. The efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating UTIs combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes it one of the first-line agents for treating uncomplicated UTIs as recommended by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

In meta-analyses of clinical trials, nitrofurantoin has shown clinical UTI cure rates of 79 to 92% and bacterial eradication rates of 80 to 92%. Treatment with nitrofurantoin for 7days was not more effective than treatment for 5days, whereas treatment for 5days was superior to treatment for 3days (which showed clinical cure rates of 61–70%). The effectiveness of nitrofurantoin for 5days is equivalent to that with single-dose fosfomycin.

As a prophylactic against UTIs, nitrofurantoin was similarly effective to other antibiotics, with a UTI risk ratio of 0.38. Taken daily long-term as a prophylactic, there were no differences in effectiveness between different doses of nitrofurantoin (50mg/day, 75mg/day, 100mg/day, or 50mg twice daily). Although similarly effective as other antibiotics, prophylactic nitrofurantoin showed an increased risk of adverse effects compared to other antibiotics (risk ratios = 2.17 to 2.24). The adverse effects of nitrofurantoin were mostly gastrointestinal in nature.

===Other bacterial infections===
Nitrofurantoin is not recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis (kidney infection), and intra-abdominal abscess, because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels.

Nitrofurantoin appears likely to minimally penetrate the prostate gland. As such, nitrofurantoin is not recommended for eradication of chronic bacterial prostatitis. In any case, in men with antibiotic-refractory or relapsing chronic bacterial prostatitis, prophylactic nitrofurantoin may be useful in preventing UTIs and managing symptoms. However, supporting data are lacking as of 2020.

===Antibacterial activity===
Nitrofurantoin has been shown to have good activity against:

* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
* &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species
* &quot;Enterococcus&quot; species
* &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species (mixed)
* &quot;Citrobacter&quot; species
* Coagulase negative staphylococci
* &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; species
* &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;

It is used in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms.

Many or all strains of the following genera are resistant to nitrofurantoin:

* &quot;Enterobacter&quot; species (mixed)
* &quot;Proteus&quot; species
* &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species
* &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species
* &quot;Morganella&quot; species
* &quot;Serratia&quot; species
* &quot;Providencia&quot; species

===Special populations===
====Pregnancy====
Nitrofurantoin is pregnancy category A in Australia. It is one of the few drugs commonly used in pregnancy to treat UTIs. There is a potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn when used near time of delivery. Newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice.

Evidence of safety in early pregnancy is mixed as of 2017. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that while they can be used in the first trimester other options may be preferred. They remain a first line treatment in the second trimester. A 2015 meta analysis found no increased risk from first trimester use in cohort studies that was a slight increase of malformations in case control studies.

==Contraindications==
Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function (CrCl &lt; ) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. However, a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of CrCl &lt; would be more appropriate. Many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. Thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 AGS Beers Criteria.

Nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month, as they have immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells (glutathione instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia.

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects of nitrofurantoin are nausea, headache, and flatulence. Less common adverse events (occurring in less than 1% of those taking the drug) include:

* Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, emesis
* Neurologic: dizziness, drowsiness, amblyopia
* Respiratory: acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction
* Allergic: pruritus, urticaria
* Dermatologic: hair loss
* Miscellaneous: fever, chills, malaise

Taken daily long-term as a prophylactic, side effects of nitrofurantoin occur at rates of 0 to 29%. They are generally mild, reversible, and are predominantly gastrointestinal.

===Lung toxicity===
The pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. The acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. Acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug. These reactions usually develop 3–8 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin, but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. Symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, headache, back pain, and epigastric pain. Chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema.

Chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early.

===Liver toxicity===
Liver reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely.

===Neuropathy===
Neuropathy is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin. Patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stocking-glove pattern, which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug.

===Gut microflora===
Nitrofurantoin has been found to modify the gut microbiota composition. Effects in three clinical studies have included increased abundance of Actinobacteria, &quot;Bifidobacterium&quot; species, and &quot;Clostridium&quot; species, decreased abundance of &quot;Faecalibacterium&quot; species, and no changes. Similarly to other antibiotics, nitrofurantoin has been associated with increased risk of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection and associated diarrhea. However, this was based on a single study in which only two cases occurred. Other sources state that nitrofurantoin has a low risk of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection.

==Interactions==
Nitrofurantoin has historically been reported to be a disulfiram-like drug and to produce alcohol intolerance-type reactions when combined with alcohol. However, subsequent clinical studies failed to replicate these findings and the earlier results have been deemed erroneous.

==Pharmacology==
Organisms are said to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin if their minimum inhibitory concentration is 32 /mL or less. The peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100mg is less than 1μg/mL and may be undetectable. Its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40% tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200μg/mL or more. In studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion. There is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. However the activity of nitrofurantoin is also pH dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased pH above 6. Nitrofurantoin cannot be used to treat infections other than simple cystitis.

At the concentrations achieved in urine (&gt;100μg/mL), nitrofurantoin is a bactericide. It is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms at concentrations less than 32μg/mL.

Nitrofurantoin and the quinolone antibiotics are mutually antagonistic &quot;in vitro&quot;. It is not known whether this is of clinical significance.

Resistance to nitrofurantoin may be chromosomal or plasmid-mediated and involves inhibition of nitrofuran reductase. Acquired resistance in &quot;E. coli&quot; continues to be rare.

Nitrofurantoin and its metabolites are excreted mainly by the kidneys. In renal impairment, the concentration achieved in urine may be subtherapeutic.

===Mechanism of action===
Nitrofurantoin is concentrated in the urine, leading to higher and more effective levels in the urinary tract than in other tissues or compartments. With a oral dose, plasma levels are typically less than while in the urine it reaches .

The drug works by damaging bacterial DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is made possible by the rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad mechanism of action for nitrofurantoin is likely responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as it affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.

==History==
Nitrofurantoin has been available for the treatment of lower UTIs since 1953.

==Society and culture==
===Brand names===
Nitrofurantoin is marketed under many names in countries worldwide.

==Animal feed==
Residues from the breakdown of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, have been found in chicken in Vietnam, China, Brazil, and Thailand. The European Union prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in ANNEX IV (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the Council Regulation 2377/90. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States has prohibited furaltadone since February 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in January 1992. The topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. Australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. Japan did not allocate MRLs for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a &quot;zero tolerance or no residue standard&quot;. In Thailand, the Ministry of Health issued in 2001 Proclamation No. 231 MRL of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate MRL for nitrofurans. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. Several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.

<doc id="714828" wikidata="Q6792754" url="?curid=714828" title="Maureen Reagan">
<text>Maureen Elizabeth Reagan (January 4, 1941 – August 8, 2001) was an American political activist and the first child of U.S. president Ronald Reagan and his first wife, actress Jane Wyman. Her younger brother is Michael Reagan and her half-siblings are Patti Davis and Ron Reagan, from her father&#x27;s second marriage (to Nancy Reagan).

==Early life==
Reagan was born January 4, 1941, in Los Angeles, where she was raised. She graduated from Marymount Secondary School, Tarrytown, New York, in 1958 and briefly attended Marymount University in Virginia. She worked for Walker &amp; Dunlop and entered the Miss Washington competition in 1959.

Her parents also had another daughter, Christine, who died shortly after birth.

===Acting career===
Reagan pursued a career in acting in her youth, appearing in films such as &quot;Kissin&#x27; Cousins&quot; (1964) in which she featured alongside Elvis Presley. She played Mrs. Moss on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; S2 E6 &quot;Ship of Ghouls&quot; opposite Vincent Price as The Amazing Alonzo. The episode aired on 10/27/1978.

==Political activities==
Reagan was the first son or daughter of a U.S. president to be elected co-chair of the Republican National Committee. However, both of her attempts at election to political office ended in defeat. She ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from California in 1982 (which was eventually won by Pete Wilson) and in 1992 for California&#x27;s 36th congressional district.

Although they maintained a united front, Maureen Reagan differed from her father on several key issues. Although reared Roman Catholic following her mother&#x27;s conversion, she was pro-choice on abortion. She also held the belief that Oliver North should have been court-martialed.

After her father announced his diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1994, Maureen Reagan became a member of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association board of directors and served as the group&#x27;s spokeswoman. While hospitalized for melanoma cancer towards the end of her life, Maureen was only floors away from her father who had suffered a severe fall.

==Personal life==

In 1960, Maureen&#x27;s by-then divorced parents became concerned about her. Ronald Reagan used his connections at the FBI − established during his work as an anti-communist informant − to request the agency to investigate her romantic life. The agency did so on condition that the FBI not be cited as a source, and reported that she was living with an older, married man who was a police officer.

Maureen Reagan was married three times:
*John Filippone, a policeman; they were married in 1961 and divorced the following year.
*David G. Sills, a lawyer and Marine Corps officer; they married on February 28, 1964; the couple divorced in 1967. He would later go on to become Mayor of Irvine, California and Presiding Justice of the California Court of Appeal for the 4th District.
*Dennis C. Revell, CEO of Revell Communications (a national public relations/public affairs firm), whom she married on April 25, 1981. She and Revell adopted one daughter, Margaret &quot;Rita&quot; Mirembe Revell, who was born in Uganda. The Revells became Rita&#x27;s guardians in 1994. They adopted her in 2001. Rita was the beneficiary of a private bill to facilitate her adoption as Maureen and Dennis Revell were unable to complete the necessary paperwork and other requirements by the Ugandan government, including a personal visitation to that country, due, in large part, to Maureen Reagan Revell&#x27;s terminal cancer.

==Death==
Reagan died in Granite Bay, California, on August 8, 2001, aged 60, from melanoma. She is interred at Calvary Catholic Cemetery and Mausoleum in Sacramento, California.

Reagan volunteered with actor David Hyde Pierce, of TV&#x27;s &quot;Frasier&quot;, at the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association. At her funeral on August 19, 2001, Pierce spoke to the mourners at the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in Sacramento, and recalled his friend&#x27;s attitude to her illness. &quot;When she was given lemons, she did not make lemonade. She took the lemons, threw them back and said, &#x27;Oh, no you don&#x27;t.&#x27;&quot;

<text>The Megola was a German motorcycle produced between 1921 and 1925 in Munich. Like Bimota, the name is a portmanteau derived from the names of its designers Meixner, Gockerell, and Landgraf.

==Design==
The Megola had a unique design, laid down in 1920 by Fritz Cockerell, whose real name was Friedrich Gockerell. He used a rotary engine mounted within the front wheel. It has a five-cylinder flathead engine. Each cylinder has a bore and stroke of and displaces , making the total displacement . The cylinders rotate around the front axle at six times the wheel speed; thus while the cylinders are at maximum of 3,600 rpm the front wheel turns at 600 rpm, or roughly (given the wheel diameter). A hand-controlled butterfly valve in the hollow crankshaft regulates the throttle. Power output was , applied directly to the wheel. This creates a very low centre of gravity and gives excellent handling.

The first prototype was the &quot;PAX&quot;, built in 1918 with a three-cylinder engine within the rear wheel. This was followed in 1920 by a five-cylinder prototype, but still with the engine in the rear wheel. For the production model, the engine was relocated in the front wheel.

Unusual features on the production models included two fuel tanks. The main tank is hidden inside the extensive bodywork, and the fuel from it is hand-pumped to a smaller tank above the engine. The rear wheel has two independent brakes. Megolas came well-equipped, with a fuel gauge, tachometer and ammeter as standard equipment. Two models were offered: sporting and touring. The touring model has a sprung rear wheel and soft saddle. The sport lacks rear suspension but has a more powerful engine. The top speed is . Motorcycle racer Toni Bauhofer achieved on a sports-model on the AVUS racing circuit in Berlin. In 1924 he won the over-500cc-class on a Megola at the German Motorcycle Road Championship.
The engine was very flexible, lacking both a clutch and a transmission. To start the engine, the rider had to either spin the front wheel while the cycle was on its stand, or push-start the cycle. The cylinders could be disassembled without having to remove all the wheel spokes to reach them. The lack of a clutch meant the engine had to be stopped when the cycle was stationary. As an alternative, the owner&#x27;s manual suggested the rider make small orbits in the road if at any point they had to halt.

The tires were tubed with the front inner-tube being a circular sausage-shape rather than a complete doughnut-like torus shape, so that it could be changed without removing the wheel and engine. At the time, this type of tube was produced commercially so it was likely not created specially for the Megola. The box-section frame contained the main fuel tank which fed by gravity a smaller tank mounted on the axle. The front suspension consisted of semi-elliptical springs.

==Legacy==
During less than five years of production, about 2,000 machines were built and sold. About 15 survive. One was displayed at the Guggenheim Museum &#x27;Art of the Motorcycle&#x27; exhibition in New York City. An example of a sport version of the Megola is part of the automotive collection of Jay Leno. About eight replica Megolas have been built between the 1980s and the present day. One replica, fitted with an original engine, was sold by Bonhams auction house in London in 2016 for £82,140.

==Killinger and Freund==
In 1935 a group of engineers tried to make an improved version, the Killinger and Freund Motorcycle. World War II ended their plans.

<text>Ahoghill ( or ; ) is a large village and civil parish in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, four miles from Ballymena. It is located in the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council area. It had a population of 3,417 people at the 2011 census.

In early documents, Ahoghill is referred to as &quot;Magherahoghill&quot; meaning &quot;the plain of the yew forest.&quot;

== Demography ==
Ahoghill had a population of 3,417 people (1,327 households) at the 2011 census, an increase of 11.8% on the 2001 census population of 3,055.

On census day in 2011:
*22.2% were aged under 16 and 12.6% were aged 65 and over
*48.8% of the population were male and 51.2% were female
*3.8% were from a Catholic background and 90.8% were from a Protestant or other Christian background
*3.5% of people aged 16–74 were unemployed

==History==
===Religious revival===
The 1859 Revival which swept through Ulster has strong connections with Ahoghill. Thousands of ordinary folk had their lives changed at this time. Especially notable is the reports of men and women weeping in the streets of Ahoghill. On Monday 14 March 1859 a thanksgiving service took place in the new First Ahoghill Presbyterian Meetinghouse at which some of the converts from Connor spoke. It was estimated that 3,000 people attended and the commotion was such that the minister ordered the building to be emptied out of fear of the crowded gallery giving way. The crowd spent upwards of three hours in the rain continuing in prayer and praise. The gallery of First Ahoghill still bears the effects of this event; it is visibly sunken to one side.

Today Ahoghill has three Presbyterian churches, First Ahoghill on Straid Road, Brookside on Brook Street and Trinity on Church Street. There is also St Colmanell&#x27;s Church of Ireland on Church Street, a Gospel Hall on Glenhugh Road and a Roman Catholic Chapel on Ballynafie road.

===The Troubles===

On 19 April 1977 William Strathearn (39), a Catholic shop owner was shot and killed by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) while at his home in Ahoghill. The murder was carried out by Billy McCaughey who was a UVF member despite also being a former police officer.

The village has seen frequent sectarian attacks, particularly in 2005 when several Catholic families left after attacks on their homes, and is considered a staunchly loyalist area.
