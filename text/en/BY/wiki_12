<text>The Austria national football team () represents Austria in men&#x27;s international football competitions, and is controlled by the Austrian Football Association. 

The Austrian Football Association (ÖFB) was founded on 18 March 1904, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the 1930s, under coach Hugo Meisl, Austria&#x27;s national team, known as the &quot;Wunderteam&quot; (literally &quot;Wonder Team&quot;), became a dominant force in European football. Notable achievements included a fourth-place finish in the 1934 FIFA World Cup and runners-up at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The Anschluss in 1938, which annexed Austria into Nazi Germany, led to the dissolution of the ÖFB and the obligitory integration of Austrian players into the German national team for the 1938 World Cup.

After World War II, Austria reestablished its national team and achieved significant success in the 1954 World Cup, finishing third. The team continued to be competitive throughout the 1950s and 1960s, including a notable victory over England at Wembley Stadium in 1965. However, the following decades saw fluctuating fortunes, with the team failing to qualify for FIFA World Cups in the 1960s and narrowly missing out on the 1974 World Cup in a playoff against Sweden. The 1970s and 1980s marked a revival, with Austria reaching the second round in the 1978 and 1982 World Cups, highlighted by a famous victory over West Germany in 1978.

The 1990s and 2000s brought challenges and disappointments, such as a shocking defeat to the Faroe Islands in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying, and a group-stage exit in the 1998 World Cup, their seventh and to date, last World Cup appearance. Austria automatically qualified for UEFA Euro 2008 as co-hosts with Switzerland, the first time they played in the UEFA European Championship though they were eliminated in the group stage. The country entered a resurgence in 2016, beginning with a successful qualification campaign for the Euros that year. Austria has experienced a revival in form, successfully qualifying for Euro 2020 and 2024, the latter with current head coach Ralf Rangnick.

==History==

===Pre-World War II===
The Austrian Football Association (&quot;ÖFB&quot;) was founded on 18 March 1904 in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Max Scheuer, a Jewish defender who played for the Austria national football team in 1923, was subsequently killed during the Holocaust in Auschwitz concentration camp. The team enjoyed success in the 1930s under coach Hugo Meisl, becoming a dominant side in Europe and earning the nickname &quot;Wunderteam&quot;. The team&#x27;s star was Matthias Sindelar. On 16 May 1931, they were the first continental European side to defeat Scotland. In the 1934 FIFA World Cup, Austria finished fourth after losing 0–1 to Italy in the semi-finals and 2–3 to Germany in the third place play-off. 
They were runners-up in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, again losing to Italy 1–2, despite having been beaten in the quarter-finals by Peru, following the Peruvians&#x27; withdrawal. However, according to an investigation, the surprise victory by Peru was deliberately annulled by Adolf Hitler to favour the Austrians.

The team then qualified for the 1938 World Cup finals, but Austria was annexed to Germany in the &quot;Anschluss&quot; on 12 March of that year. On 28 March, FIFA was notified that the ÖFB had been abolished, resulting in the nation&#x27;s withdrawal from the World Cup. Instead, the German team would represent the former Austrian territory. Theoretically, a united team could have been an even stronger force than each of the separate ones, but German coach Sepp Herberger had little time and very few matches to prepare and merge the very different styles of play and attitude. The former Austrian professionals outplayed the rather athletic yet amateur players of the &quot;Old Empire&quot; in a &quot;reunification&quot; derby that was supposed to finish as a draw, yet in the waning minutes, the Austrians scored twice, with Matthias Sindelar also demonstratively missing the German goal, and subsequently declining to be capped for Germany. 

In a later rematch, the Germans took revenge, winning 9–1. In early April, Herberger inquired whether two separate teams could enter anyway, but &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; Hans von Tschammer und Osten made clear that he expected to see a 5:6 or 6:5 ratio of players from the two hitherto teams. As a result, five players from Austria Wien, Rapid Wien and Vienna Wien were part of the team that only managed a 1–1 draw in Round 1 against Switzerland, which required a rematch. With Rapid Wien&#x27;s forward Hans Pesser having been sent off, and not satisfied with two others, Herberger had to alter the line-up on six positions to fulfill the 6:5 quota again. The all-German team led the Swiss 2–0 after 15 minutes, but eventually lost 2–4 in Paris in front of a rather anti-German French and Swiss crowd, as few German supporters were able to travel to France due to German restrictions on foreign currency exchange.

===After World War II===

After World War II, Austria&#x27;s 1938 annexation to Germany was annulled and Austria, as before, competed internationally. Austria&#x27;s best result came in 1954 with a team starring midfielder Ernst Ocwirk. They lost in the semi-finals 1–6 to eventual champions Germany in battle in scorching heat (no substitutions were allowed at the time), but finished third after beating defending champions Uruguay 3–1. Over the years, a strong yet mainly lopsided rivalry with Germany developed.

At the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the Austrian suffered defeats to eventual champions Brazil, the emerging Soviet Union and a draw against England (who were rebuilding after the loss of several of their key players due to the Munich air disaster), preventing the team from reaching the next round. 

Due to budgetary problems and the increased cost to travel to South America rather than some European location, Austria took the unprecedented decision, though having qualified, not to participate in the 1962 World Cup in Chile on the one had, or attempt (public) fundraising campaigns on the other zand.. 

On 20 October 1965, Austria became the third European team to defeat England at home. Two goals in a 3–2 victory were scored by Toni Fritsch, who was then nicknamed &quot;Wembley Toni&quot;. However, in the same year, Austria failed to qualify for the World Cup for the 1966 edition, ending third against Hungary and East Germany; they only earned a draw. In the summer of 1968, Leopold Šťastný, the Slovak coach of Wacker Innsbruck, took over the national team. Despite failing to qualify for the 1970 World Cup, the new coach emphasized developing new players rather than relying on the old guard. Austria came very close to qualifying for the 1974 World Cup in Germany. The qualifying round was tied for first place between Austria and Sweden, despite tiebreakers based on points and goal difference, therefore a playoff was needed for qualifying, held in Gelsenkirchen. In order to have enough time to prepare, the championship round was suspended and the stadium in Gelsenkirchen was prepared five days before the playoff. On snow-covered ground, Austria lost 1–2.

===1970s and 1980s===
Anchored by Herbert Prohaska and striker Hans Krankl, and backed up by Bruno Pezzey, Austria reached the World Cup in 1978 and 1982 and both times reached the second round, held in team group matches that replaced the knockout quarter-finals. This Austria team, coached by Helmut Senekowitsch, is widely regarded as the best post-World War II Austrian football team of all-time.

In the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, the Austrians lost their first two matches but defeated defending champions West Germany 3–2 with goals from Hans Krankl, and an own goal. The celebrating report of the radio commentator Edi Finger (&quot;I werd narrisch!&quot;) became famous in Austria, where it is considered the &quot;Miracle of Cordoba&quot;, while the West Germans regard the game and the Austrian behaviour as a disgrace.

During the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Austria and West Germany met again, in the last match of the group stage. Because the other two teams in the group had played their last match the previous day, both teams knew that a West German win by one goal would see both through, while all other results would eliminate one team or the other. After ten minutes of furious attack, Horst Hrubesch scored for West Germany and the two teams mainly kicked the ball around for 80 minutes with few attempts to attack. The match became known as the &quot;non-aggression pact of Gijón&quot;. Algeria had also won two matches, including a shocking surprise over West Germany in the opener, but among the three teams that had won two matches, was eliminated based on goal difference, having conceded two late goals in their 3–2 win over Chile. This match caused outrage between supporters of multiple national teams; as a result, all future tournaments would see the last group matches played simultaneously. Austria and Northern Ireland were eliminated by losing to France in the second round group stage of three teams.

===1990s===
Led by striker Toni Polster, Austria qualified for the 1990 World Cup but were eliminated in the first round, despite defeating the United States 2–1. Much worse was the stunning 1–0 loss against the Faroe Islands, a team made of amateurs, in the qualifying campaign for the 1992 European Championship, considered the worst embarrassment in any Austrian team sport ever, and one of the biggest upsets in footballing history. The game was played in Landskrona, Sweden, as there were no grass fields on the Faroe Islands. It was a sign for things to come, as Austria suffered another couple of years of botched qualifying campaigns, despite playing some entertaining football in the closing stages of UEFA Euro 1996 qualification.

In the 1998 World Cup, Austria were drawn in Group B alongside Italy, Cameroon and Chile. Their appearance was brief, and they achieved the feat of only scoring in stoppage time in each of their matches. Against Cameroon, Pierre Njanka&#x27;s goal was cancelled out by Toni Polster&#x27;s late strike. In their second match, it was Ivica Vastić who curled a last minute equalizer, cancelling out Marcelo Salas&#x27; disputed opener. In their last match, Italy scored twice after half-time: a header from Christian Vieri and a tap-in from Roberto Baggio. Despite Andi Herzog&#x27;s stoppage time penalty, Austria finished third in the group, behind the Italians and Chileans.

===21st century===
====2000: Decline====

After 1998, Austria began to decline. They failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2000, and suffered embarrassment (similar to the Faroe Islands loss) when they lost 9–0 to Spain and 5–0 to Israel in 1999. In 2006, Josef Hickersberger became coach of the Austria national team, which included some respectable results such as a 1–0 victory against Switzerland in 2006.

Austria qualified automatically for Euro 2008 as co-hosts. Their first major tournament in a decade, most commentators regarded them as outsiders for Germany, Croatia and Poland in the group stage. Many of their home supporters were in agreement and 10,000 Austrians signed a petition demanding Austria withdraw from the tournament to spare the nation&#x27;s embarrassment. However, Austria managed a 1–1 draw with Poland and lost 1–0 to both Croatia and Germany.

Shortly after Austria&#x27;s first-round exit from the tournaments, Hickersberger resigned as the national team coach. Karel Brückner, who had resigned as head coach of the Czech Republic after that country&#x27;s first round exit from Euro 2008, was soon named as his replacement. After only eight months, Brückner was released in March 2009 and the position was subsequently taken by Didi Constantini.

====2010s: Revival and setbacks====

In the qualifying campaign for Euro 2012, the Austrians played against Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Turkey and Germany.

A number of players from the 2007 U-20 team that finished fourth in the World Cup that year ended up developing and becoming full starters for the senior squad, including Sebastian Prödl, Markus Suttner, Martin Harnik, Veli Kavlak, Erwin Hoffer, Zlatko Junuzović and Rubin Okotie.

The team failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but finished third with a 5–2–3 record with 17 points and a +10 goal difference in their qualifying group. Notable results include home victories over the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, as well as a narrow home defeat to Germany and a 2–2 draw in Ireland away.
The Euro 2016 qualifying campaign was a success; Austria drew with the Swedes 1–1, before beating them 4–1 in Sweden. Austria also beat Russia twice both home and away, 1–0. Austria also recorded a pair of victories over Moldova (2–1 in Chișinău) and Montenegro (1–0 in Vienna). Rubin Okotie scored the deciding goal in the closing 20 minutes of the match after a previous Austrian goal a minute before was controversially disallowed. A week later, the team played a friendly away game against Brazil, losing 2–1. Austria finished its Euro 2016 qualifying campaign by topping the group undefeated.

Despite this successful performance in qualification, the tournament itself turned out to be a nightmare for the Austrians. Placed in group F with Hungary, Portugal and Iceland, Austria opened their campaign with a 0–2 loss to neighbour Hungary, in which defender Aleksandar Dragović was sent off. This was followed up by an 0–0 draw to Portugal, in which Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty. Nonetheless, Austria ended up losing 1–2 to debutant Iceland and were eliminated with just a point.

Austria would later participate in Group D of 2018 World Cup qualification along with Wales, Serbia, Ireland, Georgia and Moldova, ending up fourth, thus failing to qualify for the World Cup.

====2020s: European Championship knockout stages====
Austria was drawn into UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying Group G alongside Poland, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Israel, and Latvia. Austria struggled in the first few games after a loss to Poland at home, a loss to Israel, and another to Latvia. Austria then won six of the last nine game matches and finished second in the group with 19 points. Marko Arnautović led the team in most goals and tied Poland&#x27;s Robert Lewandowski with nine goals. Austria qualified for their third European Championship finals, the second time Austria qualified for a major tournament consecutively since the 1954 and 1958 World Cups.

Austria was drawn into UEFA Euro 2020 Group C alongside the Netherlands, Ukraine, and debutants North Macedonia. Austria kicked off the opener with a 3–1 victory against North Macedonia, their first win at a European Championship and the first time scoring more than one goal in a group stage game. In the final group stage match, Austria only needed a draw against Ukraine to advance as one of the best third-place teams while a win guaranteed second place. They beat Ukraine 1–0 to secure their first knockout stages at the European Championship in second place in Group C, in addition to it being their first time advancing past the first round of a tournament since the 1982 World Cup. They faced Italy in the round of 16 at Wembley Stadium and lost 2–1 after extra time with Saša Kalajdžić scoring their only goal of the game in the 114th minute.

== Rivalry ==
While the match-up between Austria and Hungary is the second most-played international match in football (only Argentina and Uruguay, another two neighboring countries, have met each other in more matches), Austria&#x27;s arch rival, especially since World War II, is Germany. Though Austria has been the underdog (much like Scotland—England), the one-sided rivalry (much felt in Austria, not so in Germany) had produced some noteworthy victories by the underdog Austrians, most notably a 3:2 in Cordoba at the 1978 World Cup. This mythologized victory is, notably, not listed in German accounts of the Austria—German rivalry. As for Austria vs. Hungary, it is also notable in which both countries are the first European, non-British countries to play international matches, three full decades after the first ever international football match.

<text>Lethal Weapon 2 is a 1989 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Richard Donner, and starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Joss Ackland, Derrick O&#x27;Connor and Patsy Kensit. It is a sequel to the 1987 film &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and the second installment in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film series.

Gibson and Glover respectively reprise their roles as LAPD officers Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, who protect an irritating federal witness (Pesci), while taking on a gang of South African drug dealers hiding behind diplomatic immunity. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing (for Robert G. Henderson). The film received mostly positive reviews and earned more than $227 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Two years after the events of the first film, LAPD sergeants Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are pursuing unidentified suspects suspected of drug trafficking, only to find they have been transporting an illegal shipment of gold in the form of Krugerrand coins from the Afrikaner apartheid government of South Africa. Later, consul-general Arjen Rudd and security agent Pieter Vorstedt kill Hans, their man who lost the shipment of Krugerrands, and debate how to stir the police away from their activities. Pieter suggests warning Murtaugh off the investigation and commits a home invasion on his residence, causing Captain Murphy to reassign Riggs and Murtaugh to protecting an obnoxious federal witness, Leo Getz.

It soon becomes clear that both cases are related; after an attempt on Leo&#x27;s life, Riggs and Murtaugh learn of the former&#x27;s murky past laundering funds for vengeful drug smugglers. Leo provides them with information about how the laundering works and leads them to the gang, but upon dispatching his would-be assassin and returning with backup they are confronted by Rudd, who invokes diplomatic immunity on behalf of his &quot;associates&quot;, leaving the LAPD powerless to take action against them.

Though instructed to leave the case alone, Riggs begins openly harassing Rudd and romances his secretary, Rika van den Haas, a liberal-minded Afrikaner who despises her boss and his racial philosophy. Murtaugh enlists Leo&#x27;s help in creating a scene at the consulate that wins the support of anti-apartheid protesters outside. Vorstedt is dispatched to murder all of the officers investigating them while Murtaugh deduces that Rudd is attempting to ship funds from his smuggling ring in the United States to Cape Town via Los Angeles Harbor. Two assassins attack Murtaugh at his home, but he kills them both with his contractor&#x27;s nail gun, though Leo is abducted in the process.

Meanwhile, Vorstedt seizes Riggs at van den Haas&#x27; apartment and discloses that he was responsible for the death of Riggs&#x27;s wife years earlier during a botched assassination attempt on him. He has his men kill Rika by drowning her and orders them to do the same to Riggs, who escapes and brutally kills both men. He phones Murtaugh, declaring an intention to pursue Rudd and avenge his wife, Rika, and their fallen friends; Murtaugh willingly forsakes his badge to aid his partner. After rescuing Leo and destroying Rudd&#x27;s house, they head for the &quot;Alba Varden&quot;, Rudd&#x27;s freighter docked in the Port of Los Angeles, as the South Africans prepare their getaway with hundreds of millions in drug money.

While investigating a guarded cargo container at the docks, Riggs and Murtaugh discover Rudd&#x27;s laundered drug money, but are locked inside by Rudd&#x27;s men. They break out, scattering two pallets of the money into the harbor in the process. Riggs and Murtaugh engage in a firefight with Rudd&#x27;s men aboard the &quot;Alba Varden&quot; before separating to hunt down Rudd. Riggs confronts and fights Vorstedt hand-to-hand, stabs the latter with his own knife and drops a container on him. Rudd retaliates by shooting Riggs in the back multiple times and again invokes diplomatic immunity when Murtaugh aims his gun at him. Murtaugh fatally shoots him and declares that his immunity has &quot;just been revoked&quot;. Murtaugh then tends to Riggs, and they share a laugh as more LAPD personnel respond to the scene.

==Cast==

In addition, series regularswho appear in minor roles in all four films of the franchiseinclude: Damon Hines and Ebonie Smith as Murtaugh children Nick and Carrie, respectively; and Mary Ellen Trainor as psychologist Stephanie Woods.

==Production==

===Shane Black and Warren Murphy&#x27;s original &quot;Play Dirty&quot; script===
Following the success of the first film, Warner Bros. and producers decided to make the sequel. Producer Joel Silver asked writer of the first film Shane Black to write the script for the sequel in the spring of 1987 and Black agreed. Although he was struggling with personal issues, Black still managed to write the first draft along with his friend, novelist Warren Murphy, co-creator of Remo Williams (the lead character of &quot;The Destroyer&quot; novels). Their original title for the script was &quot;Play Dirty.

Although many people thought that their script was brilliant, it was rejected by Silver, the studio, and director Richard Donner for being too dark and bloody, and because in the ending of the script Riggs dies, while they wanted to keep him alive in case of further sequels. They also wanted the second film to focus more on comedy, while Black&#x27;s draft focused more on courage and heroics, like Riggs willing to die to protect Murtaugh and his family, due to his love for them.

When his script was rejected, Black felt that he had failed the producers. He initially offered to give his payment back, but his agent talked him out of it. Black also refused to re-write the script and quit from the project after working for six months on it. Black later said how the problem with the second film was that they did too much comedy, and how he dislikes the third and fourth films because of the way Riggs&#x27;s character was changed.

The final version of the script written by Jeffrey Boam that was used for filming was completely different from Black&#x27;s draft, other than the scene where the stilt house is destroyed. The character of Leo Getz was originally a minor character in Black&#x27;s draft with only one scene and few lines of dialogue. Some of the other differences include more graphic violence throughout the script, which included the South Africans being even more vicious than in the final film; at one point Shapiro, the female police officer working with Riggs and Murtaugh, is tortured to death by them. There was also a scene where Riggs gets tortured by them in a similar way to how he was in first film, but much worse. There was also an action scene in the script where a plane full of cocaine gets destroyed and cocaine falls over Los Angeles &quot;like snow.&quot;

In Black&#x27;s script the final battle took place on hills covered with a big brush fire, and after destruction of the stilt house Riggs chases the main villain Benedict (Pieter Vorstedt in the film), a much different and more dangerous character in the original script and Riggs&#x27;s &quot;arch-nemesis and worst nightmare&quot; according to Black, into the heart of the fire, after which Riggs gets stabbed and dies slowly from his wounds. The last scene in the script was Murtaugh watching the video tape that Riggs made before the final battle since he knew that he was going to die, and on which he says goodbye to Murtaugh.

Black&#x27;s reason for killing Riggs in his draft of the script, as he said in an interview, was that in first film Riggs was a &quot;suicidal mess&quot; who did not care about living or dying but his friendship with Murtaugh and his family was what helped him, and him sacrificing himself to save them would be the last thing he would have to do to be fully at peace. Black also said how the death scene he wrote for Riggs was &quot;beautiful&quot; and would make the audience cry. Black later labeled his rejected &quot;Play Dirty&quot; script &quot;the best thing I ever wrote&quot; and said he learned to trust his instincts after this experience. Black&#x27;s script was never released, despite failed attempts by fans to find a copy of it.

Director Richard Donner said in the film&#x27;s Blu-ray commentary that the film was shot in such a way that it could be edited with two different endings, one in which Riggs dies and one in which he lives. Audiences in test screenings responded well to Riggs&#x27;s survival, and this was kept, though the last shot in the film with the camera moving away from Murtaugh holding Riggs was shot for the ending in which he dies.

===Jeffrey Boam&#x27;s final script===
When the original Shane Black screenplay was changed, he left the series. The rewrites that resulted in the final film are by Jeffrey Boam (screenwriter for &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; and &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;). Boam also did some uncredited re-writing of the script for the first film when Donner thought that some parts of it were too dark and violent. Boam initially wrote two different drafts for his re-write of &quot; Lethal Weapon 2&quot;; one which was hard-boiled action script and one which had more comedy. He was told to mix the two drafts together and make a new one that was going to be used for filming. However, not only did Boam end up having to re-write the script many times even before filming started, but he also had to keep re-writing it during production since Donner would always want to improvise something new in a scene or demanded changes to be made on the script in the middle of filming. Boam also wrote the script for &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; and he once again had to re-write his script many times before and during filming of that sequel for same reasons. He also wrote an unused draft for the fourth film around January 1995 which had Riggs and Murtaugh fighting against a neo-Nazi survivalist militia group that was committing a terrorist attack in L.A.

Screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen said in October 2012 interview for craveonline that during the time when he was working as screenwriter for Warner Bros. and would often do lot of uncredited work on their films, he also worked on &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;. He said how amongst large chunks of the stuff he added in &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; script during re-writes were all the parts with South African villains. Although he was uncredited for his work on this film, he did get a credit for his work on &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; because he did a lot more work on that sequel.

Originally, the character of Rika was intended to survive, with the last scene in the film being Riggs and Rika eating Thanksgiving dinner with the Murtaughs, but the director decided to kill the character to increase Riggs&#x27; motivation to destroy the South African drug smugglers. The film was the debut of Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a crooked but whistle-blowing CPA who is placed in protective custody by Riggs and Murtaugh, and makes the detectives&#x27; more difficult due to his neurotic behavior. The Getz character remained a regular throughout the remainder of the film series.

===Filming===
The scene where Riggs is on the road outside Arjen&#x27;s stilt house and grabs onto the front of the truck (the same scene with the surfboard killing a driver) was filmed on March 21, 1989. The opening chase sequence was filmed on November 28, 1988. The scenes where Riggs and Rika are ambushed by helicopters at night on the beach were filmed at Marineland of the Pacific in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on &quot;Cobble Beach&quot;. Other portions of the film were shot in Palm Springs, California.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was released on Warner Bros. Records August 8, 1989, and was written and performed by Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton, and David Sanborn.

===Critical reception===

&quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;Though it includes a smashed car full of Krugerrands, a hillside house blown off its stilts and a bomb set under a toilet, the point of &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; is that Mel Gibson and Danny Glover get to race around in all that chaos, acting crazy. Before it skids out of control in the final sequence, the film is so careful to preserve its successful comic-action formula that it follows the most basic law of sequels. If you liked &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, you&#x27;ll like &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;; it&#x27;s almost as simple as that.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Michael Wilmington stated that &quot;though it&#x27;s nice to have a big-audience action movie attacking apartheid and the slaughter of sea mammals, instead of acting as an enlistment poster for the Army Air Corps, local vigilante groups or the reopening of the Vietnam War, the sentiments don&#x27;t really transcend the car crashes.&quot;

===Home media===
&quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; has been released on VHS and DVD numerous times, along with singular LaserDisc and Blu-ray Disc releases. The first DVD was released in 1997 and featured the film&#x27;s theatrical version. The Director&#x27;s Cut was released in 2000. Since then, numerous sets have been released that contain all four films in the series (featuring the same DVDs). The theatrical version was also released on Blu-ray in 2006.

<doc id="695230" wikidata="Q7315618" url="?curid=695230" title="Resistance distance">
<text>In graph theory, the resistance distance between two vertices of a simple, connected graph, , is equal to the resistance between two equivalent points on an electrical network, constructed so as to correspond to , with each edge being replaced by a resistance of one ohm. It is a metric on graphs.

==Definition==

On a graph , the resistance distance between two vertices and is
:formula_1
:where formula_2
with denotes the Moore–Penrose inverse, the Laplacian matrix of , is the number of vertices in , and is the matrix containing all 1s.

==Properties of resistance distance==

If then . For an undirected graph
:formula_3

===General sum rule===
For any -vertex simple connected graph and arbitrary matrix :

:formula_4

From this generalized sum rule a number of relationships can be derived depending on the choice of . Two of note are;

:formula_5

where the are the non-zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. This unordered sum 
:formula_6
is called the Kirchhoff index of the graph.

===Relationship to the number of spanning trees of a graph===

For a simple connected graph , the resistance distance between two vertices may be expressed as a function of the set of spanning trees, , of as follows:

:formula_7

where is the set of spanning trees for the graph . In other words, for an edge formula_8, the resistance distance between a pair of nodes formula_9 and formula_10 is the probability that the edge formula_11 is in a random spanning tree of formula_12.

===Relationship to random walks===

The resistance distance between vertices formula_13 and formula_13 is proportional to the commute time formula_15 of a random walk between formula_13 and formula_17. The commute time is the expected number of steps in a random walk that starts at formula_13, visits formula_17, and returns to formula_13. For a graph with formula_21 edges, the resistance distance and commute time are related as formula_22.

===As a squared Euclidean distance===
Since the Laplacian is symmetric and positive semi-definite, so is 
:formula_23 
thus its pseudo-inverse is also symmetric and positive semi-definite. Thus, there is a such that formula_24 and we can write:

:formula_25

showing that the square root of the resistance distance corresponds to the Euclidean distance in the space spanned by .

===Connection with Fibonacci numbers ===
A fan graph is a graph on vertices where there is an edge between vertex and for all , and there is an edge between vertex and for all .

The resistance distance between vertex and vertex is 
:formula_26 
where is the -th Fibonacci number, for .

<doc id="695239" wikidata="Q443870" url="?curid=695239" title="Reuben Fenton">
<text>Reuben Eaton Fenton (July 4, 1819August 25, 1885) was an American merchant and politician from New York. In the mid-19th century, he served as a U.S. Representative, a U.S. Senator, and as Governor of New York.

==Early life==

Fenton was born near Frewsburg, in Chautauqua County, New York, on July 4, 1819. He was the son of a farmer, and schoolteacher, George Washington Fenton (1783–1860) and Elsey (née Owen) Fenton (1790–1875). He had four siblings: Roswell Owen Fenton, George Washington Fenton Jr., William H.H. Fenton, and John Freeman Fenton.

His paternal grandparents were Roswell Fenton and Deborah (née Freeman) Fenton and his maternal grandfather was John Owen of Carroll, New York. His paternal aunt, Hannah Fenton was the wife of Lambert Van Buren of Kinderhook, New York.

He was educated in the district school, Cary&#x27;s Academy near Cincinnati, Ohio, and the Fredonia Academy.

==Career==
In 1840, he was named commander of the New York Militia&#x27;s 162nd Infantry Regiment with the rank of colonel. He became a lumber merchant, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1841. Fenton entered politics as a Democrat. He was Town Supervisor of Carroll from 1843 to 1850.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
He was elected as a Democrat to the 33rd United States Congress, and served from March 4, 1853, to March 3, 1855. In his first term in Congress, Fenton strongly opposed the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and unsuccessfully tried to persuade President Franklin Pierce and U.S. Secretary of State William L. Marcy to oppose the bill. He was defeated for re-election that year. He left the Democratic Party to help organize the Republican Party, and was later elected, as a Republican, to the 35th, 36th, 37th and 38th United States Congresses, and served from 1857 to 1865. During the 36th Congress, he served on the Committee on Invalid Pensions and in the 37th Congress, he served on the Committee on Claims. He served a total of five terms as congressman.

===Governor of New York===
He was the Governor of New York from 1865 to 1868, elected in 1864 and 1866. &quot;During his tenure, Cornell University was founded; a free public school system was initiated; and relief measures were sanctioned that benefited veterans.&quot; After serving two terms as governor, Fenton lost the November 1868 election to John T. Hoffman, a Tammany-backed Democrat. In 1868, he was among the candidates to be Vice President but the nomination went eventually to Schuyler Colfax, whom Fenton had previously been allied with in discussing &quot;growing public agitation about&quot; General George B. McClellan&#x27;s inactivity with President Abraham Lincoln during the U.S. Civil War.

===U.S. Senator===

In January 1869, he was elected a U.S. Senator from New York, succeeding Edwin D. Morgan and serving from 1869 to 1875 when Francis Kernan replaced him. While in the Senate, he served as Chair of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses during the 42nd Congress while also serving on the Committee on Manufactures and the Committee on Territories.

In July 1870, President Grant appointed Thomas Murphy to be the New York Customs House Collector, a position rich with patronage. Fenton opposed the nomination, but was unsuccessful when Sen. Roscoe Conkling gave a speech in which he produced proof that Fenton had stolen $12,000 as a young man rather than deliver it as a currier. Fenton had claimed he was robbed. Fenton, upon seeing the documents that had been produced by Conkling, slumped over his desk in defeat according to author Ron Chernow. The actions of Conkling secured his place as the leader of the Republican machine in New York and greatly reduced the clout of Fenton.

In 1872, he was among the Republicans opposed to President Ulysses S. Grant who joined the short-lived Liberal Republican Party.

===Later life===
In 1878, Fenton represented the United States at the International Monetary Conference in Paris. He was known as &quot;The Soldiers&#x27; Friend&quot; for his efforts to help returning Civil War veterans. He worked to remove tuition charges for public education, helped to establish six schools for training teachers, and signed the charter for Cornell University.

==Personal life==

In 1840, Fenton was married to Jane W. Frew (1821–1842), the daughter of John Frew. They had one daughter, Jane Frew Fenton. After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1842 Jane went to live with her maternal grandparents. Reuben got remarried on June 12, 1844, to Elizabeth Scudder (1824–1901). Together, they were the parents of:

* Josephine Fenton (1845–1928), who married Frank Edward Gifford (1845–1934).
* Jeannette Fenton (1849–1924), who married Albert Gilbert (1851–1912).
* Reuben Earle Fenton (1865–1895), who married Lillian Mai Hayden, daughter of Charles H. Hayden in 1890.

Fenton died on August 25, 1885, in Jamestown, and was buried in Lake View Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The town of Fenton in Broome County, New York, is named After Reuben Fenton.

Fenton&#x27;s family home was an Italian Villa style house built in 1863. He and his family lived there until the passing of Fenton&#x27;s wife. After her passing the house was abandoned before it became city property in 1919. It has been home to the Fenton History Center since 1964 and is now used as a museum dedicated to the local history of Chautauqua county. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

After his death, a building at The State University of New York at Fredonia, Fenton Hall, was named in his honor because he had attended the previous incarnation of the school, Fredonia Academy.

Fenton Avenue in The Bronx, New York, is named for him.

<doc id="695241" wikidata="Q1750766" url="?curid=695241" title="Scale invariance">
<text>In physics, mathematics and statistics, scale invariance is a feature of objects or laws that do not change if scales of length, energy, or other variables, are multiplied by a common factor, and thus represent a universality.

The technical term for this transformation is a dilatation (also known as dilation). Dilatations can form part of a larger conformal symmetry.

*In mathematics, scale invariance usually refers to an invariance of individual functions or curves. A closely related concept is self-similarity, where a function or curve is invariant under a discrete subset of the dilations. It is also possible for the probability distributions of random processes to display this kind of scale invariance or self-similarity.
*In classical field theory, scale invariance most commonly applies to the invariance of a whole theory under dilatations. Such theories typically describe classical physical processes with no characteristic length scale.
*In quantum field theory, scale invariance has an interpretation in terms of particle physics. In a scale-invariant theory, the strength of particle interactions does not depend on the energy of the particles involved.
*In statistical mechanics, scale invariance is a feature of phase transitions. The key observation is that near a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for an explicitly scale-invariant theory to describe the phenomena. Such theories are scale-invariant statistical field theories, and are formally very similar to scale-invariant quantum field theories.
*Universality is the observation that widely different microscopic systems can display the same behaviour at a phase transition. Thus phase transitions in many different systems may be described by the same underlying scale-invariant theory.
*In general, dimensionless quantities are scale-invariant. The analogous concept in statistics are standardized moments, which are scale-invariant statistics of a variable, while the unstandardized moments are not.

==Scale-invariant curves and self-similarity==
In mathematics, one can consider the scaling properties of a function or curve under rescalings of the variable . That is, one is interested in the shape of for some scale factor , which can be taken to be a length or size rescaling. The requirement for to be invariant under all rescalings is usually taken to be
:formula_1
for some choice of exponent Δ, and for all dilations . This is equivalent to   being a homogeneous function of degree Δ.

Examples of scale-invariant functions are the monomials formula_2, for which , in that clearly

:formula_3

An example of a scale-invariant curve is the logarithmic spiral, a kind of curve that often appears in nature. In polar coordinates , the spiral can be written as

:formula_4

Allowing for rotations of the curve, it is invariant under all rescalings ; that is, is identical to a rotated version of .

===Projective geometry===
The idea of scale invariance of a monomial generalizes in higher dimensions to the idea of a homogeneous polynomial, and more generally to a homogeneous function. Homogeneous functions are the natural denizens of projective space, and homogeneous polynomials are studied as projective varieties in projective geometry. Projective geometry is a particularly rich field of mathematics; in its most abstract forms, the geometry of schemes, it has connections to various topics in string theory.

===Fractals===

It is sometimes said that fractals are scale-invariant, although more precisely, one should say that they are self-similar. A fractal is equal to itself typically for only a discrete set of values , and even then a translation and rotation may have to be applied to match the fractal up to itself.

Thus, for example, the Koch curve scales with , but the scaling holds only for values of for integer . In addition, the Koch curve scales not only at the origin, but, in a certain sense, &quot;everywhere&quot;: miniature copies of itself can be found all along the curve.

Some fractals may have multiple scaling factors at play at once; such scaling is studied with multi-fractal analysis.

Periodic external and internal rays are invariant curves .

==Scale invariance in stochastic processes==
If is the average, expected power at frequency , then noise scales as
:formula_5
with Δ = 0 for white noise, Δ = −1 for pink noise, and Δ = −2 for Brownian noise (and more generally, Brownian motion).

More precisely, scaling in stochastic systems concerns itself with the likelihood of choosing a particular configuration out of the set of all possible random configurations. This likelihood is given by the probability distribution.

Examples of scale-invariant distributions are the Pareto distribution and the Zipfian distribution.

===Scale-invariant Tweedie distributions===
Tweedie distributions are a special case of exponential dispersion models, a class of statistical models used to describe error distributions for the generalized linear model and characterized by closure under additive and reproductive convolution as well as under scale transformation. These include a number of common distributions: the normal distribution, Poisson distribution and gamma distribution, as well as more unusual distributions like the compound Poisson-gamma distribution, positive stable distributions, and extreme stable distributions.
Consequent to their inherent scale invariance Tweedie random variables &quot;Y&quot; demonstrate a variance var(&quot;Y&quot;) to mean E(&quot;Y&quot;) power law:
: formula_6,
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are positive constants. This variance to mean power law is known in the physics literature as fluctuation scaling, and in the ecology literature as Taylor&#x27;s law.

Random sequences, governed by the Tweedie distributions and evaluated by the method of expanding bins exhibit a biconditional relationship between the variance to mean power law and power law autocorrelations. The Wiener–Khinchin theorem further implies that for any sequence that exhibits a variance to mean power law under these conditions will also manifest &quot;1/f&quot; noise.

The Tweedie convergence theorem provides a hypothetical explanation for the wide manifestation of fluctuation scaling and &quot;1/f&quot; noise. It requires, in essence, that any exponential dispersion model that asymptotically manifests a variance to mean power law will be required express a variance function that comes within the domain of attraction of a Tweedie model. Almost all distribution functions with finite cumulant generating functions qualify as exponential dispersion models and most exponential dispersion models manifest variance functions of this form. Hence many probability distributions have variance functions that express this asymptotic behavior, and the Tweedie distributions become foci of convergence for a wide range of data types.

Much as the central limit theorem requires certain kinds of random variables to have as a focus of convergence the Gaussian distribution and express white noise, the Tweedie convergence theorem requires certain non-Gaussian random variables to express &quot;1/f&quot; noise and fluctuation scaling.

===Cosmology===
In physical cosmology, the power spectrum of the spatial distribution of the cosmic microwave background is near to being a scale-invariant function. Although in mathematics this means that the spectrum is a power-law, in cosmology the term &quot;scale-invariant&quot; indicates that the amplitude, , of primordial fluctuations as a function of wave number, , is approximately constant, i.e. a flat spectrum. This pattern is consistent with the proposal of cosmic inflation.

==Scale invariance in classical field theory==
Classical field theory is generically described by a field, or set of fields, &quot;φ&quot;, that depend on coordinates, &quot;x&quot;. Valid field configurations are then determined by solving differential equations for &quot;φ&quot;, and these equations are known as field equations.

For a theory to be scale-invariant, its field equations should be invariant under a rescaling of the coordinates, combined with some specified rescaling of the fields,
:formula_7
:formula_8

The parameter Δ is known as the scaling dimension of the field, and its value depends on the theory under consideration. Scale invariance will typically hold provided that no fixed length scale appears in the theory. Conversely, the presence of a fixed length scale indicates that a theory is not scale-invariant.

A consequence of scale invariance is that given a solution of a scale-invariant field equation, we can automatically find other solutions by rescaling both the coordinates and the fields appropriately. In technical terms, given a solution, &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), one always has other solutions of the form

:formula_9

===Scale invariance of field configurations===
For a particular field configuration, &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), to be scale-invariant, we require that
:formula_10

where Δ is, again, the scaling dimension of the field.

We note that this condition is rather restrictive. In general, solutions even of scale-invariant field equations will not be scale-invariant, and in such cases the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken.

===Classical electromagnetism===

An example of a scale-invariant classical field theory is electromagnetism with no charges or currents. The fields are the electric and magnetic fields, E(x,&quot;t&quot;) and B(x,&quot;t&quot;), while their field equations are Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

With no charges or currents, these field equations take the form of wave equations
: formula_11
where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.

These field equations are invariant under the transformation
:formula_12

Moreover, given solutions of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, E(x, &quot;t&quot;) and B(x, &quot;t&quot;), it holds that 
E(&quot;λx, &quot;λt&quot;) and B(&quot;λx, &quot;λt&quot;) are also solutions.

===Massless scalar field theory===
Another example of a scale-invariant classical field theory is the massless scalar field (note that the name scalar is unrelated to scale invariance). The scalar field, is a function of a set of spatial variables, x, and a time variable, .

Consider first the linear theory. Like the electromagnetic field equations above, the equation of motion for this theory is also a wave equation,
:formula_13
and is invariant under the transformation
:formula_14
:formula_15

The name massless refers to the absence of a term formula_16 in the field equation. Such a term is often referred to as a `mass&#x27; term, and would break the invariance under the above transformation. In relativistic field theories, a mass-scale, is physically equivalent to a fixed length scale through
:formula_17
and so it should not be surprising that massive scalar field theory is &quot;not&quot; scale-invariant.

====&quot;φ&quot;4 theory====
The field equations in the examples above are all linear in the fields, which has meant that the scaling dimension, Δ, has not been so important. However, one usually requires that the scalar field action is dimensionless, and this fixes the scaling dimension of . In particular,
:formula_18
where is the combined number of spatial and time dimensions.

Given this scaling dimension for , there are certain nonlinear modifications of massless scalar field theory which are also scale-invariant. One example is massless φ4 theory for  = 4. The field equation is
:formula_19

(Note that the name 4 derives from the form of the Lagrangian, which contains the fourth power of .)

When  = 4 (e.g. three spatial dimensions and one time dimension), the scalar field scaling dimension is Δ = 1. The field equation is then invariant under the transformation
:formula_14
:formula_21
:formula_22

The key point is that the parameter must be dimensionless, otherwise one introduces a fixed length scale into the theory: For 4 theory, this is only the case in  = 4.
Note that under these transformations the argument of the function is unchanged.

==Scale invariance in quantum field theory==
The scale-dependence of a quantum field theory (QFT) is characterised by the way its coupling parameters depend on the energy-scale of a given physical process. This energy dependence is described by the renormalization group, and is encoded in the beta-functions of the theory.

For a QFT to be scale-invariant, its coupling parameters must be independent of the energy-scale, and this is indicated by the vanishing of the beta-functions of the theory. Such theories are also known as fixed points of the corresponding renormalization group flow.

===Quantum electrodynamics===
A simple example of a scale-invariant QFT is the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles. This theory actually has no coupling parameters (since photons are massless and non-interacting) and is therefore scale-invariant, much like the classical theory.

However, in nature the electromagnetic field is coupled to charged particles, such as electrons. The QFT describing the interactions of photons and charged particles is quantum electrodynamics (QED), and this theory is not scale-invariant. We can see this from the QED beta-function. This tells us that the electric charge (which is the coupling parameter in the theory) increases with increasing energy. Therefore, while the quantized electromagnetic field without charged particles is scale-invariant, QED is not scale-invariant.

===Massless scalar field theory===
Free, massless quantized scalar field theory has no coupling parameters. Therefore, like the classical version, it is scale-invariant. In the language of the renormalization group, this theory is known as the Gaussian fixed point.

However, even though the classical massless &quot;φ&quot;4 theory is scale-invariant in &quot;D&quot; = 4, the quantized version is not scale-invariant. We can see this from the beta-function for the coupling parameter, &quot;g&quot;.

Even though the quantized massless &quot;φ&quot;4 is not scale-invariant, there do exist scale-invariant quantized scalar field theories other than the Gaussian fixed point. One example is the Wilson–Fisher fixed point, below.

===Conformal field theory===
Scale-invariant QFTs are almost always invariant under the full conformal symmetry, and the study of such QFTs is conformal field theory (CFT). Operators in a CFT have a well-defined scaling dimension, analogous to the scaling dimension, &quot;∆&quot;, of a classical field discussed above. However, the scaling dimensions of operators in a CFT typically differ from those of the fields in the corresponding classical theory. The additional contributions appearing in the CFT are known as anomalous scaling dimensions.

===Scale and conformal anomalies===
The φ4 theory example above demonstrates that the coupling parameters of a quantum field theory can be scale-dependent even if the corresponding classical field theory is scale-invariant (or conformally invariant). If this is the case, the classical scale (or conformal) invariance is said to be anomalous. A classically scale-invariant field theory, where scale invariance is broken by quantum effects, provides an explication of the nearly exponential expansion of the early universe called cosmic inflation, as long as the theory can be studied through perturbation theory.

==Phase transitions==
In statistical mechanics, as a system undergoes a phase transition, its fluctuations are described by a scale-invariant statistical field theory. For a system in equilibrium (i.e. time-independent) in spatial dimensions, the corresponding statistical field theory is formally similar to a -dimensional CFT. The scaling dimensions in such problems are usually referred to as critical exponents, and one can in principle compute these exponents in the appropriate CFT.

===The Ising model===
An example that links together many of the ideas in this article is the phase transition of the Ising model, a simple model of ferromagnetic substances. This is a statistical mechanics model, which also has a description in terms of conformal field theory. The system consists of an array of lattice sites, which form a -dimensional periodic lattice. Associated with each lattice site is a magnetic moment, or spin, and this spin can take either the value +1 or −1. (These states are also called up and down, respectively.)

The key point is that the Ising model has a spin-spin interaction, making it energetically favourable for two adjacent spins to be aligned. On the other hand, thermal fluctuations typically introduce a randomness into the alignment of spins. At some critical temperature, , spontaneous magnetization is said to occur. This means that below the spin-spin interaction will begin to dominate, and there is some net alignment of spins in one of the two directions.

An example of the kind of physical quantities one would like to calculate at this critical temperature is the correlation between spins separated by a distance . This has the generic behaviour:
:formula_23
for some particular value of formula_24, which is an example of a critical exponent.

====CFT description====
The fluctuations at temperature are scale-invariant, and so the Ising model at this phase transition is expected to be described by a scale-invariant statistical field theory. In fact, this theory is the Wilson–Fisher fixed point, a particular scale-invariant scalar field theory.

In this context, is understood as a correlation function of scalar fields,
:formula_25
Now we can fit together a number of the ideas seen already.

From the above, one sees that the critical exponent, , for this phase transition, is also an anomalous dimension. This is because the classical dimension of the scalar field,
:formula_26
is modified to become
:formula_27
where is the number of dimensions of the Ising model lattice.

So this anomalous dimension in the conformal field theory is the &quot;same&quot; as a particular critical exponent of the Ising model phase transition.

Note that for dimension , can be calculated approximately, using the epsilon expansion, and one finds that
:formula_28.

In the physically interesting case of three spatial dimensions, we have =1, and so this expansion is not strictly reliable. However, a semi-quantitative prediction is that is numerically small in three dimensions.

On the other hand, in the two-dimensional case the Ising model is exactly soluble. In particular, it is equivalent to one of the minimal models, a family of well-understood CFTs, and it is possible to compute (and the other critical exponents) exactly,
:formula_29.

===Schramm–Loewner evolution===
The anomalous dimensions in certain two-dimensional CFTs can be related to the typical fractal dimensions of random walks, where the random walks are defined via Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE). As we have seen above, CFTs describe the physics of phase transitions, and so one can relate the critical exponents of certain phase transitions to these fractal dimensions. Examples include the 2&quot;d&quot; critical Ising model and the more general 2&quot;d&quot; critical Potts model. Relating other 2&quot;d&quot; CFTs to SLE is an active area of research.

==Universality==
A phenomenon known as universality is seen in a large variety of physical systems. It expresses the idea that different microscopic physics can give rise to the same scaling behaviour at a phase transition. A canonical example of universality involves the following two systems:
* The Ising model phase transition, described above.
* The liquid-vapour transition in classical fluids.

Even though the microscopic physics of these two systems is completely different, their critical exponents turn out to be the same. Moreover, one can calculate these exponents using the same statistical field theory. The key observation is that at a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for a scale-invariant statistical field theory to describe the phenomena. In a sense, universality is the observation that there are relatively few such scale-invariant theories.

The set of different microscopic theories described by the same scale-invariant theory is known as a universality class. Other examples of systems which belong to a universality class are:
* Avalanches in piles of sand. The likelihood of an avalanche is in power-law proportion to the size of the avalanche, and avalanches are seen to occur at all size scales.
* The frequency of network outages on the Internet, as a function of size and duration.
* The frequency of citations of journal articles, considered in the network of all citations amongst all papers, as a function of the number of citations in a given paper.
* The formation and propagation of cracks and tears in materials ranging from steel to rock to paper. The variations of the direction of the tear, or the roughness of a fractured surface, are in power-law proportion to the size scale.
* The electrical breakdown of dielectrics, which resemble cracks and tears.
* The percolation of fluids through disordered media, such as petroleum through fractured rock beds, or water through filter paper, such as in chromatography. Power-law scaling connects the rate of flow to the distribution of fractures.
* The diffusion of molecules in solution, and the phenomenon of diffusion-limited aggregation.
* The distribution of rocks of different sizes in an aggregate mixture that is being shaken (with gravity acting on the rocks).

The key observation is that, for all of these different systems, the behaviour resembles a phase transition, and that the language of statistical mechanics and scale-invariant statistical field theory may be applied to describe them.

==Other examples of scale invariance==

===Newtonian fluid mechanics with no applied forces===

Under certain circumstances, fluid mechanics is a scale-invariant classical field theory. The fields are the velocity of the fluid flow, formula_30, the fluid density, formula_31, and the fluid pressure, formula_32. These fields must satisfy both the Navier–Stokes equation and the continuity equation. For a Newtonian fluid these take the respective forms

formula_33
:formula_34
where formula_35 is the dynamic viscosity.

In order to deduce the scale invariance of these equations we specify an equation of state, relating the fluid pressure to the fluid density. The equation of state depends on the type of fluid and the conditions to which it is subjected. For example, we consider the isothermal ideal gas, which satisfies
:formula_36
where formula_37 is the speed of sound in the fluid. Given this equation of state, Navier–Stokes and the continuity equation are invariant under the transformations
:formula_14
:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41
Given the solutions formula_30 and formula_31, we automatically have that
formula_44 and formula_45 are also solutions.

===Computer vision===

In computer vision and biological vision, scaling transformations arise because of the perspective image mapping and because of objects having different physical size in the world. In these areas, scale invariance refers to local image descriptors or visual representations of the image data that remain invariant when the local scale in the image domain is changed. 
Detecting local maxima over scales of normalized derivative responses provides a general framework for obtaining scale invariance from image data.
Examples of applications include blob detection, corner detection, ridge detection, and object recognition via the scale-invariant feature transform.

<text>Home Alone 3 is a 1997 American crime comedy film directed by Raja Gosnell in his directorial debut, and written and produced by John Hughes. It is the third film in the &quot;Home Alone&quot; franchise, and the first not to feature the primary cast, director Chris Columbus, nor composer John Williams from previous installments. Starring Alex D. Linz and Haviland Morris, the story follows Alex Pruitt, an 8-year-old boy who defends his home from a dangerous group of international criminals working for a North Korean terrorist organization.

&quot;Home Alone 3&quot; was released on December 12, 1997, by 20th Century Fox. The film was a box-office success, but received negative reviews from critics, who compared it unfavorably to the previous entries in the series. It was followed by a made-for-television standalone sequel, &quot;Home Alone 4&quot;, in 2002, which features no returning cast or crew members; it features characters from the first two films, albeit portrayed by different actors.

==Plot==

Peter Beaupre, Alice Ribbons, Burton Jernigan, and Earl Unger are four internationally wanted criminals working for a Hong Kong–based terrorist organization linked to North Korea. In Silicon Valley, California, they steal a $10 million missile-cloaking microchip and hide it inside a radio-controlled car to get the chip past security at San Francisco International Airport. However, a passenger named Mrs. Hess inadvertently takes the criminals&#x27; bag containing the car, mistaking it for her identical bag. The criminals arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess&#x27;s suburban neighborhood to find the chip.

Eight-year-old Alex Pruitt is given the toy car by Hess as payment for shoveling her driveway. He returns home and discovers that he has chicken pox and must stay home from school. The next day, Alex discovers the criminals while spying on his neighbors and calls the police, but they are unable to help. Alex attaches a camera to the car and uses it to spy on them, leading to the criminals chasing it when they see it. Wondering what they want with the toy car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He calls the local U.S. Air Force Recruitment Center about the discovery and asks if they can forward the information about the chip to the authorities.

The criminals realize that Alex has been watching them and decide to break into the Pruitt house. Alex rigs the house with handmade booby traps with help from his pet rat Doris and his brother Stan&#x27;s parrot. The criminals break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the group pursue Alex around the house, he flees and rescues Hess, who has been taped to a chair in her garage by Alice. Beaupre ambushes Alex, but the latter uses a bubble gun resembling a Glock to scare him off.

FBI agents and the police later arrive and arrest Alice, Jernigan, and Unger, having received a tip from the recruitment center. However, Beaupre hides in a makeshift snow fort in the backyard. Stan&#x27;s parrot discovers him and threatens to light fireworks, which are lined around the inside. Beaupre offers a cracker in exchange for silence, but the parrot demands two. Since Beaupre has only one, the parrot lights the fireworks, alerting the authorities to Beaupre&#x27;s location.

That evening, the Pruitts, Mrs. Hess, and the authorities hold a celebration for Alex as the Pruitt house is being repaired, with Alex&#x27;s father Jack returning home from a business trip. At the police department, the criminals are shown to have contracted Alex&#x27;s chicken pox during their mugshots.

==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;Home Alone 3&quot; was pitched at the same time as &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992), and both films were meant to be produced simultaneously; however, those plans fell through. The idea for a third &quot;Home Alone&quot; movie was revived in the mid-1990s; early drafts called for Macaulay Culkin to reprise the role of Kevin McCallister as a teenager. However, by 1994, Culkin had taken a hiatus from acting. As a result, the idea was reworked, centering on a new cast of characters.
It was filmed in Chicago and Evanston, Illinois, with the airport scenes at the beginning of the film being shot at two different concourses at O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

Principal photography began on December 2, 1996, and filming concluded on March 22, 1997.

Fox Family Films was the division of 20th Century Fox responsible for the production on the film.

==Music==

==Release==

&quot;Home Alone 3&quot; was released theatrically on December 12, 1997, by 20th Century Fox. The film later released on VHS and Laserdisc on June 2, 1998, and on DVD on November 3, 1998, which was later reissued in December 2007 (and, as part of &quot;Home Alone&quot; multi-packs, in 2006 and 2008). While the DVD presents the film in its original Widescreen format (1.85:1), it is presented in a non-anamorphic 4:3 matte.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $79,082,515 worldwide, against an estimated budget of $32 million.

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and said that he found it to be &quot;fresh, very funny, and better than the first two.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Home Alone 3&quot; was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel at the 18th Golden Raspberry Awards, losing to &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;.

==Novelization==

<text>Lethal Weapon 3 is a 1992 American buddy cop action film directed by Richard Donner and written by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen. The sequel to &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; (1989), it is the third installment in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film series and stars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, and Stuart Wilson.

In &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;, LAPD Sergeants Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Glover) pursue Jack Travis (Wilson), a former LAPD lieutenant turned ruthless arms dealer, during the six days prior to Murtaugh&#x27;s retirement. Riggs and Murtaugh are joined by Leo Getz (Pesci) as well as internal affairs Sergeant Lorna Cole (Russo).

The film was a box office success, grossing over $320 million worldwide. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing installment in the series overall. The film was followed by &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; in 1998.

==Plot==
A week before his retirement, L.A.P.D. Sergeant Roger Murtaugh and his partner Martin Riggs are demoted to uniform duties after failing to defuse an office building bomb. While on street patrol they witness the theft of an armored car, and help to thwart the crime assisted by armored car driver Delores. One of the two thieves gets away, but the other is taken into police custody. The suspect is found to be a known associate of Jack Travis, a former LAPD lieutenant who is running an arms smuggling ring in Los Angeles. The department is further concerned that the thieves were using armor-piercing bullets. Riggs and Murtaugh are re-promoted and assigned to work with Sergeant Lorna Cole from internal affairs to track down Travis.

Travis is currently negotiating with mobster Tyrone regarding his arms deal. The armored car thief that escaped is brought to Travis, who subsequently kills him in front of Tyrone for putting the police on his trail. Travis then uses his old police credentials to enter the interrogation room and kill the suspect in custody before he can be interviewed. Travis is unaware that closed-circuit cameras have been installed in the station, and Cole is able to confirm Travis&#x27; identity. While the three are reviewing the footage, their good friend Leo Getz, who has been helping Murtaugh sell his house, arrives and immediately recognizes Travis from several prior business deals and his love of ice hockey. Murtaugh, Riggs, and Getz narrowly miss capturing Travis at a hockey match, and Getz is wounded. However, Getz manages to provide them with information of a warehouse Travis owns, which they suspect is where he has stored his arms shipments.

Riggs and Murtaugh contact Cole for backup before they raid the warehouse, and stop at a food truck to wait for her. As they wait for their food, they witness a drug deal and attempt to stop it. Murtaugh kills a gunman who fired at them, while the rest escape. Murtaugh recognizes the gunman, Darryl, a close friend of his son Nick. With Murtaugh emotionally distraught, Riggs and Cole head to the warehouse, where they successfully secure his next arms shipment delivery. That night, Riggs and Cole find they have feelings for each other and sleep together. Riggs later finds a guilt-ridden Murtaugh drunk in his boat and consoles him in time for Darryl&#x27;s funeral. There, Darryl&#x27;s father passionately insists that Murtaugh find the person responsible for giving Darryl the gun.

Cole finds that Darryl&#x27;s gun, the armor-piercing bullets, and the arms they recovered were originally in police custody, meant to be destroyed, and were stolen by Travis; they revoke his credentials from the system. They further tie the guns to Tyrone and interrogate him. Tyrone directs them to an auto garage where many of his henchmen work from. Riggs, Murtaugh, and Cole are able to arrest several of the men. Meanwhile, Travis has one of his men hack into the computer system to find another arms storage area. He then forces Captain Murphy under gunpoint to take him to this new facility so he can steal the guns using Murphy&#x27;s credentials. Cole finds the evidence of hacking and Murphy&#x27;s absence, and the three, along with a rookie cop, Edwards, who looks up to Riggs and Murtaugh, intercept Travis. They are able to rescue Murphy and stop Travis and his men before he can take the weapons, but Edwards is killed during their pursuit.

Getz provides information on a housing development owned by Travis&#x27;s shell company. Riggs, Murtaugh, and Cole infiltrate the site at night and enter a large-scale gunfight. Riggs sets the construction site on fire and most of Travis&#x27; men are killed, while Travis wounds Cole. When Travis uses a bulldozer to chase down Riggs, using its blade as a bullet shield, Murtaugh tosses Daryl&#x27;s gun, now loaded with the armor-piercing bullets, to Riggs, who then shoots and kills Travis through the blade. After finding out Cole wore two layers of kevlar vests, Riggs admits his love for her as she is taken away in a chopper.

The next day, Murtaugh&#x27;s family is celebrating his retirement, when Murtaugh reveals to Getz that he has decided to not sell the house and stay with the force, preserving his partnership with Riggs, who announces his relationship with Cole to Murtaugh.

==Cast==

In addition, Delores Hall appears as Delores, the armoured car driver. Other series regulars, who appear in minor roles in all four films of the franchise, include: Damon Hines and Ebonie Smith as Murtaugh children Nick and Carrie, respectively; and Mary Ellen Trainor as psychologist Stephanie Woods.

==Production==
The movie was filmed from October 1991 to January 1992.

Richard Donner, an animal-rights and pro-choice activist, placed many posters and stickers for these causes in the film. Of note are the T-shirt worn by one of Murtaugh&#x27;s daughters (the actress&#x27;s idea), an 18-wheeler with an anti-fur slogan on the side, and a sticker on a locker in the police station.

===Demolition scenes===
In the film&#x27;s first scene, Riggs accidentally sets off a bomb that destroys the ICSI Building. The ICSI Building was actually the former City Hall building of Orlando, Florida, located at the intersection of Orange Avenue and South Street in Downtown Orlando. Warner Bros. decided to use the destruction of the building in the film, and as a result paid $500,000 for the demolition. From August to October 1991, the production crew fitted the old Orlando City Hall building featured in the opening scene with carefully placed explosives to create the visual effect of a bomb explosion. Bill Frederick, then mayor of Orlando, Florida, was the policeman who sarcastically claps and said &quot;Bravo!&quot; to Murtaugh and Riggs after the explosion.

The building was demolished so that it would collapse slightly forward (toward Orange Avenue), minimizing the chances of it damaging the new City Hall building, built directly behind it. The space was cleared out and became a plaza for the new City Hall, with a fountain and a monument.

The film&#x27;s climax scene, where an under-construction housing development is set ablaze, was filmed at an unfinished housing development in Lancaster, California. The unfinished houses, which had been sitting abandoned and slated to be torn down, were coated in flame retardant and propane gas lines to ensure that the houses could withstand re-shoots. The original homes were eventually demolished and was eventually redeveloped into another housing development.

During the closing credits, Riggs and Murtaugh drive up to an old hotel where another bomb has been placed. Before they (their doubles) can exit the car, the bomb explodes and destroys the building. The hotel was actually the former Soreno Hotel in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida. The film&#x27;s producers agreed to help with the cost of the 68-year-old building&#x27;s implosion for the purposes of their film.

===Hockey game===
A November 26, 1991 NHL game between the Los Angeles Kings and the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Great Western Forum served as the basis for the hockey scene featured in the movie.
The league allowed production to capture the real-life action, although goaltender Kelly Hrudey eventually became annoyed with the additional lights used by the crew and asked filming to stop.

The NHL also let Donner stage part of the scene, where Riggs commandeers the arena&#x27;s PA system to lure out Jack Travis, during the game&#x27;s second intermission. It was completed in two takes. However, the director was not allowed to film the segment where Riggs chases down Travis onto the ice that evening. It was completed after a Kings practice. In closer shots, these sequences used extras dressed in unlicensed jerseys that only roughly resemble those worn by the actual teams. A contemporary AP report cites &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;&#x27;s excessive violence as the reason why the NHL limited its collaboration. However, the organization took a relaxed stance towards the more intense &quot;Sudden Death&quot; a few years later. The Los Angeles Kings later featured in a season three episode of the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; TV series, entitled &quot;What The Puck?&quot;.

===Writing===
Jeffrey Boam&#x27;s first two drafts of the script were different from the final film. The character of Lorna for example was not a woman in original drafts, but the original character still had the same personality and was just as lethal and crazy as Riggs, making him his match. Riggs also had an affair with Roger&#x27;s daughter Rianne, and a few parts in the final film where Roger suspects that Riggs and Rianne are interested in each other are only parts left from the original drafts.

Director Richard Donner demanded some big changes on the script which included changing the original character of Lorna (who had a different name in earlier drafts) into a woman and turning her into Riggs&#x27;s girlfriend. He also re-worked the script to be less story-oriented and not focus on the main villains but instead on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh. He also toned down action scenes from the script and brought back Leo Getz into the story. All of his scenes were written in afterwards. In the original script Leo had left L.A. for New York. Boam had some disagreements with changes that Donner made, but he was not against them. Boam was fired after he wrote his first two drafts of the script. One of the reasons for this was because Donner wasn&#x27;t interested in the script and he disagreed with some parts of Boam&#x27;s original draft. After another writer, Robert Mark Kamen, was hired to re-write the script, Boam was called to return to work on it again. The filmmakers realized that Kamen&#x27;s re-writes were not working. Boam asked to work alone on the script and ended up constantly changing it from October 1991 until January 1992 while filming was taking place. These types of changes also occurred during the filming of &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;.

According to Kamen in a 2012 interview, many of his writing contributions ended up in the final film. Kamen also wrote many parts of the previous film in the series, with the most significant portions being the South African villains.

Screenwriter Jeffrey Boam is credited twice in the &#x27;screenplay by&#x27; credits. This is because he did one draft by himself (granting him the first credit) and a second draft collaborating with Robert Mark Kamen (granting him the second credit). In this rare scenario, Boam was hired to rewrite his own script with a second writer. After receiving the unusual writing credits, the advertising department assumed it was a misprint and produced posters with the credits &quot;Story by Jeffrey Boam, Screenplay by Jeffrey Boam and Robert Mark Kamen&quot;. After a few of the posters had been sent out, the WGA contacted the department, telling them that the initial credits were the correct ones, and ordering the posters to be recalled and destroyed.

Carrie Fisher was an uncredited script doctor on the film.

===Martial arts===
Russo received martial arts training for a month before shooting from Cheryl Wheeler-Dixon, who had a karate background and was a former kickboxing champion, and Wheeler-Dixon was also her stunt double. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor Rorion Gracie, who had taught Gibson and Gary Busey in the first movie of the series in 1987, also provided training to Russo and acted as stuntman for a fight scene.

==Promotion==
To promote the film, theater lobbies featured a 3-D cutout of the film poster of Riggs and Murtaugh posing with their guns and Leo Getz peeking from the background. On the display, there was a motor which helped Leo&#x27;s head bob up and down from behind them.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; made $33.2 million during its opening weekend. The $35 million film was a big box-office success, earning $145 million. Although slightly less than the $150 million domestic gross of the first sequel, it was nevertheless the second-most successful summer film of 1992 (after &quot;Batman Returns&quot;) and the fifth most profitable film of the year, as well as the highest-grossing in the film series worldwide with $320 million worldwide.

After the film&#x27;s success, Warner Bros. head Robert A. Daly bought Land Rovers for Gibson, Glover, Pesci, Russo, Donner, Boam, and producer Joel Silver. Daly later said &quot;It cost us $320,000 to buy those Land Rovers, and we were criticized left and right for the expense. Do you know what it got us? &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;, which made $285 million&quot;.

===Critical reception===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, awarding it 3 out of 4 stars.

===Home media===
&quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; has been released on VHS and DVD numerous times. The first DVD was released in 1997 and featured the film&#x27;s theatrical version. The 1997 DVD contains both the widescreen and the pan and scan editions. The Director&#x27;s Cut was released in 2000. Since then, numerous sets have been released that contain all four films in the series (featuring the same DVDs). The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in 2011.

==Soundtrack==
Lethal Weapon 3 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on June 9, 1992, on audio cassette and CD. The soundtrack was performed and composed by Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton, and David Sanborn. Its title songs, &quot;It&#x27;s Probably Me&quot;, and &quot;Runaway Train&quot; were written and performed by Eric Clapton with the assistance of Sting and Elton John respectively.

In 2013 La-La Land Records issued the complete score on a two-disc set as part of Lethal Weapon Soundtrack Collection.

<text>Lethal Weapon 4 is a 1998 American buddy cop action film directed and produced by Richard Donner, and starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Chris Rock, and Jet Li (in his international film debut). It is the fourth installment in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film series. It is the last film in the series directed by Donner before his death, and the latest to be released theatrically.

The film was released on July 10, 1998, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $285 million worldwide, becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of 1998.

A sequel titled &quot;Lethal Finale&quot; is in development for the streaming service Max. Glover and Gibson will reprise their roles as Riggs and Murtaugh, with Gibson also in talks to direct.

==Plot==
Lorna Cole is pregnant with LAPD Sergeant Martin Riggs&#x27;s baby; they are not married, but both are thinking about it. LAPD Sergeant Roger Murtaugh&#x27;s daughter Rianne is also pregnant. Due to issues with the department&#x27;s insurance carrier over Riggs and Murtaugh&#x27;s actions as sergeants, the Police Chief has Captain Murphy promote them to captains.

The officers, along with Leo Getz, come upon a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring after running an oceangoing vessel aground, though the captain of the boat escapes. In the subsequent investigation, Murtaugh finds the Hong family hiding from US Immigration officers to avoid deportation. Murtaugh offers them shelter in his home, and their families, along with Riggs and Cole, quickly bond. Grandfather Hong reveals he is looking for his uncle, a skilled engraver, who had paid for their passage to the United States. Riggs discovers through Lorna that the father of Rianne&#x27;s unborn child is Detective Lee Butters. The family is hiding this from Murtaugh, as he would not approve of his daughter being with a police officer.

Continued investigation of the smuggling ring leads the officers to &quot;Uncle&quot; Benny Chan, a crime boss operating from a Chinatown restaurant. There, they are introduced to high-ranking Triad negotiator Wah Sing Ku. Chan forces them out of his restaurant when the officers show no probable cause. Riggs pulls the fire alarm so that the sprinklers can go off, forcing all the restaurant customers to flee. Outside, Riggs spots the escaped ship captain and tries to give chase but fails to capture him. However, Ku later intercepts the captain and kills him as punishment for attracting the police&#x27;s attention. Chan and Ku take steps to eliminate all those in on their plans.

Hong is able to contact his uncle, but this leads the Triads to Murtaugh&#x27;s house. Ku and the Triad thugs kidnap the Hongs, tie up Murtaugh, his family, Riggs, and Cole and set the house ablaze. Ping, Hong&#x27;s grandson, has evaded capture and helps to free the others in time. Though Riggs and Murtaugh chase down and kill some of the Triad members, Ku escapes. Ku brings Mr. Hong to his uncle at a warehouse, where he has been engraving plates for a counterfeiting operation for Ku and Chan in exchange for transit for his family. Ku kills Hong in front of his uncle to assure his continued work.

With Getz serving as a distraction, the officers confront Chan at his dentist&#x27;s office to interrogate him with laughing gas for more information but are unable to get any leads, and during which Riggs and Butters accidentally reveal the family secret to Murtaugh. Later, as they discuss what they know with Detective Ng, who has worked on cases involving the Chinese government before, Ng recognizes that Ku must be trying to negotiate with a corrupt Chinese general for the release of the Four Fathers, high-ranking Triad members that include Ku&#x27;s brother. New information leads them to the abandoned warehouse where they find the bodies of Hong, his uncle, and Chan, the latter two killed by Ku after they served their usefulness. Knowing that Ku plans to use counterfeit money, the police intercept the exchange between Ku and the general, telling the general that the money is fake. The enraged general reacts by executing most of the Four Fathers before being shot and killed by the Triads, at which a firefight breaks out between the Triad, the general&#x27;s private army, and the police; most of the Triad and army are killed, and Butters is wounded shielding Murtaugh. Ku attempts to escape with his brother, but his brother is shot and killed by Murtaugh. Riggs and Murtaugh pursue Ku to a pier where they engage him in a brutal fistfight. Murtaugh impales Ku through the stomach with a rebar before being knocked out by Ku, after which the pier collapses and sends Riggs and Ku into the water. Riggs is able to find a Kalashnikov assault rifle and finish off Ku, while Murtaugh recovers in time to rescue Riggs from a piece of concrete that had pinned him underwater.

Later, Riggs visits his dead wife&#x27;s grave and asks her for advice about his impending marriage with Lorna, about which he still has doubts; Getz arrives and offers a heartfelt childhood story that gives Riggs both a new light on the situation and a new perspective of Getz. They soon discover Lorna is about to give birth and race to the hospital, where Riggs and Lorna are ceremonially married by a rabbi just before she enters labor. Their son and Rianne&#x27;s daughter are born, and Murtaugh accepts Butters as his son-in-law. Murphy gives Riggs and Murtaugh their rank of sergeant back since the city is insured again and Hong&#x27;s family is granted asylum.

==Cast==

In addition, series regularswho appear in minor roles in all four films of the franchiseinclude: Damon Hines and Ebonie Smith as Murtaugh children Nick and Carrie, respectively; and Mary Ellen Trainor as psychologist Stephanie Woods.

==Production==
In early 1993, after the release of &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;, Warner Bros. and producer Joel Silver tried buying a new spec script titled &quot;Simon Says&quot; in hopes of rewriting it into a script for &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;. Written by Jonathan Hensleigh, the story was about a police detective and a shop owner forced to find and stop bombs planted all over a city as part of a mad bomber&#x27;s revenge plot against the detective.

However, 20th Century Fox purchased the script first, planning a project for Brandon Lee&#x27;s next film after &quot;The Crow&quot;. It was considered for a standalone film or to be re-written into a sequel to his 1992 action film, &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, when Lee was killed during filming on &quot;The Crow&quot;. Fox would then use the script as the basis for a third &quot;Die Hard&quot; film they were having trouble developing. After many rewrites by several writers, it was finally made into &quot;Die Hard With a Vengeance&quot; (1995).

In July 1993, Warner Bros. and Silver started working on not just the fourth &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film but a fifth as well. Screenwriter and script doctor Jonathan Lemkin, who had just done some uncredited work for them on &quot;Demolition Man&quot; (1993), was hired to write the script for &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; while another writer worked on the script for &quot;Lethal Weapon 5&quot;. According to Silver, the plan was to shoot both films back-to-back, with the possibility of using the best parts of both scripts for a single film.

In June 1994, Richard Donner was still planning on making both films. Asked about them in an interview at the time, however, Mel Gibson said he was not interested in doing any more &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; sequels.

Between late 1994 and early 1995, screenwriter Jeffrey Boam was brought in to rewrite the script for the fourth film. Boam had previously done uncredited work on the first &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, rewrote an original script by Shane Black and Warren Murphy called &quot;Play Dirty&quot; into &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, and wrote the story and script for &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;. He was initially unsure of working on the film, as he had problems with the script and following a bad experience on the third film: he had to keep rewriting that script all through filming and was fired at one point only to be rehired later. Agreeing to work on the fourth script, he tossed out the existing story and began work on his own. His first draft was completed in January 1995, focusing on Riggs and Murtaugh fighting neo-Nazi survivalists committing terrorist attacks on L.A., including using Stinger missiles to attempt to shoot down a jet carrying the Los Angeles Lakers. He said in an interview at the time that he would probably have to write at least three more drafts. By October 1995, Boam was still working on the script, while at the same time also working on a fourth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film which went unproduced.

Peter Bart&#x27;s book &quot;The Gross: The Hits, The Flops -- The Summer That Ate Hollywood&quot; offered many details regarding &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;&#x27;s troubled production, from writing to release. While Boam was still working on his version of the story, other writers were brought in to pen their own versions, all of which were rejected. Though many were positive on the darker, edgier, more serious tone of Boam&#x27;s script that recalled the first film, it was ultimately rejected because of the tone. Finally, Warner Bros. decided that they wanted to focus on a storyline involving the Chinese Triads. Boam would later say he felt that the main plot about counterfeiting Chinese money was not a good or suspenseful enough plot for a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; sequel.

Jonathan Lemkin was once again brought in to write the first version of the script involving the Triads, about four years after he wrote his first rejected script. Although his new script was received very positively, Warner Bros. again had other writers work on their own versions of the story. Alfred Gough and Miles Millar wrote one of the unused scripts; they would be credited with Lemkin for the story of the finished film.

Silver ultimately brought in TV writer Channing Gibson to work on the script, after he was impressed by Gibson&#x27;s rewrite of a spec script titled &quot;Sandblast&quot;, an action adventure thriller by screenwriter Steven Maeda described as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) meets &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; (1993)&quot;. Gibson took the gig thinking it would be a more relaxed writing job than anything he did for TV. However, much like the previous two sequels, the script kept getting changed and rewritten over and over again. Gibson would end up doing more work and revisions on it than on all of his TV work put together. Production even started with only half of the script. The ending was not written until it was finally time to film it.

The characters of Leo Getz and Lee Butters were not in the original scripts. Joe Pesci was hired and paid $1 million for three weeks of work, forcing rewrites. Gibson was &quot;three-fourths&quot; through his newest draft when Chris Rock was hired, which caused yet another rewrite. Butters was originally written to be a homosexual detective. When they started filming the police station scene between Riggs, Murtaugh, Leo, and Butters, everyone felt the character did not work. He was changed to be Rianne&#x27;s husband and father to her unborn child. The two only share one scene in the final film with no written dialogue, due to last minute changes made to his character.

Besides Lemkin, Gibson, Gough and Millar, other writers did uncredited work on the script, including Michael Curtis, Greg Malins, Fred Dekker (who came up with the scene where Riggs and Murtaugh drive their car off the freeway and through the building), and even Boam was brought in to work on the script.

The film entered production in early January 1998 with a planned summer release of that same year. Due to issues during filming, including the script changes, production ended around mid May, less than two months before its scheduled July release. Editors had to work very quickly to have the film ready, which is why the trailers feature some deleted and alternate scenes which are not in the film. Despite this, the film was finished and released as planned.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; debuted at 1 at the box office with $34.05 million. Although the film grossed $130 million in the U.S., it was not considered a runaway financial success as the previous three films had been.

Shooting began in January 1998, just months before the film&#x27;s release, with a production budget estimated at $120–$150 million (although Warner Bros. maintained it cost less than $100 million) and an additional $50 million spent on marketing and distribution. This made the fourth film the most expensive entry of the series. Its profit margin was saved in part due to the combined foreign box office sales making the film gross approximately $285 million in total, making the second highest-grossing film in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film series behind, &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; (1992). Still, like its predecessors, &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; was among the top ten grossing films of its release year.

===Critical reception===

James Berardinelli gave the film three stars out of four, writing: &quot;Given the expectations that constrain it, &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; is probably the best motion picture that could possibly result from another teaming of Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. The series has lost a lot of steam since the first two entries, and, although the fourth movie ratchets up the energy level from the moribund state of the disappointing &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;, there&#x27;s no sense of spontaneity.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; two stars out of four, writing: &quot;&quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; has all the technical skill of the first three movies in the series, but lacks the secret weapon, which was conviction. All four movies take two cop buddies and put them into spectacular and absurd action sequences, but the first three at least went through the motions of taking the plot seriously (and the first one did such a good job, it made my &#x27;best 10&#x27; list of that year). This time, we&#x27;re watching an exercise.&quot;

Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;stupid and violent delicacy&quot; that balances a &quot;patented blend of high action and low comedy&quot;.

The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actor for Pesci.

===Home media===
&quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; has been released on VHS and DVD numerous times. It has been re-released in numerous sets that contain all four films in the series. &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; was released on Blu-ray Disc as part of a box set with the additional &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; films on May 22, 2012.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s music was composed by Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton, and David Sanborn. This was the only film in the series not to have a soundtrack album released alongside it, but in 2013 La-La Land Records released the score as discs seven and eight of its limited edition &quot;Lethal Weapon Soundtrack Collection&quot;.

==Sequel==
There had long been talk of a fifth &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film, although both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover had initially expressed a lack of interest. In 2007, Moviehole.net received word from sources that Warner Bros. were in the early stages of trying to relaunch the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series sometime in 2009 or later. A spec script treatment was written by Shane Black and Chuck Mondry, leading to rumors that the sequel was on fast track by Warner Bros. with Black in the director&#x27;s chair. In 2008, Richard Donner said, &quot;Mel turned it down. I would like to think that Mel turned it down because I wasn&#x27;t involved.&quot; Donner said that he and &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot; writer Channing Gibson &quot;had an incredibly strong story for the fifth movie&quot; but that the studio had opted to work with Joel Silver instead.

In November 2017, Mel Gibson hinted that a fifth movie might happen and that he, Richard Donner, and Danny Glover have discussed the idea to return. In December 2017, Donner confirmed in an interview on the Spocklight podcast that Gibson and Glover have agreed to return as Riggs and Murtaugh respectively and that he has a story all set. The only obstacle is Warner Bros. greenlighting the film. Channing Gibson remains involved as screenwriter. The story will take place in present-day and is intended to be the final film in the series. In February 2018, Donner revealed the film&#x27;s official title to be &quot;Lethal Finale&quot;; while also stating that the film is being held up by the production company and story. In January 2020, producer Dan Lin confirmed that &quot;Lethal Weapon 5&quot; is in active development, with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover confirmed to return, and Richard Donner returning to direct, but that a script had not yet been finalized. In December 2020, Richard Donner confirmed that he was developing the sequel and would produce and direct it, adding that it would be the last film he directs. However, Donner died on July 5, 2021, leaving the fate of the film unknown. Mel Gibson has been approached for potentially directing the film.

On November 15, 2021, Gibson confirmed that he is in talks to direct and star in the fifth &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; film, saying that he would be helming the film to honor Donner. It was also revealed that Richard Wenk (&quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;Jack Reacher: Never Go Back&quot;) had drafted a screenplay. The production will be exclusive to Max with no theatrical release.

<text>John Thompson Hoffman (January 10, 1828March 24, 1888) was the 23rd governor of New York (1869–72). He was also recorder of New York City (1861–65) and the 78th mayor of New York City (1866–68). Connections to the Tweed Ring ruined his political career, in spite of the absence of evidence to show personal involvement in corrupt activities. He is to date the last New York City mayor elected Governor of New York and the last elected to higher office.

==Early life==

He was born in Ossining in Westchester County, New York. He was the son of Jane Ann (Thompson) and Adrian Kissam Hoffman, a physician in Westchester County. His father&#x27;s parents, Philip L. Hoffman and Helena Kissam, were &quot;among the most valuable members of early society in New York, and the founders of many public charities and benevolent works,&quot; &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; effused.

He attended Union College starting in 1843 in the junior class, but had to leave for a time due to ill health, eventually graduating in 1846. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1849 and practiced in Manhattan.

Hoffman became active in the Tammany Hall faction of the Democratic Party. He was a member of the New York State Democratic Central Committee beginning in 1848, and served as New York City Recorder from 1861 to 1866. Hoffman served as mayor of New York City from 1866 to 1868. from 1866 to 1868 he was Grand Sachem, or leader, of the Tammany Hall organization.

==High hopes of reformers==
When he was elected mayor in 1865, reformers had high hopes for him. A front-page article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; intoned:

It is many years since the city of New York has chosen for her Chief Magistrate a man of the position and reputation of John T. Hoffman. He is not only a gentleman of high social position, but a lawyer of distinction, a judge of eminent probity, a representative by descent of some of the oldest New York families, a citizen of unblemished reputation ...

==Guilt by association==

Hoffman was elected governor in 1868, the last New York City mayor to accomplish this feat and the last New York City mayor elected to higher office. Hoffman&#x27;s election was aided by Tammany Hall under the leadership of its boss William Tweed. Later on the fact that Hoffman had aid from Tweed, and his voter majority was so large for that time, would be recalled as proof that the governor was a member of the notorious Tweed Ring.

In actuality, while Tweed did frequently see Hoffman in Albany on various votes and projects, it was no more than any other major Democrat in New York State. But they worked harmoniously together, and Tweed aided Hoffman in getting re-elected in 1870. Shortly afterwards a new city charter was enacted which granted more local autonomy to New York City. Such reform had been discussed for decades, but Tweed with Hoffman brought it to fruition. But just at this point Tweed&#x27;s corruption began being revealed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and the new charter was discredited as being planned for more municipal corruption. At this time Hoffman was also considering seriously to run for the presidency in 1872, and Tweed was to be his manager. Tweed, in actuality, had little interest in national affairs (he had been a congressman for a single term in the 1850s), and while he might have considered the possible corruption pickings greater he also was aware of the bad publicity such scandals had brought on the Grant administration. Whoever ran for president in 1872 would face Grant running for re-election. As it turned out, the Tweed scandals wrecked Hoffman&#x27;s chances, and the nomination eventually was split between those Democrats supporting liberal Republican Horace Greeley and those supporting the &quot;pure&quot; Democrat, New York attorney Charles O&#x27;Conor. Hoffman, his reputation ruined by the connections with Tweed, did not seek further political offices.

==Death==
Hoffman died at age 60 in Wiesbaden, Germany on March 24, 1888, while traveling in Europe with family members, as he did each winter. He was buried at Dale Cemetery in Ossining.

==Legacy==
*Hoffman Island is named for him.

<text>The Armenia national football team () represents Armenia in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Football Federation of Armenia, the governing body for football in Armenia.

After gaining independence from the Soviet Union, the team played its first international match on 12 October 1992. The national team has participated in the qualification of every major tournament from the UEFA Euro 1996 onwards, though they are yet to qualify for the final stages of either a UEFA European Football Championship or a FIFA World Cup. The team&#x27;s main achievements have been third-place finish in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying stage, and being promoted to the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League B.

The primary training ground is at the Technical Center-Academy of the Football Federation of Armenia in the northern Avan District of the capital Yerevan, and the team plays their home matches at the Republican Stadium.

==History==
Oldest records of football teams in Soviet Armenia goes back to 1926–1927, when the Trans-Caucasian Championship was organized in Tbilisi. Three South Caucasian countries participated: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.

Armenia became an independent state in 1991, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic having previously played for the Soviet Union national football team. The Football Federation of Armenia was founded on 18 January 1992 and established relations with FIFA in 1992 and with UEFA in 1993. The history of the Armenia national team began on 14 October 1992, when Armenia played its first match against Moldova. That meeting ended in a goalless draw. Since 1996, the team has been a member of qualifiers European and World Championships. Armenia has competed in every UEFA European Championship qualifying and FIFA World Cup qualification since 1994.

The first head coach of the Armenian national squad was Soviet Armenian football star Eduard Markarov. Armenian winner of the UEFA Jubilee Awards and fellow Soviet Armenian football great Khoren Oganesian also became a head coach. Many of the early coaches of the national team never stayed for longer than two years. Scottish coach Ian Porterfield became head coach in 2006 and began to lead the team to some of its first international successes. Under his leadership, the Armenian team played a series of great matches with victories over Kazakhstan 2–1, Poland 1–0 and a draw with Portugal (1–1), with Cristiano Ronaldo in the lineup. But then tragedy struck; the 62-year-old Porterfield died of cancer, leaving his work unfinished. An acting assistant coach, Vardan Minasyan, became acting head coach following Porterfield&#x27;s death. Minasyan learned much from Porterfield and Samvel Darbinyan, another former head coach of Armenia, during this time about coaching and managing. On 10 February 2009, after the draw for the qualifying round teams of the UEFA Euro 2012, by order of the President of the Football Federation of Armenia Ruben Hayrapetyan, Minasyan continued to lead the Armenian national squad, only now as the official head coach.

In the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches, Minasyan led Armenia in Group B against Russia, Slovakia, Ireland, Macedonia and Andorra. Armenia, considered a heavy underdog, defeated the group favorite Slovakia with two crushing defeats 4–0 and 3–1, defeated Andorra in two matches as well 4–0 and 3–0, drew with Macedonia 2–2 and defeated them in the deciding match 4–1 and tied with the group winners Russia 0–0. The Armenian team scored the most goals out of Group B, with a total of 22. Henrikh Mkhitaryan of Armenia scored 6 goals, the most goals scored by a single player in Group B. The national team almost made the final draw, but controversially lost in a decisive match against Ireland 1–2. Armenian goalkeeper Roman Berezovsky was given a red card by Spanish referee Eduardo Gonzalez in the 26th-minute for supposedly touching the ball outside the goal area. However, replays clearly showed the ball touched his chest and never touched his hands. Replays also showed that Ireland striker Simon Cox had actually touched the ball with his right hand. Despite this, Gonzalez did not penalize Cox, who would later admit he touched the ball with his hand. Had Cox&#x27;s offence been punished, Armenia would have been awarded a free-kick. Edgar Malakyan was swapped for replacement goalkeeper Arsen Petrosyan. Valeri Aleksanyan later accidentally scored an own goal past Petrosyan, which ended up deciding the match. Armenia and Ireland would each score another goal. The Football Federation of Armenia unsuccessfully filed a protest over the match. Gonzalez had later resigned after the match. Despite not getting to play in the UEFA Euro 2012, Minasyan brought the Armenia national team to a record #41 FIFA ranking, placed the team in a personal best third place in the group stage and went on to become the longest leading head coach of the Armenia football team. Minasyan stated he was proud of the entire team. They were all welcomed in the airport back in Armenia as heroes.

After the incredible UEFA Euro 2012 run, the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016 qualifiers were not successful, with the Armenian side stood near bottom in the 2014 World Cup run and even finished last without a single win in Euro 2016 campaign. Armenia salvaged some few pride in 2018 World Cup qualification when the Armenians managed to create a shocking 3–2 home win over Montenegro, which contributed to Montenegro&#x27;s failure to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. After these disappointments, Vardan Minasyan returned to lead Armenia in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League D, but finished behind Macedonia, including a humiliating 0–1 home loss to Gibraltar. Due to this humiliation, Minasyan was sacked and Armen Gyulbudaghyants was appointed new coach of Armenian side. The Armenians participated in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying along with giants Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, former European champions Greece, Finland and Liechtenstein. Armenia lost two opening fixtures to Bosnia 1–2 away and Finland 0–2 at home, and was supposed to get eliminated pretty early. However, Armenia began their resurgence following these losses, with a convincing 3–0 home cruise to Liechtenstein before managed to create a shocking 3–2 away win over Greece, former UEFA Euro 2004 champions. Armenia suffered a minor setback after losing at home to powerhouse Italy 1–3, before created another shock in their qualification with a 4–2 convincing win over Bosnia and Herzegovina in the same ground. Armenia was pulled back to the ground when they faced Greece, Finland and Italy in their games, with Armenia defeated in both games and eventually finished fifth in their group, failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 2020.

Armenia participated in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League C and was seen as a minnow in a group containing strong North Macedonia and Georgia, along with fellow minnow Estonia. Armenia began with a 1–2 loss to North Macedonia away, before bounded back with an encouraging 2–0 home win to Estonia in September 2020. In October, Armenia had to play their designated &quot;home game&quot; away from their country in Poland due to 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War, and disappointed with only a 2–2 draw to Georgia and 1–1 draw to Estonia, thus leaving impression that Armenia would flounder from the chance to get promotion. Yet, in November the same year, despite having to play away from home, and without their talisman and captain Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Armenia managed what would be the country&#x27;s greatest comeback in the history, beating Georgia right in Tbilisi 2–1 before stunned the Fyromians, who had qualified for Euro 2020, 1–0, in their designated home game in Cyprus. These wins had not just ensured Armenia&#x27;s promotion to 2022–23 UEFA Nations League B, but it also meant Armenia could be the first Caucasus country to get a FIFA World Cup playoff ticket. Moreover, the League B season in 2022–23 could also ensure Armenia a playoff place for the UEFA Euro 2024.

Armenia participated in the 2022 World Cup qualification and was seen weak to the group containing strong Germany, Iceland, Romania and North Macedonia. Armenia started with a difficult 1–0 win to Liechtenstein away, leaving yet again an impression that Armenia would just end up being mopped by the remainders. However, Armenia stunned both Iceland and Romania on their home fixtures 2–0 and 3–2 to top the group for the first time ever, raising the country&#x27;s hopes of qualifying for an improbable maiden World Cup. Ultimately however, Armenia&#x27;s campaign ended in bitter disappointment as they failed to win a single one of their remaining seven qualifying games, finding themselves on the end of a 6-0 trashing by Germany and even being held to a 1–1 draw at home by lowly Liechtenstein. Armenia finished a distant fourth place in the group, ahead of Liechtenstein and an underwhelming Iceland side but six points behind playoff-bound North Macedonia and even five points behind third-placed Romania.

==Stadium==
Hrazdan Stadium was built from 1969 to 1970 on Athens St., Kentron in a period of 18 months with the financial support of the oil magnate Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. A total amount of 5 million rubles was allocated for Hrazdan. The stadium was named after the slope of the Hrazdan River. It is the largest stadium in Armenia, with more than 70,000 seats. The opening of the stadium took place on 29 November 1970. The Armenia national team played home matches in Hrazdan until 2000. Several Armenian football clubs also played in Hrazdan. In Soviet times, it was one of the largest stadiums in the Soviet Union (among the top four) and one of the few double-tiered stadiums. Hrazdan was the football ground stadium for Ararat Yerevan. Hrazdan Stadium hosted its first official football match on 19 May 1971 when Ararat Yerevan defeated Kairat 3–0 in front of a record 78,000 spectators. The stadium would host Ararat Yerevan for the final victory of the club in the 1973 Soviet Top League and in the 1973 and 1975 Soviet Cup. The Soviet Union national football team played only two matches at the stadium, both of which date back to 1978. In April of that year, in a friendly game against Finland, the USSR won 10–2. Six months later, in a qualifying match for the UEFA Euro 1980 against Greece the Soviet team won again 2–0. The match with Finland hosted 12,000 spectators and the match with Greece hosted 40,000. The capacity of the stadium decreased from 70,000 to an all-seater of 53,849 spectators. By the second half of 2012, Hrazdan was completely renovated to become the regular venue of the national team&#x27;s home matches.

The Republican Stadium was renovated in 1999 and, since 2000, has been the home ground for Armenia. The stadium was built in 1953 and finished within a year&#x27;s time. Republican Stadium has a capacity of 14,968. During the Soviet period and onward from 1953 to 1999, it was known as Dinamo Stadium. The stadium had its official name changed to &quot;Republican Stadium named after Vazgen Sargsyan&quot; in 1999, after Armenian war hero and former Prime Minister of Armenia Vazgen Sargsyan, who died that year. Local clubs Pyunik and Ulisses play home matches at the Republican Stadium. In 2008, the stadium went under a large-scale development in order to modernize the playing surface and to create a high level VIP section and other facilities which met UEFA standards.

Armenia played a match in Hrazdan in 2008 against Turkey after partial renovation earlier that year. The number of seats decreased from 75,000 to 53,849. It is planned to hold Armenia&#x27;s home matches after a complete renovation in 2012. On 12 October 2012, Armenia played a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Italy, but has not used Hrazdan since. Hrazdan is used mostly for Armenian football clubs and a number of other athletic competitions.

===Jerseys and colour===
The home gear color were previously the Red-Blue-Orange Armenian tricolour, designed by Stepan Malkhasyants. All three colors were on the first Armenia national team jerseys issued. The definition of the colors, as stated in government website, is:

:The Red emblematizes the Armenian Highland, the Armenian people&#x27;s continued struggle for survival, maintenance of the Orthodox Christian faith, Armenia&#x27;s independence and freedom. The Blue emblematizes the will of the people of Armenia to live beneath peaceful skies. The Orange emblematizes the creative talent and hard-working nature of the people of Armenia.

In the Euro 2012 qualification matches, played in 2010 and 2011, Armenia&#x27;s home colors were red-blue-red, produced by Hummel. Beginning with the May 2012 friendly with Greece, Armenia switched to all-red home colours and an all-white away kit produced by Adidas.

<doc id="695295" wikidata="Q722732" url="?curid=695295" title="Litomyšl">
<text>Litomyšl (; ) is a town in Svitavy District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 10,000 inhabitants. It is a former bishopric and Latin Catholic titular see. Litomyšl is known for the château-type castle complex of the Litomyšl Castle, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The historic town centre with the castle complex is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Litomyšl consists of ten municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Litomyšl-město (6,026)
*Kornice (137)
*Lány (441)
*Nedošín (526)
*Nová Ves u Litomyšle (99)
*Pazucha (130)
*Pohodlí (290)
*Suchá (101)
*Zahájí (1,147)
*Záhradí (1,130)
Nová Ves u Litomyšle and Pohodlí form an exclave of the municipal territory.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the personal name Litomysl (in old Czech written as Ľutomysl), meaning &quot;Litomysl&#x27;s (castle)&quot;.

==Geography==
Litomyšl is located about northwest of Svitavy and southeast of Pardubice. It lies in the Svitavy Uplands. The highest point is at above sea level. The Loučná River flows through the town. There are several fishponds in the municipal territory; the largest of them is Velký Košíř, located northwest of the town proper.

==History==

The first written mention of Litomyšl is from 981. It is a record in &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot; mentioning death of Duke Slavník. Litomyšl was originally a protective fortified settlement of the Slavník dynasty principality on a significant trade route from Bohemia to Moravia. In 1259, Litomyšl was promoted to a town by King Ottokar II.

During the following centuries the town was owned by various noble families: Kostka of Postupice, Pernštejn, Trauttmansdorff, Waldstein-Wartemberg and last Thurn und Taxis. The Litomyšl Castle was built in 1568–1581 by the Pernštejns.

From 30 April 1344 till its suppression in 1474 the town was the seat of the Latin Catholic Diocese of Leitomischl until its territory was merged back into the (meanwhile Metropolitan Arch) Diocese of Prague. In 1970 it was nominally restored as titular see.

A congregation of the proto-Protestant brotherhood Unitas Fratrum (Unity of the Brethren) was documented in Litomyšl as early as 1490. The Brethren flourished in Litomyšl, being protected by the Kostka family. The Brethren founded a printing press there. The town, along with Mladá Boleslav, became a major centre for the Brethren. However, after the Catholic emperor emerged victorious from the Schmalkaldic War, bishop Jan Augusta was captured and imprisoned in 1548 and the Brethren were expelled from Litomyšl and many emigrated to Poland and Moravia.

In the 19th century, Litomyšl ceased to be the main economical centre of the region, but remained the cultural and educational centre. Until 1918, the town was a part of Austria-Hungary, head of the district with the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

Existence of the Jewish community is documented at least from the late 16th century. During the Holocaust, in 1942, the last families were deported. Litomyšl had a German-speaking community until it was expelled in 1945 as a result of the Beneš decrees.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The I/35 road (the section from Hradec Králové to Svitavy, part of the European route E442) passes through the town.

Litomyšl is the starting point of the railway line of local importance heading to Choceň. The town is served by three train stations and stops.

==Culture==
Since 1946, the town hosts &quot;Smetanova Litomyšl&quot;, a large annual festival of classical music. It bears the name of the composer Bedřich Smetana, who is the most famous local native.

There is an extensive permanent exhibition of Olbram Zoubek&#x27;s sculptures and art in Litomyšl Castle Vault Gallery.

===Language===
Until the late 19th century, the Litomyšl area had its own unique variety of the Czech language. This variety, named &quot;Teták&quot; by linguist Henning Andersen (after its word for &quot;five&quot;, /tet/, as opposed to Standard Czech &quot;pět&quot; /pjet/), underwent an unusual sound change: bilabial consonants (/p/, /b/, /m/) became alveolars (/t/, /d/, /n/) before front vowels. Examples are /tekɲe/ (&#x27;nicely&#x27;; Standard Czech &quot;pěkně&quot;), /diːlej/ (&#x27;white&#x27;; Standard Czech &quot;bílý&quot;) and /nesto/ (&#x27;town&#x27;; Standard Czech &quot;město&quot;).

==Sights==

The main landmark of Litomyšl is the Litomyšl Castle, one of the largest Renaissance castles. The buildings of the castle precincts are exceptional for their architectural refinement. The castle complex also includes the birthplace of Bedřich Smetana, carriage house, stables, riding school, castle brewery, castle park and French-style garden. The castle complex was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999.

Neyt to the castle is the Piarist college with the seat of members of the order, the Church of the Finding the Holy Cross and adjacent monastery gardens. Today the gardens serve as a town park. The gardens include sculptures by Olbram Zoubek.

On the elongated square, which is almost long and one of the largest in Central Europe, is a town hall of Gothic origin and series of Renaissance and Baroque houses, many with arcades and vaulted ground floor rooms. One of the most significant burgher houses is the house &quot;U Rytířů&quot; (&quot;At the Knights&quot;), a Renaissance house built from 1540 to 1546 with a notable stone façade.

Litomyšl is also home to the &quot;Portmoneum&quot;, a museum of the artist and writer Josef Váchal in the home of his admirer Josef Portman, who commissioned Váchal&#x27;s murals and painted furniture in the house.

<text>Tim Berne (born October 16, 1954) is an American avant-garde jazz saxophonist and record label owner. His primary instruments are the alto and baritone saxophones.

==Biography==

Berne was born in Syracuse, New York, United States. He has said that he had no interest in playing an instrument until he attended Lewis &amp; Clark College in Oregon. Hearing the album &quot;Dogon A.D.&quot; (1972) by Julius Hemphill turned his attention toward jazz. He was a fan of rhythm and blues, and it seemed to him that Hemphill was playing jazz with the soulfulness of R&amp;B. In 1974, he went to New York to find Hemphill, who gave him saxophone lessons and advice on how to manage his career. Berne started the record label Empire in 1979.

For Empire, he recorded four albums with avant-garde jazz musicians such as John Carter, Alex Cline, Nels Cline, Olu Dara, Vinny Golia, Paul Motian, and Ed Schuller. His next two albums appeared on Soul Note in the early 1980s. In these sessions he worked with Motian, Schuller, Ray Anderson, Herb Robertson and others. He then got a contract with Columbia and recorded with Robertson, Hank Roberts, Bill Frisell and others. During this time he also recorded a duo album with Frisell and two albums with John Zorn. After two albums with Columbia, he signed with JMT, a label known for avant-garde jazz. 

In the 1990s, he recorded in the trio, Miniature, with Roberts and Joey Baron, and in the band Caos Totale with Django Bates, Mark Dresser, Marc Ducret, Steve Swell, and Bobby Previte. He led a trio with Michael Formanek and Jim Black, then added Chris Speed to form the quartet Bloodcount (which was occasionally a quintet with the addition of Ducret). PolyGram bought JMT and closed it. This motivated Berne to start Screwgun Records as the outlet for his albums.

Screwgun&#x27;s first release was a 3-disc set by Bloodcount called &quot;Unwound&quot;, the music of which exemplified Berne&#x27;s characteristic style of &quot;explod[ing] the walls of traditional compositional form: instead of adhering to anything remotely resembling theme and variations, he intersperses thematic material–sometimes repeated, elongated, or truncated–with the careening pleasures of free improvisation.&quot; During the late 1990s he continued to perform with Bloodcount, formed Paraphrase, a trio with Drew Gress and Tom Rainey, and Big Satan, a trio with Ducret and Rainey.

In the early 2000s, Berne formed several groups, including the trio Hard Cell with Rainey and Craig Taborn, and the quartet Science Friction (Berne, Ducret, Rainey,and Taborn). He also collaborated with members of The Bad Plus for the project Buffalo Collision, with Nels Cline of Wilco for the critically acclaimed album &quot;The Veil&quot; in 2011, and with David Torn on several projects and recordings.

Berne formed the band &quot;Snakeoil&quot; with Matt Mitchell, Oscar Noriega, and Ches Smith, which released a self-titled album in 2012, and six more recordings, with slight personnel changes, over the next decade. During this time, he has also recorded with members of The Bad Plus as Broken Shadows, and in duos with several musicians. In 2023 he released &quot;Oceans And&quot; with Hank Roberts and Aurora Nealand.

Recently albums by other musicians interpreting Berne&#x27;s music have begun to appear. These include &quot;Førage&quot; by Matt Mitchell, &quot;Koi&quot; by Gregg Belisle-Chi, and &quot;Palm Sweat&quot; by Marc Ducret.

<text>Screwgun Records is a jazz record label founded by saxophonist Tim Berne in 1996. Most releases on the label have been by Berne, though some have been by Berne&#x27;s associates and bandmates. Steve Byram has designed and illustrated the artwork for many of the label&#x27;s albums.

After attending college in Oregon, Berne moved to New York City in the 1970s to meet saxophonist Julius Hemphill, whose music had inspired him to become a jazz musician. Hemphill became his mentor, giving him saxophone lessons and helping him find his way in the music business. Berne founded Empire Records in the late 1970s to issue own albums. He released five albums, and his work was noticed by Giovanni Bonandrini, an Italian producer who issued Berne&#x27;s next two albums on Soul Note. Berne signed with Columbia Records in the 1980s, then recorded for JMT Records until it shut down in 1995. Then Berne founded Screwgun to get control of his work again. Screwgun albums were initially distinguished by their brown, cardboard covers decorated with the line drawings of Steve Byram. The unorthodox artwork fit Berne&#x27;s unorthodox music and business tactics.

<text>The Bartered Bride (, &quot;The Sold Bride&quot;) is a comic opera in three acts by the Czech composer Bedřich Smetana, to a libretto by Karel Sabina. The work is generally regarded as a major contribution towards the development of Czech music. It was composed during the period 1863 to 1866, and first performed at the Provisional Theatre, Prague, on 30 May 1866 in a two-act format with spoken dialogue. Set in a country village and with realistic characters, it tells the story of how, after a late surprise revelation, true love prevails over the combined efforts of ambitious parents and a scheming marriage broker.

The opera was not immediately successful, and was revised and extended in the following four years. In its final version, premiered in 1870, it rapidly gained popularity and eventually became a worldwide success. Until this time, the Czech national opera had only been represented by minor, rarely performed works. This opera, Smetana&#x27;s second, was part of his quest to create a truly Czech operatic genre. Smetana&#x27;s musical treatment made considerable use of traditional Bohemian dance forms, such as the polka and furiant, and, although he largely avoided the direct quotation of folksong, he nevertheless created music considered by Czechs to be quintessentially Czech in spirit. The overture, often played as a concert piece independently from the opera, was, unusually, composed before almost any of the other music had been written. 

After a performance at the Vienna Music and Theatre Exhibition of 1892, the opera achieved international recognition. It was performed in Chicago in 1893, London in 1895 and reached New York in 1909, subsequently becoming the first, and for many years the only, Czech opera in the general repertory. Many of these early international performances were in German, under the title &quot;Die verkaufte Braut&quot;, and the German-language version continues to be played and recorded. A German film of the opera was made in 1932 by Max Ophüls.

== Context ==

Until the middle 1850s Bedřich Smetana was known in Prague principally as a teacher, pianist and composer of salon pieces. His failure to achieve wider recognition in the Bohemian capital led him to depart in 1856 for Sweden, where he spent the next five years. During this period he extended his compositional range to large-scale orchestral works in the descriptive style championed by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. Liszt was Smetana&#x27;s long-time mentor; he had accepted a dedication of the latter&#x27;s Opus 1: &quot;Six Characteristic Pieces for Piano&quot; in 1848, and had encouraged the younger composer&#x27;s career since then. In September 1857 Smetana visited Liszt in Weimar, where he met Peter Cornelius, a follower of Liszt&#x27;s who was working on a comic opera, &quot;Der Barbier von Bagdad&quot;. Their discussions centred on the need to create a modern style of comic opera, as a counterbalance to Wagner&#x27;s new form of music drama. A comment was made by the Viennese conductor Johann von Herbeck to the effect that Czechs were incapable of making music of their own, a remark which Smetana took to heart: &quot;I swore there and then that no other than I should beget a native Czech music.&quot;

Smetana did not act immediately on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending the building of a permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861. He was then spurred to creative action by the announcement of a prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written &quot;The Brandenburgers in Bohemia&quot; to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet Karel Sabina, whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848. &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot;, which was awarded the opera prize, was a serious historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius&#x27;s &quot;Der Barbier&quot;, and was ready to try his own hand at the comic genre.

==Composition history==

=== Libretto ===

For his libretto, Smetana again approached Sabina, who by 5 July 1863 had produced an untitled one-act sketch in German. Over the following months Sabina was encouraged to develop this into a full-length text, and to provide a Czech translation. According to Smetana&#x27;s biographer Brian Large, this process was prolonged and untidy; the manuscript shows amendments and additions in Smetana&#x27;s own hand, and some pages apparently written by Smetana&#x27;s wife Bettina (who may have been receiving dictation). By the end of 1863 a two-act version, with around 20 musical numbers separated by spoken dialogue, had been assembled. Smetana&#x27;s diary indicates that he, rather than Sabina, chose the work&#x27;s title because &quot;the poet did not know what to call it.&quot; The translation &quot;Sold Bride&quot; is strictly accurate, but the more euphonious &quot;Bartered Bride&quot; has been adopted throughout the English-speaking world. Sabina evidently did not fully appreciate Smetana&#x27;s intention to write a full-length opera, later commenting: &quot;If I had suspected what Smetana would make of my operetta, I should have taken more pains and written him a better and more solid libretto.&quot;
The Czech music specialist John Tyrrell has observed that, despite the casual way in which &quot;The Bartered Bride&#x27;s&quot; libretto was put together, it has an intrinsic &quot;Czechness&quot;, being one of the few in Czech written in trochees (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one), matching the natural first-syllable emphasis in Czech.

=== Composition ===
By October 1862, well before the arrival of any libretto or plot sketch, Smetana had noted down 16 bars which later became the theme of &quot;The Bartered Bride&#x27;s&quot; opening chorus. In May 1863 he sketched eight bars which he eventually used in the love duet &quot;Faithful love can&#x27;t be marred&quot;, and later that summer, while still awaiting Sabina&#x27;s revised libretto, he wrote the theme of the comic number &quot;We&#x27;ll make a pretty little thing&quot;. He also produced a piano version of the entire overture, which was performed in a public concert on 18 November. In this, he departed from his normal practice of leaving the overture until last.

The opera continued to be composed in a piecemeal fashion, as Sabina&#x27;s libretto gradually took shape. Progress was slow, and was interrupted by other work. Smetana had become Chorus Master of the Hlahol Choral Society in 1862, and spent much time rehearsing and performing with the Society. He was deeply involved in the 1864 Shakespeare Festival in Prague, conducting Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Romeo et Juliette&quot; and composing a festival march. That same year he became music correspondent of the Czech-language newspaper &quot;Národní listy&quot;. Smetana&#x27;s diary for December 1864 records that he was continuing to work on &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;; the piano score was completed by October 1865. It was then put aside so that the composer could concentrate on his third opera &quot;Dalibor&quot;. Smetana evidently did not begin the orchestral scoring of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; until, following the successful performance of &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot; in January 1866, the management of the Provisional Theatre decided to stage the new opera during the following summer. The scoring was completed rapidly, between 20 February and 16 March.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

A crowd of villagers is celebrating at the church fair (&quot;Let&#x27;s rejoice and be merry&quot;). Among them are Mařenka and Jeník. Mařenka is unhappy because her parents want her to marry someone she has never met. They will try to force her into this, she says. Her desires are for Jeník even though, as she explains in her aria &quot;If I should ever learn&quot;, she knows nothing of his background. The couple then declare their feelings for each other in a passionate love duet (&quot;Faithful love can&#x27;t be marred&quot;).

As the pair leave separately, Mařenka&#x27;s parents, Ludmila and Krušina, enter with the marriage broker Kecal. After some discussion, Kecal announces that he has found a groom for Mařenka – Vašek, younger son of Tobiáš Mícha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing. Kecal extols the virtues of Vašek (&quot;He&#x27;s a nice boy, well brought up&quot;), as Mařenka re-enters. In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that she already has a chosen lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four argue, but little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jeník to give up Mařenka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.

===Act 2===
The men of the village join in a rousing drinking song (&quot;To beer!&quot;), while Jeník and Kecal argue the merits, respectively, of love and money over beer. The women enter, and the whole group joins in dancing a furiant. Away from the jollity the nervous Vašek muses over his forthcoming marriage in a stuttering song (&quot;My-my-my mother said to me&quot;). Mařenka appears, and guesses immediately who he is, but does not reveal her own identity. Pretending to be someone else, she paints a picture of &quot;Mařenka&quot; as a treacherous deceiver. Vašek is easily fooled, and when Mařenka, in her false guise, pretends to woo him (&quot;I know of a maiden fair&quot;), he falls for her charms and swears to give Mařenka up.
Meanwhile, Kecal is attempting to buy Jeník off, and after some verbal fencing makes a straight cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300 florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha&#x27;s son will be allowed to wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved (&quot;When you discover whom you&#x27;ve bought&quot;), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.

Kecal summons the villagers to witness the contract he has made (&quot;Come inside and listen to me&quot;). He reads the terms: Mařenka is to marry no one but Mícha&#x27;s son. Krušina and the crowd marvel at Jeník&#x27;s apparent self-denial, but the mood changes when they learn that he has been paid off. The act ends with Jenik being denounced by Krušina and the rest of the assembly as a rascal.

===Act 3===
Vašek expresses his confusions in a short, sad song (&quot;I can&#x27;t get it out of my head&quot;), but is interrupted by the arrival of a travelling circus. The Ringmaster introduces the star attractions: Esmeralda, the Spanish dancer, a &quot;real Indian&quot; sword swallower, and a dancing bear. A rapid folk-dance, the skočná, follows. Vašek is entranced by Esmeralda, but his timid advances are interrupted when the &quot;Indian&quot; rushes in, announcing that the &quot;bear&quot; has collapsed in a drunken stupor. A replacement is required. Vašek is soon persuaded to take the job, egged on by Esmeralda&#x27;s flattering words (&quot;We&#x27;ll make a pretty thing out of you&quot;).
The circus folk leave. Vašek&#x27;s parents – Mícha and Háta – arrive, with Kecal. Vašek tells them that he no longer wants to marry Mařenka, having learned her true nature from a beautiful, strange girl. They are horrified (&quot;He does not want her – what has happened?&quot;). Vašek runs off, and moments later Mařenka arrives with her parents. She has just learned of Jeník&#x27;s deal with Kecal, and a lively ensemble (&quot;No, no, I don&#x27;t believe it&quot;) ensues. Matters are further complicated when Vašek returns, recognises Mařenka as his &quot;strange girl&quot;, and says that he will happily marry her. In the sextet which follows (&quot;Make your mind up, Mařenka&quot;), Mařenka is urged to think things over. They all depart, leaving her alone.

In her aria (&quot;Oh what grief&quot;), Mařenka sings of her betrayal. When Jeník appears, she rebuffs him angrily, and declares that she will marry Vašek. Kecal arrives, and is amused by Jeník&#x27;s attempts to pacify Mařenka, who orders her former lover to go. The villagers then enter, with both sets of parents, wanting to know Mařenka&#x27;s decision (&quot;What have you decided, Mařenka?&quot;). As she confirms that she will marry Vašek, Jeník returns, and to great consternation addresses Mícha as &quot;father&quot;. In a surprise identity revelation it emerges that Jeník is Mícha&#x27;s elder son, by a former marriage – the &quot;worthless good-for-nothing&quot; earlier dismissed by Kecal – who had in fact been driven away by his jealous stepmother, Háta. As Mícha&#x27;s son he is, by the terms of the contract, entitled to marry Mařenka; when this becomes clear, Mařenka understands his actions and embraces him. Offstage shouting interrupts the proceedings; it seems that a bear has escaped from the circus and is heading for the village. This creature appears, but is soon revealed to be Vašek in the bear&#x27;s costume (&quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid!&quot;). His antics convince his parents that he is unready for marriage, and he is marched away. Mícha then blesses the marriage between Mařenka and Jeník, and all ends in a celebratory chorus.

==Reception and performance history==

===Premiere===
The premiere of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; took place at the Provisional Theatre on 30 May 1866. Smetana conducted; the stage designs were by Josef Macourek and Josef Jiři Kolár produced the opera. The role of Mařenka was sung by the theatre&#x27;s principal soprano, Eleonora von Ehrenberg – who had refused to appear in &quot;The Brandenburgers&quot; because she thought her proffered role was beneath her. The parts of Krušina, Jeník and Kecal were all taken by leading members of the &quot;Brandenburgers&quot; cast. A celebrated actor, Jindřich Mošna, was engaged to play the Ringmaster, a role which involves little singing skill.

The choice of date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed with a public holiday, and many people had left the city for the country. It was an intensely hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana&#x27;s fee from his own pocket.

Smetana&#x27;s friend Josef Srb-Debrnov, who was unable to attend the performance himself, canvassed opinion from members of the audience as they emerged. &quot;One praised it, another shook his head, and one well-known musician ... said to me: &#x27;That&#x27;s no comic opera; it won&#x27;t do. The opening chorus is fine but I don&#x27;t care for the rest.&#x27;&quot; Josef Krejčí, a member of the panel that had judged Harrach&#x27;s opera competition, called the work a failure &quot;that would never hold its own.&quot;
Press comment was less critical; nevertheless, after one more performance the opera was withdrawn. Shortly afterwards the Provisional Theatre temporarily closed its doors, as the threat of war drew closer to Prague.

=== Restructure ===
Smetana began revising &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; as soon as its first performances were complete. For its first revival, in October 1866, the only significant musical alteration was the addition of a gypsy dance near the start of act 2. For this, Smetana used the music of a dance from &quot;The Brandenburgers of Bohemia&quot;. When &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; returned to the Provisional Theatre in January 1869, this dance was removed, and replaced with a polka. A new scene, with a drinking song for the chorus, was added to act 1, and Mařenka&#x27;s act 2 aria &quot;Oh what grief!&quot; was extended.

So far, changes to the original had been of a minor nature, but when the opera reappeared in June 1869 it had been entirely restructured. Although the musical numbers were still linked by dialogue, the first act had been divided in two, to create a three-act opera. Various numbers, including the drinking song and the new polka, were repositioned, and the polka was now followed by a furiant. A &quot;March of the Comedians&quot; was added, to introduce the strolling players in what was now act 3. A short duet for Esmeralda and the Principal Comedian was dropped. In September 1870 &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; reached its final form, when all the dialogue was replaced by recitative. Smetana&#x27;s own opinion of the finished work, given much later, was largely dismissive: he described it as &quot;a toy ... composing it was mere child&#x27;s play&quot;. It was written, he said &quot;to spite those who accused me of being Wagnerian and incapable of doing anything in a lighter vein.&quot;

===Later performances===
In February 1869 Smetana had the text translated into French, and sent the libretto and score to the Paris Opera with a business proposal for dividing the profits. The management of the Paris Opera did not respond. The opera was first performed outside its native land on 11 January 1871, when Eduard Nápravník, conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, gave a performance at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg. The work attracted mediocre notices from the critics, one of whom compared the work unfavourably to the Offenbach genre. Smetana was hurt by this remark, which he felt downgraded his opera to operetta status, and was convinced that press hostility had been generated by a former adversary, the Russian composer Mily Balakirev. The pair had clashed some years earlier, over the Provisional Theatre&#x27;s stagings of Glinka&#x27;s &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot; and &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;. Smetana believed that Balakirev had used the Russian premiere of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; as a means of exacting revenge.

&quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; was not performed abroad again until after Smetana&#x27;s death in 1884. It was staged by the Prague National Theatre company in Vienna, as part of the Vienna Music and Theatre Exhibition of 1892, where its favourable reception was the beginning of its worldwide popularity among opera audiences. Since Czech was not widely spoken, international performances tended to be in German. The United States premiere took place at the Haymarket Theatre, Chicago, on 20 August 1893. The opera was introduced to the Hamburg State Opera in 1894 by Gustav Mahler, then serving as its director; in 1895 the Coburg Company brought its production to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. In 1897, after his appointment as director of the Vienna State Opera, Mahler brought &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; into the Vienna repertory, and conducted regular performances of the work between 1899 and 1907. Mahler&#x27;s enthusiasm for the work was such that he had incorporated a quote from the overture into the final movement of his First Symphony (1888). When he became Director of the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1907 he added the opera to its repertory. The New York premiere, again in German, took place on 19 February 1909, and was warmly received. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented on the excellence of the staging and musical characterisations, and paid particular tribute to &quot;Mr. Mahler&quot;, whose master hand was in evidence throughout. Mahler chose to play the overture between acts 1 and 2, so that latecomers might hear it.

===Modern revivals===
The opera was performed more than one hundred times during Smetana&#x27;s lifetime (the first Czech opera to reach this landmark), subsequently becoming a permanent feature of the National Theatre&#x27;s repertory. On 9 May 1945 a special performance in memory of the victims of World War II was given at the theatre, four days after the last significant fighting in Europe.

In the years since its American premiere &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; has entered the repertory of all major opera companies, and is regularly revived worldwide. After several unsuccessful attempts to stage it in France, it was premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in 1928, sung in French as &quot;La Fiancée vendue&quot;. In 2008 the opera was added to the repertoire of the Paris Opera, in a new production staged at the Palais Garnier.

In the English-speaking world, recent productions of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; in London have included the Royal Opera House (ROH) presentation in 1998, staged at Sadler&#x27;s Wells during the restoration of the ROH&#x27;s headquarters at Covent Garden. This production in English was directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by Bernard Haitink; it was criticised both for its stark settings and for ruining the act 2 entrance of Vašek. It was nevertheless twice revived by the ROH – in 2001 and 2006, under Charles Mackerras.

A New York Metropolitan staging was in 1996 under James Levine, a revival of John Dexter&#x27;s 1978 production with stage designs by Josef Svoboda. In 2005 &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; returned to New York, at the Juilliard School theatre, in a new production by Eve Shapiro, conducted by Mark Stringer. In its May 2009 production at the Cutler Majestic Theatre, Opera Boston transplanted the action to 1934, in the small Iowan town of Spillville, once the home of a large Czech settlement.

==Music==
Although much of the music of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; is folk-like, the only significant use of authentic folk material is in the act 2 furiant, with a few other occasional glimpses of basic Czech folk melodies. The &quot;Czechness&quot; of the music is further illustrated by the closeness to Czech dance rhythms of many individual numbers. Smetana&#x27;s diary indicates that he was trying to give the music &quot;a popular character, because the plot [...] is taken from village life and demands a national treatment.&quot; According to his biographer John Clapham, Smetana &quot;certainly felt the pulse of the peasantry and knew how to express this in music, yet inevitably he added something of himself.&quot; Historian Harold Schonberg argues that &quot;the exoticisms of the Bohemian musical language were not in the Western musical consciousness until Smetana appeared.&quot; Smetana&#x27;s musical language is, on the whole, one of happiness, expressing joy, dancing and festivals.

The mood of the entire opera is set by the overture, a concert piece in its own right, which Tyrrell describes as &quot;a tour de force of the genre, wonderfully spirited &amp; wonderfully crafted.&quot; Tyrrell draws attention to several of its striking features – its extended string fugato, climactic tutti and prominent syncopations. The overture does not contain many of the opera&#x27;s later themes: biographer Brian Large compares it to Mozart&#x27;s overtures to &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, in establishing a general mood. It is followed immediately by an extended orchestral prelude, for which Smetana adapted part of his 1849 piano work &quot;Wedding Scenes&quot;, adding special effects such as bagpipe imitations.

Schonberg has suggested that Bohemian composers express melancholy in a delicate, elegiac manner &quot;without the crushing world-weariness and pessimism of the Russians.&quot; Thus, Mařenka&#x27;s unhappiness is illustrated in the opening chorus by a brief switch to the minor key; likewise, the inherent pathos of Vašek&#x27;s character is demonstrated by the dark minor key music of his act 3 solo. Smetana also uses the technique of musical reminiscence, where particular themes are used as reminders of other parts of the action; the lilting clarinet theme of &quot;faithful love&quot; is an example, though it and other instances fall short of being full-blown Wagnerian leading themes or &quot;Leitmotifs&quot;.

Large has commented that despite the colour and vigour of the music, there is little by way of characterisation, except in the cases of Kecal and, to a lesser extent, the loving pair and the unfortunate Vašek. The two sets of parents and the various circus folk are all conventional and &quot;penny-plain&quot; figures. In contrast, Kecal&#x27;s character – that of a self-important, pig-headed, loquacious bungler – is instantly established by his rapid-patter music. Large suggests that the character may have been modelled on that of the boastful Baron in Cimarosa&#x27;s opera &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot;. Mařenka&#x27;s temperament is shown in vocal flourishes which include coloratura passages and sustained high notes, while Jeník&#x27;s good nature is reflected in the warmth of his music, generally in the G minor key. For Vašek&#x27;s dual image, comic and pathetic, Smetana uses the major key to depict comedy, the minor for sorrow. Large suggests that Vašek&#x27;s musical stammer, portrayed especially in his opening act 2 song, was taken from Mozart&#x27;s character Don Curzio in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;.

==Film and other adaptations==
A silent film of &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; was made in 1913 by the Czech film production studio Kinofa. It was produced by Max Urban and starred his wife Andula Sedláčková. A German-language version of the opera, &quot;Die verkaufte Braut&quot;, was filmed in 1932 by Max Ophüls, the celebrated German director then at the beginning of his film-making career. The screenplay was drawn from Sabina&#x27;s libretto by Curt Alexander, and Smetana&#x27;s music was adapted by the German composer of film music, Theo Mackeben. The film starred the leading Czech opera singer Jarmila Novotná in the role of Mařenka (&quot;Marie&quot; in the film), and the German baritone Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender as Jeník (&quot;Hans&quot;).

Ophuls constructed an entire Czech village in the studio to provide an authentic background. Following the film&#x27;s US release in 1934, &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that it &quot;carr[ied] most of the comedy of the original&quot; but was &quot;rather weak on the musical side&quot;, despite the presence of stars such as Novotná. Opera-lovers, the review suggested, should not expect too much, but the work nevertheless gave an attractive portrait of Bohemian village life in the mid-19th century. The reviewer found most of the acting first-rate, but commented that &quot;the photography and sound reproduction are none too clear at times.&quot; Other film adaptations of the opera were made in 1922 directed by Oldrich Kminek (Atropos), in 1933, directed by Jaroslav Kvapil, Svatopluk Innemann and Emil Pollert (Espofilm), and in 1976, directed by Václav Kašlík (Barrandov). A version was produced for Australian television in 1960.

<text>Brains (S. A. Brain &amp; Company Ltd.) is a regional brewery based in Cardiff, Wales. It was founded in 1882 by Samuel Arthur Brain. At its peak, the company controlled more than 250 pubs in South Wales (particularly in Cardiff), Mid Wales and the West Country but the brewer sold most of its pub estate in 2022. The company took over Crown Buckley Brewery in Llanelli in 1997 and Hancock&#x27;s Brewery in 1999. In 2000, Brains moved to the former Hancock&#x27;s Brewery just south of Cardiff Central railway station. The Old Brewery, in Cardiff city centre, has been developed into a modern bar and restaurant complex.

The company produces a range of beers under the Brains, Buckley&#x27;s and Hancock&#x27;s names. As part of their marketing strategy, Brains use shirt sponsorship for the Wales national rugby union team and the Crusaders Rugby League team.

==History==

The original brewery, believed to be the oldest in Cardiff, was established by the Thomas brothers in the 18th-century. In 1882 it was acquired by Samuel Arthur Brain, a brewer from Bristol, England, and his uncle Joseph Benjamin Brain, Chairman of the West of England Bank. Part of the building dated from 1713 and it had been a brewery since at least 1822.

In 1882 the brewery produced 100 barrels of beer a week and operated 11 pubs. By 1900 this had grown to 1,000 barrels of beer a week, supplying 80 of their public houses. The company became a limited company, S A Brain &amp; Co Ltd, in April 1897 and purchased the business for £350,000.

Brains expanded the Old Brewery was expanded in 1914 by having a new brewery built in St Mary Street.

In 1997 Brains took over Crown Buckley in Llanelli. It closed Crown Buckley&#x27;s brewery and transferred production to Cardiff. In 1999 Brains bought the former Hancock&#x27;s Brewery just south of Cardiff Central railway station. In 2000 it moved production there, and in 2003 the Old Brewery was redeveloped as a bar and restaurant complex.

Ownerships remains in the Brains family; until 2009 the chairman was Chris Brain, and since that date the company has been led by John Rhys, the great-great-grandson of the company&#x27;s founder Samuel Arthur Brain.

In March 2019 the new Dragon Brewery, at the Pacific Business Park in Tremorfa, was opened by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, who was taken on a tour of the new facility by head brewer Bill Dobson.

In December 2020, Brains handed over the running of its 156 pubs via a 25-year lease-back deal to Marston&#x27;s Ninety-nine Brains pubs were later put up for sale.

In May 2022 it was announced that Brains had sold the freehold and leasehold of 95 of their pubs to Song Capital, with the proceeds used to pay off existing debts.

In December 2023 Brains announced that, following the sale of their pubs, they had recovered from the debt that forced the sale following the pandemic.

===Coffee===
In September 2011 the company diversified into coffee shops, buying the Cardiff-based coffee house chain, Coffee#1. In mid-2018, SA Brain announced that they wished to sell a majority stake in Coffee#1, after a strategic review. In January 2019, Caffè Nero bought a 70% stake in the business, which at that time had 92 outlets.

In February 2022 it was announced that Brains had sold their remaining stake in the business to Caffe Nero.

==Beer brands==
===Brains brand===
Brains SA, the company&#x27;s flagship brand, is a light-coloured malty best bitter which is colloquially known as &quot;Skull Attack&quot;. Its formulation has undergone several revisions since the beer was launched in the early 20th century; the most recent revision was launched in early 2006 and increases the quantity of hops in the brew.

Brains Dark is a dark mild ale with an emphasis on roasted malts. There is also a &#x27;smooth&#x27; variant.

Brains Bitter is the brewery&#x27;s standard bitter and the most commonly available in Cardiff. Many Brains&#x27; pubs serve only bitter from a cask. When served pasteurised and nitrogenated it is termed Brains Smooth.

Brains IPA, an unusually malty example of the India Pale Ale style, is usually seen on cask only in the valleys outside Cardiff, although some pubs stock it as keg beer or in bottles in Cardiff proper.

SA Gold, the newest addition to the line, is – according to a release note sent out to Brains pubs in early 2006 – Brains&#x27; attempts to branch out into both the English and youth markets, areas in which Brains is visibly struggling. Its official launch was June 2006, but many houses retired it in favour of the bi-monthly guest ale rotation. The beer is hopped with Cascade, Target and Styrian Golding hops.

45 was a keg beer at 4.5% ABV. It was launched in 2006 in Cardiff as a competitor to strong lagers such as Stella Artois. In March 2007, the recipe was radically altered from the original used in the January launch after slow market growth and poor in-house response. It was discontinued in 2011.

The Rev. James is a 4.5% ABV dark best bitter carried over from the Buckley&#x27;s range after the two breweries merged.

Brains Black is a 4.1% ABV stout launched on St David&#x27;s Day 2010.

Barry Island IPA originally launched in June 2012 as part of the Brains Craft Brewery range, Barry Island IPA is an American style IPA brewed using a trio of American Hops. In 2019 it got a new look and became part of the core range.

Bayside Lager is a 4.3% lager launched in August 2020. It is a crisp and light lager and currently only available in draught form, although it is available in mini-keg online.

===Buckley&#x27;s brand===
Brains bought the Llanelli-based Crown Buckley in 1998. It continues to brew three Buckley&#x27;s beers, all at its Cardiff brewery: Buckley&#x27;s Bitter, Buckley&#x27;s IPA and Reverend James best bitter.

===Hancock&#x27;s brand===
Hancocks HB is a 3.6% session bitter first brewed by Hancock&#x27;s brewery. Formerly Wales&#x27; biggest brewer, the brewery was founded by William Hancock (father of Frank, Froude and William Hancock) and bought by Bass in 1968. Brains bought Hancock&#x27;s in 1999, but initially Bass kept the rights to the brands. Production later came back to Cardiff.

==Seasonal beers==
Seasonal beers&#x27; include &quot;St David&#x27;s Ale, which is brewed to celebrate St David&#x27;s Day and is available in February and March. Taff End is available in June and July and celebrates sponsorship of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club. Brains&#x27; Bread of Heaven&quot;&#x27;, named after a traditional Welsh rugby anthem, was launched in 2005 in commemoration of the sponsorship, and is mostly sold during the Six Nations Championship and autumn internationals.

Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) was launched in 2006 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Welsh national anthem. It is a golden ale brewed with Welsh honey.

==Marketing==

Brains sponsored a number of railway bridges over roads in Cardiff to have its advertising slogans painted on them. They include &quot;It&#x27;s Brains you want!&quot; in Clare Road and Leckwith Road and &quot;People who know beer... have Brains&quot; in Penarth Road.
Brains was the shirt sponsor for the Wales national rugby union team from 2004 until 2010. As French law forbids alcohol sponsorship logos from appearing on rugby jerseys, when the team played in France the branding was changed. In 2005, &quot;Brains&quot; was replaced with &quot;Brawn&quot;, in 2007 it was changed to &quot;Brawn Again&quot;, and in 2009 it was replaced with &quot;Try Essai&quot;, a pun on the invitation to &quot;try SA&quot;.

==The Old Brewery Quarter==

In 2003, Brains vacant Old Brewery was redeveloped into the &quot;Old Brewery Quarter&quot; .It is a mixed development of of leisure space around an open-air piazza in the heart of Cardiff&#x27;s growing city centre, together with 42 long-leasehold loft style apartments and penthouses.

The development has attracted a range of bar and restaurant operators including Chiquito, La Tasca, Lava Lounge, Nando&#x27;s, Pancake House, Starbucks, Thai Edge and SA Brains own flagship venue, the Yard Bar and Kitchen.

<text>Michael Coren (born 15 January 1959) is a British-Canadian writer and clergyman. A long-time television personality, Coren hosted &quot;The Michael Coren Show&quot; on the Crossroads Television System from 1999 to 2011 before moving to the Sun News Network to host &quot;The Arena with Michael Coren&quot;, from 2011 until the channel&#x27;s demise in early 2015. He has also been a long-time radio personality, particularly on Toronto talk radio station CFRB. Coren is currently a columnist for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;iPolitics&quot;.

He has written more than ten books, including biographies of G. K. Chesterton, H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. His latest books are &quot;Heresy: Ten Lies They Spread About Christianity&quot; (2012), &quot;The Future of Catholicism&quot; (2013), &quot;Hatred: Islam&#x27;s War on Christianity&quot; (2014), &quot;Epiphany: A Christian&#x27;s Change of Heart &amp; Mind over Same-Sex Marriage&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Rebel Christ&quot; (2021).

==Life and career==
Coren was born in Walthamstow, Essex, England, of Jewish heritage, and raised secular. After obtaining a degree in politics from the University of Nottingham, he moved from Britain to Canada in 1987. For several years, he was a columnist for &quot;Frank&quot; and then &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, before he began syndicated columns for the &quot;Financial Post&quot; and Sun Media in 1995. Following his departure from &quot;Frank&quot;, he became a favourite target of that publication, culminating in a spoof ad contest to &quot;deflower&quot; Michael Coren (a nod to &quot;Frank&quot;&#x27;s notorious &quot;Deflower Caroline Mulroney&quot; contest, and a satirical jab at Coren&#x27;s conservative leanings.) Coren had also been a favourite target of &quot;Frank&quot; back in the days before he began writing for them. Coren took exception to being labelled a &quot;literary prostitute&quot; during a 1994 interview.

His career as a broadcaster began in the early 1990s when he co-hosted a political debate segment with Irshad Manji on TVOntario&#x27;s &quot;Studio 2&quot;. In 1995, he began an evening talk show on CFRB. In 1999, Coren briefly moved to Talk 640 for a short stint as its morning man. He returned to CFRB, where he hosted a show from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. weekday nights, and regularly filled in for other hosts until November 2005. Coren was dismissed by CFRB as a result of complaints arising from comments ridiculing the weight of an apparent guest. In fact, the guest was an actor and the segment was scripted. According to CFRB&#x27;s Operations Manager, Steve Kowch, &quot;Pat Holiday, our general manager and myself went through the tape of Monday night&#x27;s show and were shocked ... it was totally out of bounds.&quot; Coren argues that it was a satire comparing in his mind public attitude to third world starvation with North America&#x27;s obsession with slimming and self-indulgence.

Despite this acrimonious termination, Coren made regular talk show appearances on CFRB in July 2006, at the start of the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict, as he happened to be in Israel at the time. As of 22 April 2007, the show expanded from its usual one-hour slot at 7–8 pm to 7–9 pm. In the fall of 2007 he and former Liberal Party of Canada president Stephen LeDrew launched a daily hour-long afternoon show on CFRB called &quot;Two Bald Guys With Strong Opinions&quot; in which the two argue about the issues of the day. After the departure of LeDrew, Coren was joined by Tarek Fatah after several on air auditions by potential replacement co-hosts. Coren was again let go by CFRB along with 12 other staff of the Toronto radio station on 27 August 2009.

On television, Coren hosted the &quot;Michael Coren Show&quot; on the Crossroads Television System until June 2011 when he left to join the Sun News Network where he hosted &quot;The Arena with Michael Coren&quot; weeknights beginning 30 August 2011. Coren also had a newspaper column published every Saturday in the Sun newspaper chain until February 2015. He has been a columnist for the &quot;Western Standard&quot;, &quot;Catholic Insight&quot; and &quot;The Women&#x27;s Post&quot; and has contributed to &quot;National Post&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and several other publications. A self-professed Tottenham Hotspur fan, he has appeared as a guest host on The Score&#x27;s &quot;The Footy Show&quot;.

Following the demise of Sun News Network in February 2015, Coren briefly joined The Rebel Media, an online platform founded by Ezra Levant originally known as The Rebel Media and since renamed to Rebel News, but left the venture after a week.

Following his conversion to Anglicanism, Coren began to publicly embrace socially liberal ideas such as support for same-sex marriage. He stated that it negatively affected his career and that he became the target of personal attacks from former readers, observing that &quot;there is none so angry as a fundamentalist scorned&quot;. In a 2015 interview Coren estimated that he lost $35,000 a year in income from lost speaking fees and his former recurring columns for Sun Media newspapers, Crossroads Christian Communications properties, &quot;The Catholic Register&quot;, and other conservative Christian publications. He also stated that contrition is a major aspect of his conversion and he regrets &quot;so much of what [he] said, especially the tone&quot; in his earlier career. Coren was ordained a transitional deacon in the Anglican Diocese of Niagara on 20 October 2019.

Coren is also a public speaker, particularly at religious gatherings.

==Controversies==
===AIDS and sexuality===
In the 1990s and 2000s, Coren was alleged to have spoken objectionably about people with AIDS. In 1994, the &quot;Ryerson Review of Journalism&quot; reported Coren&#x27;s response to an interview question about the disease:

&quot;What I do is attack something like a double standard on AIDS. Sure, we must find a cure for AIDS, we must put enormous amounts of money into it...” he pauses. &quot;Look, people are dying all over. When it was blacks in Africa dying of AIDS, no one gave a toss. Nobody gave a toss. Suddenly, it&#x27;s middle-class men in California and everyone goes crazy about it. It&#x27;s a double standard. I&#x27;m trying to provoke people into rethinking comfortable points of view&quot;.

In 2006, Coren wrote a franker newspaper piece in &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, questioning &quot;Why is AIDS so special?&quot;:
At its most simple, stop fornicating. There, I&#x27;ve said it. One of the things that can end a career in North American media. Yet it&#x27;s true. AIDS in the West is still overwhelmingly a threat to male homosexuals and intravenous drug users. It&#x27;s now found in other groups, but it has taken years for that to happen and they still represent the minority of sufferers. More than this, the bulk of the newly infected tend to be people who have contracted the virus through permissive sexual practices. 

With reference to the Bible, Coren would compare homosexuality to illegal sexual practices. In 2007, Coren wrote an &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot; article, saying:
As for Jesus not condemning homosexuality, nor did He condemn bestiality and necrophilia... Christ did indeed condemn homosexuality, as does the Old Testament, St. Paul, the church fathers and all Christianity until a few liberal Protestants in the last decades of the 20th century who, frankly, are more concerned with political correctness than truth.

=== International affairs ===

In September 2006, Coren published an article in the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; supporting the use of tactical nuclear strikes against Iran. This position was retracted the following year.

==Religious views==
Coren&#x27;s articles and speeches often include stories of his own personal spiritual journey. Coren&#x27;s father was Jewish as was his maternal grandfather, while his maternal grandmother came from a family of Welsh coal miners and converted to Judaism. Coren&#x27;s father and uncle were cab drivers. Coren has said that his father&#x27;s family left Poland in the 1890s, a few decades before The Holocaust. He said &quot;People have called me an anti-Semite. I thought it quite rich since my father&#x27;s family was massacred in the Holocaust&quot;. Michael Coren was profiled on &quot;Credo&quot; on Vision TV, and said that his father told him he could not attend his son&#x27;s wedding in a Catholic church without becoming &quot;physically sick&quot;.

He converted to Catholic Christianity in 1984 while still living in England, later saying that he &quot;converted to an institution.&quot;

He left Catholicism for Evangelicalism in the 1990s, after a conversion experience, greatly influenced by Canadian televangelist Terry Winter. In 1991, Coren said in a column for a humour magazine: &quot;Evangelicals may be intolerant, small-minded, and repellent, but at least they hold a consistent set of beliefs&quot;. In a 1993 book review, he said &quot;Can anyone imagine a detective priest? Regrettably, it is easier to conjure up the image of a priest being questioned by secular detectives over abuse charges.&quot; Also in 1993, he had a falling out with the Catholic Church over an unflattering profile he wrote of Archbishop Aloysius Ambrozic for &quot;Toronto Life&quot; magazine. The bishop, who had made Coren a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre in October 1992, was quoted using words including &quot;friggin&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot;, and said that the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco was a &quot;conservative Catholic and not a bad fellow&quot;. Coren defended himself, saying &quot;He&#x27;s an archbishop and he was vulgar ... obviously what thousands of Catholics expected me to do was lie. I still get hate mail about the article.&quot;

After this incident, Coren said that he didn&#x27;t consider himself a Catholic anymore. He said, &quot;My wife is Catholic and the children will be raised Catholic, but that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s just not there for me.&quot; Daniel Richler observed that Coren loves scandal, but hates having it come his way. In one of his columns for the satirical humour magazine &quot;Frank&quot;, Michael Coren depicted Mother Teresa getting drunk in a bar.

In early 2004, he embraced Catholicism again. He cites Thomas More, C. S. Lewis, Ronald Knox and his godfather Lord Longford as spiritual influences, and remains connected to the ecumenical scene in Canada and beyond.

In 2014, Michael Coren once again left the Catholic Church and began worshipping with the Anglican Church of Canada, being formally received into the communion the next year. In an interview with the &quot;National Post&quot; on 1 May 2015, he cited the Catholic Church&#x27;s teachings on homosexuality and contraception as some of the reasons for his conversion to Anglicanism.

In contrast to his previous views, Coren now identifies as a Christian socialist. Coren supports infant circumcision, which he calls a &quot;tradition [Jews and Muslims] consider holy and essential, based not in abuse and cruelty, but in concern and love for their child&quot;, and has said that its opponents are &quot;irreligious zealots&quot;.

Coren is a priest of the Anglican Diocese of Niagara. He was ordained deacon in October 2019, and ordained priest in September 2021. He serves as assistant curate of the parish of St Christopher, Burlington.

==Personal life==
Coren is a cousin of author and journalist Alan Coren, and is thus related to Alan&#x27;s children Victoria Coren Mitchell and Giles Coren.

Coren married his wife, Bernadette, in 1987. They have four children.

<doc id="695315" wikidata="Q887569" url="?curid=695315" title="The Cat Concerto">
<text>The Cat Concerto is a 1947 American one-reel animated cartoon and the 29th &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; short, released to theatres on April 26, 1947. It was produced by Fred Quimby and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, with musical supervision by Scott Bradley, and animation by Kenneth Muse, Ed Barge and Irven Spence and uncredited animation by Don Patterson.

==Plot==
At a formal concert, Tom plays Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&quot; on the piano. Jerry, who lives inside the piano, disrupts Tom&#x27;s performance by mock-conducting him. Tom flicks Jerry away and continues playing. Jerry emerges from under the piano keys, and Tom tries unsuccessfully to hit him with the key and smash him. Jerry manipulates the piano&#x27;s keys from inside, irritating Tom, who hits him with a tuning tool. In retaliation, Jerry slams the keyboard lid on Tom&#x27;s fingers and tries to cut his finger with scissors. After several failed attempts, Jerry sets a mousetrap, catching Tom&#x27;s finger.

Tom climbs onto the piano to chase Jerry, playing with his feet. Jerry dances on the felts, briefly changing the tune. Tom bounces Jerry with a chord, eventually catching him and throwing him into the piano stool. Jerry manipulates the seat controls, sending Tom crashing onto the keys. Tom, fed up, stuffs Jerry into the piano felts and goes wild on the piano. The felts bash Jerry around, but he emerges angry and retaliates by playing the rhapsody&#x27;s finale (along with two false endings) with felts as drumsticks, causing Tom to collapse in exhaustion. The audience applauds, and Jerry takes credit for the performance as a spotlight shines on him.

==Reception==
Following its release, &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot; was met with critical acclaim, and is considered one of the best Tom and Jerry cartoons. With an early showing in 1946 it qualified for and won the 1946 Oscar for Best Short Subject: Cartoons. In 1994, it was voted #42 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of All Time by members of the animation field.

The short won the duo their fourth consecutive Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, tied with Walt Disney Productions&#x27; musical series, &quot;Silly Symphonies&quot;. The short also appears in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time list as the number 434.

Film critic The Chiel of Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot; declared &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot; to be the best film of 1947, above &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, stating that &quot;in conception and animation I think that short reaches the highest level of screen fantasy and humor.&quot;

===Plagiarism dispute===
In the same year that MGM produced &quot;The Cat Concerto,&quot; Warner Bros. released a similar Bugs Bunny cartoon titled &quot;Rhapsody Rabbit,&quot; directed by Friz Freleng, featuring Bugs Bunny facing off against an unnamed mouse. Both cartoons shared nearly identical gags, featured the same piece by Franz Liszt, and had similar endings. The studios accused each other of plagiarism when both films were submitted for the 1947 Academy Awards ceremony. Technicolor was accused of sending a print of one cartoon to the competing studio, which allegedly plagiarized its rival&#x27;s work. The details of this accusation remain uncertain, although &quot;Rhapsody Rabbit&quot; has an earlier MPAA certificate number and release date, while &quot;The Cat Concerto&quot; had a higher production number at #165, compared to the other shorts released around the same time in the 150s range.

Both films are currently owned by Warner Bros. through Turner Entertainment Co. following a series of mergers and acquisitions. This controversy was later explored in an episode of the Cartoon Network series &quot;ToonHeads.&quot;

<text>Hank Roberts (born March 24, 1954, Terre Haute, Indiana) is an American jazz cellist and vocalist. He plays the electric cello, and his style is a mixture of rock, jazz, avant-garde, folk, and classical influences. He emerged with the downtown New York City jazz scene of the 1980s and is associated with its post-modern tendencies.

==Background==
In the early 1980s, Roberts made a number of recordings for the defunct JMT label, was a featured member of the Bill Frisell Quartet, and was an important voice in many groups of saxophonist Tim Berne. Roberts also recorded three discs with the Arcado String Trio, an improvisational chamber group featuring Mark Feldman, violin, and Mark Dresser, double bass. 

In the early 1990s, Roberts left Frisell&#x27;s group and stopped touring widely. He continued to release recordings, if sporadically, including with the progressive folk group Ti Ti Chickapea. In 2008, he was again touring and performing regularly, releasing &quot;Green&quot; (with Jim Black and Marc Ducret) on Winter &amp; Winter, Stefan F. Winters subsequent label to JMT. In December 2011, Winter &amp; Winter released Roberts&#x27; &quot;Everything Is Alive&quot;, as well as re-releasing his entire JMT catalogue.

<doc id="695319" wikidata="Q3977994" url="?curid=695319" title="Supermultiplet">
<text>In theoretical physics, a supermultiplet is a representation of a supersymmetry algebra, possibly with extended supersymmetry.

Then a superfield is a field on superspace which is valued in such a representation. Naïvely, or when considering flat superspace, a superfield can simply be viewed as a function on superspace. Formally, it is a section of an associated supermultiplet bundle.

Phenomenologically, superfields are used to describe particles. It is a feature of supersymmetric field theories that particles form pairs, called superpartners where bosons are paired with fermions.

These supersymmetric fields are used to build supersymmetric quantum field theories, where the fields are promoted to operators.

==History==
Superfields were introduced by Abdus Salam and J. A. Strathdee in a 1974 article. Operations on superfields and a partial classification were presented a few months later by Sergio Ferrara, Julius Wess and Bruno Zumino.

==Naming and classification==
The most commonly used supermultiplets are vector multiplets, chiral multiplets (in formula_1 supersymmetry for example), hypermultiplets (in formula_2 supersymmetry for example), tensor multiplets and gravity multiplets. The highest component of a vector multiplet is a gauge boson, the highest component of a chiral or hypermultiplet is a spinor, the highest component of a gravity multiplet is a graviton. The names are defined so as to be invariant under dimensional reduction, although the organization of the fields as representations of the Lorentz group changes.

The use of these names for the different multiplets can vary in literature. A chiral multiplet (whose highest component is a spinor) may sometimes be referred to as a &quot;scalar multiplet&quot;, and in formula_2 SUSY, a vector multiplet (whose highest component is a vector) can sometimes be referred to as a chiral multiplet.

== Superfields in d = 4, N = 1 supersymmetry ==
Conventions in this section follow the notes by .

A general complex superfield formula_4 in formula_5 supersymmetry can be expanded as

:formula_6,

where formula_7 are different complex fields. This is not an irreducible supermultiplet, and so different constraints are needed to isolate irreducible representations.

=== Chiral superfield ===
A (anti-)chiral superfield is a supermultiplet of formula_8 supersymmetry.

In four dimensions, the minimal formula_9 supersymmetry may be written using the notion of superspace. Superspace contains the usual space-time coordinates formula_10, formula_11, and four extra fermionic coordinates formula_12 with formula_13, transforming as a two-component (Weyl) spinor and its conjugate.

In formula_1 supersymmetry, a chiral superfield is a function over chiral superspace. There exists a projection from the (full) superspace to chiral superspace. So, a function over chiral
superspace can be pulled back to the full superspace. Such a function formula_15 satisfies the covariant constraint formula_16, where formula_17 is the covariant derivative, given in index notation as
:formula_18

A chiral superfield formula_15 can then be expanded as

:formula_20
where formula_21. The superfield is independent of the &#x27;conjugate spin coordinates&#x27; formula_22 in the sense that it depends on formula_22 only through formula_24. It can be checked that formula_25

The expansion has the interpretation that formula_26 is a complex scalar field, formula_27 is a Weyl spinor. There is also the auxiliary complex scalar field formula_28, named formula_28 by convention: this is the F-term which plays an important role in some theories.

The field can then be expressed in terms of the original coordinates formula_30 by substituting the expression for formula_31:
:formula_32

==== Antichiral superfields ====

Similarly, there is also antichiral superspace, which is the complex conjugate of chiral superspace, and antichiral superfields.

An antichiral superfield formula_33 satisfies formula_34 where
:formula_35

An antichiral superfield can be constructed as the complex conjugate of a chiral superfield.

==== Actions from chiral superfields ====
For an action which can be defined from a single chiral superfield, see Wess–Zumino model.

=== Vector superfield ===
The vector superfield is a supermultiplet of formula_36 supersymmetry.

A vector superfield (also known as a real superfield) is a function formula_37 which satisfies the reality condition formula_38. Such a field admits the expansion

:formula_39

The constituent fields are
* Two real scalar fields formula_40 and formula_41
* A complex scalar field formula_42
* Two Weyl spinor fields formula_43 and formula_44
* A real vector field (gauge field) formula_45

Their transformation properties and uses are further discussed in supersymmetric gauge theory.

Using gauge transformations, the fields formula_46 and formula_42 can be set to zero. This is known as Wess–Zumino gauge. In this gauge, the expansion takes on the much simpler form
:formula_48
Then formula_49 is the superpartner of formula_45, while formula_41 is an auxiliary scalar field. It is conventionally called formula_41, and is known as the D-term.

==Scalars==
A scalar is never the highest component of a superfield; whether it appears in a superfield at all depends on the dimension of the spacetime. For example, in a 10-dimensional N=1 theory the vector multiplet contains only a vector and a Majorana–Weyl spinor, while its dimensional reduction on a d-dimensional torus is a vector multiplet containing d real scalars. Similarly, in an 11-dimensional theory there is only one supermultiplet with a finite number of fields, the gravity multiplet, and it contains no scalars. However again its dimensional reduction on a d-torus to a maximal gravity multiplet does contain scalars.

==Hypermultiplet==

A hypermultiplet is a type of representation of an extended supersymmetry algebra, in particular the matter multiplet of formula_53 supersymmetry in 4 dimensions, containing two complex scalars &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;, a Dirac spinor ψ, and two further auxiliary complex scalars &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

The name &quot;hypermultiplet&quot; comes from old term &quot;hypersymmetry&quot; for &quot;N&quot;=2 supersymmetry used by ; this term has been abandoned, but the name &quot;hypermultiplet&quot; for some of its representations is still used.

== Extended supersymmetry (N &gt; 1) ==
This section records some commonly used irreducible supermultiplets in extended supersymmetry in the formula_54 case. These are constructed by a highest-weight representation construction in the sense that there is a vacuum vector annihilated by the supercharges formula_55. The irreps have dimension formula_56. For supermultiplets representing massless particles, on physical grounds the maximum allowed formula_57 is formula_58, while for renormalizability, the maximum allowed formula_57 is formula_60.

=== N = 2 ===
The formula_53 vector or chiral multiplet formula_62 contains a gauge field formula_45, two Weyl fermions formula_64, and a scalar formula_26 (which also transform in the adjoint representation of a gauge group). These can also be organised into a pair of formula_36 multiplets, an formula_36 vector multiplet formula_68 and chiral multiplet formula_69. Such a multiplet can be used to define Seiberg–Witten theory concisely.

The formula_53 hypermultiplet or scalar multiplet consists of two Weyl fermions and two complex scalars, or two formula_36 chiral multiplets.

=== N = 4 ===
The formula_60 vector multiplet contains one gauge field, four Weyl fermions, six scalars, and CPT conjugates. This appears in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory.

<text>The Biotic Baking Brigade is a loosely connected group of activists famous for throwing pies in the faces of such figures as Bill Gates, San Francisco mayors Willie Brown and Gavin Newsom, anti-gay preacher Fred Phelps, economist Milton Friedman, Swedish King Carl Gustaf, former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, conservative journalist William F. Buckley, right-wing Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, former WTO head Renato Ruggiero, and Ann Coulter, among others.

The group espouses a left-wing philosophy, with members also active in ecology, social justice, gay rights, animal rights, anarchist and feminist movements, with connections to groups like Earth First!, Food Not Bombs, and ACT UP. It opposes corporate neoliberalism as well as any institution or individual who commits &quot;crimes against people and the land.&quot;

Concerning the group, popular activist Jim Hightower has stated &quot;The BBB&#x27;s pies are the Boston Tea Party of our modern day, sending a serious message softly to the corporate oligarchy.&quot; Jello Biafra has similarly asked, &quot;Is well placed humor one of the best protest tactics there is? The proof is in the pudding! Or should I saypie cream.&quot;

Members have been tried for battery and assault as a result of their pieing.

<doc id="695329" wikidata="Q4955646" url="?curid=695329" title="Braid statistics">
<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, braid statistics is a generalization of the spin statistics of bosons and fermions based on the concept of braid group. While for fermions (bosons) the corresponding statistics is associated to a phase gain of formula_1 (formula_2) under the exchange of identical particles, a particle with braid statistics leads to a rational fraction of formula_1 under such exchange or even a non-trivial unitary transformation in the Hilbert space (see non-Abelian anyons). A similar notion exists using a loop braid group.

== Plektons ==
Braid statistics are applicable to theoretical particles such as the two-dimensional anyons and plektons.

A plekton is a hypothetical type of particle that obeys a different style of statistics with respect to the interchange of identical particles. It obeys the causality rules of algebraic quantum field theory, where only observable quantities need to commute at spacelike separation, where anyons follow the stronger rules of traditional quantum field theory; this leads, for example, to (2+1)&quot;D&quot; anyons being massless.

<doc id="695334" wikidata="Q7166013" url="?curid=695334" title="People to People Student Ambassador Program">
<text>The People to People Student Ambassador Program was a travel service based in Spokane, Washington, offering domestic and international travel opportunities to middle and high school students. The group was founded in 1956, during the Eisenhower administration, and reincorporated in 1995. It converted in 2002 to a for-profit company, Ambassadors Group. It ceased student travel operations in 2015.

Since its founding, nearly half a million students, adults and athletes participated in the ambassador programs. From 2002 to 2015, the services offered were operated by Ambassadors Group, a for-profit company. Though open to international primary and secondary school students, programs were primarily for American students aged 10 through 18. In the late 20th century, the typical length of a program was three weeks for a group of thirty to forty students. Ambassadors Group ceased operations for student travel on July 13, 2015.

== History ==

In 1956, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sought diplomatic alternatives to the wars he witnessed as a soldier, general and Allied Commander. On September 11, 1956, he called a White House conference of 100 top American leaders, who joined him in creating the People to People initiative, focused on creating cultural exchange programs. This conference followed a Geneva summit, at which Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev expressed enthusiasm for exchange programs as a means to ease Cold War tensions. Participants in this conference included Joyce Hall, founder of Hallmark Cards; comedian Bob Hope; and creative entertainer Walt Disney. He became one of the founding directors of People to People and later drew inspiration from the initiative to create the &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; attraction at Disneyland in 1964.

The program was originally sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency, of the Federal government. In 1961, Eisenhower decided that it should be carried on by private citizens and asked Joyce Hall to facilitate the privatization. That same year, the nonprofit People to People International began a contractual relationship with Ambassador Programs, Inc. to administer People to People travel programs for adults and students. In 1962, the first delegation of university students traveled overseas and stayed with families across Europe.

Regular annual programs began in 1967. Until expansion in the 1980s, the organization sent only a few hundred students abroad each year. In 2002, People to People International granted a license to operate student programs under the &quot;People to People Student Ambassador Program&quot; name to Ambassadors Group, which had been formed as a separate company from the Ambassadors Education Group. The Company closed in 2015.

== Programs ==

People to People Ambassador Programs offered four types of ambassador travel, including international student ambassador travel, domestic leadership ambassador summits and forums, international collegiate ambassador travel, and international citizen ambassador travel for industry professionals.

Countries visited included Germany, France, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malta, Italy, Greece, Fiji, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and Russia. Experienced students who were alumni of the program and wanted to travel again were given the chance to choose more exotic destinations for subsequent trips such as South Africa, or Antarctica. Programs typically departed between June and August, rather than during the academic year, in groups of between thirty and forty students. The target student-teacher ratio was 10-to-1.

Trips usually were composed of students from a given city or county, not from a specific school. Tuition – the fees charged for a trip – ranged from $4,500 for trips to Canada, to more than $7,999 for trips to Australia and South Pacific destinations. A trip to Antarctica was available for $12,500, however this fee was not listed on their website in 2014.

During the trips, students attended various educational activities, and had the chance to meet local leaders and dignitaries. Trips also featured such outdoor activities as hiking, snorkeling, zip-lining or rappelling. Longer itineraries included a 2- to 3-day home stay with a local family.

Each student ambassador travel program included a service component in which ambassadors participated in hands-on community service projects. Participants could earn high school or college credit for classes through the Washington School of World Studies (operated by People to People), and through Eastern Washington University.

People to People Ambassador Programs also offered domestic student trips for grade school, middle school and high school students through Leadership Ambassador Programs. These programs were focused on leadership development, community involvement, civics education and college preparation. Leadership Ambassador Programs included student trips to various U.S. destinations, including Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles, to hear from speakers and industry experts, and exchange ideas with their peers from around the world. On these four- to ten-day programs, delegates engaged in leadership curriculum, team-building and personal development exercises.

==Applications==
Any student (5th grade or older) could apply to travel on a program. All students must complete an application and an interview process before they can go on a trip to ensure that they possess the maturity and social skills needed for extended travel.

The nomination process was open to any applicant. Some parents complained in 2006 that the program&#x27;s marketing made it appear that their child was exclusively selected or nominated to participate. The Iowa Attorney General investigated the program&#x27;s operator in 2006 after an invitation was accidentally sent to the long-deceased child of a family. The operator modified the invitation and presentation process. In another case, a family received a People to People solicitation claiming under the name of their late family pet, that it had been selected as an ambassador.

==Controversies==

In 2007, student ambassador Tyler Hill died of complications following his group&#x27;s hike on Mount Fuji in Japan. The family sued the program and its parent company, reaching a settlement in 2009.

In 2008, People to People invested more than $3 million to support health and safety initiatives for participants. The company also hired a full-time Senior Director of Health and Safety and began a Safe Travel 24/7 blog. In 2010, People to People Ambassador Programs launched the FindMe program with Cellhire that allowed a mobile phone to be tracked using GPS or cell tower triangulation. Parents of students could also rent the FindMe phone and have text conversations with their children through the FindMe website.

In July 2011, CBS News reported that People to People had retained a for-profit marketing company, AmbassadorsGroup to solicit participants. Among their reportedly questionable tactics: solicitations to long-deceased children citing their &quot;exceptional academic performance&quot; as the reason for the solicitation , and the signed endorsement of a Virginia State Senator without her endorsement or knowledge.

<doc id="695339" wikidata="Q4941285" url="?curid=695339" title="Bond Hill, Cincinnati">
<text>Bond Hill is one of the 52 neighborhoods of Cincinnati, Ohio. Founded as a railroad suburb and temperance community in 1870 in northeastern Millcreek Township, it is one of a number of neighborhoods lining the Mill Creek. The population was 7,002 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Early History===
Bond Hill began as a commuter suburb connected to Cincinnati via the Marietta-Cincinnati Railroad. It was founded by a cooperative building association, the &quot;Cooperative Land and Building Association No.1 of Hamilton County, Ohio&quot;, the first post-Civil War housing cooperative in Cincinnati and the first building association to be organized along ideological and not ethnic lines. The cooperative was organized in 1870 by five men including several teetotallers from nearby Cumminsville. The cooperative initially planned on building in Cumminsville but for unknown reasons, the co-op changed the site of their development to the area, which they renamed Bond Hill. The change was likely suggested by a founding member of the cooperative, Henry Watkin, an utopian socialist and expatriate English printer.

For at least 11 years after its founding in 1870, the sale of liquor was prohibited in Bond Hill according to the Constitution and By-Laws of the Cooperative. In the early 1880s, a disagreement centered on Bond Hill&#x27;s church, considered by some to be non-denominational and by others to be Presbyterian, likely caused a schism within the early community and the cooperative. The role of Watkin and the early founders in the leadership of the community declined after the schism, and Bond Hill incorporated as the Village of Bond Hill in 1886.

The origin of the name Bond Hill remains something of a mystery. Newspaper articles documenting the founding and naming of the railroad suburb by the cooperative indicate that Bond Hill was the name of the area in the 1830s: &quot;This was the name of that particular locality forty years ago, and carries with it associations not easily forgotten by the oldest inhabitants,&quot; (January 10, 1871, &quot;Cincinnati Daily Enquirer&quot;). An oral history transcribed in 1961 by George E. Patmor, one of the village&#x27;s earliest residents, indicates that the name was first given by visitors to a sawmill operated by a man named Bond: &quot;In these days the people of St. Bernard and Cincinnati would use a footpath through the woods &#x27;for a shortcut from St. Bernard to Bond’s sawmill to work or transact business.&#x27; It got to be a common saying that they were going up on Bond Hill, so this is how we got the name &#x27;Bond Hill&#x27;.&quot; Local historian, Aharon Varady, speculates that like other mills in upper Millcreek Township, Bond&#x27;s Mill may have been a gathering site for gambling and traveling teamsters—associations which nearby residents may have wished to be forgotten.

===Annexation and Development===
The village was annexed by Cincinnati in 1903. Until the mid-1930s, Bond Hill was largely rural and surrounded by orchards and dairy farms. New parkways, such as Bloody Run (later Victory) Parkway, replaced the Miami-Erie Canal as the main route into and out of the neighborhood. As a result, residential and industrial developments replaced the agricultural zones. In the north, a regional high school, parking lot and shopping complex were built in the 1950s. Further development occurred in the 1960s due to the construction of the Interstate 75 Millcreek Expressway in western Bond Hill and the Norwood Lateral (State Route 562) extension in southern Bond Hill. Community residents opposed these developments but were largely ignored.

The environmental degradation and urbanization of the neighborhood presaged the exit of whites from Bond Hill in the 1960s and 1970s. Realtors and local banks actively encouraged the demographic transition of the neighborhood through redlining, blockbusting, and racial steering. The Bond Hill-Roselawn Community Council was founded in 1965 to combat this change. Throughout the next twenty years the Bond Hill Community Council attempted to develop a community plan and to halt white flight. Their achievements included the creation of a Bond Hill Community Master Plan in 1977 and the recognition of the &quot;Old Bond Hill Village&quot; Historic District in 1982.

In 2016, the 1977 Community Master Plan was superseded by the publication of the Bond Hill + Roselawn Community Plan, created by the Bond Hill + Roselawn Collaborative, which replaced the Bond Hill-Community Council. The BH+R Community Plan was finalized after two years of input from community volunteers and leaders, business owners, pastors and parishioners.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 7,002 people living in the neighborhood. There were 3,581 housing units. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 6.7% White, 87.0% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.6% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from some other race, and 4.0% from two or more races. 3.1% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 3,243 households, out of which 51.5% were families. 45.3% of all households were made up of individuals.

25.7% of the neighborhood&#x27;s population were under the age of 18, 54.1% were 18 to 64, and 20.2% were 65 years of age or older. 48.6% of the population were male and 51.4% were female.

According to the U.S. Census American Community Survey, for the period 2016-2020 the estimated median annual income for a household in the neighborhood was $39,637. About 20.4% of family households were living below the poverty line. About 18.0% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

==The Bond Hill Bella Vista Historic District==
On October 16, 2019, The Cincinnati City Council unanimously voted to designate The Bond Hill Bella Vista Historic District the city&#x27;s 25th historic district. The Bond Hill Bella Vista Historic District runs east of Reading Road, for the entirety of Bella Vista Street, which is a one-block, no outlet road with all underground utilities. The Bond Hill Bella Vista Historic District is Cincinnati&#x27;s first predominantly Tudor Revival historic district as well as its first predominantly 1920s–1930s historic district.

<text>Thomas Henry Corra (September 14, 1953 – April 9, 1998), better known as Tom Cora, was an American cellist and composer, best known for his improvisational performances in the field of experimental jazz and rock. He recorded with John Zorn, Butch Morris, and the Ex, and was a member of Curlew, Third Person and Skeleton Crew.

==Biography==
Tom Cora was born in Yancey Mills, Virginia, United States. He made his musical debut as drummer on a local television program and in the mid-1970s he played guitar for a Washington, D.C. jazz club house band. He took up the cello while an undergraduate at the University of Virginia and studied with cellist Pablo Casals&#x27; student Luis Garcia-Renart and later with vibraphonist Karl Berger. During this time he formed his own group, the Moose Skowron Tuned Metal Ensemble and began constructing instruments for it.

In 1979 Cora moved to New York City, where he worked with Shockabilly guitarist Eugene Chadbourne, introducing the cello to the honky tonk circuits of North America. He performed at improvising clubs and venues in New York with John Zorn, Fred Frith, Andrea Centazzo, Butch Morris, Wayne Horvitz, David Moss, Toshinori Kondo and others. Cora also collaborated with George Cartwright and Bill Laswell which led to the formation of the art rock band Curlew in 1979. Cora remained with Curlew for over ten years and appeared on five of their albums.

In 1982 Tom Cora and Fred Frith formed Skeleton Crew, an improvising rock and jazz band best known for their live performances where they played various instruments simultaneously. Cora and Frith were each one-man bands on stage and for their act, Cora constructed musical contraptions he could play with his feet. The band existed for five years during which time they toured Europe, North America and Japan extensively. They made two studio albums, &quot;Learn to Talk&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Country of Blinds&quot; (1986), the latter with Zeena Parkins who had joined the band in 1984. In October 1983 Skeleton Crew joined Duck and Cover, a commission from the Berlin Jazz Festival, for a performance in West Berlin, followed by another in February 1984 in East Berlin.

Cora was also a member of the improvising trio Third Person, formed in 1990 as a live collaboration with percussionist Samm Bennett and a &quot;third person&quot; who changed from concert to concert. Two CDs of some of their performances were released, &quot;The Bends&quot; in 1991 (with &quot;third persons&quot; Don Byron, George Cartwright, Chris Cochrane, Nic Collins, Catherine Jauniaux, Myra Melford, Zeena Parkins, and Marc Ribot) and &quot;Luck Water&quot; in 1995 (with &quot;third person&quot; Kazutoki Umezu).

Cora performed with a number of other bands, including Nimal with Momo Rossel and post-rock quartet Roof. In 1990, he played two concerts with Dutch anarcho-punk band, the Ex, and the success of this collaboration resulted in Cora performing hundreds of concerts with the Ex and appearing on two of their CDs. In 1995 in The Netherlands, Cora and Frith collaborated, as Skeleton Crew, on &quot;Etymology&quot;, a CD-ROM sound sample library of sonic sounds and wire manipulations.

Tom Cora died of malignant melanoma at the age of 44 in a hospital in the south of France, where he lived with his wife, singer Catherine Jauniaux, and their son, Elia Corra.

A month after Cora&#x27;s death, a benefit concert in aid of his family was held at the Knitting Factory with appearances by Catherine Jauniaux, Fred Frith, George Cartwright, Zeena Parkins and others. A CD of this concert, &quot;It&#x27;s a Brand New Day – Live at the Knitting Factory&quot;, produced by John Zorn, was released on Knitting Factory Records in 2000. But the good intentions of all concerned were never realised when Knitting Factory Records was bought out and Jauniaux received no royalties from the sale of the CD.

John Zorn also compiled &quot;Hallelujah, Anyway – Remembering Tom Cora&quot;, a two-CD set featuring a selection of recordings by Cora and some of the groups he recorded with, plus new recordings of Cora&#x27;s compositions.

Cora appeared in Nicolas Humbert and Werner Penzel&#x27;s 1990 documentary film on Fred Frith, &quot;Step Across the Border&quot;, in which Cora and Frith are filmed rehearsing at The Kitchen, New York City in February 1989.

===Solo work===
In addition to performing with other bands and musicians, Cora began a solo concert career in 1986. The prospect of managing a concert-length performance single-handedly was a challenge with risks, but he learned to balance risk with intention and the results were solo performances across North America, Europe and Japan. Two live albums from some of these performances were released in 1987 and 1991.

While in The Netherlands, Cora spent two months at STEIM, the electro-acoustic research centre in Amsterdam, where he tailored a live sampling and triggering system to be played with his feet. He unveiled the system in a 25 concert solo tour in 1992. Unfortunately, the unique tailor-made instrument constructed at STEIM was later lost, forgotten on a train from Neuchâtel to La Chaux-de-Fonds while touring Switzerland.

Besides performing, Cora composed music for the National Film Board of Canada, choreographer Donna Uchizono (for which he received a New York Dance and Performance Award in 1990), and a solo cello film score for Dziga Vertov&#x27;s, &quot;Man with the Movie Camera&quot;, commissioned by the American Museum of the Moving Image. In 1994 Cora was awarded a Meet the Composer Commissioning Grant to compose an ensemble score for &quot;Man with the Movie Camera&quot;. It was performed at several North American venues and in Europe in 1996.

===Technique===
Tom Cora&#x27;s cello was prepared, electronically modified and highly amplified. He developed the style of playing sawed chords and percussive riffs as if his cello was an electric guitar. He banged, scraped and twisted it and did whatever else was necessary to produce the sounds he wanted.

Cora explored non-idiomatic improvising and studied Turkish and Eastern European folk music. The influence of this folk music is evident in much of his work. Skeleton Crew once devoted an entire concert to playing only Eastern European folk tunes.

On the stage, his presence was striking. Ed Baxter noted in his biography of Tom Cora:

<text>The New York City Subway is a large rapid transit system and has a large fleet of electric multiple unit rolling stock. , the New York City Subway has cars on the roster.

The system maintains two separate fleets of passenger cars: one for the A Division (numbered) routes, the other for the B Division (lettered) routes. All A Division equipment is approximately wide and long. B Division cars, on the other hand, are about wide and either or long. The A Division and B Division trains operate only in their own division; operating in the other division is not allowed. All rolling stock, in both the A and B Divisions, run on the same standard gauge and use the same third-rail geometry and voltage. A typical revenue train consists of 8 to 10 cars, although in practice they can range between 2 and 11 cars.

The subway&#x27;s rolling stock have operated under various companies: the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT), Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit (BMT), and Independent Subway System (IND), all of which have since merged into the New York City Transit Authority. Cars purchased by the City of New York since the inception of the IND and for the other divisions beginning in 1948 are identified by the letter &quot;R&quot; followed by a number. Various kinds of cars are also used for maintenance work, including flatcars and vacuum trains.

==Total fleet==
, the New York City Subway has cars on the roster. The system maintains two separate fleets of passenger cars: one for the A Division routes, the other for the B Division routes. There are 2,890 A Division cars and 3,822 B Division cars . All A Division equipment is approximately wide and long. B Division cars are larger, about wide and either or long. The 75-foot cars, the R44s, R46s, R68s, and R68As, are not permitted on BMT Eastern Division – the J, L, M, and Z trains – because of sharper curves on those tracks.

All rolling stock, in both the A and B Divisions, run on the same standard gauge and use the same third-rail geometry and voltage. However, trains operate only in their own division; operating in the other division is not allowed. A Division sections have narrower tunnel segments, tighter curves, and tighter platform clearances than the B Division sections, so B Division trains cannot fit in the A Division tunnels and stations, while A Division trains would have an unacceptably large gap between the platform and train if they were allowed in service on B Division lines. Also, the safety train stop (trip cock) mechanism is not compatible between divisions, being located on opposite sides of the track and train in each division. However, service and maintenance trains are composed of A Division-sized cars, so they can operate with either division&#x27;s clearances and have safety train stops installed on both sides of the trucks.

A typical revenue train consists of 8 or 10 cars. The exceptions are the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, which runs 2-car trains; the Rockaway Park Shuttle, which runs 4- and 5-car trains; the 42nd Street Shuttle, which runs 6-car trains; the , which runs 5-car trains; and the , which runs 11-car trains.

When the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company entered into agreements to operate some of the new subway lines, they decided to design a new type of car, wide and long. The subject of several patents, the car&#x27;s larger profile was similar to that of steam railroad coaches, permitting greater passenger capacity, more comfortable seating, and other advantages. The BRT unveiled its design, designated BMT Standard, to the public in 1913 and received such wide acceptance that all future subway lines, whether built for the BRT, the IRT, or eventually the IND, were built to handle the wider cars.

When the R44s and R46s were rebuilt, the rollsigns on the side of the cars were replaced with electronic LCD signs while the front service sign remained as a rollsign. In sharp contrast, the rebuilt R32s and R38s retained rollsigns on the sides, but a flip-dot display was placed in the front. The MTA has been incorporating newer subway cars into its stock in the past two decades. Since 1999, the R142s, R142As, R143s, R160s, R179s, R188s, and R211s have been added into service. All cars built since 1992 (including the now out-of-service R110As and R110Bs) are equipped with digital signs on the front, sides, and interior (except for the R110Bs, which had rollsigns on the front).

Old cars, some from the original companies (IRT, BMT, and IND), are preserved at the New York Transit Museum, while others have been sold to private individuals and/or other railway/trolley museums. Private companies include Railway Preservation Corp., whose equipment is often used on New York Transit Museum-sponsored excursions.

Between 1984 and 1989, some of the IRT trains were painted red, giving them the name Redbirds. By January 2022, various older B Division cars, such as the entire fleets of R32s, R38s, R40s, R40As, R42s, and NYCT R44s, were similarly retired and replaced by newer models, including the R160s and R179s.

===General Overhaul Program===
The General Overhaul Program (GOH) was a mid-life overhaul program for neglected subway cars, which involved a thorough rebuilding of the fleet. Since the completion of the GOH program, the new Scheduled Maintenance System (SMS) program has replaced the GOH program by ensuring that trains do not reach a state in which they would need such an overhaul. The car types, which were part of the MTA NYCT GOH program, are the IRT Redbirds (R26, R28, R29, R33, R33S, R36), as well as IND/BMT cars (R30 GE, R32, R38, R40, R40A, R42, R44, and R46). These cars were rebuilt between 1985 and 1993. Some cars in various classes from R10 to R46 were also given lighter overhauls during this period.

===&quot;R&quot;-prefixed orders===

Cars purchased by the City of New York since the inception of the IND and for the other divisions beginning in 1948 are identified by the letter &quot;R&quot; followed by a number, e.g., R46. This number is the contract number under which the cars were purchased. Cars with nearby contract numbers (e.g., R1 through R9, or R21 through R36, or R143 through R179) may be virtually identical, simply being purchased under different contracts.

The New York City Board of Transportation settled on a system of documentation that is still in place under MTA New York City Transit. This included a prefix letter or letters that indicated the department that the specific documentation, followed by a series of numbers of a length defined by the specific department concerned. For example, the Surface Department used the letter &quot;S&quot;, while the Rapid Transit Department used the letter &quot;R&quot;. A new R- number is assigned for any vehicle purchase involving a bidding process. Since the 1970s, the system has suffered from &quot;R- inflation&quot; going through only 46 R- numbers in its first 40 years, but over 114 in its subsequent 30. Possible reasons include an increased number of specialized maintenance vehicles that were previously made in house or a lower floor for requiring a formal bidding process to reduce waste and abuse.

=== Disposal at sea ===

In 2001, the New York City Transit Authority started disposing of retired subway cars by dumping them at sea to create artificial reefs, with the intention of promoting marine life. This option was chosen because it was less expensive than removing asbestos from the cars; the asbestos was determined to not be a hazard in the ocean. 

The artificial reefs would provide environmental and economic benefits, such as providing shelter for marine animals and creating new fishing opportunities. The first reef constructed was Redbird Reef in Delaware. Eventually, multiple states received retired subway cars for reefs. The program was discontinued in 2010, after more than 2,500 cars were reefed, because newer cars contained more plastic, which was too expensive to economically remove before reefing.

Various kinds of cars are used for maintenance work, including flatcars and vacuum trains.

===Track geometry car===

There are four track geometry cars on the New York City Subway that measure the system&#x27;s track geometry to ensure that safe train operation is maintained. The cars are numbered TGC1–TGC4. TGC1 was ordered under contract R59 in 1984 for $1.4 million, TGC2 was ordered under contract R63 and cost $2.5 million. Contract R-34152 purchasing TGC3 was awarded on December 29, 2004, for $9,610,963, and after additional funding was later authorized by the Board, Modification 1 exercising the Option for TGC4 was awarded on January 18, 2006, for $9,622,858. Subsequent modifications added newer equipment, such as a more advanced laser scanner, to TGC4 prior to its delivery to NYCTA. The cars use sensors, measuring systems, and data management systems to get a profile of the tracks. The train crew consists of two-track equipment maintainers, one maintenance supervisor, and two to three engineers. The trains typically operate during off-peak weekday daytime hours so as to not interfere with more frequent rush hour service. A single car weighs 45 tons. The cars measure:
* Alignment – &quot;Alignment is the projection of the track geometry of each rail or the track center line onto the horizontal plane,&quot; (FRA Definition). Also known as the &quot;straightness&quot; of the tracks.
* Crosslevel – The variation in the cant of the track over the length of a predetermined &quot;chord&quot; length (generally ). On straight or tangent track, ideally, there should be no variation, while on curves, a cant is generally desired.
* Curvature – The amount by which the rail deviates from being straight or tangent. The geometry car checks the actual curvature (in Degree of curvature) of a curve versus its design curvature.
* Rail gauge – The distance between the rails. Over time, rail may become too wide or too narrow. In North America and most of the world, standard gauge is 4 ft 8½ in (1,435 mm).
* Rail profile – Looks for rail wear and deviations from standard profile.
* Warp – The maximum change in crosslevel over a predetermined chord length (generally sixty-two feet).
* Corrugation of running rail surface
* Tunnel and station platform clearances
* Third rail height and gauge
* Vertical gap between third rail and protective board

The track geometry car typically checks each stretch of track about 6 times a year; the car is manually operated, and there are no plans to automate inspection of the track geometry, which is done manually with the help of high-tech equipment aboard the car.

==Miscellaneous==
* Air conditioning is standard on all cars R42 and later. R38s 4140–4149 and R40s 4350–4549 were also delivered with A/C, and all cars not equipped with A/C from classes R26–R40 (with the exception of the R27, R30, and R33S) were later retrofitted with A/C. All active cars are equipped with air conditioning, and cars with malfunctioning air conditioning are not supposed to be put into service.
* During World War II, a group of late-19th-century New York elevated cars was sent west to the San Francisco Bay Area by the United States Maritime Commission for use by the Shipyard Railway, a temporary wartime electric line transporting workers to the Kaiser Shipyards. After the war, most were sold to be used as units in a local motel, but their whereabouts afterward is unknown. Two of them, however, were acquired and have been restored by the Western Railway Museum in Rio Vista, California.
* There are many examples of rolling stock built under contract that are not intended for revenue services, such as the R95 money train, R65 pump train, R127/R134 garbage train, and R156 work locomotive.
* After the September 11th attacks, an American flag decal was added to every active subway car in the system. This practice continued with new car orders through the early 2020s.
* The table below shows what year the TA had expected to retire several car models in 1981.

<text>U.S. Route 62 or U.S. Highway 62 (US 62) is an east–west United States Highway in the southern and northeastern United States. It runs from the Mexican border at El Paso, Texas, to Niagara Falls, New York, near the Canadian border. It is the only east–west United States Numbered Highway that connects Mexico and Canada. Parts of US 62 follow what once was the Ozark Trail, including the historic bridge across the South Canadian River in Newcastle, Oklahoma (the first structure built with federal highway funds in Oklahoma after lobbying efforts by Stanley Draper). This bridge was damaged beyond repair by the 2013 Moore tornado that struck Newcastle and Moore, Oklahoma. The highway is signed north–south in New York and Pennsylvania reflecting its directional orientation in both states, and is signed east-west the remainder of its course.

===West Texas===

US 62 has two separate segments in Texas, separated by a portion in New Mexico with the first section in Texas from its terminus in El Paso to the state line in the Guadalupe Mountains. Through El Paso, US 62 begins at the Santa Fe Street Bridge, and follows Santa Fe Street, then Paisano Drive. At the Paisano Drive underpass for I-10 (I-10 exit 23B), US 62 runs concurrently with US 180, while US 180 ends its concurrency with I-10. The route then follows Montana Avenue, continuing the concurrency with US 180 until Seminole. Before exiting Texas, the route passes through the Salt Flats of Texas, the southern base of Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in Texas, and Guadalupe Mountains National Park.

===New Mexico===

Through New Mexico, US 62 is entirely concurrent with US 180. The highway continues past Carlsbad Caverns National Park and White&#x27;s City into the city of Carlsbad. In Carlsbad, US 285 joins US 62/US 180 for approximately , then heads east to Hobbs. US 62 comes within of the WIPP Plant while also coming across several State Highway termini: New Mexico State Road 360 (NM 360), NM 176, NM 243, NM 529, NM 483, and NM 8 along the stretch. US 62 comes into Hobbs along Marland Boulevard. After coming close to Hobbs High School&#x27;s Watson Stadium, US 62 leaves Hobbs going east to the Texas–New Mexico state line.

===Texas Panhandle===

After re-entering Texas, US 62 continues east through Seminole where US 180 heads east towards Lamesa and US 62 turns north northeast along a concurrency with US 385 through Seagraves and Brownfield. In Brownfield, US 62 picks up US 82/US 380 from Plains for a four-way concurrency for about two blocks, where US 380 heads east toward Tahoka. US 385 drops off approximately later to head northwest toward Levelland. US 82 continues as a concurrency with US 62 into Lubbock. US 62 splits from US 82 and joins with State Highway 114 (SH 114) for approximately along the campus of Texas Tech University&#x27;s southern border. On the east side of Lubbock, US 82 joins back into US 62/SH 114 and then continues east passes through Lorenzo, then leaves off the concurrency and forms a spur around Ralls, locally known as the &quot;US 62 Loop&quot;. The route then turns north to form a concurrency with SH 207 up to Floydada, where US 70 joins in for east and then SH 207 turns north of the east side of Floydada. US 62/US 70 then east through Matador to Paducah, and north again dropping off US 70 and gaining US 83 through Childress to a point to the north of Childress where it turns east alone, before crossing the Texas–Oklahoma border west of Hollis.

===Oklahoma===

US 62 runs east from the Texas border across Southwest Oklahoma through Hollis, Gould and Altus and then continues east bypassing the communities of Headrick, Snyder, Indiahoma and Cache into Lawton. On the north side of Lawton, US 62 joins I-44 as a concurrent route for through the Fort Sill Military Reservation and then splits on its own at Exit 46 near Medicine Park to continue north through Apache then north and east toward Anadarko. From Anadarko, US 62 runs east through Verden to Chickasha and northeast through Blanchard and then Newcastle before returning to a concurrent route with I-44 into Oklahoma City and then with I-240 and I-35 through much of the city before leaving I-35 at Northeast 23rd Street (exit 130) east of the Oklahoma State Capitol. It leaves Oklahoma City at 23rd street and heads east through Midwest City, Spencer, Nicoma Park, Choctaw, Harrah, Meeker and Boley to Okemah. At Okemah, US 62 overlaps I-40 for to Henryetta. US 62 then leaves I-40 to continue north to Okmulgee and east to Muskogee, and heads northeast through Fort Gibson and Tahlequah and into Arkansas.

In addition to sections of I-44, I-240, I-35 and I-40, US 62 also runs concurrent with other US highways over its miles across Oklahoma including US 281 from Lawton to Anadarko and US 277 from Lawton north about 11 miles (both including the I-44 concurrency north of Lawton), US 81 in the Chickasha city limits, a second US 277 concurrency from Chickasha to Newcastle, US 75 from Henryetta to Okmulgee, US 64 from an intersection near Taft to Muskogee and US 69 in the Muskogee city limits. US 62 business routes are designated through the cities of Snyder and Muskogee.

===Arkansas===
In the state of Arkansas, US 62 runs from the Oklahoma border near Summers east to the Missouri border in St. Francis, serving the northern portion of the state. The route passes through several cities and towns, including Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville, and Rogers. US 62 runs concurrently with several highways in Arkansas including I-49 and US 71 between Fayetteville and Bentonville, US 412 through much of the state, US 65 in the Harrison area, and with US 63 and US 67 (Future I-57) in northeast Arkansas.

===Missouri===
US 62 enters Missouri from Arkansas at Whitaker Place, and proceeds more or less easterly across the Missouri Bootheel via Malden to New Madrid. Between Malden and New Madrid, US 62 was designated as Route 82 in 1922. The part southwest of Campbell was designated as Route 93 in 1930. The part from Malden to Campbell was unnumbered until it became US 62. At New Madrid US 62 begins a concurrency with US 61. The combined US 61/62 goes north as far as Sikeston, where US 62 resumes its easterly direction. From Sikeston US 62 runs east to Charleston, where it is concurrent with Business I-57 for a short distance. After crossing I-57, US 62 becomes concurrent with US 60, this concurrency continues until US 60/62 leave Missouri by way of the Mississippi River bridge into Cairo Ill.

===Illinois===

US 62 overlaps US 60 for its entire length, , in Illinois. It crosses Illinois at its very southern tip between the Mississippi and Ohio rivers at Cairo. US 62 enters Illinois from Missouri by means of a bridge over the Mississippi River, turning east at US 51 with US 51 joining the concurrency. The three routes immediately cross into Kentucky via the Cairo Ohio River Bridge.

===Kentucky===

US 62 runs right through the tourist section of Western Kentucky; between the cities of Paducah and Eddyville, it passes Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley, two large manmade lakes. From there US 62 heads east through the cities of Princeton, Central City, Beaver Dam, Leitchfield, Elizabethtown, Bardstown, Lawrenceburg and Midway. For much of this portion, US 62 is paralleled by portions of the Kentucky Parkway System, including the Western Kentucky Parkway (I-69) and the Bluegrass Parkway, which have taken most long-distance and freight traffic off the old US 62 route. After passing through Georgetown and Cynthiana it leaves Kentucky in Maysville over the Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge.

US 62 is the only US Highway to cross the Ohio River twice. It crosses the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, connecting the far western region of Kentucky with the southern tip of Illinois. Its other crossing over the Ohio River connects the northeastern Kentucky city of Maysville and the southwestern Ohio village of Aberdeen.

===Ohio===
US 62 enters Ohio from Kentucky, crossing the Ohio River at Aberdeen. After the river crossing, the highway follows US 52 until Ripley and US 68 until just east of Georgetown. From there, US 62 enters the towns of Russellville, Hillsboro, and Washington Court House. In Washington Court House, US 62 meets up with State Route 3 (SR 3) and continues all the way into Columbus, passing through the towns of Mount Sterling, Orient, Harrisburg, and Grove City. After heading toward downtown Columbus, US 62 diverts from SR 3 onto US 40 (Broad Street) for a few blocks to Nelson Road. US 62 runs concurrently with I-670 near John Glenn Columbus International Airport until the eastern side of I-270 where US 62 heads toward Gahanna, New Albany, Johnstown, Utica, Millersburg, and Navarre. About north of Navarre, US 62 joins up with US 30 into Canton, where US 62 heads north along I-77. The highway passes West Lawn Cemetery and the President William McKinley memorial and tomb in Canton. At exit 107B on I-77, US 62 heads northeast to Alliance, and Youngstown. It leaves Ohio near Hubbard and enters Pennsylvania near the interchange for I-80.

===Pennsylvania===

US 62 enters Pennsylvania from Ohio in Sharon. Also, at the Ohio–Pennsylvania state line, signage for US 62 changes from an east–west to north–south. US 62 also runs north-northeast from the Ohio border towards New York. US 62 passes through Mercer and runs across country to Franklin. At this point US 62 enters the Allegheny River valley and follows this river for . US 62 crosses the river at Oil City, at Tionesta, and twice again in the Warren area, once near Buckaloons Recreational Area in the Allegheny Islands Wilderness region, where it is concurrent with US 6 for a short distance.

===New York===
While most of the route is an east–west route, US 62 takes a north–south directionality in Pennsylvania and New York. It is signed north–south in northern Pennsylvania and New York.

US 62 enters New York State from Pennsylvania in Chautauqua County, south of Frewsburg, past which it intersects with I-86 (Southern Tier Expressway). Following a northeasterly course, US 62 enters Cattaraugus County, crosses Cattaraugus Creek to enter Erie County and passes through the village of Gowanda, taking a more northerly direction. At the village of Hamburg, US 62 turns northeast, passing Buffalo Raceway and the Erie County Fair, New York State Thruway (I-90), continues northward through Lackawanna as South Park Avenue and passes through Buffalo as South Park Avenue and Bailey Avenue. The Bailey Avenue section from New York State Route 5 (NY 5) at the Buffalo city line to NY 324 is maintained by Erie County as County Road 152.

US 62 briefly overlaps NY 324 (Sheridan Drive) in the town of Amherst, and turns northward as Niagara Falls Boulevard, intersects I-290, then exits Erie County and enters Niagara County, as US 62 crosses the Erie Canal / Tonawanda Creek and travels into the town of Wheatfield. The highway intersects NY 425 and turns to the northwest intersecting NY 265 and I-190. On the east side of Niagara Falls the route diverges into US 62 and its parallel route, Business US 62, (formerly NY 62A). Within the city of Niagara Falls, US 62 runs &quot;backwards&quot;, bearing west for several miles as Ferry Avenue southbound (eastbound) and Walnut Avenue northbound (westbound) and terminates on Main Street, while is still signed north–south. The northern (eastern) terminus for both US 62 and Business US 62 is at NY 104 (Main Street), less than from the Rainbow Bridge and U.S. Customs. The Rainbow Bridge then crosses the Niagara River into Canada, offering side-views of the famous Niagara Falls.

In 2009, Legislation was proposed in the NY State Legislature for a bill (S.6277-A/A.9939-A) designating all of US Route 62 in New York State as the &quot;National Veterans Highway&quot;. The measure was sponsored by then Senator William Stachowski, and Assemblyperson Francine Delmonte as proposed by the Sons of the American Legion Post 880 as a way to salute and commemorate the service and sacrifice of all veterans of the US. The Bill was signed into law by Governor David Paterson on July 30, 2010. The designation runs from the Pennsylvania State Line south of Frewsburg, NY to a northern terminus near the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, NY. Designations have also been successful in Illinois and Kentucky to this point.

==Future==
In Ohio, there are plans to reroute US 62 onto a divided highway from Alliance to Salem, part of a larger relocation of both US 62 and SR 14, then from downtown Youngstown to I-80 as part of the &quot;Hubbard Arterial&quot;. Parts of the highway have long been completed to the north of Alliance and Salem; the portion northwest of Alliance is known in documents as US 62T, while the portion north of Salem not already carrying US 62 is known as SR 14T; neither carries a posted route, instead only carrying trailblazer markers indicating routes intersected at the termini.

<text>Giovanni Maria Artusi (c. 154018 August 1613) was an Italian music theorist, composer, and writer.

Artusi fiercely condemned the new musical innovations that defined the early Baroque style developing around 1600 in his treatise &quot;L&#x27;Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica&quot; [Artusi, or On the Imperfections of Modern Music]. He was also a scholar and cleric at the Congregation Santissimo Salvatore, Bologna, and remained throughout his life devoted to his teacher Gioseffo Zarlino (the principal music theorist of the late sixteenth century). When Vincenzo Galilei first attacked Zarlino in the &quot;Dialogo&quot; of 1581, it provoked Artusi to defend his teacher and the style he represented.

In 1600 and 1603, Artusi attacked the &quot;crudities&quot; and &quot;license&quot; shown in the works of a composer he initially refused to name (it was Claudio Monteverdi). Monteverdi replied in the introduction to his fifth book of madrigals (1605) with his discussion of the division of musical practice into two streams: what he called &quot;prima pratica&quot;, and &quot;seconda pratica&quot;: &quot;prima pratica&quot; being the previous polyphonic ideal of the sixteenth century, with flowing counterpoint, prepared dissonance, and equality of voices; and &quot;seconda pratica&quot; being the new style of monody and accompanied recitative, which emphasized soprano and bass voices, and in addition showed the beginnings of conscious functional tonality.

Artusi&#x27;s major contribution to the literature of music theory was his book on dissonance in counterpoint, &quot;L&#x27;Arte del contraponto&quot; (1598) He recognized that there could be more dissonance than consonance in a developed piece of counterpoint, and he attempted to enumerate the reasons and uses for the dissonances, for example as settings of words expressing sorrow, pain, longing, terror. Ironically, the usage of Monteverdi in the &quot;seconda pratica&quot; largely agreed with his book, at least conceptually; the differences between Monteverdi&#x27;s music and Artusi&#x27;s theory were in the importance of the different voices, and the exact intervals used in shaping the melodic line.

Artusi&#x27;s compositions were few, and in a conservative style: one book of canzonette for four voices (published in Venice in 1598) and &quot;Cantate Domino&quot; for eight voices (1599).

In 1993, Suzanne Cusick presented a feminist analysis of the Artusi controversy in which she asserted that Artusi&#x27;s attack on Monteverdi represented &quot;an attempt to discredit modern music as unnatural, feminine and feminizing of both its practitioners and its listeners&quot;. Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s and his brother&#x27;s replies, she claims, &quot;can be understood as a defense of the composer&#x27;s masculinity that acknowledges and reaffirms the femininity of the music itself&quot;. Other academics, such as Ilias Chrissochoidis and Charles S. Brauner, have challenged Cusick&#x27;s analysis as selective and incomplete: &quot;[A]nyone can project anything to the past for the purpose of legitimising one&#x27;s own set of values or even fixations&quot;.

<text>The Santee River is a river in South Carolina in the United States, and is long. The Santee and its tributaries provide the principal drainage for the coastal areas of southeastern South Carolina and navigation for the central coastal plain of South Carolina, emptying into the Atlantic Ocean about halfway between Myrtle Beach and Charleston near the community of McClellanville. The farthest headwaters are away on the Catawba River in North Carolina. Besides the Catawba, other principal rivers of the Santee watershed include the Congaree, Broad, Linville, Saluda and the Wateree. The watershed drains a large portion of the Piedmont regions of South and North Carolina. The Santee River is the second largest river on the eastern coast of the United States, second only to the Susquehanna River in drainage area and flow. Much of the upper river is impounded by the expansive, horn-shaped Lake Marion reservoir, formed by the -long Santee Dam. The dam was built during the Great Depression of the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project to provide a major source of hydroelectric power for the state of South Carolina.

==Description==
The Santee is formed in central South Carolina southeast of Columbia by the confluence of the rivers Wateree and Congaree. It flows southeast for before entering the northwest corner of Lake Marion, which stretches in a long wide arc to the southeast for approximately to Santee Dam. A navigable diversion canal first built during the 1970s at the southern end of the lake connects to Lake Moultrie, a reservoir on the nearby Cooper River. The modern canal is operated by the Santee Cooper agency as part of the larger hydroelectric project on both rivers. The dam was finished in 1941.

Downstream from the reservoir it flows east, then southeast, forming the northeast boundary of Francis Marion National Forest. Approximately from its mouth it bifurcates into two channels, named the North Santee and South Santee, that flow parallel and separated by approximately , creating Cedar Island. The two channels reach the ocean at Santee Point, approximately south of Georgetown, and not far from the outlet of the Pee Dee River.

==History==

The river was named by early English settlers for the Santee tribe, which inhabited areas on the middle part of the river. The first European contact was by a Spanish party commanded by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón in 1526. The early Spaniards may have named the river the &quot;Jordan&quot; (in honor of the Jordan River).

After suffering a defeat by the English and their allies during the Yamasee War in 1715–1716, the Santee were relocated. Many were shipped as slaves to the West Indies, opening the river for British settlement as part of the Province of Carolina. 

During the late 18th century, the upper river was the site of the homestead of Francis Marion, a patriot of the American Revolutionary War. The original site of his homestead has been flooded by the reservoir Lake Marion, which is named in his honor.

Construction of the -long Santee Canal, linking the river to the Cooper, was begun in 1793 and finished in 1800. It allowed direct water transportation between the upcountry of central South Carolina and the port city Charleston, at the outlet of the Cooper River. The canal operated for 50 years before being made obsolete by the introduction of railroads.

During the Great Depression, the state of South Carolina created the power utility Santee Cooper. The main source of electric power for the utility was a hydroelectric system inland from Charleston, built by the federal government during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Starting in 1939, the Santee River was dammed, forming lakes Marion and Moultrie, and diverting the river&#x27;s flow into the Cooper River through a hydroelectric plant at Pinopolis. The WPA project was completed in 1941.

Though the project succeeded in providing cheap electricity to modernize rural South Carolina, unintended consequences were changes to the character of both the Cooper and Santee rivers below the project. Deprived of most its water flow, the Santee River became more saline and its ecosystem gradually changed below the dam. The Cooper River received more of the freshwater and sediment loads that used to flow into the Santee and carried them downstream. This has resulted in greatly increasing the dredging costs to keep Charleston Harbor operating as a port. During the 1980s, the Army Corps of Engineers built a &quot;rediversion&quot; canal to send most of the water back into the Santee, partially mitigating this problem.

==Crossings==
This is a partial list of crossings of the Santee River.

<text>The Ozark Trail was a network of locally maintained roads and highways organized by the Ozark Trails Association that predated the United States federal highway system. The roads ran from St. Louis, Missouri, to El Paso, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, over a series of routes. These roads were maintained by both private citizens and local communities. In one case, however, the U.S. government was directly involved; it built the Newcastle Bridge in 1923 over the South Canadian River between Newcastle, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma City, as the first federal highway project built in Oklahoma.

These roads comprised the major highway system in the region until U.S. Highway 66 was built in the 1920s. In Oklahoma, portions of the section-line roads between Anadarko and Hobart are still referred to as &quot;The Old Ozark Trail.&quot;
==Route==

The Ozark Trails Association were a group of private citizens that tried to encourage local municipalities to build and maintain road systems in the Ozarks in the early 20th century. It was established in 1913. They erected large obelisks marking the various roads and indicated distances to various towns and communities. Twenty-one were constructed and of those only 7 still remain in existence, at Stroud, Oklahoma, Farwell, Dimmitt, Wellington, and Tulia, Texas. The Ozark Trail ran through southwest Missouri and across Oklahoma, the Texas panhandle, and on into New Mexico. Much of this route became the famed U.S. Route 66. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1925, which finally incorporated the Deep South into the Federal roads program, made the group&#x27;s basic functions obsolete and it disbanded.

William Hope &quot;Coin&quot; Harvey was closely associated with the organization.

<doc id="695391" wikidata="Q1340793" url="?curid=695391" title="Commercial software">
<text>Commercial software, or seldom payware, is a computer software that is produced for sale or that serves commercial purposes. Commercial software can be proprietary software or free and open-source software.

== Background and challenge ==
While software creation by programming is a time and labor-intensive process, comparable to the creation of physical goods, the reproduction, duplication and sharing of software as digital goods is in comparison disproportionately easy. No special machines or expensive additional resources are required, unlike almost all physical goods and products. Once the software is created it can be copied in infinite numbers, for almost zero cost, by anyone. This made commercialization of software for the mass market in the beginning of the computing era impossible. Unlike hardware, it was not seen as trade-able and commercialize-able good. Software was plainly shared for free (hacker culture) or distributed bundled with sold hardware, as part of the service to make the hardware usable for the customer.

Due to changes in the computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s, software slowly became a commercial good by itself. In 1969, IBM, under threat of antitrust litigation, led the industry change by starting to charge separately for (mainframe) software and services, and ceasing to supply source code. In 1983 binary software became copyrightable by the &quot;Apple vs. Franklin&quot; law decision, before only source code was copyrightable. Additionally, the growing availability of millions of computers based on the same microprocessor architecture created for the first time a compatible mass market worth and ready for binary retail software commercialization.

== Commercialization models for software ==

Common business wisdom is that software as digital good can be commercialized to the mass-market most successfully as proprietary good, meaning that the free sharing and copying of the users (&quot;software piracy&quot;) can be prevented. Control over this can be achieved by copyright which, along with contract law, software patents, and trade secrets, provides a legal basis for the software&#x27;s owner, the intellectual property (IP) holder, to establish exclusive rights on distribution and therefore commercialization. Technical mechanisms which try to enforce the exclusive distribution right are copy-protection mechanisms, often bound to the physical media (floppy disc, CD, etc.) of the software, and digital rights management (DRM) mechanisms which try to achieve the same also in physical media-less digital distribution of software.

When software is sold in binary form only (&quot;closed source&quot;) on the market, exclusive control over software derivatives and further development are additionally achieved. The reverse engineering reconstruction process of complex software from its binary form to its source code form, required for unauthorized third-party adaptation and development, is a burdensome and often impossible process. This creates another commercialization opportunity of software in source code form for a higher price, e.g. by licensing a game engine&#x27;s source code to another game developer for flexible use and adaptation.

This business model, also called &quot;research and development model&quot;, &quot;IP-rent model&quot; or &quot;proprietary software business model&quot;, was described by Craig Mundie of Microsoft in 2001 as follows: &quot;[C]ompanies and investors need to focus on business models that can be sustainable over the long term in the real world economy…. We emphatically remain committed to a model that protects the intellectual property rights in software and ensures the continued vitality of an independent software sector that generates revenue and will sustain ongoing research and development. This research and development model … based on the importance of intellectual property rights [was the] foundation in law that made it possible for companies to raise capital, take risks, focus on the long term, and create sustainable business models…. [A]n economic model that protects intellectual property and a business model that recoups research and development costs have shown repeatedly that they can create impressive economic benefits and distribute them very broadly.&quot;

=== Free and open-source software commercialization ===

While less common than commercial proprietary software, free and open-source software may also be commercial software in the free and open-source software (FOSS) domain. But unlike the proprietary model, commercialization is achieved in the FOSS commercialization model without limiting the users in their capability to share, reuse and duplicate software freely. This is a fact that the Free Software Foundation emphasizes, and is the basis of the Open Source Initiative.

Under a FOSS business model, software vendors may charge a fee for distribution and offer paid support and software customization services.
Proprietary software uses a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary software pays a fee for a license to use the software.
This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves.
Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee.
Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.
Free software is often available at no cost and can result in permanently lower costs compared to proprietary software.
With free software, businesses can fit software to their specific needs by changing the software themselves or by hiring programmers to modify it for them.
Free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone.
However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage.
Such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.

== Reception and impact ==
All or parts of software packages and services that support commerce are increasingly made available as FOSS software.
This includes products from Red Hat, Apple Inc., Huawei, Sun Microsystems, Google, and Microsoft.
Microsoft uses &quot;commercial software&quot;, to describe their business model but is also mostly proprietary.

A report by Standish Group says that adoption of open source has caused a drop in revenue to the proprietary software industry by about $60 billion per year.

<doc id="695395" wikidata="Q3486220" url="?curid=695395" title="Skeleton Crew (band)">
<text>Skeleton Crew was an American experimental rock and jazz group from 1982 to 1986, comprising core members Fred Frith and Tom Cora, with Zeena Parkins joining later. Best known for their live improvisation performances where they played various instruments simultaneously, they also recorded two studio albums &quot;Learn to Talk&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Country of Blinds&quot; (1986). The group drew on music and themes from a number of sources, including world music, left-wing politics and pre-recorded tapes.

Writing in the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot;, Lee Sherman described Skeleton Crew&#x27;s sound as &quot;unique and eclectic&quot;. In her 1990 book, &quot;Sonic Transports: New Frontiers in Our Music&quot;, Nicole V. Gagné called the group &quot;one of the hottest and imaginative rock acts I&#x27;ve ever heard.&quot; In 2021, Frith said Skeleton Crew&#x27;s stance was &quot;sorta kinda demented anti-industry and even anti-music&quot;.

==Biography==
After English guitarist Fred Frith&#x27;s New York City band, Massacre disbanded in mid-1981, Frith and American cellist Tom Cora decided to form a quartet with ex-Massacre drummer Fred Maher and American guitarist . But before their first performance, Maher and Schellenbaum both suffered collapsed lungs within two weeks of each other, leaving Frith and Cora with the choice of continuing on their own or abandoning the project. They chose to continue, agreeing to play all the instruments themselves during live performances. Frith played guitar, violin, keyboards, bass drum and hi-hat, while Cora played cello, bass guitar, homemade drums and other contraptions enabling him to play instruments with his feet.

Performing like this was a challenge for them and made the resulting music unpredictable, but as an improvising duo, this pleased them. It gave rise to a rhythmic tension not present in a group with just one drummer. Frith said in a 1983 interview, &quot;rhythmically, it throws up ways of playing that one person behind the drums just wouldn&#x27;t be able to do, just in terms of coordination.&quot; He told &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine in 1982: &quot;It&#x27;s all just on the edge of breaking down all the time, which is a quality that I&#x27;ve always liked. I don&#x27;t like things to be too easy.&quot; One critic wrote that Skeleton Crew&#x27;s performances were like a slowly sinking ship that somehow manages to return to port.

Gagné wrote that to make their live performances more challenging, Skeleton Crew played their roughly 50-minute sets with very few breaks, running most of their songs into one another. Gagné remarked that their sets were a blend of &quot;folk music, fake music, noise, political songs, taped events&quot;, and they &quot;kept the audience on its toes&quot; wondering what was coming next. But she added that what really had the crowds cheering was for the band&#x27;s &quot;amazing technique&quot;, and that they could go on for so long. Even when things occasionally went wrong for the duo, equipment malfunctions, missed cues, falling out-of-step with each other, Gagné said the audiences still enthusiastically spurred the band on.

Skeleton Crew&#x27;s first concert was at the M.A.K. Festival in Zürich in May 1982, but Frith and Cora asked Dave Newhouse of the Muffins to join them. Frith said &quot;we lost our nerve&quot; about whether we would be able to pull off our act as a duo, and we performed as a trio on our first tour. Newhouse left after the tour, but its success gave Frith and Cora the confidence to continue as a duo, and they performed over one hundred concerts in Europe, North America and Japan over the next eighteen months. In October 1983 they joined Duck and Cover, a commission from the Berlin Jazz Festival, for a performance in West Berlin, followed by another in February 1984 in East Berlin. In December 1983 Skeleton Crew performed at the 1st Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Victoriaville, Quebec, Canada.

Later in 1984, Skeleton Crew began work on their first studio album &quot;Learn to Talk&quot; in Switzerland. The LP (with sides named &quot;Side Free&quot; and &quot;Side Dirt&quot;) featured music that was both sparse and raw and consisted of cynical and humorous &quot;songs&quot; interspaced with cello, guitar and violin instrumental fragments. It conveyed the energy of their live performances. Tapes also featured throughout the album: Ronald Reagan saying &quot;We&#x27;re still free in America&quot;, cut-ups of Sousa&#x27;s &quot;Washington Post&quot; and TV ad clips. Tapes had also become a part of their live act.

By now, Skeleton Crew had become &quot;quite competent&quot; with their two one-man-band act. Later in 1984, Zeena Parkins, playing electric harp, keyboards and percussion, joined the band and remained until the end. As a trio, they made their second studio album &quot;The Country of Blinds&quot; in 1986 (again in Switzerland and produced by ex-Henry Cow member Tim Hodgkinson). Here the music was richer and more rhythmical than their first album. The songs were more developed but the cynical edge of the first album remained. Soon after the recording sessions the group decided to split up. Frith explained why:
:&quot;We actually started to sound like a normal rock and roll band so it seemed kind of pointless to go on at that point.&quot;

Frith and Cora re-united again as Skeleton Crew in 1995 in the Netherlands at the Koeinverhuurbdrijf Studio, Purmerland to record a CD-ROM &quot;Etymology&quot;, a sound sample library of sonic sounds and wire manipulations. In 2021, Frith assembled Skeleton Crew&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Free Dirt (Live)&quot;, a double-CD of material taken from concerts recorded in Europe and North America between 1982 and 1986. It was released by Austrian record label, Klanggalerie in December 2021.

<text>Third Person was an improvising trio formed in 1990 in New York City, led by cellist Tom Cora and drummer Samm Bennett. Each performance featured an invited guest: A third person. Guests included guitarist Marc Ribot, harpist Zeena Parkins, clarinet player Don Byron and saxophone players George Cartwright and Kazutoki Umezu and many others. 

The trio&#x27;s music was entirely improvised, but typically quite melodic, and even funky.

With Cora&#x27;s death in 1998, Third Person effectively dissolved.

<doc id="695403" wikidata="Q207987" url="?curid=695403" title="List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita">
<text>A country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita is the PPP value of all final goods and services produced within an economy in a given year, divided by the average (or mid-year) population for the same year. This is similar to nominal GDP per capita but adjusted for the cost of living in each country.

In 2023, the estimated average GDP per capita (PPP) of all of the countries was Int$22,452. For rankings regarding wealth, see list of countries by wealth per adult.

== Method ==

The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita figures on this page are derived from PPP calculations. Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.

Comparisons of national wealth are frequently made based on &quot;nominal&quot; GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (&quot;see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita&quot;); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.

This is why GDP (PPP) per capita is often considered one of the indicators of a country&#x27;s standard of living, although this can be problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income. (&quot;See Standard of living and GDP&quot;.)

GDP (PPP) and GDP (PPP) per capita are usually measured by international dollar, which is a hypothetical currency that has the same purchasing power in every economy as the U.S. dollar in the United States.

== Table ==
All figures are in current international dollars, and rounded to the nearest whole number.

&quot;The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available year&#x27;s estimates, and can be re-ranked by any of the sources.&quot;

* &quot;Nearly all country links in the table connect to articles titled &quot;Income in (&quot;country&quot; or &quot;territory&quot;)&quot; or to &quot;Economy of (&quot;country&quot; or &quot;territory&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

== Expanding the coverage of illegal economic activities in Euro area national accounts ==
The share of the shadow economy is significant in many European countries, ranging from less than 10 to over 40 per cent of GDP.
Since 2014, EU member states have been encouraged by Eurostat, the official statistics body, to include some illegal activities.

There are many natural economic reasons for GDP-per-capita to vary between jurisdictions (e.g. places rich in oil and gas tend to have high GDP-per-capita figures). However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data which produces artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures. It is estimated that over 15% of global jurisdictions are tax havens (see tax haven lists). An IMF investigation estimates that circa 40% of global foreign direct investment flows, which heavily influence the GDP of various jurisdictions, are described as &quot;phantom&quot; transactions.

In 2017, Ireland&#x27;s economic data became so distorted by U.S. multinational tax avoidance strategies (see leprechaun economics), also known as BEPS actions, that Ireland effectively abandoned GDP (and GNP) statistics as credible measures of its economy, and created a replacement statistic called modified gross national income (or GNI*). Ireland is one of the world&#x27;s largest corporate tax havens.

<doc id="695408" wikidata="Q282726" url="?curid=695408" title="Steve Bégin">
<text>Joseph Denis Stéphan Bégin (); born June 14, 1978) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played in 13 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons. He was a second-round selection of the Calgary Flames, 40th overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, and played with the Flames, Montreal Canadiens, Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins and Nashville Predators in his NHL career. After missing a full season due to injury, Bégin made a successful comeback by rejoining the Flames in 2012–13 before another injury forced his retirement.

Bégin played junior hockey with the Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs where he was a member of their Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) championship winning team in 1998. He also led the Saint John Flames to the American Hockey League (AHL)&#x27;s Calder Cup championship in 2001 and won the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs. Bégin adopted a role as a defensive specialist and grinder in an NHL career where he has played over 500 games.

==Personal life==
A native of Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Bégin grew up in a single parent household, raised by his father Gilles on a welfare income. Gilles worked as a landscaper, while Steve often helped his father at work until he was 18 years old.

Introduced to hockey by family friends, Bégin began playing at age six and was an offensively minded player in his minor hockey years. He wore second-hand equipment as his father struggled to pay the costs of hockey, but from a young age expressed his confidence he would make it to the National Hockey League (NHL). As a youth, he played in the 1992 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Francheville, Quebec.

Bégin moved to Val-d&#x27;Or, Quebec, to play junior hockey, where he met his wife, Amélie. The couple have two daughters and eventually settled in Montreal.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Bégin played three years for the Val-d&#x27;Or Foreurs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) between 1995 and 1998, where he scored 44 goals and recorded 117 points to go along with 520 penalty minutes in 157 games. The Calgary Flames selected him with their second round pick, 40th overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft. Following the 1996–97 QMJHL season, the Flames assigned Bégin to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Saint John Flames, with whom he recorded two assists in four playoff games.

Bégin earned a spot with the Calgary Flames to begin the 1997–98 season. He made his NHL debut on October 1, 1998, against the Detroit Red Wings, and appeared in five games before he was returned to Val-d&#x27;Or for the remainder of the season on October 28. The Foreurs went on to win the President&#x27;s Cup as QMJHL champions.

Bégin made his lone appearance with the Canadian national team that season, playing and serving as an alternate captain with the junior team at the 1998 World Junior Hockey Championship. He had no points and ten penalty minutes in seven games in what was an eighth-place finish for Canada.

===Calgary Flames===
After graduating from junior hockey, Bégin played his first full professional season with Saint John in 1998–99. He had 20 points and 156 penalty minutes in 73 games, and scored his first professional goal on October 8, 1998, against the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs. Bégin spent the majority of the next two seasons in Saint John, but made sporadic appearances with Calgary. He appeared in 13 games with the Flames in 1999–2000 and scored his first NHL goal on February 12, 2000, on goaltender Sean Burke of the Phoenix Coyotes. He played in four NHL games in 2000–01 while enjoying the best statistical season of his professional career in Saint John, scoring 28 points in 58 games. In the playoffs, Bégin led Saint John to the Calder Cup championship. He scored 17 points in 19 games and was named the recipient of the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs. His 17 points were fourth best in the AHL, and 10 goals were second.

Bégin played his first full NHL season in 2001–02, appearing in 53 games for the Flames where he scored 7 goals and 12 points to go along with 79 penalty minutes. He had 4 goals and 4 assists in 50 games for Calgary in 2002–03. He left Calgary in the off-season as he was part of a three team trade on July 3, 2003. Bégin was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres along with Chris Drury in exchange for Rhett Warrener and Steve Reinprecht, whom the Sabres acquired from the Colorado Avalanche to complete the deal.

===Montreal Canadiens===

Bégin was promoted by Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff as a hard working, &quot;blue collar&quot; type player that Sabres fans would enjoy watching, but he never played a game with the Sabres. He was exposed to the waiver draft prior to the start of the 2003–04 NHL season and claimed by the Montreal Canadiens. He played an energy role for the Canadiens, and scored 10 goals for Montreal in 52 games.

After playing through injury in 2003–04, Bégin underwent shoulder surgery that caused him to miss five months of playing time. When he returned to action, an ongoing labour dispute in the NHL led to his being assigned to the AHL&#x27;s Hamilton Bulldogs in February 2005, with whom he was immediately counted upon to play a leadership role. Bégin returned to the Canadiens in 2005–06 and set career highs in goals (11), points (23) and penalty minutes (113). The Montreal media named him the recipient of the Jacques-Beauchamp Molson Trophy, a team award given to a Canadiens&#x27; player who played a &quot;dominant role&quot; with the team, without earning any other honours. Plagued by injuries, Bégin missed time due to rib and shoulder injuries. He appeared in only 52 games in 2006–07 and 44 games in 2007–08 and scored 18 points combined over the two seasons.

===Dallas, Boston and Nashville===
Bégin was increasingly left out of the Canadiens&#x27; playing lineup in 2008–09, and after being sat out of the lineup for five consecutive games, expressed a desire to be traded if the team had no use for his services. The Canadiens obliged, completing a deal on February 26, 2009, that sent him to the Dallas Stars in exchange for defenceman Doug Janik. Stars&#x27; general manager Les Jackson promoted Bégin&#x27;s qualities as a checking-line forward: &quot;Steve is a gritty, honest player with a very strong work ethic. He&#x27;s good on the penalty kill and he is a competitor in every sense of the word.&quot; Bégin had 12 points in 62 games combined between Montreal and Dallas.

Leaving Dallas following the season, Bégin signed a one-year contract with the Boston Bruins for the 2009–10 season. He played in 77 games for Boston, the most of any single season in his career, and recorded 14 points. He scored his first career playoff goal, in his 30th playoff game, against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Bruins opted not to re-sign the 32-year-old Bégin, due both to their salary cap constraints and a desire to build a younger lineup.

Without a contract, Bégin remained a free agent as the 2010–11 season began. He eventually signed a one-year contract with the Nashville Predators on October 22, 2010, but was assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. Bégin spent the majority of the season in Milwaukee and appeared in only two games with Nashville.

===Return to Calgary===
Plagued by a hip injury, Bégin was again left a free agent prior to the 2011–12 season. He signed a professional tryout offer with the Vancouver Canucks, but was released by the team during the pre-season. Bob Hartley, coach of ZSC Lions in the Swiss National League A offered him a spot on their team. Though he had already scheduled surgery to repair his hip, Bégin was willing to put it off to play in Switzerland, but was convinced by Hartley to complete the procedure. His recovery prevented Bégin from playing anywhere during the season.
When Hartley took over as the Flames&#x27; head coach prior to the 2012–13 NHL season, he offered Bégin a tryout in Calgary. Bégin&#x27;s work ethic during the team&#x27;s training camp prior to the lockout-shortened season earned him a contract with the Flames, who believed he could serve as a penalty killer and energy player. Over two years since his last NHL game, Bégin returned to the league, and appeared in his 500th game on February 24, 2013, against the Coyotes. He appeared in 36 games for the Flames, scoring four goals and adding four assists. In recognition of his successful comeback, the Calgary chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association named him the Flames&#x27; nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and perseverance.

Bégin was signed to a one-year, AHL contract with the Abbotsford Heat for the 2013–14 season. He was unable to play due to another injury and, after doctors informed him that he would miss the entire season, Bégin announced his retirement from professional hockey on January 16, 2014.

==Playing style==
Bégin&#x27;s father taught his son that his best chance of making a career in hockey was as a defensive specialist and impressed on him the need for a strong work ethic. He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he said, &quot;What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot.&quot; That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: &quot;Players with the commitment of Steve Bégin, I really believe that there&#x27;s not enough (of them) in the NHL. I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. Pretty amazing what he&#x27;s done for us.&quot;

<text>A cave conservancy is a specialized land trust that primarily manages caves or karst features in the United States. Organizations that serve as cave management consultants to cave owners are usually considered cave conservancies. Almost all cave conservancies are non-profit organizations, but their management methodologies may be diverse. Cave conservancies often provide other services such as being advocates for responsible cave ownership and management, promoting the protection of caves, and advancing research to enhance and discover the values of caves.

==History==

===Cave management before 1963===

Historically, caves have been managed many different ways, from benign neglect to commercialization or other forms of exploitation with widely varying results. Some people saw commercial potential in caves and the development and profit provided the incentive for ownership and a form of conservation. The 19th century public interest in caves as natural curiosities may have led to the increased public awareness of their intrinsic value. This recognition played a part in some significant caves becoming protected through their inclusion in the US national park system. This became the first public attempt at managing and conserving caves in North America. Prior to 1968, there were no known non-profit cave conservancies. There have been some instances of individuals or families buying caves for access and conservation.

===Origins===
The Butler Cave Conservation Society (BCCS) established in 1968 was the first true cave conservancy. The National Speleological Society (NSS), when founded, was not intended to be a cave conservancy; however, it has acquired twelve cave properties, eleven by ownership, which it refers to as nature preserves. While it is probably not a cave conservancy according to the above definition, it is close enough to be considered a cave conservancy by some people. McFails, the first NSS Preserve, was donated to the NSS in 1967. Other land trusts, such as the Nature Conservancy, also own caves. These organizations, as mentioned above, are generally not considered cave conservancies, as the management of caves and other karst features are an incidental part of the purpose of the organization.

===Conservation in Virginia and the Northeast===
Many Virginia cavers were among the founders of the National Speleological Society. The same pattern was true as Virginia and northeast area cavers were in the forefront of the founding of the first four cave conservancies. This pattern continued for fifteen years after the founding of BCCS with the addition of three conservancies: the Appalachian Cave Conservancy (ACC), formerly the Perkins Cave Conservation and Management Society (PerCCAMS), 1977; Northeastern Cave Conservancy (NCC), 1978; and Cave Conservancy of the Virginias, 1980. CCV was founded with the intent of being a cave owning conservancy; however, leadership changes in its early history brought people with a different priority. Only recently has CCV come back to its original conservancy mission with the purchase of a significant cave property.

===The spread of conservation===

The cave conservancy movement spread to other parts of the country in the 1980s with the addition of Pennsylvania Cave Conservancy (PCC), 1983; Michigan Karst Conservancy (MKC), 1983; New Jersey Cave Conservancy (NJCC), 1984; Indiana Karst Conservancy (IKC), 1985; Texas Cave Management Association (TCMA), 1985; Ellis Cave Conservancy (ECC), 1985; and Greater Cincinnati Grotto - Great Saltpetre Preserve (GSP), 1989.

===The professionalization of Cave Conservancy===

The Southeastern Cave Conservancy Inc. (SCCI), 1991, established the most effective donation-based fundraising program to support cave acquisition. While the fundraising is done by volunteers, it is difficult to distinguish it from that of the fundraising of a professionally run organization. SCCI was the first conservancy to use re-occurring donations via donor credit cards. This funding method has become more common among conservancies.

The Texas Cave Conservancy (TCC), 1994, became the first to appoint a professional executive director.

===The move to orthodoxy===

The concept of having knowledgeable people managing caves has become widely accepted. New cave conservancies are expected to become a regular occurrence. Missouri Caves and Karst Conservancy (MCKC), 1995; Mid-Atlantic Karst Conservancy (MAKC), 1997; West Virginia Cave Conservancy (WVCC), 1997; Carroll Cave Conservancy (CCC), 1998; Karst Conservancy of Illinois (KCI), 1998; Cave Conservancy of Hawaii (CCH), 2002; and the Western Cave Conservancy (WCC), 2002 have been founded in a steady pattern of new cave conservancies.

==Movement growth==

A unique feature of American society is the extensive amount of volunteerism. Few other conservation societies have a comparable amount of volunteer activity and number and diversity of non-profit organizations in America. It is not surprising that cave conservancies would eventually be formed and that this movement would start in the United States. It appears driven by the twin factors of access and conservation. The environmental philosophy has provided the intellectual rationale to justify the importance of cave conservation and protection by conservancies. Cavers faced with the loss of access to caves due to land development and cave owners attempting to avoid some of the problems associated with visitation are some of the major reasons caves have been closed to cavers. Loss of cave access provides the emotional drive and support needed to motivate and encourage volunteer work and funding. The twin motivating factors of conservation and access drive the cave conservancy movement. Support for the movement also comes from people who envision the cave resource as a tool with which to educate for science and conservation. It is likely that more cave conservancies will be established and that the average number of caves managed by conservancies will increase.

==Accomplishments==

Cave conservancies now manage more than 115 properties with over of karst land and more than 230 caves that have a total or more than of cave passage.

==Leadership==

Currently, all cave conservancies are board managed. They fall into three types; the most common is an independent and either self-perpetuating or membership elected board. A few of these conservancy boards have a minority of members appointed by other organizations. The second most common type has all of its board members appointed by one or more organizations such as NSS grottos. The three conservancies that have this structure are GSP, PCC, and NJCC. Leaders in all three have reported some problems with this organizational structure. Only TCC has the staff run third type, in which the executive makes the management decisions. Conservancies are mostly volunteer organizations. Two conservancies have employees, TCC and CCV.

==Funding==
Cash-in-kind volunteerism is the primary source of wealth for most cave conservancies. Often, conservancy members have been the major contributors. Several such as BCCS, SCCI, and IKC have made extensive use of contributions from members. Dues, donations, major gifts, small fund raising events, raffles, and fees for services are the most widely used means of fundraising in addition to extensive volunteer time, which all cave conservancies receive in significant amounts. CCV is unique among cave conservancies in that it uses gaming as an effective fund raising tool. Establishing a gaming infrastructure is usually capital and labor-intensive accompanied with assorted risks. This form of funding is not likely to be used by most conservancies.

==Cave management control types==

The following is the sequence of cave protection levels used to classify the degree and type of control that conservancies have of a cave. This system suggests a sequence of cave protection strategies to use as appropriate in cave management situations. This method lists the six levels one should consider in order when deciding to protect, manage, and conserve a cave. 
SICLEO System.
# Enlightened Self-management by owner
# Informal management arrangement
# Contract
# Lease
# Conservation Easement
# Own
Each conservancy has a preferred management level. BCCS, SCCI, MKC, and CCH will usually choose cave ownership as the means to cave management. TCC and ACC are advocates for contract and leasing. NJCC has worked for years to lease the largest cave in New Jersey. CCV has devoted resources for many years to educate cave owners and, by implication, endorses enlightened self-management. IKC employs a varied approach using ownership, leasing, and conservation easement.

==Society naming conventions==

The first two conservancies were called societies, perhaps influenced by the name of the National Speleological Society. The second, PerCCAMS, and seventh, Texas Cave Management Association (TCMA), conservancies founded have the word &quot;management&quot; in their names. During that time, cave management was beginning to be recognized as a distinct activity and discipline. Even the NSS Conservation Section changed its name to include the word &quot;management&quot; in this era. Starting with the Northeastern Cave Conservancy, almost all cave conservancies have the word &quot;conservancy&quot; in their name, thus &quot;cave conservancy&quot; has been the standard name of the movement. Four conservancies, KCI, IKC, MKC, and MAKC have substituted the word &quot;karst&quot; for &quot;cave&quot;, perhaps to emphasize their interest in protecting/preserving the broader landscape. One conservancy, MCKC, uses both words apparently to make a point. One conservancy, PerCCAMS, has recently changed its name to ACC. Great Saltpeter Cave Preserve is the only NSS affiliated conservancy that has the type of name that is usually given to a property instead of an organization. Several other unaffiliated cave conservancies have a variety of names. Generally, cave and karst are interchangeable when naming organizations and not even the most dogmatic stickler for detail would maintain that a cave conservancy would be prevented from managing a karst feature because their name included the word &quot;cave&quot; and not &quot;karst&quot;.

==Cave conservancies and the NSS==

In 1986, Paul Stevens, NSS president at the time, and others foresaw the importance of cave conservancies and the role that the NSS could play in assisting the movement. They recommended to the NSS Board of Governors that they establish the designation of NSS Conservancy. Three conservancies were granted the cave conservancy designation within a year. They were the ECC, the only conservancy to date to disband; IKC; and TCMA. The cave conservancy function was placed in the NSS Department of the Secretary-Treasurer, over time assigned to a couple of different departments and committees. It was clear that the committee had greater potential as a separate unit. As part of the NSS reorganization promoted by NSS officers Fred Wefer, John 
M. Wilson, and Dave Luckins, the Cave Conservancies Committee (NSS CCC) was established as a separate entity in 1996 in the Cave Management Division of the Department of the Administrative Vice President. Since that time, most cave conservancies have chosen to use the NSS Cave Conservancy designation and /or participate on the conservancies committee. The committee functions as an informal association of cave conservancies, maintains an extensive website, provides a network of knowledgeable people available to assist conservancies in need, and hosts a meeting of cave conservancies at the NSS Convention each year.

As with land trusts in general, the cave conservancy movement in the United States is growing. It usually sets the standards for cave acquisition and management.

<doc id="695414" wikidata="Q3612357" url="?curid=695414" title="Red Alert (novel)">
<text>Red Alert is a 1958 novel by Peter George about nuclear war. The book provided the underlying narrative structure for Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot;. Kubrick&#x27;s film differs significantly from the novel in that the film is a black comedy.

Originally published in the UK as Two Hours to Doom, with George using the pseudonym &quot;Peter Bryant&quot; (Bryan Peters for the French translation, &quot;120 minutes pour sauver le monde&quot;), the novel deals with the apocalyptic threat of nuclear war and the almost absurd ease with which it can be triggered. A genre of such topical fiction, of which &quot;Red Alert&quot; was among the earliest examples that sprung up in the late 1950s, led by Nevil Shute&#x27;s &quot;On the Beach&quot;.

Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler&#x27;s later best-seller, &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;, so closely resembled &quot;Red Alert&quot; in its premise that George sued on the charge of copyright infringement, resulting in an out-of-court settlement. Both novels would go on to inspire very different films that would both be released in 1964 by the same studio (Columbia Pictures).

==Plot==
In a paranoid delusion, moribund U.S. Air Force general Quinten unilaterally launches an airborne preventive nuclear attack upon the Soviet Union from his command at the Sonora, Texas, Strategic Air Command (SAC) bomber base by ordering the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack using &quot;Wing Attack Plan R&quot;, an operational plan which authorises a lower-echelon SAC commander to retaliate after an enemy first strike has decapitated the U.S. government. He attacks with the entire B-52 bomber wing of new aircraft, each armed with two nuclear weapons and protected with electronic countermeasures to prevent the Soviets from shooting them down.

When the U.S. President and cabinet become aware the attack is underway, they assist the Soviet government in intercepting the rogue U.S. Air Force bombers, to little effect, because the Soviets destroy only two bombers and damage one, the &quot;Alabama Angel&quot;, which remains airborne and en route to its target.

The U.S. government reestablishes the SAC airbase chain of command, but the general who launched the attack, the only man knowing the recall code, kills himself before capture and interrogation. His executive officer correctly deduces the recall code from among the general&#x27;s desk pad doodles. The code is received by the surviving bomber aircraft, and they are successfully recalled, minutes before bombing their targets in the Soviet Union, save for the &quot;Alabama Angel&quot;, whose earlier-damaged radio prevents its recalling; it progresses to its target.

In a last effort to avert a Soviet–American nuclear war, the U.S. President offers the Soviet Premier the compensatory right to destroy Atlantic City, New Jersey; at the final moment, the &quot;Alabama Angel&quot; is shot down, and nuclear catastrophe is averted.

==&quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Fail Safe&quot;==
&quot;Red Alert&quot; author George collaborated on the &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; screenplay with Kubrick and satirist Terry Southern. &quot;Red Alert&quot; was more solemn than its film version and it did not include the character Dr. Strangelove, though the main plot and technical elements were quite similar. A novelisation of the actual film, rather than a reprint of the original novel, was published by George, based on an early draft in which aliens try to understand what happened after arriving at a wrecked Earth.

During the filming of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, Kubrick learned that &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although &quot;Fail Safe&quot; was to be a realistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot resemblance would damage his film&#x27;s box office potential, especially if &quot;Fail Safe&quot; were released first. Indeed, the novel &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; (on which the film is based) is so similar to &quot;Red Alert&quot; that Kubrick and Peter George sued on charges of copyright infringement. The case was settled out of court. What worried Kubrick most was that &quot;Fail Safe&quot; boasted acclaimed director Sidney Lumet and first-rate dramatic actors Henry Fonda as the American President and Walter Matthau as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into &quot;Fail Safe&quot;″s production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary &quot;Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove&quot;: &quot;We started casting. Fonda was already set... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter [Bernstein, the screenwriter] was set... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures.&quot;

Kubrick argued that &quot;Fail Safe&quot;″s own 1962 source novel, &quot;Fail-Safe&quot;, had been copied from &quot;Red Alert&quot;, to which Kubrick owned creative rights. He pointed out unmistakable similarities in intentions between the characters Groeteschele and Strangelove (although there is not a Strangelove character in the novel). The plan worked, and the suit was settled out of court, with the agreement that Columbia Pictures, which had financed and was distributing &quot;Strangelove&quot;, also buy &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, which had been an independently financed production. Kubrick insisted that the studio release his movie first, and &quot;Fail Safe&quot; opened eight months behind &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, to critical acclaim but mediocre ticket sales.

<text>The cephalosporins (sg. ) are a class of β-lactam antibiotics originally derived from the fungus &quot;Acremonium&quot;, which was previously known as &quot;Cephalosporium&quot;.

Together with cephamycins, they constitute a subgroup of β-lactam antibiotics called cephems. Cephalosporins were discovered in 1945, and first sold in 1964.

== Discovery ==
The aerobic mold which ed cephalosporin C was found in the sea near a sewage outfall in Su Siccu, by Cagliari harbour in Sardinia, by the Italian pharmacologist Giuseppe Brotzu in July 1945.

== Structure ==
Cephalosporin contains a 6-membered dihydrothiazine ring. Substitutions at position 3 generally affect pharmacology; substitutions at position 7 affect antibacterial activity, but these cases are not always true.

==Medical uses==
Cephalosporins can be indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of infections caused by bacteria susceptible to this particular form of antibiotic. First-generation cephalosporins are active predominantly against Gram-positive bacteria, such as &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus&quot;. They are therefore used mostly for skin and soft tissue infections and the prevention of hospital-acquired surgical infections. Successive generations of cephalosporins have increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria, albeit often with reduced activity against Gram-positive organisms.

The antibiotic may be used for patients who are allergic to penicillin due to the different β-lactam antibiotic structure. The drug is able to be excreted in the urine.

==Side effects==
Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (≥ 1% of patients) associated with the cephalosporin therapy include: diarrhea, nausea, rash, electrolyte disturbances, and pain and inflammation at injection site. Infrequent ADRs (0.1–1% of patients) include vomiting, headache, dizziness, oral and vaginal candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis, superinfection, eosinophilia, nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and fever.

=== Allergic hypersensitivity ===
The commonly quoted figure of 10% of patients with allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent &quot;safety first&quot; policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to all members of the group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins or carbapenems.

The contraindication, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral cefixime or cefuroxime and injectable cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, and cefradine should be avoided. A 2012 literature review similarly finds that the risk is negligible with third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. The risk with first-generation cephalosporins having similar R1 sidechains was also found to be overestimated, with the real value closer to 1%.

=== MTT side chain ===


Several cephalosporins are associated with hypoprothrombinemia and a disulfiram-like reaction with ethanol. These include latamoxef (moxalactam), cefmenoxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefmetazole, and cefotetan. This is thought to be due to the methylthiotetrazole side-chain of these cephalosporins, which blocks the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (likely causing hypothrombinemia) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (causing alcohol intolerance). Thus, consumption of alcohol after taking these cephalosporin orally or intravenously is contraindicated, and in severe cases can lead to death. The methylthiodioxotriazine sidechain found in ceftriaxone has a similar effect. Cephalosporins without these structural elements are believed to be safe with alcohol.

==Mechanism of action==
Cephalosporins are bactericidal and, like other β-lactam antibiotics, disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer forming the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity. The final transpeptidation step in the synthesis of the peptidoglycan is facilitated by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs bind to the D-Ala-D-Ala at the end of muropeptides (peptidoglycan precursors) to crosslink the peptidoglycan. Beta-lactam antibiotics mimic the D-Ala-D-Ala site, thereby irreversibly inhibiting PBP crosslinking of peptidoglycan.

==Resistance==
Resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics can involve either reduced affinity of existing PBP components or the acquisition of a supplementary β-lactam-insensitive PBP. Compared to other β-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins), they are less susceptible to β-lactamases. Currently, some &quot;Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae&quot;, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; strains are resistant to cephalosporins. Some &quot;Morganella morganii&quot;, &quot;Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; strains have also developed resistance to cephalosporins to varying degrees.

==Classification==
The cephalosporin nucleus can be modified to gain different properties. Cephalosporins are sometimes grouped into &quot;generations&quot; by their antimicrobial properties.

The first cephalosporins were designated first-generation cephalosporins, whereas, later, more extended-spectrum cephalosporins were classified as second-generation cephalosporins. Each newer generation has significantly greater Gram-negative antimicrobial properties than the preceding generation, in most cases with decreased activity against Gram-positive organisms. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, however, have true broad-spectrum activity.

The classification of cephalosporins into &quot;generations&quot; is commonly practised, although the exact categorization is often imprecise. For example, the fourth generation of cephalosporins is not recognized as such in Japan. In Japan, cefaclor is classed as a first-generation cephalosporin, though in the United States it is a second-generation one; and cefbuperazone, cefminox, and cefotetan are classed as second-generation cephalosporins.

=== First generation ===
Cefalotin, cefazolin, cefalexin, cefapirin, cefradine, and cefadroxil are drugs belonging to this group.

=== Second generation ===
Cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefprozil, and cefmetazole are classed as second-generation cephems.

=== Third generation ===

Ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime are classed as third-generation cephalosporins. Flomoxef and latamoxef are in a new, related class called oxacephems.

=== Fourth generation ===

Drugs included in this group are cefepime and cefpirome.

=== Further generations ===
Some state that cephalosporins can be divided into five or even six generations, although the usefulness of this organization system is of limited clinical relevance.

=== Naming ===

Most first-generation cephalosporins were originally spelled &quot;ceph-&quot; in English-speaking countries. This continues to be the preferred spelling in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, while European countries (including the United Kingdom) have adopted the International Nonproprietary Names, which are always spelled &quot;cef-&quot;. Newer first-generation cephalosporins and all cephalosporins of later generations are spelled &quot;cef-&quot;, even in the United States.

=== Activity ===
There exist bacteria which cannot be treated with cephalosporins of generations first through fourth:
* &quot;Listeria spp.&quot;
* Atypicals (including &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; and &quot;Chlamydia&quot;)
* MRSA
* Enterococci

Fifth-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftaroline) are effective against MRSA, &quot;Listeria&quot; &quot;spp.&quot;, and &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;.

=== Overview table ===

==History==

Cephalosporin compounds were first isolated from cultures of &quot;Acremonium strictum&quot; from a sewer in Sardinia in 1948 by Italian scientist Giuseppe Brotzu. He noticed these cultures produced substances that were effective against &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot;, the cause of typhoid fever, which had β-lactamase. Guy Newton and Edward Abraham at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at the University of Oxford isolated cephalosporin C. The cephalosporin nucleus, 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), was derived from cephalosporin C and proved to be analogous to the penicillin nucleus 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), but it was not sufficiently potent for clinical use. Modification of the 7-ACA side chains resulted in the development of useful antibiotic agents, and the first agent, cefalotin (cephalothin), was launched by Eli Lilly and Company in 1964.

<text>Yale Repertory Theatre at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut was founded by Robert Brustein, dean of Yale School of Drama, in 1966, with the goal of facilitating a meaningful collaboration between theatre professionals and talented students. In the process it has become one of the first distinguished regional theatres. Located at the edge of Yale&#x27;s main downtown campus, it occupies the former Calvary Baptist Church.

==History==
As head of Yale Repertory Theatre (&quot;the Rep&quot;) from 1966 to 1979, Robert Brustein brought professional actors to Yale each year to form a repertory company and nurtured notable new authors including Christopher Durang. Some successful works were transferred to commercial theaters. Michael Feingold was the first literary manager.

The dean of Yale School of Drama is the artistic director of the Yale Repertory Theatre, with Lloyd Richards (who most notably nurtured the career of August Wilson) serving in this capacity 1979–1991, Stan Wojewodski, Jr., 1991–2002, and James Bundy since 2002. Benjamin Mordecai served as managing director from 1982 to 1993. Victoria Nolan was managing director from 1993 to 2020. Her successor was Florie Seery.

Of the more than 90 world premieres the Rep has produced, four have won Pulitzer Prizes; ten productions have received Tony Awards after being transferred to Broadway, and Yale Repertory Theatre was given a Drama Desk Special Award in 1988 and the Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theatre in 1991.

In 2002, Yale School of Drama and Yale Repertory Theatre received the Governor&#x27;s Arts Award from Governor John G. Rowland for artistic achievement and contribution to the arts in the state of Connecticut.

The book &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot; by James Magruder covers the history of the Rep&#x27;s first fifty years.

==Calvary Baptist Church Building==
Calvary Baptist Church was erected in 1846 in the Gothic revival architectural style on a plot of land that was the original home of Richard Platt, one of the founders of New Haven. Upon redundancy, the church was controlled by Yale University, which was already served by a nondenominational chapel.

<text>Higher Learning is a 1995 American crime drama film written and directed by John Singleton and starring an ensemble cast. The film follows the changing lives of three incoming freshmen at the fictional Columbus University: Malik Williams (Omar Epps), a track star who struggles with academics; Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson), a shy and naive girl; and Remy (Michael Rapaport), a lonely and confused man seemingly out of place in his new environment.

The film also featured Tyra Banks&#x27; first performance in a theatrical film. Laurence Fishburne won an NAACP Image Award for &quot;Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture&quot;; Ice Cube was also nominated for the award. This was the last film appearance of Dedrick D. Gobert, who was shot dead in 1994 prior to the film&#x27;s release.

The exterior shots and outdoor scenes were shot on the campus of University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) while the interiors were shot at Sony Pictures Studios.

==Plot==
Kristen Connor, a friendly but naïve white woman from Orange County, California, and Malik Williams, a black high-school track star on an athletic scholarship, both incoming freshmen at the fictional Columbus University, attend a dorm party hosted by Fudge White, a militant Afrocentric activist who has been attending the university for 6 years. Fudge&#x27;s roommate Remy, a quiet white man from Boise (Idaho) and fellow freshman who is studying to become an engineer, contacts campus police to break up the party due to the loud rap music. Fudge argues that the police unfairly target black students while ignoring white students playing loud &quot;hillbilly music&quot;.

Taryn, an openly lesbian feminist junior, warns Kristen about walking alone at night on campus and invites her to join her student group. Meanwhile, Malik and Kristen both take a political science class taught by Maurice Phipps, a conservative black man from the British West Indies. Phipps assigns his students a semester-long project of formulating their own political ideologies instead of allowing others to categorize them.

A turning point occurs when frat boy Billy McDonald rapes Kristen, ignoring her refusal to have sex without a condom. Monet, Kristen&#x27;s roommate, discovers her crying and receives a racially offensive call from Billy; she then decides to seek help from Fudge, who recruits his friends to confront Billy at a frat party to severely assault him for the racist remark, and Kristen identifies Billy to the black students, who force him to apologize to Monet for racially insulting her during his phone call, unaware that he sexually assaulted Kristen. Shortly afterwards, Kristen joins Taryn&#x27;s student group, confiding in her about the rape, and Taryn encourages her to report the crime. As they grow closer, Kristen begins developing romantic feelings for Taryn. Eventually, Kristen decides to continue a relationship with Wayne, a college student and friend of Malik she was already dating before meeting Taryn.

When Remy criticizes Fudge&#x27;s habit of constantly disrupting his studies with loud music, Fudge mockingly threatens him. He moves out and gets a new Jewish roommate named David Isaacs, but his frustration grows when Malik mocks him after winning a video game. Shortly afterwards, feeling increasingly isolated from his peers at the University, Remy befriends a group of white supremacists led by Scott Moss, who live close to the Campus; influenced by their neo-nazi racist beliefs, he eventually joins their ranks as a Nazi skinhead.

After Malik confronts Phipps over a dismal grade on a midterm essay and accuses him of selling out to the white establishment, Phipps explains the various spelling and grammar errors and emphasizes the importance of taking personal responsibility. He shares with Malik his perspective that black people have to work twice as hard to triumph over societal prejudice and to attain the same socio-economic status as white people as well. Afterwards, Malik improves his writing skills with the help of his girlfriend, fellow track athlete Deja, and learns valuable lessons about self-improvement.

Conversely, Remy&#x27;s hatred and racism escalate as he pulls a gun on Malik and David, using racial slurs. He eventually drops out of the university and, encouraged by his Neo-Nazi friends, attacks with a sniper rifle from a rooftop during a peace festival organized by Kristen and Monet. Deja is killed and Malik finds and beats Remy before being himself violently restrained and beaten by the campus police, who ironically forget about Remy&#x27;s presence until he pulls a pistol. While suffering a nervous breakdown Remy tries to apologize for his actions, laments that he will never become an engineer, and (in a last effort to avoid further humiliation and imprisonment) commits suicide in front of Malik and the police by shooting himself in the mouth.

Later on at night, the racist skinheads gather in Scott Moss&#x27; apartment, eagerly waiting to hear news from Remy, while confident that there is nothing to connect the former to either Moss or his skinheads. The group then watch a TV news report of the university shooting and Remy&#x27;s death. The neonazis celebrate Remy&#x27;s actions, hailing him as a hero, making the nazi salute and loudly chanting &quot;white power&quot;, while Moss quietly sits back and slowly starts to smile.

In the aftermath of the shooting, Malik discusses his future with Phipps, explaining that he feels discouraged and unsure about continuing his studies after all that has happened. Phipps expresses trust in Malik&#x27;s judgment and future choice. Malik and Kristen, who have previously had minimal interaction with each other, have a conversation near a converted Christopher Columbus statue, reflecting on the recent events. While Kristen believes the shooting was her fault for organizing the peace festival, Malik reassures her that she is not to blame, and that it was the right thing to do at the time, before walking away from the campus, leaving his fate at the university undisclosed. The film concludes with Fudge, Taryn, and others graduating from Columbus University. The closing shot features Professor Phipps walking beneath the American flag, with the caption &quot;Unlearn&quot; superimposed over it.

==Reception ==
&quot;Higher Learning&quot; grossed $38,290,723 in the United States, with $20,200,000 in rentals. It ranked #44 for yearly domestic gross and #17 amongst R-rated films in 1995.

For their performances in &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, Laurence Fishburne and Ice Cube were nominated for the 1996 Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. Fishburne won.

===Critical response ===
The film received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert commended John Singleton&#x27;s direction of the film: &quot;He sees with a clear eye and a strong will, and is not persuaded by fashionable ideologies. His movies are thought-provoking because he uses familiar kinds of characters and then asks hard questions about them.&quot; He awarded the film three out of four stars.
&quot;Time Out&quot; wrote: &quot;A stylish, intelligent film-maker, Singleton interweaves the threads of his demographic tapestry with assurance, passion and a welcome awareness of the complexities of the college community&#x27;s contradictory impulses towards integration and separatism.&quot;
Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin felt that the movie fell short of its goal, saying it &quot;turns out to be an inadvertent example of the same small-mindedness it deplores&quot;.
&quot;Reel Film Reviews&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;consistently entertaining and well-acted all around. While it&#x27;s not a perfect movie – Cube&#x27;s character disappears for a 30-minute stretch and Singleton&#x27;s approach often veers into heavy-handedness – it is nevertheless an intriguing look at the differences between races and how such differences can clash&quot;, and awarded it 3.5 stars out of 4.

&quot;Higher Learning&quot; holds a 46% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states; &quot;It&#x27;s hard to fault &quot;Higher Learning&quot;″s goals; unfortunately, writer-director John Singleton too often struggles to fit his themes within a consistently engaging story.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 54% based on review from 20 critics.
Singleton commented: &quot;If you look at &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, which I was 25 years old making it, I&#x27;m like chock full of everything that would concern young people: lesbianism, and racism, and everything I could put in that movie. It was a great movie. A fun movie to do. But you could never get that movie made now. Never. The guy shoots everybody, know what I mean?&quot;

==Soundtrack ==

The soundtrack, containing hip hop, R&amp;B, rock and jazz music, was released on January 3, 1995 by John Singleton&#x27;s New Deal Music label through 550 Music/Epic Soundtrax. It peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 9 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.
In addition to &quot;Higher&quot;, performed by Ice Cube, the soundtrack includes original music by OutKast, Liz Phair, Tori Amos and Rage Against the Machine.

==Pop culture==
The character Malik, played by the same actor, Omar Epps, appears in &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot;, a comedy movie that parodied some popular black movies of the 1990s. A year later, after the graduation of a friend, Malik had returned to the university where he was shot and killed by a new Skinheads member.

<doc id="695436" wikidata="Q3314569" url="?curid=695436" title="Milwaukee County Stadium">
<text>Milwaukee County Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Opened in 1953, it was primarily a baseball park for Major League Baseball&#x27;s Milwaukee Braves and later the Milwaukee Brewers. It was also used for Green Bay Packers football games, ice skating, religious services, concerts, and other large events. Its final season was in 2000, when it was replaced by the adjacent Miller Park.

==Construction==
Milwaukee County Stadium was originally built as a home for the Milwaukee Brewers of the minor league American Association, replacing the outdated and deteriorating Borchert Field. Both locations would be influenced by the future Milwaukee County freeway system, as Borchert Field&#x27;s footprint would be cleared to make way for Interstate 43, with County Stadium located southwest of the interchange with the Stadium Freeway and Interstate 94.

Several locations around the city, including the Wisconsin State Fair Park in West Allis were considered before the city settled on the defunct site of the Story Quarry, on the west side of Milwaukee near the Story Hill neighborhood. County Stadium was the first ballpark in the United States financed with public funds. Construction began in October 1950 and, hampered by steel shortages during the Korean War, was completed in 1953. Construction cost was $5.9 million, with the bonds paid off in 1964.

The city of Milwaukee also hoped to use the new facility to attract a Major League Baseball franchise (the city had been considered a potential relocation target for years), and in this respect their efforts were immediately successful. In fact, the minor league Brewers would never get a chance to play at the new stadium.

==Major League Baseball==
===Milwaukee Braves (1953–1965)===
Even before it was completed, the new &quot;Milwaukee County Municipal Stadium&quot; drew the interest of major league clubs. The St. Louis Browns, who had played in Milwaukee in 1901, the inaugural season of the American League, applied for permission to relocate back to the city they had left half a century before. The Boston Braves, the parent club of the Brewers, blocked the proposed move. The Braves had long been struggling at the gate in Boston, and rumors of them relocating had been floating for some time. The move to keep Milwaukee available as a new home indicated to many observers that the Braves would move to Milwaukee themselves.
Three weeks before the beginning of the 1953 season, and right before the new stadium was ready to open, the Braves made it official, applying for permission to relocate. The other National League owners agreed, with the team becoming the Milwaukee Braves. The Braves&#x27; first regular season home game was on April 14 against the St. Louis Cardinals. Bill Bruton hit a 10th inning home run to win the game (3-2) in dramatic style. In their first season in Milwaukee, the Braves set the National League attendance record of 1.8 million.

The first published issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on August 16, 1954, featured County Stadium with Braves batter Eddie Mathews on its cover, along with New York Giants catcher Wes Westrum and home plate umpire Augie Donatelli.

On July 12, 1955, County Stadium hosted the 22nd All-Star Game. The National League won, 6–5, on a 12th-inning home run by Stan Musial. It hosted the first two editions of the Global World Series, an international baseball tournament, in 1955 and 1956; both editions were won by the United States. The Braves hosted back-to-back World Series in 1957 and 1958, both against the New York Yankees. The Braves defeated the Yankees in seven games in 1957, but the Yankees returned the favor the next year.

The stadium continued to be the National League&#x27;s top draw until 1959 when the Dodgers, who had moved to Los Angeles two years before, overtook the Braves (both in the stands and on the field). In the early 1960s attendance fell, along with the Braves&#x27; standings, amid an unstable ownership situation. The Milwaukee Braves used the stadium through the 1965 season when new owners, seeking a larger television market, moved the team to Atlanta.

===Chicago White Sox (1968–1969)===
In an effort to return Major League Baseball to Milwaukee after the departure of the Braves, local businessman and minority Braves owner Bud Selig brought other teams to play at County Stadium, beginning with a 1967 exhibition game between the Chicago White Sox and Minnesota Twins. The exhibition game attracted more than 51,000 spectators, so Selig&#x27;s group contracted with Sox owner Arthur Allyn to host nine Chicago White Sox home games at County Stadium in 1968.

Selig&#x27;s experiment was highly successful – those nine games drew 264,297 fans. Those games took place on May 15 vs. the California Angels, May 28 vs. the Baltimore Orioles, June 17 vs. the Cleveland Indians, June 24 vs. the Minnesota Twins, July 11 vs. the New York Yankees, July 22 vs. the Oakland A&#x27;s, August 2 vs. the Washington Senators, August 8 vs. the Boston Red Sox, and August 26 vs. the eventual World Series winners, the Detroit Tigers. In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 72 home dates. In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly &quot;one-third&quot; of the total attendance at White Sox games. In light of this success, Selig and Allyn agreed that County Stadium would host Sox home games again the next season.

In 1969, the Sox schedule in Milwaukee was expanded to include 11 home games (one against every other franchise in the American League at the time). Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year – over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did so at County Stadium (in the remaining 70 home dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 5,591 per game). Those games took place on April 23 vs. the California Angels, May 22 vs. the Detroit Tigers, May 28 vs. the New York Yankees, June 11 vs. the Cleveland Indians, June 16 vs. the Seattle Pilots (who eventually became the Brewers the next season), July 2 vs. the Minnesota Twins, July 7 vs. the Oakland A&#x27;s, August 6 vs. the Washington Senators, August 13 vs. the Boston Red Sox, September 1 vs. the Baltimore Orioles, and September 26 vs. the Kansas City Royals.

Selig was unable to attract an expansion team among the franchises awarded for the 1969 expansion. However, one of the teams founded in that expansion would later work in Selig&#x27;s favor.

===Milwaukee Brewers (1970–2000)===

Not discouraged by the setback, Selig instead bought the troubled Seattle Pilots out of bankruptcy court. The Pilots had been a 1969 expansion team. The Seattle franchise had serious stadium and financial issues. In the spring of 1970, Milwaukee had baseball again, and County Stadium had a new tenant.

The new Milwaukee Brewers, named for the American Association club for which County Stadium was originally built over 20 years earlier, called it home from 1970 to 2000. The sale occurred during spring training for 1970, and happened so fast that Selig could not get new uniforms made. Instead, they ripped the Pilots insignia off the pre-existing uniforms, and the Brewers adopted the Pilots&#x27; blue, white, and yellow instead of the red and navy blue (the Braves&#x27; colors) that Selig originally wanted; these remain the team colors to this day, despite changes to the shades over the years (and the brief addition of green as a tertiary color from 1994 to 1996).

On July 15, 1975, County Stadium hosted its second All-Star Game. As in 1955, the National League beat the American League, this time 6–3. With an attendance of 51,480, it was the largest crowd at the stadium at that time. The Brewers were represented by George Scott and Hank Aaron, who had recently returned to Milwaukee in a trade with the Braves.

Aaron spent the last two years of his career in Milwaukee and in the American League (where the Brewers played then; they would move to the National League in 1998), where the designated hitter position allowed him to extend his playing career. Aaron hit his final home run at County Stadium, giving him a career total of 755, establishing at the time the career home run record he first took from Babe Ruth in 1974. Aaron&#x27;s final home run took place in the 7th inning with a solo shot off California Angels right-hander Dick Drago on July 20, 1976, a game that the Brewers would win 6–2.

Before the Kansas City Royals were to play a game on June 12, 1977 against the Milwaukee Brewers at Milwaukee County Stadium, thieves stole gloves and uniforms belonging to Royals players. Due to this, all but seven Royals players had to wear Milwaukee road uniforms for the game played that day.

The Brewers won their first and only American League Championship by defeating the California Angels in five games in 1982, and hosted Games 3, 4 and 5 of the 1982 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.

==Replacement and demolition==

By the 1990s, County Stadium was considered outdated, lacking the amenities (most notably luxury boxes) that generated additional revenue for teams. On July 11, 1992, Selig announced plans for a publicly financed replacement to be built adjacent to County Stadium, opening in time for the 1994 season. In the meantime, a demonstration luxury box was built in the stadium in order to demonstrate the viability of one to local politicians and the city&#x27;s larger corporations. In addition, the stadium was the only one in MLB that lacked some sort of color videoboard (it used a monochrome Omega scoreboard built in 1980).

The new stadium funding plan proved to be extremely controversial, and it was not until 1996 that groundbreaking began on the new stadium, by now named Miller Park as part of a sponsorship deal with nearby Miller Brewing Company. Miller Park&#x27;s most distinctive new feature was a retractable roof, deemed essential to drawing fans during the cool and unpredictable Wisconsin spring. At the time of the groundbreaking, Miller Park was scheduled to open in 2000, making 1999 the final season in County Stadium.
The Brewers opened the 1999 season intending to bid farewell to their old park. On July 14, three construction workers at the Miller Park site were killed in the collapse of the site&#x27;s &quot;Big Blue&quot; crane while attempting to install a 400-ton roof panel. A good part of the construction site was also damaged as a result. Cleanup and an investigation delayed the closing of County Stadium to the end of the 2000 season. There was some talk of having the Brewers move into Miller Park in the middle of 2000, but it was determined that too many corners would have to be cut in order for it to be ready at that time.

The final major league game at County Stadium was on September 28, 2000; Warren Spahn threw out the first pitch to Del Crandall, and also in attendance were Willie Davis, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount. The Brewers were defeated by the Cincinnati Reds 8-1 in that game. After the game, there was a closing ceremony, where first home plate and the pitching rubber of County Stadium were removed, to be placed at Miller Park. Then, former Braves, Brewers, and Packers legends who had played at County Stadium during its history were introduced by broadcasters Earl Gillespie, Merle Harmon, and Bob Uecker, with Uecker delivering the closing speech, as each of the stadium&#x27;s light towers were symbolically turned off. The stadium was demolished on February 21, 2001. Although most of the stadium site is now covered with parking for Miller Park, the site of the old infield was converted into a Little League park, and is now called Helfaer Field. On a picnic concourse next to the playing field of Helfaer Field, there is an outline of where home plate was at County Stadium and also a bronze marker in the nearby parking lot marking where Hank Aaron&#x27;s 755th and final career home run landed.

Despite the stadium no longer existing, an abstract design of County Stadium is retained within Milwaukee&#x27;s city flag (along with a former Braves logo which has changed to represent Native American origins), whose replacement has been debated for the last two decades.

==Football==

===Green Bay Packers (1953–1994)===
The National Football League&#x27;s Green Bay Packers played two to four home games per year at Milwaukee County Stadium from 1953 to 1994, after using Wisconsin State Fair Park in nearby West Allis from 1934 through 1951 and Marquette Stadium in 1952. The Packers compiled a 76–47–3 () regular season record at County Stadium over 42 seasons. It hosted at least one pre-season game annually during this time as well (except 1983), including the Upper Midwest Shrine Game. Financial considerations prompted the Packers to move some of their games to Milwaukee starting with the 1933 season, with one game played at Borchert Field. By 1995, multiple renovations to Lambeau Field made it more lucrative for the Packers to play their full home slate in Green Bay again for the first time since 1932; according to Packers president Bob Harlan, the overall cost of hosting games at County Stadium was costing the team over $2 million a year. Former Milwaukee ticket holders were offered tickets at Lambeau to one pre-season game and games 3 and 6 of the regular season schedule (later changed to games 2 and 5), in what is referred to as the &quot;Gold package&quot;.

County Stadium was partly responsible for Lambeau Field&#x27;s existence. When it was originally built, it was not only intended to lure an MLB team to Milwaukee, but also to lure the Packers to Milwaukee full-time. As originally constructed, County Stadium was double the size of the Packers&#x27; then-home, City Stadium. By the 1950s, the Packers were under growing pressure to find a replacement for City Stadium. It could not be expanded, and its amenities for fans and players had long since fallen below NFL standards. With a growing number of teams letting it be known that they would not play at City Stadium, the NFL told the Packers to build a bigger stadium or move to Milwaukee full-time. Green Bay responded with a referendum that resulted in a new City Stadium, which opened in September 1957. After eight seasons, the venue was renamed &quot;Lambeau Field&quot; shortly after the death of team founder Curly Lambeau in 1965.

The Minnesota Vikings (15 times) were the Packers&#x27; most frequent foe at County Stadium, as the Packers would traditionally host at least one divisional rival from the NFC Central in Milwaukee each season. Only once, however, did the Packers play their ancient arch-rivals, the Chicago Bears, in a regular-season game in Milwaukee, defeating the Bears 20–3 in 1974. (The Packers and Bears played preseason games at County Stadium every year from 1959 to 1973, and again in 1975 and 1984; current NFL rules prohibit division rivals from playing each other during the preseason.) On November 26, 1989, a County Stadium record crowd of 55,892 saw the Packers beat the Vikings, 20–19. The Packers&#x27; final game at County Stadium was a 21–17 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on December 18, 1994; with fourteen seconds left, the winning 9-yard touchdown run was scored by quarterback Brett Favre, who was drafted by the Falcons in 1991 but traded the next year due to then-Atlanta coach Jerry Glanville&#x27;s intense dislike of Favre.

The Packers hosted one NFL playoff game at County Stadium, in 1967, defeating the Los Angeles Rams 28–7 in the Western Conference championship game, avenging a 27-24 loss two weeks earlier at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It was the first year that the NFL playoffs expanded to four teams, and Green Bay had home field advantage for both rounds, then awarded by rotation. Each subsequent playoff game has been played at Lambeau Field, starting with the Ice Bowl the following week against the Dallas Cowboys.

Unlike most publicly funded stadiums built in the 20th century, County Stadium was built primarily for baseball, creating issues for hosting football. The playing surface was just barely large enough to fit a football field, which ran parallel with the first base line. The south end zone spilled onto the warning track in right field, while the north end zone spilled into foul territory on the third-base side. Both teams shared the east sideline on the outfield side, separated by a piece of tape. At its height, it seated less than 56,000 for football—just over the NFL&#x27;s post-AFL merger minimum seating capacity—and many seats had obstructed views or were far from the field. Over the years, upgrades and seat expansions almost exclusively benefited the Braves and later the Brewers.

Season ticket prices (three games) for the first football season in 1953 were $5.00, $3.80, and $2.50. The average price in the final year of 1994 was $25.61 per game.

====Attempted AFL franchise====
Following the unsuccessful effort to lure the Packers to Milwaukee full-time, in 1965 city officials tried to lure an American Football League expansion team to play at County Stadium, but Packers head coach Vince Lombardi invoked the team&#x27;s exclusive lease as well as sign an extension to keep some home games in Milwaukee until 1976. Nonetheless, city officials still pursued an AFL franchise, possibly to play at Marquette Stadium, but the AFL–NFL merger effectively quashed any chances of Milwaukee landing its own team.

====Attempted CFL franchise====
In late 1994, Marvin Fishman purchased a stake in the corporation that owned the Las Vegas Posse of the Canadian Football League, with intent of moving the Posse to County Stadium, which would have required compromises in playing dimensions in order to be playable under CFL rules. Initially hoping to be held to the same revenue-sharing plan as the Packers had during their Milwaukee games, the Brewers unexpectedly objected, reasoning that unlike the Packers&#x27; two games that were usually outside of baseball season, the CFL played much of its schedule in the summer, meaning that several home games would cause scheduling conflicts with the Brewers and potentially damage the playing surface. Even after Fishman&#x27;s bid fell through and the Posse shifted its efforts to Jackson, Mississippi, CFL Commissioner Larry Smith continued to support a team for Milwaukee and County Stadium, a proposal that eventually ended after the CFL withdrew from the American market following the 1995 season.

===Marquette Golden Avalanche (1957–1958)===
Most of the home games of the Marquette University football team (7 of 9) in 1957 and 1958 were moved from Marquette Stadium to the larger County Stadium. The final home game on November 9, 1957 against Penn State drew less than 4,800 to County Stadium. Marquette football returned to Marquette Stadium in 1959 for its final two seasons.

===Milwaukee Panthers (1968–1971)===
The University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee football team played home games at County Stadium 1968–1971. It was one of multiple home venues for the Panthers after their on-campus stadium, Pearse Field, was razed for new development following the 1967 season.

==Other uses==

===Concert venue===
County Stadium was also a popular home for concerts throughout its history. Bob Hope performed for fans during a Braves doubleheader in 1960.

County Stadium also hosted the Kool Jazz Festival every year from 1976 through 1980.

Other musical stars who performed at County Stadium included Simon and Garfunkel, Pink Floyd, Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, Fleetwood Mac, Jimmy Buffett, Kenny Loggins, Peter Frampton, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, The Jacksons, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, B.B. King, Emmylou Harris, Nancy Wilson, The Staple Singers, Archie Bell and the Drells, Frankie Avalon, the Hollywood Argyles, Johnny and The Hurricanes, James Brown, The Famous Flames, Lobo, Bread, Andy Kim, Gary Puckett, Rare Earth &amp; The Honeycombs.

===Religious services===
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses held an annual convention (including well known annual themes such as: &quot;Good News for all Nations&quot; and &#x27;Peace on Earth&quot;) in the Stadium during the 1960s and 1970s, drawing as many as 57,000 people at a time. They later opted to utilize an &quot;Assembly Hall&quot;, which is constructed for the same purpose as the Stadium.

Billy Graham&#x27;s 1979 Wisconsin Crusade was also held at the Stadium.

===&quot;Coach&quot; (TV series)===
Portions of the last three seasons (1995–1997) of the American television series &quot;Coach&quot; were filmed at County Stadium. The series starred Craig T. Nelson as Hayden Fox, coach of the Orlando Breakers (a fictional NFL expansion team), from whose office window County Stadium can be recognized.

===Movie location===

The movie &quot;Major League&quot; was shot at County Stadium during the summer of 1988. Even though the movie was about the Cleveland Indians, producers cast Milwaukee Brewers radio announcer Bob Uecker in the movie, with signage for local channels WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) and WCGV-TV (Channel 24) not covered up and visible in the film. Announcements were made on local television news programs about the number of extras required for the day&#x27;s shooting, and capacity crowds turned out for the shooting of the final scenes, which involved the Indians in the final games of a pennant race. Also, in the film, fans in the stands are visible donning T-shirts bearing the name and logo of a local Milwaukee-area corporation, Quad Graphics (located in Sussex).

===International soccer===
On July 28, 1990, the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team hosted an international friendly vs. East Germany, losing 2-1.

===Rugby league===
On June 10, 1989, an exhibition game between the English teams the Wigan Warriors and the Warrington Wolves at County Stadium. Wigan would win 12-5, in front of a crowd of 17,773.

===Professional wrestling===
The World Wrestling Federation (now World Wrestling Entertainment) held &quot;WrestleFest 1988&quot; at County Stadium on July 31, 1988. The event was headlined by Hulk Hogan defeating André the Giant in a steel cage match.

===Ice Capades===
Due to the large seating capacity, in July 1953 the new stadium hosted the Ice Capades for nine consecutive nights.

==Unique features==
There was a chalet and giant beer mug, originally at right-center field and later at left, where mascot Bernie Brewer would &quot;dunk&quot; himself whenever a Brewers player hit a home run. The chalet is now stored at Lakefront Brewery, a Milwaukee microbrewery, and can be seen on brewery tours. County Stadium also gave rise to the Sausage Race, during which several anthropomorphized sausages participate in an initially fictional race to home plate between the sixth and seventh innings. Whoever finished first was the &quot;wiener&quot; and whoever finished last was the &quot;wurst&quot;.

Brats with Secret Stadium Sauce, invented and served at County Stadium, were the favorite ballpark food of sportscaster Bob Costas.

==Notable games==
County Stadium has hosted two Baseball All-Star Games, in 1955, when the National League Braves played host (and won 6–5 in 12 innings), and in 1975, when the then American League Brewers played host, and lost, 6–3. It also hosted the World Series in 1957, 1958 and 1982, as well as league playoffs in 1981, and a Green Bay Packers playoff game in 1967.

On May 26, 1959, Harvey Haddix of the Pittsburgh Pirates set a record as he pitched 12 perfect innings only to lose 1–0 to the Braves in the 13th inning.

On April 30, 1961, Willie Mays hit four homers and collected 8 RBI as the San Francisco Giants defeated the Braves, 14–8.

On May 1, 1975, Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth&#x27;s RBI record of 2211 by driving in his 2212th run at County Stadium as the Brewers beat the Detroit Tigers, 17-3.

On October 3, 1976, in the final game of his career, Aaron singled in his final at-bat for hit number 3,771. The hit drove in a run and set the Major League Baseball career RBI record of 2,297. In this final game, Aaron also set Major League records for that time with career game 3,298 and career at-bat 12,364. The Brewers lost to the Detroit Tigers, 5-2.

On October 10, 1982, the Brewers defeated the California Angels to win their first and only American League championship in franchise history. The Brewers defeated the Angels, 4-3, to win the ALCS three games to two.
On July 31, 1990, Nolan Ryan won his 300th Major League Baseball game at County Stadium when the Texas Rangers defeated the Brewers 11–3.

On September 14, 1991, Cecil Fielder of the Detroit Tigers hit the only home run to sail over the outfield bleachers and completely out of County Stadium. The blast came off Brewers&#x27; pitcher Dan Plesac. The Tigers beat the Brewers, 6-4.

On September 9, 1992, Robin Yount recorded his 3,000th hit in a Major League Baseball game at County Stadium.
===Final game===

The final game at County Stadium took place on September 28, 2000 in front of a capacity crowd of 56,354. The Brewers closed out their tenure at Milwaukee County Stadium with an 8-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, a ceremony aired in full on both WTMJ Radio and Midwest Sports Channel. Sean Casey of the Reds scored the last run at County Stadium with a single by Juan Castro, and the final hit was a single by the Reds&#x27; Michael Tucker. In a closing ceremony led by legendary announcer Bob Uecker, greats Braves, Brewers, and Green Bay Packers were introduced. Familiar faces such as Warren Spahn, Hank Aaron, Frank Torre, and Bob Buhl represented the Braves. Willie Wood and Fuzzy Thurston were some of the notable Packers. Brewers greats that came back to salute the fans and the stadium included Paul Molitor, Jim Gantner, Rollie Fingers and the widow of 1982 manager Harvey Kuenn. When Uecker announced what would be the final player introduction in the stadium, he began, &quot;his name is synonymous with the Brewers...&quot; Robin Yount then appeared from the left field fence on another Milwaukee legend, a Harley Davidson motorcycle. This was in honor of Yount&#x27;s famous entrance during the County Stadium celebration for the Brewers following the 1982 World Series, when Yount rode his Honda XR500 dirt bike (a bike which was not street-legal, but had been nonetheless used by Yount for the entire season) around the warning track, much to the delight of the fans. Following the introductions, Uecker read a short requiem for the old park as the lights were turned off, standard by standard. He closed with a version of this trademark broadcast sign-off &quot;...so-long old friend, and goodnight everybody.&quot;

==Capacity==
When it opened in 1953 it had 28,111 permanent seats and could hold up to 36,011 people. After an expansion one year later, the seating capacity was increased to 43,394. Subsequent expansions raised the baseball capacity to 53,192.

==Dimensions==

The stadium&#x27;s final dimensions were symmetrical:

<doc id="695438" wikidata="Q418546" url="?curid=695438" title="Aztreonam">
<text>Aztreonam, sold under the brand name Azactam among others, is an antibiotic used primarily to treat infections caused by gram-negative bacteria such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. This may include bone infections, endometritis, intra abdominal infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. It is given by intravenous or intramuscular injection or by inhalation.
Common side effects when given by injection include pain at the site of injection, vomiting, and rash. Common side effects when inhaled include wheezing, cough, and vomiting. Serious side effects include &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Those who are allergic to other β-lactam have a low rate of allergy to aztreonam. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. It is in the monobactam family of medications. Aztreonam inhibits cell wall synthesis by blocking peptidoglycan crosslinking to cause bacterial death.
Aztreonam was approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It was removed from the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines in 2019. It is available as a generic medication. It is a manufactured version of a chemical from the bacterium &quot;Chromobacterium violaceum&quot;. Aztreonam is available in a combination with avibactam (aztreonam/avibactam).

== Medical uses ==
Nebulized forms of aztreonam are used to treat infections that are complications of cystic fibrosis and are approved for such use in the EU and the US; they are also used off-label for non-CF bronchiectasis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mycobacterial disease, and to treat infections in people who have received lung transplants.

Aztreonam has strong activity against susceptible gram-negative bacteria, including &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. It is resistant to some beta-lactamases, but is inactivated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.

It has no useful activity against gram-positive bacteria or anaerobes. It is known to be effective against a wide range of bacteria including &quot;Citrobacter&quot;, &quot;Enterobacter&quot;, &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella&quot;, &quot;Proteus&quot;, and &quot;Serratia&quot; species. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility data for a few medically significant microorganisms.
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; 8 - &gt;128 μg/ml
* &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; 8 - 32 μg/ml
* &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; 8 - ≥128 μg/ml

=== Spectrum of activity ===
&quot;Acinetobacter anitratus&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, and &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; are generally susceptible to aztreonam, while some staphylococci, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus haemolyticus&quot; and &quot;Xanthomonas maltophilia&quot; are resistant to it. Furthermore, &quot;Aeromonas hydrophila&quot;, &quot;Citrobacter koseri&quot; (&quot;Citrobacter diversus&quot;), &quot;Pantoea agglomerans&quot; (&quot;Enterobacter agglomerans&quot;), &quot;Haemophilus&quot; spp. and &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; have developed resistance to aztreonam to varying degrees.

=== Administration ===
Aztreonam is poorly absorbed when given orally, so it must be administered as an intravenous or intramuscular injection (brand name Azactam), or inhaled (brand name Cayston) using an ultrasonic nebulizer. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the inhalation form in February 2010, for the suppression of &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; infections in people with cystic fibrosis. It received conditional approval for administration in Canada and the European Union in September 2009, and has been fully approved in Australia.

== Contraindications ==
Aztreonam can be safely used in people with a penicillin or cephalosporin allergy (except for people with a ceftazidime allergy as ceftazidime and aztreonam share a similar side chain). It is also frequently used as an alternative to aminoglycosides because is not ototoxic or nephrotoxic.

== Side effects ==
Reported side effects include injection site reactions, rash, and rarely toxic epidermal necrolysis. Gastrointestinal side effects generally include diarrhea and nausea and vomiting. Although &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection is a possible complication of aztreonam therapy, this antibiotic is associated with a low risk of developing &quot;C. difficile&quot; infection. There may be drug-induced eosinophilia. Because of the unfused beta-lactam ring there is somewhat lower cross-reactivity between aztreonam and many other beta-lactam antibiotics, and it may be safe to administer aztreonam to many patients with hypersensitivity (allergies) to penicillins and nearly all cephalosporins. There is a much lower risk of cross-sensitivity between aztreonam and other beta-lactam antibiotics than within other beta-lactam antibiotics. However, there is a higher chance of cross-sensitivity if a person is specifically allergic to ceftazidime, a cephalosporin. Aztreonam exhibits cross-sensitivity with ceftazidime due to a similar side chain.

== Mechanism of action ==
Aztreonam is similar in action to penicillin. It inhibits synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, by blocking peptidoglycan crosslinking. It has a very high affinity for penicillin-binding protein-3 and mild affinity for penicillin-binding protein-1a. Aztreonam binds the penicillin-binding proteins of Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria very poorly and is largely ineffective against them. Aztreonam is bactericidal, but less so than some of the cephalosporins.

== Research ==
Aztreonam is under consideration for human infections sustained by metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria. In these circumstances aztreonam is combined with ceftazidime/avibactam. The combination of aztreonam and avibactam are in phase III clinical trails. The combination of aztreonam and avibactam has demonstrated to be active against 80% of MBL isolates reaching a clinical infection resolution in 80% of MBL-infected patients.

Synergism between aztreonam and arbekacin or tobramycin against &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; has been suggested.

<text>Francis Ronald Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland (born 18 February 1940), known as Francis Ronald Egerton until 2000, is a British peer from the Egerton family.

==Family==
Sutherland is the son of Cyril Reginald Egerton, the grandson of Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere. His mother was Mary, daughter of Sir Ronald Campbell. Sutherland was educated at Eton and Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester (Gloucestershire).

==Career==
On 21 July 2000, Sutherland succeeded his first cousin once-removed as 7th Duke of Sutherland and 6th Earl of Ellesmere. Most of Sutherland&#x27;s wealth is in the form of the art collection put together by the first Duke&#x27;s uncle, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, which had been inherited by the Ellesmere line of the family. In 2008 he sold Titian&#x27;s &quot;Diana and Actaeon&quot; to the National Gallery of Scotland and National Gallery in London for £50 million.

He ranked 107th in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2009, with an estimated wealth of £480m in art and land, including Mertoun House and Stetchworth House. In the 2020 edition of the list, his net worth was estimated to be £585 million.

==Marriage and issue==
Sutherland married Victoria Mary Williams, born in Newbury on 21 June 1946, daughter of Major-General Alexander Williams and wife Sybilla Margaret Archdale, in Winterborne Monkton, Dorset, on 11 May 1974. They have two sons:
* James Granville Egerton, Marquess of Stafford 
* Lord Henry Alexander Egerton

<doc id="695450" wikidata="Q8047423" url="?curid=695450" title="David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University">
<text>The David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University is a graduate professional school of Yale University, located in New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in 1924 as the Department of Drama in the School of Fine Arts, the school provides training in every discipline of the theatre – acting, design (set design, costume design, lighting design, projection design, and sound design), directing, dramaturgy and dramatic criticism, playwriting, stage management, technical design and production, and theatre management. It was known as the Yale School of Drama until its endowment by David Geffen in 2021.

The school operates in partnership with the Yale Repertory Theatre, also located in New Haven.

==History==
The school traces its roots to the Yale Dramatic Association, the second-oldest college theatre association in the US, founded in 1900. The &quot;Dramat&quot; produced the American premieres of Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;Caligula&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, as well as original works by Cole Porter, Stephen Vincent Benét, and Thornton Wilder written when they were students.

In 1924, Yale benefactor Edward S. Harkness provided funds to the Department of Drama in the School of Fine Arts and for the construction of the University Theatre, later to become the school&#x27;s primary building. Completed in 1931, it was designed by Clarence H. Blackall and then later renovated by James Gamble Rogers. George Pierce Baker, a teacher of playwriting, was the first chairman of the department.

In 1955, the department was organized as a separate professional school, the first such in the Ivy League. In 1966, under Dean Robert Brustein, the Yale Repertory Theatre was formed to establish further ties between the professional and academic communities. Lloyd Richards, dean and artistic director from 1979 to 1991, increased the theatre&#x27;s emphasis on new plays, premiering works by Athol Fugard, Lee Blessing, and August Wilson. Richards&#x27; successor as dean and artistic director, Stan Wojewodski Jr., continued to emphasize the production of new plays, including several important works by Suzan-Lori Parks and Theatre de la Jeune Lune. The current dean and artistic director, James Bundy, has produced notable premieres by David Rabe, José Rivera, David Adjmi, and Sarah Ruhl, among others, as well as &quot;Radio Golf&quot;, the tenth play in August Wilson&#x27;s 20th century cycle.

==Facilities==

A variety of locations on the Yale University campus serve the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale. The University Theatre is a proscenium theatre that is shared with the undergraduate dramatic association and also houses the school&#x27;s main administrative offices. The Yale Repertory Theatre is located in the former building of the Calvary Baptist Church and contains an auditorium and the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale/Yale Repertory Theatre box office. Additional facilities include the Iseman Theater in Holcombe T. Green Jr. Hall, the School of Drama Annex, and the Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library.
==Academics==
===Admissions===
Admission to the school has been highly competitive for a long time. &quot;The Yale Herald&quot; reported that the school received 1,270 applications for the class of 1999 and admitted 68 applicants for an acceptance rate of 5.4%. In 2010, annual applications peaked at 1,520, with strict caps on admission to each of the school&#x27;s nine programs.

The cost of tuition for the 2020–21 academic year was $32,800. After his appointment in 2002, School Dean James Bundy made improving financial aid for students a priority. The school&#x27;s financial aid budget grew from $1.4 million to over $6.1 million in 2017, with significant reductions in debt upon graduation. Financial aid is awarded on the basis of financial need, with awards consisting of a combination of work-study employment, an educational loan, a tuition scholarship, and a living stipend. As of 2016, the average student with demonstrated financial need receives aid providing for 82 percent of the total cost of attendance.

In June 2021, Yale announced a $150 million donation from David Geffen that would permanently cover the costs of tuition for all admitted students.

===Enrollment===
As of fall 2015, there were 194 students enrolled at the School, 18% of which were international students.

===Degrees and certificates===
The David Geffen School of Drama at Yale offers a Master of Fine Arts in acting, design, sound design, directing, dramaturgy and dramatic criticism, playwriting, stage management, technical design and production, and theatre management. Students must hold an undergraduate degree and complete their program of study with distinction, which requires three years in residence. The school also offers a Doctor of Fine Arts to students who hold an M.F.A. degree in Dramaturgy and Dramatic Criticism and have written a dissertation approved by the D.F.A. committee.

A Certificate in Drama is available to those students who do not hold an undergraduate degree from an accredited college, but who are admitted and complete the same training as M.F.A. students. A Technical Internship Certificate is available to students who complete a one-year internship program of the Technical Design and Production department.

===Rankings===
The School has emerged as one of the nation&#x27;s best theatre conservatories.

==Student life==
===Activities===
Founded in 1968, the Yale Cabaret is an entirely student-run extracurricular activity that allows students to create productions of their own. It is the only production opportunity at the school that allows students to work outside of their discipline. Patricia Clarkson, Tony Shalhoub, Kate Burton, David Alan Grier, Christopher Durang, and Wendy Wasserstein, among countless others, all performed at the Cabaret.&quot;

==Notable people==
===Faculty===
Faculty members are working professionals in their fields and in many cases graduates of the school themselves. As of fall 2015, there are 79 faculty members. James Bundy is the current dean of the school as well as the artistic director of Yale Repertory Theatre.

Acting department faculty include Gregory Wallace, Ron Van Lieu, Erica Fae, Christopher Bayes, Cynthia Santos-DeCure, Tlaloc Rivas, Walton Wilson, and Tamilla Woodard, who also serves as chair of the program.

Directing department faculty include Emily Coates, Yuri Kordonsky, Robert Woodruff, and department chair Liz Diamond. Designers include Jane Greenwood, Jess Goldstein, Wendall K. Harrington, and Jennifer Tipton.

Playwrights include John Guare, Michael Korie, Lisa Kron, Tina Landau, Richard Nelson, Lynn Nottage, Peter Parnell, Adam Rapp, Paula Vogel, and Derek Walcott.

Critics include Allardyce Nicoll. Music consultants include Rusty Magee.

Former faculty includes dancer/choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, set designer Ming Cho Lee, actor Earle Gister and directors Robert Brustein, F. Curtis Canfield, Keith Fowler, and Nikos Psacharopoulos.

<text>Éric Bélanger (born December 16, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played the majority of his professional career as a centre in the National Hockey League (NHL), representing the Los Angeles Kings, Carolina Hurricanes, Atlanta Thrashers, Minnesota Wild, Washington Capitals, Phoenix Coyotes and Edmonton Oilers. He was originally drafted in the fourth round, 96th overall, in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by Los Angeles.

In 2021, Bélanger was named the first head coach the Trois-Rivières Lions, an expansion team in the ECHL affiliated with the Montreal Canadiens.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Bélanger played in the 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Orford, Quebec.

On March 3, 2010, the NHL trade deadline, Bélanger was traded to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. In Game 5 of the Capitals&#x27; 2010 playoff series against the Montreal Canadiens, Bélanger took a high stick to the mouth from Canadiens defenceman Marc-André Bergeron, which resulted in Bélanger losing nine teeth. Moments after the hit, the game telecast showed Bélanger on the bench removing a loose tooth from his mouth, using just his fingers and a piece of gauze.

Bélanger signed a three-year, $5.25 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers on July 1, 2011. In his first season in Edmonton, however, he set offensive career-lows, scoring just four goals and 12 assists, the lowest totals in both categories in his NHL career.

During the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Bélanger suffered a second successive disappointing year going without a goal in 26 games for the Oilers. On July 4, 2013, he was placed on unconditional waivers for a compliance buyout from the final year of his contract with the Oilers.

On July 15, 2013, Bélanger left the NHL and signed a one-year contract abroad in Russia with Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He played in just seven games with Avtomobilist in the 2013–14 season, before opting to return to North America and retire from professional hockey on September 25, 2013.

==Personal life==
Bélanger and Alexandra Morin have two daughters: Oceanne and Lola Pearl.

<doc id="695453" wikidata="Q6782344" url="?curid=695453" title="Masahiko Kobe">
<text>was a celebrity chef specializing in Italian cuisine, most notable as the &quot;Iron Chef Italian&quot; on the television series &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, where he appeared wearing a chef&#x27;s uniform decorated like the Italian Flag (green, white and red) and holding a tomato (in some episodes, an apple).

==Biography==
According to the &quot;Iron Chef&quot; storylines, Kobe was slated to be an Iron Chef in 1993, but was considered too young and immature. To fix this issue, he moved to Italy for about 4 years to train, becoming the fourth Iron Chef upon his arrival home. In reality, Kobe had little to do with the show before he moved to Italy (although he was aware of the show&#x27;s existence), and was asked to be on &quot;Iron Chef&quot; near the end of the four years.

Originally believing that he would be a challenger, Kobe found out that he was to be an Iron Chef mere days before his departure from Italy. Because of his quick turnaround from culinary apprentice to Iron Chef, Kobe is often considered to be a &quot;junior Iron Chef&quot;, having little experience compared to the other Iron Chefs.

Kobe, unlike his three fellow chefs, typically rises alone in Kitchen Stadium, many times accompanied by a group of violins playing &#x27;Stoning&#x27; by Sahashi Toshihiko. It was also to be noted that challenging chefs who were to face Kobe always had the fact explicitly mentioned during the challenger&#x27;s bio, something that was rarely done with the other three Iron Chefs.

Kobe, known as the &quot;Prince of Pasta&quot;, is the only Iron Chef to have lost his opening battle–with pasta as its theme. Out of concern for his apparent time mismanagement during the battle, subsequent battles he ran to the theme ingredient stand in the opening seconds (compared to his opponents who simply walked) in order for him to gain precious seconds that could be used for cooking. His tenure as an Iron Chef saw him battling in 24 battles, with a 16–7–1 record. He is also the only Iron Chef to lose a dessert battle, though he is one of three Iron Chefs to have never lost consecutive battles, nor did he lose against an Italian chef after his opening loss, going 7–0.

After &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, Kobe opened his own restaurant, the Ristorante Massa, in the Ebisu district of Tokyo, in 2000. In the post-series New York Battle special in 2000, he assisted Iron Chef French Hiroyuki Sakai in delivering a lecture on preparing salmon to students at the Culinary Institute of America.

He died on March 14, 2019, aged 49, from injuries sustained in a fall at one of his restaurants. One of his signature dish was trofies stuffed with chocolate.

<text>Víctor Manuel Zambrano (born August 6, 1975) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He played all or parts of seven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2001 to 2007.

==Professional career==
Zambrano had a good repertoire and an aggressive pitching approach, using his 92–95 mph sinking fastball, a changeup, and occasionally a quality slider. He was a converted infielder who fielded his position well and did a decent job holding on runners. However, his effectiveness was hampered by a lack of control.

===Minor leagues===
Zambrano was originally signed as a free agent by the New York Yankees in 1993. He started his professional career in 1994 with the GCL Yankees, but was released by the team prior to the 1996 season. He was signed by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, then spent the next several seasons working his way up through their minor league organization before making his major league debut in 2001.

===Major league career (2001–2007)===
In 2003, he led the American League in walks, wild pitches, and hit batsmen, and in walks again in 2004, despite being traded to the National League at midseason. The New York Mets acquired him, along with reliever Bartolomé Fortunato, in a highly criticized deal for top-ranked pitching prospect Scott Kazmir and minor league pitcher Joselo Diaz.

On May 6, 2006, Zambrano suffered a torn flexor tendon in his pitching elbow, disabling him for the rest of the 2006 season. Doctors unexpectedly found a torn elbow ligament during surgery on May 15, resulting in the second Tommy John elbow surgery of his career. Zambrano was expected to be sidelined well into the 2007 season, and he was non-tendered by the Mets, and became a free agent in December 2006.

On January 30, 2007, Zambrano signed a minor league contract, with an invitation to Major League spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays. He appeared in only eight games (two of them starts), before he was released on July 9. After signing a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, his contract was purchased by the Baltimore Orioles on September 9, 2007. For the rest of the 2007 season, he appeared in 5 games for the Orioles, made 2 starts, and was 0–1 with a 9.49 ERA. Following the 2007 season, he was released by the Orioles on October 1.

===Back to the minor leagues===
On February 5, 2008, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Colorado Rockies. On June 7, 2008, the Rockies released him. He signed with the New York Yankees on July 31, 2008 and became a free agent at the end of the season.

===Taiwan===
Zambrano began the 2009 season in the Mexican League with the Sultanes de Monterrey. After appearing in 16 games with the Sultanes, he signed La New Bears of Taiwan&#x27;s Chinese Professional Baseball League in August. He made his debut on September 1, pitching six innings with two earned runs. He lost to the Uni Lions&#x27; Nerio Rodríguez 9 to 5.

===Mexican League===
After the 2009 season ended and no team had picked Zambrano up, he decided to retire from baseball. He briefly attempted a comeback in the Mexican League in 2010 with the Dorados de Chihuahua, but was let go after appearing in eight games with an ERA of 7.02. He has not pitched professionally since.

==Personal life==
Victor has often mistakenly been thought to be related to former Chicago Cubs and Miami Marlins pitcher Carlos Zambrano. Both Carlos and Víctor Zambrano are Venezuelan. Although they lived just an hour away from each other as children, they never knew each other.

In October 2009, his mother was kidnapped. She was rescued three days later by members of the Venezuelan national police. Three suspects were arrested. A fourth is still at large.
