<doc id="696292" wikidata="Q5433591" url="?curid=696292" title="Fan clutch">
<text>A fan clutch is a thermostatic engine cooling fan that can freewheel at low temperatures when cooling is not needed, allowing the engine to warm up faster, relieving unnecessary load on the engine. As temperatures increase, the clutch engages so that the fan is driven by engine power and moves air to cool the engine.

==Function==
When the engine is cool or even at normal operating temperature, the fan clutch partially disengages the engine&#x27;s mechanically driven radiator cooling fan, generally located at the front of the water pump and driven by a belt and pulley connected to the engine&#x27;s crankshaft. This saves power, since the engine does not have to fully drive the fan.

However, if engine temperature rises above the clutch&#x27;s engagement temperature setting, the fan becomes fully engaged, thus drawing a higher volume of ambient air through the vehicle&#x27;s radiator, which in turn serves to maintain or lower the engine coolant temperature to an acceptable level.
Mechanical fans are most common in trucks and SUVs, and some RWD cars. This is easier to accomplish because the engine is mounted longitudinally, with the belt accessory components mounted facing the radiator. The fan is mounted on the crankshaft pulley or one of the accessory pulleys (e.g. the water pump pulley) and will spin in between the radiator and the engine, drawing air back through the radiator and blowing it over the engine. Even though the air has been heated by passing through the radiator, it is still much less hot than the engine surface, so the airflow over the engine helps with cooling.

In contrast, in a front-wheel drive vehicle, the engine is usually mounted laterally, with the crankshaft and typically all the major accessory shafts parallel to the front axle, so as to directly drive the transaxle; a fan mechanically mounted on an accessory pulley would blow sideways and would not face the radiator. This is why electric engine-cooling fans are used virtually universally in front-wheel drive vehicles. The conversion of mechanical energy to electricity and back to mechanical rotary power with a fan motor is less efficient than a direct mechanical connection, but this is more than compensated by greater control of an electric fan through electronic thermostatic controls which can turn the fan completely off when the engine temperature is below the setpoint.

==Types==
Most fan clutches are viscous or &quot;fluid&quot; couplings, combined with a bi-metallic sensory system similar to that in a thermostat. Some clutches are electronically controlled (instead of bi-metallic strip). These provide the potential to control the level of engagement depending on any number of inputs. Common controlling factors might include engine oil temperature, transmission oil temperature, coolant temperature, AC system pressures and ambient air temperature.

<text>The Metal Opera is the first full-length album by Tobias Sammet&#x27;s German supergroup project, Avantasia. It is a concept album and a metal opera. The album is followed by the sequel &quot;The Metal Opera Part II&quot;. Both were written over the course of a year, starting in the last quarter of 1998, and both were produced from October 1999 to June 2000, with the works being interrupted for some weeks so Sammet could produce &quot;The Savage Poetry&quot; with his other band Edguy.

The project claims that the album&#x27;s title marked the first usage of the term &quot;metal opera&quot;. Sammet also considers it his professional debut, since it marked the first time he actually made money from music, even though by that time he had already released three albums with Edguy.

According to Sammet, the album&#x27;s plot is partly based on real witch trials in Fulda (his hometown) and Mainz held in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In 2019, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; ranked it as the 25th best power metal album of all time. In 2021, they ranked it as the 18th best symphonic metal album.

==Track listing==
Note: &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; is sampled from the song, &quot;the Kingdom&quot;, by Tobias Sammet&#x27;s other project, Edguy.

<doc id="696312" wikidata="Q995805" url="?curid=696312" title="Falconer (band)">
<text>Falconer was a Swedish power metal band from Mjölby, formed in 1999 by the former guitarist of Mithotyn, Stefan Weinerhall. Falconer carried on many of the traditions set by Weinerhall&#x27;s previous band and played a fusion style of power metal that utilizes folk instrumentation and melody to create a more medieval sound.

== Biography ==
=== Origins ===

In 1992, the blackened death metal act Cerberus was founded by Stefan Weinerhall, Christian &quot;Christer&quot; Schütz and Johan, who left shortly afterward. After one year, they renamed themselves Mithotyn. As Mithotyn, they did not release an album until 1997. Much of the material featured on the three albums of their career were previously composed or featured on one of their previous demos such as the song &quot;The Guardian&quot; from &quot;Promo &#x27;96&quot;. The group released three albums: &quot;In the Sign of the Ravens&quot; (1997, Black Diamond Productions) followed by &quot;King of the Distant Forest&quot; (1998, Invasion Records), and finishing with &quot;Gathered Around the Oaken Table&quot; (1999, Invasion Records). Mithotyn officially dissolved in 1999.

Stefan Weinerhall, born 1976 in Mjölby, founded Falconer in 1999. He had planned to form a folk-influenced melodic metal band similar to his previous project, but with a focus on clean singing rather than harsh vocals. A demo was recorded using a drum machine and Swedish actor/singer Mathias Blad agreed to do vocals as a session member. After shopping the demo to labels, drummer Karsten Larsson (also ex-Mithotyn) was added to the lineup and Blad joined as a permanent member. Eventually, the band signed to Metal Blade Records. Weinerhall had played in the Viking metal band Mithotyn from their formation until their eventual split in 1999. He and his Mithotyn bandmate, Karl Beckman, made two albums with the black, thrash metal band Indungeon. Weinerhall played bass on the first album before switching to his more accustomed role as guitarist for their second album, The Misanthropocalypse. He wrote nearly all Falconer&#x27;s music and lyrics.

In November 2000, the band entered the Los Angered Recording (now Sonic Train Studios) with Andy LaRocque and Jacob Hansen behind the knobs. Their debut album &quot;Falconer&quot; was recorded in three weeks and was released in March in Europe and May in the United States. The album was met with critical success, and demand for live performances led to the addition of session members.

Falconer returned to Los Angered in November 2001. Nine tracks and one bonus track were recorded and mixed during the 24 days. In addition, the band licensed the album to Soundholic for Japanese distribution. The new album &quot;Chapters from a Vale Forlorn&quot; was released on 7 February in Japan and on 11 March in Europe and in the US.

=== Members ===
The band added Anders Johansson of Swedish band Vrävarna (not to be confused with the HammerFall drummer of the same name) and Peder Johansson on second guitar and bass, respectively, as live session members, and performed at Wacken Open Air, Rock Machina, and Bang Your Head Festival during the summer. Following these appearances, demand for live performances from the band increased considerably, and vocalist Mathias Blad, who could not commit to touring due to his acting career, agreed to amicably leave the band.

==== Line-up changes ====

;Mathias Blad
Blad is a Swedish actor and singer. was born in Motala. He studied musical-theatre at Balettakademien in Gothenburg between 1989–1992 and trained as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art between 1996 and 1999. He has worked extensively in Swedish theatre since 1992, where his work included playing Peter in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; at the Gothenburg Opera, Claude in &quot;Hair&quot; in Malmö, and Action in &quot;West Side Story&quot; at Värmlandsoperan. In 2018, he performed the role of Tempest in the Swedish musical recording of &quot;Tivolisaga&quot;, a musical by Johan Christher Schütz and Johan Pettersson based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

In 1999 Blad recorded demo vocals of the former Mithotyn guitarist, Stefan Weinerhall. After Weinerhall&#x27;s Falconer project was signed by Metal Blade Records, he agreed to stay on as a full-time member. Since Falconer was a studio band comprising only three members, there was no danger of touring opportunities clashing with his theatre work. This situation changed in 2002 when an expanded Falconer—now a fully rounded band of five people—were offered touring slots that the rest of the members wanted to pursue. At that time, Mathias amicably agreed to leave the band, having performed on two studio albums with them. After two albums with vocalist Göbel filling in, Weinerhall and drummer Karsten Larsson decided to approach Blad about a return to Falconer, which he agreed to. The band has since stated that live appearances may be infrequent due to Blad&#x27;s theatre commitments.

;Kristoffer Göbel
In November 2002, Karl Kristoffer Göbel (Swedish vocalist for Destiny) had been added to the line-up replacing Blad. Göbel was fired from the band before 2005 to make way for the returning Blad. He has since started a new band, &quot;Metal Für Alle&quot;, along with Snowy Shaw and his former Destiny bandmate Mikael Åberg.

;Other changes
Falconer returned to Los Angered to record &quot;The Sceptre of Deception&quot;, a concept album that, according to the band, is a mix between the two previous albums, but with some more unexpected turns in the music. The album featured multiple guest appearances, including backing vocals from former vocalist Mathias Blad and future Amaranthe vocalist Elize Ryd, as well as lead guitars from Andy LaRocque on the track &quot;Hear Me Pray.&quot; It was released on 6 October 2003.

Following the release of the album, internal difficulties brought on by problems with scheduling rehearsals arose within the band and both Anders and Peder Johansson were removed from the line-up. They were eventually replaced with Jimmy Hedlund and Magnus Linhardt, respectively. With this new line-up in place, Falconer recorded &quot;Grime vs. Grandeur&quot;, a record that departed quite significantly from their established sound by replacing the folk melodies, themes, and lyrics with more traditional heavy metal arrangements. The album received a generally muted response from fans as the band were seen to have lost their somewhat unusual identity.

=== Return to the roots ===
In November 2005, Göbel announced via the Falconer forum that he had been fired and that Mathias Blad had been re-hired in an effort to return to the band&#x27;s original sound. Recordings took place over the course of 2006, and a new album entitled &quot;Northwind&quot; was released in September of that year.

In an announcement on the official website on 21 April 2007, Stefan announced that Falconer had extended their deal with Metal Blade for four more albums. The album &quot;Among Beggars And Thieves&quot; was released in September 2008.

&quot;Armod&quot; was released on 3 June 2011. The album&#x27;s songs are all in Swedish. According to Weinerhall, &quot;The album is embracing the Swedish folk music to a greater extent than before making it sound slightly more down to earth. The music spans from acoustic songs with cello, flute and fiddle to songs with blast beats and really heavy riffing.&quot;

The following album, &quot;Black Moon Rising&quot;, was announced on 15 December 2013. It was revealed to be completed on 16 March 2014 and the album art and track listing were revealed one month later, on 16 April 2014.

In 2020, the band announced what would be their final album release prior to ultimately disbanding the band, &quot;From a Dying Ember&quot;. The band wanted to make this final album &quot;as good as we possibly could and really concentrate on having all Falconer elements present&quot;.

<text>Franz Bardon (1 December 1909 – 10 July 1958) was a Czech occultist and student and teacher of Hermetics.

==Life and death==
He was born in Troppau (Opava), Austrian Silesia. Bardon continued his work in the fields of Hermetics until 1958 when he was arrested and imprisoned in Brno, Czechoslovakia. Bardon died from pancreatitis on 10 July 1958 while in the custody of police.

== Works ==
Bardon is best known for his three volumes on Hermetic magic. These volumes are &quot;Initiation Into Hermetics&quot;, &quot;The Practice of Magical Evocation&quot; and &quot;The Key to the True Kabbalah&quot;.

An additional fourth work attributed to him by the title of &quot;Frabato the Magician&quot;, has been supposed by many of his students to be a disguised autobiography. Though the book lists its author as Bardon, it was actually written by his secretary, Otti Votavova. While some elements of the story are based on Bardon&#x27;s real life experience, most of the book was written as an occult novel with much embellishment on the part of Votavova.

Bardon&#x27;s works are most notable for their simplicity, their relatively small theoretical sections, and heavy emphasis on practice with many exercises. Students of his, such as Emil Stejnar, Walter Ogris, Martin Faulks, William Mistele and Rawn Clark consider him to have written the best training programs of any magician of the 20th century. They were written with the intention of allowing students who wished to practice magic the means to do so if they could not study under a teacher.

=== &quot;Initiation Into Hermetics&quot; ===
&quot;Initiation into Hermetics&quot; provides step-by-step instruction in the form of practical exercises. These exercises are aimed at developing body, soul and spirit. The result of the practical exercises is the development of occult abilities which can be of benefit to the student, in as far as changing his existence for the better.

Bardon&#x27;s training system is comprehensive. &quot;Initiation into Hermetics&quot; is divided into 10 practical steps. The program further subdivides each step into three areas – Non-being spirit or Mind (Spiritual abstract universal mental body; Soul as mental body into the astral, psychic and emotional body; the astral body and physical body – with the intent of developing all areas of the self simultaneously and in a balanced way. This is to ensure that the student maintain a balance of the three &quot;bodies&quot;, which accelerates progress in the long run and minimizes injury to oneself in the process of growth. Also, there occurs a purification of the personality, where the magician should become incapable of wishing harm to his fellow man. This is an important point since, as the power of the magician increases, so his ability to do harm – even unintentionally, increases. In summary—

#Mental exercises of the Spirit (or abstract mental being) begin with simply observing the mind and progress from there, with each subsequent exercise building on the previous. 
#Astral exercises of the Soul focus on systematically cataloging the positive and negative aspects of the self and, later, transforming and purifying the negative aspects into positives. 
#Physical exercises of the body stress physical health and development as well as the integration and use of the physical body and physical environment.

=== &quot;The Practice of Magical Evocation&quot; ===
&quot;The Practice of Magical Evocation&quot; is Franz Bardon&#x27;s second volume of The Holy Mysteries. In magical terms, the book is a practical guide to the proper evocation of and communication with divine entities existing in the atmospheric zones surrounding planets, stars, and moon as well as in the earth itself. It is a modern study of direct contact with the universal teachers – the other major works in the field are products of the Medieval, Renaissance, and Reformation periods. Beyond that it offers a glimpse into a complete magical universe. Bardon outlines a totally new and original hierarchy of magic, from the spirits of the four elements to those of the various planets, and even to each degree of the Zodiac. Included with the names and descriptions of the various entities are a collection of entirely unknown magical sigils, as well as an account of ancient Kabbalistic astrology.

Bardon&#x27;s second work, dealing with the evocation of spirits, outlined first the symbolic meaning of the traditional ritual tools and temple designs, then goes on to describe a method of evoking spirits. In essence, the magician creates an environment hospitable to the entity in the temple or other medium of contact. They then enter an altered state of consciousness through natural meditation, to deep fullness of ecstasy without substances or trance, projecting their consciousness into the sphere of the entity in question, and call it back. Bardon emphasized two points about doing this sort of thing: first, that one must complete the necessary prerequisites of the training program or no success was possible; secondly, that the magician must call the spirit back under their &quot;divine authority&quot;, not as a peer, otherwise they are liable to be manipulated by the entity.

=== &quot;The Key to the True Kabbalah&quot; ===
In &quot;The Key to the True Kabbalah&quot;, Bardon demonstrates that mysticism of letters and numbers – the &quot;true Kabbalah&quot; – is a universal teaching of great antiquity and depth. Throughout the ages, adepts of every time and place have achieved the highest levels of magical attainment through the understanding of sound, color, number and vibration as embodied in the Kabbalah. This book, the third in Bardon&#x27;s texts of Hermetic magic, is a practical guide to attainment.

The first two works, addressing the first two Tarots, are pre-requisite to understanding and making use of the third work. Bardon himself says that it is,
...quite up to the reader to study my books merely theoretically. In doing so, he will acquire a knowledge which he would not be able to get from any philosophical book. But knowledge is not yet wisdom. Knowledge depends on the development of the intellectual features of the spirit; wisdom, on the other side, necessitates the equable development of all four aspects of the spirit. Therefore knowledge is mere philosophy, which by itself alone can make a man neither a magician nor a Quabbalist. A learned man will be able to say a lot about magic, Quaballah, etc., but he will never be able to understand the powers and faculties rightly. With these few words I have explained to the reader the difference between the philosopher and the sage.
—Franz Bardon, &quot;The Key to The True Kaballah&quot;, 1975, pages 12–13

The idea is that the True Kabbalah is not a mantic art, as some perceptions of it (primarily relating to gematria) suggest, but a method of empowering the letters of the alphabet to create magical effects through their combination. Bardon links this to the Tantra of the East, but the basis of this comparison is not quite clear. Like his second book on evocation, the student must finish at least the first eight steps of IIH to get any valid results or have equivalent training in a different system and avoid damage to the psyche which &quot;...can cause a splitting of the personality, schizophrenia, with all its serious consequences.&quot; (Bardon, 1975, Page 55). Bardon expands on this real possibility with the following advice...

...someone who wants to apply the methods on the use of genuine kabbalah at once, out of mere curiosity or inconsiderateness, exposes himself to various dangers. For in practice he would get into contact with various powers which he would not be able to control and thus he would be in danger of ruining his health. Therefore, anyone not sufficiently prepared for this step is herewith warned in time.
 —&quot;The Key to The True Kaballah&quot;, Franz Bardon, copyright 1975, page 62

This damage to the psyche &quot;...clearly shows how inexcusable it is if writings of Oriental origin are interpreted incorrectly and translated literally in an intellectual language&quot; as Bardon has &quot;...put the greatest secret into the kabbalist&#x27;s hands, as in the practical application of the fourfold key, the key of realization by the word. Thousands of years this secret has been guarded.&quot; (Bardon, 1975, page 55 and page 112)

=== &quot;Frabato the Magician&quot; ===
&quot;Frabato the Magician&quot; is a novelised biography of Bardon written by his secretary Otti Votavova, though attributed to Bardon himself because he probably spoke about his preoccupations of life with her. The name of the protagonist, Frabato, was Bardon&#x27;s stage name during his career as a performing magician. Set in Dresden, Germany, in the early 1930s, the story describes Frabato&#x27;s magical battles with the members of a powerful and dangerous Black Lodge, his escape from Germany during the final days of the Weimar Republic, and the beginning of the spiritual mission which was to culminate in his writing a series of classic books on Hermetic magic. It also describes sinister occult forces which lay behind the rise of the Third Reich.

The essential and relevant part of the book is the revelation that Franz Bardon was the last reincarnation of the spirit embodied by Hermes Trismegistus, the esoteric creator of Hermeticism and the founder of Freemasonry, who, contrary to what Freemasons think, paid the karma that generated when he lived as Hermes Trismegistus, because the masonic idea of how the Laws of the Universe (the Law of God or Divine Justice) work, does not correspond to Bardon&#x27;s ideas.

The moral basis of Freemasonry is that the balance of good and bad actions is achieved if the mason compensates for his bad actions with good actions or &quot;vice versa&quot;, but decides what actions he will take to find the desired equilibrium, where it is the transgressor of the Universal Law who decides both what he will do and to whom he will do it. Hence, as the good deeds of Hermes did not serve as penance or payment of his karma to obtain forgiveness, it is God who forgives and decides the penance or karma to pay and when to apply it, Hermes paid his karma as Bardon. In order to be in harmony with the Universe, the transgressor must follow the norms that God imposes. Respect God&#x27;s laws and in case of sin repent, ask for forgiveness, and pay the penance or karma that God imposes in giving a choice when offering incarnation of the spirit in the next life.

In the edition published by Merkur, &quot;Wisdom of the Occident&quot;, Bardon&#x27;s secretary Votavova wrote an annex, &quot;In Memoriam&quot; where she refers to the characters embodying Bardon&#x27;s spirit as, among others: Hermes Trismegistos, Nostradamus, Lao Tse, Apollonius of Tyana, Robert Fludd, and Count Saint Germain. In his previous physical life he was a wise man (Mahatma) from the mountains named Mahum Ta-Tah, spelled like Ha-Khu-Ma-Na-Ta-Tah. Votavova also says that Bardon once told her that he embodied his own spiritual soul as a young boy between the ages of 14 and 21 and he was the one who decided to be the spiritual master of Victor Bardon, his own Father, who in his desire to become a divine initiate, asked -in his prayers- to know his true guru. The spirit of Bardon incarnated his only son, through an exchange of spirit (though unacceptable and impossible both from a spiritual and esoteric point of view).

<text>La risa en vacaciones is a Mexican comedy film series that has spawned eight sequels. The movies are popular in Mexico, Latin America and among the Hispanics of the United States.

&quot;La risa en vacaciones&quot; (&quot;Laughter on vacations&quot;) are movies where non-actors unwillingly participate. There are hidden cameras filming as people, mainly tourists, fall prey to pranks. These people, usually tourists, then have to sign a paper authorizing for their images to be used for the movie. Usually, the movies are shot in hotels, airports and fishing areas in Acapulco, Cancún or Cabo San Lucas, among other destinations. Three famous Mexican actors, who are identified in the movie only as &quot;Pedro&quot;, &quot;Pablo&quot; and &quot;Paco&quot;, appear in the movie as the pranksters.

Typical movie jokes usually involve the actors putting balloons on an unsuspecting woman&#x27;s dress, causing the back of the dress to flip up once she leaves her seat, or turning a public telephone upside down when a person is using it, making a toilet in a public restroom throw water back at the user, delivering the wrong food to a client at a hotel&#x27;s restaurant, telling awaiting passengers at an airport that their airplane has been designed to arrive at a different terminal, then have the passengers go back to their original terminal after announcing there has been &quot;another change&quot; and the plane will arrive in the same terminal they had been originally told to wait at, or &quot;Pedro&quot; pretending to be a homosexual and entering a men&#x27;s restroom where he would tell other men how much he &quot;admires&quot; their private parts.

Because of the complexity of some of their jokes (such as the restroom, restaurant and airport ones), they require full cooperation from hotel and airport management, as well as from their own movie technicians.

<doc id="696317" wikidata="Q997962" url="?curid=696317" title="Buchberger's algorithm">
<text>In the theory of multivariate polynomials, Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm is a method for transforming a given set of polynomials into a Gröbner basis, which is another set of polynomials that have the same common zeros and are more convenient for extracting information on these common zeros. It was introduced by Bruno Buchberger simultaneously with the definition of Gröbner bases. 

The Euclidean algorithm for computing the polynomial greatest common divisor is a special case of Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm restricted to polynomials of a single variable. Gaussian elimination of a system of linear equations is another special case where the degree of all polynomials equals one.

For other Gröbner basis algorithms, see .

== Algorithm ==
A crude version of this algorithm to find a basis for an ideal of a polynomial ring &quot;R&quot; proceeds as follows:

:Input A set of polynomials &quot;F&quot; that generates 
:Output A Gröbner basis &quot;G&quot; for 
:# &quot;G&quot; := &quot;F&quot;
:# For every &quot;fi&quot;, &quot;fj&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, denote by &quot;gi&quot; the leading term of &quot;fi&quot; with respect to the given monomial ordering, and by &quot;aij&quot; the least common multiple of &quot;gi&quot; and &quot;gj&quot;.
:# Choose two polynomials in &quot;G&quot; and let &quot;(Note that the leading terms here will cancel by construction)&quot;.
:# Reduce &quot;S&quot;&quot;ij&quot;, with the multivariate division algorithm relative to the set &quot;G&quot; until the result is not further reducible. If the result is non-zero, add it to &quot;G&quot;.
:# Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible pairs are considered, including those involving the new polynomials added in step 4.
:# Output &quot;G&quot;

The polynomial &quot;S&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is commonly referred to as the &quot;S&quot;-polynomial, where &quot;S&quot; refers to &quot;subtraction&quot; (Buchberger) or &quot;syzygy&quot; (others). The pair of polynomials with which it is associated is commonly referred to as critical pair.

There are numerous ways to improve this algorithm beyond what has been stated above. For example, one could reduce all the new elements of &quot;F&quot; relative to each other before adding them. If the leading terms of &quot;fi&quot; and &quot;fj&quot; share no variables in common, then &quot;Sij&quot; will &quot;always&quot; reduce to 0 (if we use only and for reduction), so we needn&#x27;t calculate it at all.

The algorithm terminates because it is consistently increasing the size of the monomial ideal generated by the leading terms of our set &quot;F&quot;, and Dickson&#x27;s lemma (or the Hilbert basis theorem) guarantees that any such ascending chain must eventually become constant.

== Complexity ==
The computational complexity of Buchberger&#x27;s algorithm is very difficult to estimate, because of the number of choices that may dramatically change the computation time. Nevertheless, T. W. Dubé has proved that the degrees of the elements of a reduced Gröbner basis are always bounded by
:formula_1,
where is the number of variables, and the maximal total degree of the input polynomials. This allows, in theory, to use linear algebra over the vector space of the polynomials of degree bounded by this value, for getting an algorithm of complexity
formula_2.

On the other hand, there are examples where the Gröbner basis contains elements of degree
:formula_3,
and the above upper bound of complexity is optimal. Nevertheless, such examples are extremely rare.

Since its discovery, many variants of Buchberger&#x27;s have been introduced to improve its efficiency. Faugère&#x27;s F4 and F5 algorithms are presently the most efficient algorithms for computing Gröbner bases, and allow to compute routinely Gröbner bases consisting of several hundreds of polynomials, having each several hundreds of terms and coefficients of several hundreds of digits.

<text>Gary Wilkinson (born 7 April 1966) is an English former professional snooker player.

== Career ==
Wilkinson turned professional in 1987. In 1988, he won the non-ranking WPBSA Invitation Event beating Alex Higgins 5–4 in the final. He climbed the rankings to reach the no. 5 spot in the world within four seasons. One of his career highlights was at the 1989 UK Championship, where he led John Parrott 7–0 and 8–1 in their Last 16 match before falling over the line at 9–6, then whitewashing Jimmy White 9–0 in the quarter-finals, and then leading world number 1 Steve Davis 4–0, 6–2 and 8–7 in the semi-finals, before Wilkinson misread the score thinking that Davis didn&#x27;t need snookers and went for a risky shot. It proved costly as Davis came back to get the snookers he needed, win that frame and then the deciding frame as Davis won 9–8. Wilkinson failed to sustain his late 1980s and early 1990s results and has never won a ranking tournament, losing in the final of the 1991 British Open 9–10 to Stephen Hendry, losing the 1992 Scottish Masters final 8–10 to Neal Foulds, as well as losing in four ranking semi-finals. While fancied to potentially go far at the 1991 World Championship, Wilkinson missed the chance of a 147 maximum break and a £100,000 prize in his first round match against Doug Mountjoy after missing the final yellow off its spot, and eventually lost 3–13 to Jimmy White in the quarter-finals in a surprisingly one-sided scoreline.

Wilkinson spent a decade in the top 32, but without reaching a ranking semi-final after 1992. He has made ten appearances in the World Championship, meaning that he has come through qualifying eight times. His best runs were to the quarter-finals in 1991 and 1995. After dropping off the main tour he played in the PIOS whilst also working as a tournament assistant for World Snooker. However, Wilkinson did capture one major title when he won the 1991 World Matchplay. During this peak moment of his career in December 1991, Wilkinson defeated Dean Reynolds 5–1, world champion John Parrott 9–8, Jimmy White 9–6 and then beat Steve Davis 18–11 in the final to win the 1991 World Matchplay title and the £70,000 winner&#x27;s cheque.

<text>Evocation is the act of evoking, calling upon, or summoning a spirit, demon, deity or other supernatural agents, in the Western mystery tradition. Conjuration also refers to a summoning, often by the use of a magical spell. The conjuration of the ghosts or spirits of the dead for the purpose of divination is called necromancy. Comparable practices exist in many religions and magical traditions and may employ the use of mind-altering substances with and without uttered word formulas.

==Conjuration==

In traditional and most contemporary usage, &quot;conjuration&quot; refers to a magical act of invoking spirits or using incantations or charms to cast magical spells. In the context of legerdemain, it may also refer to the performance of illusion or magic tricks for show. This article discusses mainly the original and primary usage, describing acts of a supernatural or paranormal nature.

Within some magical traditions today, such as Neopagan witchcraft, hoodoo and Hermeticism or ceremonial magic, conjuration may refer specifically to an act of calling or invoking deities and other spirits; or it may refer more generally to the casting of magic spells by a variety of techniques.

==In Western esotericism==

The Latin word &quot;evocatio&quot; was the &quot;calling forth&quot; or &quot;summoning away&quot; of a city&#x27;s tutelary deity. The ritual was conducted in a military setting either as a threat during a siege or as a result of surrender, and aimed at diverting the god&#x27;s favor from the opposing city to the Roman side, customarily with a promise of a better-endowed cult or a more lavish temple. &quot;Evocatio&quot; was thus a kind of ritual dodge to mitigate looting of sacred objects or images from shrines that would otherwise be sacrilegious or impious.

The calling forth of spirits was a relatively common practice in Neoplatonism, theurgy and other esoteric systems of antiquity. In contemporary western esotericism, the magic of the grimoires is frequently seen as the classical example of this idea. Manuals such as the &quot;Greater Key of Solomon the King&quot;, The &quot;Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (or &quot;Lemegeton&quot;), the &quot;Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot;.

<text>codice_1 is a Unix command used to dump the symbol table and their attributes from a binary executable file (including libraries, compiled object modules, shared-object files, and standalone executables).

The output from codice_2 distinguishes between various symbol types. For example, it differentiates between a function that is supplied by an object module and a function that is required by it. codice_2 is used as an aid for debugging, to help resolve problems arising from name conflicts and C++ name mangling, and to validate other parts of the toolchain.

This command is shipped with a number of later versions of Unix and similar operating systems including Plan 9. The GNU Project ships an implementation of codice_2 as part of the GNU Binutils package.

==nm output sample==
/*

 return 0;

If the previous code is compiled with the gcc C compiler, the output of the codice_2 command is the following:
# nm test.o
0000000a T global_function
00000025 T global_function2
00000004 C global_var
00000000 D global_var_init

00000036 T non_mangled_function
00000000 t static_function
00000000 b static_var
00000004 d static_var_init
When the C++ compiler is used, the output differs:

# nm test.o
0000000a T _Z15global_functioni
00000025 T _Z16global_function2v
00000004 b _ZL10static_var

00000000 B global_var
00000000 D global_var_init
0000003b T main
00000036 T non_mangled_function
The differences between the outputs also show an example of solving the name mangling problem by using extern &quot;C&quot; in C++ code.

<doc id="696326" wikidata="Q7179269" url="?curid=696326" title="Pett dynasty">
<text>The so-called Pett dynasty was a family of shipwrights who prospered in England between the 15th and 17th centuries. It was once said of the family that they were &quot;so knit together that the Devil himself could not discover them&quot;. This saying refers to the era during which Samuel Pepys was much involved in getting royal aid for Ann Pett, widow of Christopher Pett. The Petts Wood district of south-east London is named for the family.

==The Pett Family Tree==





==The four Peter Petts==
Peter Pett, Master Shipwright of Deptford, was granted a coat of arms in 1563. His son, Joseph Pett of Limehouse, succeeded his father as Master Shipwright before Peter&#x27;s death in 1605. Joseph surveyed the timber for the construction of a ship named &quot;Sovereign of the Seas,&quot; and married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Hoborn, another shipwright and churchwarden at Chatham. Joseph died in 1652, aged about 60. Joseph&#x27;s son, the second Peter Pett, carried on the private family business of shipbuilding at Wapping. Joseph&#x27;s other son, also named Joseph, became the master carpenter employed at Chatham in 1643 by the then Earl of Warwick.

Another son of the first Peter Pett was Richard Pett, who raised his son (Peter of Deptford (1593–1652) and the third Peter Pett) to be a shipwright. The sons of this Peter Pett were Phineas (a captain in the Royal Navy) and another Peter (the fourth).

This fourth Peter was baptised in St Nicholas&#x27; Church in 1630, and was later educated in St Paul&#x27;s School and Sidney Sussex College of Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1645. He then graduated to Pembroke College, Oxford, and in 1648 was elected to a fellowship at All Soul&#x27;s College. He was bachelor of civil law to Gray&#x27;s Inn from 1657 to 1658, and was knighted in 1661, after which he sat as a member of parliament for Askaeton in the Irish Parliament. He was called to the bar in 1664, as a barrister in law of the Middle Temple, and one of the original Fellows of the Royal Society in 1663, from which he was later expelled in 1675 for &quot;not performing his obligations to the society&quot;. He also became Advocate-General in Ireland, before his death in 1699. Peter was a learned author and many of his manuscripts have survived him.

==Phineas Pett, designer of the &quot;Sovereign of the Seas&quot;==
Phineas Pett succeeded shipwright John Holding in the post of keeper of the plank yard, but his income was meagre by the standards set by his family. In his diary, he recorded that it became his duty, for which he considered himself unfit, to take charge of the affairs of his &quot;poor sisters and brother.&quot; Phineas thought that his kinsman Joseph should have paid more attention to their plight, but he &quot;cared not what became of them&quot;.

The Autobiography of Phineas Pett indicates his pride in the coat of arms of his father Peter. Phineas&#x27; son Peter, commissioner of Chatham, was disgraced because of the Battle of Medway and the loss of capital ships almost 100 years later. These arms display three black balls rather than the three R&#x27;s of the Leicestershire Pates. The significance of the balls is made clear in some versions of this arms, which show below them a scuttled frigate. The lion passant shown on some versions indicates the Pett (Paetus (founders of Padua), Pettus) origins in Venice (colony of Padua), seafarer home of St. Mark, who is identified with a lion.

Peter Pett, in his application for arms, explicitly indicates his descent from Thomas Pett of Skipton.

==Joseph Pett of Limehouse, Master Shipwright==
As noted above, Joseph Pett of Limehouse became Master Shipwright in 1589, before his father Peter&#x27;s death. He was the father of Joseph Pett of Chatham and had another son, William, and a daughter, Lydia, who took up the trade of her father and is a rare example of a female master tradesman of the era. He was married twice, first to Margaret Curtis (who died in 1594), and later to Margaret Humphrey (who died in 1612). Joseph died in 1605.

<doc id="696343" wikidata="Q1057959" url="?curid=696343" title="Bachelor party">
<text>A bachelor party (in the United States), also known as a stag weekend, stag do or stag party (in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries, and Ireland), or a buck&#x27;s night (in Australia and Canada), is a party held for or arranged by a man who is shortly to enter marriage.
The party is usually planned by the groom&#x27;s friends or family.

The first references to Western stag nights in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; date to the 19th century. Traditionally, stag nights involved a black tie banquet hosted by the father of the groom that included a toast in honour of the groom and bride. Since the 1980s, some bachelor parties in the United States have involved vacationing to a foreign destination, or have featured female company such as strippers or topless waitresses.

==History==
The stag dates back as early as the 5th century B.C. The ancient Spartans celebrated the groom&#x27;s last night as a single man in which they held a dinner and made toasts on his behalf.

In 1896, Herbert Barnum Seeley, a grandson of P. T. Barnum, threw a stag party (known as the &quot;Awful Seeley Dinner&quot;) for his brother at the restaurant Sherry&#x27;s in New York City. The party had a dancer nicknamed &quot;Little Egypt&quot; who allegedly danced naked in desserts. The party was dissolved in the early morning by an officer. Afterwards, the Seeley family brought the police officer to the police board trial for &quot;conduct unbecoming to an officer of the law.&quot; At that time, that incident brought the light to the &quot;behind closed doors&quot; matters with bachelor parties.

The term &quot;bachelor&quot;, originally meaning &quot;a young knight-in-training&quot;, was first mentioned in the 14th century to refer to an unmarried man in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. In 1922, the term &quot;bachelor party&quot; was published in William Chambers&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Literature, Science and Arts&quot; and was described as a &quot;jolly old&quot; party.

==Variations==
The equivalent event for the bride-to-be is known as a bachelorette party (or hen night).

In Canada, some choose instead to hold a &quot;stag and doe&quot;, or a &quot;hag party&quot; or &quot;hag do&quot; in the UK (&quot;hag&quot; being a combination of the words &quot;hen&quot; and &quot;stag&quot;), in which both the bride and groom attend. These events may often provide an opportunity to fundraise for the wedding itself.

===Canada===
Canadian stag nights may extend into weekend affairs, sometimes involving travel to a cottage or cities around Canada, and occasionally Las Vegas as well. As in South Africa, the itinerary of a stag event is frequently kept hidden from the groom-to-be. The Australian terminology &#x27;buck&#x27; rather than &#x27;stag&#x27; is sometimes used.

In the province of Manitoba particularly, a &quot;social&quot; is often held rather than a stag and doe, in which the public are invited to attend a large evening party at a rented pub or event venue. Tickets are sold at the door or online, there is usually a cash bar and silent auction, and a traditional buffet of regional snack foods known as a &#x27;midnight lunch&#x27; will be served throughout the evening.

===Francosphere===
In France and in many French-speaking regions such as Quebec, the bachelor party is called &#x27;, which literally means &quot;(the) burial of the life as a boy&quot; or &quot;burial/funeral of the life as a bachelor&quot;. For women it is &#x27;, translated as &quot;burial/funeral of the life as a young girl/maiden&quot;. Bachelor parties were known as early as the 1830s, when in the Charpennes neighborhood of Lyon groups of young men would dine at the restaurant of La Mere Brigousse on her famous dish of enormous dumplings &quot;les tétons de Vénus&quot; (Venus&#x27;s breasts).

===Germany===
In Germany, this event is called &quot;Junggesellenabschied&quot;, which literally means &quot;bachelor farewell&quot;. There is also a separate event that the couple celebrates together on the evening prior to their wedding, called &quot;Polterabend&quot;. At the Polterabend, the guests break old porcelain and earthenware to bring luck to the couple&#x27;s marriage. The tradition is said to go back to pre-Christian times; by noisily breaking ceramics, evil spirits – especially spirits of envy – are supposed to be driven out. In the last couple of years, Anglo-style bachelor parties have become more and more popular among bachelors. In parts of northern Germany that lack a Carnival tradition, funny costuming has become a popular part of bachelor or bachelorette parties.

Some parts of Germany have a related custom, in which a person who is not yet married by their 30th birthday, is made to dress up in an embarrassing fashion by their friends and to do silly tasks that most often include some kind of cleaning work.

===Israel===
In Israel, the bachelors party is called &quot;&quot; (mesibat ravakim), literally meaning bachelor party. Such parties may feature heavy drinking and sometimes the presence of strippers, or else other recreational bonding activities undertaken together, such as paintball or an overseas trip lasting a few days.

===South Africa===
Bachelor parties in South Africa are expected to be a surprise, which is a unique regional variant. The party is planned without the groom&#x27;s knowledge and is typically a couple days before the wedding. A bachelor party can include many family members and friends, and it isn&#x27;t limited to the wedding party. It often includes a traditional braai.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden bachelor parties are known as &quot;Svensexa&quot;. They are documented since the 17th century; it is believed the tradition began with the bachelorette party, &quot;Möhippa&quot;, which was then followed by a male version. The parties were first called S&quot;venafton&quot;, meaning &quot;Sven&#x27;s Eve&quot;. Sven is a Swedish first name, meaning &quot;young man&quot; and also used in connection with male virginity. The parties were disliked by the church as they involved heavy drinking and the participants would show up to the wedding hung over or drunk. In the 19th century it was reformed by the bourgeoisie, and it became known as S&quot;vensexa&quot;, where &quot;sexa&quot; was a new word for a late-night party with dinner and alcohol that started at six o&#x27;clock with drinks and snacks. There were no activities at Swedish bachelor parties, other than food and alcohol, until the 1960s or 1970s. Since then they have developed to full-day or weekend events, traditionally starting with a kidnapping followed by activities that might involve humiliation of the bachelor. They are usually not held the day before the wedding, but a few weekends before.

=== Thailand ===
Bachelor parties in Thailand became increasingly popular after huge success of &quot;The Hangover 2&quot;, which was filmed and based in Bangkok.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
Pranks are a long-standing feature of stag parties in the UK and Ireland.

In the United Kingdom, it is now common for the party to last for more than one evening, hence the increasing prevalence of the phrase &quot;stag weekend&quot;, or &quot;stag do&quot;. A spin-off has been the growth of the stag weekend industry in the UK with various companies taking over the preparation of the event.

In the UK, stag weekend trips are becoming mini-holidays with the groups taking part in various day-time activities as well as the expected night out or pub crawl around the place in which they are staying. They may involve travelling to another location in the UK or going abroad, with Kraków, Dublin, and Riga topping the list, followed by Prague, Amsterdam, Bratislava, and Budapest. Stag parties abroad have been known to involve visits to brothels and prostitutes, although this is in the minority of cases.

===United States===
In the United States, Las Vegas is both a popular bachelor party destination and location for the wedding itself. Increasingly, &quot;destination bachelor parties&quot; are replacing standard nights out, with Americans traveling to Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, or abroad to Mexico.

Bachelor parties in the US stereotypically entail the mass consumption of alcohol, hiring a stripper, and general rowdiness to which the bride might not have a positive reaction; in fact, the defining feature of the bachelor party is that the fiancée is not present. Increasingly, bachelor parties have come to symbolize the last time that the groom is free from the influence of his new wife/partner. Pop out cakes are sometimes associated.

<text>The Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (LPI RAS or just LPI) (in ), situated in Moscow, is a Russian research institute specializing in physics. The institute was established in its present shape in 1934 by academician Sergey Vavilov. It moved to Moscow and was named after a Russian physicist Pyotr Lebedev the same year. It is also known as P. N. Lebedev Institute of Physics or just Lebedev Institute. In Russian it is often referred to by the acronym FIAN (ФИАН) standing for &quot;Physical Institute of the Academy of Sciences&quot;. The range of the research activities includes: laser technology, dark matter structure, nanostructures, superconductivity, cosmic rays, and gamma-astronomy. The institute developed a technique of crystallizing cubic zirconia (which was called &quot;Fianit&quot; in Russia, named after FIAN).

==Directors of the Institute==
# Sergey Vavilov (1934–1951)
# Dmitri Skobeltsyn (1951–1972)
# Nikolay Basov (1973–1988)
# Leonid Keldysh (1988–1994)
# Oleg Krokhin (1994–2004)
# Gennady Mesyats (2004–2015)
# (2015–)

==Nobel prizes awarded to FIAN scientists==
* 1958 — Pavel Cherenkov, Igor Tamm, Ilya Frank: &quot;for the discovery and the interpretation of the Cherenkov-Vavilov effect&quot;.
* 1964 — Nikolay Basov, Alexander Prokhorov: &quot;for fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle&quot;.
* 1975 — Andrei Sakharov won a Peace Prize for his campaigning for human rights.
* 2003 — Vitaly Ginzburg: &quot;for pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids&quot;.

== Facilities ==

The institute has, among other research facilities, a particle accelerator: 1.2 GeV electron synchrotron called &quot;Pakhra&quot;, located in Troitsk near Moscow (at the LPI&#x27;s HEP department). However, the institute is not totally (or even perhaps mainly) focused on accelerator/particle physics, but the scope of the research of the institute contains most of the areas of modern physics.

==Publications of the Institute==
* &quot;Краткие сообщения по физике&quot; ; English version: &quot;Bulletin of the Lebedev Physics Institute&quot;
*&quot;Квантовая электроника&quot; ; English translation: &quot;Quantum Electronics&quot; (formerly &quot;Soviet Journal of Quantum Electronics&quot;)

==Films about the Lebedev Physical Institute==
In 2021 it was released a documentary “Mishik Kazaryan: The Path of an Explorer” (2021) ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWuZsXSCFxo ). The film (original title «Мишик Казарян: путь Искателя») was directed by Leonid Ioffe. It narrates about the life and work of Professor Mishik Kazaryan, an experimental physicist, laureate of the USSR State Prize, who worked in the Lebedev Physical Institute. The film also allows to immerse into the life of the Lebedev Physical Institute since middle of 1960-s.

<text>Richard John Adams (born 28 October 1946) is a British businessman and social entrepreneur. He is the founder of the UK fair trade organisations Tearcraft and Traidcraft and of a number of social enterprises which promote environmentally responsible and ethical business.

==Early life and education==
Adams attended King Edward VI Five Ways school in Birmingham. He has degrees in sociology (St John&#x27;s College, Durham University), theology (University of London) and business administration (Newcastle University). He received an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law in 2005 from Newcastle University and one from Durham University in 2007. He also holds a National Licensee&#x27;s Certificate for on-licensed premises.

==Career==
After visiting small farmers in Gujarat, India, in 1973 Adams established Agrofax Labour Intensive Products, an agricultural imports company in London with distribution to the main wholesale markets. In 1974 this business began importing crafts from farming communities in Bangladesh, following which he founded Tearcraft which became the marketing arm of the UK relief and development charity, Tearfund.

In 1979 Adams established the independent company Traidcraft, which became a plc in 1984, offering the first &#x27;alternative&#x27; and socially orientated public share issue in the UK. In 1989 Adams convened the steering committee of what became the UK&#x27;s Fairtrade Foundation, based on the Dutch Max Havelaar Foundation. He was its founding director, and a member of its board from 1992 to 1999.

In 1994 Adams founded the Creative Consumer Co-operative, through which Out of this World, Britain&#x27;s first chain of organic grocery stores with an explicit ethical, fair trade, social and environmental agenda, were launched. In 2000 he co-founded the Warm Zone programme to combat fuel poverty and in 2006 was appointed as a non-executive director of Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Primary Care Trust and in 2010 was appointed Chair of Newcastle and North Tyneside Community Health (NHS). 
Adams was a director of the UK Social Investment Forum 1992–1996; Chair of the Student Christian Movement 1994–1997 and, with Mark Hayes, a co-initiator and founding director of the social investment society, Shared Interest. He was appointed by the UK Government in 2001 as one of 24 UK members of the Brussels–based Economic and Social Committee of the European Union, serving for 14 years and then as a Delegate to the EESC&#x27;s Consultative Commission on Industrial Change until the UK&#x27;s exit from the EU. In this role he worked mainly on energy and climate related issues and has been involved in animal welfare, fisheries&#x27; sustainability, transport and agricultural issues. He was co-chair of the European Nuclear Energy Forum (ENEF) from 2011 to 2014, was until 2018 a member of the Corporate Responsibility Stakeholder Council of Innogy SE and was a Trustee of the energy policy think-tank, Sustainability First. He chairs the board of directors of the Fair Trade Advocacy Office in Brussels.

==Honours==
Adams is a visiting fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Durham and a visiting professor at Northumbria University. In the 2001 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &quot;for services to the promotion of ethical trading&quot;. He won the &quot;New Statesman&quot; Social Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2005 and in 2006 was listed by &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper as one of the top 50 people in the UK who had had most impact in &quot;making the world a better place&quot; for his development of the concept of ethical shopping.

<text>Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev (; 24 February 1866 – 1 March 1912) was a Russian physicist. His name was also transliterated as Peter Lebedew and Peter Lebedev. Lebedev was the creator of the first scientific school in Russia.

==Career==
Lebedev made his doctoral degree in Strasbourg under the supervision of August Kundt in 1887–1891. In 1891, he started working in Moscow State University in the group of Alexander Stoletov. There he made his famous experimental studies of electromagnetic waves.

Along with Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose he was one of the first to investigate millimeter waves, generating 50 GHz (6 mm) microwaves beginning in 1895 with a spark oscillator made of two platinum cylinders 1.5 cm long and 0.5 diameter immersed in kerosene at the focus of a parabolic reflector, and detecting the waves with an iron-constantan thermocouple detector.

With this apparatus, he extended the work of Heinrich Hertz to higher frequencies, duplicating classical optics experiments using quasioptical components such as lenses, prisms and quarter-wave plates made of sulfur and wire diffraction gratings to demonstrate refraction, diffraction, double refraction, birefringence and polarization of millimeter waves.

He was the first to measure the pressure of light on a solid body in 1899. The discovery was announced at the World Physics Congress in Paris in 1900, and became the first quantitative confirmation of Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism.

An English translation of the paper as well as a historical review is in.

In 1909, he reported that the pressure of light on gas is in agreement with predictions based on Maxwell&#x27;s theory.

== Later life ==
In 1901, he became a professor at Moscow State University, however, he quit the University in 1911, protesting against the politics of the Ministry of Education. In the same year, he received an invitation to become a professor in Stockholm, which he rejected. He died the next year of a hereditary heart condition.

== Legacy ==
The Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow and the lunar crater Lebedev are named after him.

<doc id="696394" wikidata="Q978130" url="?curid=696394" title="Gelsemium sempervirens">
<text>Gelsemium sempervirens is a twining vine in the family Gelsemiaceae, native to subtropical and tropical America: Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Mexico (Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo), and southeastern and south-central United States (from Texas to Virginia). It has a number of common names including yellow jessamine or confederate jessamine or jasmine, Carolina jasmine or jessamine, evening trumpetflower, gelsemium and woodbine.

Yellow jessamine is the state flower of South Carolina.

Despite its common name, the species is not a &quot;true jasmine&quot; and not of the genus &quot;Jasminum&quot;.

==Growth==
&quot;Gelsemium sempervirens&quot; can grow to high when given suitable climbing support in trees, with thin stems. The plant is perennial. The leaves are evergreen, lanceolate, long and broad, and lustrous, dark green. The flowers are borne in clusters, the individual flowers yellow, sometimes with an orange center, trumpet-shaped, long and broad. Its flowers are strongly scented and produce nectar that attracts a range of pollinators.

==History==
Some 19th century sources identified &quot;Gelsemium sempervirens&quot; as a folk remedy for various medical conditions. William Bartram encountered this species (then referred to as Bignonia sempervirens) on his travels along the coasts of the Carolinas and Georgia in 1773.

==Toxicity==
All parts of this plant contain the toxic strychnine-related alkaloids gelsemine and gelseminine and should not be consumed. The sap may cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals. Children, mistaking this flower for honeysuckle, have been poisoned by sucking the nectar from the flower. The nectar is also toxic to honeybees, which may cause brood death when gathered by the bees. The nectar may, however, be beneficial to bumblebees. It has been shown that bumblebees fed on gelsemine have a reduced load of &quot;Crithidia bombi&quot; in their fecal matter after 7 days, although this difference was not significant after 10 days. Reduced parasite load increases foraging efficiency, and pollinators may selectively collect otherwise toxic secondary metabolites as a means of self-medication.

The plant can be lethal to livestock.

==Cultivation==
Despite the hazards, this is a popular garden plant in warmer areas, frequently being trained to grow over arbors or to cover walls. In the UK, it has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. It can be grown outdoors in mild and coastal areas of the UK (to a lower limit of ), but elsewhere must be grown under glass. It requires a sheltered position in full sun or light shade.

The peninsula has a volcanic origin having the Snæfellsnes volcanic belt down its centre, and the Snæfellsjökull volcano, regarded as one of the symbols of Iceland, at its western tip. With its height of , it is the highest mountain on the peninsula and has a glacier at its peak (&quot;jökull&quot; means &quot;glacier&quot; in Icelandic). The volcano can be seen on clear days from Reykjavík, a distance of about . The mountain is also known as the setting of the novel &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; by the French author Jules Verne. The area surrounding Snæfellsjökull has been designated one of the four national parks by the government of Iceland. It is also the home of the Ingjaldsholl church, a Protestant church.

The peninsula is one of the main settings in the &quot;Laxdœla saga&quot; and it was, according to this saga, the birthplace of the first West Norse member of the Varangian Guard, Bolli Bollasson. Other historical people who lived in the area according to the saga include Guðrún Ósvífursdóttir, Bolli Þorleiksson and Snorri Goði.

Local fishing villages and small towns on the Snæfellsnes peninsula include Arnarstapi, Hellnar, Rif , Ólafsvík, Grundarfjörður and Stykkishólmur.

Near Hellissandur is the tallest structure in western Europe, the Longwave Radio Mast at Hellissandur. 

In June 2008, the people of Snæfellsnes reached certification status as an EarthCheck community, becoming the first EarthCheck-certified area in Iceland and in Europe, and only the fourth in the world. Snæfellsnes has been committed to the EarthCheck programme since 2003 and has been successfully benchmarked for the past five consecutive years.

== Ecology ==
On the peninsula 323 species of flowering plants and ferns have been identified and generally the plant ecology is typical of the Iceland boreal birch forests and alpine tundra ecosystem. &quot;Ligusticum scoticum&quot; (Scots lovage, Scottish licorice-root) is an edible plant only found in Iceland on the western aspects of the peninsula. Along the southern coast are many relatively undisturbed wetland habitats with diversity in the plants present. There are 13 species of wading birds found in Snæfellsnes and many other aquatic birds.

Breiðafjörður is an important marine ecosystem with its seaweed and kelp forests and the largest seal and maritime bird populations in Iceland. Seal hunting was banned in Iceland in 2019, after a major reduction in numbers after 1980. Killer whale pods are often found off the western part of the peninsula and many other whales can be seen, noting that some whaling has been allowed by Iceland since 2003. Over 60 species of birds nest in Snæfellsnes. Puffins tend to be found on the western peninsula and are not present in winter. White-tailed eagle populations in Iceland only started recovering in the 1970s after being a protected species from 1913 and other birds of prey are found. Short-eared owls, a protected bird in Iceland, are common in areas of the Snæfellsnes. 

Up to settlement only the arctic fox was present as top carnivore but now as elsewhere in Iceland there are many other introduced mammals that affect the ecosystem. The arctic fox is generally separated into highland and low land populations with the later having a reddish brown coat all year. Within the Snæfellsjökull National Park fox hunting has been banned since 2001. The American mink colonised the peninsula early after its escape into the wild in Iceland in 1932 and since then the Icelandic population peaked about 2003 without any evidence that human hunting is the reason for the recent decline in population. While there are four rodents in the wild in Iceland, only the wood mouse is found in large numbers on Snæfellsnes.

<doc id="696408" wikidata="Q934509" url="?curid=696408" title="Monomial order">
<text>In mathematics, a monomial order (sometimes called a term order or an admissible order) is a total order on the set of all (monic) monomials in a given polynomial ring, satisfying the property of respecting multiplication, i.e.,
* If formula_1 and formula_2 is any other monomial, then formula_3.

Monomial orderings are most commonly used with Gröbner bases and multivariate division. In particular, the property of &quot;being&quot; a Gröbner basis is always relative to a specific monomial order.

== Definition, details and variations ==
Besides respecting multiplication, monomial orders are often required to be well-orders, since this ensures the multivariate division procedure will terminate. There are however practical applications also for multiplication-respecting order relations on the set of monomials that are not well-orders.

In the case of finitely many variables, well-ordering of a monomial order is equivalent to the conjunction of the following two conditions:
# The order is a total order.
# If &quot;u&quot; is any monomial then formula_4.
Since these conditions may be easier to verify for a monomial order defined through an explicit rule, than to directly prove it is a well-ordering, they are sometimes preferred in definitions of monomial order. 
=== Leading monomials, terms, and coefficients ===

The choice of a total order on the monomials allows sorting the terms of a polynomial. The leading term of a polynomial is thus the term of the largest monomial (for the chosen monomial ordering). 

Concretely, let be any ring of polynomials. Then the set of the (monic) monomials in is a basis of , considered as a vector space over the field of the coefficients. Thus, any nonzero polynomial in has a unique expression 
formula_5 
as a linear combination of monomials, where is a finite subset of and the are all nonzero. When a monomial order has been chosen, the leading monomial is the largest in , the leading coefficient is the corresponding , and the leading term is the corresponding . &quot;Head&quot; monomial/coefficient/term is sometimes used as a synonym of &quot;leading&quot;. Some authors use &quot;monomial&quot; instead of &quot;term&quot; and &quot;power product&quot; instead of &quot;monomial&quot;. In this article, a monomial is assumed to not include a coefficient.

The defining property of monomial orderings implies that the order of the terms is kept when multiplying a polynomial by a monomial. Also, the leading term of a product of polynomials is the product of the leading terms of the factors.

== Examples ==
On the set formula_6 of powers of any one variable &quot;x&quot;, the only monomial orders are the natural ordering 1 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; x2 &lt; x3 &lt; ... and its converse, the latter of which is not a well-ordering. Therefore, the notion of monomial order becomes interesting only in the case of multiple variables.

The monomial order implies an order on the individual indeterminates. One can simplify the classification of monomial orders by assuming that the indeterminates are named &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3, ... in decreasing order for the monomial order considered, so that always . (If there should be infinitely many indeterminates, this convention is incompatible with the condition of being a well ordering, and one would be forced to use the opposite ordering; however the case of polynomials in infinitely many variables is rarely considered.) In the example below we use &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; instead of &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2 and &quot;x&quot;3. With this convention there are still many examples of different monomial orders.

=== Lexicographic order ===
Lexicographic order (lex) first compares exponents of &quot;x&quot;1 in the monomials, and in case of equality compares exponents of &quot;x&quot;2, and so forth. The name is derived from the similarity with the usual alphabetical order used in lexicography for dictionaries, if monomials are represented by the sequence of the exponents of the indeterminates. If the number of indeterminates is fixed (as it is usually the case), the lexicographical order is a well-order, although this is not the case for the lexicographical order applied to sequences of various lengths.

For monomials of degree at most two in two indeterminates formula_7, the lexicographic order (with formula_8) is

formula_9

For Gröbner basis computations, the lexicographic ordering tends to be the most costly; thus it should be avoided, as far as possible, except for very simple computations.

=== Graded lexicographic order ===
Graded lexicographic order (grlex, or deglex for degree lexicographic order) first compares the total degree (sum of all exponents), and in case of a tie applies lexicographic order. This ordering is not only a well ordering, it also has the property that any monomial is preceded only by a finite number of other monomials; this is not the case for lexicographic order, where all (infinitely many) powers of &quot;y&quot; are less than &quot;x&quot; (that lexicographic order is nevertheless a well ordering is related to the impossibility of constructing an infinite decreasing chain of monomials). 

For monomials of degree at most two in two indeterminates formula_7, the graded lexicographic order (with formula_8) is

formula_12

Although very natural, this ordering is rarely used: the Gröbner basis for the graded reverse lexicographic order, which follows, is easier to compute and provides the same information on the input set of polynomials.

=== Graded reverse lexicographic order ===
Graded reverse lexicographic order (grevlex, or degrevlex for degree reverse lexicographic order) compares the total degree first, then uses a lexicographic order as tie-breaker, but it &quot;reverses the outcome&quot; of the lexicographic comparison so that lexicographically larger monomials of the same degree are considered to be degrevlex smaller. For the final order to exhibit the conventional ordering of the indeterminates, it is furthermore necessary that the tie-breaker lexicographic order before reversal considers the &quot;last&quot; indeterminate &quot;x&quot;n to be the largest, which means it must start with that indeterminate. A concrete recipe for the graded reverse lexicographic order is thus to compare by the total degree first, then compare exponents of the &quot;last&quot; indeterminate &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; but &quot;reversing the outcome&quot; (so the monomial with smaller exponent is larger in the ordering), followed (as always only in case of a tie) by a similar comparison of &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, and so forth ending with &quot;x&quot;1. 

The differences between graded lexicographic and graded reverse lexicographic orders are subtle, since they in fact coincide for 1 and 2 indeterminates. The first difference comes for degree 2 monomials in 3 indeterminates, which are graded lexicographic ordered as formula_13 but graded reverse lexicographic ordered as formula_14. The general trend is that the reverse order exhibits all variables among the small monomials of any given degree, whereas with the non-reverse order the intervals of smallest monomials of any given degree will only be formed from the smallest variables.

=== Elimination order ===
Block order or elimination order (lexdeg) may be defined for any number of blocks but, for sake of simplicity, we consider only the case of two blocks (however, if the number of blocks equals the number of variables, this order is simply the lexicographic order). For this ordering, the variables are divided in two blocks &quot;x&quot;1..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;h&quot; and &quot;y&quot;1...,&quot;y&quot;&quot;k&quot; and a monomial ordering is chosen for each block, usually the graded reverse lexicographical order. Two monomials are compared by comparing their &quot;x&quot; part, and in case of a tie, by comparing their &quot;y&quot; part. This ordering is important as it allows &quot;elimination&quot;, an operation which corresponds to projection in algebraic geometry.

=== Weight order ===
Weight order depends on a vector formula_15 called the weight vector. It first compares the dot product of the exponent sequences of the monomials with this weight vector, and in case of a tie uses some other fixed monomial order. For instance, the graded orders above are weight orders for the &quot;total degree&quot; weight vector (1,1...,1). If the &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot; are rationally independent numbers (so in particular none of them are zero and all fractions formula_16 are irrational) then a tie can never occur, and the weight vector itself specifies a monomial ordering. In the contrary case, one could use another weight vector to break ties, and so on; after using &quot;n&quot; linearly independent weight vectors, there cannot be any remaining ties. One can in fact define &quot;any&quot; monomial ordering by a sequence of weight vectors (Cox et al. pp. 72–73), for instance (1,0,0...,0), (0,1,0...,0), ... (0,0...,1) for lex, or (1,1,1...,1), (1,1..., 1,0), ... (1,0...,0) for grevlex.

For example, consider the monomials formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, and formula_20; the monomial orders above would order these four monomials as follows:

* Lex: formula_21 (power of formula_22 dominates).
* Grlex: formula_23 (total degree dominates; higher power of formula_22 broke tie among the first two).
* Grevlex: formula_25 (total degree dominates; lower power of formula_26 broke tie among the first two).
* A weight order with weight vector (1,2,4): formula_27 (the dot products 10&gt;9&gt;8&gt;3 do not leave any ties to be broken here).

== Related notions ==

* An elimination order guarantees that a monomial involving any of a set of indeterminates will always be greater than a monomial not involving any of them.
* A product order is the easier example of an elimination order. It consists in combining monomial orders on disjoint sets of indeterminates into a monomial order on their union. It simply compares the exponents of the indeterminates in the first set using the first monomial order, then breaks ties using the other monomial ordering on the indeterminates of the second set. This method obviously generalizes to any disjoint union of sets of indeterminates; the lexicographic order can be so obtained from the singleton sets {&quot;x&quot;1}, {&quot;x&quot;2}, {&quot;x&quot;3}, ... (with the unique monomial ordering for each singleton).

When using monomial orderings to compute Gröbner bases, different orders can lead to different results, and the difficulty of the computation may vary dramatically. For example, graded reverse lexicographic order has a reputation for producing, almost always, the Gröbner bases that are the easiest to compute (this is enforced by the fact that, under rather common conditions on the ideal, the polynomials in the Gröbner basis have a degree that is at most exponential in the number of variables; no such complexity result exists for any other ordering). On the other hand, elimination orders are required for elimination and relative problems.

<doc id="696413" wikidata="Q3087695" url="?curid=696413" title="Ronald Hutton">
<text>Ronald Edmund Hutton (born 19 December 1953) is an Indian-born English historian specialising in early modern Britain, British folklore, pre-Christian religion, and modern paganism. A professor at the University of Bristol, Hutton has written over a dozen books, often appearing on British television and radio. He held a fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, and is a Commissioner of English Heritage.

Born in Ootacamund, India, his family returned to England, and he attended a school in Ilford and became particularly interested in archaeology. He volunteered in a number of excavations until 1976 and visited the country&#x27;s chambered tombs. He studied history at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and then Magdalen College, Oxford, before he lectured in history at the University of Bristol from 1981. Specialising in Early Modern Britain, he wrote three books on the subject: &quot;The Royalist War Effort&quot; (1981), &quot;The Restoration&quot; (1985), and &quot;Charles the Second&quot; (1990).

He followed these with books about historical paganism, folklore, and modern paganism in Britain: &quot;The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles&quot; (1991), &quot;The Rise and Fall of Merry England&quot; (1994), &quot;The Stations of the Sun&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Triumph of the Moon&quot; (1999), the last of which would come to be praised as a seminal text in Pagan studies. Subsequent work include &quot;Shamans&quot; (2001), covering Siberian shamanism in the western imagination; &quot;Witches, Druids and King Arthur&quot; (2003), a collection of essays on folklore and Paganism; then two books on the role of the Druids in the British imagination: &quot;The Druids&quot; (2007) and &quot;Blood and Mistletoe&quot; (2009).

Elected a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales in 2011, then a Fellow of the British Academy in 2013, Hutton was appointed Gresham Professor of Divinity in 2022.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1953–1980===
Hutton was born on 19 December 1953 in Ootacamund, India, to a colonial family, and is of part-Russian ancestry. Upon arriving in England, he attended Ilford County High School, whilst becoming greatly interested in archaeology, joining the committee of a local archaeological group and taking part in excavations from 1965 to 1976, including at such sites as Pilsdon Pen hill fort, Ascott-under-Wychwood long barrow, Hen Domen castle and a temple on Malta. Meanwhile, during the period between 1966 and 1969, he visited &quot;every prehistoric chambered tomb surviving in England and Wales, and wrote a guide to them, for myself [Hutton] and friends.&quot;

Despite his love of archaeology, he instead decided to study history at university, believing that he had &quot;probably more aptitude&quot; for it. He won a scholarship to study at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he continued his interest in archaeology alongside history, in 1975 taking a course run by the university&#x27;s archaeologist Glyn Daniel, an expert on the Neolithic. From Cambridge, he went on to study at Oxford University, where he gained a doctorate, supervised by Hugh Trevor-Roper, and took up a fellowship at Magdalen College.

===Bristol University and first publications: 1981–1990===
In 1981, Hutton moved to the University of Bristol where he took up the position of reader of History. In that year he also published his first book, &quot;The Royalist War Effort 1642–1646&quot;, and followed it with three more books on 17th century British history by 1990.

===&quot;The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles&quot;: 1991–1993===

Hutton followed his studies on the Early Modern period with a book on a very different subject, &quot;The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy&quot; (1991), in which he attempted to &quot;set out what is at present known about the religious beliefs and practices of the British Isles before their conversion to Christianity. The term &#x27;pagan&#x27; is used as a convenient shorthand for those beliefs and practices, and is employed in the title merely to absolve the book from any need to discuss early Christianity itself.&quot; It thereby examined religion during the Palaeolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Roman occupation and Anglo-Saxon period, as well as a brief examination of their influence on folklore and contemporary Paganism. In keeping with what was by then the prevailing academic view, it disputed the widely held idea that ancient paganism had survived into the contemporary and had been revived by the Pagan movement.

The book proved controversial amongst some contemporary Pagans and feminists involved in the Goddess movement, one of whom, Asphodel Long, issued a public criticism of Hutton in which she charged him with failing to take non-mainstream ideas about ancient goddess cults into consideration. Ultimately, Hutton would later relate, she &quot;recognised that she had misunderstood me&quot; and the two became friends. Another feminist critic, Max Dashu, condemned the work as containing &quot;factual errors, mischaracterizations, and outright whoppers&quot; and said she was &quot;staggered by the intense anti-feminism of this book&quot;. She went on to attack Hutton&#x27;s writing style, calling the book &quot;dry as dust&quot; and said she was &quot;sorry I bothered to plough through it. If this is rigor, it is mortis.&quot;

Meanwhile, whilst he faced criticism from some sectors of the Pagan community in Britain, others came to embrace him; during the late 1980s and 1990s, Hutton befriended a number of practising British Pagans, including &quot;leading Druids&quot; such as Tim Sebastion, who was then Chief of the Secular Order of Druids. On the basis of &quot;The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles&quot; (which he himself had not actually read), Sebastion invited Hutton to speak at a conference in Avebury where he befriended a number of members of the Pagan Druidic movement, including Philip Carr-Gomm, Emma Restall Orr and John Michell.

===Studies of British folklore: 1994–1996===
In the following years, Hutton released two books on British folklore, both of which were published by Oxford University Press: &quot;The Rise and Fall of Merry England: The Ritual Year 1400–1700&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain&quot; (1996). In these works he criticised commonly held attitudes, such as the idea of Merry England and the idea that folk customs were static and unchanging over the centuries. Once again, he was following prevailing expert opinion in doing so.

===&quot;The Triumph of the Moon&quot;: 1997–1999===

In 1999, his first work fully focusing on Paganism was published by Oxford University Press; &quot;The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft&quot;. The book dealt with the history of the Pagan religion of Wicca, and in the preface Hutton stated that:

:the subtitle of this book should really be &#x27;a history of modern pagan witchcraft in South Britain (England, Wales, Cornwall and Man), with some reference to it in the rest of the British Isles, Continental Europe and North America&#x27;. The fact that it claims to be &quot;a&quot; history and not &quot;the&quot; history is in itself significant, for this book represents the first systematic attempt by a professional historian to characterise and account for this aspect of modern Western culture.&quot;

Hutton questioned many assumptions about Wicca&#x27;s development, argued that many of the claimed connections to longstanding hidden pagan traditions are questionable at best and also for its importance as a genuine new religious movement.

====Response from the Neopagan community====

The response from the Neopagan community was somewhat mixed. Many Pagans embraced his work, with the prominent Wiccan Elder Frederic Lamond referring to it as &quot;an authority on the history of Gardnerian Wicca&quot;. Public criticism came from the practising Wiccan Jani Farrell-Roberts, who took part in a published debate with Hutton in &quot;The Cauldron&quot; magazine in 2003. Farrell-Roberts was of the opinion that in his works, Hutton dismissed Margaret Murray&#x27;s theories about the Witch-Cult using Norman Cohn&#x27;s theories, which she believed to be heavily flawed. She stated that &quot;he is... wrongly cited as an objective neutral and a &#x27;non-pagan&#x27; for he happens to be a very active member of the British Pagan community&quot; who &quot;had taken on a mission to reform modern paganism by removing from it a false history and sense of continuance&quot;.

===&quot;Shamans&quot; and &quot;Witches, Druids and King Arthur&quot;: 2000–2006===

Hutton next turned his attention to Siberian shamanism, with Hambledon and London publishing &quot;Shamans: Siberian Spirituality in the Western Imagination&quot; in 2001, in which he argued that much of what westerners think they know about shamanism is in fact wrong.

In his review for the academic &quot;Folklore&quot; journal, Jonathan Roper of the University of Sheffield noted that the work &quot;could profitably have been twice as long and have provided a more extended treatment of the issues involved&quot; and that it suffered from a lack of images. On the whole he thought it should be &quot;recommended to readers as an important work&quot; on the subject of shamanism, and hoped that Hutton would &quot;return to treat this fascinating topic in even greater depth in future&quot;.

In 2003, Hambledon &amp; London also published &quot;Witches, Druids and King Arthur&quot;, a collection of various articles by Hutton, including on topics such as the nature of myth and the pagan themes found within the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.

===&quot;The Druids&quot; and &quot;Blood and Mistletoe&quot;: 2007–2009===
After studying the history of Wicca, Hutton went on to look at the history of Druidry, both the historical and the contemporary. His first book on the subject, &quot;The Druids&quot;, was published in 2007. Part of this material was given as the first lecture of the Mount Haemus Award series. Hutton&#x27;s next book, which was also about Druidry, was entitled &quot;Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain&quot;, and released in May 2009.

In a review by David V. Barrett in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;Blood and Mistletoe&quot; was described as being more &quot;academic and more than three times the length&quot; of &quot;The Druids&quot;, although Barrett argued that despite this it was still &quot;very readable&quot;, even going so far as to call it a &quot;tour de force&quot;. The review by Noel Malcolm in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was a little more critical, claiming that whilst Hutton was &quot;non-sensationalist and scrupulously polite&quot; about the various Druidic eccentrics, &quot;occasionally, even-handedness tips over towards relativism – as if there are just different ways of looking at reality, each as good as the other. And that cannot be right.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hutton was married to Lisa Radulovic from August 1988 to March 2003, when they divorced.
Although he has written much on the subject of Paganism, Hutton insists that his own religious beliefs are a private matter. He has instead stated that &quot;to some extent history occupies the space in my life filled in that of others by religion or spirituality. It defines much of the way I come to terms with the cosmos, and with past, present and future.&quot; He was raised Pagan, and was personally acquainted with Wiccans from youth. He has become a &quot;well-known and much loved figure&quot; in the British Pagan community.

Interviewing Hutton for &quot;The Independent&quot;, the journalist Gary Lachman commented that he had &quot;a very pragmatic, creative attitude, recognising that factual error can still produce beneficial results&quot;, for instance noting that even though their theories about the Early Modern witch-cult were erroneous, Margaret Murray and Gerald Gardner would help lay the foundations for the creation of the new religious movement of Wicca.

Hutton was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to history.

==Works==
Hutton&#x27;s books can be divided into those about seventeenth-century Britain and those about paganism and folk customs in Britain.

===Seventeenth century Britain===
In his &quot;What If the Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded?&quot;, Hutton has considered what might have happened if the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 had succeeded in its aims of the death of King James I and the destruction of the House of Lords. He concluded that the violence of the act would have resulted in an even more severe backlash against suspected Catholics than was caused by its failure, as most Englishmen were loyal to the monarchy, despite differing religious convictions. England could very well have become a more &quot;Puritan absolute monarchy&quot;, rather than following the path of parliamentary and civil reform.

<doc id="696417" wikidata="Q848457" url="?curid=696417" title="Speedcore">
<text>Speedcore is a form of electronic music that is characterized by a high tempo and aggressive themes. It was created in the early to mid-1990s and the name originates from the hardcore genre as well as the high tempo used. Songs are usually classified as speedcore at around 300+ beats per minute (BPM), but this can vary.

==Characteristics==
Aside from the very fast tempo, speedcore can often be distinguished from other forms of hardcore by an aggressive and overridden electronic percussion track that is often punctuated with a hyperactive snare or tom-tom fills. Most producers will overdrive their kicks so far that they become square waves. Speedcore DJs often use violent, vulgar, and offensive themes in their music to push the boundaries of the genre.

Since the 2000s, the use of digital audio workstations (DAWs) has grown versus the use of analog synthesizers or trackers.

== History ==
=== Origins (1992–1993) ===
Speedcore is a natural progression of hardcore techno. Hardcore was already considered fast, however, there were those who were not content to stay at the established speed. Early speedcore was about pushing the limits of BPM and aggression level. One of the first songs to explore higher speeds was &quot;Thousand&quot; by Moby in 1992, which peaked at approximately 1,015 BPM. 

=== Early speedcore (1994–1999) ===

The term speedcore in reference to high tempo hardcore/gabber can be traced as far back as 1995. Disciples Of Annihilation coined the name of the genre with their track &quot;NYC Speedcore&quot;. Belgian artist DJ Einrich refined the sound in the late 1990s, using oscillators to transform fast kick drums into notes in octaves.

It was not until the early 2000s that the genre was commonly referred to as speedcore. Before then, many tracks that would be considered speedcore were referred to as &quot;gabba&quot;.

=== Spread (early 2000s) ===
The early 2000s saw the birth of many netlabels dedicated to speedcore. Many labels who produced vinyl were also publishing MP3 files on their websites, which became increasingly popular and made it easier for new producers to enter the scene. 

=== Internet growth (2010s) ===
The 2010s saw a large growth in netlabels. DAWs made it cheaper and easier for new musicians to make experimental music. The internet allowed producers from around the world to communicate with each other and share their works through netlabels. Compilation albums became very popular for artists to share their music as they could get more exposure than by themselves. A large portion of the speedcore scene now occurs online from netlabels to speedcore promotion channels on YouTube. Speedcore was no longer restrained to localized areas where raves occurred and records were released.

==Subgenres==
===Splittercore===
Speedcore is often called splittercore when the BPM count is between 600 and 1,000. Splittercore is identified by its minigun sounding kicks. In the 1990s splittercore was sometimes referred to as nosebleed techno.

=== Flashcore ===
Flashcore is a genre that grew out of speedcore and industrial hardcore. While being originally related to speedcore, flashcore is defined by its complex avant-garde structures and abstract sounds, making it more similar to electroacoustic music and experimental music rather than any EDM genre. Most of the genre&#x27;s works focus on intense, rhythmic, and layered soundscapes.

=== Extratone ===
Songs with a BPM of 1,000 or higher are known as extratone songs. At this tempo, the kicks happen so fast that the beat sounds like one constant note with a shifting pitch; extratone often has sudden increases or decreases in tempo to change the pitch of the tone. The name &quot;Extratone&quot; originates from combining the two German words &quot;extrahieren&quot; (to extract) and &quot;ton&quot; (sound).

<text>Muirfield Village is an “upscale” golf-oriented community in the central United States, located in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb north of Columbus.

==Origins==
Founded by Jack Nicklaus, it is named after Muirfield, Scotland, where he won the first of his three British Open titles in 1966 to complete the first of his three career grand slams. The village contains an eponymous golf course that hosts the Memorial Tournament, a PGA Tour event played each spring since its inception in 1976. A bronze sculpture of Nicklaus mentoring a young golfer, unveiled in 1999, is located in the wide median of Muirfield Drive.

Although the land for the Muirfield Village Golf Club was acquired in 1966, construction began six years later and the golf club officially opened in May 1974, the same year that homes began to be sold. Muirfield Village is one of the wealthiest and most notable neighborhoods in Central Ohio, and is home to many local CEOs and celebrities including Jack Hanna, Urban Meyer, Jason Day and several Columbus Blue Jackets players. The community master plan and site development was designed by Bassett Associates of Lima, Ohio.

Muirfield Village functions as its own taxing unit with power to raise money for street lights, landscaping, and other municipal-like functions, despite being within the city of Dublin. It has its own neighborhood council for residents to participate in.

==Golf courses==

Two golf courses are located within Muirfield Village: The Country Club at Muirfield, which also has tennis and swimming, and the signature Muirfield Village Golf Club, where the Memorial Tournament is held annually. MVGC has also hosted several national championships and international team competitions, including the 1992 U.S. Amateur, 1987 Ryder Cup, the 1998 Solheim Cup, the 1986 U.S. Junior Amateur and the 2013 Presidents Cup. It and The Greenbrier in West Virginia are the only two US courses to have hosted both the Ryder and Solheim Cups. When asked whether he would be interested in captaining the U.S. squad in the matches on his home course, Jack Nicklaus responded that although he would enjoy it, he believes captains should be more &quot;current&quot; with the players on the team.

Muirfield Village is controlled by Nicklaus, and he has regularly made changes to the course in order to accommodate new technology, make the course more enjoyable for members and tournament spectators, or simply offer a tougher test for the pros. In the 2010&#x27;s, changes included lengthening several holes, including the first, tenth, twelfth, and seventeenth, adding bunkers, particularly at the tenth and seventeenth, and rerouting a stream on the eighteenth hole. In 2013, the eighteenth hole was lengthened by 40 yards. He also made changes to the driving range, added several suites overlooking the 18th hole, and completely remodeled the clubhouse inside and out. In 2014, &quot;Golf Digest&quot; rated Muirfield Village as the number one golf course in Ohio, and 53rd in the first-ever world&#x27;s 100 greatest golf courses. &quot;Golf Digest&quot; also ranked Muirfield Village 14th in the United States in 2018.

MVGC closed and underwent a large renovation after the 2020 Memorial Tournament. Every green complex was redone, bunkers were enlarged and deepened, and some positions of greens were moved. The biggest changes were made on the fifth and fifteenth holes, and there were no changes made to the twelfth and fourteenth holes. Nicklaus called this renovation &quot;his final bite at the apple&quot;, implying this would be the final major renovation in his lifetime.

Membership in MVGC is concentrated in Columbus and Ohio generally, however there is a substantial national and international membership as well. The club has sleeping quarters on the property for member use.

<text>Larry Ritchie (born March 5, 1932) was an American jazz drummer and record/CD producer. He was born in Brooklyn, New York as Lawrence Ritchie to Walter Ritchie, an electrician, and Pearl Ritchie, a domestic worker, both of whom were migrants from rural Virginia.

Ritchie has recorded with John Coltrane, Ray Draper, and Jackie McLean. Examples of his jazz work are provided by McLean&#x27;s &quot;Strange Blues&quot; (1957) and Freddie Redd&#x27;s &quot;Music from The Connection&quot; (1960).

Ritchie was also a talented painter and by the mid-1960s, he devoted more of his time to painting than to music.

<doc id="696438" wikidata="Q2915054" url="?curid=696438" title="Sybil (Schreiber book)">
<text>Sybil is a 1973 book by Flora Rheta Schreiber about the treatment of Sybil Dorsett (a pseudonym for Shirley Ardell Mason) for dissociative identity disorder (then referred to as &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot;) by her psychoanalyst, Cornelia B. Wilbur.

The book was made into two television movies of the same name, once in 1976 and again in 2007. There have also been books published after the fact, challenging the facts of Sybil&#x27;s therapy sessions. A few examples of these are &quot;SYBIL in her own words, Sybil Exposed&quot;, and &quot;After Sybil&quot;.

==Summary==
Mason is given the pseudonym &quot;Sybil&quot; by her therapist to protect her privacy. In 1998, Sigmund Freud historian Peter J. Swales discovered Sybil&#x27;s true identity. Originally in treatment for social anxiety and memory loss, after extended therapy involving amobarbital and hypnosis interviews, Sybil manifests sixteen personalities. Wilbur encouraged Sybil&#x27;s various selves to communicate and reveal information about her life. Wilbur writes that Sybil&#x27;s multiple personality disorder was a result of the severe physical and sexual abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her mother, Hattie.

===Described personalities===
The book begins with a list of Sybil&#x27;s &quot;alters&quot;, together with the year in which each appeared to have dissociated from the central personality. The names of these selves were also changed to ensure privacy.

*Sybil Isabel Dorsett (1923), the main personality
*Victoria Antoinette Scharleau (1926), nicknamed Vicky, self-assured and sophisticated young French girl
*Peggy Lou Baldwin (1926), assertive, enthusiastic, and often angry
*Peggy Ann Baldwin (1926), a counterpart of Peggy Lou but more fearful than angry
*Mary Lucinda Saunders Dorsett (1933), a thoughtful, contemplative, and maternal homebody
*Marcia Lynn Dorsett (1927), an extremely emotional writer and painter
*Vanessa Gail Dorsett (1935), intensely dramatic, fun-loving, and a talented musician. 
*Mike Dorsett (1928), one of Sybil&#x27;s two male selves, a builder and a carpenter
*Sid Dorsett (1928), the second of Sybil&#x27;s two male selves, a carpenter and a general handyman. Sid took his name from Sybil&#x27;s initials (Sybil Isabelle Dorsett).
*Nancy Lou Ann Baldwin (date undetermined), interested in politics as the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy and intensely afraid of Roman Catholics
*Sybil Ann Dorsett (1928), listless to the point of neurasthenia
*Ruthie Dorsett (date undetermined), a baby and one of the less developed selves
*Clara Dorsett (date undetermined), intensely religious and highly critical of Sybil
*Helen Dorsett (1929), intensely afraid but determined to achieve fulfillment
*Marjorie Dorsett (1928), serene, vivacious, and quick to laugh
*The Blonde (1946), a nameless perpetual teenager with an optimistic outlook

The book&#x27;s narrative describes Sybil&#x27;s selves gradually becoming co-conscious, able to communicate and share responsibilities, and having musical compositions and art published under their various names. Wilbur attempts to integrate Sybil&#x27;s various selves, first convincing them via hypnosis that they are all the same age, then encouraging them to merge. At the book&#x27;s end, a new, optimistic self (called &quot;The Blonde&quot;) emerges, preceding Sybil&#x27;s final integration into a single, whole individual with full knowledge of her past and present life.

==Controversy==
The book had an initial print run of 400,000. The book is believed by Mark Pendergrast and Joan Acocella to have established the template for the later upsurge in the diagnoses of dissociative identity disorders.

Audiotapes of recorded conversations between Schreiber and Wilbur were examined by Herbert Spiegel and later by academic Robert W. Rieber of John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Both concluded that Wilbur suggested multiple personalities to her client, whom they saw as a simple &quot;hysteric&quot;. Their purported proof of this claim is a session tape in which Wilbur is heard describing to Mason the personalities she has already seen Mason exhibit. Spiegel and Rieber also claim that Wilbur and Schreiber fabricated most of the book. Many details of the real case were changed or removed to protect Mason&#x27;s privacy.

Critics of Spiegel and Rieber&#x27;s &quot;revelation&quot; ask why they waited until after Schreiber, Wilbur, and Mason were all dead before revealing the tapes, which Spiegel supposedly had in his possession all along. A review of Rieber&#x27;s book &quot;Bifurcation of the Self&quot; by Mark Lawrence states that Rieber repeatedly distorted the evidence and left out a number of important facts about Mason&#x27;s case, in order to advance his case against the validity of the diagnosis.

Patrick Suraci, author of &quot;SYBIL in her own words&quot;, personally acquainted with Shirley Mason and still in touch with members of her family, criticizes Spiegel for what he terms unethical behavior in withholding the tapes. Spiegel also claimed to have made films of himself hypnotizing Mason, supposedly proving that Wilbur had &quot;implanted false memories&quot; in her mind, but when Suraci asked to see the films, Spiegel said he had lost them.

Wilbur&#x27;s psychiatric files were destroyed upon her death.

In 2011, journalist Debbie Nathan published a detailed exposé, &quot;Sybil Exposed&quot;, in which she claims that Wilbur, Mason and Schreiber knowingly perpetrated a fraud in order to create a &quot;Sybil, Inc.&quot; business, selling T-shirts, stickers, board games and other paraphernalia. Much of Nathan&#x27;s book repeats material already covered in the original &quot;Sybil&quot;, including a 1958 letter in which Mason spoke about making up the &quot;alters&quot; for attention and excitement. In &quot;Sybil&quot;, this letter was interpreted as an attempt to put difficult, painful therapy on hold. Nathan claims Schreiber became aware of Mason and her alleged past, writing &quot;Sybil&quot; based on stories coaxed from her during therapy, and that this case created an &quot;industry&quot; of repressed memory.

In 2013, artist-journalist Nancy Preston published &quot;After Sybil&quot;, a personal memoir which includes facsimile reproductions of Mason&#x27;s personal letters to her, along with color plates of her paintings. According to Preston, Mason taught art at Ohio&#x27;s Rio Grande College, where Preston was a student. The two became close friends and corresponded until a few days before Mason&#x27;s death. In the letters, Mason confirmed that she had had multiple personalities.

==Film adaptations==
There have been two film adaptations, both made for television:
* &quot;Sybil&quot; (1976 film), an NBC TV-movie starring Sally Field.
* &quot;Sybil&quot; (2007 film), a CBS TV-movie starring Tammy Blanchard.

==In computer security==
In computer security, a Sybil attack is one wherein a reputation system is subverted by creating multiple identities.

<text>A granular material is a conglomeration of discrete solid, macroscopic particles characterized by a loss of energy whenever the particles interact (the most common example would be friction when grains collide). The constituents that compose granular material are large enough such that they are not subject to thermal motion fluctuations. Thus, the lower size limit for grains in granular material is about 1 μm. On the upper size limit, the physics of granular materials may be applied to ice floes where the individual grains are icebergs and to asteroid belts of the Solar System with individual grains being asteroids.

Some examples of granular materials are snow, nuts, coal, sand, rice, coffee, corn flakes, salt, and bearing balls. Research into granular materials is thus directly applicable and goes back at least to Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, whose law of friction was originally stated for granular materials. Granular materials are commercially important in applications as diverse as pharmaceutical industry, agriculture, and energy production.

Powders are a special class of granular material due to their small particle size, which makes them more cohesive and more easily suspended in a gas.

The soldier/physicist Brigadier Ralph Alger Bagnold was an early pioneer of the physics of granular matter and whose book &quot;The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes&quot; remains an important reference to this day. According to material scientist Patrick Richard, &quot;Granular materials are ubiquitous in nature and are the second-most manipulated material in industry (the first one is water)&quot;.

In some sense, granular materials do not constitute a single phase of matter but have characteristics reminiscent of solids, liquids, or gases depending on the average energy per grain. However, in each of these states, granular materials also exhibit properties that are unique.

Granular materials also exhibit a wide range of pattern forming behaviors when excited (e.g. vibrated or allowed to flow). As such granular materials under excitation can be thought of as an example of a complex system. They also display fluid-based instabilities and phenomena such as Magnus effect.

== Definitions ==
Granular matter is a system composed of many macroscopic particles. Microscopic particles (atoms\molecules) are described (in classical mechanics) by all DOF of the system. Macroscopic particles are described only by DOF of the motion of each particle as a rigid body. In each particle are a lot of internal DOF. Consider inelastic collision between two particles - the energy from velocity as rigid body is transferred to microscopic internal DOF. We get “Dissipation” - irreversible heat generation. The result is that without external driving, eventually all particles will stop moving. In macroscopic particles thermal fluctuations are irrelevant.

When a matter is dilute and dynamic (driven) then it is called granular gas and dissipation phenomenon dominates.

When a matter is dense and static, then it is called granular solid and jamming phenomenon dominates.

When the density is intermediate, then it is called granular liquid.

== Static behaviors ==

=== Coulomb friction Law ===
Coulomb regarded internal forces between granular particles as a friction process, and proposed the friction law, that the force of friction of solid particles is proportional to the normal pressure between them and the static friction coefficient is greater than the kinetic friction coefficient. He studied the collapse of piles of sand and found empirically two critical angles: the maximal stable angle formula_1 and the minimum angle of repose formula_2. When the sandpile slope reaches the maximum stable angle, the sand particles on the surface of the pile begin to fall. The process stops when the surface inclination angle is equal to the angle of repose. The difference between these two angles, formula_3, is the Bagnold angle, which is a measure of the hysteresis of granular materials. This phenomenon is due to the force chains: stress in a granular solid is not distributed uniformly but is conducted away along so-called force chains which are networks of grains resting on one another. Between these chains are regions of low stress whose grains are shielded for the effects of the grains above by vaulting and arching. When the shear stress reaches a certain value, the force chains can break and the particles at the end of the chains on the surface begin to slide. Then, new force chains form until the shear stress is less than the critical value, and so the sandpile maintains a constant angle of repose.

=== Janssen Effect ===
In 1895, H. A. Janssen discovered that in a vertical cylinder filled with particles, the pressure measured at the base of the cylinder does not depend on the height of the filling, unlike Newtonian fluids at rest which follow Stevin&#x27;s law. Janssen suggested a simplified model with the following assumptions:

1) The vertical pressure, formula_4, is constant in the horizontal plane;

2) The horizontal pressure, formula_5, is proportional to the vertical pressure formula_4, where formula_7 is constant in space;

3) The wall friction static coefficient formula_8 sustains the vertical load at the contact with the wall;

4) The density of the material is constant over all depths.

The pressure in the granular material is then described in a different law, which accounts for saturation:

formula_9,

where formula_10 and formula_11 is the radius of the cylinder, and at the top of the silo formula_12.

The given pressure equation does not account for boundary conditions, such as the ratio between the particle size to the radius of the silo. Since the internal stress of the material cannot be measured, Janssen&#x27;s speculations have not been verified by any direct experiment.

=== Rowe Stress - Dilatancy Relation ===
In the early 1960s, Rowe studied dilatancy effect on shear strength in shear tests and proposed a relation between them.

The mechanical properties of assembly of mono-dispersed particles in 2D can be analyzed based on the representative elementary volume, with typical lengths, formula_13, in vertical and horizontal directions respectively. The geometric characteristics of the system is described by formula_14 and the variable formula_15, which describes the angle when the contact points begin the process of sliding. Denote by formula_16 the vertical direction, which is the direction of the major principal stress, and by formula_17 the horizontal direction, which is the direction of the minor principal stress.

Then stress on the boundary can be expressed as the concentrated force borne by individual particles. Under biaxial loading with uniform stress formula_18 and therefore formula_19.

At equilibrium state:

formula_20,

where formula_21, the friction angle, is the angle between the contact force and the contact normal direction.

formula_22, which describes the angle that if the tangential force falls within the friction cone the particles would still remain steady. It is determined by the coefficient of friction formula_23, so formula_24. Once stress is applied to the system then formula_21 gradually increases while formula_26 remains unchanged. When formula_27 then the particles will begin sliding, resulting in changing the structure of the system and creating new force chains. formula_28, the horizontal and vertical displacements respectively satisfies

formula_29.

== Granular gases ==
If the granular material is driven harder such that contacts between the grains become highly infrequent, the material enters a gaseous state. Correspondingly, one can define a granular temperature equal to the root mean square of grain velocity fluctuations that is analogous to thermodynamic temperature. Unlike conventional gases, granular materials will tend to cluster and clump due to the dissipative nature of the collisions between grains. This clustering has some interesting consequences. For example, if a partially partitioned box of granular materials is vigorously shaken then grains will over time tend to collect in one of the partitions rather than spread evenly into both partitions as would happen in a conventional gas. This effect, known as the granular Maxwell&#x27;s demon, does not violate any thermodynamics principles since energy is constantly being lost from the system in the process.

=== Ulam Model ===
Consider formula_30 particles, particle formula_31 having energy formula_32. At some constant rate per unit time, randomly choose two particles formula_33 with energies formula_34 and compute the sum formula_35. Now, randomly distribute the total energy between the two particles: choose randomly formula_36 so that the first particle, after the collision, has energy formula_37, and the second formula_38.

The stochastic evolution equation:

formula_39,

where formula_40 is the collision rate, formula_41 is randomly picked from formula_42 (uniform distribution) and j is an index also randomly chosen from a uniform distribution. The average energy per particle: formula_43.

The second moment:

formula_44.

Now the time derivative of the second moment:

formula_45.

In steady state:

formula_46.

Solving the differential equation for the second moment:

formula_47.

However, instead of characterizing the moments, we can analytically solve the energy distribution, from the moment generating function. Consider the Laplace transform: formula_48,

where formula_49, and formula_50.

the n derivative:

formula_51,

now:

formula_52

formula_53

formula_54.

Solving for formula_55 with change of variables formula_56:

formula_57.

We will show that formula_58 (Boltzmann Distribution) by taking its Laplace transform and calculate the generating function:

formula_59.

== Jamming transition ==

Granular systems are known to exhibit jamming and undergo a jamming transition which is thought of as a thermodynamic phase transition to a jammed state. The transition is from fluid-like phase to a solid-like phase and it is controlled by temperature, formula_60, volume fraction, formula_61, and shear stress, formula_62. The normal phase diagram of glass transition is in the formula_63 plane and it is divided into a jammed state region and unjammed liquid state by a transition line. The phase diagram for granular matter lies in the formula_64 plane, and the critical stress curve formula_65 divides the state phase to jammed\unjammed region, which corresponds to granular solids\liquids respectively. For isotropically jammed granular system, when formula_61 is reduced around a certain point, formula_67, the bulk and shear moduli approach 0. The formula_67 point corresponds to the critical volume fraction formula_69. Define the distance to point formula_67, the critical volume fraction, formula_71. The behavior of granular systems near the formula_67 point was empirically found to resemble second-order transition: the bulk modulus shows a power law scaling with formula_73 and there are some divergent characteristics lengths when formula_73 approaches zero. While formula_69 is constant for an infinite system, for a finite system boundary effects result in a distribution of formula_69 over some range.

The Lubachevsky-Stillinger algorithm of jamming allows one to produce simulated jammed granular configurations.

== Pattern formation ==
Excited granular matter is a rich pattern-forming system. Some of the pattern-forming behaviours seen in granular materials are:
* The un-mixing or segregation of unlike grains under vibration and flow. An example of this is the so-called Brazil nut effect where Brazil nuts rise to the top of a packet of mixed nuts when shaken. The cause of this effect is that when shaken, granular (and some other) materials move in a circular pattern. Some larger materials (Brazil nuts) get stuck while going down the circle and therefore stay on the top.
* The formation of structured surface or bulk patterns in vibrated granular layers. These patterns include but are not limited to stripes, squares and hexagons. These patterns are thought to be formed by fundamental excitations of the surface known as oscillons. The formation of ordered volumetric structures in granular materials is known as Granular Crystallisation, and involves a transition from a random packing of particles to an ordered packing such as hexagonal close-packed or body-centred cubic. This is most commonly observed in granular materials with narrow size distributions and uniform grain morphology.
* The formation of sand ripples, dunes, and sandsheets
Some of the pattern-forming behaviours have been possible to reproduce in computer simulations. There are two main computational approaches to such simulations, time-stepped and event-driven, the former being the most efficient for a higher density of the material and the motions of a lower intensity, and the latter for a lower density of the material and the motions of a higher intensity.

=== Acoustic effects ===
Some beach sands, such as those of the aptly named Squeaky Beach, exhibit squeaking when walked upon. Some desert dunes are known to exhibit booming during avalanching or when their surface is otherwise disturbed. Granular materials discharged from silos produce loud acoustic emissions in a process known as silo honking.

== Granulation ==

Granulation is the act or process in which primary powder particles are made to adhere to form larger, multiparticle entities called &quot;granules.&quot;

== Crystallization ==
When water or other liquids are cooled sufficiently slowly, randomly positioned molecules rearrange and solid crystals emerge and grow. A similar crystallisation process may occur in randomly packed granular materials. Unlike removing energy by cooling, crystallization in granular material is achieved by external driving. Ordering, or crystallization of granular materials has been observed to occur in periodically sheared as well as vibrated granular matter. In contrast to molecular systems, the positions of the individual particles can be tracked in the experiment. Computer simulations for a system of spherical grains reveal that homogeneous crystallization emerges at a volume fraction formula_77. The computer simulations identify the minimal ingredients necessary for granular crystallization. In particular, gravity and friction are not necessary.

== Computational modeling of granular materials ==

Several methods are available for modeling of granular materials. Most of these methods consist of the statistical methods by which various statistical properties, derived from either point data or an image, are extracted and used to generate stochastic models of the granular medium. A recent and comprehensive review of such methods is available in Tahmasebi and other (2017). Another alternative for building a pack of granular particles that recently has been presented is based on the level-set algorithm by which the real shape of the particle can be captured and reproduced through the extracted statistics for particles&#x27; morphology.

<doc id="696450" wikidata="Q7568986" url="?curid=696450" title="South Yarra railway station">
<text>South Yarra railway station is a commuter railway station and the junction point for the Cranbourne, Frankston, Pakenham and Sandringham lines, part of the Melbourne railway network. It serves the southern Melbourne suburb of South Yarra in Victoria, Australia. South Yarra is a ground-level premium station featuring six platforms, with two island platforms and two side platforms accessible by an overground concourse. It opened on 22 December 1860.

== History ==
South Yarra station was opened by the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company as Gardiners Creek Road. Initially, it served the Brighton line, on what was called the &quot;Prahran Branch&quot;. On 1 January 1867, the station was renamed South Yarra. The private railway company, by then the Melbourne and Hobson&#x27;s Bay United Railway Company, was taken over by the Government of Victoria in 1878, and its network became part of the Victorian Railways.

In 1924, historian John Cooper noted that when the South Yarra to Oakleigh line was first constructed, a set of points connected the line to the existing Brighton line. However, a high embankment obscured the vision of train drivers approaching South Yarra on both lines. To solve that problem, it was decided that the Oakleigh line should have its own tracks into Melbourne, and the Cremorne Railway Bridge, spanning the Yarra River, was duplicated to allow that.
The opening of the South Yarra to Oakleigh line in 1879 made the proposed Outer Circle line largely redundant, but it was constructed anyway, a decade later.

In 1914, the line between South Yarra and Caulfield was completely rebuilt. The works included the quadruplication of the line, and the reconstruction of the stations at Hawksburn, Toorak, Armadale and Malvern.

In 1946, the current Cremorne Railway Bridge over the Yarra River was opened, replacing the earlier one. In 1947, a works siding opened, which was disconnected in 1955.

Even after the laying of six tracks from Richmond to South Yarra, and the abolition of the signal box, the station retained three emergency crossovers at the up end of Platforms 1 and 2, 3 and 4 and 5 and 6. The latter set was removed in 1983, followed by the middle pair by 23 June 1984, and the final set in August 1986. The crossovers were originally provided in 1945 and 1960. Also in 1960, the &quot;local lines&quot;, used by Pakenham and Cranbourne line services, were extended to Richmond, and the signal box, located at the up end of Platforms 4 and 5, was closed, but still remains in place.

In 1993, there were major re-signalling works between South Yarra and Toorak, with similar works occurring between South Yarra and Richmond in 1994. In 1997, South Yarra was upgraded to a premium station. As such, the station is staffed from the first to the last service each day.

According to Public Transport Victoria data, South Yarra is the eighth-busiest station on the Melbourne metropolitan network, with 4.59 million boardings per year during the 2017/2018 financial year.

In early 2020, it was announced that South Yarra was to undergo a $12 million refurbishment. The entrance to the station on Toorak Road was to be widened, and the layout changed to make the station larger.

Services on the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines will no longer stop at South Yarra when the Metro Tunnel opens, which is scheduled to take place in 2025. The entrance portal to the Metro Tunnel is located near the station, but South Yarra will not be integrated into the new tunnel, which generated some criticism.

== Platforms and services ==
South Yarra station has six platforms: two side platforms and two island platforms with four faces. It is served by Cranbourne, Frankston, Pakenham and Sandringham line trains. V/Line&#x27;s Bairnsdale rail services (Gippsland line) pass non-stop through the station.

Platform 1:
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 2:
* all stations services to Sandringham

Platform 3:
* all stations services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 4:
* all stations and limited express services to Frankston

Platform 5:
* all stations services to Flinders Street
* all stations services to Flinders Street

Platform 6:

<doc id="696458" wikidata="Q648681" url="?curid=696458" title="Administrative districts of Serbia">
<text>The [[administrative district|administrative districts]] () of Serbia are the country&#x27;s first-level administrative division. The term &quot;okrug&quot; (pl. &quot;okruzi&quot;) means &quot;circuit&quot; and corresponds (in literal meaning) to in the German language. It can be translated as &quot;county&quot;, though it is generally rendered by the government as &quot;district&quot;. Prior to a 2006 decree, the administrative districts were named simply districts.

The local government reforms of 1992, going into effect the following year, created 29 districts, with the City of Belgrade having similar status. Following the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, the districts created by the UNMIK-Administration were adopted by Kosovo. The Serbian government does not recognize these districts.

The administrative districts are generally named after historical and geographical regions, though some, such as the Pčinja District and the Nišava District, are named after local rivers. Their areas and populations vary, ranging from the relatively-small Podunavlje District to the much larger Zlatibor District.

As they are mere designations of territorial remit of regional administrative centres through which the central government exercises its power within a hierarchical order, the districts are distinctly not units of regional self-governance, and as such they do not have flags. Still, they are each run by a commissioner as well as cooperating municipal leaders. Rather than being further divisible into municipalities, each district overlaps with its corresponding cluster of municipalities (which are units of local self-government).

==Definition==
Administrative districts were first defined by the Government of Serbia&#x27;s decree of 29 January 1992, which specifies that ministries and other national-level agencies shall conduct their affairs outside their headquarters (i.e. outside the seat of government) via regional offices that they may establish per the designated clusters of municipalities (named only &quot;districts&quot;), also designating the administrative seat of each district (&quot;regional centre of state administration&quot;). The 2005 Law on Public Administration provided a legal definition of a district, under the term &quot;administrative district&quot;.

In 2006, the Government enacted the Decree on Administrative Districts, which renamed the districts into &quot;administrative districts&quot;.

The territorial organisation of Serbia is regulated by the Law on Territorial Organisation, adopted by the National Assembly on 29 December 2007. According to the Law, the territorial organisation of the republic comprises municipalities and cities, the City of Belgrade with special status, and autonomous provinces. Districts are not mentioned in this law.

==List of districts==
Under the Law on Public Administration, administrative districts are formed by the Government by its Decree on Administrative Districts, which also determines the territory and head office of each administrative district. There are 29 administrative districts in the Republic of Serbia.

<text>Martin Clark (born 27 October 1968) is an English organiser of snooker tournaments and retired professional snooker player.

==Career==
Clark reached ten ranking tournament quarter-finals in his career, but never progressed any further. He reached the last 16 of the World Championship three times – 1991, 1992 and 1993, and also in 1992 reached the first major semi-final of his career at the World Matchplay by knocking out defending champion Gary Wilkinson. He won two non-ranking events, defeating Ray Reardon in the final of the European Grand Masters in 1990 and Andy Hicks in the Pontins Professional in 1997.

He retired as a pro player at a relatively young age, due to neck problems, and is now a tournament director. He has also helped with equipment maintenance (e.g. checking the replacement cloths) at the World Snooker Championship.

In November 2017, Belgian player Luca Brecel was forced to borrow clothes from Clark and fellow player Michael White after lifting the wrong suitcase at an airport in Shanghai.

<doc id="696462" wikidata="Q5685248" url="?curid=696462" title="Hawksburn railway station">
<text>Hawksburn railway station is a commuter railway station located in the southern Melbourne suburb of South Yarra in Victoria, Australia. Hawksburn is a below ground unstaffed station, featuring four platforms with an island platform and two side platforms accessible by a pedestrian bridge. The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, and was opened on 7 May 1879.

The stations&#x27; namesake is the locality of Hawksburn, situated 600 metres from the station. The station is only partially accessible due to multiple steep access ramps.


There are two principal station buildings, one of which is located on the stations central island platform (platforms 2 and 3) consisting of a small two story brick building, whilst the other is a one story brick structure situated on platform 4. These buildings were provided for the station in 1914, as ticketing and staff offices. 

Hawksburn is served by the Frankston line, part of the Melbourne railway network. Although Cranbourne and Pakenham lines do run through the station, these services are express and do not stop. The journey to Flinders Street railway station is approximately 5.3 kilometres (3.29 mi) and takes 9 minutes.

== Description ==
Hawksburn railway station is located in the suburb of South Yarra, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The station is located nearby to the Hawksburn shopping precinct and the Prahran Housing Commission Estate. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The station is approximately 5.3 kilometres (3.29 mi), or an 9-minute train journey, from Flinders Street station. The adjacent stations are South Yarra station up towards Melbourne, and Toorak station down towards Frankston.

The station consists of a single island platform and two side platforms with a total of four platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately long, enough for a Metro Trains 7 car HCMT. The station features a pedestrian bridge, accessed from the centre of the platforms by a ramp. The station features two principal station buildings, both former ticketing offices which are now heritage listed staff facilities. Distinct Edwardian architectural features of the red brick station buildings include ornate parapets, cement banding, tall chimneys with terracotta pots, tiled hip roof with terracotta finials, and stucco walls.

The station building, platform, and overpass are largely the same as when originally built, with the main change being updated signage, technology, and the addition of one new platform canopy amongst other minor building and platform upgrades. There is no car parking available at the station. The station is listed as an &quot;assisted access&quot; station on the Metro Trains website, as the access ramp is too steep and would require assistance for wheelchair customers to traverse.

== History ==
Hawksburn railway station was opened on 7 May 1879 with the station consisting of a single platform and track for commuter and freight service. Like the locality itself, the station was named after Hawksburn Estate, where the station is located. The first station buildings were opened on the site between 1881 and 1883 to coincide with the duplication of track between the city and Oakleigh. The current station was constructed in 1914 to provide improved and additional facilities to what had become an increasingly busy and important location on the train network. The station rebuild was part of level crossing removal works that removed all level crossings, rebuilt all stations, and quadruplicated the corridor between South Yarra and Caulfield by 1914. Later in 1922, the line was electrified using 1500 V DC overhead wires with three position signalling also introduced.


The station has mostly stayed the same since 1914, with only minor upgrades taking place. In 1972, the island platform (Platforms 2 and 3) was extended at both ends. In 1993, major re-signalling works occurred between South Yarra and Toorak stations. The station underwent minor upgrades with the installation of one new shelter on Platform 1 in the 2010s. In 2021, resignalling works occurred to upgrade the corridor to high capacity signalling as part of the Metro Tunnel project.

== Platforms and services ==
Hawksburn has two side platforms and one island platform with four faces. The station is currently served by the Frankston line—a service on the metropolitan rail network. The Frankston line runs from Frankston station south east of Melbourne, joining the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines at Caulfield station before continuing onto the Werribee or Williamstown lines via Flinders Street station. Despite the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines operating through the station, these services no longer stop at the station due to low station patronage, instead running express through the station.

<doc id="696464" wikidata="Q7604529" url="?curid=696464" title="Status group">
<text>The German sociologist Max Weber formulated a three-component theory of stratification that defines a status group (also status class and [[Estates of the realm|status estate]]) as a group of people within a society who can be differentiated by non-economic qualities such as honour, prestige, ethnicity, race, and religion. The German terms are &quot;Stand&quot; (status group) and &quot;Stände&quot; (status groups)

To date, sociologists study the matter of “status incongruence” — both in post-industrial societies, and in pre-industrial societies. Status groups emerge from &quot;the house of honor&quot;, and that such status-honor stands in contrast with:
* social class, based on economically determined relationship in the house of the marketplace
* political party, based on affiliations in the political domain, or the house of power

Status groups, social classes, and political parties are the constituent concepts of the three-component theory of stratification. Discussion of the relationships among status groups, social class, and political parties occurs in Weber&#x27;s essay &quot;Class, Status, Party&quot;, written before the First World War (1914–18); the first translation into English, by Hans Gerth and C. Wright Mills, was published in the 1940s. Dagmar Waters and colleagues produced a newer English translation of the essay, titled “The Distribution of Power within the Community: Classes, Stände, Parties” (2010), published in the “Journal of Classical Sociology”; the title of the new English-language translation includes the German word “Stände” (status groups) in place of the English term.

Status groups feature in the varieties of social stratification addressed in popular literature and in the academic literature, such as categorization of people by race, ethnic group, racial caste, professional groups, community groups, nationalities, etc. These contrast with relationships rooted in economic relations, which Weber calls &quot;class&quot;.

Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu discusses cultural capital and symbolic capital. Like Weber, he comments on how non-monetary means are used to confer and deny status to individuals and groups.

<doc id="696467" wikidata="Q648758" url="?curid=696467" title="North Bačka District">
<text>The North Bačka District (, ; ) is one of seven administrative districts of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. It lies in the Bačka geographical region. According to the 2022 census results, it has a population of 160,163 inhabitants. The administrative center of the district is the city of Subotica.

==Administrative history==
In the 9th century, the area was ruled by the Bulgarian-Slavic duke Salan. From the 11th to the 16th century, during the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, the area was divided between the Bodrogiensis County, Bacsensis County, Csongradiensis County, and Cumania region. From 1526 to 1527, the area was ruled by the independent Serb ruler, emperor Jovan Nenad, while during Ottoman administration (16th-17th century), it was part of the Sanjak of Segedin.

During Habsburg administration (18th century), the area was divided between the Military Frontier and the Batsch County. The Batsch County was joined with the Bodrog County into the single Batsch-Bodrog County in the 18th century. Since the abolishment of the Theiß-Marosch section of the Military Frontier in 1751, part of that territory was also included into the Batsch-Bodrog County. In the 1850s, the area was part of the Sombor District, and after 1860, it was again included into Batsch-Bodrog County.

During the royal Serb-Croat-Slovene (Yugoslav) administration (1918-1941), the area was part of the Novi Sad County (1918-1922), Bačka Oblast (1922-1929), and Danube Banovina (1929-1941).

During the Hungarian-German Axis occupation (1941-1944), the area was included into Bács-Bodrog County. From 1944, the area was part of the autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina (which was part of the new socialist Yugoslav Serbia from 1945). The present-day districts of Serbia (including the North Bačka District) were defined by the Government of Serbia&#x27;s Enactment of 29 January 1992.

==Municipalities==
The North Bačka District comprises three municipalities and 45 local communities. The municipalities are:
* Subotica (Hungarian: &quot;Szabadka&quot;)
* Bačka Topola (Hungarian: &quot;Topolya&quot;)
* Mali Iđoš (Hungarian: &quot;Kishegyes&quot;)

==Demographics==

According to the last official censuses done in 2011 and 2022, the North Bačka District had 186,906 and 160,163 inhabitants respectively.

===Ethnic groups===
The population of the district is ethnically mixed.
===Languages===
Languages spoken in the district (2022 census): 
*Serbian — 86,005 (53.69%)
*Hungarian — 56,398 (35.21%)
*Croatian — 4,010 (2.50%)
*Other

(*) The total number of speakers of South Slavic languages (Serbian and Croatian) that live in the district is 90,015 (56.20%).

===Religion===
Religion (2002 census):
*Roman Catholic = 117,456 (58.69%)
*Orthodox = 55,028 (27.50%)
*Protestant = 9,844 (4.92%)
*Other

===Municipalities and local communities===
As of 2002, two municipalities have a Hungarian ethnic majority: Bačka Topola (58.94%) and Mali Iđoš (55.92%), while one municipality (Subotica) is ethnically mixed. The population of Subotica is composed of: Hungarians (38.47%), Serbs (24.14%), Croats (11.24%), Bunjevci (10.95%), Yugoslavs (5.76%), Montenegrins (1.25%), and others.

As for local communities, 20 have a Hungarian majority, 15 have a Serb majority, seven have Croatian/Bunjevci majority, one has a Montenegrin majority and two are ethnically mixed, with a Hungarian relative majority.

==Culture==
Subotica is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious center; in addition to the major Roman Catholic and Serbian Orthodox communities, there are nearly thirty other small-sized religious communities in the town. The most remarkable religious buildings are Subotica Synagogue, Cathedral of Saint Teresa of Avila from 1797, a Franciscan Monastery from 1736, and St Dimitrije Serbian Orthodox Church in Aleksandrovo neighborhood from 1818.

==Economy==
In accordance with its very rich resources, the region&#x27;s food processing industry is well developed. The best examples are &quot;29 November&quot; meat industry, &quot;Pionir&quot; food factory and &quot;Fidelinka&quot; bread and flour products factory. Subotica ranks among the leading communities in Serbia when it comes to crop yields (maize, wheat and sunflower).

<doc id="696472" wikidata="Q1151112" url="?curid=696472" title="Axiom of constructibility">
<text>The axiom of constructibility is a possible axiom for set theory in mathematics that asserts that every set is constructible. The axiom is usually written as V&quot; = &quot;L. The axiom, first investigated by Kurt Gödel, is inconsistent with the proposition that zero sharp exists and stronger large cardinal axioms (see list of large cardinal properties). Generalizations of this axiom are explored in inner model theory.

== Implications ==
The axiom of constructibility implies the axiom of choice (AC), given Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (ZF). It also settles many natural mathematical questions that are independent of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC); for example, the axiom of constructibility implies the generalized continuum hypothesis, the negation of Suslin&#x27;s hypothesis, and the existence of an analytical (in fact, formula_1) non-measurable set of real numbers, all of which are independent of ZFC.

The axiom of constructibility implies the non-existence of those large cardinals with consistency strength greater or equal to 0#, which includes some &quot;relatively small&quot; large cardinals. For example, no cardinal can be ω1-Erdős in &quot;L&quot;. While &quot;L&quot; does contain the initial ordinals of those large cardinals (when they exist in a supermodel of &quot;L&quot;), and they are still initial ordinals in &quot;L&quot;, it excludes the auxiliary structures (e.g. measures) that endow those cardinals with their large cardinal properties.

Although the axiom of constructibility does resolve many set-theoretic questions, it is not typically accepted as an axiom for set theory in the same way as the ZFC axioms. Among set theorists of a realist bent, who believe that the axiom of constructibility is either true or false, most believe that it is false. This is in part because it seems unnecessarily &quot;restrictive&quot;, as it allows only certain subsets of a given set (for example, formula_2 can&#x27;t exist), with no clear reason to believe that these are all of them. In part it is because the axiom is contradicted by sufficiently strong large cardinal axioms. This point of view is especially associated with the Cabal, or the &quot;California school&quot; as Saharon Shelah would have it.

== In arithmetic ==
Especially from the 1950s to the 1970s, there have been some investigations into formulating an analogue of the axiom of constructibility for subsystems of second-order arithmetic. A few results stand out in the study of such analogues:

* John Addison&#x27;s formula_3 formula formula_4 such that formula_5 iff formula_6, i.e. formula_7 is a constructible real.

* There is a formula_8 formula known as the &quot;analytical form of the axiom of constructibility&quot; that has some associations to the set-theoretic axiom V=L. For example, some cases where formula_9 iff formula_10 have been given.

== Significance ==
The major significance of the axiom of constructibility is in Kurt Gödel&#x27;s 1938 proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis to Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory. (The proof carries over to Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, which has become more prevalent in recent years.)

Namely Gödel proved that formula_11 is relatively consistent (i.e. if formula_12 can prove a contradiction, then so can formula_13), and that in formula_13

:formula_15

thereby establishing that AC and GCH are also relatively consistent.

Gödel&#x27;s proof was complemented in 1962 by Paul Cohen&#x27;s result that both AC and GCH are &quot;independent&quot;, i.e. that the negations of these axioms (formula_16 and formula_17) are also relatively consistent to ZF set theory.

== Statements true in &quot;L&quot; ==

Here is a list of propositions that hold in the constructible universe (denoted by &quot;L&quot;):

* The generalized continuum hypothesis and as a consequence
** The axiom of choice
* Diamondsuit
** Clubsuit
* Global square
* The existence of morasses
* The negation of the Suslin hypothesis
* The non-existence of 0# and as a consequence
** The non existence of all large cardinals that imply the existence of a measurable cardinal
* The existence of a formula_18 set of reals (in the analytical hierarchy) that is not measurable.
* The truth of Whitehead&#x27;s conjecture that every abelian group &quot;A&quot; with Ext1(&quot;A&quot;, Z) = 0 is a free abelian group.
* The existence of a definable well-order of all sets (the formula for which can be given explicitly). In particular, &quot;L&quot; satisfies V=HOD.
* The existence of a primitive recursive class surjection formula_19, i.e. a class function from Ord whose range contains all sets. 

Accepting the axiom of constructibility (which asserts that every set is constructible) these propositions also hold in the von Neumann universe, resolving many propositions in set theory and some interesting questions in analysis.

<doc id="696480" wikidata="Q14935301" url="?curid=696480" title="Toorak railway station">
<text>Toorak railway station is a commuter railway station on the northern boundary of Armadale, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The station is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, and was opened on 7 May 1879. The station is named after the nearby suburb of Toorak—located north of the station. The station consists of an island platform and two side platforms all accessed by a pedestrian bridge. There are two principal station buildings located on the central platform (platforms 2 and 3) and on platform 4, consisting of a small two and one-story brick buildings. These buildings were provided in 1914, as ticketing and staff offices. The station is only partially accessible due to a multiple steep access ramps.

Toorak railway station is served by the Frankston line, part of the Melbourne railway network. The station also connects to the Route 72 tram service and the route 604 and 605 bus services. The journey to Flinders Street railway station is approximately 6.5 kilometres (4.04 mi) and takes 11 minutes.

== Description ==
Toorak railway station is on the boundary of Armadale, Toorak, and Prahran suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. The station is located nearby to the Beatty Avenue shopping precinct, Orrong Romanis Reserve, and Toorak Park. The station is owned by VicTrack, a state government agency, and the station is operated by Metro Trains. The station is approximately 6.5 kilometres (4.04 mi), or an 11-minute train journey, from Flinders Street station. The adjacent stations are Hawksburn station up towards Melbourne, and Armadale station down towards Frankston.

The station consists of a single island platform and two side platforms with a total of four platform edges. Standard in Melbourne, the platform has an asphalt surface with concrete on the edges. The platforms are approximately 160 metres (524.93 ft) long, enough for a Metro Trains 7 car HCMT. The station features a pedestrian bridge, accessed from the centre of the platforms by a ramp. The station features two principal station buildings, both former ticketing offices which are now heritage listed staff facilities. Distinct Edwardian architectural features of the red brick station buildings include ornate parapets, cement banding, tall chimneys with terracotta pots, tiled hip roof with terracotta finials, and stucco walls.

The station building, platform, and overpass are largely the same as when originally built, with the main change being updated signage, technology, and the addition of two new platform canopy amongst other minor building and platform upgrades. There is no car parking available at the station. The station is listed as an &quot;assisted access&quot; station on the Metro Trains website, as the access ramp is too steep and would require assistance for wheelchair customers to traverse.

==History==

Toorak railway station was opened on 7 May 1879, with the station consisting of a single platform and track for commuter and freight service. Like the adjacent suburb itself, the station was named after Toorak House, built by merchant James Jackson in 1849. The name is believed to be an Indigenous word meaning &#x27;reedy swamp&#x27; or &#x27;black crow&#x27;. The first station buildings were opened on the site between 1881 and 1883 to coincide with the duplication of track between the city and Oakleigh. The current station was constructed in 1914 to provide improved and additional facilities to what had become an increasingly busy and important location on the train network. The station rebuild was part of level crossing removal works that removed all level crossings, rebuilt all stations, and quadruplicated the corridor between South Yarra and Caulfield by 1914. Later in 1922, the line was electrified using 1500 V DC overhead wires with three position signalling also introduced.

In 1976, debate regarding the name of the station occurred as the station is located in the nearby suburb of Armadale. Suggestions were made about renaming the station, including naming the station after Albert Jacka, Australia&#x27;s first recipient of the Victoria Cross, who was mayor of the former St Kilda Council. These calls never eventuated, with Toorak station retaining its name with little conversation regarding its naming taking place since.

The station has mostly stayed the same since 1914, with only minor upgrades taking place. In 1972, the island platform (Platforms 2 and 3) was extended at both ends. In 1977, a former goods siding and associated point work were permanently closed before being removed due to limited use. In 1993, major re-signalling works occurred between South Yarra and Toorak stations, with similar works occurring between Toorak and Caulfield stations in that same year. The station underwent minor upgrades with the installation of two new shelters on Platform 1 in the 2010s. In 2021, resignalling works occurred to upgrade the corridor to high capacity signalling as part of the Metro Tunnel project.

In the mid-2010s, rezoning by Stonnington Council allowed for higher density development next to Toorak station. This allowed for the construction of 446 apartments and 18 townhouses across numerous towers by developer Lendlease. These towers have contributed to an increase in patronage and added density on an otherwise under-utilised site.

== Platforms and services ==
Toorak has two side platforms and one island platform with four faces. The station is currently served by the Frankston line—a service on the metropolitan rail network. The Frankston line runs from Frankston station south east of Melbourne, joining the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines at Caulfield station before continuing onto the Werribee or Williamstown lines via Flinders Street station. Despite the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines operating through the station, these services no longer stop at the station due to low station patronage, instead running express through the station.

Platform 1:

* all stations services to Flinders Street, Werribee and Williamstown

Platform 2:

* all stations services to Frankston

Platform 3:

* No services stop at this platform. Cranbourne and Pakenham line services run express through this station.

Platform 4:

* No services stop at this platform. Cranbourne and Pakenham line services run express through this station.

==Transport links==
Toorak station has one tram and two bus connections. The route 72 tram service operates from nearby Malvern Road up towards the city and down towards Camberwell. The station also connects to the route 605 bus service from Gardenvale to the Melbourne CBD (on Queen Street) and the route 604 bus from Gardenvale to The Alfred Hospital. The station does not have an accessible tram platform or a bus interchange, and instead is operated through on-street bus and tram stops. Toorak station also has train replacement bus stops located adjacent to the station.

Tram connections:

* : Melbourne University – Camberwell

Bus connections:

* : Gardenvale – The Alfred Hospital (Until 16 November 2024) (From 17 November 2024 to Anzac Station and Elsternwick Station)
* : Gardenvale – Melbourne CBD (Queen Street) (Until 16 November 2024) (From 17 November 2024 to Queen Victoria Market)

<text>Tony Jones (born 15 April 1960) is an English former professional snooker player.

==Career==
In 1983, Jones became the English Amateur Champion, beating John Parrott 13–9. He was also a World Championship doubles finalist (with partner Ray Reardon) in 1985.

Jones was the surprise winner of the 1991 European Open when, ranked no. 35 in the world, he beat Mark Johnston-Allen 9–7, despite never having previously been beyond the quarter-final stage of a ranking tournament. He reached no. 15 in the 1991/1992 rankings as a result, but dropped out of the top sixteen the following season. Despite a quarter-final appearance at the 1996 Grand Prix, he gradually slid down the rankings and lost his professional status in 2004.

<doc id="696488" wikidata="Q728041" url="?curid=696488" title="North Banat District">
<text>The North Banat District (, ; ) is one of seven administrative districts of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. It lies in the geographical regions of Banat and Bačka. According to the 2022 census, the district has a population of 117,896 inhabitants. The administrative center of the district is the city of Kikinda.

==Administrative history==
In the 9th century, the area was ruled by the Bulgarian-Slavic dukes Glad (in the east) and Salan (in the west), while in the 11th century, the eastern part of the area was ruled by duke Ahtum. From the 11th to the 16th century, during the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, the area was divided between the Csanadiensis County, Temesiensis County and Torontaliensis County in the east, and the Csongradiensis County, Bacsensis County and Bodrogiensis County in the west. Part of the area was also located within the Cumania region. From 1526 to 1527, the area was ruled by the independent Serb ruler, emperor Jovan Nenad, while during Ottoman administration (16th-18th century), it was divided between the Temeşvar Eyalet in the east and the Sanjak of Segedin in the west.

During Habsburg administration (18th century), the area was divided between the Banat of Temeswar in the east and the Military Frontier in the west. Since the abolishment of the Theiß-Marosch section of the Military Frontier (in 1751), and the abolishment of the Banat of Temeswar (in 1778), the area was divided between the Torontal County in the east and the Batsch-Bodrog County in the west, with a small part of it located within the Tschongrad County. Much of the area was part of the autonomous districts of Velika Kikinda (existed from 1774 to 1876 within the Torontal County) in the east and Potisje (existed from 1751 to 1848 within the Batsch-Bodrog County) in the west. In the 1850s, the area was divided between the Veliki Bečkerek District in the east and the Sombor and Novi Sad districts in the west. After 1860, it was again divided between Torontal, Batsch-Bodrog and Tschongrad counties.

During the Yugoslav administration (1918-1941), the area was initially (from 1918 to 1922) divided between the Veliki Bečkerek County in the east and the Novi Sad County in the west. From 1922 to 1929, it was part of the Belgrade Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina.

During the German-Hungarian Axis occupation (1941-1944), the area was divided between the Banat autonomous region (part of the German-occupied puppet state of Serbia) in the east and the Bács-Bodrog County (an administrative unit of Horthy&#x27;s Hungary) in the west. Initially, the Banat region was part of the rump Danube Banovina (whose capital was moved to Smederevo), but from December 1941, it was organized as one of the districts of Serbia and was officially named the District of Veliki Bečkerek.

From 1944, the area was part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina (which was part of the new socialist Yugoslav Serbia from 1945). The present-day districts of Serbia (including the North Banat District) were defined by the Government of Serbia&#x27;s Enactment of 29 January 1992.

==Municipalities==
The North Banat District comprises the city of Kikinda, five municipalities and 50 local communities. The municipalities are
* Kanjiža (Hungarian: &quot;Magyarkanizsa&quot;)
* Senta (Hungarian: &quot;Zenta&quot;)
* Ada (Hungarian: &quot;Ada&quot;)
* Čoka (Hungarian: &quot;Csóka&quot;)
* Novi Kneževac

Note: for the municipalities with a Hungarian ethnic majority, the names are also given in Hungarian.

An interesting fact is that the first three municipalities enlisted (Kanjiža, Senta and Ada) are geographically, in fact, in the Bačka region, since the natural border between Banat and Bačka is the river Tisa.

==Demographics==

According to the last official census done in 2022, the North Banat District has 117,896 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
With the results of the 2011 census, Hungarians were the largest ethnic group in the district at 46.64%, closely followed by Serbs at 42.67%. The municipalities with a Serb ethnic majority are Kikinda (75.43%) and Novi Kneževac (57.19%), while the municipalities with a Hungarian ethnic majority are: Čoka (49.66%), Ada (75.03%), Senta (79.09%) and Kanjiža (85.13%). As for the local communities, 29 have a Hungarian majority, 19 have a Serb majority, and 2 are ethnically mixed, with a Hungarian relative majority.

The results of the 2022 census registered Serbs as the largest ethnic group at 44%, followed by Hungarians at 43%.

The ethnic composition of the district (as of the 2011 and 2022 censuses):
==Culture==
The first modern Serb printing house was founded in Kikinda in 1878, to be followed a year later by the opening of the first library.

This city is also reputable for its painters, including Teodor Ilić Češljar, Nikola Aleksić, Đura Pecić, and Đura Jakšić, a painter and author.

Kikinda was the scene of the region&#x27;s first theatrical performance, given in German, in 1796.

<text>Clifford Wilson (10 May 193421 May 1994) was a Welsh professional snooker player who reached the highest ranking of 16, in 1988-89. He was the 1978 World Amateur Champion and won the 1991 World Seniors Championship. He was a successful junior player, known for his fast attacking snooker and ability, and won the British Under-19 Championship in 1951 and 1952. In the early 1950s both Wilson and future six-times World Professional Champion Ray Reardon lived in Tredegar, where they played a succession of money matches that attracted large enthusiastic crowds.

A combination of factors, including Reardon leaving Tredegar, led to Wilson virtually giving up the game from 1957 to 1972, but after being asked to take up a vacant place in a works team, he returned to playing and later became the 1978 World Amateur Champion, achieving his victory with an 11–5 win in the final against Joe Johnson. In 1979 Wilson turned professional, aged 45, and, still playing with an attacking style, reached several ranking tournament quarter-finals during his career. At the inaugural World Seniors Championship in 1991 he beat Eddie Charlton 5–4 in the final to take the title. He won the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1956, 1977 and 1979, and was runner-up in the Welsh Professional Championship in 1981 and 1984. He suffered from a number of health conditions, including poor eyesight, during his career, but continued to play professionally until his death in 1994 at the age of 60.

== Amateur years ==
Wilson was born on 10 May 1934 and grew up in Tredegar, the same town as his friend and snooker rival Ray Reardon. He learnt to play snooker in a steelworks club-room. Even as a teenager, Wilson was nearly sightless in his left eye. In 1950, aged 16, Wilson was the reigning Welsh boys snooker champion and working as a storekeeper when he reached the final of the British under-19 Championship, where he lost 2–3 to Rex Williams. In the same competition the following year, Wilson (now a steelworker) won the title, defeating Gary Owen 3–2 in the final. In 1952 he beat Owen on his way to reaching the semi-final of the English Amateur Championship, where, using a cue that had been repaired overnight and reduced in length by an inch, he lost to Charles Downey.

Having been called up into the Royal Air Force for his national service, Wilson was granted special leave to participate in the 1952 under-19 Championship. In the final he faced Owen again, this time winning 4–2. A match report of Wilson&#x27;s 3–1 semi-final win against Donald Scott in the &quot;Western Mail&quot; said that he played &quot;spectacular snooker … he had breaks of 20, 25, 30 and 41 all at tremendous speed.&quot; In 1954, Wilson was the youngest competitor in the English Amateur Championship and lost 9–11 to Geoff Thompson in the final. He won the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1956. Snooker historian Clive Everton wrote of Wilson&#x27;s early career that he was &quot;a phenomenal potter: quick, instinctive fearless.&quot; 

He played Reardon in a succession of money matches in Tredegar. In &quot;The Story of Billiards and Snooker&quot;, Everton described Wilson as being an &quot;even more remarkable talent&quot; than Reardon, who would go on to win the World Snooker Championship six times between 1969 and 1978. Everton went on to describe their contests, when each would attract hundreds of supporting spectators, as &quot;modern snooker&#x27;s nearest equivalent to a bare knuckle prize fight.&quot; Everton then suggests that when Reardon moved away, &quot;the edge went from Wilson&#x27;s game.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s father, who had supported his son&#x27;s snooker career, died at around the time that Reardon moved away, and Wilson also started having problems with his eyesight. Apart from this, snooker&#x27;s popularity was on the wane during the 1950s and it was extremely difficult to join the small, closed professional circuit. Wilson gave up snooker almost completely, and continued working at the steelworks at Llanwern. From 1957 to 1972 he was retired from snooker apart from participating in a few games in 1960, which included the televised &quot;Snooker Foursomes&quot; in which he partnered John Price.

In 1972 he started playing again when a friend asked him to take a vacant place in a works team in the Newport League. Within two years of starting to play again, he was selected for the Wales team for the 1973–74 Home International series, losing 1–2 against D. Lenehan of Ireland and beating W. McKerron of Scotland 2–1. He was selected again in 1976–77 for the match against Ireland, beating J. Clusker 2–1. In 1977–78 Wales won the series, although Wilson lost two of his three matches, including a 1–2 defeat by 1972 and 1974 World Amateur Champion Ray Edmonds. In the 1978 series Wilson won three of his four matches, including a 3–0 win over the captain of the England team Mike Hallett. In 1977, he won his second Welsh amateur championship, following his earlier win in 1956, beating Dai Thomas 8–1 in the final.

As Welsh Champion, Wilson qualified for the 1978 World Amateur Championship in Malta. He was the only player in the three groups of the round-robin stage to win all of their matches, and then beat Maltese player Joe Grech 5–4 in the quarter-finals. Wilson built a 4–0 lead in front of a 4,000 strong audience that, according to Everton, started to deliberately distract him, as Grech levelled at 4–4 and led 37–0 in the deciding frame. Wilson eventually won the frame, and remained in the pressroom with Everton, guarded by police, until the audience left. He beat Kirk Stevens 8–2 in the semi-final and then Joe Johnson 11–5 in the final to take the title.

Following his world amateur championship win, Wilson was invited to participate in the 1979 Masters. He would have been the first amateur to play in the Masters, but withdrew due to a threatened boycott by professional players. He lost 5–8 in the southern area final of the English Amateur Championship to Jimmy White after leading 4–2. 1979 also saw him win the Welsh Amateur Championship for the third time, defeating Geoff Thomas 8–5 in the final; and take the National Pairs championship title with Steve Newbury.

== Professional career ==
Wilson turned professional in 1979 at the age of 45, and won his first match, 9–7 against John Pulman in the 1979 UK Championship, before losing 4–9 to Terry Griffiths in the following round. In his debut World Snooker Championship in 1980, he beat Frank Jonik 9–7 in qualifying and lost 6–10 to Doug Mountjoy in the first round. In the 1980–81 season, he reached the final of the 1981 Welsh Professional Championship, losing 6–9 to Reardon. He beat Roy Andrewartha and Eddie Sinclair, both 9–4, in qualifying for the 1981 World Snooker Championship and then was beaten 6–10 by David Taylor in the first round. In 1981–82 he again lost in the first round of the world championship, 5–10 to Eddie Charlton. Wilson was the runner-up at the Pontins Spring Open in consecutive years, losing 3–7 to Willie Thorne in 1980 and 2–7 to John Hargreaves in 1981.

With wins over Johnson, Mountjoy and White, Wilson reached his first ranking tournament quarter-final at the 1982 International Open, losing 4–5 to the eventual champion Tony Knowles. He next reached a ranking quarter final at the 1985 Grand Prix, with further losing quarter-final appearances at the 1986 International Open, 1987 classic, and 1989 International Open.

He broke into the top sixteen of the world rankings for one season, 1988/89, ranked 16th. This ranking entitled him to a place at the 1989 Masters, where he came back from 0-2 down to level at 2–2 against reigning World Champion and defending Masters Champion Steve Davis before Davis went on to win 5–2.

He later went on to win the first World Seniors Championship in 1991, beating Charlton 5–4 in the final after earlier victories over Mountjoy and Griffiths. Charlton had led 4-2 and needed only to pot the and for the match, but Wilson took three frames in a row to win his first professional title at the age of 57 and collect £16,000, his highest prize winnings.

He recorded wins over a number of prominent players as a professional. In January 1992 he beat Ken Doherty 5–2 in the 1992 Welsh Open before losing 1–5 to Darren Morgan. Later that year he played a young Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the 1992 UK Championship, winning 9–8. Both Doherty and O&#x27;Sullivan won the respective tournaments the following year. The highest break of his career was 136 at the 1989 Grand Prix.

His popular exhibition matches were advertised with the phrase &quot;You&#x27;ve never seen anything like it!&quot; He was known as a fast, attacking, player and has been described as an &quot;outstanding potter&quot; both by Everton and by snooker writer Ian Morrison. In 1953, a &quot;Sports Argus&quot; match report described Wilson as having &quot;lived up to his reputation as the finest potter in the country, one ball being hardly in the pocket before the next one was following it in.&quot; Wilson&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; noted that in the 1950s he was seen as a &quot;phenomenal talent&quot; and played an attacking game that was unlike the defensive approach generally prevalent at the time, and &quot;Eurosport&#x27;s&quot; Desmond Kane included him in a 2020 list of the ten &quot;greatest long potters&quot;. Jack Karnehm in 1981 wrote that Wilson was &quot;probably the hardest hitter of a ball on earth. His high-speed accurate potting has to be seen to be believed&quot; and added &quot;it is said that the last time he played a safety shot was in 1959 and that was by mistake.&quot;

==Personal life==
He was married to Valerie Wilson, and had four sons, including twins. Towards the end of his life, Wilson suffered from a number of problems with his back, knee and heart, eventually developing an &quot;inoperable disease of the liver and pancreas&quot; that led to his death. Although he continued to play professionally, recording a century break in the 1994 International Open in January 1994, he died in May of that year, aged 60.

<doc id="696501" wikidata="Q1347463" url="?curid=696501" title="Rugby Football Union">
<text>The Rugby Football Union (RFU) is the national governing body for rugby union in England. It was founded in 1871, and was the sport&#x27;s international governing body prior to the formation of what is now known as World Rugby (WR) in 1886. It promotes and runs the sport, organises international matches for the England national team, and educates and trains players and officials.

The RFU is an industrial and provident society owned by over 2,000 member clubs, representing over 2.5 million registered players, and forms the largest rugby union society in the world, and one of the largest sports organisations in England. It is based at Twickenham Stadium, London.

In September 2010 the equivalent women&#x27;s rugby body, the Rugby Football Union for Women (RFUW), was able to nominate a member to the RFU Council to represent women and girls rugby. The RFUW was integrated into the RFU in July 2012.

==Early history (19th century)==


===Formation===

On 4 December 1870, Edwin Ash of Richmond and Benjamin Burns of Blackheath published a letter in &quot;The Times&quot; suggesting that &quot;those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others, which makes the game difficult to play&quot;. On 26 January 1871 a meeting attended by representatives from 21 clubs was held in London at the Pall Mall Restaurant on Regent Street.
The 21 clubs present at the meeting were: Blackheath (represented by Burns and Frederick Stokes, the latter becoming the first captain of England), Richmond, Ravenscourt Park, West Kent, Marlborough Nomads, Wimbledon Hornets, Gipsies, Civil Service, The Law Club, Wellington College, Guy&#x27;s Hospital, Flamingoes, Clapham Rovers, Harlequin F.C., King&#x27;s College Hospital, St Paul&#x27;s, Queen&#x27;s House, Lausanne, Addison, Mohicans, and Belsize Park. The one notable omission was the Wasps. According to one version, a Wasps&#x27; representative was sent to attend the meeting, but owing to a misunderstanding was sent to the wrong venue at the wrong time on the wrong day; another version is that he went to a venue of the same name where, after consuming a number of drinks, he realised his mistake but was too drunk to make his way to the correct venue. Ealing Rugby Club (now Ealing Trailfinders) also received an invitation, but their representative stopped in a public house and also missed the meeting.
As a result of this meeting the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was founded. Algernon Rutter was elected as the first president of the RFU, and Edwin Ash was elected as treasurer. Three lawyers who were Rugby School alumni (Rutter, Holmes and L.J. Maton) drew up the first laws of the game, which were approved in June 1871.

Although similar unions were organised during the next few years in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, France, Canada, South Africa, and the United States, the RFU was the first and therefore had no need to distinguish itself from others by calling itself the English RFU.

===Northern clubs secede – Rugby League===
Twenty-two rugby clubs from across the north of England met on 29 August 1895 in the George Hotel in Huddersfield, where they voted to secede from the Rugby Football Union. The main reason for the split was the wish of players to be compensated for lost wages when playing Rugby. Many working class players in the North lost wages to play. The R.F.U. opposed players being paid. They set up the Northern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the Rugby Football League). The RFU took strong action against the clubs involved in the formation of the NRFU, all of whom were deemed to have forfeited their amateur status and therefore to have left the RFU. A similar interpretation was applied to all players who played either for or against such clubs, whether or not they received any compensation. These players were barred indefinitely from any involvement in organised rugby union. These comprehensive and enduring sanctions, combined with the very localised nature of most rugby competition, meant that most northern clubs had little practical option but to affiliate with the NRFU in the first few years of its existence.

==The modern era (1970 – present)==

The RFU long resisted competitions and leagues fearing that they would encourage foul play and professionalism. The first club competition, then known as the R.F.U. Club Competition, took place in 1972. Following a sponsorship agreement it became known as the John Player Cup in 1976.

The RFU agreed to the formation of a league pyramid in 1987.

Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex served as patron until February 2021.

Catherine, Princess of Wales took over the role as patron in February 2022.

In October 2024, England head coach Steve Borthwick announced the RFU would introduce Enhanced Elite Player Squad (EPS) contracts. This would allow national team coaches to have final say on all sports science and medical matters relating to players. Initially, 17 contracts were handed to current England players with Maro Itoje, Marcus Smith and England captain Jamie George all being among the recipients.

===Women===
In 2005 the RFU began talks about a merger with the governing body for women&#x27;s rugby union the RFUW. In September 2010 the RFUW was able to nominate a member to the RFU Council to represent women and girls rugby. The RFUW was integrated into the RFU in July 2012.

In July 2022, a vote of the RFU Council approved by a narrow margin to prohibit transgender women from playing in the female category, and to require a risk assessment for transgender men. The Liverpool Tritons, in coordination with International Gay Rugby, have condemned the decision and protested at Pride in Liverpool.

In September 2022, transgender player Julie Curtiss began a legal challenge to the ban on transgender women in female rugby by sending the RFU a pre-action protocol letter.

==Structure==

In response to the faltering results of the England national team, Rob Andrew was appointed on 18 August 2006 by the RFU to the post of Director of Elite Rugby, to oversee all aspects of representative rugby in England from the regional academies to the full senior side, including senior team selection powers and the power to hire and fire coaches at all levels of English rugby. Andrew also had the task of building bridges with the premiership clubs and the RFU in terms of players withdrawal from their club duties for international duties. On 6 January 2011 his role of Director of Elite Rugby was scrapped in an overhaul of the organisation&#x27;s structure.

Chief executive John Steele opted to create a single rugby department divided into the areas of performance, operations and development with the emphasis on &quot;delivering rugby at all levels&quot;, with each area having its own director.

==National teams==

===Men&#x27;s team===

The England national rugby union team competes in the annual Six Nations Championship with France, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, and Wales. They have won this championship outright on a total of 28 occasions (with the addition of 10 shared victories), 13 times winning the Grand Slam and 25 times winning the Triple Crown, making them the most successful team in the tournament&#x27;s history. England are to date the only team from the northern hemisphere to win the Rugby World Cup, when they won the tournament back in 2003. They were also runners-up in 1991, 2007 and 2019. They are currently ranked Fifth in the world by World Rugby as of 3 October 2024.

===Premiership===
Premiership Rugby is an English professional rugby union competition. The Premiership consists of ten clubs, and is the top division of the English rugby union system. Premiership clubs qualify for Europe&#x27;s two main club competitions, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the European Rugby Challenge Cup. The team finishing at the bottom of the Premiership each season was relegated to the second-division RFU Championship until 2020, and the winner of the Championship is promoted to the Premiership until 2022. The competition has been played since 1987, and has evolved into the current Premiership system. The current champions are Saracens. The most recently promoted side are Saracens.

===Championship===
The RFU Championship is the second tier of the English rugby union league system and was founded in September 1987. The league was previously known as National Division One and in 2009 changed from a league consisting of semi-professional clubs to one that was fully professional. However, since 2020 several clubs have since returned to a semi-professional model. The current champions are Jersey Reds after beating Ealing Trailfinders.

===Premiership Women&#x27;s Rugby===
Premiership Women&#x27;s Rugby is the top tier of the women&#x27;s English rugby union domestic league system run by the Rugby Football Union. The league was created mainly from teams in the Women&#x27;s Premiership. Its first season began on 16 September 2017. The current champions are Gloucester-Hartpury, with the runners up being Bristol Bears. All of the teams have connections with men&#x27;s premiership or championship clubs.

==UK neurological injuries lawsuit==
In December 2023 a group of 295 former rugby players sued World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union 
for allegedly failing to put in place reasonable measures to protect the health and safety of players. This alleged failure was said to have caused disorders such as motor neurone disease, early onset dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, epilepsy and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>The West Bačka District (, ) is one of seven administrative districts of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. It lies in the geographical region of Bačka. It has a population of 154,491 inhabitants. The administrative seat of the district is the city of Sombor.

==Administrative history==
In the 9th century, the area was ruled by the Bulgarian-Slavic duke Salan. From 11th to 16th century, during the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, the area was divided between the Bodrogiensis County, Bacsensis County, and Csongradiensis County. In 1526–1527, the area was ruled by the independent Serb ruler, emperor Jovan Nenad, while during Ottoman administration (16th-17th century), it was part of the Sanjak of Segedin.

During Habsburg administration (18th century), the area was divided between the Batsch County, Bodrog County and the Military Frontier. The two counties were joined into single Batsch-Bodrog County in the 18th century. Since the abolishment of the Theiß-Marosch section of the Military Frontier in 1751, part of that territory was also included into Batsch-Bodrog County. In the 1850s, the area was mostly part of the Sombor District, with some parts in the Novi Sad District. After 1860, the area was again included into Batsch-Bodrog County.

During the royal Serb-Croat-Slovene (Yugoslav) administration (1918–1941), the area was part of the Novi Sad County (1918–1922), Bačka Oblast (1922–1929), and Danube Banovina (1929–1941).

During the Hungarian-German Axis occupation (1941–1944), the area was included into Bács-Bodrog County. Since 1944, the area was part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina (which was part of new socialist Yugoslav Serbia since 1945). The present-day districts of Serbia (including West Bačka District) were defined by the Government of Serbia&#x27;s Enactment of 29 January 1992.

<doc id="696507" wikidata="Q648718" url="?curid=696507" title="South Bačka District">
<text>The South Bačka District (, ; ; ) is one of seven administrative districts of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. Geographically it lies in the southern part of Bačka and northern part of Syrmia. According to the 2022 census results, it has a population of 607,178 inhabitants. The administrative center of the district is the city of Novi Sad, which is also the capital and the largest city of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.

==Administrative history==

In the 9th century, the area was ruled by the Bulgarian-Slavic duke Salan. From 11th to 16th century, during the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, the area was mostly part of the Bacsensis County, with small northern parts of it in the Bodrogiensis County and Csongradiensis County. In 1526–27, the area was ruled by the independent Serb ruler, emperor Jovan Nenad, while during Ottoman administration (16th-17th century), it was part of the Sanjak of Segedin.

During Habsburg administration (18th century), the area was divided between the Bodrog County, Batsch County and the Military Frontier. The two counties were joined into single Batsch-Bodrog County in the 18th century. Since the abolishment of the Theiß-Marosch section of the Military Frontier in 1751, part of that territory was also included into Batsch-Bodrog County. The only part of the area that remained within Military Frontier was Šajkaška region. From 1751 to 1848, northeastern part of the area belonged to the autonomous District of Potisje.

In the 1850s, the area was mostly part of the Novi Sad District, with some northern parts in the Sombor District. After 1860, the area was again included into Batsch-Bodrog County (officially Bács-Bodrog County since 1867). In 1873, the Military Frontier in Šajkaška region was abolished and that area was also included into Bács-Bodrog County.

During the royal Serb-Croat-Slovene (Yugoslav) administration (1918–1941), the area was initially a part of the Novi Sad County (1918–1922). Between 1922 and 1929, it was divided between Bačka Oblast and Belgrade Oblast, while from 1929 to 1941 it was part of the Danube Banovina. During the Hungarian-German Axis occupation (1941–1944), the area was included into Bács-Bodrog County.

Since 1944, the area was part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina (which was part of new socialist Yugoslav Serbia since 1945). The present-day districts of Serbia (including South Bačka District) were defined by the Government of Serbia&#x27;s Enactment of 29 January 1992.

==Municipalities==
The district is divided into 11 municipalities in addition to City of Novi Sad, which itself is divided into two urban municipalities:
*Srbobran
*Bač
*Bečej (Hungarian: &quot;Óbecse&quot;)
*Vrbas
*Bačka Palanka
*Bački Petrovac (Slovak: &quot;Báčsky Petrovec&quot;)
*Žabalj
*Titel
*Temerin
*Beočin
*Sremski Karlovci

The city of Novi Sad is divided into the municipalities Novi Sad and Petrovaradin.

Note: for municipalities with Hungarian and Slovak relative or absolute majority names are also given in these languages.

<text>Katherine Nicole McKibbin (September 28, 1978 – November 1, 2020) was an American rock music singer-songwriter who finished third in the debut season of the reality television series &quot;American Idol&quot;. Before &quot;American Idol&quot;, McKibbin appeared in the first season of &quot;Popstars&quot;. In May 2007, she released a rock album called &quot;Unleashed&quot;.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==

In 2002, McKibbin appeared on the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, placing third. McKibbin was in the bottom three every week except one, a total of six times (including elimination).

==Post-&quot;Idol&quot; career==
Immediately following her stint on &quot;American Idol&quot;, McKibbin signed with 19 Management and RCA Records. They urged her to record a country album, but she was determined to stay true to her rock roots; she rejected the idea, saying she felt she would be &quot;selling out.&quot; The creative differences resulted in no releasable recordings being produced.

McKibbin ran Angelfire Productions, a karaoke company, but after &quot;Idol&quot;, &quot;got out of the karaoke business&quot; to focus on her music career.

In 2004, she appeared on the holiday CD &quot;Christmas in a Fishbowl&quot; with several other reality stars for Fishbowl.com.

In May 2005, McKibbin joined Dallas rock band Downside. They did several shows together including a sold-out show at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas, but McKibbin left the band in September of the same year due to creative and personal differences.

In 2005, McKibbin appeared in several reality shows, including a &quot;Reality TV Stars&quot; episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, and the sports competition show &quot;Battle of the Network Reality Stars&quot;, in which her team won. She also appeared in the E! Entertainment reality show &quot;Kill Reality&quot;, which documented the filming of &quot;The Scorned&quot;, a television movie featuring a cast of people who had been on reality television shows; McKibbin played a singer in the film.

Later in 2005, it was announced that she was signed to Australian indie label Astral Records, with her rock-influenced album originally intended to be released in February 2006. Recording began in December 2005, starting with a cover version of &quot;To Be with You&quot; by Mr. Big. A single of &quot;The Lie&quot;/&quot;To Be with You&quot; and a limited edition behind-the-scenes DVD was made available through her official website.

McKibbin&#x27;s debut album &quot;Unleashed&quot; came out May 22, 2007. For the promotional 2007 tour, McKibbin worked with Texas heavy metal band Rivethead.

Late in 2007, McKibbin recorded two Christmas songs for the album &quot;American Christmas&quot;. One was a cover of &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is You&quot; by Vince Vance &amp; the Valiants and the other was an original, &quot;Alone with the Christmas Lights&quot;.

In 2008, McKibbin appeared on the second season of the VH1 reality show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, in which she received treatment for cocaine and alcohol addiction at the Pasadena Recovery Center (PRC). While receiving a physical examination from Dr. Drew Pinsky in the season&#x27;s first episode, she revealed that she was sexually, physically and emotionally abused as a child. On top of that, she also lost her mother to addiction the previous year. Pinsky noticed signs of hepatomegaly during the examination, most likely caused by her alcoholism. She said that she was on prescription ziprasidone and dextro-methamphetamine to reduce her anxiety, but Pinsky told her that it was unwise for a serious addict to be on such powerful medications. Her withdrawal was painful, and the day after she was taken off her medications she experienced the lethargy of withdrawal syndrome.

After McKibbin completed the program at the PRC, she moved into a sober living environment, which was filmed for the &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot; spinoff &quot;Sober House&quot;. During a group night out for McKibbin and her fellow sober living housemates, which fell on the anniversary of her mother&#x27;s death the previous year, she gave her first-ever performance while sober, singing her song &quot;Inconsolable&quot;.

McKibbin later appeared in the fifth episode of &quot;Celebrity Rehab&quot;&#x27;s fifth season, during which she marked three years of sobriety, and performed for that season&#x27;s cast.

In 2011, McKibbin formed a new band called Love Stricken Demise. The band released an EP in 2012 called &quot;Psychotrip&quot; which included their single &quot;Celebrity High&quot;.

In 2014, McKibbin was seen accompanying her son Tristan on the thirteenth season of &quot;American Idol&quot; during his audition, where he made it to Hollywood, but was ultimately cut before the live shows.

McKibbin used to give vocal and performance lessons for children in Fort Worth, Texas.

==Personal life==
McKibbin was born in Grand Prairie, Texas. She was married to Craig Sadler. She had a son, Tristen Cole Langley, (b. December 20, 1997), from a previous relationship. Her husband, Craig, appeared with her on &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;.

McKibbin marked a year of sobriety on June 10, 2009.

==Death==
On November 1, 2020, McKibbin was taken off life support after suffering a brain aneurysm on October 28. She is the fourth &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist to die after Michael Johns in 2014, Rickey Smith in 2016, and Leah LaBelle in 2018.

<text>The Srem District (, ) is one of seven administrative districts of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. It lies in the geographical regions of Srem and Mačva. According to the 2022 census results, it has a population of 282,547 inhabitants. The administrative center is the city of Sremska Mitrovica.

==Name==
In Serbian, the district is known as &quot;Sremski okrug&quot; (), in Croatian as &quot;Srijemski okrug&quot;, in Hungarian as &quot;Szerémségi Körzet&quot;, in Slovak as &quot;Sriemskí okres&quot;, in Rusyn as &quot;Srimski okruh&quot; (Сримски окрух), and in Romanian as &quot;Districtul Srem&quot;.

==Administration==
The Srem District is one of seven districts (first-level administrative divisions) of Vojvodina (and 29 of Serbia). Districts are regional centers and do not have any form of self-government. The District includes the municipalities of:

* Inđija
* Irig
* Pećinci
* Ruma
* Sremska Mitrovica
* Stara Pazova
* Šid

==History==
In Late antiquity, between the 3rd and 5th centuries, the city of Sirmium (present-day Sremska Mitrovica) was a capital of the Roman province of Pannonia Secunda. In the 6th century Sirmium was the capital of Byzantine Pannonia. In the 7th century, during Avar administration, the area was ruled by Bulgar local ruler Kuber, while in the 11th century, it was ruled by independent Bulgarian-Slavic duke Sermon. In the 11th century, it was part of the Byzantine Theme of Sirmium.

During the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary (12th–16th century), the area was divided between Sirmiensis and Valkoensis counties. During Ottoman administration (16th–18th century), the area was initially a part of the vassal Ottoman duchy of Syrmia ruled by Serb duke Radoslav Čelnik and was subsequently included into the Sanjak of Syrmia.

At the end of the Austro-Russian-Turkish War of 1735–1739, there was a migration of Albanians from the Kelmendi tribe to Srem, who were recorded as speaking Albanian as late as 1921.

During Habsburg administration (18th-19th century), the area was divided between the Syrmia County and the Military Frontier. In the 1850s, northern parts of the area were part of the Novi Sad District, but were again included into Syrmia County after 1860. Since the abolishment of the Military Frontier in 1882, Syrmian parts of the Frontier were also included into Syrmia County.

During the royal Serb-Croat-Slovene (Yugoslav) administration (1918–1941), the area was part of the Syrmia County (1918–1922) and Syrmia Oblast (1922–1929). From 1929 to 1931, the area was divided between Danube Banovina in the north-east and Drina Banovina in the south-west, while from 1931 to 1939 the area was part of the Danube Banovina. From 1939 to 1941, north-western parts of the area were part of the Banovina of Croatia.

During the German-Croatian Axis occupation (1941–1944), the area was included into the Grand County of Vuka. Since 1944, the area was part of autonomous Yugoslav Vojvodina (which was part of new socialist Yugoslav Serbia since 1945). The present-day districts of Serbia (including Syrmia District) were defined by the Government of Serbia&#x27;s Enactment of 29 January 1992.

==Demographics==

According to the last official census done in 2011, the Srem District has 312,278 inhabitants.

==Culture==
The monasteries on the Fruška Gora mountain are the greatest cultural treasures of this region. There are 16 active monasteries, mostly dating back from the late middle ages, including Grgeteg Monastery, Jazak Monastery and Velika Remeta. The Krušedol Monastery is a true treasury of the Vojvodinan painting. It was founded in 1514 as an endowment of Orthodox bishop Maksim Branković and his mother Angelina. In the Novo Hopovo Monastery, the church architecture and fresco paintings are particularly attractive. The exact time of its first construction is unknown, but 1765 is known as the year of its reconstruction.

Archeological Museum Carska Palata (Royal Palace) in Sremska Mitrovica is dedicated to the remains of the Roman town Sirmium, dating back to 1st century BC.

A museum dedicated to the prominent Serbian artist Sava Šumanović is located in his hometown of Šid. It consists of the Gallery with 417 works of art, donated by Sava&#x27;s mother Persida Šumanovic, and the Memorial House, where the painter used to live with his family.

<text>The Mačva District (, ) is one of eight administrative districts of Šumadija and Western Serbia. It expands in the western parts of Serbia, in the geographical regions of Mačva, Podrinje, Posavina, and Pocerina. According to the 2011 census results, it has a population of 298,931 inhabitants. The administrative center of the Mačva district is the city of Šabac.

==History and culture==
Famous monuments can be seen in the vicinity of Šabac, dedicated to events from the history of Serbian people: the Monument to Karađorđe and Serbian Heroes of the First Serbian Uprising and the Museum of the Battle of Mišar, the remnants of the ancient cities on the banks of the Sava river: Novo Selo, the site of the King Milutin&#x27;s Palace and Kosanin grad, the medieval fortress on the Cer Mountain.

Not far away from Loznica stands the village of Tršić, the birthplace of the reformer of Serbian language and orthography, Vuk Karadžić. From Tršić, a footpath leads to the Tronoša Monastery, one of the oldest medieval endowments of the Nemanjić dynasty. This fourteenth-century monastery played an important part in the preservation of Serbian culture and tradition. Over a long period, particularly during the fourteenth century, a copying school tradition was nourished in it for its own and other monasteries&#x27; needs. This preserved the historic and cultural documents of the Serbian people.

<text>Peter Strasser (1 April 1876 – 5 August 1918) was chief commander of German Imperial Navy Zeppelins during World War I, the main force operating bombing campaigns from 1915 to 1917. He was killed when flying the German Empire&#x27;s last airship raid over the United Kingdom.

==Early career==
Strasser was born in Hanover, Germany, on 1 April 1876. At the age of 15, he joined the German Imperial Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;). After serving on board SMS &quot;Stein&quot; and SMS &quot;Moltke&quot;, he entered the Naval academy in Kiel. He quickly rose through the ranks and was promoted to Lieutenant in 1895. He served on board SMS &quot;Mars&quot;, SMS &quot;Blücher&quot;, SMS &quot;Panther&quot;, SMS &quot;Mecklenburg&quot; and SMS &quot;Westfalen&quot; from 1897 to 1902. He was an excellent gunnery officer and was placed in the German Imperial Naval Office (&quot;Reichsmarine-Amt&quot;) in charge of German shipboard and coastal artillery. In September 1913, he took command of the Naval Airship Division (&quot;Marine-Luftschiff-Abteilung&quot;). Airships were as yet an unproven technology and &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Strasser became the new naval airship chief after his predecessor, &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Friedrich Metzing, drowned in the crash of the very first naval airship, the L 1. Also the single remaining naval airship L 2 was soon lost in another fatal accident. Strasser completed theoretical studies on airships and gained practical experience piloting the civilian airship LZ 17 &quot;Sachsen&quot;. Another airship, LZ 13 &quot;Hansa&quot; was chartered to train naval crews while new ships were being built. At the start of the war Navy had only one airship operational, the LZ 24 (Navy designation L 3). L 3, under Strasser&#x27;s personal command, was the only one to participate in the Imperial Navy manoeuvres just before the war.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Navy airships were initially confined to anti-submarine, anti-mine and scouting missions. They served in the Battle of Heligoland Bight.

However, on 19–20 January 1915, L3 and L4 participated in the first bombing raids over England, attacking Great Yarmouth, Sheringham and King&#x27;s Lynn. Over the next 3 years, bombing campaigns would be launched primarily against Britain, but also on Paris and other cities and ports. Strasser would participate in the England raids at least once a month. He decided to test the newly developed spy basket himself, and almost fell out when it became entangled with the Zeppelin&#x27;s aerial. Initially, bombing was limited to military targets but with great lobbying support of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; Paul Behncke, the Kaiser approved attacks against civilian targets. Official British estimates list 498 civilians and 58 soldiers killed by air attack in Britain between 1915 and 1918. 1,913 injuries are recorded. The Imperial Navy dropped 360,000 kg of bombs, the majority on the British Isles. 307,315 kg were directed at enemy vessels, ports and towns; 58,000 kg were dropped over Italy, the Baltic and the Mediterranean. German army airships carried 160,000 kg of bombs to their designated targets: 44,000 kg hit Belgium and France, 36,000 kg England, and 80,000 kg Russia and south eastern Europe. However, questions remain over whether airships (and more importantly, their irreplaceable crews) would have been better used as a purely naval weapon.

&quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; Reinhard Scheer became Strasser&#x27;s superior in January 1916, and tried unsuccessfully to tame Strasser&#x27;s aggressive pursuit of independence. On 28 November, 1916, Strasser was appointed by imperial decree as &quot;Leader of Airships&quot; (&quot;Führer der Luftschiffe&quot;; &quot;F.d.L.&quot;).

==Death in the last raid over Great Britain==
Strasser did not live to see the end of the war. On 5 August 1918, during a night raid against Boston, Norwich, and the Humber Estuary, Strasser&#x27;s L 70 met a British reconnaissance D.H.4. Pilot Major Egbert Cadbury and Gunner Major Robert Leckie shot down the L 70 just north of Wells-next-the-Sea on the Norfolk coast. None of the 23 men aboard survived. It proved to be the last airship raid over Great Britain.

==Legacy==
Strasser&#x27;s impact on both the war and history was important for the future of air warfare. He was instrumental in the development of long range bombing and the development of the rigid airship as an efficient, high altitude, all-weather aircraft. He was a major proponent of the doctrine of bombing attacks on civilian as well as military targets, to serve both as propaganda and as a means of diverting resources from the front line.

<text>Sir Joshua Jebb, (8 May 1793 – 26 June 1863) was a British officer of the Royal Engineers who participated in the Battle of Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain during the War of 1812, He became Surveyor-General of convict prisons. By 1850, Pentonville Prison which he had designed had become a template for prison construction across the British Empire. Michael Ignatieff described Pentonville as &quot;the culmination of a history of efforts to devise a perfectly rational and reformative mode of imprisonment&quot;.

Jebb was also involved in designing Woking Convict Invalid Prison, Broadmoor Hospital, a secure mental hospital in Crowthorne in Berkshire, and Mountjoy Prison in the centre of Dublin.

==Early life==
He was born at Chesterfield on 8 May 1793, the eldest son of Joshua Jebb of Walton Hall, Derbyshire and his wife Dorothy, daughter of General Henry Gladwin of Stubbing Court. His father, a grand-nephew of Samuel Jebb and John Jebb (Dean of Cashel), belonged to a family who produced a number of distinguished descendants, and had once had property in England and the West Indies, but he largely lost his wealth. His sister Frances married William Miles (1797–1844), a shipowner and West India merchant, and bought the estate of Firbeck Hall which was later inherited by his descendants.

After passing through the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, Jebb was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 1 July 1812. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 21 July 1813, and embarked for Canada in the following October.

Jebb served with the army under the command of General Francis de Rottenburg on the frontier of Lower Canada until the summer of 1814, when he joined the army of Lieutenant-general Sir George Prevost in the United States, and took part in the campaign of the autumn of 1814. He was present at the Battle of Plattsburgh, 11 September 1814, and was thanked in general orders.

In 1816, Jebb completed a survey for a canal which was designed to allow access to the Canadian heartland. His route, however, was not followed by Colonel By in building the Rideau Canal; he had chosen a way between Ottawa River and Kingston where Lake Ontario flows into Saint Lawrence River.
Jebb returned to England in 1820, after an extended service in Canada. He was stationed at Woolwich and afterwards at Hull until December 1827, when he embarked for the West Indies. He was promoted second captain on 26 February 1828, and was invalided home in September 1829. Having recovered his health he was sent to Chatham. Jebb was appointed adjutant of the royal sappers and miners at Chatham on 11 February 1831, and promoted first captain on 10 January 1837.

On 10 March 1838 Jebb was appointed by the Lord President of the council to hold inquiries on the grants of charters of incorporation to Bolton and Sheffield, and on 21 May of the same year he was made a member of the commission on the municipal boundary of Birmingham. 
On 23 November 1841 he received a brevet majority for his past services.

==Prisons==
Jebb was appointed Surveyor-General of prisons, a technical adviser to the Home Office, and was employed in designing county and borough prisons. He associated with the inspectors William Crawford (1788–1847) and the Rev. William Whitworth Russell, in the design and construction of the &quot;Model Prison&quot; at Pentonville. Jebb continued in his military duties, and was quartered at Birmingham until he was seconded on 20 September 1839. The penal system was then in transition. In 1837 inquiries conducted in America by Crawford had led to the adoption in principle of the &quot;separate system&quot; of prison discipline. The decline of penal transportation meant the Government was turning to an alternative method of punishing criminals.

Beginning with a period of strict separation at Pentonville, the convicts were then to be passed to a prison constructed with a view to their employment on public works. For this purpose Jebb designed the prison at Portland. Similar prisons were subsequently erected at Dartmoor, Chatham, Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. In 1843–4 Jebb erected a terrace of houses, part of Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight: Nicholson Street, now listed buildings. On 29 June 1843 he was made a commissioner for the government of Pentonville Prison.

In 1844, Jebb was appointed a member of a royal commission to report on the punishment of military crime by imprisonment. The commission recommended the establishment of prisons for the exclusive reception of military prisoners, and under the supervision of an officer to be termed inspector-general of military prisons, who should also supervise provost and regimental cells. Jebb was appointed to this office on 27 December 1844 in addition to his other duties. Subsequently it was held by the officer at the head of civil prisons, at this period a post held by an officer of the Royal Engineers.

Jebb was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 16 April 1847. On 1 May 1849 his appointment as commissioner of Pentonville prison was renewed. In 1850, a board, called the Directors of Convict Prisons, was formed to replace the various bodies which had previously managed the different convict prisons. Jebb was appointed chairman of the board, and under his direction the new system was adopted and developed.

==Later life==
Jebb retired from the army, leaving military service on full pay retirement on 1 January 1850; his successor as Survey General of Prisons was Major Edmund Henderson. He subsequently received the honorary rank of colonel on 28 November 1854. He was made a KCB for his civil services on 25 March 1859. In 1861 and 1862 he served on commissions appointed to consider the construction of embankments of the River Thames, and of communications between the embankment at Blackfriars Bridge and the Mansion House, and between Westminster Bridge and Millbank.

Jebb died suddenly on 26 June 1863 in Charing Cross, London, coming off the omnibus from Parson&#x27;s Green, where he resided, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery. 
==Major works==
Jebb&#x27;s works included:

* &quot;A Practical Treatise on Strengthening and Defending Outposts, Villages, Houses, Bridges,&quot; Chatham, 1836.
* &quot;Modern Prisons : their Construction and Ventilation,&quot; with plates, London, 1844.

* &quot;Reports and Observations on the Discipline and Management of Convict Prisons,&quot; edited by the Earl of Chichester, London, 1863.

==Family==
Jebb married twice; firstly, on 14 June 1830 Mary Legh Thomas, daughter of William Burtinshaw Thomas, of Highfield, Derbyshire, who died in 1850. They had a son and three daughters. The children were:

* Captain Joshua Gladwyn Jebb of Barnby Moor House, born 1839. He was father of Captain Sydney Gladwyn Jebb JP, of Firbeck Hall, and grandfather of Gladwyn Jebb of the United Nations.
* Mary Dorothy, married 1854 the cleric Henry Ellison.
* Emily Sarah, married 1860 Basil Charles Boothby of the 95th Regiment.
* Frances Beatrice, married the cleric William Edmund Batty, and was mother of De Witt Batty.

Jebb married, secondly on 5 September 1854, Lady Amelia Rose Pelham, daughter of Thomas Pelham, the Earl of Chichester, who survived him.

<text>Oecophoridae (concealer moths) is a family of small moths in the superfamily Gelechioidea. The phylogeny and systematics of gelechoid moths are still not fully resolved, and the circumscription of the Oecophoridae is strongly affected by this.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
* Pleurotinae 
* Deuterogoniinae 
* Unplaced
** &quot;Colchia&quot; 

Also possibly included is the Peruvian species &quot;Auxotricha ochrogypsa&quot;, described by Edward Meyrick in 1931 as the sole member of its genus. In the past, the family was circumscribed more widely and included the following subfamilies:
* Amphisbatinae (sometimes in Depressariinae)
* Autostichinae
* Depressariinae (including Cryptolechiinae)
* Hypertrophinae
* Metachandinae
* Oecophorinae (including Chimabachinae, Deuterogoniinae, Peleopodinae, Philobotinae)
* Stathmopodinae
* Stenomatinae
Some treatments include only the Oecophorinae and Stathmopodinae here, placing the others elsewhere in the Gelechoidea (typically in the Elachistidae, but occasionally as independent families). But this approach might make Elachistidae highly paraphyletic. Other authors go as far as to expand the Oecophoridae beyond the delimitation used here, including also such groups as the Ethmiidae and Xyloryctidae. The latter may indeed be part of a monophyletic Oecophoridae, but more research is required; the Ethmiidae on the other hand are more likely a distinct family. The mysterious genus &quot;Aeolanthes&quot; is also sometimes included in the Oecophoridae (as a monotypic subfamily Aeolanthinae), but its actual relationships are quite obscure.

Some additional genera are also treated as Oecophoridae &quot;incertae sedis&quot; in recent studies:
* &quot;Amseloecia&quot; 
* &quot;Callimodes&quot; (Oecophorinae?)
** subgenus &quot;Orienta&quot; 
* &quot;Colchia&quot; 
* &quot;Luquetia&quot; (Depressariinae?)

* &quot;Minetia&quot; (Oecophorinae?)
* &quot;Odonna&quot; 
* &quot;Schiffermuellerina&quot; (Oecophorinae?)
** &quot;Schiffermuellerina grandis&quot; 
* &quot;Zizyphia&quot; (Oecophorinae? Formerly in Gelechiidae)
* †&quot;Epiborkhausenites&quot; (Bartonian age, Baltic amber, Lithuania)

==Relationship with humans==
Many concealer moths feed on dead plant material and are nutrient recyclers. On the other hand, the family includes the white-shouldered house moth (&quot;Endrosis sarcitrella&quot;), which is a widely distributed moth that has caterpillars that infest stored grain, and the brown house moth (&quot;Hofmannophila pseudospretella&quot;), which feeds on textiles and carpets as well as stored foodstuffs.

Concealer moths have also been put to useful service. &quot;Agonopterix ulicetella&quot;, a native of Europe, has been introduced to New Zealand and Hawaii in an attempt to control the European gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;), and the defoliating hemlock moth (&quot;Agonopterix alstroemeriana&quot;) has been used against &quot;Conium maculatum&quot; poison hemlock in the United States.

==History and culture==
Smederevo was the capital of the Serb State in the fourteenth century - there stood the royal palace at the time of the then Serbian ruler Đurađ Branković. Today, in the remnants of the Smederevo fortress, finished in 1430, traces of the former palace, chapel, and the house of the royal family can be discerned. At the old city cemetery stands a church from the fourteenth century, assumed to have been the family vault of the Serb ruler Đurađ Branković, which gave rise to numerous legends.

This area is also well known as the place of the Karađorđe&#x27;s assassination after The First Serbian Uprising around the Pokajnica monastery near Velika Plana.

<doc id="696542" wikidata="Q2992614" url="?curid=696542" title="The Religion of China">
<text>The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism is a book written by Max Weber, a German economist and sociologist. It was first published in German under the title Konfuzianismus und Taoismus in 1915 and an adapted version appeared in 1920. An English translation was published in 1951 and several editions have been released since.

It was his second major work on the sociology of religion, after &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Europe and Puritanism, and posed a question why capitalism did not develop in China. His analysis was driven by a comparative approach, seeking to understand the unique cultural and institutional factors that shaped China&#x27;s historical development. From the chronological perspective, he concentrated on early period of Chinese history (Hundred Schools of Thought, Warring States period), during which major Chinese schools of thoughts (Confucianism, Taoism) were invented. These schools of thought not only shaped Chinese intellectual life but also influenced the social and political structures of the time. In that period, he focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom, and Chinese religion, as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.

Weber&#x27;s choice of topics and analysis inspired further attention and critique. His work has been praised for its ambitious scope and theoretical rigor, but it has also faced criticism for its reliance on Western frameworks to interpret non-Western societies. The sociologist of Chinese religion C.K. Yang, for instance, wrote that Weber&#x27;s interpretation is &quot;largely the result of viewing the religious situation in Chinese culture from the view of the Christian world, where religion has a formal organizational system and has occupied a prominent structural position in the organizational scheme of Western society.&quot; This critique underscores the challenges of cross-cultural analysis and the importance of contextualizing religious and social phenomena within their specific cultural settings.

==Historical background==
Weber based much of his analysis on the early period of Chinese history. By 200 B.C., the Chinese state had emerged from a loose federation of feudal states of the Warring States period to the unified empire with patrimonal rule. Confucianism emerged to dominate the other schools that had developed in the fertile social upheavals of pre-imperial China such as Daoism (Taoism), Mohism, and Legalism, all of which had criticised Confucianism (c. 400 – c. 200 B.C.). This period, known as the &#x27;Hundred Schools of Thought,&#x27; was a time of intense intellectual ferment, with philosophers debating the nature of governance, ethics, and human nature. One of Confucius&#x27;s disciples, Mencius, (c. 372 – c. 289 B.C.) developed a more idealistic version of Confucianism, while Xunzi (Hsün Tzu, c. 313 – c. 238 B.C.) argued that all inclinations are shaped by acquired language and other social forms. Mencius emphasized the innate goodness of human nature, while Xunzi took a more pragmatic view, asserting that human nature is inherently selfish and must be shaped through education and ritual.

Confucianism rose to the position of an official orthodoxy during the Han dynasty (206 B.C. – A.D. 220). The Han dynasty&#x27;s adoption of Confucianism as state ideology marked a turning point in Chinese history, as it integrated Confucian principles into the legal and administrative systems, shaping the governance of imperial China for centuries to come.

When the Han disintegrated, Confucianism fell with it and lay dormant for almost 400 years (A.D. 220–618) as Chinese Buddhism and Taoism offered new visions. During this period, Buddhism, which had entered China from India, gained widespread popularity, offering spiritual solace and a new worldview that complemented traditional Chinese thought. China was again unified, by the Sui dynasty (581-618) and by the Tang dynasty (618–906). The Tang dynasty, in particular, is often regarded as a golden age of Chinese culture, marked by cosmopolitanism and the flourishing of arts, literature, and religion. During the Song (Sung) dynasty (960–1279), Neo-Confucianism emerged as a dominant intellectual force, synthesizing Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist ideas into a cohesive philosophical system.- interpreting classical Confucian doctrine in a way that addressed Buddhist and Daoist issues. Thinkers like Zhu Xi (1130–1200) played a pivotal role in this transformation, emphasizing the importance of moral self-cultivation and the investigation of things (gewu). In the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Wang Yangming claimed that the mind projects &quot;li&quot; (principle) onto things rather than just noticing external &quot;li&quot;. Wang&#x27;s philosophy, known as the &#x27;School of Mind,&#x27; challenged traditional Neo-Confucian thought by asserting that knowledge and morality are rooted in the innate faculties of the mind. In the early 20th-century Chinese intellectuals blamed Confucianism for the scientific and political backwardness of China after the disastrous conflicts with Western military technology at the dawn of the modern era. This critique was part of a broader movement, known as the May Fourth Movement (1919), which called for the rejection of traditional values and the adoption of Western science and democracy as a means of modernizing China.

==Cities==
Similar to Europe, Chinese cities were founded as forts or leader&#x27;s residences and were the centers of trade and crafts. These cities often served as administrative hubs, where imperial officials governed surrounding regions and collected taxes, further centralizing state control. However, they never received political autonomy and in fact sometimes had fewer rights than villages. This lack of autonomy was a deliberate feature of the imperial system, designed to prevent the rise of powerful urban elites who could challenge the central authority. Likewise, its citizens had no special political rights or privileges; the resident of Chinese cities never constituted a separate status class like the residents of European cities. In contrast to European burghers, who often formed a distinct social class with political influence, Chinese urban dwellers remained subordinate to the imperial bureaucracy.

The lack of city development is partially due to strengths of kinship ties, which stems from religious beliefs (in ancestral spirits) and maintaining strong ties to the villages in which one&#x27;s ancestors lived. The guilds likewise competed against each other for the favour of the Emperor, never uniting in order to fight for more rights.

==Patrimonialism, officialdom and literati==
Unlike eternally divided Europe, China saw early unification and establishment of imperial government with a centralized officialdom. This unification, achieved under the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), laid the foundation for a bureaucratic system that would endure for over two millennia, shaping the political and social fabric of Chinese civilization. Relatively peaceful centuries in the first centuries of Chinese history meant that military never gained significant authority when the power structure was being formed. The absence of prolonged military conflict allowed the imperial state to prioritize civil administration over military governance, creating a unique political culture centered on meritocratic bureaucracy. This meant that the focus of struggle for political power turned from the distribution of land to the distribution of offices, which with their fees and taxes were the most prominent source of income for the holder. The imperial examination system, established during the Sui and Tang dynasties, further institutionalized this shift by selecting officials based on Confucian scholarship rather than aristocratic lineage or military prowess. The state depended on the services of those freely removable and non-hereditary officials, rather than on the service of military (knights), like in Europe. This reliance on a professional bureaucracy ensured that power remained concentrated in the hands of the emperor, who could appoint and dismiss officials at will, thereby preventing the rise of a feudal aristocracy. The officialdom nonetheless had significant powers, and its vested interests were in preserving the &quot;status quo&quot;, opposing any reforms or changes, particularly on a governmental level.

For the members of the officialdom, it was their rank, or status, which was of prime importance. The &#x27;superior&#x27; man (literati) should stay away from the pursuit of wealth (though not from the wealth itself). Therefore, becoming a civil servant was preferred to becoming a businessman and granted a much higher status class. Literati did not care about the wealth, although they could and did care about their status. As Weber wrote:

==Religious organization and the Confucian orthodoxy==
Chinese civilization had no religious prophecy nor a powerful priesthood social class. This absence of a centralized religious hierarchy allowed for a more flexible and pluralistic religious landscape, where local cults and traditions coexisted without the need for doctrinal uniformity. The emperor was the high priest of the state religion and the supreme ruler. Weber emphasized that Confucianism tolerated the simultaneous existence of many popular cults and made no effort to organize them as part of a religious doctrine, while nonetheless curtailing the political ambitions of their priests. Instead it taught adjustment to the world. Confucianism emphasized the importance of fulfilling one&#x27;s role within the family, society, and state, promoting a worldview centered on human relationships and moral duty rather than transcendental salvation.

This forms a sharp contrast with medieval Europe, where the Church was often able to superimpose its will over those of secular rulers, and where the same, singular religion was the religion of rulers, nobility and the common folk. In Europe, the Catholic Church wielded significant political and spiritual authority, often challenging the power of kings and emperors, while in China, religious authority was subordinated to the imperial state. The Chinese model of governance, with its integration of religious and political authority under the emperor, created a system where religion served the state rather than competing with it.

==State cult and popular religiosity==
According to Confucianism, the worship of great deities was the affair of the state, ancestral worship is required of all, and a multitude of popular cults are tolerable. This hierarchical approach to religion reflected Confucianism&#x27;s emphasis on social order and the proper performance of rituals, which were seen as essential for maintaining harmony between the human and cosmic realms. Confucianism tolerated magic and mysticism as long as they were useful tools for controlling the masses; it denounced them as heresy and suppressed them when they threatened the established order (hence the opposition to Buddhism). Another notable quality was the avoidance of both irrational ecstasy and excitement, as well as mystic contemplation and metaphysical speculation.

Note that in this context Confucianism can be referred to as the state cult, and Taoism as the popular religion.

==Social structure and the capitalist economy==
Weber argued that, while several factors were good for development of a capitalist economy (long periods of peace, improved control of rivers, population growth, freedom to acquire land and move outside of native community, freedom of choosing the occupation), they were outweighed by others (mostly stemming from religion) in China:
* technical inventions were opposed on the basis of religion (disturbance of ancestral spirits leading to bad luck), instead of changing the world, adjusting oneself to it was preferred This emphasis on harmony with the natural and spiritual world, rooted in Confucian and Daoist thought, discouraged the kind of technological innovation that drove industrialization in the West. 
* sale of land was often prohibited or made very difficult
* extended kinship groups (based on religion stressing the importance of family ties and ancestry) protected its members against economic adversities, therefore negatively affecting one&#x27;s motivation for payment of debts and work discipline
* those kinship prevented the development of urban status class, hindered legal developments like creation of legal institutions, codification of laws and a jurist status class.

==Confucianism and Puritanism==
According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of rational thought, each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma. Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint, and did not oppose accumulation of wealth.

However, to both those qualities where just means to the final goal, and here they were divided by a key difference. The Confucianism goal was &quot;a cultured status position&quot;, while Puritanism&#x27;s goal was to create individuals who are &quot;tools of God&quot;. Confucianism emphasized the cultivation of moral virtue and social harmony, aiming to produce a refined gentleman (junzi) who embodied ethical ideals, whereas Puritanism focused on individual salvation and the glorification of God through disciplined labor and economic success. The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism. Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian. Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.

==Influence and evaluations==
The sociologist Andreas Buss wrote in 1985 that many Western scholars felt the so-called &quot;Weber-thesis&quot; belonged to a &quot;bygone era&quot; yet it continued to inspire discussion and reference. He cautioned that English language scholars would find it difficult to read Weber. One problem is that Weber did not intend the essays on China and India to be read separately or as definitive treatments. His purpose was to sketch selected elements in Indian or Chinese culture to contrast with and test his essay &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Rise of Capitalism.&quot; The essay on Confucianism and Taoism was published in English under the &quot;misleading&quot; title, &quot;The Religion of China&quot;, a title which does &quot;not at all reflect Weber’s intentions&quot;. The title suggests a comprehensive study of Chinese religion, whereas Weber&#x27;s work focused on specific aspects of Confucianism and Taoism in relation to economic ethics. In addition, Buss continued, the translations are of &quot;poor quality&quot;, even a &quot;disgrace&quot;, and add to the misunderstanding that Weber over-generalized.

<text>The Skeleton Army was a diffuse group from Weston-super-Mare, active particularly in Southern England, that opposed and disrupted The Salvation Army&#x27;s marches against alcohol in the late 19th century and best known for an attack in Bethnal Green in London. Clashes between the two groups led to the deaths of several Salvationists and injuries to many others.

==Origins==
The earliest reference to an organised opposition to The Salvation Army was in August 1880 in Whitechapel, when The Unconverted Salvation Army was founded with its flag and motto of &quot;Be just and fear not&quot;.

In 1881, Skeleton Armies were raised in Whitechapel, Exeter and Weston-super-Mare, and the name was quickly taken up elsewhere as other groups were formed in the south of England; there are no records of Skeleton Armies north of London. Membership was predominantly lower to middle working-class.

In &#x27;Blood on the Flag&#x27;, Major Nigel Bovey identifies 21 towns and cities that are north of London -- three in Scotland -- in which the Skeleton Army opposed The Salvation Army.

The &quot;Skeletons&quot; recognised each other by various insignia used to distinguish themselves. Skeletons used banners with skulls and crossbones; sometimes there were two coffins and a statement like, &quot;Blood and Thunder&quot; (mocking the Salvation Army&#x27;s war cry &quot;Blood and Fire&quot;) or the three Bs: &quot;Beef&quot;, &quot;Beer&quot; and &quot;Bacca&quot; – again mocking the Salvation Army&#x27;s three S&#x27;s – &quot;Soup&quot;, &quot;Soap&quot; and &quot;Salvation&quot;. Banners also had pictures of monkeys, rats and the devil. Skeletons further published so-called &quot;gazettes&quot; considered libellous as well as obscene and blasphemous.

Several techniques were employed by the &quot;Skeletons&quot; to disrupt Salvation Army meetings and marches; these included throwing rocks and dead rats, marching while loudly playing musical instruments or shouting, and physically assaulting Salvation Army members at their meetings.

==Confrontation==
Although George Scott Railton, second in command of the Salvation Army, claimed the Skeleton Army first started in Weston-super-Mare in 1881, contemporary press reports show that it first appeared in Exeter in October 1881. In Weston-super-Mare, in March 1882 Captain William Beatty, Thomas Bowden and William Mullins were given a three-month prison sentence by the magistrates for a breach of the peace when they broke a local ban on processions.

This led to the case of &quot;Beatty v Gillbanks&quot; (1882), which held that the Salvation Army was acting lawfully when marching, despite knowing that their assembly could well lead to riots. As their intentions were ultimately peaceful and unrelated to the cause of inciting riot, the court found their actions to be within the limits of the law. That it was known that their marching may cause riots was not found to be a breach of the law, as it was the actions of antagonistic parties including the Skeleton Army which led directly to the riotous behaviour. The convictions against Beatty and the two other Salvationists were later quashed by the High Court and costs were awarded against the sentencing magistrates.
The action was reported by &quot;The Times&quot;; at the appeal hearing it was erroneously stated that the Skeleton Army was founded in Weston-super-Mare.

Of an attack in Bethnal Green in November 1882 the &quot;Bethnal Green Eastern Post&quot; stated:

A genuine rabble of &#x27;roughs&#x27; pure and unadulterated has been infesting the district for several weeks past. These vagabonds style themselves the &#x27;Skeleton Army&#x27;... The &#x27;skeletons&#x27; have their collectors and their collecting sheets and one of them was thrust into my hands... it contained a number shopkeepers&#x27; names... I found that publicans, beer sellers and butchers are subscribing to this imposture... the collector told me that the object of the Skeleton Army was to put down the Salvationists by following them about everywhere, by beating a drum and burlesquing their songs, to render the conduct of their processions and services impossible... Amongst the Skeleton rabble there is a large percentage of the most consummate loafers and unmitigated London can produce...worthy of the disreputable class of publicans who hate the London School Board, education and and who, seeing the beginning of the end of their immoral traffic, and prepared for the most desperate enterprise.

Both sources agree Salvationists were pelted with missiles. At Bethnal Green, such items as flour, rotten eggs, stones and brickbats were among those used, and many Salvationists were manhandled and beaten. When news of trouble in London spread, Skeleton riots took place in other parts of Britain.

For example, when in April 1884 the owner of an alcohol shop in Worthing objected to Salvation Army criticism concerning the selling of alcoholic beverages, 4,000 &quot;Skeletons&quot; joined in that town in direct opposition to the Salvationists. Black, sticky tar was painted onto the wall of the alley which the entrance to the Salvation Army barracks shared with the alcohol shop. This damaged Salvation Army uniforms as they marched through it. Also eggs filled with blue paint were thrown at the &quot;Sally Army&quot;. Many in Worthing approved of these confrontational activities, but the Salvation Army continued unabated.

Captain Ada Smith led those who faced the &quot;Skeletons&quot; in Worthing. General Booth requested police protection for the Salvation Army in that town and ordered Captain Smith and her soldiers to remain in their barracks until they got it. However, the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt, said it was outside his jurisdiction to offer such protection. Finally General Booth ordered Captain Smith and her group to march on Sundays unprotected by the authorities.

On Sunday, 17 August 1884, the police, the Salvation Army and the Skeletons confronted each other in Worthing. For an hour the police kept the peace, then the Skeletons rioted. The area was filled with screaming men, brick dust and broken glass. The Salvationists returned to their &quot;barracks&quot; and the Skeletons tried to burn it down. The landlord of the barracks, George Head, a Salvation Army supporter, defended his property and the people there with a revolver, wounding several Skeletons. Head was later brought before the magistrates on a charge of feloniously and maliciously wounding a young man named Olliver.

The Metropolitan Police were at first unhelpful. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Edmund Henderson denied what happened. The public eventually demanded action and Skeleton riots in London were belatedly put down.

==Final stages==
Skeleton riots continued elsewhere until 1893 when they faded out. In 1889, at least 669 Salvation Army members were assaulted, including 251 women. On one occasion, while defending themselves, 86 Salvation Army members were arrested and imprisoned on disorderly conduct charges. When a new Salvation Army Corps was opened in Potton in Bedfordshire on 1 June 1890, large contingents of the Skeleton Army made fun of the local Salvationists. &quot;The War Cry&quot; reported:

... the skeletons did all the shouting and we had only the opportunity of blessing them by showing unruffled love in answer to the disturbance in our proceedings&quot;...&quot;The skeleton flag was out with its coffin, skull and cross-bones as well as the whole Skeleton force, uniformed, beating a drum, playing flutes, whirling rattles and screaming through trumpets. One of their chosen leaders was carried shoulder high, ringing a bell and attired in an untrimmed coal-scuttle bonnet. I noticed that the publicans looked pleased to see this array and several waved their hats. But we were good friends of the skeletons, twelve of whom sat at our tea table... Their leaders were very courteous and sincerely desirous of keeping their somewhat rabble followers within bounds. Almost implicit obedience was given them. Their skeleton War Cry was freely sold, but doesn&#x27;t quite beat the original.

In &#x27;Blood on the Flag&#x27;, Major Nigel Bovey states that there is no contemporary evidence for a Salvationist being killed directly by a member of the Skeleton Army. He records that Captain Sarah Jane Broadhurst was hit during an attack by the Skeletons in Shoreham on Sunday 12 October 1884. The captain died on 6 February 1892, some eight years later.

The mayor of Eastbourne stated he would, &quot;put down this Salvation Army business&quot; with help from the Skeleton Army if necessary. Skeletons attacked many Salvationists. Salvationists considered it incompatible with Christian principles to defend themselves but thought the police should protect them.

== Skeleton to Salvationist ==

Charles Jeffries was a &#x27;lieutenant&#x27; in the Skeleton Army in Whitechapel in 1881, and was well known for disrupting Salvation Army public meetings and on occasion had assaulted Salvation Army Soldiers and Officers. Then Jeffries was proselytised and started to attend a Salvation Army corps, soon becoming an active Soldier, and then after attending training college, became an Officer. He served in many countries including China and Australia and eventually rose to the rank of Commissioner, serving as the head of corps work as British Commissioner in the 1930s.
A two-person off-Broadway musical created by Neil Leduke was written in 2019 by John Copeland and Len Ballantine about Charles Jeffries&#x27; dramatic transformation.

<doc id="696558" wikidata="Q579468" url="?curid=696558" title="Antioch of Pisidia">
<text>Antioch in Pisidia – alternatively Antiochia in Pisidia or Pisidian Antioch () and in Roman Empire, Latin: &quot;Antiochia Caesareia&quot; or &quot;Antiochia Colonia Caesarea&quot; – was a city in the Turkish Lakes Region, which was at the crossroads of the Mediterranean, Aegean and Central Anatolian regions, and formerly on the border of Pisidia and Phrygia, hence also known as Antiochia in Phrygia. The site lies approximately 1 km northeast of Yalvaç, a modern town in Isparta Province. The city was on a hill with its highest point of 1236 m in the north.

==Geography==
The city is surrounded by, on the east the deep ravine of the Anthius River which flows into Lake Eğirdir, with the Sultan Mountains to the northeast, Mount Karakuş to the north, Kızıldağ (Red Mountain) to the southeast, Kirişli Mountain and the northern shore of Lake Eğirdir to the southwest.

Although very close to the Mediterranean on a map, the warm climate of the south cannot pass the height of the Taurus Mountains. Owing to the climate, there is no timberland but crop plants grow in areas provided with water from the Sultan Mountains, whose annual average rainfall is c. 1000 mm on the peaks and 500 mm on the slopes. This water feeds the plateau and Antioch. The other Pisidian cities Neapolis, Tyriacum, Laodiceia Katakekaumene and Philomelium founded on the slopes, benefited from this fertility.

The acropolis has an area of 460,000 m2 (115 acres) and is surrounded by fortified defence walls. The Territorium of the settlement can be seen from the Temple of Men in the sanctuary of Men Askaenos on a hill to the southeast. The Territorium of the city is estimated to have been approximately 1,400 km2 in ancient times. According to the 1950 census, there were 40 villages with 50,000 people living in the area. The population during the Roman period must have been a little more than this.

The constantly irrigated fertile soil of the land is very suitable for growing fruits and for husbandry. For the veterans (retired Roman legionaries) who came from poorer parts of Italy during the Roman period, agriculture must have been the driving force for integration of the colonies into the area.
The modern town of Yalvaç is the second biggest in Isparta province with an area of 14,000 km2 The population in the centre is 35,000, the total is c. 100,000. The town is 230 km from Antalya, 180 km from Konya, 105 km from Isparta and 50 km from Akşehir, via the main road.

==History of Antioch==

===Prehistory===
According to tradition the city dates back to the 3rd century BCE, founded by the Seleucid Dynasty, one of the Hellenistic kingdoms. But the history of the city cannot be separated from the history of the Lakes Region and of Pisidia. Research done in the area has shown habitation since the Paleolithic age.

Excavations and surveys made by D.M. Robinson and the University of Michigan around Yalvaç in 1924 uncovered artifacts from surrounding mounds that date back to the 3rd millennium BC.

In Antioch itself, no finds have emerged from the Proto-Hittite, Hittite, Phrygian or Lydian civilisations, but we know from Hittite records that the region was named &quot;Arzawa&quot; and that independent communities flourished in the region. These people did not come under the yoke of the Hittites, but fought beside them against the Egyptians in the Battle of Kadesh.

Over the ages, people were able to live independently in the Pisidian region because of its strategic position. Even the Persians, who conquered Anatolia in the 6th century BC and attempted to rule the area by dividing it into satrapies, were unable to cope with constant uprisings and turmoil.

The approach of some researchers who would like to connect the cult of Men Askaenos with the cult of the Phrygian Mother Goddess Cybele is controversial. The worship of Cybele, traces of which can be seen in Antioch, is not a result of Phrygian influence: the idea of a Mother Goddess dates back to the Neolithic age as is shown by idols and figurines exhibited in Yalvaç Museum.

===Hellenistic age===

After the death of Alexander the Great, Seleucus I Nicator, founder of the Seleucid Dynasty, took control of Pisidia. Captured places were Hellenised and, in order to protect the population, fortified cities were founded at strategically important places, usually on an acropolis. Seleucus I Nicator founded nearly 60 cities and gave to 16 of them the name of his father Antiochus. Colonists were brought from Magnesia on the Maeander to people the city of Pisidian Antioch (the Land of Antiochus).

Meanwhile, fights for the sharing of Anatolia continued, complicated by the arrival of Galatians from Europe. The self-interested Hellenistic dynasties could not expel the Galatians from the interior, but Antiochus I Soter fought against them in 270 BC in the Taurus Mountains and defeated them by the help of elephants, which the Galatians had never seen before. The historian Lucian reported the comment of Antiochos: &quot;It&#x27;s a great shame that we owe our liberation to 16 elephants&quot;. Anyway, Antiochos celebrated his victory when he returned to Syria and was given the title of &quot;Soter&quot; (Saviour).

The most reasonable approach is that Antioch was founded by Antiochus I Soter as a military base to control the Galatian attacks, because it was on the border of the regions of Pisidia and Phrygia. The foundation of Antioch indicates a date of the last quarter of the 3rd century BC, but archeological finds at the Sanctuary of Men Askaenos in the northeast date back to the 4th century BC. This indicates that there had been earlier classical cultures in the area.

===Roman period===
While the Hellenistic Kingdoms (the inheritors of Alexander the Great) were fighting each other and the Galatians, Rome became the most powerful state in Europe and started to follow a policy of expansion to the east. The Romans invaded Macedon, Thrace, and the Dardanelles, reaching Phrygia via Magnesia and Pisidia. They cowed the Galatians and according to the treaty, signed in 188 BC in Apamea, after they got the land of Pisidia from Antiochos III, they gave it to their ally, the Kingdom of Pergamon, the dominant power in the region. Attalos III, the last king of Pergamon, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome on his death in 133 BC. When Aristonikos, a usurper who claimed the throne of Pergamon shortly after, was defeated in 129 BC, Rome annexed and populated Western Anatolia with its well-developed, creative culture, lasting for centuries.

Although Anatolia was dominated by the Roman Empire as the province of Asia, Pisidia was given to the Kingdom of Cappadocia, which was an ally of Rome. During the ensuing years, the authority gap remained in these kingdoms so remote from central control, which led to the rise of powerful pirate kingdoms, especially in Cilicia and Pisidia. The Romans were disturbed by these kingdoms and fought against them. By 102 BC, Cilicia, Pamphylia, Phrygia and Pisida had been freed from pirates and Roman rule was restored.

The geographical and strategic position of the region made it difficult to control the area and maintain constant peace. The Homonadesians settled in the Taurus Mountains between Attaleia and Ikonion, which caused problems for Rome. Marcus Antonius, who had to control the roads connecting Pisidia to Pamphylia, charged his allied king Amyntas, King of Pisidia, to fight against Homonadesians, but Amyntas was killed during the struggle.

That is when Rome started to colonize using retired legionaries as a solution to the failure of the locally appointed governors. The province of Galatia was established in 25 BC, and Antioch became a part of it. To support the struggle against the Homonadesians logistically, the construction of a road called the Via Sebaste, the centre of which was Antioch, was started by the governor of the Province of Galatia, Cornutus Arrutius Aquila. The Via Sebaste was separated into two and directed to the southwest and southeast to surround the Homonadesians. Secondary connecting roads were built between these two roads. Rome by means of the Via Sebaste Publius Sulpicius Quirinius brought an end to the Homonadesians problem in 3 BC, relocating survivors in different surrounding locations.

During the reign of Augustus, among the eight colonies established in Pisidia, only Antioch was honoured with the title of Caesarea and given the right of the &quot;Ius Italicum&quot;, maybe because of its strategic position. The city became an important Roman colony. It rose to the position of a capital city with the name of &quot;Colonia Caesarea&quot;.

Hellenisation became Latinization during the Roman period, and it was most successful in Antioch. The city was divided into seven districts called &quot;vici&quot; each of which was founded on one of the city&#x27;s seven hills like the seven hills of Rome. The formal language was Latin until the end of the 3rd century AD. The fertility of the land and the peace brought by Augustus (&quot;Pax Romana&quot;: Roman Peace) made it easier for the veterans as colonists in the area to have good relations and integration with the natives.

One of the three surviving copies of the &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot;, the famous inscription recording the noble deeds of the Emperor Augustus, was found in front of the Augusteum in Antioch. The original was carved on bronze tablets and exhibited in front of the Mausoleum of Augustus in Rome, but unfortunately has not survived. The Antioch copy was inscribed in stone in Latin, a sign of the importance of the city as a military and cultural base of Rome in Asia. (One of the copies, in Greek and Latin, is in Ankara, the other, in Greek, in Apollonia -Uluborlu).

===Early Christian-Byzantine period===
Paul the Apostle and Barnabas, as recounted in the Acts of the Apostles, visited Antioch of Pisidia in the course of Paul&#x27;s first missionary journey, and Paul&#x27;s sermon in the Jewish synagogue there caused a great stir among the citizens, but the ensuing conflict with the Jews led to the expulsion of the two Christian missionaries from the city. They returned later and appointed elders for the Christian community there. Paul also visited the region in both his second and his third journeys. Paul&#x27;s &quot;persecutions and sufferings&quot; at Antioch are spoken of in .

In the 6th century the city of Antioch, which had been ranked as a Roman &quot;colonia&quot; an outpost established in conquered territory to secure it, lost its strategic importance and, as it was off the main trade route, it started to lose importance more generally.

===Bishopric===
Amid the remains of ancient Antioch, beneath a ruined Byzantine church, which claims to mark the location of Paul&#x27;s synagogue sermon, archaeologists have uncovered a first-century building that may have been that synagogue.

As capital of the Roman province of Pisidia, Antioch was a metropolitan see. The &quot;Notitia Episcopatuum&quot; of Pseudo-Epiphanius, composed during the rule of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius in about 640, lists as its suffragan sees: Philomelium, Sagalassos, Sozopolis in Pisidia, Apamea Cibotus, Tyriacum, Baris in Pisidia, Hadrianopolis in Pisidia, Limnae, Neapolis, Laodicea Combusta, Seleucia Ferrea, Adada, Zarzela, Tymbrias, Tymandus, Justinianopolis in Pisidia, Metropolis in Pisidia, and Pappa. There is evidence that Prostanna and Atenia were also suffragans of Antioch. In the &quot;Notitia Episcopatuum&quot; attributed to Leo V the Wise, Neapolis, which had become a metropolitan see, Philomelium, and Justinianopolis have been removed from the list of suffragans of the suffragans of Antioch, but Binda, Conana, Parlais, Malus, Siniandus, and Tityassus are added.

===Muslim invasions===

The Byzantine Empire directed its economic, political and military power to the southeast because the warriors of a new religion from the Arab Peninsula were invading the farthest borders of the Empire. The Arab raids from the sea and land weakened the empire, besieging the capital city Constantinople several times. Anatolian cities were damaged by these raids, and they began to be abandoned. In the 8th century the raids increased. The fiercest attack of all against Antioch was conducted in 713 by the Umayyad prince al-Abbas ibn al-Walid, the son of Caliph al-Walid I. Antioch never recovered and centuries of glory vanished.

After Antioch was visited by crusaders, a new people appeared in the 11th century: the Seljuk Turks, who captured the area and founded the Anatolian Seljuk Empire (Sultanate) in Central Anatolia. Until the 12th century Antioch was a base where soldiers stopped for a rest, constantly changing hands. On 11 September 1176, the armies of the Byzantine Empire and the Seljuk Sultanate met at Myriokephalon (thousand heads). Its exact location is unknown, but it is widely accepted that it was somewhere near Yalvaç. Sultan Kılıçarslan won the battle against Manuel I Comnenus.

The Turks settled in the valley instead of on the acropolis. Because they controlled the whole of central Anatolia, they did not need defensive walls, and the valley was very suitable for agriculture. They did not change the names of most of the captured cities, but the name of Antioch was forgotten and, with no Christians left in the region, they named it &quot;Yalvaç&quot; which means &quot;Prophet&quot;, perhaps a reference to Saint Paul.

===Archaeology===
Francis Vyvyan Jago Arundell, British chaplain at İzmir between 1822 and 1834, was the first person to identify and study the city. In 1828 he published the record of his first journey to inner Anatolia made in 1826 as &quot;A visit to the seven Churches of Asia&quot;. His notes after his second journey in 1833 were published the following year in London under the title &quot;Discoveries in Asia Minor: including a description of the ruins of several ancient cities and especially Antioch of Pisidia&quot;.

W. J. Hamilton came to the region, passing over the Sultan Mountains and observed the aqueducts, bath, and great basilica. His notes were published in 1842 as &quot;Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus, Armenia&quot;. He was followed at different periods by noted explorers of the 19th century such as Tchihatcheff, Laborde, Ritter, Richter, but none of them have the power of Arundell&#x27;s detailed study, until Ramsay.

William Mitchell Ramsay, who devoted 50 years of his life to the historical geography of Asia Minor, made his first journey to Anatolia in 1880. Together with J. R. S. Sterrett he embarked on two journeys studying inscriptions which provided detailed historical information. On both journeys they visited Antioch. In the same period Weber concentrated his studies on aqueducts, examining the water system and identifying the monumental fountain. The results of Ramsay&#x27;s studies up to 1905 were published in 1907 as &quot;The Cities of St. Paul. Their influence on his Life and Thought&quot;.

In 1911 Ramsay and his wife W. M. Calder, along with M. M. Hardie, made camp in Antioch and started to study the area systematically. Calder and Hardie explored the Sanctuary of Men Askaenos which is on Karakuyu Hill 5 km to the southeast of Antioch. The following year, excavations were made under the direction of Ramsay, supported by Princeton University. During these excavations up to 1914, some important buildings were discovered in and around the city. In 1914 one of the breathtaking finds of archaeology, the &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot;, appeared as fragments in front of the Imperial Sanctuary. After a compulsory break during World War I, Ramsay returned in 1923.

In 1924 a major expedition was mounted by Francis Kelsey of the University of Michigan which included Ramsay. The excavations were under the direction of D.M. Robinson, employing at times over 200 men from Yalvaç. The team exposed the Great Basilica, Tiberia Platea, Propylon and the monumental western gate. Then after only one year of excavation, the work of the Michigan group ceased due to a bitter quarrel between Ramsay and Robinson.

The only person who might have had the authority to resolve matters was Kelsey, and he died in 1927. Ramsay visited again between 1925 and 1927 but without any major results. No further studies were made until the 1960s. During this long interval, local natives carried off many of the architectural blocks from these major buildings to use in the construction of modern Yalvaç. By the early 1960s, when Yalvaç Museum was about to be built, Antioch had become buried again.

In 1962 M. H. Ballance and A. Frazer conducted a detailed survey. K. Tuchelt came to the city in 1976 and caused some new arguments about the Imperial Sanctuary. Stephen Mitchell and Marc Waelkens conducted a survey and documentation of Antioch between 1982 and 1983. Using their discoveries and drawing from earlier studies, especially those of the University of Michigan in 1924, they subsequently brought together all the available information about the city, supported with new finds, in a book entitled &quot;Pisidian Antioch&quot; (1998).

Today&#x27;s Antioch is studied by Dr. Mehmet Taşlıalan, Director of Yalvaç Museum (1979–2002), and Tekin Bayram, Mayor of Yalvaç. Taşlıalan wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the Imperial Sanctuary and described the building others called the Great Basilica as the Church of St.Paul.

===Acropolis and fortifications===
The city, like other Hellenistic colonies, was founded on a hill for ease of defense. The steep valley of the River Anthius in the east provides a perfect defense. On the other slopes the acropolis goes up smoothly in terraces, reaching a height of 60 meters above the plain. It is not known whether the bastions of semi-circular plan, which can be seen in the West, continue in other parts of the defensive walls.

The city is surrounded by re-used blocks made of mainly local, grey limestone. The massive blocked wall structure of the earlier phases are different from the mortared Byzantine-Early Christian walls. No clear evidence of defensive towers has yet been found. Curved semi-circular walls in the south and north would have made it easier to defend the fortifications. The defensive system, when the masonry of the walls is considered, is very similar to the neighbouring colonies Cremna, Sagalassos and even Aphrodisias in Caria. Most of the walls and defensive system are from the 4th century CE. Other buried entrances and fortifications datable back to the Hellenistic period will no doubt come to light as excavations continue.

The acropolis was a defended space to which natives retreated during wartime or invasion: houses and farms however, were outside the walls. Especially in the west and east, on the slopes going down to the plain the remains of houses have been found. The location of the necropolis is not known, but pieces of sarcophagi, Phrygian door-tombstones and funeral inscriptions in the walls of the houses in the modern Kızılca Quarter are indications that the necropolis should be looked for nearby.

===City plan===
Most of the city has not been excavated, leaving questions like, for example, the relationship between the Theatre and the Cardo Maximus not yet fully explained. Much is still buried under the hills in the potential excavation area of 800 by 1000 meters. Electromagnetic studies in recent years have shown that the Hippodamic plan with streets at right-angles was applied successfully like at Priene and Miletos. The city was divided by the streets into districts (&quot;vicus&quot;, plural &quot;vici&quot;). The names of the following vici are known from inscriptions: Venerius, Velabrus, Aediculus, Patricius, Cermalus, Salutaris and Tuscus, but their extent has yet to be established.

One of the two principal streets is the Decumanus Maximus which starts from the Western City Gate and it is 90 x 320 m long. The other. the Cardo Maximus, is 400 m. long and starts from the Nympheum, crossing the Decumanus c. 70 m south of the Tiberia Platea. On both sides of the streets are ruins dating back to the 1st–2nd centuries AD. The name Platea is used for large areas of street-squares surrounded by shops and porticos. In the eastern Roman provinces, the platea became colonnaded streets. The discovery of monumental buildings and especially of several nympheums on both sides of these two colonnaded main streets prove that this was something which occurred in Antioch also.

===Tour of Antioch after Ünal Demirer===
Arriving at Antioch from the west, visitors can see the fortifications and structures of various periods. Architectural fragments of the City Gate by the main street are awaiting re-erection. The road through the gate passes the ruins of the Waterfall and turns to the right at the beginning of the Decumanus Maximus, which has been excavated recently.

In this street, one can see the damaged drainage system and wear from the wheels of vehicles, and after passing the Theatre, one turns left into the second important street, the Cardo Maximus.

The Cardo leads the visitor to the Tiberia Platea and Central Church with buildings from later periods on either side. The remains of the 12 steps up to the monumental Propylon take one to the most impressive architectural structure which has survived from the earlier periods of Antioch: the Imperial Sanctuary-Augusteum.

Going back to the Tiberia Platea and following the Cardo to the right will take one to the source of life of the city: the Nympheum. The aqueducts which can be seen behind the Nympheum brought fresh water from springs in the Sultan Mountains 11 km from the city over the centuries. 
The Bath which is some distance from the water source, is to the west of the Nympheum and is in good condition. On the way to the Great Basilica, which can be seen from any high point of the city, one can see the small valley created by the horseshoe shaped Stadion. The tour ends back at the Western Gate.

==City gate==
Facing the valley in the west, the Western Gate is most probably the main entrance to the city as a number of ancient roads meet here. It is supported by the city walls on both sides. Like 40% of the monumental gates in Anatolia it is a three-vaulted victory arch. In architectural structure and in ornament, the gate was influenced by the pre-existing Propylon (the entrance to the Imperial Sanctuary).

It was excavated in 1924 by the University of Michigan team. The gate had inscriptions on both sides. These were mounted on architraves and were formed from individually cast bronze letters which had mounting lugs on their reverses. These lugs were fixed with lead into holes cut in the stone.

These letters are now missing, but in 1924 one stone was found which still had letters in position. It read: C.IVL.ASP. Robinson jumped to the conclusion that this referred to Caius Julius Asper who was proconsul of the Province of Asia in AD 212 and for many years this was taken as the date of construction of the gate.

Over the last ten years Dr Maurice Byrne has been working on the gate and the archives of the 1924 expedition. He has found that Robinson&#x27;s own records show that lying on the ground next to the stone with the letters was another which had broken off it. This stone continued the name and showed that it was not that of the proconsul, but of a member of a distinguished Antioch family, the Pansiniani, who are known of over a number of generations.

Many of the stones from the inscriptions on both sides of the gate are missing (in 1924 one of these was found in the local graveyard acting as a tombstone). Dr Byrne&#x27;s present reading of the inscriptions (or rather of the holes into which they were mounted) is:

Inner side:


&quot;Caius Julius Asper Pansinianus, mayor for the fifth time (or for five years), military tribune of the first legion, prefect of the foreign cavalry composed of soldiers from ... (here a stone is missing) constructed and ornamented (this gate) from his own money.&quot;

Outer side:

&quot;For the Emperor Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus, grandson of the deified Nerva, son of the deified Traianus, Pontifex Maximus, Tribunus for the 13th time, Consul for the 3rd time, Pater Patriae (Father of the land) and for Sabina Augusta...the colony.&quot;

This outer inscription makes it possible to date the gate to the year AD 129 AD when Hadrian visited Asia Minor. The gates at Antalya and Phaselis were also built during this period. It is a possibility that further work was done on the gate at a later date which was recorded by the internal inscription.

Monumental gates in Roman cities, especially in colonies were built as victory arches to symbolize the military power of Roman authority. The main gate in Antioch decorated with nikes, weapons, armour, bucrania and garlands is a perfect example of this tradition.

==The waterfall==
On the main axis of the street through the gate, about 7 m into the city, the remains of a semi-circular ended pool can be seen. This stands at the bottom of a waterfall which consisted of a series of tanks 2 meters wide and 0.80 m high. These rose up the hill to the Decumanus Maximus and water flowed down the hill from tank to tank. This must have been a most welcome sight to thirsty travellers on a hot summer&#x27;s day. A similar waterfall is known at Perge. The water system feeding the waterfall is not yet clear and awaits investigation at the start of the Decumanus Maximus.

==The theatre==

Beyond the City Gate the Decumanus Maximus begins. Fifty meters up this street there is the entrance to the theatre. Unfortunately little more than the semi-circular seating survives. It is rather difficult to get an idea of a typical Graeco-Roman building from its present condition. The blocks of the &quot;cavea&quot; (auditorium), &quot;diazoma&quot; (dividing corridor of the auditorium), &quot;kerkidai&quot; (climbing steps), entrances and the orchestra have been carried away for later period constructions in Antioch and in Yalvaç. Arundell observed that many blocks had been removed when he identified the theatre in 1833.

During the recent clearing by Dr.Taşlıalan it is understood that the width of the scene building at the back of the theatre is c. 100 meters. So we can compare the building to the theatre of Aspendos in Pamphylia with its capacity of 12,000 people. It is rather bigger and larger than the other important Pisidian city theatres at Sagalassos, Termessos and Selge.

The theatre was enlarged in the period AD 311–13. This involved building above the Decumanus Maximus which was taken through a tunnel 5 m wide and 55 m long. An inscription which was at the entrance to the tunnel dates this enlargement. The original architecture can be dated back to the founding of the colony or may go back to the Hellenistic age. Further excavation is needed.

==Central church==
At the end of the Decumanus Maximus a left turn takes one into the Cardo Maximus, leading after 75 meters to the Central Church.

The church is on the axis of the Platea, Propylon, and Augusteum and was so named by researchers because of its topographical position. One apse which was then visible had been identified as part of a church by Arundell, but none of the further researchers were interested in the building until 1924, when it was excavated and the architect Woodbridge drew a rough plan. It was thought that the church had a small Latin-cross plan, but continuing excavations in 1927 by Ramsay and in the present by Taşlıalan have shown that the central church has a larger and a more orthodox plan.

Ramsay carried out unrecorded excavations in 1927 and found an iron seal with the names of three martyrs from the period of Diocletian: Neon, Nikon and Heliodorus. Taşlıalan adds the name of St. Bassus of Antioch to this finding and the church is known as St. Bassus Church today.

Ramsay went deeper to earlier phases of the church and found another apse in the south of the church. He thought that this earlier apse had been built on the synagogue in which St.Paul preached to the first Christians of Antioch. The details of the plan and connections between the two apses and the construction phases are not clear because of unsystemathic digging. So the 4th century date given by Ramsay can be taken forward about a century because new results from Mitchell&#x27;s survey and Taşlıalan&#x27;s excavations.

==Tiberia Platea==
Opposite the central church, at the end of an 11 m wide and 85 m long street can be seen the stairs of the Propylon. This large street was decorated with colonnades and statues on both sides. There is still an argument whether the name &quot;Tiberia Platea&quot; (Tiberius square) should be given to the whole street complex or only to the 30 m wide square in front of the Propylon. The architectural plan of the shops behind the porticos on both sides of the large street-square and the connection between square and street are evidence that the whole complex up to the Propylon can be named as the Tiberia Platea.

The 1924 finds: inscriptions, altars, drinking cups, eating or preserving pottery, several kitchen tools and hundreds of coins show that the shops were like little restaurants and bars. Because of the central situation of the Platea and its close proximity to the Imperial Sanctuary we can say that this place was at the heart of urban life in its time.

The name of the Platea is known from the famous inscription recording the edict governing the hoarding of grain made by L. Antistius Rusticus, governor of Galatia-Cappadocia. The inscription is in Afyon Museum today. Robinson and Ramsay published it in the same year in different articles, each claiming the right of publication. This was the opening round in a series of increasingly rancorous publications by these two scholars. As a consequence of this quarrel the Americans did not return after 1924 and the well-shaped paving blocks of this ownerless area were pulled up and used for road building or for modern buildings in Yalvaç as late as the 1970s.

A short wander amongst the older houses of Yalvaç will reveal many ornamental pieces from the Augusteum, Tiberia Platea, Propylon and other important buildings of Antioch. It is certain that many pieces lie beneath the foundations of mud-brick walls which are now covered by the risen level of the streets.

Over two hundred further pieces of the Monumentum Ancyranum (Res Gestae Divi Augusti) whose first fragments were found in 1914, were also found during the 1924 excavations of the Platea. The restored remains of nearly 60 pieces are on display in Yalvaç Museum.

In 1924, 20 meters from the Propylon and at the south corner of the Platea, architectural blocks from an eight-columned circular building were unearthed. This little tholos (rotunda) was built on a square base of side 5.20 m. It appears that the Ionic and composite columns were standing directly on the stylobate without column bases. The building was covered with a conical stone roof decorated in imitation of tiling and looking like fish scales. From the remains of an inscription reading ...I ANTONINI AUG. on a cornice block which can still be seen at the site, one learns that the tholos belongs to the period of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Caracalla) who became Augustus in 198 and died in 217.

As a characteristic of the period are concentrated drillwork and light contrast in the stonemasonship of the building. There are several similar examples of a tholos in other metropolitan cities of antiquity, for example at Pergamon and Ephesus. Meanwhile, the small inscription on the cornice shows us the importance of epigraphy for dating archaeological remains.

During the Michigan excavations in 1924 a square block of side 1.7 m was found set into the pavement on the main axis of the Propylon, Platea and Augusteum.

It bore an inscription on a domed circular panel. This was originally formed from bronze letters recessed into the stone. Although the bronze letters were missing it was possible to read the whole inscription. Because it was too heavy to carry away or because there were many well-shaped blocks nearby the block was not removed although it has been damaged. It can be seen at the site today. The inscription, which dates to the first building phase of the Platea in 25–50 AD, records the gift of our citizen Baebius Asiaticus who paid for the paving of the street:

&quot;T.BAEBIUS T.F.SER[GIA]&quot;
&quot;ASIATICUS&quot;
&quot;AED[ILIS]&quot;
&quot;III[MIL] PEDUM D[E] S[UA] P[ECUNIA]&quot;
&quot;STRAVIT&quot;

&quot;Titus Baebius Asiaticus, son of Titus, of the tribe Sergia, Aedile (Mayor)
paved 3000 feet from his own money.&quot;

It is clear, as Mitchell has pointed out, exactly where these 3000 feet paved by Baebius were. This is because 3000 Roman feet, each of 0.296 m, fit the total lengths of the Decumanus and Cardo (810 m) plus that of the Platea (70 m) = 880 m or 2973 Roman feet.

Another find in the Platea is a fountain block. The remains of a water system made out of earthenware tubes can be seen in the Platea today. This system distributed water which came from the nympheum to the shops from a fountain under the second column of the Propylon to the north.

==Propylon==
The 12 steps at the end of the Tiberia Platea are all that remain of the Propylon, a monumental passage gateway leading up to the Imperial Sanctuary. Woodbridge, the architect of the 1924 excavations proposed a reconstruction of the Propylon which is still accepted today.

It was triple-arched and highly ornamented with its massive entablature carried by four columns in front and four at the rear. The building was an exemplar not only for the later Western City Gate but also for many other victory arches in Anatolia. The Propylon was built to honour Augustus who, as Octavian, had won the sea-battle of Actium against Marcus Antonius in 31 BC and thus became the single power of the Roman world. The aim of the decoration of the building is to commemorate the naval and other victories of Augustus.

The Sanctuary beyond the gate provides the function for the building. The discovery of many fragments of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti in front of the Propylon is further confirmation. Although there is not agreement on the exact position where the stone panels bearing the inscription were mounted on the Propylon, it is clear that the letters of the inscription (the remains of which are in Yalvaç Museum) were intended to be read at eye level.

The most recent work on the bronze letter inscriptions which were mounted on the architraves of both sides of the central entrance has been done by Dr. Maurice Byrne. He located in the 1924 photographic archive evidence of three stones which have been lost subsequently. These show that the same inscription was mounted on both sides of the building, but that the vertical alignment of the letters in the two lines of the inscription differed by the width of one letter between the two sides. The inscription reads:

&quot;IMP. CAES[ARI. DI]VI. [F. A]VGVSTO. PONTI[F]ICI.&quot;
&quot;M[AXIM]O COS. X[III.TRIB]UN[ICIAE.]POTESTATIS.&quot;
&quot;XXII.[IM]P.XIIII. P.[P.]&quot;

&quot;For the emperor Caesar Augustus, son of a god, pontifex maximus, consul for the 13th time, with tribunician power for the 22nd time, imperator for the 14th time, father of the country.&quot;
The inscription is a dedication to Augustus who became Pater Patriae on 5 February 2 BC. A similar briefer inscription exists on an Imperial Temple at Pola:

&quot;ROMAE ET AVGVSTO CAESARI DIVI F. PATRI PATRIAE.&quot;

The width of the central entrance is 4.5 metres and of the side entrances 3.5 m. Both upper sides of the central arch were decorated with two face-to-face Pisidian captives, one of them naked, whose hands are tied at the back. The side entrances are decorated with Eros and Nike face-to-face and carrying garlands. There was a frieze on the architrave ornamented with symbols of victory, several weapons, armour and tritons.

Without Woodbridge&#x27;s reconstruction it is impossible to recreate the shape of the Propylon from what can be seen today. The structure has been totally destroyed and blocks may have been used in later defences, or in buildings in Yalvaç.

==Augusteum/Sebasteion (sanctuary of the imperial cult)==
The most effective, most monumental complex at Antioch is reached after climbing the twelve steps of the Propylon. The temple that was constructed at the highest point of the city by cutting away the rock has on first sight a stunning effect on the visitor with its ornamental and architectural richness.
The Augusteum was one of the first places to be dug by Ramsay&#x27;s team in 1913. Callander, a member of the team, wrote with emotion on their work at the Augusteum. Current thinking is that construction of the temple started when Augustus was alive and that it was dedicated to him after his death. The complex seen now is contemporary with the Propylon and Platea but there are some traces on the rock that the area could have been used for another cult in earlier times.

When a large section of the mound was cut away to form the semicircle and smooth the area, a huge block, 14x28 m and 2.5 m high, was left in the centre as a podium for the temple. The interior of this podium was carved out to form a cult room (Naos).

There were twelve steps up to the temple, like at the Propylon, and the order was a four columned prostylos. The 8.72 m high fluted drum-columns, which stood on Anatolian type bases, carried with their Corinthian capitals a three-fascia architrave. On the architrave there was a frieze of garlands and bucrania. The entablature was surmounted with a tympanon which had an epiphania window (at which god showed himself to the people) in the middle, surrounded with lotus and palmet leaves.

The ornamental richness of the building is completed with a floral frieze on the walls of the cella. Important parts of the friezes are well-preserved and can be seen at the site and in Yalvaç Museum but unfortunately the same cannot be said about the columns and other architectural blocks.

In the surrounding sanctuary, which measures c. 100x85 m, the perimeter of the semi-circular area was covered with a portico. At each end of this portico, on the south and north sides there were stoas. The stoas and portico are connected to each other organically and in the area carved from the rock, the broken surfaces were renovated with local limestones. The stoas at the sides were one floored with Doric columns. The semi-circular portico had two floors, the lower with Doric columns without bases and the upper with fine Ionic columns. In reconstruction tests it is believed that about 150 columns were used in the monumental construction.

The excavators reported that the rock was covered with a hard stucco-like mortar. The regular rectangular holes were for beams carrying the second floor of the portico and the occasional rectangular holes of different size were possibly for the scaffolding put up during the construction and then filled with mortar.

===Nympheum and water supply system===
After returning to the Cardo Maximus from the Augusteum and continuing to the north of the city, the Nympheum waits at the beginning of Cardo. The building is a large U-shape and was built to collect water brought by the aqueduct and distribute it throughout the city.

The Nympheum complex included a reservoir 27x3 m to collect incoming water, an ornamented facade building 9 m high and a pool 27 by 7 m and 1.5 m deep. Just behind the complex, the remains of the aqueduct which brought water to the city from the &quot;Suçıkan&quot; source in Sultan Mountains c. 11 km away, can be seen. The modern town of Yalvaç uses the same water from the same source today.

The excavations in the nympheum only reveal the foundations and it is difficult to interpret the ornaments of the facade from only a few fine marble remains, but no doubt these were similar to those in other Roman cities. No inscription has been found associated with the building.

In Imperial Rome, aqueducts appeared with the development of urbanism and a well-preserved example of such a structure can be seen at Antioch. Especially as a result of the Pax Romana (Roman Peace), the problem of supplying the needs of fast growing populations was solved by these structures. The aqueduct arches were constructed robustly to bear the weight of the water and they are still standing despite many earthquakes.

In Antioch the water, which comes from an altitude of 1465 m in the mountains, is conveyed the 11 km to the city sometimes in channels, sometimes in tunnels and sometimes on arches of one or two stories, according to the terrain, in stone and earthenware tubes to the nympheum which is at 1178 m.

This gives an average slope of 2.6% along the 287 m difference of altitude between the source and nympheum. The water pressure along such a slope is high and the pressure of flow was lowered by phases and when the water arrived at the syphon aqueducts at the end of the system, the flow was controlled with a slope of only 0.02%. As a result of this feat of experimental engineering 3000 cubic meters of water was distributed to the city daily without any problems for centuries. The height of nympheum should therefore be at least 9 m to give water to the higher points of city like the Platea, and Owens has suggested that part of the supply was a sealed pressurised tube.

Around 200 meters of the aqueduct can be seen on the hills and the ruined parts can be followed along a line right up to the nympheum.

The height of the arches which are still standing varies between 5 and 7 m and the massive blocked pylons are on average 4 m high and have a floor area of . The blocks are bossaged with a deep anathrosys and this gives an effect of solidity to the whole structure. The lines beneath the arch feet hide the heaviness of the structure and give a lightness of appearance. There are no ornaments on the keystones showing us that the building was primarily functional. The distance between two pylons varies between 3.8 and 4.7 m.

The key-stones are sometimes single, sometimes double, and the masonship of the round arches is different but the aqueduct appears as a unity. The cause of this strength or solidity depends on the perfectionism of the arch architecture.

The entablature is completely ruined, but many of the stone tubes for the water supply (Specus Canalis) with c. 25 cm holes can be seen in the area.

The nympheum and water supply system is dated to the first half of the 1st century when Antioch became Colonia Caesarea.

==The Bath==
The bath lies at the northwest corner of the city and the building did not receive much interest from researchers over the last 150 years. Most of them identified the building as an arched, colossal complex but none of them had anything to say about the function of the building. Seven section of the building have been unearthed by the excavations directed by Taşlıalan in recent years, but an important part of the complex, which is 70x55 m, is still buried and the plan is not yet clear. There is still some uncertainty whether the building is in fact a bath or not.

For example, because of sun and wind factors, the entrances to bath-houses in Anatolia were made on the south or east sides, but here the situation is different, the entrances are on the west and north-west sides. Also there are not clear traces of a water supply and heating system and in this situation the building rather looks like the lower part of a huge building that bore a massive structure above on its strong arches. Also because of the slope of the area on which it is constructed, the arches provide a solution so that the complex looks like the foundations for a building on a slope. For instance at Pergamon the same remedy was used for the Trajaneum.

But until further excavations prove the contrary the building can be accepted as a bath house which it resembles.

Treating it as a bath, the building is a reasonable distance from the nympheum. The exterior of the walls of the building on the north side are similar to the semi-circular fortifications of the western city walls. So it is possible that the massive external walls of the structure were also used for fortification in an as yet unrecognized plan and the small entrance in the north wall was used for the supply of wood needed for heating. The stonemasonship of the building is the strongest work visible at Antioch and it looks as if it will keep the building standing for many thousand years yet to come.

In the rooms cleared during the excavations it is understood that some places were filled deliberately. The style of the blocked and mortar-filled walls show the techniques of different centuries and show that the building was used over an extended period and possibly for different purposes also.

The court which is 38 by 29 m, identified as a palaestra, at the east side of the complex is connected to the building in an organic way. The court is surrounded with a colonaded-portico but the plan is not yet clear.

In one room, the remains of a floor heating system (Hypocaust) is visible as baked-clay tubes and rectangular brick-columns, but this would not reach the central heating oven of the building which should be at east or south side, if the building is a bath. It will be possible to understand the functions and phases of the building by continuing the excavations and in this situation the building may be comparable with the bath-house of Sagalassos in Pisidia which is 80x55 m. The beginning of the building phases can be dated to the first half of the 1st century AD. like the aqueduct and nympheum.

==Stadium==
Outside the late period defence walls and opposite the Great Basilica, a small valley can be discerned. It has been recognized as a stadium only recently. The building blocks have all gone but traces of a U-shaped stadium c. 190x30 m for athletic games and competitions can be seen.

==The great basilica==

One of the most important building complexes of Antioch is the Great Basilica in the northwest of the city, close to the outer walls. Arundell first identified the building as a basilica and the plan published by him became a guide for subsequent researchers. The Basilica was excavated first in 1924 by the Michigan team and it was then buried again for 80 years until the outside of the building was cleared by Taşlıalan who has most recently made a sondage in the apse.

The building lies in the east–west direction and is 70 by 27 m The narthex which is 27 by 13 m bears against the defence walls. The format reflects all the specifications of a basilica with an apse, a large nave in the middle and two narrow ones at the sides. The outer wall of the apse is of hectagonal plan.

The basilica shows changes to its plan over time. Possibly at the end of the 4th century the apse and naves were filled up to the level of the floor visible today and the filled area was pressed and covered with mosaics. Three new entrances were added to the building on the north side in this phase and the courtyard on the north side also dated to this period. The central axis of the basilica is different from the central axis of the mosaic floor, showing changes of structure. The mosaic which was unearthed by Robinson&#x27;s team is covered with c. 30 cm of earth today, and 1924 photographs show that it was of geometrical floral motives in rectangular frames.

In the central nave at the beginning of the apse where there should be an altar a mosaic inscription was found giving the name of Bishop Optimus who represented Antioch at the Council of Constantinople in 381. This date is at the beginning of the building of basilical churches in Asia Minor. It also consolidates the dating of the Great Basilica. So, the Great Basilica of Antioch is known as one of the two earliest examples of Early Christian churches in Anatolia. The other example is in another Antioch on the Orontes (Hatay) dedicated to St. Babylas in Daphne.

The apse is 10.8 m in diameter and the central nave is separated by two rows of 13 columns standing on hectagonal bases. Beneath the filling, there are earlier construction phases of the naves. The recent sondage shows traces of an arched foundation on both sides. Possibly the second floor was carried on this. These vaults were subsequently filled and the columns of the Optimus phase erected on this filled surface. Three gates were added to the north wall of which the central one is 4 m wide and two were added to the south wall. The northern entrances open onto the central ceremonial court which is surrounded with an L–shaped portico. All the material of this court is reused from earlier buildings. In the north of the court a baptistery pool was added to the basilical complex and the foundations of a mosaic paved building beside the pool may possibly be a bishops residence.

There is no church comparable to the basilica in Pisidia and it is earlier than the churches of Sagalassos, Thekla, Anabarzus and Korykos. Evidence from the late 4th century like the enlarged theatre, a new agora, enlarged fortifications show that the city had one of its most brilliant eras at the beginning of the 5th century.

Dr.Taşlıalan identified the Great Basilica as the &quot;Church of St.Paul&quot; by means of an altar which was found in Yalvaç market place and he claims that the wall foundations at the south side of the basilica belong to the synagogue where St.Paul first preached to the Gentiles.

The altar is dated to the 6th century and the rough inscription is easily readable as &quot;AGIOS PAULOS&quot;. W.M. Calder is the first who mentions this altar, found in the Yalvaç Baths, in his reports of 1911 and he said it could be belong to an unknown Church of St.Paul. Podromos, the Greek guide of Calder, was the first man who translated the inscription on the altar.

It is not clear if the basilica was used for another purpose in its earlier levels. Conservation and lifting of the mosaics will give opportunities to go deeper into the naves of Optimus and this will shed further light on this important Antioch building.

==The sanctuary of Men Askaenos==
A sanctuary exists on the neighbouring hill east of Antioch, which is about 1600 m high, that 6 km away from Antioch(3.5 km as the crow flies) dedicated to one of the mystic gods of Anatolia: Men Askaenos. The hill is known as Gemen Korusu (grove of Gemen) or Karakuyu (blackwell, because of a dried spring beside a church from the times of the Byzantine Empire). Even today the hill is rendered attractive by means of the sacred trees of the Father God(Patrios Theos)of Antioch, pine trees. The sanctuary was founded on a high hill to see the Beyşehir Lake in southeast, Eğirdir Lake in southwest and the territory of Antioch 400 meters below.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the discoverer of Antioch wondered about the sanctuary that Strabo mentions in his Geography, and Ramsay&#x27;s team found a sacred processional road with votive steles on either side leading up to the sanctuary. And the researchers met there with a temple in a temenos, another smaller one, a stadion, andron, ceremonial hall, Byzantine church and house-shaped unidentified buildings. Inscriptions indicate that a strong cult of a local belief reigned in sanctuary in a long period between the 4th century BC and 4th century AD. Many of them are carved directly on the walls of the temple with very distinctive lunar signs. 

Ramsay and Hardie identified the Temple of Men as a &quot;Great Altar&quot; maybe from its similarity to Pergamon Altar. The next year they recognized the building and identified as &quot;an unusual shaped small temple&quot;.

On temenos walls especially on the south –southwest side that looks to Antioch they discovered many inscriptions on votive steles dedicated to Men begging help, health, protection; telling sins, dreams, wishing forgiving and giving thanks, shortly shared lives with the Patrios Theos.

The temple is a peripteral Ionic ordered temple with 11x6 columns. The measures are 31x17.4 in podium base and 25x12.5 on the podium. There are 10 steps in southwest–northwest sides and 6 steps in southeast–northeast sides of the podium.

The site and other buildings are in a bad condition. Although it has been surveyed, the site has not been excavated yet. With the growth of Christianity, sites of local polytheistic religions of Anatolia and imported cults like emperors were systematically damaged in the 4th century. This is why even plan specifications of the buildings cannot be clearly seen in the present day.

==Yalvaç museum==
Continuing research in the area makes Yalvaç a centre for interest in the Pisidian Region. Even from the early years of the last century research and excavations led to the need for a museum. Some early finds went to the Museum at Konya. The artifacts that were found in the American excavations were at first kept in the High School, but as the natives started to bring many different objects there, it became necessary to build a museum in Yalvaç. In 1947 even the excavations stopped for this coming inflating objects a storage room built.

For some time objects were displayed in Yalvaç Public Library but the need continues and the present building was started in 1963 and finished in 1966.
The museum consisting of a Prehistoric hall, a classical hall, an ethnographic hall, with the garden in the centre, and is open every day, except Monday, between 08.30 and 17.30.

===The Pre-History Hall===
Just at the left side of the entrance, fossil finds are on display, which were found at Tokmacık (a small town 17 km from Yalvaç). They are the remains of several mammals belonging to the Late Miocene Era, 7 million to 8 million years old.

In continuous windows, early Bronze Age finds by villagers and surveyors who explored around the 17 prehistoric-settled mounds of the Yalvaç region are on display. These objects, baked clay cups and jars, several stone objects, axes, weights, seals, and figurines reflect the characteristic style of the Lake District.

===The Classical Hall===
This hall is in the central part of the museum and mostly contains finds from the excavations at Antioch. On display are statues, statue fragments, portraits and reliefs, all reflecting the culture of a Roman colony that melded in Anatolian pot.

Objects of daily use, such as jars, jewellery, perfume bottles, terracotta and bronze figurines together with marble statuettes, votive steles from the Men Sanctuary, and early examples of Christian crosses are on display forming a rich, concentrated collection.

===Ethnographic Hall===
Some beautiful examples of Turkish culture, which had settled in Yalvaç from the 12th century, are exhibited in this gallery. Particularly impressive are the carved wooden chimneys, ceilings, doors and wardrobes. In other cabinets, objects of daily use, such as dresses, jewellery, weapons, and medals are on display.

===The Garden===
This contains some representative examples of architecture from the site of Antioch together with many stones found in Yalvaç and its surroundings.

The development of the museum is continued by research. There is now a need for a larger museum for the display of objects in storage. The coins, manuscripts, weapons, reliefs and statue fragments are still waiting to be exhibited in new galleries.

==Surrounding villages==
It is believed that the villages around Yalvaç may have lineage of the ancient city of Antiochia in Psidia. An English explorer named Mitchell Ramsay drew a link to the workers class ancient ionian settlers in the region to the village of Manarga in the vicinity of Yalvaç. He assumed the name of this village to be &#x27;man-arga&#x27; or meaning &#x27;worker folk&#x27; in ancient Anatolian Greek. Their deity was Hephaestus, the god of all skilful things and labour-saving devices. This village has been renamed Dedeçam. Ramsay speaks of two other settler folk named Geleontes and Aigikoreis, being farmers and priests respectively.

In addition, there are two other villages in the vicinity of the village of Manarga, which are Gelemi/Gelegemi and Oekuenes. These villages are at 1 km distance from each other, and their names strikingly reveal similarities with the Geleontes (farm folk) and the Aigikoreis (priests). In the village of Oekuenes, which is situated on top of a hill, there is an old sand road leading towards Yalvaç, and thus may have been used in antiquity to go to the ancient city of Antiochia in Pisidia. The city centre of the village of Manargs has a very high hill, and there have been found ancient human bones in the vicinity.

Ramsey speaks of a fourth ionian settler tribe, namely the hoplites (soldiers), and mentions that Antioch in Pisidia was a garrison city to hold off invasions from native non-Greeks. It is highly likely that the soldiers that defended Pisidia in Antioch were actually living in the city or in the immediate vicinity.

On the southeast end of the village of Manarga there was recently discovered a small tunnel and researchers concluded that this tunnel was a waterway originating directly from lake Egirdir. This is a characteristic ancient Greek watertunnel known as an orygma amphistomon. There are several water-tunnels originating from lake Egirdir to several villages in the vicinity. This confirms that the village of Manarga is indeed an ancient village.

<text>El Oro (; &quot;oro&quot; = gold) is the southernmost of Ecuador&#x27;s coastal provinces. It was named for its historically important gold production. Today it is one of the world&#x27;s major exporters of bananas. The capital is Machala.

==History==

The area was settled by the Inca, who inhabited the area at the time Spanish settlement began in 1549. The Spanish found and looted gold there and mined it, carrying the gold to Spain. The province was named for its historically important gold production.

The gold was mined by Indigenous slaves captive by the Spanish mainly in the late 16th and 17th centuries in the village of Zaruma in the Zaruma Canton. In the 18th century, the earthquake of January 1749 destroyed the mining area. A local rebellion stopped the mining until the Spanish agreed to allow the native people to benefit from the mining. Spain imported gold from the area until the area gained its independence from Spain in 1820.

Philip II of Spain granted the village the title of &quot;Villa de Sant Antonio del Zerro de Oro de Zaruma&quot; (Villa Real de San Antonio del Cerro de Oro de Zaruma on October 17, 1593, as he was appreciative of the gold.

After 1820, Ecuador emerged as an independent nation, as neighboring areas to Zaruma also declared their independence. In 1882, the province of El Oro was formed by the villages of Zaruma, Machala and Santa Rosa, with Zaruma as its capital, and the area&#x27;s gold mining as the reason for the name of the province. Two years later, the capital of the province was moved to Machala. Gold mining continued under various mining companies, which now paid taxes to the government for the gold they mined.

As gold mining fell in value, El Oro province became the major area of banana production in Ecuador.

Peru invaded and occupied most of El Oro province during the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War of 1941.

==Geography==

To the north and east the province has borders with the provinces Guayas, Azuay and Loja. To the west and south it is limited by the Pacific Ocean and the Peruvian Tumbes Region.

The province is divided in 14 cantons and features a wide range of attractions, such as the Jambelí Islands, the petrified forest of the Puyango River, and the island of Santa Clara, to name a few.

==Demographics==
Around 715,751 people live in the orense territory, according to the demographic projection of the INEC for 2020, being the sixth most populated province in the country. The Province of El Oro is made up of 14 cantons, from which their respective urban and rural parishes are derived. According to the latest territorial ordinance, the province of El Oro will belong to a region also included by the provinces of Loja and Zamora Chinchipe, although it is not officially formed, called the South Region.

<text>Count Fleet (March 24, 1940 – December 3, 1973) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who is the sixth winner of the American Triple Crown. He won the Belmont Stakes by a then record margin of twenty-five lengths. After an undefeated season, he was named the 1943 Horse of the Year and champion three-year-old. Also a champion at age two, he is ranked as one of the greatest American racehorses of the twentieth century, ranking fifth on the Bloodhorse magazine&#x27;s listing. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1961.

Count Fleet started his two-year-old campaign with two losses and was originally known more for his erratic behavior than his looks or racing ability. But the colt gradually improved, eventually winning 10 of 15 starts at age two, four of them in stakes company. At distances of a mile and up, he was undefeated. In the Champagne Stakes, he set a world record for a two-year-old at a distance of a mile. He was named champion two-year-old and became the early favorite to win the Kentucky Derby.

As a three-year-old, Count Fleet dominated North American racing, never losing a race. Leading up to the Kentucky Derby, he won the important Wood Memorial but injured himself in the process. He recovered to take the Derby, the United States&#x27; most prestigious race, by three lengths, then went on to Baltimore, Maryland, where he dominated the Preakness Stakes, taking that one by eight lengths. He won the Withers Stakes before heading to Elmont, New York for the Belmont Stakes where he captured the Triple Crown by scoring a 25-length victory, a margin that stood as the record until surpassed by Secretariat in 1973. When the season ended, Count Fleet was voted Champion Three Year Old and named American Horse of the Year.

Count Fleet was also a great success as a sire and broodmare sire, leading the North American lists in 1951 and 1963 respectively. He sired Kentucky Derby winner Count Turf and Belmont Stakes winners Counterpoint and One Count. He was the broodmare sire of five-time Horse of the Year Kelso, and sired the second dam of the influential sire Mr. Prospector. He died of natural causes in 1973 at the advanced age of 33 years as the longest lived Kentucky Derby winner ever.

==Background==
Count Fleet was foaled at Stoner Creek Stud farm in Paris, Kentucky in 1940. He was bred and owned by Fannie Hertz, the wife of John D. Hertz of rental car company fame. Hertz became involved in horse racing in the 1920s and purchased eventual Kentucky Derby winner Reigh Count as a two-year-old in 1927. Reigh Count became a moderately successful sire, but his offspring were known more for stamina than speed and tended to develop late. Rather than pension the now unpopular stallion, Hertz decided to breed Reigh Count to only four mares a year, focusing on speed-oriented mares to balance the stamina influence of Reigh Count. One of these mares was the aptly named Quickly (by Haste), who had won 32 races from 85 starts, all of them at distances of six furlongs or less. Quickly&#x27;s first foal with Reigh Count, a filly named Reigh Fleet, was unplaced in seven starts. Quickly was barren the next year, then produced Count Fleet in 1940.

Count Fleet was not a particularly attractive horse, called &quot;narrow, light-waisted, and flat-muscled&quot; by one expert and too leggy and light boned by others. He also had an unruly temperament. John Hertz initially did not think much of Count Fleet and contemplated selling him until jockey Johnny Longden convinced him to keep the colt. Count Fleet was trained by Don Cameron and ridden by future Hall of Fame inductee Longden.

==Racing record==
===1942: two-year-old season===
As a two-year-old Count Fleet started off slowly, finishing second in his first two starts while racing erratically. On June 19, 1942, though, he gained attention when he won a maiden race at Aqueduct Park by four lengths, despite having run out around the turn and losing many lengths to the field. On July 4, he entered the Army and Navy purse at Empire City Race Track, part of a special program of racing to benefit the war effort, and won by six lengths. He then finished second in the East View Stakes to Gold Shower, before rebounding to win the Wakefield Stakes by four lengths with Gold Shower in third.

He then traveled to Chicago where he won an allowance race on August 11 at Washington Park. On August 15, he finished second by a neck to the highly regarded Occupation in the rich Washington Park Futurity.

Although Occupation was now considered the front-runner for the two-year-old championship, Count Fleet kept his name in consideration with a win in the Mars Purse at Aqueduct on September 15. Going off at odds of 7:10, Count Fleet was pinched at the start, was then bumped by another horse and ran into traffic problems in the turn, but finally got free and closed strongly to win by a head. He and Occupation were next scheduled to meet in the Cowdin Stakes on September 19 but Count Fleet was scratched, presumably due to a sloppy track. Instead, he made his next start on September 24 in The Morello at Belmont Park, where he &quot;conveyed the impression that he was out for a breeze, and merely beating the others as an incidental manner.&quot; He finally met up with Occupation again in the Belmont Futurity on October 3 in what was then the world&#x27;s richest race for two-year-olds. Occupation won by five lengths with Count Fleet finishing third after grabbing his quarter (a situation where one of the hind legs cuts into the hoof of one of the front legs). Count Fleet could not be pulled up after the race and eventually circled the mile-and-a-half track.

On October 10, Count Fleet was entered in the Champagne Stakes, racing for the first time at a distance of a mile. In Occupation&#x27;s absence, Count Fleet was made the even money favorite. He broke well and, in a change from his normal tactics, went to the early lead. Establishing a two-length lead down the backstretch, he rebuffed a challenge by Slide Rule around the turn and then continued to draw away down the stretch. His final winning margin was six lengths over Blue Swords with Attendant eight more lengths back in third. Count Fleet&#x27;s time of 1:34 was not only a new track record, it was also a world record for the fastest mile ever run by a two-year-old.

Count Fleet followed this up with a six-length win in the Thunderclap Purse on October 20 at odds of 1:4. On October 31, he again faced off with Occupation in the Pimlico Futurity in what essentially became a match race. Occupation took the early lead but Count Fleet moved up on the outside and the two matched strides down the backstretch and into the final turn. Rounding into the stretch, Count Fleet started to draw away and eventually won by six lengths. His time of 1:43 for miles equaled the track record and broke the existing stakes record by over a second.

Count Fleet finished his two-year-old campaign on November 10 in the Walden Stakes at Pimlico. Going off as the 1-10 favorite, he ran away from the field and won by twenty lengths (other sources have the margin of victory as 30 lengths.) At season&#x27;s end, he had won 10 of his 15 races while never being out of the money, a performance that earned him the two-year-old championship honors. He was assigned on the 1942 Experimental Free Handicap, the highest impost ever.

===1943: three-year-old season===

Because of the intensifying war effort, horse racing suffered many cutbacks starting in January 1943, including transportation restrictions and a shutdown of the Florida racing circuit. As a result, Count Fleet spent the winter at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, then was shipped to Belmont Park, arriving on March 19. In early April, he kicked himself in a morning workout but shrugged off the injury with a strong workout on the following day, completing miles in 1:55 despite being eased in the final eighth of a mile.

Count Fleet made his first start of the year on April 13 in the St James Purse over a sloppy track at Aqueduct. Going off at odds of 3:20, Count Fleet rated behind the early pace set by Bossuet, then started his move on the final turn to win by four lengths. Count Fleet was injured in the left foreleg during the race, but although the skin was broken he recovered quickly.

On April 17, Count Fleet returned in the Wood Memorial Stakes, going off as the 1-4 favorite. He was again injured, this time suffering a three-inch slice along the coronet band of a hoof, possibly caused when he was bumped at the start but more likely by a strike from one of his other legs as he started to accelerate. Count Fleet quickly entered into a duel with Blue Swords for the early lead, then was sent to the front on the first turn. He opened up a four length lead down the backstretch, then continued &quot;serenely on his way&quot; to victory.

After the race, the torn portion and part of the left hind hoof were removed, then the wound was packed with sulfa drugs. Fortunately, the wound did not become infected so Count Fleet was shipped on April 19 to Churchill Downs, which had to be done so soon after the Wood Memorial due to extensive travel restrictions.

====Triple Crown====
The 1943 Kentucky Derby was almost not run because of wartime restrictions, but Colonel Matt Winn organized it as a &quot;street-car Derby&quot; – restricting travel for out-of-state residents and not allowing cars be driven to the event. Despite this, some 60,000 people attended the race and made Count Fleet the 2-5 favorite – the shortest starting price in Derby history. Ocean Wave, who would have been the second betting choice after winning the Blue Grass Stakes and Derby Trial, was scratched hours before the race. Count Fleet broke well and challenged Gold Shower, Burnt Shower and Blue Swords for the early lead. After a quarter mile, Count Fleet found himself boxed by the other horses but broke free moving into the first turn. He then moved up to challenge Gold Shower for the lead on the first turn and opened up a two-length lead down the backstretch. On the far turn, Blue Swords mounted a challenge and closed to within a length. Longden then clucked to Count Fleet, who quickly opened a three-length advantage and won handily.

&quot;I never was afraid of Ocean Wave or any of the others in that field&quot;, said Longden. &quot;I don&#x27;t know the great horses like Man o&#x27; War because I wasn&#x27;t around then. But the Count is the greatest I&#x27;ve ever ridden. Got everything, speed, heart – just everything.&quot;

Count Fleet again injured himself, this time in the left fore, but the injury was not serious. He shipped to Baltimore for the Preakness Stakes on May 8, going off as the 3-20 favorite in a four horse field. New Moon broke fastest but Count Fleet quickly took the lead and coasted to an eight length victory. His time was 1:57 for the distance of miles over a track labeled as good, with the horses racing in the center of the track well away from the rail.

Count Fleet next entered the Withers Stakes at Belmont Park on May 22, cutting back in distance to a mile. Against only two rivals, he was made the 1-20 favorite. He seized the early lead and was never challenged while winning by eight lengths. His time of 1:36 over a slow track was the fastest mile of the meeting, despite the fact that Count Fleet raced more than 40 feet off the rail around the turn.
On June 5, Count Fleet completed the Triple Crown by winning the Belmont Stakes by 25 lengths (listed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as 30 lengths). Going off at odds of 1:20 (the legal minimum) in a three-horse field, he led from start to finish. Despite the lack of competition, his time of 2:28 broke War Admiral&#x27;s stakes record by two-fifths of a second. This time stood as the stakes record (though tied by Citation in 1948) until broken by Gallant Man in 1957. His margin of victory was also a record until broken by Secretariat in 1973, who won by 31 lengths.

After the race, his silks were auctioned for $50,000 in war bonds.

At the time, his sweep of the Triple Crown was considered &quot;commonplace&quot; as it had been done six times since Sir Barton in 1919. However, the victory earned Count Fleet favorable comparisons with Man o&#x27; War.

Once again, Count Fleet injured himself, this time by striking his left fore ankle early in the race. The ankle was X-rayed, indicating a slight wrench. Although it was believed that Count Fleet would soon return to racing, John Hertz released a statement in August that Count Fleet had subsequently developed a splint in his right foreleg that laid him up for two months. This effectively ended his three-year-old campaign, since it would take a further two months to get him back into racing shape. &quot;We like him too well,&quot; said Hertz, &quot;and we like racing and breeding too well, to attempt to force the training of this kind of horse and possibly start him in anything but his top condition.&quot;

With a record of six wins from six starts, Count Fleet was named the American Horse of the Year and champion three-year-old of 1943.

==Stud record==
Count Fleet was originally expected to race at age four but kept re-injuring himself before he was able to do so. He was officially retired to stud in July 1944 having won 16 of 21 races and went on to enjoy great success as a sire. From 434 named foals, he sired 267 winners and 39 stakes winners. Himself the son of Derby winner Reigh Count, he went on to sire another Derby winner, Count Turf. Only one other such three-generation sequence of Derby winners exists: Pensive, Ponder and Needles. Other major winners by Count Fleet include Belmont Stakes champions Counterpoint and One Count, and champion filly Kiss Me Kate. He was the leading sire in North America of 1951.

Count Fleet was an outstanding broodmare sire, leading the broodmare sire list in 1963 and runner-up in 1960 and 1961. His daughters produced Kelso, 1965 Kentucky Derby winner Lucky Debonair, the Canadian star filly Ice Water, and multiple stakes winners Tompion, Lamb Chop and Quill. Another daughter, Sequence, mated with 1955 Preakness and Belmont winner Nashua to produce &quot;Gold Digger&quot;, dam of the highly influential sire Mr. Prospector. His daughter Virginia Water was mated with Princequillo to produce Milan Mill, the dam of Mill Reef. Although Count Fleet&#x27;s sire line is now extinct, he is still an important influence in modern pedigrees through his daughters. For example, he appears twice in the pedigree of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.

==Death and longevity==
After failing to stand for two days due to old age infirmities and lameness, Count Fleet died on December 3, 1973, of an apparent blood clot and was buried at Stoner Creek farm in Paris, Kentucky. At the time of his death, he had become the longest-lived winner of all three triple crown races according to the foaling and death records that are available. Additionally, he had outlived many of his own offspring. More than forty years later, he remains the longest-lived Kentucky Derby winner ever, as well as the longest-lived Preakness Stakes winner ever. Four days short of fourteen years after the day of his death, Gallant Man surpassed him as the longest-lived Belmont Stakes winner and the longest-lived winner of any Triple Crown race.

==Honors==
In 1961, Count Fleet was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Count Fleet was ranked #5. His performance in the Belmont Stakes was ranked #33 in &quot;Horse Racing&#x27;s Top 100 Moments&quot;, a book published by The Blood-Horse in 2006 of racing in the 20th century.

Two races were named in his honor: the Count Fleet Stakes at Belmont and then Aqueduct (last run in 2012) and the Count Fleet Sprint Handicap at Oaklawn Park.

<text>In mathematics, algebraic &quot;L&quot;-theory is the &quot;K&quot;-theory of quadratic forms; the term was coined by C. T. C. Wall, 
with &quot;L&quot; being used as the letter after &quot;K&quot;. Algebraic &quot;L&quot;-theory, also known as &quot;Hermitian &quot;K&quot;-theory&quot;,
is important in surgery theory.

==Definition==
One can define &quot;L&quot;-groups for any ring with involution &quot;R&quot;: the quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups formula_1 (Wall) and the symmetric &quot;L&quot;-groups formula_2 (Mishchenko, Ranicki).

=== Even dimension ===
The even-dimensional &quot;L&quot;-groups formula_3 are defined as the Witt groups of ε-quadratic forms over the ring &quot;R&quot; with formula_4. More precisely, 

::formula_3 

is the abelian group of equivalence classes formula_6 of non-degenerate ε-quadratic forms formula_7 over R, where the underlying R-modules F are finitely generated free. The equivalence relation is given by stabilization with respect to hyperbolic ε-quadratic forms: 

:formula_8.

The addition in formula_3 is defined by 

:formula_10

The zero element is represented by formula_11 for any formula_12. The inverse of formula_6 is formula_14.

=== Odd dimension ===
Defining odd-dimensional &quot;L&quot;-groups is more complicated; further details and the definition of the odd-dimensional &quot;L&quot;-groups can be found in the references mentioned below.

==Examples and applications==
The &quot;L&quot;-groups of a group formula_15 are the &quot;L&quot;-groups formula_16 of the group ring formula_17. In the applications to topology formula_15 is the fundamental group
formula_19 of a space formula_20. The quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups formula_16
play a central role in the surgery classification of the homotopy types of formula_22-dimensional manifolds of dimension formula_23, and in the formulation of the Novikov conjecture.

The distinction between symmetric &quot;L&quot;-groups and quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups, indicated by upper and lower indices, reflects the usage in group homology and cohomology. The group cohomology formula_24 of the cyclic group formula_25 deals with the fixed points of a formula_25-action, while the group homology formula_27 deals with the orbits of a formula_25-action; compare formula_29 (fixed points) and formula_30 (orbits, quotient) for upper/lower index notation.

The quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups: formula_31 and the symmetric &quot;L&quot;-groups: formula_32 are related by 
a symmetrization map formula_33 which is an isomorphism modulo 2-torsion, and which corresponds to the polarization identities.

The quadratic and the symmetric &quot;L&quot;-groups are 4-fold periodic (the comment of Ranicki, page 12, on the non-periodicity of the symmetric &quot;L&quot;-groups refers to another type of &quot;L&quot;-groups, defined using &quot;short complexes&quot;).

In view of the applications to the classification of manifolds there are extensive calculations of
the quadratic formula_34-groups formula_16. For finite formula_15
algebraic methods are used, and mostly geometric methods (e.g. controlled topology) are used for infinite formula_15. 

More generally, one can define &quot;L&quot;-groups for any additive category with a &quot;chain duality&quot;, as in Ranicki (section 1).

=== Integers ===
The simply connected &quot;L&quot;-groups are also the &quot;L&quot;-groups of the integers, as
formula_38 for both formula_34 = formula_40 or formula_41 For quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups, these are the surgery obstructions to simply connected surgery.

The quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups of the integers are:
:formula_42
In doubly even dimension (4&quot;k&quot;), the quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups detect the signature; in singly even dimension (4&quot;k&quot;+2), the &quot;L&quot;-groups detect the Arf invariant (topologically the Kervaire invariant).

The symmetric &quot;L&quot;-groups of the integers are:
:formula_43
In doubly even dimension (4&quot;k&quot;), the symmetric &quot;L&quot;-groups, as with the quadratic &quot;L&quot;-groups, detect the signature; in dimension (4&quot;k&quot;+1), the &quot;L&quot;-groups detect the de Rham invariant.

<text>The Braničevo District (, ; ) is one of nine administrative districts of Southern and Eastern Serbia. According to the 2022 census results, it has a population of 156,367 inhabitants. The administrative center of the district is Požarevac.

It is named after the village of Braničevo.

==History==

In the 9th century, a Slavic tribe known as Braničevci are mentioned living in the region. In this time, the town named Braničevo also existed in the area, at the estuary of the river Mlava into Danube. In the Early Middle Ages, Braničevo became a part of the First Bulgarian Empire. After the conquest of Bulgaria, the Byzantines established the Theme of Sirmium in the wider region south of the river Danube.

By the 12th century, Braničevo was the centre of a Byzantine &quot;doukaton&quot; (duchy) governed by a &quot;doux&quot; (duke). The region saw significant fighting between the Byzantines and Hungarians. With the rise of the Second Bulgarian Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia, Byzantium&#x27;s position in Braničevo became untenable. It appears to have finally slipped from their control in 1198. It was a frequent object of contention between the Bulgars, Serbs and Hungarians thereafter.

In the 13th century the Hungarians established the Banate of Braničevo (Hungarian: Barancsi Bánság), but later in the century two local Bulgarian rulers, Darman and Kudelin, became independent and ruled over Braničevo and Kučevo. In 1291, they were defeated by the Serbian king, Stefan Dragutin, who joined Braničevo to his Syrmian Kingdom. Under his rule the town of Braničevo became a seat of the Eparchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The region later belonged to subsequent Serbian states, until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century. In the 14th century, the region was in a possession of local rulers from the House of Rastislalić. During the Ottoman rule, Braničevo was part of the Sanjak of Smederevo, and since 19th century, it is again part of the Serbian state.

==Culture==
In the mid-nineteenth century, at the time of the Serbian state emancipation, Požarevac became, along with Kragujevac, the second metropolis of Prince Miloš Obrenović. During his lifetime, Prince Miloš Obrenović had erected monuments to his memory in Požarevac: 
*the church in 1819
*palace (1825)
*new marketplace (1827)
*stud-farm - Ljubicevo in 1860.

Some of the places of cultural importance in Požarevac are:
*the National Museum (the first built after Belgrade)
*the Tulba Ethnic Park (a unique outdoor museum)
*Gallery of Paintings of Milena Pavlović-Barili (a distinguished surrealistic artist and poet).

==Municipalities==
The district encompasses the municipalities of:

* Veliko Gradište
* Požarevac
* Golubac
* Malo Crniće
* Žabari
* Petrovac
* Kučevo
* Žagubica

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census results, the Braničevo District has a population of 183,625 inhabitants.

<text>Jenny Gear (born April 23, 1982) is a Canadian singer and former Canadian Idol contestant.

==On Canadian Idol==
Gear auditioned for Season One of Canadian Idol in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador in 2003, bringing the panel of judges (which included Jake Gold, Sass Jordan, Farley Flex and Zach Werner) to tears with her rendition of &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;.

She next completed the Toronto rounds and earned herself a spot in the semi-finals. There, she performed &quot;Tower Of Song&quot; by Leonard Cohen and received mixed reviews from the judges. Some of the judges&#x27; comments include &quot;In true Newfoundland style I can&#x27;t help but feel that you are slightly a fish out of water in all of this,&quot; from Zach Werner and &quot;When I get a sense you&#x27;re enjoying yourself, I enjoy myself. And that&#x27;s all it boils down to,&quot; from Farley Flex. The next night, she garnered enough votes to earn herself the fifth seat in the Top 11.

On August 4, the Top 11 performed Canadian hits. Gear excelled with her version of Sarah McLachlan&#x27;s &quot;Possession&quot;, showing off her incredible range and pitch-perfect control, and after all the voting, was safe from elimination. Some of the judges&#x27; comments include &quot;You do put the Canadian in Canadian Idol,&quot; from Zach Werner and &quot;It never fails to amaze me the amount of control you have when you&#x27;re singing. This unbelievably emotional stuff,&quot; from Sass Jordan.

The next theme, Motown, proved to be a challenge for Gear. She sang &quot;Sir Duke&quot; by Stevie Wonder and although she received mediocre comments from the judges, she was safe and without a trip to the bottom three. Some of the judges&#x27; comments include &quot;This girl can really sing,&quot; from Zach Werner and &quot;You get up there and you just have this vibe about you, and you be Jenny. You can&#x27;t judge Jenny Gear. It&#x27;s just impossible,&quot; from Jake Gold.

For the Top 6, Jenny performed an amazing rendition of &quot;Summertime&quot; and remained safe from elimination. Some of the judges&#x27; comments include &quot;Jenny, that was a really beautiful interpretation,&quot; from Sass Jordan and &quot;Jenny I gotta say, I feel vindicated. You&#x27;ve just shown Canada what we first saw in St. John&#x27;s. That was riveting,&quot; from Farley Flex.

The next theme night was Elton John and Jenny chose to sing &quot;Rocket Man.&quot; Her performance earned her a mediocre response from the judges with comments that included &quot;With the song selection and the arrangement and how level your performance was it was sort of like the words you don&#x27;t want to hear your surgeon say... whoops,&quot; from Zach Werner and &quot;I think you took a song that&#x27;s extremely hard to sing and you did a damn fine job,&quot; from Sass Jordan. The next night, she had her first and last trip to the bottom two along with eventual Canadian Idol winner Ryan Malcolm. When the results were announced the crowd was shocked to find Jenny eliminated.

===Post-&quot;Idol&quot;===
After the show, Idol judge Jake Gold signed Gear to his talent agency, but they eventually parted ways due to creative differences.

Jenny Gear&#x27;s debut album &quot;Jenny Gear and The Whiskey Kittens&quot;, which was recorded entirely in her grandmother&#x27;s kitchen, was actually recorded before she appeared on Idol. The CD was released in late 2004 and has been the top seller on Atlantic Music Online for the last two and a half years.

She has appeared on many TV shows including &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;, &quot;MuchMusic&#x27;s Going Coastal&quot;, &quot;Live at 5&quot;, and &quot;Out of the Fog&quot;.&quot; She also appeared in her own special on CBC in 2004 before the release of her album.
Jenny Gear is currently playing clubs around the St. John&#x27;s area and working on her 2nd CD.

==Jenny Gear and The Whiskey Kittens==
Jenny Gear and The Whiskey Kittens, the band on Jenny&#x27;s first CD, are no longer performing together.
Most of the members are now pursuing solo careers. Accompanying Jenny at most of her gigs lately is the well known St. John&#x27;s guitarist Sandy Morris.

===Singles===

==Trivia==
* Jenny Gear appears in the Great Big Sea video for &quot;Captain Kidd&quot; from &quot;The Hard and the Easy&quot; album.

<text>Sheldon Vanauken (; August 4, 1914October 18, 1996) was an American author, best known for his autobiographical book &quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; (1977), which recounts his and his wife&#x27;s friendship with C. S. Lewis, their conversion to Christianity, and dealing with tragedy. He published a sequel in 1985 titled &quot;Under the Mercy&quot;.

==Early life==
Vanauken was born Sheldon Frank Van Auken in Auburn, Indiana, the elder of two sons of a wealthy attorney, (Robert) Glenn Vanauken, and his wife Grace Merle (Hanselman) Vanauken. His parents were of German and Dutch descent, their grandparents having migrated to Indiana from eastern Pennsylvania and Columbiana County, Ohio. Vanauken was named for his two grandfathers, Frank Vanauken, a teacher, and Sheldon Fitch Hanselman, an attorney. His father was a self-made lawyer who became influential in local politics, served as a state senator, and owned the Indiana Broadcasting Company.

Vanauken grew up at the family home, &quot;Glenmerle&quot;, (a composite of his parents&#x27; middle names) located on the south side of Carmel, Indiana; He attended Culver Military Academy, Staunton Military Academy and, for one year, Miami Military Academy in Florida. He earned his undergraduate degree from Wabash College in 1938, where he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, and later attended Yale and Oxford Universities. He was interested in flying, and had his own small plane at Wabash which his father bought for him.

While at college, he dropped the &quot;Frank&quot; from his name. In later life, he was known to friends simply as &quot;Van&quot;.

==Marriage and religious conversion==
Van met Jean &quot;Davy&quot; Palmer Davis during his junior year at Wabash. She was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, on July 24, 1914, the daughter of Reverend Staley Franklin Davis (1877–1926), a prominent Methodist minister, and his wife Helen Larter (Fredericks) Davis (1885–1950), a teacher. Staley Davis was a native of Pataskala, Ohio, and Helen Davis of Newark, NJ. Davy&#x27;s sister Helen Marjorie (1908–1991) was six years older and her brother Donald three years younger.

When Davy was fourteen years old, two years after her father&#x27;s death, she became pregnant by an unknown man. She gave up the baby girl, whom she called Marion, for adoption but never forgot her.

Davy had been educated at Troy Conference Academy, a Vermont boarding school, but had to withdraw due to lack of funds after her father&#x27;s death. After finishing school, she worked in New York City for a time before moving to Indianapolis to enter Butler University. Shortly after beginning her studies there, she met Sheldon Vanauken at the Indianapolis department store where she worked hand-tinting photographs to earn her tuition.

Van and Davy soon fell deeply in love and made a vow they called the &quot;Shining Barrier&quot;. In brief, they promised to share everything in life, including all their interests, friends, and work, in order to tie themselves so closely together that nothing could ever separate them. Their devotion to this idea was so complete that they decided never to have children, as they felt that motherhood would be an experience which could not be shared equally. Both were agnostics at this time.

They were married secretly (due, according to &quot;A Severe Mercy&quot;, to Van&#x27;s father&#x27;s objection to early marriages) on October 1, 1937, ten months after they met. They apparently kept their secret for some years, as they are both listed as &quot;single&quot; in the 1940 census, and are living apart—Van with his parents in DeKalb County, and Davy in a boarding house in Indianapolis, where she is listed as working as a bank teller.

The couple announced their marriage to Van&#x27;s family in the winter of 1940. Shortly after, Van was called up for naval duty and stationed at Pearl Harbor. Davy joined him there some months later and took a job working with the navy. Van&#x27;s father died suddenly on July 31, 1943 during World War II. Vanauken inherited a substantial amount of money and used some of it to have a boat built which they named &quot;Grey Goose&quot;, for the bird which remains true to one mate throughout life. Following Van&#x27;s studies in history at Yale, from which he received a master&#x27;s degree in 1948, and a stint in the Navy stationed in Hawaii, the young couple spent considerable time sailing &quot;Grey Goose&quot; around Chesapeake Bay, the Florida Keys, and the Caribbean.

In 1948, Vanauken took a teaching position at Lynchburg College. However, when postwar travel to Europe became possible again, he took a sabbatical and he and Davy moved to England so that he could study at Oxford University (where he was awarded a BLitt in 1957). While they were there, they became friends with a circle of young Christian students. Eventually, Davy &quot;crossed the room&quot; to become a devout Anglican Christian herself; she had reexamined her life and views on the nature of sin after a thwarted attempt by a stranger to assault her. Her conversion was also partly owing to the friendship and influence of C. S. Lewis, who was teaching at Oxford at the time. In the spirit of the &quot;Shining Barrier&quot;, Van followed her, but with less conviction and even with some resentment.

Upon their return to Lynchburg, Van continued teaching history and literature at Lynchburg College. They joined a local congregation and explored their faith further. It was eventually to be tested severely. Davy contracted a virus which attacked her liver, possibly picked up during their years of travel. At the time of her diagnosis in the summer of 1954, Vanauken had just resigned to accept a job offer from his alma mater, Wabash College, but asked Lynchburg to rehire him in order to stay near Davy&#x27;s doctors, which they did. Davy died of her illness soon after, at Virginia Baptist Hospital in Lynchburg on January 17, 1955. She was 40 years old, and they had been married for over seventeen years.

A great part of &quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; concerns how Van came to grips with losing his beloved wife with the help of his increasing faith and his correspondence with Lewis, who soon was to face the loss of his own terminally ill wife. Vanauken later called the &quot;Shining Barrier&quot; he and Davy had created a &quot;pagan love, invaded by Christ.&quot; He never remarried, and eventually converted to Roman Catholicism in 1981.

&quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; won a National Book Award in the one-year category Religion/Inspiration.

==Later life==
Many years after Davy&#x27;s death, Vanauken went looking for the daughter Davy had given up for adoption as a young girl. The story of his search, their 1988 meeting, and how it affected his beliefs is related in &quot;The Little Lost Marion and Other Mercies&quot;, which was written shortly before his death. &quot;Marion&quot;, who had been given another name by her adoptive parents, had become a nurse and had three children with her husband, a physician.

Van continued to teach at Lynchburg College to the end of his career. In the 1960s, he was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War and a supporter of the feminist movement, although he eventually abandoned the latter in the belief that it had become too radical. The Oxford English Dictionary credits him as one of the earliest users of the word &quot;sexist&quot;, in the pamphlet &quot;Freedom for Movement Girls Now&quot;, published by the Southern Student Organizing Committee (a progressive student organization in the southern United States), wherein he was active during the 1960s. He is sometimes falsely claimed to have coined the word &quot;sexism,&quot; but in fact it was most likely coined by Pauline M. Leet, and first appeared in print in Caroline Bird&#x27;s speech &quot;On Being Born Female&quot;, which was published on November 15, 1968 in &quot;Vital Speeches of the Day.&quot;
He was also a candidate for public office on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket in Virginia.

After his conversion to Catholicism, he was a contributing editor of the &quot;New Oxford Review&quot; and a frequent contributor to &quot;Crisis&quot; and &quot;Southern Partisan&quot; magazines, as well as to other periodicals and newspapers. He expressed sympathy for the Confederacy in his 1985 book, &quot;The Glittering Illusion&quot;, although he was always critical of racism and slavery.

He remained an ardent Anglophile all his life, and often used British spelling and expressions in his writing.

Sheldon Vanauken died of lung cancer on October 28, 1996. His ashes were scattered in the churchyard of St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Forest, Virginia, as those of his wife Davy had been forty years previously. Some were also scattered in a churchyard in Binsey near Oxford, where a friend, Edmund Dews, had scattered some of Davy&#x27;s ashes after her death. (Lewis&#x27; letter agreeing to scatter the ashes was lost in the mail, so Vanauken asked Edmund to do it.)

A movie version of &quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; was in development in 2013 by Origin Entertainment, who had optioned the film rights in late 2012.

<text>The Šumadija District (, ) is one of eight administrative districts of Šumadija and Western Serbia. It is located in the central parts of the country. According to the 2022 census results, it has a population of 269,728 inhabitants, and the administrative center is the city of Kragujevac. The district is named after the geographical region of Šumadija. 

==Municipalities==

The Šumadija District is divided into 6 municipalities and the city of Kragujevac. 
The municipalities of the district are:
* Aranđelovac
* Topola
* Rača
* Batočina
* Knić
* Lapovo

==Demographics==

According to the last official census done in 2011, the Šumadija District had 293,308 inhabitants. 64.9% of the population lived in urban areas. The ethnic composition of the district:
==Culture and history==
In the vicinity of Kragujevac stand several medieval monasteries, including the Annunciation monastery Divostin from the thirteenth century; the St. Nicholas monastery, believed to have existed at the time of the Battle of Kosovo in 1389; and the Drača monastery from unknown times.

In 1833 the Kragujevac Grammar School, the first Serb-language grammar school south of the Sava and Danube rivers, was founded in Kragujevac. Over the last fifty years this city of Serbian schooling has borne a symbol of grief: in the Memorial Park in Šumarice stands a monument to the pupils and teachers of this grammar school who were executed in World War II. Seeking to set a frightening example for all Serbia, German fascists executed 7,000 citizens in Kragujevac over the course of a single day, October 21, 1941. Among them were about 300 pupils and 18 teachers, including 15 boys from the ages of 8 to 15.

<doc id="696586" wikidata="Q4659427" url="?curid=696586" title="A Severe Mercy">
<text>A Severe Mercy is an autobiographical book by Sheldon Vanauken, relating the author&#x27;s relationship with his wife, their friendship with C. S. Lewis, conversion to Christianity, and subsequent tragedy. It was first published in 1977. The book is strongly influenced, at least stylistically, by the Evelyn Waugh novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Under the Mercy&quot;, first published in 1985.

The book is, in a sense, made up of two distinct parts: the first chronicles the love story of Vanauken and his wife, a love which he refers to as pagan. The couple pledged always to put their love before all else, and the intensity of their devotion to one another and their exclusivity makes up the early chapters. However, Vanauken (or &quot;Van&quot;) and his wife Jean Davis (or &quot;Davy&quot;) explore Christianity and are gradually converted, and the primacy of their love for one another comes into question for both of them—though Vanauken&#x27;s conversion is somewhat slower and more reluctant.

His analysis is aided by a correspondence with C.S. Lewis, then an Oxford Don, and some of Lewis&#x27;s letters are reprinted in the book. Vanauken&#x27;s circle of Oxford acquaintances includes other recognizable names as well, including Catholic priest Julian Stead, who went on to author books of religious poetry and a noted text on St. Benedict&#x27;s rule of life.

&quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; is undoubtedly Vanauken&#x27;s best known and most successful book. However, his first published work was a small booklet called &quot;Encounter with Light&quot;, written about 1960 and available only from Wheaton College in Illinois today. Vanauken&#x27;s only novel, Gateway to Heaven, was published by Harper &amp; Row in 1980.

A Severe Mercy won a Gold Medallion Award from the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 1977.

&quot;A Severe Mercy&quot; won a 1980 U.S. National Book Award in the one-year category Religion/Inspiration.

The 1985 sequel Under the Mercy spans many years after the death of Vanauken&#x27;s wife, years during which he first fell away from &quot;the obedience&quot; and then returned and eventually converted to Catholicism.

In May 2013, Origin Entertainment purchased the rights to begin development on the screenplay by Barbara Nicolosi (&quot;Fatima&quot; (2020)) with plans of taking the film into production in 2021 .

<text>Gateshead Football Club is a professional association football club based in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. The club competes in the , the fifth level of the English football league system, and play their home matches at the Gateshead International Stadium.

Established in 1977 after Gateshead United folded, the club are known as the &quot;Tynesiders&quot; or the &quot;Heed&quot;. There had been a Gateshead A.F.C. in the Football League from 1930 to 1960, which had folded before Gateshead United had been established. The current incarnation of the club began life in the Northern Premier League, winning Premier Division titles in the 1982–83 and 1985–86 seasons. However they were relegated from the Football Conference in 1984 and 1987. They secured promotion back to the Conference at the end of the 1989–90 season, though would remain there until another relegation in 1998. The club were further relegated from the Northern Premier League Premier Division in 2003. They won the First Division play-offs in 2004 and the Premier Division play-offs in 2008, before winning promotion from the Conference North with a second-placed finish in 2008–09. Gateshead spent the next decade in the top-flight of English football&#x27;s non-League system, losing a play-off final in 2014, before they were demoted into the National League North in 2019 due to financial irregularities. They returned to the National League after winning the National League North in 2021–22. They won their first FA Trophy title in the 2023–24 season having finished as runners-up in the previous competition.

==History==
The original Gateshead club was formed in 1899 as South Shields Adelaide and became members of the Football League in 1919. In 1930 financial problems saw the club moved to Gateshead, where they adopted the name of their new town. However, the club was voted out of the Football League in 1960 and folded in 1973. History repeated itself as the South Shields club formed to replace the original one was also moved to Gateshead, becoming Gateshead United in 1974. However, they were dissolved at the end of the 1976–77 season. A new club was established, taking over from United in the Northern Premier League. After three seasons in the bottom half of the table, they finished eleventh in 1980–81, also reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1–0 at Lincoln City. The club finished fourth in the league the following season.

The 1982–83 season saw Gateshead win the Northern Premier League with a record points tally (100), scoring 114 goals in the process. As a result, the club were promoted to the Alliance Premier League. After a sixteenth-place finish in their first season in the league, they finished second-from-bottom in 1984–85 and were relegated back to the Northern Premier League. The following season saw the club win the Northern Premier League title and the league&#x27;s Challenge Shield, earning an immediate return to the (now renamed) Football Conference. However, they lasted only one season in the Conference, and were relegated back to the Northern Premier League after finishing bottom of the table.

With the Northern Premier League having gained a second division, Gateshead became members of its Premier Division upon their return to the league. They finished eighteenth in 1987–88 and second-from-bottom the following season, but avoided relegation to Division One as no team was relegated to the league from the Conference. After this reprieve, the club were runners-up in 1989–90 and were promoted back to the Conference, as champions Colne Dynamoes were ineligible for promotion. The following seven seasons saw them in mid-table every season, but after finishing in the relegation zone in 1997–98, they returned to the Northern Premier League.

After two top-five finishes following their return, Gateshead finished in mid-table in 2000–01 and 2001–02. Although they were relegated to Division One at the end of the 2002–03 season, a sixth-place finish in 2003–04 was sufficient to secure a return to the Premier Division due to the creation of the Conference North and South leading to many clubs leaving the Premier Division. A third-place finish in the Premier Division in 2007–08 saw the club qualify for the promotion play-offs, and after defeating Eastwood Town 4–0 in the semi-finals, they beat Buxton 2–0 in the final to earn promotion to the Conference North.

In the 2008–09 season, Gateshead were Conference North runners-up. In the subsequent play-offs, they beat Southport 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, before a 1–0 win over AFC Telford United in the final saw them promoted to the Conference National. The club adopted a full-time squad for the first time for the 2010–11 season. In 2013–14, the club finished third in the league, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. They beat Grimsby Town 4–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals, setting up a Wembley final against Cambridge United, which they lost 2–1. In the following season the club reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time; wins over Norton United in the first round and Warrington Town in the second led to a third-round tie with Premier League side West Bromwich Albion, with Gateshead losing 7–0. The club were suspended from the National League in May 2019 due to financial irregularities, and were demoted to the National League North the following month.

The curtailed 2019–20 season saw Gateshead finish seventh (with the league table calculated on points-per-game), qualifying for the play-offs. However, after beating Brackley Town on penalties after a 1–1 draw in the first round, they lost 5–3 to Boston United in the semi-finals. In 2021–22 Gateshead were National League North champions, earning promotion back to the National League. The 2022–23 season saw them reach the final of the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium, where they lost 1–0 to FC Halifax Town. After finishing sixth in the National League in 2023–24, the club were barred from competing in the play-offs after failing to meet the entry criteria for the Football League due to not obtaining a &quot;10-year security of tenure&quot; for their stadium. They also reached a second successive FA Trophy final, this time defeating Solihull Moors on penalties following a 2–2 draw to win the competition.

==Colours and crest==
The club initially played in all red strip with a white and blue vertical slash on the shirt. Gateshead continued to play in odd-coloured variations until the mid-1980s, when the club changed to the colours of the previous Gateshead incarnation – white shirt, black shorts and socks – and have played in these same colours ever since. Since 2011, Gateshead has adopted their original colours of claret and blue as the club&#x27;s away strip.

The club&#x27;s crest incorporates an image of the statue the Angel of the North.

==Stadium==
The club have played at the Gateshead International Stadium since their establishment. The record attendance of 11,750 was set in a 1995 friendly match with Newcastle United.

On 28 October 2009, Gateshead unveiled plans for a new 8,000 capacity stadium to be built in the town centre, opposite the Gateshead Civic Centre, formerly the home of North Durham Cricket &amp; Rugby Club. However, after the failure of England&#x27;s bids to host the World Cup in 2018 or 2022, the stadium, which would have acted as a training base for teams playing at nearby St James&#x27; Park, was put on hold indefinitely. In 2014, it was reported that chairman Graham Wood &quot;no longer considers a new purpose-built football ground vital to the future of Gateshead Football Club&quot;. In December 2015, the club&#x27;s new owner, Richard Bennett, announced that the club had restarted the search for a new stadium location, although he described the International Stadium as &quot;fabulous&quot;. Despite Gateshead qualifying for the National League play-offs in 2023–24, they were excluded due to Gateshead Council failing to grant the club a ten-year security of tenure for the International Stadium, which is required for all teams that apply for EFL membership from the National League.

<doc id="696589" wikidata="Q222549" url="?curid=696589" title="Elachistidae">
<text>The Elachistidae (grass-miner moths) are a family of small moths in the superfamily Gelechioidea. Some authors lump about 3,300 species in eight subfamilies here, but this arrangement almost certainly results in a massively paraphyletic and completely unnatural assemblage, united merely by symplesiomorphies retained from the first gelechioid moths.

In fact, most of these moths appear to be either closer to the Oecophorinae and are hence nowadays usually included in the Oecophoridae (Depressariinae, &quot;Deuterogoniinae&quot;, Hypertrophinae, Stenomatinae and perhaps the enigmatic &quot;Aeolanthes&quot;), or constitute quite basal lineages of gelechioids, neither closely related to &quot;Elachista&quot; nor to &quot;Oecophora&quot;, and hence best treated as independent families within the Gelechioidea (Agonoxenidae, Ethmiidae). The genus &quot;Coelopoeta&quot; is sometimes still placed here, but probably belongs in the Oecophorinae.

Consequently, the Elachistidae are essentially identical to the subfamily Elachistinae in the family&#x27;s wide circumscription. The Agonoxenidae might perhaps belong here regardless, but even this is doubtful. Nonetheless, a considerable number of genera remain in the present family, and eventually it is likely that subdivisions will again be established (e.g. by raising some or all of the tribes proposed for the former Elachistinae to subfamily status).

A significant reduction of genera has been proposed, from the current mass of 20 genera to 3. The proposition was made on the premise of several distinguishing classifications, all of which are synapomorphies. Those include genital size and presence of digitate, adult abdomen segments without dorsal spines, absence of maxillary palpi and fronto-clypeal suture, and immobile abdominal segments in pupae and larvae. Various tribes were considered within the proposition, with most differentiation coming from genital structure.

In the modern, reduced description, the Elachistidae are small to very small moths (wingspans usually around 1 cm). Their wings appear feather-like due to the fine hair covering the wings&#x27; fringes, and the hindwings can be significantly reduced in area, essentially consisting of a small strip with a wide hairy fringe. The caterpillars are typically leaf miners or stem miners on Poales.

==Genera==
The genera of Elachistidae are:

*Elachistinae
**&quot;Elachista&quot;
**&quot;Eretmograptis&quot; 
**&quot;Mylocrita&quot; 
**&quot;Myrrhinitis&quot; 
**&quot;Perittia&quot; 
**&quot;Stephensia&quot; 
**&quot;Urodeta&quot; 

Several small genera colored by some authors are here included in &quot;Elachista&quot;, as it would otherwise be liable to be non-monophyletic. As noted above, &quot;Aeolanthes&quot; may also belong here, as the only genus of a subfamily Aeolanthinae. Also possibly included is the Peruvian species &quot;Auxotricha ochrogypsa&quot;, described by Edward Meyrick in 1931 as the sole member of its genus.

*Parametriotinae 
*Agonoxeninae (alternatively treated as a separate family)

===Fossil record===
Some prehistoric genera of Elachistidae, known only from fossils, have been described:
* †&quot;Elachistites&quot;

<text>The Clovis culture is an archaeological culture from the Paleoindian period of North America, spanning around 13,050 to 12,750 years Before Present (BP). The type site is Blackwater Draw locality No. 1 near Clovis, New Mexico, where stone tools were found alongside the remains of Columbian mammoths in 1929. Clovis sites have been found across North America. The most distinctive part of the Clovis culture toolkit are Clovis points, which are projectile points with a fluted, shape. Clovis points are typically large, sometimes exceeding in length. These points were multifunctional, also serving as cutting tools. Other stone tools used by the Clovis culture include knives, scrapers, and bifacial tools, with bone tools including beveled rods and shaft wrenches, with possible ivory points also being identified. Hides, wood, and natural fibers may also have been utilized, though no direct evidence of this has been preserved. Clovis artifacts are often found grouped together in caches where they had been stored for later retrieval, and over 20 Clovis caches have been identified.

The Clovis peoples are thought to have been highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers. It is generally agreed that these groups were reliant on hunting big game (megafauna), having a particularly strong association with mammoths, and to a lesser extent with mastodon, gomphothere, bison, and horse,&quot;&quot; but they also consumed smaller animals and plants. The Clovis hunters may have contributed to the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions in North America, though this idea has been subject to controversy. Only one human burial has been directly associated with tools from the Clovis culture: Anzick-1, a young boy found buried in Montana, who has a close genetic relation to some modern Native American populations, primarily in Central and South America.

The Clovis culture represents the earliest widely recognised archaeological culture in North America (though in western North America, it appears to have been contemporaneous with the Western Stemmed Tradition). While historically, many scholars held to a &quot;Clovis first&quot; model, where Clovis represented the earliest inhabitants in the Americas, today this is largely rejected, with several generally accepted sites across the Americas like Monte Verde II being dated to at least a thousand years earlier than the oldest Clovis sites.

The end of the Clovis culture may have been driven by the decline of the megafauna that the Clovis hunted as well as decreasing mobility, resulting in local differentiation of lithic and cultural traditions across North America. Beginning around 12,750–12,600 years BP, the Clovis culture was succeeded by more regional cultures, including the Folsom tradition in central North America, the Cumberland point in mid/southern North America, the Suwannee and Simpson points in the southeast, and Gainey points in the Northeast–Great Lakes region. The Clovis and Folsom traditions may have overlapped, perhaps for around 80–400 years. The end of the Clovis culture is generally thought to be the result of normal cultural change over time.

In South America, the widespread similar Fishtail or Fell point style was contemporaneous to the usage of Clovis points in North America and possibly developed from Clovis points.

==Discovery==
On August 29, 1927, the first evidence of Pleistocene humans seen by multiple archaeologists in the Americas was discovered near Folsom, New Mexico. At this site, they found the first &quot;in situ&quot; Folsom point with the bones of the extinct bison species &quot;Bison antiquus&quot;. This confirmation of a human presence in the Americas during the Pleistocene inspired many people to start looking for evidence of early humans.

In 1929, 19-year-old Ridgely Whiteman, who had been closely following the excavations in nearby Folsom in the newspapers, discovered the Clovis site near the Blackwater Draw in eastern New Mexico. Despite several earlier Paleoindian discoveries, the best documented evidence of the Clovis complex was collected and excavated between 1932 and 1937 near Clovis, New Mexico, by a crew under the direction of Edgar Billings Howard until 1935 and later by John L. Cotter from the Academy of Natural Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. Howard&#x27;s crew left their excavation in Burnet Cave, the first professionally excavated Clovis site, in August 1932, and visited Whiteman and his Blackwater Draw site. By November, Howard was back at Blackwater Draw to investigate additional finds from a construction project.

The &quot;American Journal of Archaeology&quot;, in its January–March 1932 edition, mentions Howard&#x27;s work in Burnet Cave, including the discovery of extinct fauna and a &quot;Folsom type&quot; point 4 ft below a Basketmaker burial. Reference is made to a slightly earlier article on Burnet Cave in &quot;The University Museum Bulletin&quot; from November 1931.

The Dent site in Colorado was the first known association of Clovis points with mammoth bones, as noted by Hannah Marie Wormington in her book &quot;Ancient Man in North America&quot; (4th ed. 1957). Gary Haynes, in his book &quot;The Early Settlement of North America&quot;, suggested the type of point thereafter associated with megafauna (especially mammoths) at over a dozen other archaeological sites in North America would have been more appropriately named &quot;Dent&quot; rather than Clovis, the town near Blackwater Draw that gave the type of point its name.

==Material culture==
A feature considered to be distinctive of the Clovis tradition is overshot flaking, which is defined as flakes that &quot;during the manufacture of a biface are struck from prepared edges of a piece and travel from one edge across the face&quot;, with limited removal of the opposite edge. Whether or not the overshot flaking was intentional on the part of the stoneknapper has been contested, with other authors suggesting that overface flaking (where flakes that travel past the midline but terminate before reaching the opposite end are removed) was the primary goal. Other elements considered distinctive of the Clovis culture tool complex include &quot;raw material selectivity; distinctive patterns of flake and blade platform preparation, thinning and flaking; characteristic biface size and morphology, including the presence of end-thinning; and the size, curvature and reduction strategies of blades&quot;. It has long been recognised that the definition of the Clovis culture is to a degree ambiguous, the term being &quot;used in a number of ways, referring to an era, to a culture, and most specifically, to a distinctive projectile point type&quot;, with disagreement between scholars about distinguishing between Clovis and various other Paleoindian archaeological cultures.

===Tools===
====Clovis point====
A hallmark of the toolkit associated with the Clovis culture is the distinctively shaped lithic point known as the Clovis point. Clovis points are bifacial (having flakes removed from both faces) and typically fluted (having an elongate flake removed from the base of the point) on both sides, with the fluting typically running up a third or a half of the length of the point, distinct from many later Paleoindian traditions where the flute runs up the entire point length. Clovis points are typically parallel-sided to slightly convex, with the base of the point being concave. Although no direct evidence of what was attached to Clovis points has been found, Clovis points are commonly thought to have served as tips for spears/darts likely used as handheld thrusting or throwing weapons (or possibly as ground-mounted pikes) , possibly in combination with a spear thrower, for hunting and possibly self-defense. Wear on Clovis points indicates that they were multifunctional objects that also served as cutting and slicing tools, with some authors suggesting that some Clovis-point types were primarily used as knives. Clovis points were at least sometimes resharpened, though the idea that they were continually resharpened &quot;long-life&quot; tools has been questioned. The shape and size of Clovis points varies significantly over space and time; the largest points exceed in length. The points required considerable effort to make and often broke during knapping, particularly during fluting. The fluting may have served to make the finished points more durable during use by acting as a &quot;shock absorber&quot; to redistribute stress during impact, though others have suggested that it may have been purely stylistic or used to strengthen the hafting to the spear handle. The points were generally produced from nodules or siliceous cryptocrystalline rocks. Clovis points were thinned using end-thinning (&quot;the removal of blade-like flakes parallel to the long-axis&quot;). They were initially prepared using percussion flaking, with the point being finished using pressure flaking.

====Blades====
Clovis blades—long flakes removed from specially prepared conical or wedge-shaped cores—are part of the global Upper Paleolithic blade tradition. Clovis blades are twice as long as they are wide and were used and modified to create a variety of tools, including endscrapers (used to scrape hides), serrated tools, and gravers. Unlike bifaces, Clovis blade cores do not appear to have been regularly transported over long distances, with only the blades typically carried in the mobile toolkit.

====Bifaces====
Bifaces served a variety of roles for Clovis hunter-gatherers, such as cutting tools, preforms (partially shaped precursors) for formal tools such as points, and as portable sources of large flakes useful as preforms or tools.

====Other tools====
Other tools associated with the Clovis culture are adzes (likely used for woodworking), bone &quot;shaft wrenches&quot; (suggested to have been used to straighten wooden shafts), as well as rods, some of which have beveled (diagonally shaped) ends. These rods are made of bone, antlers, and ivory. The function of the rods is unknown and has been subject to numerous hypotheses. Rods that were beveled on both ends are most often interpreted as foreshafts to which stone points were hafted, with a pair of rods surrounding each side of the point (or alternatively, the point being surrounded by a single beveled rod and the end of the wooden shaft,) while rods that are beveled on only one end, with the other being pointed, are most often interpreted as projectile points. The rods may have served other purposes, such as prybars. Clovis people are also known to have used ivory and bone to create projectile points.

===Caches===
A distinctive feature of the Clovis culture generally not found in subsequent cultures is &quot;caching&quot;, where a collection of artifacts (typically stone tools, such as Clovis points or bifaces) were deliberately left at a location, presumably with the intention to return to collect them later, though some authors have interpreted cache deposits as ritual behavior. Over twenty such &quot;caches&quot; have been identified across North America.

==Art and ritual practices==
A few Clovis culture artifacts are suspected to reflect creative expression, such as rock art, the use of red ocher, and engraved stones. The best-known examples of this were found at the Gault site in Texas and consist of limestone nodules incised with expressive geometric patterns, some of which mimic leaf patterns. Clovis peoples, like other Paleoindian cultures, used red ocher for a variety of artistic and ritual purposes, including burials, and to cover objects in caches. Clovis peoples are known to have transported ocher from its original outcrop. They are also suggested to have produced beads out of animal bones.

==Lifestyle==
Clovis hunter-gatherers are characterized as &quot;high-technology foragers&quot; who utilized sophisticated technology to maintain access to resources under conditions of high mobility. In many Clovis localities, the stone tools found at a site were hundreds of kilometers away from the source stone outcrop, in one case over away. The people who produced the Clovis culture probably had a low population density but with geographically extensive cultural networks. The Clovis culture is suggested to have heavily utilized hides, wood, and natural fibres, though no direct evidence of this has been preserved. Bone needles, likely used to stitch clothes from fur, have been found at the Clovis-associated La Prele site in Wyoming. They were made of jackrabbit, red fox, and feline (suggested to be either bobcat, Canada lynx, cougar, or American cheetah) bone, suggesting that these species were likely exploited for their pelts. Clovis artifacts have often been found associated with big game, including proboscideans (Columbian mammoth, mastodon, and the gomphothere &quot;Cuvieronius&quot;) bison, and equines of the genus &quot;Equus.&quot; A handful of sites possibly suggest the hunting of caribou/reindeer, peccaries (&quot;Platygonus&quot;, &quot;Mylohyus&quot;), ground sloths (&quot;Paramylodon&quot;), glyptodonts (&quot;Glyptotherium&quot;), tapirs, the camel &quot;Camelops&quot;, and the llama &quot;Hemiauchenia&quot;. Proboscideans (predominantly mammoths) are the most common recorded species found in Clovis sites, followed by bison. However, the Clovis culture is not exclusively associated with large animals, with several sites showing the exploitation of small game like tortoises, with lagomorphs, predominantly jackrabbits, being found at around 31% of all Clovis sites. It is generally agreed that the people who produced the Clovis culture were reliant on big game for a significant portion of their diet, while also consuming smaller animals and plants, though some authors have argued for a generalist hunter-gatherer lifestyle that also involved the occasional targeting of megafauna. Plant remains at Clovis sites (which are almost exclusively from eastern North America) primarily consist of food that can be easily gathered, such as fruit that required little processing, with little evidence of plant processing tools being found. The effectiveness of Clovis tools for hunting proboscideans has been contested by some authors, though others have asserted that Clovis points were likely capable of killing proboscideans, noting that replica Clovis points have been able to penetrate elephant hide in experimental tests, and that groups of hunter-gatherers in Africa have been observed killing elephants using spears. Isotopic analysis of the only known Clovis burial, the young child Anzick-1 from Montana, suggests that mammoths made up a large proportion (~35–40%) of the total diet of his group, with major contributions also coming from elk and probably bison, with small animals only making up a small proportion (~4%) of the diet.

In the Southern Plains, Clovis people created campsites of considerable size, which are often on the periphery of the region near sources of workable stone, from which they are suggested to have seasonally migrated into the plains to hunt megafauna. In the southeast, Clovis peoples created large camps that may have served as &quot;staging areas&quot;, which may have been seasonally occupied, where a number of bands may have gathered for social occasions. At Jake Bluff in northern Oklahoma, Clovis points are associated with numerous butchered &quot;Bison antiquus&quot; bones, which represented a bison herd of at least 22 individuals. At the time of deposition, the site was a steep-sided arroyo (dry watercourse) that formed a dead end, suggesting that hunters trapped the bison herd within the arroyo before killing them.

===Megafauna extinction===
Beginning in the 1950s, Paul S. Martin proposed the &quot;overkill hypothesis&quot;, suggesting that the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions in North America were driven by human hunting, including by Clovis peoples, with the hunting and extinction of large herbivores having a knock-on effect causing the extinction of large carnivores. This suggestion has been the subject of controversy. The timing of megafauna extinction in North America also coincides with major climatic changes, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of various factors. In a 2012 survey of archaeologists in &quot;The SAA Archaeological Record&quot;, 63% of respondents said that megafauna extinctions were likely the result of a &quot;combination of factors&quot;.

==Genetics==
The only known Clovis burial is that of Anzick-1, an infant boy who was found near Wilsall, Montana, in 1968. The body was associated with over 100 stone and bone artifacts, all of which were stained with red ocher, and it dates to approximately 12,990–12,840 years BP. Sequencing of his genome demonstrates that he belonged to a population that is ancestral to many contemporary Indigenous peoples of the Americas, particularly those from Central and South America, and less related to those from contemporary North America, including northern Mexico, though there is considerable variability in the genetic closeness of Central and South American indigenous peoples to Anzick-1, with older ancient South American remains generally being closer, suggesting that the Native American population had already diverged into multiple genetically distinct groups by the time of the Clovis culture, followed by subsequent migration of these populations later in the Holocene. Like other Native Americans, Anzick-1 is closely related to Siberian peoples, confirming the Asian origin of the Clovis culture. He belongs to Y chromosome Haplogroup Q-L54, which is common among contemporary Native Americans, and to mitochondrial haplogroup D4h3a, which is rare among contemporary Native Americans (occurring in only 1.4%, primarily along the Pacific coast) but more common in the very earliest Indigenous Americans.

==Distribution and chronology==
Some authors have suggested that the Clovis culture lasted for a relatively short period of a few centuries, with a 2020 study suggesting a temporal range, based on ten securely radiocarbon-dated Clovis sites, of 13,050 to 12,750 calibrated years BP, ending subsequent to the onset of the Younger Dryas, consistent with the results obtained in a 2007 study by the same authors. Other authors have argued that some sites extend the range of the Clovis culture back to 13,500 years BP, though the dating for these earlier sites is not secure. Some scholars have supported a long chronology for Clovis of around 1,500 years.

Historically, many authors argued for a &quot;Clovis first&quot; paradigm, where Clovis, which represents the earliest recognisable archaeological culture in North America, were suggested to represent the earliest inhabitants of the Americas south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. However, since the beginning of the 21st century, this hypothesis has been abandoned by most researchers, as several widely accepted sites, notably Monte Verde II in Chile (c. 14,500 years BP) as well as Paisley Caves in Oregon (c. 14,200 years BP) and Cooper&#x27;s Ferry in Idaho (c. 15,800 years BP) are suggested to be considerably older than the oldest Clovis sites. Historically, it was suggested that the ancestors of the people who produced the Clovis culture migrated into North America along the &quot;ice-free corridor&quot;, but many later scholars have suggested that a migration along the Pacific coast is more likely.

The Clovis culture is known from localities across North America, from southern Canada to northern Mexico and across the east and west of the continent. The area of its origin remains unclear, though the development of fluted Clovis points appears to have occurred in North America south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and not in Beringia. The Clovis culture may have originated from the Dyuktai lithic style widespread in Beringia. While some authors have suggested that the Clovis culture resulted from diffusion of traditions through an already pre-existing Paleoindian population, others have asserted that the culture likely originated from the expansion of a single population. In Western North America, the Clovis culture was contemporaneous with and perhaps preceded by the Western Stemmed Tradition, which produced unfluted projectile points, with the Western Stemmed Tradition continuing in the region for several thousand years after the end of Clovis.

The end of the Clovis culture may have been driven by the decline of the megafauna that the Clovis hunted, as well as decreasing mobility, resulting in local differentiation of lithic and cultural traditions across North America. This is generally considered to be the result of normal cultural change through time. There is no evidence that the disappearance of the Clovis culture was the result of the onset of the Younger Dryas, or that there was a population decline of Paleoindians following the end of the Clovis culture.

The Clovis culture was succeeded by various regional point styles, such as the Folsom tradition in central North America, the Cumberland point in mid/southern North America, the Suwannee and Simpson points in the southeast, and the Gainey points in the northeast-Great Lakes region. The Clovis and Folsom traditions may have overlapped, perhaps for around 80–400 years.

A number of authors have suggested that the Clovis culture is ancestral to other fluted point-producing cultures in Central and South America, like the widespread Fishtail or Fell point style.

==Society and culture==

===Culture===
The nineteenth century architecture has been partly preserved in the district. Earlier times are testified by the remnants of edifices, such as The House of Hajduk Veljko from the eighteenth century. Particularly interesting is the Old Church of Archangel Michael, the endowment of Miloš Obrenović, built in 1818.

The Jošanica Monastery was built in the late fourteenth century at the time of Despot Đurađ Branković&#x27;s reign, and is regarded as the finest medieval building of this region. In the vicinity of Ćuprija stands the Ravanica Monastery with the Church of Assumption, the endowment of Prince Lazar, built between 1375 and 1377. After the death of Prince Lazar Hrebeljanović in the Battle of Kosovo, his holy relics were safeguarded there until 1690, when their three-century-long resettlement with the Serb people started, only to have finally been returned to his endowment, which are there to this day.

The Resava-Manasija monastery is located in the immediate vicinity of Despotovac. The Resava endowment of Despot Stefan Lazarević was built between 1407 and 1418. During the fifteenth century, the famous Resava School carried out its work there, in the framework of several workshops in which major texts of world heritage were copied and new ones written. Konstantin the Philosopher, the author of the &quot;Hagiography of Despot Stefan&quot; and the &quot;Book on Letters&quot;, which regulated the Orthography of the Serbian language at that time, carried out his creative work in the Resava Monastery.

===Education===

==History==
Felix Romuliana (Galerius&#x27; Palace) in modern Gamzigrad is the birthplace of the Roman Emperor Gaius Galerius Valerius Maxmimianus, in late 3rd century and early 4th century. Because of its archaeological findings, Gamzigrad ranks among the most important late Roman sites in the world. The rich historic material (jewelry, mosaics, coins, tools, arms) found here is a treasure trove of Roman civilization of the 4th century A.D.

==Roman emperors==
Three Roman emperors were born in the Zaječar district:
* Galerius ruled 293–311
* Maximinus II ruled 305–312
* Licinius ruled 308–324

==Economy==
Trends of economic development of the Zaječar District lead from crafts and semi-industrial processing of agricultural products over coal exploitation (textile factory, leather factory, brewery, quartz sand mine and coal mine) to the modern plants and high output rate.

<text>Stickies is an application for Apple Macintosh computers that puts Post-it note-like windows on the screen for the user to write short reminders, notes and other clippings. Contents are automatically stored, and restored when the application is restarted.

An unrelated freeware program with the same name and similar functionality is available for Microsoft Windows.

Similar applications (described as &quot;desktop notes&quot;) are available for most operating systems.

==History==
In 1994, the first version of Stickies was written by Apple employee Jens Alfke and included in System 7.5. Alfke had originally developed it in his free time as Antler Notes and intended to release it as shareware, doing business as Antler Software. Apple planned to acquire it from him, but realized that they already legally owned it under the terms of his employment.

During the transition to Mac OS X in 2001, Stickies was rewritten in Cocoa, and is still included in macOS, with features such as transparent notes, styled text, lists, and the ability to hold pictures.

The ability to collapse note windows, which is present in all versions of Stickies, is a holdover from System 7.5&#x27;s WindowShade feature. The window button layout, which is unusual for a modern macOS application, is retained from Mac OS 8.

In macOS Big Sur, the icon has been changed to look like a stack of sticky notes in a rounded square design.

== Features ==
The Stickies application currently supports the following usage scenarios: 
* Float above all windows: Press Command-Option-F with a sticky note selected and it will float above any other windows that are visible.
* Translucent: Press Command-Option-T with a sticky note selected and it will become translucent.
* Embed other media: Add other media besides text, such as QuickTime movies, PDFs, images, just by dragging them into the sticky note.
* Backup data: Stickies keeps all information in a self-contained database. The database can be backed up by copying the file &quot;StickiesDatabase&quot;, which is located in a user&#x27;s Library directory (&quot;~/Library/StickiesDatabase&quot;).
* Search data: Press Command-F to search for words or phrases within a sticky note.
* Create a note from selection: In a Cocoa-based application (such as the Safari web browser), select some text and press Command-Shift-Y or use the Services menu to create a new sticky note with the text selection.

<text>In mathematics, the binomial series is a generalization of the polynomial that comes from a binomial formula expression like formula_1 for a nonnegative integer formula_2. Specifically, the binomial series is the MacLaurin series for the function formula_3, where formula_4 and formula_5. Explicitly,

where the power series on the right-hand side of () is expressed in terms of the (generalized) binomial coefficients

:formula_6

Note that if is a nonnegative integer then the term and all later terms in the series are , since each contains a factor of . Thus, in this case, the series is finite and gives the algebraic binomial formula.

== Convergence ==
=== Conditions for convergence ===

Whether () converges depends on the values of the complex numbers and . More precisely:

#If , the series converges absolutely for any complex number . 
#If , the series converges absolutely if and only if either or , where denotes the real part of .
# If and , the series converges if and only if .
#If , the series converges if and only if either or .
#If , the series diverges except when is a non-negative integer, in which case the series is a finite sum.

In particular, if is not a non-negative integer, the situation at the boundary of the disk of convergence, , is summarized as follows:

* If , the series converges absolutely.
* If , the series converges conditionally if and diverges if .
* If , the series diverges.

=== Identities to be used in the proof ===

The following hold for any complex number :

:formula_7

Unless formula_8 is a nonnegative integer (in which case the binomial coefficients vanish as formula_9 is larger than formula_8), a useful asymptotic relationship for the binomial coefficients is, in Landau notation:

This is essentially equivalent to Euler&#x27;s definition of the Gamma function:

:formula_11

and implies immediately the coarser bounds

\le \left|{\alpha \choose k}\right| \le \frac {M} {k^{1+\operatorname{Re}\alpha}}, &lt;/math&gt;|}}
for some positive constants and .

Formula () for the generalized binomial coefficient can be rewritten as
=== Proof ===

To prove (i) and (v), apply the ratio test and use formula () above to show that whenever formula_8 is not a nonnegative integer, the radius of convergence is exactly 1. Part (ii) follows from formula (), by comparison with the -series

:formula_13

with formula_14. To prove (iii), first use formula () to obtain

and then use (ii) and formula () again to prove convergence of the right-hand side when formula_15 is assumed. On the other hand, the series does not converge if formula_16 and formula_17, again by formula (). Alternatively, we may observe that for all formula_18, formula_19. Thus, by formula (), for all formula_20. This completes the proof of (iii). Turning to (iv), we use identity () above with formula_21 and formula_22 in place of formula_8, along with formula (), to obtain

:formula_24

as formula_25. Assertion (iv) now follows from the asymptotic behavior of the sequence formula_26. (Precisely, formula_27
certainly converges to formula_28 if formula_29 and diverges to formula_30 if formula_31. If formula_32, then formula_33 converges if and only if the sequence formula_34 converges formula_35, which is certainly true if formula_36 but false if formula_37: in the latter case the sequence is dense formula_35, due to the fact that formula_39 diverges and formula_40 converges to zero).

== Summation of the binomial series ==

The usual argument to compute the sum of the binomial series goes as follows. Differentiating term-wise the binomial series within the disk of convergence and using formula (), one has that the sum of the series is an analytic function solving the ordinary differential equation with initial condition . 

The unique solution of this problem is the function . Indeed, multiplying by the integrating factor gives

:formula_41

so the function is a constant, which the initial condition tells us is . That is, is the sum of the binomial series for .

The equality extends to whenever the series converges, as a consequence of Abel&#x27;s theorem and by continuity of .

== Negative binomial series ==
Closely related is the &quot;negative binomial series&quot; defined by the MacLaurin series for the function formula_42, where formula_4 and formula_5. Explicitly,
:formula_45
which is written in terms of the multiset coefficient
:formula_46

When is a positive integer, several common sequences are apparent. The case gives the series , where the coefficient of each term of the series is simply . The case gives the series , which has the counting numbers as coefficients. The case gives the series , which has the triangle numbers as coefficients. The case gives the series , which has the tetrahedral numbers as coefficients, and similarly for higher integer values of .

The negative binomial series includes the case of the geometric series, the power series
formula_47 
(which is the negative binomial series when formula_48, convergent in the disc formula_49) and, more generally, series obtained by differentiation of the geometric power series:
formula_50
with formula_51, a positive integer.

== History ==

The first results concerning binomial series for other than positive-integer exponents were given by Sir Isaac Newton in the study of areas enclosed under certain curves. John Wallis built upon this work by considering expressions of the form where is a fraction. He found that (written in modern terms) the successive coefficients of are to be found by multiplying the preceding coefficient by (as in the case of integer exponents), thereby implicitly giving a formula for these coefficients. He explicitly writes the following instances

:formula_52

:formula_53

:formula_54

The binomial series is therefore sometimes referred to as Newton&#x27;s binomial theorem. Newton gives no proof and is not explicit about the nature of the series. Later, on 1826 Niels Henrik Abel discussed the subject in a paper published on &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;, treating notably questions of convergence.

<text>The Zlatibor District (, ) is one of eight administrative districts of Šumadija and Western Serbia. It is located in the western, mountainous part of Serbia. The district was named after the mountainous region of Zlatibor.

As of the 2022 census, the district has a population of 254,659 inhabitants. The administrative center of the Zlatibor district is Užice. It is Serbia&#x27;s largest district, with an area of 6,140 km².

==Municipalities==

The district encompasses the municipalities of:
* Bajina Bašta
* Kosjerić
* Užice
* Požega
* Čajetina
* Arilje
* Nova Varoš
* Prijepolje
* Sjenica
* Priboj

==Demographics==

As of the 2022 census, the district has a population of 254,659 inhabitants.

==Society and culture==

===Culture===
In the vicinity of Bajina Bašta stands the Rača monastery, built in the 13th century. Over its history, this monastery was destroyed several times, and then reconstructed. Rača Monastery&#x27;s final destruction (after the Turks and the Austro-Hungarian Army), came at the hands of Bulgarian forces in 1943. It was restored after the end of World War II. The church was an important center of transcription and illumination of Serbia&#x27;s manuscripts, with its monks known as the &quot;Račani&quot;, during the 17th century.

The Mileševa Monastery, built in 1234 near Prijepolje, was the endowment of King Stefan Vladislav I of Serbia, the son of Stefan the First-Crowned.

This monastery was the second most important in Serbia, after it received the bones of Serbia&#x27;s most revered patriarch, Saint Sava, in 1236. The monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt several times, though 100 compositions, frescoes of individual figures, and fragments of important religious icons have been preserved. The most famous icon of Mileševa is &quot;The White Angel&quot; fresco, a famous, widely used religious icon throughout Serbia.

===Tourism===
The Zlatibor District is home to several tourist destinations. Visitors to the slopes of the Zlatibor Mountain explore the natural environment of Tara National Park, float down the Drina River or cruise Lake Perućac, ride the rail experience known as Šargan Eight, visit the traditional ethnic village of Mokra Gora, tour the World War II monument of Kadinjača Memorial Complex, immerse themselves in the history of Užice and its importance as an independent stronghold, or visit Kremna, home of the &quot;Prophecy from Kremna&quot;.

===Education===
There is one faculty located in the Zlatibor District that is within the University of Kragujevac:
* Teachers Training Faculty in Užice

<text>The Faraday Society was a British society for the study of physical chemistry, founded in 1903 and named in honour of Michael Faraday. In 1980, it merged with several similar organisations, including the Chemical Society, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, and the Society for Analytical Chemistry to form the Royal Society of Chemistry which is both a learned society and a professional body. At that time, the Faraday Division became one of six units within the Royal Society of Chemistry.

The Faraday Society published &quot;Faraday Transactions&quot; from 1905 to 1971, when the Royal Society of Chemistry took over the publication.

Of particular note were the conferences called &quot;Faraday Discussions&quot;, which were published under the same name. The publication includes the discussion of the paper as well as the paper itself. At the meeting, more time is given to the discussion than to the author presenting the paper as the audience are given the papers prior to the meeting. These conferences continue to be run by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

In addition to its presidents, key figures at the Faraday Society included George Stanley Withers Marlow, Secretary and Editor of the society from 1926 to 1948,
and his successor Frederick Clifford Tompkins. Tompkins served as Editor until 1977, and as the President of the Faraday Division of the amalgamated Royal Society of Chemistry from 1978 to 1979.
Prior to the amalgamation, Tompkins received valuable assistance from D. A. Young, who became Editor as of 1977.

<text>Black Oak Arkansas is an American Southern rock band named after the band&#x27;s hometown of Black Oak, Arkansas. The band reached the height of its fame in the 1970s, charting ten albums. Their style is notable for multiple guitar players and the raspy voice and on-stage antics of vocalist Jim &quot;Dandy&quot; Mangrum.

== History ==
=== The Knowbody Else ===
Black Oak Arkansas, originally named &quot;The Knowbody Else&quot;, was formed in 1963 by some &quot;high school pals&quot; living in the area around Black Oak, Arkansas. Original members included Ronnie &quot;Chicky Hawk&quot; Smith (vocals), Rickie Lee (alternately &quot;Risky&quot; or &quot;Ricochet&quot;) Reynolds (guitar), Stanley &quot;Goober Grin&quot; Knight (guitar), Harvey &quot;Burley&quot; Jett (guitar), Pat &quot;Dirty&quot; Daugherty (bass), and Wayne &quot;Squeezebox&quot; Evans (drums). At some point the band and Ronnie &quot;Chicky Hawk&quot; Smith agreed that a mutual friend named James &quot;Jim Dandy&quot; Mangrum would make a better front man, while Smith agreed that he himself would make a better stage production manager.

The band&#x27;s first PA system was stolen from Monette High School. The group cleaned out an old galvanized grain bin on the edge of town and began blasting out ear-piercing sounds that echoed their blend of music that came from rock, gospel, country and blues influences. Members of the group were subsequently charged in absentia with grand larceny and sentenced to 26 years at the Tucker Prison Farm, a sentence that was later suspended. This led to their retreat to the hills of rural north-central Arkansas where they lived off the land and refined their musical style. They also lived in Long Beach, Mississippi, and played at the local Lobe theater/dance hall and the short-lived venue, &quot;The Black Rainbow&quot;. Some of their influences during this time were the Beatles and the Byrds.

The Knowbody Else moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1969 and signed a record deal with Stax Records. Their self-titled debut album (Hip Records #HIS-7003 [a subsidiary of Stax]) was largely ignored by the public. During this time the band became interested in psychedelia and Eastern spiritualism which, combined with their Southern Baptist upbringing, contributed to their sound.

=== Black Oak Arkansas ===
After several trips to Los Angeles, California, in 1970, the band was signed by Atco Records (whose parent label, Atlantic Records, once had a partnership with Stax) and rechristened Black Oak Arkansas. Their self-titled debut album &quot;Black Oak Arkansas&quot; was released in 1971. The record featured BOA classics such as &quot;Hot and Nasty&quot;, &quot;Lord Have Mercy On My Soul&quot;, &quot;Uncle Lijiah&quot; (written in pseudo-tribute to Harvey Jett&#x27;s real-life great uncle) and &quot;When Electricity Came To Arkansas&quot;, which fundamentalist religious groups claimed contained backward-masked &quot;Satanic messages&quot; (possibly from a live performance of the song in which Mangrum utters &quot;dog si eh&quot; and &quot;natas&quot; three times). The band toured extensively, gaining a reputation as a premier live act throughout the early 1970s across America, and later in Europe. &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; followed in 1972, featuring the concert staple &quot;Fever in My Mind&quot;. Drummer Wayne Evans left the band and was replaced by drummer Tommy Aldridge on BOA&#x27;s next release &quot;If an Angel Came to See You, Would You Make Her Feel at Home?&quot;, which featured another BOA concert favorite, &quot;Mutants of the Monster&quot; and expanded on the group&#x27;s eclectic musical style.

In 1973, Black Oak Arkansas released their fourth LP, &quot;Raunch &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Live&quot;, and took the unorthodox tack of including previously unreleased new songs on their first live concert album such as &quot;Gigolo&quot;, &quot;Gettin&#x27; Kinda Cocky&quot;, as well as two more BOA classics: &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, featuring Dandy&#x27;s double-entendre lyrics, and &quot;Up&quot;, which spotlighted Aldridge&#x27;s marathon drum solo, a portion of which he played with his bare hands. The four new songs were originally recorded and intended to be included on the follow-up studio album to &quot;If an Angel Came to See You ...&quot;, but when Atco Records realized the band&#x27;s strong suit was their concert act, the live album resulted. &quot;Raunch &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Live&quot; was re-issued in 2007 by Rhino Records as a 2-CD set containing both concerts that the original vinyl album was culled from. The band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;High on the Hog&quot;, also released in 1973, ended up being the high point of BOA&#x27;s career, peaking at number 52 on the Billboard albums chart. Ruby Starr also toured intermittently with Black Oak during this period, and her raspy voice can be heard on the group&#x27;s remake of LaVern Baker&#x27;s 1957 hit &quot;Jim Dandy (To The Rescue)&quot;, which reached number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Baker&#x27;s song was recorded at the suggestion of Tom Dowd, who produced the album and was the engineer on the original LaVern Baker single. 

The band was riding high on the concert trail by this time, headlining venues like Kansas City&#x27;s Arrowhead Stadium and Charlotte Motor Speedway, and the Royal Albert Hall in London, England. Black Oak Arkansas also played at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California, on April 6, 1974. The concert attracted over 200,000 fans, and BOA appeared alongside Black Sabbath; Eagles; Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer; Deep Purple; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; Seals and Crofts; and Rare Earth. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider audience.

The follow-up to &quot;High on the Hog&quot;, 1974&#x27;s &quot;Street Party&quot; (featuring &quot;Son of a Gun&quot;, &quot;Brink of Creation&quot;, &quot;Hey Ya&#x27;ll&quot; and &quot;Dixie&quot;, as well as a cover of the Motown classic &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;), failed to maintain the momentum, but another 1974 release entitled &quot;Early Times&quot;, a shelved Stax recording by The Knowbody Else (now released on the back of their success and under the BOA banner), kept the band in the public eye. Guitarist Harvey Jett left the band after &quot;Street Party&quot; and was replaced by Jimmy &quot;Soybean&quot; Henderson in 1975 and he debuted on the band&#x27;s final studio album for Atco Records, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot;. This album included a remake of George Harrison&#x27;s Beatles classic &quot;Taxman&quot;, as well as new originals like &quot;Fancy Nancy&quot;, &quot;Rebel&quot;, &quot;Good Stuff&quot;, &quot;Cryin&#x27; Shame&quot;, and &quot;Let Life Be Good to You&quot;. The band signed a contract with MCA and promptly released &quot;X-Rated&quot; in 1975, which marked the beginning of Black Oak Arkansas&#x27;s decline. In 1976, they released two nondescript and unsuccessful albums for MCA, &quot;Balls of Fire&quot; and &quot;10 Yr Overnight Success&quot;, the latter as a five-piece band with the departure of Rickie Reynolds, who was replaced on tour by keyboardist Marius Penczner during this period. Also in 1976, Atco released a final BOA contractual-obligation album, the poorly-recorded but high-spirited &quot;Live! Mutha&quot;, recorded on Mother&#x27;s Day, 1975, in Long Beach, California. This recording saw a reappearance of Ruby Starr.

=== Black Oak ===
Following continued diminishing returns of the band&#x27;s record sales (while still remaining a consistent concert draw), Mangrum dropped &quot;Arkansas&quot; from the group&#x27;s name in an attempt to downplay their Southern-ness and replaced everyone except Henderson. He even altered his own vocal style in an attempt to sound more mainstream (and ostensibly impress music critics in the process). The other members of the &quot;Black Oak&quot; lineup were Greg Reding (guitar and keyboards), Jack Holder (guitar), Andy Tanas (bass), and Joel Williams (drums). Black Oak released two albums on the struggling Capricorn Records, &quot;Race with the Devil&quot; in 1977 and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Sailing&quot; the following year. Neither album sold well. In 1978, guitarist Shawn Lane joined the band at age 14 and toured with the band for four years.

=== Post-Capricorn Records ===
In the early 1980s, Dandy temporarily left the band for health reasons, but Reynolds kept the band going with former Zorro bassist Jack Brumby, AW Zeugner, and Les John. Bob Simpson took on lead vocals at first, but was later replaced by Randy Ruff for almost three years, until Mangrum&#x27;s return. In 1984, the band released &quot;Ready as Hell&quot;. Though the name &quot;Black Oak Arkansas&quot; was on the album cover, &quot;Jim Dandy&quot; appeared above it in larger type, almost as if it were a solo effort. &quot;Ready as Hell&quot; featured a heavier sound with pinch harmonics and keyboards featured throughout. The album was also Rickie Lee Reynolds&#x27;s first recording with Mangrum since the MCA years. In 1986, &quot;The Black Attack Is Back&quot; continued the heavy style of the previous album and featured the particularly adventurous track &quot;I Want A Woman With Big Titties&quot;. Again, &quot;Jim Dandy&quot; received top billing on the album cover (though &quot;BOA&quot;—the band&#x27;s initials—did appear above the frontman&#x27;s name). Like its predecessor, &quot;The Black Attack Is Back&quot; made no commercial headway. In 1992, the band released &quot;Rebound&quot;, this time under the band&#x27;s aegis, with similar results. Things changed little with 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, which was released under the name &quot;Jim Dandy&#x27;s Black Oak Arkansas&quot;. However, an original member would rejoin Black Oak and appear on this album. Patrick &quot;Dirty&quot; Daugherty rejoined in 1995, rekindling the once-forgotten Black Oak Arkansas. This momentum brought on a surge of performances with other 70&#x27;s greats such as Foghat, Iron Butterfly, Edgar Winter Group, and many more. During the early 2000s, original lead guitarist Stanley Knight would join them on the road, not playing guitar, but as their soundman. Pat left the band a second time in the mid-2000s.

James Mangrum has continued recording and touring with a series of different Black Oak lineups, up to the present day. Black Oak Arkansas currently enjoys a loyal fan following. Jim Dandy is credited with inspiring Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth&#x27;s image and onstage persona. In addition, in the 1980s former Maine State Representative Chris Greeley once &#x27;opened&#x27; for them as a member of the rock band Toyz.

=== The return to Atlantic Records ===
The band released an album for Atlantic Records/Atco Records on October 15, 2013, titled &quot;Back Thar N&#x27; Over Yonder&quot;. The album contained five newly recorded songs and 10 previously unreleased 1970s tracks which were produced by Tom Dowd. The new songs featured a lineup of original and current members. Reunited originals Jim &quot;Dandy&quot; Mangrum, Rickie Lee &quot;Risky&quot; Reynolds, Pat &quot;Dirty&quot; Daugherty, and Jimmy &quot;Soybean&quot; Henderson, were joined by current drummer Johnnie Bolin, bassist George Hughen, guitarist Buddy Church and lead guitarist Hal McCormack. The first single off the record &quot;Plugged In And Wired&quot; was released August 26, 2013. The band toured to support the album.

=== 2019 to Present ===
On May 24, 2019, Black Oak Arkansas released &quot;Underdog Heroes&quot;, their first album consisting of all new recordings in 30 years. The album featured founding members Jim Dandy Mangrum and Rickie Lee Reynolds, and Sammy B Seauphine as an additional vocalist. On September 22, 2023, the band released &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;, a cover album, on Cleopatra Records.

In 2024, the new lineup for Black Oak Arkansas was unveiled, featuring Jim Dandy on lead vocals, Sammy Seauphine on duet vocals, Kinley Wolfe on bass guitar, Josh Decker on rhythm guitar, and Chris Craig on drums. The lineup debuted on March 1st as the opening act for Rickey Medlocke in Medina, Minnesota.

In 2025, the band embarks on a mini-tour of the West Coast, featuring an appearance the 53rd anniversary party for the Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill in West Hollywood, California. They will be appearing alongside Michael Monroe, Faster Pussycat, and others.

===Culture===
At the outskirts of Kraljevo stands the Žiča monastery. This spiritual center of the Serbian medieval state was built around 1220, to also become the center of newly founded Serbian Archiepiscopacy.

The Studenica monastery was built in the late twelfth century, as the endowment of the Serb ruler Stefan Nemanja, who endowed it richly with icons and books. After he had become a monk and left for the Serbian Hilandar on Mt. Athos, his older son Stefan, later named the &quot;First-Crowned&quot;, took his place as the caretaker of the monastery. In the vicinity of Novi Pazar stands the Sopoćani monastery, built around 1260 as the endowment of King Stefan Uroš I, the son of King Stefan the First-Crowned. The primary and major value of the Sopoćani monastery are its frescoes, by which it ranks among the best examples of European medieval painting.

==Culture and history==
Kruševac and its vicinity are distinguished by numerous historic monuments: The Lazar&#x27;s Town, with the remnants of the medieval fortification and the Lazarica Church has an epic quality in the Serbian tradition. The Lazarica Church, built in 1376 on the occasion of Stephan&#x27;s son birth, and dedicated to St. Stephen, is the model of the Moravska School.

A Donjon Tower, the military fortification of the medieval castle, bears witness of the great cultural and historic heritage of the Serb people. The Monastery of Ljubostinja was founded by Princess Milica, Lazar&#x27;s wife, in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth century, after the Battle of Kosovo, when she made a decision on her withdrawal as a ruler, and on assembling the widows of the Serbian gentry killed at the Kosovo. From its first days the Ljubostinja played an important part in culture. Distinguished chroniclers, engrossers, book design masters, and painters were asked to come here.

<doc id="696653" wikidata="Q836370" url="?curid=696653" title="OPML">
<text>OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language) is an XML format for outlines (defined as &quot;a tree, where each node contains a set of named attributes with string values&quot;). Originally developed by UserLand Software as a native file format for the outliner application in its Radio UserLand product, it has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of web feeds between web feed aggregators.

The OPML specification defines an outline as a hierarchical, ordered list of arbitrary elements. The specification is fairly open which makes it suitable for many types of list data.

Support for importing and exporting RSS feed lists in OPML format is available in Mozilla Thunderbird and in most other RSS reader web sites and applications.

==XML format==
The XML elements in an OPML document are:

; codice_1
: This is the root element. It must contain the version attribute and one &quot;head&quot; and one &quot;body&quot; element.

; codice_2
: Contains metadata. May include any of these optional elements: &quot;title&quot;, &quot;dateCreated&quot;, &quot;dateModified&quot;, &quot;ownerName&quot;, &quot;ownerEmail&quot;, &quot;expansionState&quot;, &quot; vertScrollState&quot;, &quot;windowTop&quot;, &quot;windowLeft&quot;, &quot;windowBottom&quot;, &quot;windowRight&quot;. Each element is a simple text element. &quot;dateCreated&quot; and &quot;dateModified&quot; contents conform to the date-time format specified in . &quot;expansionState&quot; contains a comma-separated list of line numbers that should be expanded on display. The &quot;windowXXX&quot; elements define the position and size of the display window. An OPML processor may ignore all the &quot;head&quot; sub-elements. If the outline is opened inside another outline then the processor must ignore the window elements.

; codice_3
: Contains the content of the outline. Must have at least one &quot;outline&quot; element.

; codice_4
: Represents a line in the outline. May contain any number of arbitrary attributes. Common attributes include &quot;text&quot; and &quot;type&quot;. The outline element may contain any number of &quot;outline&quot; sub-elements.

==Criticism==

# The RFC 822 date format is considered obsolete, and amongst other things permits the representation of years as two digits. (RFC 822 has been superseded by RFC 2822 then RFC 5322.) In general, date and time formats should be represented according to RFC 3339.
# Due to the semantics of the &quot;expansionState&quot; attribute:
#* The expansion state of the children of collapsed nodes cannot be stored
#* When an outline element is expanded, collapsed, added, deleted or moved, the expansion state of all elements below it must be recalculated
# Due to the arbitrary nature of the &quot;type&quot; attribute, and the acceptance of arbitrary attributes on &quot;outline&quot; elements, interoperability of OPML documents relies almost entirely on the undocumented conventions of content producers.
# MIME types aren&#x27;t clear; text/xml usually merely identifies the document as having XML content, while text/x-opml does not specify that the document is XML since it lacks the +xml suffix.
==Validation==
Dave Winer, the founder and CEO of Userland, has made a request for comments on a proposal for validating OPML and released a beta OPML validator.

Katy Ginger from DLESE has published an XML Schema Document for validating OPML 2.0. There is also a DTD available for OPML 1.0.

==Alternative specifications==
Alternative specifications have been proposed, notably these include OML, XOXO and XBEL.

<doc id="696656" wikidata="Q970037" url="?curid=696656" title="Martín Dihigo">
<text>Martín Magdaleno Dihigo Llanos (May 25, 1906 – May 20, 1971), called &quot;The Immortal&quot; and &quot;The Maestro&quot;, was a Cuban pitcher, utility player, and manager. He played in the Negro leagues and Latin American winter leagues from 1923 to 1945 as a two-way player, predominantly as a pitcher and a second baseman, although he excelled at all nine positions and later as a manager.

Debuting with the Cuban Stars in 1923, Dihigo spent most of his early career in the Negro leagues. He led the Eastern Colored League in home runs in 1926 and tied for the lead in 1927. He had successful stints with the Homestead Grays and Hilldale Giants, and signed with the New York Cubans as player manager in 1935. Dihigo spent much of his later playing career in the Mexican League, though he returned to the New York Cubans for the 1945 season.

Dihigo was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977, the second Hispanic-born ballplayer to be inducted after Roberto Clemente. He also holds the unique distinction of membership in three other baseball halls of fame: Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican.

== Early career ==
Dihigo was born in the sugarmill town of Cidra in Matanzas Province, Cuba. He was the only child of Benito Dihigo, a sergeant in the Cuban Liberation Army who fought against Spanish rule, and Maria Llanos. At the age of four, his family moved to a modest wood-frame house in Matanzas, less than one hundred yards from the historic Palmar de Junco that was supposedly the site of Cuba&#x27;s first baseball game.

He began his professional baseball career in the winter of 1922-23 at the age of 16 as a substitute infielder for Habana in the Cuban League. As a pitcher, he once defeated Satchel Paige while Paige was touring Cuba.

== Negro leagues ==
The following summer, Dihigo broke into American baseball as a first baseman for the Cuban Stars. He played in the Negro leagues from 1923 through and again briefly in . Over the course of his career, he played all nine positions. As a hitter, he led the Negro leagues in home runs in and .

Dihigo&#x27;s career record in twelve seasons in the Negro leagues was a .307 average and .511 slugging percentage, with 431 hits, 64 home runs, 61 doubles, 17 triples, 227 RBI, and 292 runs scored in 1404 at bats. He drew 143 walks and stole 41 bases. As a pitcher, he went 26–19 with a 2.92 ERA, with 176 strikeouts and 80 walks in 354 innings. Dihigo served as player-manager of the New York Cubans in 1935 and 1936.

== Latin American leagues ==

From 1922 to 1947, he spent much of Cuban career with Habana, though he also played several seasons with Almendares (1923–24, 1929–30, 1931–32), Marianao (1926–27, 1936–38), Santa Clara (1935–36), and Cienfuegos (1939–40, 1945–47). Over the course of his Cuban League career, he accumulated a 109-59 record as a pitcher with a .296 average at the plate. 

From, Dihigo played in Venezuela from 1931 to 1935, mainly with the Concordia club owned by Gonzalo Gómez, son of President Juan Vicente Gómez. There he played alongside Hall of Famers Johnny Mize and Josh Gibson, as well as Luis Aparicio Sr. and Tetelo Vargas.Dihigo also played with Concordia in overseas tournaments in Puerto Rico (1933) and the Dominican Republic (1934).

Although a two-time All-Star in the American Negro leagues, Dihigo&#x27;s greatest season came in with Rojos del Aguila de Veracruz in the Mexican League, where he went 18-2 with a 0.90 ERA as a pitcher, while winning the batting title with a .387 average. In another season in the Mexican League, he had a 0.15 ERA. In his Mexican career, he was 119-57 with a .317 batting average. In Cuba, Dihigo was known as &quot;El Inmortal&quot; (&quot;The Immortal&quot;); in other Latin American countries, he was called &quot;El Maestro&quot; (&quot;The Master&quot;).

In 1943, at the age of 38, Martin Dihigo managed his own baseball team. This team was located in the Dominican Republic and featured New York Giants player Johnny Mize. While coaching the team he also was a player. They had a 6-3 record but then lost three games in a row to end the exhibition tour.

== Career statistics ==

In Dihigo&#x27;s career, including statistics from Dominican, American, Cuban, and Mexican leagues, he compiled a lifetime .302 career batting average with 130 home runs, although eleven seasons of home run totals are missing. As a pitcher, he compiled a 252-132 win–loss record.

== Post-playing career ==

After retiring, Dihigo became a radio announcer for the Cuban Winter League. He fled Cuba in 1952 to protest the rise of Fulgencio Batista. He managed the Leones del Caracas in the 1953 Caribbean Series. Upon Fidel Castro&#x27;s rise to power, Dihigo returned to Cuba where he continued to mentor other players until his death.

Dihigo died at age 64, on May 20, 1971, in Cienfuegos, Cuba. He is buried in Cementerio Municipal Cruces in Cruces, Cienfuegos, Cuba. 

== Legacy and honors ==

Known as humorous, good-natured, well read, as well as a versatile player, Dihigo is one of the only players to be inducted into four major baseball halls of fame: the American, Cuban, Mexican, and Dominican Baseball Halls of Fame.

Dihigo&#x27;s stature as a ballplayer is reflected in this conversation between former Dodgers general manager Al Campanis and broadcaster Jaime Jarrín:

Others had heaped praise on him earlier, as well. Hall of Famer Buck Leonard said, “He was the greatest all-around player I know. I’d say he was the best ballplayer of all time, black or white. He could do it all. He is my ideal ballplayer, makes no difference what race either. If he’s not the greatest I don’t know who is. You take your Ruths, Cobbs, and DiMaggios. Give me Dihigo and I bet I’d beat you almost every time.” 

Hall of Famer Johnny Mize said, “He was the only guy I ever saw who could play all nine positions, manage, run and switch-hit.”

In February 2025, Dihigo was selected by a committee of journalists as a pitcher for the Mexican League Centennial All-Time Team on the occasion of the league&#x27;s hundredth anniversary.

<doc id="696671" wikidata="Q240620" url="?curid=696671" title="Lunaria annua">
<text>Lunaria annua, commonly called honesty or annual honesty, is a species of flowering plant in the cabbage and mustard family Brassicaceae. It is native to southern Europe, and cultivated throughout the temperate world.
==Description==
It is an annual or biennial growing to tall by broad, with large, coarse, pointed oval leaves with marked serrations. The leaves are hairy, the lower ones long-stalked, the upper ones stalkless. In spring and summer it bears terminal racemes of white, pink or violet flowers, followed by showy, green through light brown, translucent, disc-shaped siliques (not true botanical seedpods), sometimes called moonpennies. When a silique is ripe and dry, a valve on each of its sides readily falls off, and its seeds fall off a central membrane which has a silvery sheen, in diameter; the membrane can persist on a plant throughout a winter depending on the weather. These siliques are much used in dry floral arrangements.

==Distribution==
&quot;Lunaria annua&quot; is native to southern Europe from Spain to Romania, and has been introduced to many other parts of the world with temperate climates.

==Names==
The Latin name &quot;lunaria&quot; means &#x27;moon-shaped&#x27; and refers to the shape and appearance of this species&#x27; siliques. The common name &quot;honesty&quot; arose in the 16th century, and relates to the translucence of its silique membranes, which &quot;truthfully&quot; reveal their contents. Additional English names include &quot;money plant&quot;, &quot;moneywort&quot;, &quot;penny flower&quot;, &quot;silver dollar&quot;, and &quot;money-in-both-pockets&quot;, &quot;Chinese money&quot;, or &quot;Chinese coins&quot;. These too reference the silique membranes, which have the appearance of silvery coins. In French it is known as &quot;monnaie du pape&quot; (&quot;Pope&#x27;s money&quot;). In Denmark it is known as &quot;judaspenge&quot; and in Dutch-speaking countries as &quot;judaspenning&quot; (both meaning &quot;coins of Judas&quot;), an allusion to the story of Judas Iscariot and the thirty pieces of silver he was paid for betraying Christ.

==Symbolism==
In the language of flowers, the plant represents honesty, money, and sincerity. In witchcraft, the honesty plant is considered protective, being thought to keep away monsters. The plant is also used in spells for prosperity, the flat pods (when ripe and silvery) resembling coins and therefore being seen as symbolising promises of wealth. In the earliest surviving recipe for a flying ointment (recorded by Bavarian physician Johannes Hartlieb circa 1440), &quot;Lunaria&quot; is included as the herbal ingredient corresponding astrologically to the moon and therefore to be picked on the lunar day of Monday.

==Cultivation==
This plant is easy to grow from seed and tends to naturalize. It is usually grown as a biennial, being sown one year to flower the next. It is suitable for cultivation in a shady or dappled area, or in a wildflower garden, and the flowers and dried siliques are often seen in flower arrangements. Numerous varieties and cultivars are available, of which the white-flowered &quot;L. annua&quot; var. &quot;albiflora&quot; and the variegated white &quot;L. annua&quot; var. &quot;albiflora&quot; &#x27;Alba Variegata&#x27; have won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>The Southern Combination Football League (named Premier Sports Southern Combination Football League) is a football league broadly covering the counties of East Sussex, West Sussex, Surrey and South West London, England. The league consists of eight divisions – three for first teams (Premier Division, Division One and Division Two), two for Under 23 teams (East Division and West Division) and three for Under 18 teams (East Division, Central Division and West Division).

==History==

Formed in 1920 as the Sussex County Football League, started with just one league with 12 teams. By the end of the 1929–30 season, six of the original twelve teams remained, having played in every campaign since the competition began. The league saw regular changes in members between 1921 and 1928 and saw 23 clubs taking part. The league closed down during the Second World War and the league ran two competition sections in the 1945–46 season, an Eastern division with eight teams and a Western division with 9 teams. The winners of each competition played in a play-off for a champion. A normal single league practice resumed in 1946 with 14 clubs now playing.

A new division was created in 1952 when Division Two was instituted. Division One remained with 14 teams and Division Two with 12 teams. By 1958 the two leagues had 16 teams each. The 1962–63 season was abandoned due to the atrocious weather conditions, with some clubs playing over 20 games and others with only 13 or 14 games played; an emergency competition was played in a group stage style format with knock-out stages to the final. The 1970s saw the league membership decline.
In 1983 a third division was added for intermediate level teams looking for an easy entry into the football league pyramid system, and a 3-points-for-a-win system was introduced. Divisions One and Two remained at 16 teams each, Division Three started with 13 teams, increasing to 15 two seasons later. Some long term clubs experienced harder times and dropped into Division Two. A &quot;Two Up Two Down&quot; system of promotion and relegation was applied throughout the period but was occasionally affected by departures from the league itself. Division One increased to 18 teams for the 1988–89 season and 20 teams for the 1993–94 season, along with Division One increasing to 18 teams in the same season. Division Three increased to 16 teams in 2000.

The league changed its name to the Southern Combination Football League for the start of the 2015–16 season, keeping the acronym SCFL also attracting teams just across the Sussex border when the Football Association (FA) moved teams across leagues. The divisions were renamed at this time to Premier Division, Division One and Division Two, with the last keeping its intermediate status. Also, for the 2015–16 season the league added two U21s divisions, one in the East, and one in the West, consisting of 7 teams each, which lasted until the end of the 2017–18 season and replaced by two Under–23 divisions (East and West), and three Under–18 divisions (East, Central and West).

The Sin Bin rule was introduced for the 2019–20 season to reduce dissent between the players, also during the same season the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic halted all sporting events nationwide; the leagues and the Football Association agreed to end the season early and expunge all results, with no promotion or relegation between the leagues.

The league season was abandoned for a third time after the FA Alliance and Leagues committees announced that the 2020–21 would be curtailed, subject to ratification by The FA Council, with immediate effect.

The first team divisions – Premier, One and Two, sit at Steps 5 and 6, and level 11, formerly Step 7, of the English football league system, below the lower divisions of the Isthmian League and the Southern League. The reserve divisions are not part of the league system.

==Sponsorship==
In the past, Unijet, Rich City, Matthew Clark and Badger Ales sponsored the Sussex County Football League. But between 2006 and 2014 the league was without a sponsor. Macron Store (Hastings) signed a 4-year deal beginning in the 2014–15 season resulting in the official name being changed to The Macron Sussex County League and then to The Macron Southern Combination Football League a year later. On 20 June 2023 Premier Sports announced at the League Annual General Meeting that they would be sponsoring the league.

==Champions==
===1920–1939===
The league originally consisted of a single section of 12 clubs, and had reached a stable membership of 14 clubs when it was abandoned on the outbreak of World War II. The fore-runner of the League Cup, known then as the Baldwin Cup (generically Invitation Cup) was introduced in 1938-39 with six teams invited. Lewes were the inaurgural final winners beating Littlehampton 5-0 at Newhaven on 6 May 1939.

===1939–1941===
During the Second World War an emergency competition was played. The league operated two region divisions, East and West, with the winners of each playing in a play-off
===1945–1946===
For the first post-War season, the league also operated two regional divisions, East and West, with the winners of each facing each other in a play-off.
===1946–1952===
After a single split format, the league reverted to a single division for the next six seasons.
===1952–1983===
A second division was instituted in 1952. A two-division format continued for over 30 years, the only deviation being in the 1962–63 season when the unusually harsh winter weather made the league impossible to finish. The normal league competitions were abandoned and a set of emergency competitions were played for in the second half of the season.
===1983–2015===
After a two division format had proved sufficient for over 30 years, a third division was added in 1983. While the top two divisions were for clubs holding senior status with the Sussex FA, the new Division Three was for clubs of intermediate status.
===2015–present===
In 2015, the Sussex County Football League was re-branded to the Southern Combination Football League, keeping the acronym SCFL. The divisions were renamed to Premier Division, Division One and Division Two, Division Two clubs still holding intermediate status.
&lt;br&gt;
==Promoted==
Since the league&#x27;s formation, the following clubs have won promotion to higher levels of the English football league system. Crawley Town are currently the only English Football League team to play in the Sussex County League.

<text>The Lucy spy ring () was an anti-Nazi World War II espionage operation headquartered in Switzerland and run by Rudolf Roessler, a German refugee. Its story was only published in 1966, and very little is clear about the ring, Roessler, or the effort&#x27;s sources or motives.

==History==
At the outbreak of World War II, Roessler was a political refugee from Bavaria who had fled to Switzerland when Hitler came to power. He was the founder of a small publishing firm, Vita Nova Verlag, producing copies of anti-Nazi Exilliteratur and other literary works in the German language strictly banned under censorship in Nazi Germany, for smuggling across the border and black market distribution to dissident intellectuals. He was employed by Brigadier Masson, head of Swiss Military Intelligence, who employed him as an analyst with Bureau Ha, overtly a press cuttings agency but in fact a covert department of Swiss Intelligence. Roessler was approached by two German officers, Fritz Thiele and Rudolph von Gersdorff, who were part of a German resistance conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, and had been known to Roessler in the 1930s through the Herrenklub.

Thiele and Gersdorf wished him to act as a conduit for high-level military information, to be made available to him to make use of in the fight against Nazism. This they accomplished by equipping Roessler with a radio and an Enigma machine, and designating him as a German military station (call-signed RAHS). In this way they could openly transmit their information to him through normal channels. They were able to do this as Thiele, and his superior, Erich Fellgiebel (who was also part of the conspiracy), were in charge of the German Defence Ministry&#x27;s communication centre, the Bendlerblock. This was possible, as those employed to encode the information were unaware of where it was going, while those transmitting the messages had no idea what was in them.

At first Roessler passed the information to Swiss military intelligence, via a friend who was serving in Bureau Ha, an intelligence agency used by the Swiss as a cut-out. Roger Masson, the head of Swiss MI, also chose to pass some of this information to the British SIS. Later, seeking to aid the USSR in its role in the fight against Nazism, Roessler was able to pass on information to it via another contact who was a part of a Soviet (GRU) network run by Alexander Rado. Roessler was not a Communist, nor even a Communist sympathizer until much later, and wished to remain at arm&#x27;s length from Rado&#x27;s network, insisting on complete anonymity and communicating with Rado only through the courier, Christian Schneider. Rado agreed to this, recognizing the value of the information being received. Rado code-named the source &quot;Lucy&quot;, simply because all he knew about the source was that it was in Lucerne.
Roessler&#x27;s first major contribution to Soviet intelligence came in May 1941 when he was able to deliver details of Operation Barbarossa, Germany&#x27;s impending invasion of the Soviet Union. Though his warning was initially ignored - as Soviet intelligence had received multiple false alarms about an impending German invasion - Roessler&#x27;s dates eventually proved accurate. Following the invasion, in June 1941, Lucy was regarded as a VYRDO source, &quot;i.e.&quot; of the highest importance, and to be transmitted immediately. Over the next two years &quot;Lucy&quot; was able to supply the Soviets with high grade military intelligence. During the autumn of 1942, &quot;Lucy&quot; provided the Soviets with detailed information about Case Blue, the German operations against Stalingrad and the Caucasus; during this period decisions taken in Berlin were arriving in Moscow on average within a ten-hour period; on one occasion in just six hours, not much longer than it took to reach German front line units. Roessler, and Rado&#x27;s network, particularly Allan Foote, Rado&#x27;s main radio operator, were prepared to work flat out to maintain the speed and flow of the information. At the peak of its operation, Rado&#x27;s network was enciphering and sending several hundred messages per month, many of these from &quot;Lucy&quot;. Meanwhile, Roessler alone had to do all the receiving, decoding and evaluating of the &quot;Lucy&quot; messages before passing them on; for him during this period it became a full-time operation. In the summer of 1943, the culmination of &quot;Lucy&#x27;s&quot; success came in transmitting the details of Germany&#x27;s plans for Operation Citadel, a planned summer offensive against the Kursk salient, which became a strategic defeat for the German army—the Battle of Kursk gave the Red Army the initiative on the eastern front for the remainder of the war.

During the winter of 1942, the Germans became aware of the transmissions from the Rado network, and began to take steps against it through their counter-espionage bureau. After several attempts to penetrate the network they succeeded in pressuring the Swiss to close it down in October 1943, when its radio transmitters were closed down and a number of key operatives were arrested. Thereafter Roessler&#x27;s only outlet for the &quot;Lucy&quot; information was through the Bureau Ha and Swiss Military Intelligence. Roessler was unaware his information was also going to the Western Allies.

The Lucy spy ring came to an end in the summer of 1944 when the German members, who were also involved in other anti-Nazi activities, were arrested in the aftermath of the failed 20 July plot.

==Members==
In Switzerland the Lucy network consisted of the following members:
*Rudolf Roessler, code-named &quot;Lucy&quot; 
*Xaver Schnieper, Roessler&#x27;s Bureau Ha contact 
*, code-named &quot;Taylor&quot;, Roessler&#x27;s GRU contact 
*Rachel Dübendorfer, code-named &quot;Sissy&quot;, Schneider&#x27;s handler
*Alexander Rado, code-named &quot;Dora&quot;, head of the espionage group Red Three (; part of the &quot;Red Orchestra&quot;), part of the Soviet GRU espionage network in WW II in Switzerland 
*Allan Foote, code-named &quot;Jim&quot;, the &quot;Dora&quot; network&#x27;s main radio operator

==Identity of sources==
The record of messages transmitted show that Roessler had four important sources, codenamed &quot;Werther&quot;, &quot;Teddy&quot;, &quot;Olga&quot;, and &quot;Anna&quot;. While it was never discovered who they were, the quartet was responsible for 42.5 percent of the intelligence sent from Switzerland to the Soviet Union.

The search for the identity of those sources has created a very large body of work of varying quality and offering various conclusions. Several theories can be dismissed immediately, including by Foote and several other writers, that the code names reflected the sources&#x27; access type rather than their identity- for example, that Werther stood for Wehrmacht, Olga for Oberkommando der Luftwaffe, Anna for Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office)- as the evidence does not support it. Alexander Radó made this claim in his memoirs, that were examined in a Der Spiegel article. Three and a half years before his death, Roessler described the identity of the four sources to a confidant. They were a German major who was in charge of the Abwehr before Wilhelm Canaris, Hans Bernd Gisevius, Carl Goerdeler and a General Boelitz, who was then deceased.

The most reliable study by the CIA Historical Review Program concluded that of the four sources, the most important source was &quot;Werther&quot;. The study stated he was likely Wehrmacht General Hans Oster, other Abwehr officers working with Swiss intelligence, or Swiss intelligence on its own.There was no evidence to link the other three codenames to known individuals. The CIA believed that the German sources gave their reports to Swiss General Staff, who in turn supplied Roessler with information that the Swiss wanted to pass to the Soviets.

==Controversy==
Roessler&#x27;s story was first published in 1966 by the French journalists Pierre Accoce and Pierre Quet. In 1981, it was alleged by Anthony Read and David Fisher that Lucy was, at its heart, a British Secret Service operation intended to get Ultra information to the Soviets in a convincing way untraceable to British codebreaking operations against the Germans. Stalin had shown considerable suspicion of any information from the British about German plans to invade Russia in 1941, so an Allied effort to find a way to get helpful information to the Soviets in a form that would not be dismissed or, at least, not implausible. That the Soviets had, via their own espionage operations, learned of the British break into important German message traffic was not, at the time, known to the British. Various observations have suggested that Allan Foote was more than a mere radio operator: he was in a position to act as a radio interface between SIS and Roessler, and also between Roessler and Moscow; his return to the West in the 1950s was unusual in several ways; and his book was similarly troublesome. They also point out that not one of Roessler&#x27;s claimed sources in Germany has been identified or has come forward. Hence their suspicion that, even more so than for most espionage operations, the Lucy ring was not what it seemed.

However, this is flatly denied by Harry Hinsley, the official historian for the British Secret Services in World War II, who stated that &quot;there is no truth in the much-publicized claim that the British authorities made use of the ‘Lucy’ ring..to forward intelligence to Moscow&quot;.

Phillip Knightley also dismisses the thesis that Ultra was the source of Lucy. He indicates that the information was delivered very promptly (often within 24 hours) to Moscow, too fast if it had come via GCHQ Bletchley Park. Further, Ultra intelligence on the Eastern front was less than complete; many of the German messages were transmitted by landlines and wireless messages were often too garbled for timely decoding. Furthermore, the Enigma systems employed by German forces on the Eastern Front were only broken intermittently. Knightley suggests that the source was Karel Sedlacek, a Czech military intelligence officer. Sedlacek died in London in 1967 and indicated that he received the information from one or more unidentified dissidents within the German High Command. Another, but less likely possibility Knightley suggests is, that the information came from the Swiss secret service.

V. E. Tarrant echoes Knightley&#x27;s objections, and in addition points out that Read and Fisher&#x27;s scenario was unnecessary, as Britain was already passing Ultra information to the Soviet Union following the German invasion in June 1941. While not wishing to reveal Britain&#x27;s penetration of Enigma, Churchill ordered selected Ultra information to be passed via the British Military Mission in Moscow, reported as coming from &quot;a well-placed source in Berlin,&quot; or &quot;a reliable source&quot;. However, as the Soviets showed little interest in co-operation on intelligence matters, refusing to share Soviet intelligence that would be useful to Britain (such as information on German air forces in the Eastern Front) or agreeing to use the Soviet mission in London as a transmission route, the British cut back the flow of information in the spring of 1942, and by the summer it had dwindled to a trickle. This hypothesis, that Britain lost the motivation to share intelligence with Stalin after this time, is also at variance with Read and Fisher&#x27;s theory.

<text>David Marcus (21 August 1924 in County Cork9 May 2009) was an Irish Jewish editor and writer who was a lifelong advocate for and editor of Irish fiction.

== Life and times ==
Born in County Cork in 1924, Marcus was the much-loved editor of numerous anthologies of Irish fiction and poetry, including the &quot;Phoenix Irish Short Stories&quot; collections.

Other notable projects included the page &quot;New Irish Writing&quot; for the &quot;Irish Press&quot;, which provided a forum for aspiring Irish authors, publishing most of the most important names in Irish fiction, many for the first time, including Dermot Bolger, Ita Daly, Anne Enright, Neil Jordan, Claire Keegan, John McGahern, Michael Feeney Callan, Bernard MacLaverty, Eilis Ni Dhuibhne, Joseph O&#x27;Connor, Colm Tóibín, Colum McCann and William Wall. He was, in the words of Fintan O&#x27;Toole &quot;the single most important literary editor in Ireland in the second half of the 20th century&quot;.

His 1986 novel, &quot;A Land Not Theirs&quot;, a fictionalized account of the experiences of the Cork Jewish community during the Irish War of Independence was a bestseller. In 1986, his second novel, which drew on his experiences among the Cork Jewish community, &quot;A Land in Flames&quot; was also a popular success.

In 2001, Marcus published &quot;Oughtobiography – Leaves from the diary of a hyphenated Jew&quot;, an autobiographical review of his life as an Irish Jew and as an important figure in Irish literature.

On 3 June 2005, he was awarded an honorary Degree of Doctor of Literature by the National University of Ireland, University College, Cork.

Marcus was married to fellow Irish novelist Ita Daly and lived in Rathgar in Dublin. In 2016 she published a memoir of their life together, &quot;I&#x27;ll Drop You a Line: A Life With David Marcus&quot;.

<doc id="696691" wikidata="Q1470734" url="?curid=696691" title="Youghiogheny River">
<text>The Youghiogheny River ( ), or the Yough ( ) for short, is a tributary of the Monongahela River in West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. It drains an area on the west side of the Allegheny Mountains northward into Pennsylvania, providing a small watershed in extreme western Maryland into the tributaries of the Mississippi River. Youghiogheny is a Lenape word meaning &quot;a stream flowing in a contrary direction&quot;.

==Variant names==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as: 
* Gawgawgamie, Ohio Gani River, Roonanetto, Yanghyanghgain, Yaughvaughani, Yauyougaine River, Yawyawganey, Yawyougaine River, Yeoyogani, Yochio Geni, Yoghioghenny River, Yogyogany River, Yohioganey, Yohogany, Youghiogeny River, Youghogania, Youghyaughye, Youghyoghgyina River, Yoxhio geni River, Yoxhiogany, Yoxhiogeny, Yoxyougaine River, Yughiogeny

==Course==
The Youghiogheny rises in northern West Virginia, in Preston County southeast of Aurora and near Backbone Mountain. The headwaters are approximately north of the headwaters of the North Branch Potomac River and pass through Silver Lake before flowing north-northeast into Garrett County, Maryland, then flowing north past Oakland and roughly parallel to the West Virginia border, separated by approximately . The river enters southwestern Pennsylvania on the border between Fayette and Somerset counties. It flows northwest through a gap in Chestnut Ridge and then past Connellsville. It joins the Monongahela River from the southeast (right bank) at McKeesport.

Just upstream from Confluence, Pennsylvania, approximately north of the Pennsylvania border, the river is impounded by the Youghiogheny Dam to form the Youghiogheny River Lake, a reservoir that stretches upstream into northern Maryland. The dam was completed in 1944 primarily for flood control. U.S. Route 40 crosses the Youghiogheny River Lake between Jockey Hollow on the Fayette County side and Somerfield on the Somerset County side.

==History==

In the colonial era and in the early United States, the valley of the river provided an important route of access through the mountains for settlers and military forces from Virginia to western Pennsylvania and the Ohio Country. In 1754, as a militia officer of the British Colony of Virginia, George Washington followed the river in an attempt to find a water route to Fort Duquesne, then held by the French.

During the uncommonly severe winter of 1787-88, American pioneers to the Northwest Territory departed New England and cut trails westward through the mountains. At Sumrill&#x27;s Ferry, present-day West Newton, Pennsylvania, on the Youghiogheny River, the men built flatboats which carried them down the Youghiogheny River to the Monongahela River, and then to the Ohio River, and onward to the Northwest Territory.

The pioneer town of Somerfield, Pennsylvania, was inundated by the building of the Youghiogheny Dam in 1943. Perryopolis in northern Fayette County, Pennsylvania, is the site of the George Washington Grist Mill. The Youghiogheny River Trail follows the river in southwestern Pennsylvania southeast of Connellsville.

Coal mining became an important industry along the lower Youghiogheny River during the 19th century. At that time, the name was often spelled &quot;Yohoghany&quot; (or variants thereof), and during the 1860s and 1870s that spelling was used as the name of a post office near what is now Shaner in Westmoreland County.

In 1976, a segment of the Youghiogheny in Maryland was given special protected status by the state as the Youghiogheny Scenic &amp; Wild River. Though most of the land along this corridor is private, it is managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to preserve its natural and cultural resources.

==Recreation and travel==
The Youghiogheny is popular for whitewater canoeing, kayaking and rafting. Four sections of the river, varying in difficulty, are available on a predictable basis for whitewater recreation:
* Top Yough, near Swallow Falls State Park in Maryland (Class IV-V)
* Upper Yough, from Sang Run to Friendsville, Maryland (Class IV-V)
* Middle Yough, from Confluence, Pennsylvania to Ohiopyle (Class II)
* Ohiopyle Falls in Ohiopyle State Park: Previously, this spectacular waterfall was legal for kayakers and canoeists to run on &quot;only&quot; one weekend a year (Class IV), during a race and festival. In August 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources announced a pilot program allowing boaters to run the falls during three weeks that fall. The program was successful, so the falls are accessible to whitewater kayakers and canoeists with the same rules as the test program.
* Lower Yough, which runs through Ohiopyle State Park from Ohiopyle to Bruner Run (Class III). This section is the busiest whitewater trip east of the Mississippi River, being completed by over 250,000 people each year.
* Further downstream, near Connellsville, the river is much slower, without whitewater rapids, and is able to be piloted by personal tubes, kayaks or canoes.

Although the Youghiogheny is generally considered to be safe for whitewater recreation, there have been 19 deaths on the Lower Yough. At least five, and possibly as many as 14, of the fatalities have occurred at a rapid within the Lower Yough known as Dimple Rock. Dimple refers to both the Class III rapid by that name, as well as an undercut rock in the middle of the rapid by that name. Some of the deaths were attributed to preexisting health conditions, with 9 of the 14 being caused by the rock.

The Youghiogheny is also known for fishing, having brown and rainbow trout, as well as smallmouth above the power plant discharge. Part of the Great Allegheny Passage, a multi-use trail along the former Western Maryland Railway right-of-way, extends from Pittsburgh to Confluence. From Confluence, it connects to Washington, D.C. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;, an overnight train connecting Chicago and Washington D.C., follows the Youghiogheny through southwest Pennsylvania into western Maryland, one of the most scenic stretches of Amtrak&#x27;s national system, crossing from side to side of the river in several places.

The Great Crossings is the place on the river where General George Washington and General Edward Braddock forded the river in 1755, during the French and Indian War.

<doc id="696705" wikidata="Q65565" url="?curid=696705" title="Rudolf Roessler">
<text>Rudolf Roessler (German: &quot;Rößler&quot;; 22 November 1897 – 11 December 1958) was a Protestant German and a dedicated anti-Nazi. During the interwar period, Roessler was a lively cultural journalist, with a focus on theatre. In 1934, Roessler became stateless by Germany and as a political refugee, moved to Lucerne in Switzerland. There he established a small anti-Nazi publishing firm in Lucerne known as &quot;Vita Nova&quot; that published &quot;Exilliteratur&quot; by fellow exiled writers. Late in the summer of 1942, Roessler ran the Lucy spy ring, an anti-Nazi espionage operation that was part of the Red Three while working for Rachel Dübendorfer through the cut-out . Roessler was able to provide a great quantity of high-quality intelligence, around 12,000 typed pages, sourced from the German High Command of planned operations on the Eastern Front, usually within a day of operational decisions being made. Later in the war, Roessler was able to provide the Soviet Union with intelligence on the V-1 and V-2 missiles. During the Cold War, Roessler reactivated his network and he spied on NATO countries in Western Europe under orders from the military intelligence services of the Czechoslovak Republic, until he was arrested by the Swiss authorities and convicted of espionage in 1953.

== Early life ==
Roessler was born on 22 November 1897 in Kaufbeuren, Kingdom of Bavaria. His father was Lutheran Bavarian Forestry official Georg Roessler and his mother was Sophie née Kleemann. He was the youngest of five children. Roessler graduated from in Augsburg at the age of 17.

==Military career==
When he was eighteen, Roessler was drafted into the 120th (2nd Württemberg) Infantry &quot;Emperor William, King of Prussia&quot; regiment of the Imperial German Army in Ulm in 1916. On 28 April 1916, he was convicted following court martial under German military law of going AWOL from his unit and sentenced to 5 months and 15 days in military prison; an appeal against this was unsuccessful. Roessler was pardoned to serve at the front on 15 July. First he was commanded to the Battle of the Somme, one of the most costly battles of World War I on the Western Front. After the failed British breakthrough attempts came to an end, Roessler took part in trench warfare on the slightly dented German front from 27 November to 21 December. After serving at the front, he developed a lengthy stomach and intestinal illness near Arras and was admitted to the Denain and Tegel hospitals for treatment.

From 25 May to 12 July 1917, Roessler&#x27;s unit was deployed to an area south of Ypres, that was under continuous British artillery bombardment from 21 May to 7 June. From 20 July to 10 August 1917 the unit was located in the Upper Alsace. Roessler then fought in the Third Battle of Ypres from 19 August to 10 September 1917. From 11 September to 12 November, Roessler took part in the fighting along the Hindenburg Line. On 13 November, his unit moved north. There he was removed from fighting near Hooglede on 6 December and taken to a hospital near Deinze. In January and February 1918, Roessler fought in the trenches in Flanders. His stomach and intestinal disease had not healed and he was admitted to a military hospital in Ghent on 28 February 1918, recuperating for more than a month. On 15 March 1919, he was discharged from the army.

Roessler was left with a lasting negative opinion of how the war was fought in 1916 and 1917 and the methods with which the lives of frontline soldiers were being wasted for the survival of what he increasingly saw as a power-hungry elite.

==Civilian career==
After the end of the war, he studied theology in Augsburg. Roessler, a liberal conservative, became a pacifist and eventually an opponent of Nazism. He started working as a trainee journalist at the &quot;&quot;, a German daily newspaper which was one of the most important Catholic newspapers in Germany until it was banned by the Nazis in 1935. In 1922, Roessler founded the &quot;Augsburger Literary Society&quot; along with Bertold Brecht and others and became its chairman. Many prominent writers joined the society including Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Stefan Zweig, Hermann Graf Keyserling and Fedor Stepun. In the same year he was promoted to editor, a position he held for a year.

In 1924, Roessler moved to work at the &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, a daily newspaper printed in Bavaria as a correspondent in Augsburg. From 1925, Roessler contributed copy to the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;, the Kölnische Zeitung and the &quot;Vossische Zeitung&quot; newspapers. From 1925 to 1927, he was editor of &quot;Form und Sinn&quot; (&quot;Form and Sense&quot;), a journal for art and intellectual life. Hans Carossa and Hermann Hesse published articles in this short-lived journal. On 15 July 1926, in an essay entitled &quot;Das Glaubensbekenntnis der Dichter&quot; (The Poets&#x27; Creed), Roessler himself approvingly reviewed the recently published work &quot;Das Gute&quot; (The Good) by the then well-known Basel philosopher Paul Häberlin. In it, Häberlin asserted the unity of goodness, beauty and truth in God&#x27;s creation. Roessler adopted this point of view.

== Stage People&#x27;s Association ==

In 1927, Roessler became associated with the Christian-conservative &quot;&quot; (Stage People&#x27;s Association) in Berlin, which from 1919 to 1933 attempted to increase the number of people attending theatre, to ensure the advancement of German theatre stage people. The &quot;Bühnenvolksbund&quot; wanted to revive Christian plays such as Christmas, Passion, and other mystery plays. Theatres were to be encouraged to include such plays in their repertoires. However, these efforts were never successful as membership fees, even when combined with state subsidies, were insufficient to enable the organisation to maintain a stable financial position.

In 1928, Roessler became executive director and a playwright for the association, as well as head of the &quot;Bühnenvolksbund&quot; publishing house. For the next two years, Roessler edited the magazines &quot;Form und Sinn&quot; and, from August 1932, the &quot;Deutsche Bühnenblätter&quot;, a theatre magazine, and was co-editor of the Bühnenvolksbund &quot;Das Nationaltheater&quot; (&quot;The National theatre&quot;, a magazine). In 1930, he co-wrote &quot;Thespis : das Theaterbuch&quot; (&quot;Thespis: the Theatre Book&quot;), which summarised theatre production in Germany from 1924 to 1929, with German art historian , German writer Walter Hollander, and Austro-German writer, poet, and art critic Theodor Däubler. Roessler was also chairman of the supervisory board of the stage companies Südwestdeutsche Bühne GmbH Frankfurt, Schlesische Bühne GmbH Breslau, and Ostpreußische Bühne GmbH Königsberg.

==Impeachment and expulsion==
In 1932, the Militant League for German Culture (Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur, KfdK) began to found its own theatre visitors&#x27; association and to persuade at least some of the middle-class members of the Stage People&#x27;s Association to join the Nazi association. Roessler opposed the ethnic politicization of theatre and the attempt to subordinate art to mass taste. Rather, he believed that art should influence mass taste. From the KfdK&#x27;s point of view, this was an arrogant liberal and conservative idea. After the Reichstag elections on 5 March 1933, the Nazis quickly began to dissolve the Stage People&#x27;s Association and transfer the local groups and their members and the regional associations into the ethnic &quot;Reich Association of the German Stage&quot; (Reichsverband Deutsche Bühne). The Stage People&#x27;s Association at the Reich level was to be dissolved.

On 5 May 1933, the chairman of the KfdK, Hans Hinkel, who later became the third managing director of the Reich Chamber of Culture, placed Roessler on leave and prohibited him from continuing to exercise his directorship, effectively expelling him. On 8 May, the KfdK took over Roessler&#x27;s desk. Roessler and Brünker (Roesslers deputy) fought for an interim injunction against the removal before the Berlin district court. The Prussian Prime Minister Hermann Göring then told the press that he would no longer tolerate the KfdK&#x27;s attacks but would punish them. The KfdK actually brought back the furniture that had been taken away. However, he later withdrew the financial assets of the Stage People&#x27;s Association, which were essentially funded by members&#x27; contributions.

As a result, the Stage People&#x27;s Association became insolvent and the ethnic Reichsverband Deutsche Bühne e.V filed an application with the Mitte district court on 29 May 1933 to open bankruptcy proceedings because of an outstanding invoice from a typewriter supplier in the amount of 1,170 RM. On 15 June 1933, bankruptcy proceedings were opened and from then on, Roessler was without income. In 1934, an investigation was initiated against Roessler and the Sturmabteilung appeared to search his office. In May 1934, Roessler left Germany as a political refugee and emigrated to Lucerne Switzerland with his wife Olga, with the help of his friend, the Swiss librarian and Marxist Xaver Schnieper, who Roessler had met during his studies in drama in Germany.

==Vita Nova==

In January 1934 and while still in Berlin, he co-founded the &quot;Vita Nova Verlag&quot; (&quot;New Life Publisher&quot;) publishing house at 36 Fluhmattstrasse in Lucerne, Switzerland along with the Catholic bookseller Josef Stocker and the business women Henriette Racine. Stocker had been encouraged to help co-found the publishing firm by Jesuit priest and theological philosopher Otto Karrer, with the introductions arranged by Schnieper. Vita Nova was an anti-Nazi publishing house that primarily published German writers in exile. The company published some fifty brochures and books that attacked both Nazism and Stalinism, contrasting them with the Christian values of the &quot;older&quot; Germany and Russia. The small firm also published works that were critical of Francoist Spain. Indeed, the firm provided the only real publishing house in Western Europe for exiled Christian, Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox writers and playwrights to publish their work. Amongst the most notable were Russian religious philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, Catholic philosopher Emmanuel Mounier and the German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster.

Roessler used the pseudonym, &quot;R. A. Hermes” to publish his own work at Vita Nova. From 1940 to 1941, Roessler wrote and published a 94-page memorandum using his Hermes pseudonym that was titled &quot;Die Kriegsschauplätze und die Bedingungen der Kriegführung&quot; (Memorandum on the war situation after the Battle of Britain) that discussed how partisans forces needed to be formed in countries that had been conquered, otherwise the country had to be dominated by forces in place. He described how Germany would fail to take this lesson into account, particularly in Poland and the Soviet Union, where the campaigns would be designed as a war of annihilation between two races and two world views.

==Expatriation==
On 20 May 1935, the German consulate in Basel refused to issue Roessler with a new passport and he was informed privately that he was being deported, i.e. made stateless. The Nazi regime finally revoked his German citizenship in 1937. The expatriation of Roessler and his wife was officially announced in the German newspaper, No. 96 of 28 April 1937. The reason the consulate provided for the decision was that Roessler had violated loyalty to the Reich and the people and damaged German interests. In 1940, Roessler managed to obtain a Czechoslovakian passport for himself and his wife, which was issued to him by the consulate in Marseille of the no longer existing Czechoslovak Republic. In the event of a German occupation of Switzerland, he wanted to make it possible for him to leave the country.

From 1936 to 1939, Roessler worked on the semi-monthly left-wing Catholic and radically democratic journal &quot;Die Entscheidung&quot; (The Decision) that was published by Xaver Schnieper. The editors were Xaver Schnieper, the Nidwalden architect and later intelligence officer Arnold Stöckli and the lawyers Hans de Segesser-Brunegg, along with Bernhard Mayr von Baldegg with whom Roessler met regularly in private. After 1939, the editors were called up for active military service, so the publication stopped. Here Roessler published his own work using the &quot;Arbiter” pseudonym.

==World War II==
===Büro Ha===

In April 1939, Roessler&#x27;s friend Schnieper met the photo dealer Hans Hausamann while on vacation in Lugano. Hausamann ran a press service and specialised in military intelligence from 1935 onwards. Schnieper shared his political views, so Hausamann asked him to find him an employee. Schnieper suggested his university friend Franz Wallner, who was able to fulfill the intelligence service tasks assigned to him. Hausamann therefore asked Schnieper to find another employee who was familiar with conditions in Germany and would be a reliable informant. Schnieper suggested his friend Roessler. Roessler anticipated that the Nazis would soon launch a military attack on Switzerland and therefore agreed to work with Hausamann. but only on the condition that the offer was official. At that time, Schnieper was working as a junior officer in the Swiss military intelligence agency &quot;Büro Ha&quot;, at the time located near Teufen, and he introduced Roessler to Major Hausamann. However, he avoided meeting with him personally, so Hausamann used Franz Wallner, who lived in Lucerne, as an intermediary. From the summer of 1939 to May 1944, he sent him 80-130 individual reports per month but Hausamann did not pass on any information to Roessler. Roessler became one of the most important sources of intelligence for &quot;Büro Ha&quot;.

===Rote Drei===
Another recipient of Roessler&#x27;s messages and analyses was Soviet military intelligence-agent Alexander Radó, who ran a Soviet espionage network in Switzerland that was section of the so-called Red Orchestra. In Germany it was known as the Rote Drei.

Roessler was recruited into the espionage network by Soviet agents and Rachel Dübendorfer via . Schneider, an economist, became an editor at the Gladbecker Zeitung newspaper after completing his studies. In 1926, he was selected from 230 applicants as a translator at the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Geneva. He remained there until the end of his employment in 1939, when the ILO laid off staff because its importance had declined, resulting in Schneider becoming unemployed. At the same time, Roessler placed an advertisement in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung looking for a publisher who could also work in French-speaking Switzerland and on 17 July 1939 Schneider was hired. Schneider began to set up a branch of the publishing house in Geneva. Roessler and Schneider had similar political views and got on well, which resulted in Roessler telling Schneider of the reports he was receiving.

Schneider was friends with Dübendorfer (who also worked at the ILO), and her partner Paul Böttcher. Böttcher was a communist and former finance minister of Saxony and lived in Switzerland under the name Dübendorfer. Like Roessler, whom he did not know personally, Böttcher provided Radó with intelligence. At a dinner together around June 1941, Schneider showed Böttcher one of Roessler&#x27;s reports.

About a year later, Böttcher told Schneider that a report by Roessler would be of great strategic interest to Soviet intelligence and asked Schneider if Roessler would be prepared to pass the intelligence to him on a regular basis. Roessler agreed and from the summer of 1942 to 1944 gave Schneider the typed sheets, who couriered them to Dübendorfer. Schneider received no payment from either of the recipients for his transmission services, only reimbursement for the costs of the railroad.

===The role of Karel Sedláček===
In June 1937, Karel Sedláček, a German speaking Czech intelligence officer, worked undercover as Karl Seltzinger in Zurich as correspondent for the Prague-based newspaper Národní listy. By the autumn of 1938, Sedlacek was friends with Hans Hausamann and receiving intelligence reports from him. In the spring of 1939, Sedláček moved to Lucerne where he met Roessler and through their common journalistic background, cultivated him. In September 1939, Sedláček began transmitting intelligence to František Moravec of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London and continued over a period of three years.

===Battle of Kursk and Operation Citadel===
In early March 1943, Hitler planned a massive offensive against the Kursk salient known as Operation Citadel in the hope of regaining the initiative in the east. On 15 April 1943, Hitler signed Order Number 6 to begin the offensive. Within 24 hours Alexander Foote had informed Soviet intelligence. On the 3 April 1943, a message stated: The Wehrmacht&#x27;s attack on Kursk is to be postponed until the beginning of May 1943 because increasingly stronger Soviet forces are being massed on the northern sector of the front, especially in Velikiye Luki. This report was true because Order No. 6 of the OKH ordered May 3 as the earliest date of attack. On 20 April 1943 a message stated the attack on Kursk is postponed to 12 June 1943. This order was not signed until 29 April 1943. The attack was later postponed again and began on 5 July 1943.

In at least almost 70 cases, Sándor Radó forwarded significant messages from Roessler to Soviet intelligence. Roessler&#x27;s intelligence wasn&#x27;t only strategic in nature; he also supplied the Soviets with detailed information on the new German Panther tank.

===Remuneration===
Roessler was particularly mercenary in his approach. At the beginning of 1942, Roessler complained to Bernhard Mayr von Baldegg, who was an officer in the Swiss general staff at the time, staff officer to Max Waibel, in command of Noehrichtenstelle I of the 5th Signals in Lucerne, that he found the work for Hausamann boring. Waibel decided to keep him interested by paying him 250 Swiss francs per month, which later increased to 400 francs as the war progressed. Büro Ha also paid him 1000 francs per month which was raised to 2000 francs per month as the war progressed. Roessler was also paid by Soviet intelligence, initially receiving 700 Swiss francs per month, increasing to 3000 francs per month as the war progressed. The following are some examples of captured radio messages that detail Roessler&#x27;s mercenary nature:

::* 12.3.1943 . . . Agree to buy Plan Ostwall for 5000 francs. Does Lucy know whether these documents are genuine and reliable?
::* 10. and 11.11.1943 . . . Sissy states that Lucy group no longer works when the salary stops.
::* 14.11.1943 . . . Please tell Lucy in our name that ... his group will surely be paid according to his demands. We are ready to reward him richly for his information.
::* 9.12.1943 ... Inform Lucy not to worry about the money situation.

===Roessler&#x27;s Sources in World War II===
The record of messages transmitted show that Roessler had four important sources. It was never discovered who they were. The four sources whose codenames were &quot;Werther&quot;, &quot;Teddy&quot;, &quot;Olga&quot;, and &quot;Anna&quot; were responsible for 42.5 percent of the intelligence sent from Switzerland to the Soviet Union.

The search for the identity of those sources has created a very large body of work of varying quality and offering various conclusions. Several theories can be dismissed immediately, including by Foote and several other writers, that the code names reflected the sources&#x27; access type rather than their identity- for example, that Werther stood for Wehrmacht, Olga for Oberkommando der Luftwaffe, Anna for Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office)- as the evidence does not support it. Alexander Radó made this claim in his memoirs, that were examined in a Der Spiegel article that comprehensively debunked the claim as false. Three and a half years before his death, Roessler described the identity of the four sources to a confidant. They were a German major who was in charge of the Abwehr before Wilhelm Canaris, Hans Bernd Gisevius, Carl Goerdeler and a General Boelitz, who was then deceased.

The most reliable study by the CIA Historical Review Program concluded that of the four sources, the most important source was &quot;Werther&quot;. The study stated he was likely Wehrmacht General Hans Oster, other Abwehr officers working with Swiss intelligence, or Swiss intelligence on its own. There was no evidence to link the other three codenames to known individuals. The CIA believed that the German sources gave their reports to Swiss General Staff, who in turn supplied Roessler with information that the Swiss wanted to pass to the Soviets.

===Transmission channels===
There are least two theories on how Roessler received his reports in Switzerland.

In the first earlier theory, Roessler received his reports via radio transmission that were encrypted with the Enigma rotor cipher machine. This theory is supported by Jörgensen, Accoce, Quet, along with Tarrant In Berlin, Roessler was a member of the &quot;Herren Klub&quot;, a prestigious gentleman&#x27;s club, where he met senior officers from the German military, many who would later become his contacts within Germany and assist with the disclosure of classified information. On 30 May 1938 in Lucerne, Roessler was visited by two of his contacts, the German generals Fritz Thiele and Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, who would eventually become the officer in charge of the intelligence department of Army Group Centre in the Eastern Front. Roessler was provided with an Enigma machine and the latest shortwave transmitter and told to start listening for messages from Thiele who was stationed in the Bendlerblock. The messages were sent using the call-sign &quot;RAHS&quot;. A typical day for Roessler was to receive transmissions via the Broadcasting Center during his work day, and rebroadcast that information to the Russian military after leaving work for the evening. In this theory, Roessler was trained by Schneider on how to use the Enigma and the radio transmitter. This thesis was comprehensively contradicted by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; magazine on 15 January 1967 article &quot;Verräter im Führerhauptquartier&quot;.

The second newer and simpler theory is described by Kamber who believes that the messages from Roessler&#x27;s sources from the German Reich were sent via telephone and telex lines to the Milan reporting center. From there, they were forwarded to Switzerland by a courier. These were documents that arrived at Lucerne railroad station via the Chiasso border station by Swiss Post mail train at 11:30 in the evening. Roessler collected them there almost daily. Stöckli who was friends with Roessler from when he first moved to Lucerne, had told two authors, Lutz Mahlerwein and Adalbert Wiemer of a historical TV programme &quot;Dora an Direktor: der Angriff steht bevor&quot; on 18 July 1989, that the reports had come by postal train to Milan. The TV programme details had been recorded by the Stasi and archived.

===End of operations===
On 12 December 1941, the Abwehr discovered Leopold Trepper&#x27;s espionage network in Belgium and gave it the moniker &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot;. On 9 November 1942, Anatoly Gurevich was arrested and during interogration he exposed the existence of the Swiss network to the &quot;Abwehr&quot;. Hans Peter, the lover of Margrit Bolli was actually a German agent, and according to one source stole an unencrypted message that had been left in Bolli&#x27;s apartment when she moved apartment, as early as 16 March 1943 and passed it to German intelligence, who used it to decrypt Rote Drei radio communications.

In the summer of 1943, Heinz Pannwitz of the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle despatched the German Jew Ewald Zweig with the cover name Yves Rameau to Switzerland with the intention of penetrating Radó&#x27;s network. Zweig passed on details of what he learned about the network to the Swiss Federal Police.

Swiss defensive neutrality was important to the Swiss people, particularly in foreign policy that had passed from a political doctrine to tradition and had existed for centuries. There were also genuine fears that Switzerland would have been encircled after the Italian armistice. When the Swiss were informed of the existence of the network, they immediately began searching for it on 9 September 1943. On 11 September 1943, a Swiss Army radio counterintelligence company notified the Federal Police that radio signals from the Geneva area could be detected, which resulted in the arrest of radio operator Margrit Bolli along with Edmond and Olga Hamel on the night 13 October 1943.

===Wartime arrest===

After Hamel and Bolli were arrested, Roessler feared that he would also be investigated and that his informants in the German Reich would be endangered. He asked Mayr von Baldegg, the deputy head of Noehrichtenstelle I, to intervene on behalf of Hamel and Christian Schneider. Mayr von Baldegg presented the request to the head of the intelligence office, but left it at that. Until the arrest of Dübendorfer and Böttcher, the federal police were not aware of Roessler&#x27;s reports. Radó suspected that Christian Schneider told the federal police that the reports came from Roessler. On 19 May 1944, the federal police arrested Roessler, the cutout Schneider, the courier Tamara Vigier and Mayr von Baldegg. This ended Roessler&#x27;s intelligence activities not only for Soviet intelligence, but also for the Büro Ha and the Swiss General Staff.

Roger Masson, head of the intelligence section of the Swiss army staff, was not interested in the intelligence activities of their informant Roessler becoming known to a wider group of people. He could have tried to have the investigation closed. However, he decided not do this. Instead he sent Roessler to prison for his own safety, as Masson feared that the German Sicherheitsdienst would attempt to kidnap Roessler.

On 6 September 1944, Roessler was released from prison. The main hearing against him and Schneider in the criminal case took place after the end of the war, in 22–23 October 1945, before a military court. Noehrichtenstelle I placed one of its officers as a defense attorney. The division court considered it criminal that Roessler and Schneider also passed on information in reports to Soviet intelligence that the Swiss authorities had determined through interrogations of deserters. The divisional court found Roessler and Schneider guilty, but nevertheless refrained from imposing a penalty because both had rendered great service to Switzerland. Roessler did not reveal the names of his German and Swiss informants either in the preliminary investigation or in the main proceedings On 22–23 October 1945, the Swiss military court sentenced each to two years.

===Summary===
During his spy career, Roessler provided intelligence to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, at the minimum. He was often able to deliver accurate intelligence within one day of the orders being issued. For instance, a German army commander found a copy of his own orders in the Red Army headquarters building in the Polish town of Łomża when his unit occupied it after wresting it from the Russians. This was reported to the German high command, yet they were unable to find the leak.

==After World War II==

===Cold War===
In 1945, shortly after the end of the war, Karel Sedláček, who had regular contact with Hans Hausamann and was now the Czechoslovak Military Attaché in Bern, visited Xaver Schnieper, whom he knew and who was a friend of Roessler. In 1947, Sedláček who then held the rank of lieutenant colonel, introduced his successor Kopačka and his secretary, Captain Volf to Schnieper to Roessler. Volf arranged with Schnieper to request Roessler to reactivate his wartime &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot; spy ring. Sedlacek knew Schnieper well and he also knew that both Schnieper and Roessler as freelance journalists would be struggling to make ends meet. Roessler, by virtue of his wartime reputation, was given a sweeping brief. He was told to report all military and air force matters in Western Europe, the U.K., and Spain under Franco, and in particular to concentrate on infiltrating the United States military and report on intelligence operations in Western Europe. Roessler agreed and provided the requested reports. Schnieper wrote the reports up on his typewriter and handed it to Volf. Roessler received 500 to 1,000 francs per bundle. On 25 February 1948, after the Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état, contact between Volf and Roessler broke off.

There was no contact between Czech intelligence and Roessler until July 1950 when a contact &quot;Konrad&quot; approached Schnieper and asked him to reactivate the operation and send future reports on microfilm to two Prague addresses. He was paid a signing bonus of 3,000 francs. Roessler and Schnieper received almost 50,000 francs for the work. Roessler developed his reports largely from newspaper clippings and other previously published material. He collected, compared and checked the news for contradictions and placed them in a larger context.

Between 10 and 21 June and 7–27 September 1952, Roessler visited Germany and obtained information about the US Army stationed there. The renewed intelligence activity was noticed when a package sent to Germany on 3 January 1953 was returned. Customs opened it and found a honey jar with a capsule that contained microfilm. When the microfilm was examined, it was found to contain news about the airfields and the headquarters of the British Royal Air Force, about the rebuilding of the West German aviation industry, about U.S. bases, the German Air Force in Jutland and the operational strength of the French Army.

===Arrest===
On 9 March 1953, Roessler was arrested. During the investigation, Roessler testified that he had to secure his livelihood as his publishing company, Vita Nova Verlag was no longer profitable. Business remained satisfactory until 1948 because the publisher was able to sell existing books after the end of the war. However, after 1948, sales declined. Roessler trial was held on 2 November 1953, where he was charged with spying on West Germany for Communist Czechoslovakia. He was sentenced to twenty-one months in prison, minus the time he spent in detention awaiting the trial. Roessler was imprisoned for 12 months and released in early 1954. Xaver Schnieper who was charged with Roessler, was imprisoned for nine months in prison.

===Freelance journalist===
After he was released from jail, Roessler spent his last years living quietly in Kriens. He continued to write. His articles, which were unsigned, appeared in the Lucerne daily newspaper, the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland, &quot;Freie Innerschweiz&quot;.

Roessler continued to argue against West German rearmament and for international solidarity. The articles can be split into two categories.The first category was short articles of one to two pages, that focused on a part of a larger topic. The second and more important were articles on specific areas of interest, that ran to four or five pages and covered subjects within economic, social, colonial and security policy. These bigger articles often contained a number of abbreviations that were subject to change, so it was not possible for the reader to determine who the author was. Roessler was disillusioned with the Cold War, particularly after his trial, particularly when he was accused of spying in favour of the Soviet Union. Therefore, his work at the newspaper was not formally recognised. Even his obituary failed to mention his work there.

Roessler was not a Social Democrat, so it was difficult to determine how his political analysis was affected by his articles being published in a social-democratic daily newspaper, as other sources on his life, politics and cultural outlook have so far been lacking. In a telephone call to the Freie Innerschweiz on 29 May 1991, his friend, Xaver Schnieper confirmed that Roessler would certainly not have written anything that contradicted his own opinion.

Roessler was committed to the socially disadvantaged, combined with a criticism of the idea that technology and armament were the only way to a better world. He had aversion to the hysteria of the Cold War and its associated militarism that made him appear more left-wing today than many social democrats at the time.

===Missing honours===
In 1967, the leadership of Soviet military intelligence proposed that Roessler, along with other Soviet military intelligence informants, be honoured posthumously with an award. But the GDR Minister for State Security Erich Mielke objected and the plan was abandoned. The possible motive is that Roessler rejected dialectical and historical materialism.

==Analysis==
There are a number of sources that claim that the Rote Drei was functioning before the war and that Roessler, as Lucy, sent information to the Soviets that provided advanced warning of Hitler&#x27;s impending attack on Russia. However, an examination of the radio messages that were transmitted by the group, proves that Rachel Dübendorfer did not form a clandestine relationship with Roessler until the late summer of 1942.

Roessler&#x27;s value to the Rote Drei and the Soviets derived entirely from his sources in Germany. This context is probably misleading, as the CIA believed that the German sources gave their intelligence to Swiss General Staff, who in turn supplied Roessler with information that the Swiss wanted to pass to the Soviets.

<text>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an American nonprofit organization devoted to the Python programming language, launched on March 6, 2001. The mission of the foundation is to foster development of the Python community and is responsible for various processes within the Python community, including developing the core Python distribution, managing intellectual rights, developer conferences including the Python Conference (PyCon), and raising funds.

In 2005, the Python Software Foundation received the &quot;Computerworld&quot; Horizon Award for &quot;cutting-edge&quot; technology.

== Overview ==
The PSF focuses on empowering and supporting people within the Python community with grant programs that support sprints, conferences, meetups, user groups, and Python development. The PSF runs Python Conference (PyCon) US, the leading Python community conference. The PSF is the primary point of contact for organizations that wish to work with Python, to support Python, or sponsor Python development. The PSF provides a structure by which work, donations, and sponsorships are coordinated worldwide. The PSF also possesses and protects intellectual property associated with Python and the Python community, such as the word &quot;Python,&quot; the two-snakes logo, and the terms &quot;PyLadies&quot; and &quot;PyCon.&quot;

== Membership ==
There are five tiers of membership within the PSF. These tiers include:
# Basic members – Basic members are individuals or entities who are part of the Python language community and who have decided to declare their support for Python and agree to the community Code of Conduct.
# Supporting members – Supporting members make an annual donation to the PSF to sustain the foundation and support the Python community. Supporting members are eligible to vote.
# Managing members – Managing members are people who commit to working at least five hours per month to support the Python ecosystem, by organizing Python events, managing or contributing to PSF projects, running infrastructure, participating in one of the PSF&#x27;s working groups, etc. Managing members are eligible to vote.
# Contributing members – Contributing members are people who dedicate at least five hours per month working on projects that advance the mission of the PSF, where the work relates to the creation or maintenance of open source software available to the public at no charge. Contributing members are eligible to vote.
# Fellows – Fellows are members who have been nominated by their extraordinary efforts and impact upon Python, the community, and the broader Python ecosystem. Fellows are nominated from the broader community and elevated by a vote of the members. Fellow members are eligible to vote.

== Code of Conduct ==
Since late 2012, the Python Software Foundation started recommending that all Python conferences create and apply a code of conduct. This is mandatory to any event to be granted funds by the Python Software Foundation.

<doc id="696727" wikidata="Q476044" url="?curid=696727" title="Alexander Foote">
<text>Alexander Allan Foote (13 April 1905 – 1 August 1956) was a radio operator for a Soviet espionage ring in Switzerland during World War II. Foote was born in Liverpool and raised mostly in Yorkshire by his Scottish-born father and English mother.

== Life ==
Foote completed his education at sixteen and, after working in different professions, joined the Royal Air Force in 1935. However, he deserted while serving at Gosport Barracks on 23 December 1936.

Following his desertion he sailed for Spain and served with the British Battalion of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War for two years. 

Serving with the rank of Sergeant, Foote was appointed transport officer and batman to Fred Copeman. 

He decided to continue his efforts against Fascism (and, perhaps, for Communism) and volunteered for clandestine work with Red Orchestra. He was put into contact with Ursula Kuczynski in Switzerland. He became a radio operator for the Soviet espionage operation run by Alexander Radó and was one of those who passed information to Moscow from the Lucy spy ring run by Rudolf Roessler. Foote was one of those arrested when the Swiss police shut down most of the operation and was detained for a time.

After the War, he spent some time in the Eastern Bloc and then returned to the West and published his book, &quot;A Handbook for Spies&quot;. He died in 1956.

== Espionage ==
Because of the implausible veracity of the intelligence (fast, plentiful, and accurate) and never explained source of the Lucy Ring&#x27;s information, suspicion attaches to all those associated with it. Since Foote, as the Lucy Ring&#x27;s radio operator, was a central cog in the chain of supply and therefore in a position to know much, his subsequent account has been thought to be rather dubious in places. This, and the fact that he seemingly managed to return to the West rather easily, has led some to suggest Foote was a British Secret Service double agent and one conduit (perhaps even the main one) of intelligence from Britain to Roessler and thence to Moscow.

According to various sources, Foote was indeed a MI6 (SIS) double agent unbeknownst to Radó. After the destruction of Radó&#x27;s network and his escape from Switzerland, Radó met Foote in Paris and both were ordered to return to Moscow immediately. They took off aboard a Russian military aeroplane on 6 January 1945, taking a circuitous route (the war being still in progress) via Egypt. Their plane landed to refuel in Cairo, whereupon Radó defected. Continuing alone to Moscow, Foote was subjected to intensive interrogation in an attempt to determine his loyalty and the possibility of his being a penetration agent. Foote was confronted with an instance of disinformation sent from his transmitter in May 1942 and told &quot;That message cost us 100 000 men at Kharkov and resulted in the Germans reaching Stalingrad&quot;. Foote said that he merely passed on what he received from Radó. Satisfied with Foote&#x27;s explanation, the Soviets gave Foote a false identity under the alias of Major Granatov. Posing as a German, Albert Müller, he inserted himself into postwar Berlin to establish this alias with the aim of being sent by the Moscow Centre to Argentina, to attempt to identify and infiltrate groups of escaped high-ranking Nazis.

Journalist, broadcaster and author Malcolm Muggeridge, himself a wartime MI6 officer, &quot;got to know Foote after the war&quot; (pp 207–08) when Foote paid Muggeridge &quot;regular visits&quot; at his flat near Regent&#x27;s Park, London. Foote at this time was working as a clerk in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, work he found, according to Muggeridge, &quot;very tedious&quot;. Muggeridge is firmly of the opinion that the information Foote sent &quot;could only, in fact, have come from Bletchley&quot;.

In March 1947, following the defection of a Soviet agent who had been involved with British Intelligence, Foote&#x27;s allegiance to the British may have been confirmed. Foote himself defected from his Russian control in Berlin, escaping to the British sector.

<text>Richard Vincent Campagna (born May 5, 1952) of Iowa City, Iowa is an American political figure who was the vice-presidential running mate of Michael Badnarik of the Libertarian Party in the 2004 U.S. presidential election.

== Early life, education, and career ==
Richard Campagna is from New York City, and grew up in the Midwood section of Brooklyn.

Campagna has degrees from Brown University (BA), New York University (MA), St. John&#x27;s University (JD), and Columbia University (MA), and a PhD. After completing his undergraduate degree from Brown University, where he majored in political science, he enrolled at both St. John&#x27;s University School of Law and New York University for a master&#x27;s in Latin American Studies.

In the mid-1970s, he practiced in Caracas, Venezuela and Paris, France with companies like Ford and Schlumberger, Ltd. In the roles of Latin American counsel and international counsel for the latter. He oversaw legal operations in approximately 190 countries. After returning to the United States in the early 1980s, he worked as lead counsel for the Motion Picture Association under movie mogul Jack Valenti. Richard then served as general counsel for Fairchild Camera and Instruments in Mountain View, California before they headed back east to New York City in the mid 1980&#x27;s. He and his wife, also an attorney, started their own international legal consulting firm in the early-1990s, and Richard also wrote and published travel books during this time.

He is a consultant in a range of fields, including psychological counseling, legal advisement, teaching, interpretation, and stress management consulting. Richard also participated on the Columbia University&#x27;s Alumni Council.

In mid-2003, Campagna became the first candidate to enter the race for the Libertarian Party&#x27;s vice-presidential nomination (the Libertarian party chooses its presidential and vice-presidential nominees in the convention on separate ballots). He defeated his closest competitor, Missouri libertarian Tamara Millay, on the first ballot at the May 2004 Libertarian National Convention, which selected Michael Badnarik as the Libertarian Party presidential nominee. The ticket of Badnarik and Campagna placed fourth in the 2004 presidential election, receiving just under 400,000 votes nationwide and no electoral votes.
