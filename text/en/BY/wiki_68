<text>&quot;A Time for Choosing&quot;, also known as &quot;The Speech&quot;, was a speech presented during the 1964 U.S. presidential election campaign by future president Ronald Reagan on behalf of Republican candidate Barry Goldwater. &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot; launched Reagan into national prominence in politics.

==Background==
Many versions of this speech exist since it was altered over many weeks. Contrary to popular belief, however, the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, California as a nomination speech for presidential candidate Barry Goldwater; Everett Dirksen gave that nomination speech, while Richard Nixon introduced Goldwater prior to his acceptance speech. Reagan, though he campaigned for Goldwater, did not use &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot; until October 27, 1964, when it was part of a pre-recorded television program, &quot;Rendezvous with Destiny&quot; (the title of the program was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt in his June 27, 1936 speech to the 1936 Democratic National Convention). In his autobiography, &quot;An American Life&quot;, Reagan recalled going to bed that night &quot;hoping I hadn&#x27;t let Barry down.&quot;

Speaking for Goldwater, Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In the speech, Reagan revealed his ideological motivation: &quot;The Founding Fathers knew a government can&#x27;t control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.&quot; He also said, &quot;You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man&#x27;s age-old dream – the maximum of individual freedom consistent with law and order – or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.&quot; The speech raised $1 million for Goldwater&#x27;s campaign, and is considered the event that launched Reagan&#x27;s political career.

==Aftermath and legacy==
&quot;A Time For Choosing&quot; has been considered one of the most effective speeches ever made by an eventual presidential candidate. Following &quot;A Time For Choosing&quot; in 1964, &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter David S. Broder called the speech &quot;the most successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified the 1896 Democratic Convention with his &#x27;Cross of Gold&#x27; speech.&quot; Nevertheless, Barry Goldwater lost the election by one of the largest margins in history. Soon afterward, Reagan was asked to run for Governor of California; he ran for office and won the election in 1966. When Reagan won the White House in 1980, George Will of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; referred back to &quot;A Time For Choosing&quot; and said, &quot;Goldwater won the election of 1964... it just took sixteen years to count the votes.&quot;

In 2014, Professor Steven F. Hayward, Professor of Public Policy at Pepperdine University and Reagan biographer, looked back at the speech and said, &quot;at the time, critics thought the speech was too emotional; while others thought it was too controversial. But after the speech, it was clear that Ronald Reagan and his ideas were simply irresistible.&quot;

&quot;A Time For Choosing&quot; ushered in a conservative movement in American politics at a time when the country was looking for strong leadership following President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, and while experiencing both a growing welfare state and a raging Cold War. Reagan&#x27;s speech in 1964 not only made him the leader of this movement but also earned him the nickname &quot;The Great Communicator&quot; in recognition of his effective oratory skills. Among Reagan&#x27;s admirers, &quot;A Time For Choosing&quot; is known simply as &quot;The Speech.&quot;

<text>Alexander Thom (26 March 1894 – 7 November 1985) was a Scottish engineer most famous for his theory of the Megalithic yard, categorisation of stone circles and his studies of Stonehenge and other archaeological sites.

== Life and work ==
===Early life and education===
Thom was born in Carradale in 1894 to Archibald Thom, a tenant farmer at &quot;Mains farm&quot; for Carradale House, and his wife Lily Stevenson Strang from the family of Robert Louis Stevenson. Her mother (Thom&#x27;s grandmother) belonged to a large family from Symington, upon whom had been bestowed the land by Robert the Bruce. His father trained the Church choir while his mother was pianist.

Thom spent his early years at Mains farm until moving to &quot;The Hill&quot; farm at Dunlop, Ayrshire. Instilled with a good work ethic by his father, Thom taught himself industrial engineering and entered college in Glasgow in 1911 where he studied alongside John Logie Baird. In 1912 he attended summer school at Loch Eck where he was trained in surveying and field astronomy by Dr David Clark and Professor Moncur. In 1913, aged just 19, he assisted in surveying the Canadian Pacific Rail Network.

Thom graduated from the Royal College of Science and Technology and the University of Glasgow in 1914, earning a BSc with special distinction in Engineering.

===Early academic career===
He suffered from a heart murmur and was not drafted during the First World War. Instead he went to work in civil engineering of the Forth Bridge and later designed flying boats for the Gosport Aircraft Company. In 1917 he married Jeanie Kirkwood with whom he shared a long and lively marriage.

He returned to the University of Glasgow and worked as a lecturer from 1922 to 1939, quickly earning his PhD and DSc degrees. He built his own home called &quot;Thalassa&quot; in 1922, along with a windmill to power it with electricity. His father died in 1924 and he took over running the farm where he fathered three children, Archibald, Beryl and Alan. Thom helped to develop the Department of Aeronautics at the University of Glasgow and lectured on statistics, practical field surveying, theodolite design and astronomy. From 1930 to 1935 he was a Carnegie Teaching Fellow.

During the Second World War, Thom moved to Fleet in Hampshire where he was appointed Principal Scientific Officer heading the Royal Aircraft Establishment team that developed the first high speed wind tunnel.

===Ancient engineering and the Megalithic yard===
Later, he was professor and chair of engineering science at Brasenose College, University of Oxford where he became interested in the methods that prehistoric peoples used to build megalithic monuments. Thom became especially interested in the stone circles of the British Isles and France and their astronomical associations.

Thom (1955) in which he first suggested the megalithic yard as a standardised prehistoric measurement. He retired from academia in 1961 to spend the rest of his life devoted to this area of research. The Thom Building, housing the Department of Engineering Science at Oxford, built in the 1960s, is named after Alexander Thom.

From around 1933 to 1977 Thom spent most of his weekends and holiday periods hefting theodolites and survey equipment around the countryside with his family member or friends, most notably with his son Archie. From studies measuring and analysing the data created at over five hundred megalithic sites, he attempted to classify stone circles into different morphological types, Type A, Type B, Type B modified, and Type D flattened circles, Type 1 and Type 2 eggs, ovals and true circles.

His son Alan died in a plane crash in 1945.

===Archaeoastronomical speculations===
He suggested several were built as astronomical complexes to predict eclipses via nineteen-year cycles. Thom went on to identify numerous solar and stellar alignments at stone circles, providing the foundations for the scientific discipline of archaeoastronomy.

He further suggested the prehistoric peoples of Britain must have used a solar method of keeping calendar. Based on statistical histograms of observed declinations at horizon marks with no convenient star at −22°, +8°, +9° and +22° (except possibly Spica at +9°) between 2100 and 1600 BCE, he suggested a year based on sixteen months; four with twenty two days, eleven with twenty three days, and one with twenty four.

Thom&#x27;s suggested megalithic solar year was divided by midsummer, midwinter, and the two equinoxes into four and then subdivided into eight by early versions of the modern Christian festivals of Whitsun, Lammas, Martinmas, and Candlemas (see Scottish Quarter Days). He found little evidence for further subdivision into thirty two, but noted &quot;We do not know how sophisticated prehistoric man&#x27;s calendar was, but the interesting thing is that he obtained declinations very close to those we have obtained as ideal&quot;.

Thom explored these topics further in his later books
* &quot;Megalithic Sites in Britain&quot; (Oxford, 1967)
* &quot;Megalithic Lunar Observatories&quot; (Oxford, 1971)
* &quot;Megalithic Remains in Britain and Brittany&quot; (Oxford, 1978)
The last was written with his son Archie, after they carried out a detailed survey of the Carnac stones from 1970 to 1974.

Thom&#x27;s ideas met with resistance from the archaeological community but were welcomed amongst elements of 1960s counter-culture. Along with Gerald Hawkins&#x27; new interpretation of Stonehenge as an astronomical &#x27;computer&#x27; (see Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge), Thom&#x27;s theories were adopted by numerous enthusiasts for &#x27;the lost wisdom of the ancients&#x27; and became commonly associated with pseudoscience.

===Later life===
In 1975, his wife, Jeanie died. In 1981 he underwent an eye operation and in 1982 he broke a femur falling on ice. He continued to write papers and undertook interviews and correspondence using a dictaphone with the assistance of audio typist, Hilda Gustin. He moved in with his daughter Beryl in 1983 in Banavie. Registered as blind, he concluded a final book &quot;Stone Rows and Standing Stones&quot;, a 557 page tome published posthumously with the assistance of Aubrey Burl in 1990. Thom died on 7 November 1985 at Fort William hospital, aged 91. His body was buried near Ayr.

Alexander Thom is survived by his daughter Beryl Austin, and his grandchildren. 
His son Archie survived him, but died ten years later, in 1995, from a brain tumour.

==BBC Chronicle – Cracking the Stone Age code==

In 1970, Thom appeared on a television documentary produced by the BBC &quot;Chronicle&quot; series, presented by Magnus Magnusson and featuring well-known archaeologists Dr Euan Mackie, Professor Richard J. C. Atkinson, Dr A. H. A. Hogg, Professor Stuart Piggott, Dr Jacquetta Hawkes, Dr Humphrey Case and Dr Glyn Daniel. The programme discussed the difference between orthodox archaeology and the radical ideas of Thom. A pinnacle of his career, Thom finally got to publicly deliver his message on national television. Despite the heavy criticism, he never vented his frustration on the archaeological profession; as he said in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; programme, &quot;I just keep reporting what I find.&quot;

== Later use of his work ==
Thom&#x27;s proposed length for the Megalithic yard has been reused as such in several controversial books that claim this unit of measurement is a subdivision of the Earth&#x27;s circumference in an alleged 366-degree geometry. One such book is &#x27;Civilization One: The World is Not as You Thought It Was&#x27;, by Christopher Knight and Alan Butler who propose the 366 geometry theory.

Clive Ruggles has said that both classical and Bayesian statistical reassessments of Thom&#x27;s data &quot;reached the conclusion that the evidence in favour of the MY was at best marginal, and that even if it does exist the uncertainty in our knowledge of its value is of the order of centimetres, far greater than the 1mm precision claimed by Thom. In other words, the evidence presented by Thom could be
adequately explained by, say, monuments being set out by pacing, with the &#x27;unit&#x27; reflecting an average length of pace.&quot; David George Kendall had previously argued that pacing would have created a greater difference in measurements between sites, he concluded after investigation for the Royal Academy, that &quot;The hypothesis of a smooth, non-quantal distribution of circle diameters&quot; (for Scottish, English and Welsh true circles) &quot;is thus rejected at the 1% level.&quot;

Douglas Heggie casts doubt on Thom&#x27;s suggestion as well, stating that his careful analysis uncovered &quot;little evidence for a highly accurate unit&quot; and &quot;little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use&quot;.

Euan MacKie, recognising that Thom&#x27;s theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter&#x27;s prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom&#x27;s long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site) led him to check Thom&#x27;s geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom&#x27;s conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.[22] In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom&#x27;s fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom&#x27;s claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.[23] Nevertheless, Thom&#x27;s legacy remains strong, Krupp wrote in 1979, &quot;Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeoastronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.&quot; His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.

In his book &quot;Genes, Giants, Monsters and Men,&quot; Joseph P. Farrell states, &quot;If Thom was right, the development of human civilization may have to be rewritten!&quot; This Farrell surmises is why Thom encounters such opposition from certain groups.

In his book &quot;Rings of Stone: The Prehistoric Stone Circles of Britain and Ireland.&quot; Aubrey Burl calls the megalithic yard &quot;a chimera, a grotesque statistical misconception.&quot;

<doc id="712968" wikidata="Q2731643" url="?curid=712968" title="New Warriors">
<text>The New Warriors is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They traditionally consisted of teenage and young adult heroes, and were often seen to serve as a junior counterpart to The Avengers in much the same way that the New Mutants/X-Force did with the X-Men. They made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #411 (December 1989) and made their full debut in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #412. Over the years, the New Warriors, in their various incarnations, have been featured in five different volumes of the title &quot;The New Warriors&quot;.

The New Warriors team was created by editor Tom DeFalco, who brought together existing Marvel characters Firestar, Marvel Boy, Namorita, Nova, and Speedball, and added the newly created Night Thrasher. Through the 75-issue comic series, the team fought adversaries, including the second Sphinx, the Folding Circle, and even the Fantastic Four. Over time, the team was joined by Silhouette, Rage, Hindsight Lad, Bandit, Timeslip, Dagger, Darkhawk, Powerpax, Turbo, and the Scarlet Spider.

The second volume of &quot;New Warriors&quot; was published in 1999–2000 and this team consisted of Namorita, Nova, Speedball, and Turbo, joined by new members Bolt and Aegis.

The third volume of the &quot;New Warriors&quot; was a six-issue mini-series that sees the superhero team cast as the stars of their own reality TV show. Night Thrasher, Nova, and Speedball were joined by Microbe and Debrii. The New Warriors are at the center of a televised fight against a number of super villains in Stamford, Connecticut, where Nitro explodes, killing 612 people including several members of the New Warriors. The incident was one of the sparks that led to Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover in 2006 and 2007.

The fourth &quot;New Warriors&quot; series saw Night Thrasher gather a group of former mutants and replace their lost superpowers with technology. The comic book was published from 2007 to 2009. The story reveals that Night Thrasher is the original Night Thrasher&#x27;s brother, formerly known as Bandit, who wants to travel back in time and change the events at Stamford that killed his brother. When they try to travel back in time, the team ends up in a dystopic future where the original Night Thrasher is a ruthless dictator. The New Warriors return to their own time and disband.

The fifth &quot;New Warriors&quot; series was launched as part of the &quot;All-New Marvel NOW!&quot; initiative in 2014. The story saw original New Warriors members Justice (formerly Marvel Boy), Speedball, and Silhouette return to team up with the new Nova, Scarlet Spider, Hummingbird, Sun Girl, Haechi and Water Snake.

==&quot;The New Warriors&quot; (vol. 1)==

===Fictional team history===
Dwayne Taylor, the vigilante known as Night Thrasher meticulously researches a group of young heroes to help him wage a war on crime. They are Vance Astrovik (Marvel Boy), Angelica Jones (Firestar) and Richard Rider, who at that time believed he had been depowered after quitting the Nova Corps. During their first battle with Terrax, a former herald of Galactus, they are joined by Robbie Baldwin (Speedball) and Namorita. They defeat Terrax, but the Avengers unintentionally end up taking the credit. The team decides to stay together and Speedball dubs them the New Warriors after a news report he had seen on the battle.

The newly created team gets involved in a fight between Thor and Juggernaut, helping Thor to send the Juggernaut to another dimension. In the team&#x27;s second issue Night Thrasher&#x27;s past comes back to haunt him as the brother and sister team of Midnight&#x27;s Fire and Silhouette is introduced. Next, the corporation Genetech hires the Mad Thinker to gather information on the New Warriors in order to create their own superhumans, resulting in their battle with Genetech&#x27;s team of superhumans, Psionex. The Warriors travel to stop a superhuman named Star Thief that is destroying space launches, with Firestar, Marvel Boy and Namorita ending up on the Moon with the Inhumans. The Team minus Night Thrasher travels to Brazil to rescue Speedball&#x27;s mother from an environmental terrorist group and battle the Force of Nature. Night Thrasher stays behind to patch things up with Silhouette and confronts the Punisher. Upon the Warriors return to New York, their headquarters (the Ambrose building) is trashed in a battle with the Hellions for the claim of Firestar.

====&quot;Forever Yesterday&quot;====
Their next adventure involves the transforming of the world into an alternate one at the whim of Meryet Karim, the second Sphinx as seen in the &quot;Forever Yesterday&quot; storyline. This alternate world involved Egypt becoming a super-power and the formation of the United States of Assyria where that reality&#x27;s Avengers served as Meryet&#x27;s government task force. This is undone by the New Warriors Nova, Marvel Man (Marvel Boy&#x27;s alternate counterpart), Firestar, and Dwayne Taylor (who is not Night Thrasher in this reality).

====Folding Circle====
The New Warriors, together with a few Psionex members, the Fantastic Four, and the Silver Surfer, fight a revitalized Terrax sometime after. Around this time, Silhouette joins, and the New Warriors meet Avenger Rage and solo hero Darkhawk. The Left Hand has also begun collecting random superpowered individuals for a team he names the Folding Circle, one member being Silhouette&#x27;s brother Midnight&#x27;s Fire.

The Warriors also fought the Fantastic Four when Marvel Boy, who was under the Puppet Master&#x27;s control, kidnapped the Puppet Master&#x27;s daughter Alicia Masters. The Puppet Master knew something was wrong with her. It was later revealed that a Skrull, Lyja had been impersonating Alicia.

Night Thrasher discovers his company, the Taylor Foundation, is involved in illegal dealings and sets out to find the truth. In the process, he discovers that his legal guardian, Andrew Chord, has been betraying him for an unidentified period of time. The team confronts the mutant immortal Gideon concerning his involvement and he handily defeats and tortures them before giving them the information they seek. Shortly thereafter, the team comes to a moral crossroads in a mission involving cocaine traffickers, and Thrasher leaves the team. Night Thrasher then comes into contact with the Folding Circle.

Returning home after the confrontation with Gideon, Marvel Boy accidentally kills his father when his father attacks him (as he has done in the past). Marvel Boy is arrested and found guilty of negligent homicide, while Firestar reveals her love for him.

With previously unrevealed abilities, Tai (Thrasher&#x27;s surrogate mother) confronts and seemingly kills Silhouette. Silhouette survives and assembles the remaining New Warriors. They learn from Chord of a mystical plot to take control of the world in Cambodia, and they recruit Rage and Darkhawk to help them. The Folding Circle also travels to Cambodia. The New Warriors (with later help of the Folding Circle) fight Tai, who reveals her plans for world domination. Tai is defeated and sacrificed in a mystical well along with the Left Hand. In the end, Thrasher rejoins the Warriors.

After the adventure, Rage is kicked out of the Avengers and Speedball invites him to join the New Warriors. Meanwhile, just having been convicted of his father&#x27;s murder, Marvel Boy is being escorted to the Vault via a Guardsman-guarded prison van. Namorita, Nova, and Firestar try to free him from the van, but he refuses, determined to serve his sentence. Firestar and Marvel Boy share one last moment and declare their love for one another.

====Namorita as leader====
Night Thrasher leaves the team to put the Taylor Foundation in order, and Namorita assumes leadership. The team meet Turbo (Michiko &quot;Mickey&quot; Musashi), and get involved in the civil war in the country Trans-Sabal. Although they eventually retreat, the actions of the Warriors (most notably Namorita) have not helped the country. Meanwhile, Silhouette has gone missing and Speedball&#x27;s parents split up. Speedball moves to New York with his mother to be closer to the New Warriors.

The team faces the new villain Darkling and meet Cloak and Dagger and a second Turbo (Michael Jeffries). Marvel Boy adapts to prison life and becomes good friends with the guards, most notably the man who would become Hybrid. Marvel Boy helps find a compromise between the inmates and the Vault staff, quelling an inmate uprising. Meanwhile, Carlton LaFroyge (Hindsight Lad), Speedball&#x27;s new neighbor, blackmails him into giving him Warriors membership after Carlton discovers Speedball&#x27;s secret identity.

Some time afterward, Namorita has a one-night stand with Kimeiko Ashu, a former adversary of Night Thrasher (unknown to her at that time). Ashu steals Namorita&#x27;s address book, discovers the secret identities of the Warriors and kidnaps their families. Rage&#x27;s grandmother, the last member of his family, accidentally dies. In retaliation, Rage kills Ashu. Night Thrasher justifies Rage&#x27;s actions in court and the judge rules in Rage&#x27;s favor and he is released into Chord&#x27;s custody. Namorita leaves the team, feeling guilty.

Nova is attacked by Garthan Saal, a Nova centurion, and after a conflict between the Warriors, Saal, Firelord, Air-Walker, and a power-mad Nova, Xandar is restored. Nova is promoted to the rank of Centurion Prime and allowed to return to Earth to continue his activities as a superhero.

Meanwhile, Namorita faces trouble in Atlantis, and is captured. Her body is undergoing a cellular change, as a result of her being a clone, into a blue-skinned Atlantean. After a conversation with Namor, she renames herself Kymaera and decides to rejoin the New Warriors. Later, Marvel Boy is released on parole, but after anti-mutant attacks on his mother, decides not to rejoin the New Warriors, instead joining Shinobi Shaw and the Upstarts (as planned by him and Thrasher) and renaming himself Justice.

====&quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;====

Soon after, the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; arc begins, with the Upstarts going on what is called the Younghunt, a mission to capture all of the surviving New Mutants (who are by then called X-Force) and Hellions. This competition brings the Upstarts into conflict with the Warriors (Firestar is a former Hellion) and X-Force. The Upstarts capture most of their targets, but Paige Guthrie convinces the Gamesmaster to play another game: instead of killing mutants, the Upstarts should try to find and train young mutants like her. The Gamesmaster is intrigued and cancels the competition.

====&quot;Time And Time Again&quot;====
Shortly thereafter, the original Sphinx returns, stealing a portion of the power held by Meryet Karim. New Warriors had earlier encountered her in &quot;New Warriors&quot; #10–13. Anath-Na Mut plans his revenge against the Warriors, transporting away its eight active members (Firestar, Justice, Kymaera, Night Thrasher, Nova, Rage, Silhouette and Speedball) to different places in the time-stream. In response, Hindsight Lad and Bandit gather a new team of Warriors (Dagger, Darkhawk, Powerpax and Turbo) to go and rescue the others with the aid of Meryet. They succeed and the two teams of Warriors combat the Sphinx together, who surrenders after learning of his own true nature and finally accepts Meryet&#x27;s ages-old offer of love. They merge into one composite being and depart into the time-stream to begin their life together anew. In &quot;New Warriors&quot; #51 the team is restructured as the Mad Thinker again advises the team, especially on the difficulties of growing up as individuals as a team. The main team is made up of the six original founders (Firestar, Justice, Kymaera, Night Thrasher, Nova, and Speedball). Rage. Hindsight Lad, Dagger and Alex Power become reserve members. Bandit and Silhouette leave the team.

Later, they face the Psionex team again and travel to the country of Zaire, where the team is captured by the Soldiers of Misfortune. At the end of the battle Kymeara is brainwashed and teleports away along with the villains. Night Thrasher and Rage leave the team after a falling out over their absence on the team&#x27;s previous mission, and the team also fights an enraged Namor, who eventually decides to help the team in their search for Kymeara.

The Warriors help out with a UN peace conference, assisted by Sabra. Nova loses his powers and Turbo and Alex Power become full members while Hindsight Lad becomes simply Hindsight. Night Thrasher and Rage decide to train Psionex. Next, the team involves themselves into &quot;Maximum Clonage&quot;, fighting and capturing Helix. The Scarlet Spider joins the team afterwards.

The team faces Psionex again, now led by former Warrior Night Thrasher, and also deal with a young girl, Rina Patel, who has seen a vision of the future in which Speedball dies. Speedball has had trouble controlling his powers. They are almost able to retrieve Kymaera from the Soldiers of Misfortune, but fail. The team next deal with an impostor Scarlet Spider after the real Scarlet Spider replaces Spider-Man.

====&quot;Future Shock&quot;====
Eventually, the team comes into contact with the Guardians of the Galaxy, who are searching for Speedball, calling him a time anomaly, before they disappear again. The original Sphinx returns, citing the same reasons, and kills Speedball. Another player, Advent, comes into play, killing all of the Warriors but Timeslip. Advent is a time-traveler, trying to alter time so that the future will be molded to his own wish. His son, Darrion Grobe seeks to stop him, and creates a duplicate of Speedball&#x27;s body from when he was trapped in the kinetic dimension during &quot;Time And Time Again&quot;, so that he can travel to the first alteration point, leaving the actual Speedball in the kinetic dimension, meaning that Darrion Grobe replaced Speedball from &quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 1) #50 and onwards. Instead of dying, the New Warriors are transported to the year 2092, where they have seven minutes to save themselves before reality is unmade and stop Advent. Meanwhile, the Sphinx takes care of Advent in 1996, thereby stopping Advent in 2092 as well. The New Warriors are led into the kinetic dimension by a hologram of Darrion Grobe, and with the help of Timeslip and the real Speedball, are able to return to their proper time.

====Volume&#x27;s end====

Later, a rogue faction of HYDRA reveals that it has been living in the team&#x27;s basement even before the team moved in, but they are stopped by the combined actions of the Warriors and the Avengers. Helix and Turbo (Michiko) both decide to leave, but Turbo is confronted by a man called Dan Jones, who has come to reclaim the Torpedo suit the Turbos wear. Dan Jones is in fact the last Dire Wraith Volx, an enemy the Warriors fought against before and who killed the other Turbo (Mike). Volx claims the suit and kidnaps Friday (the Kymellian spaceship which is not only an ally of Power Pack, but also of the Warriors).

With the help of the Thinker, Night Thrasher and Rage rescue Namorita from the Soldiers of Misfortune, while the Warriors join forces with Garthan Saal to stop Volx, almost leading to the death of Friday. During the adventure, Firestar asks Justice to marry her, to which he happily agrees. Night Thrasher, Rage, and Namorita join their former teammates, thanks to the Thinker. Garthan Saal sacrifices himself against Volx, transferring his powers to Nova. Eventually, the reunited New Warriors defeat Volx, at the cost of Timeslip&#x27;s powers. Timeslip sabotages the power neutralizer Volx meant to use to rid every superhuman on Earth of their powers. Turbo decides to use the suit to continue on in Mike&#x27;s honor, and offers Hindsight the chance to share it with her as Mike did. Alex Power decides to leave the team, believing that Power Pack could&#x27;ve defeated Volx without nearly destroying Friday. Night Thrasher, Namorita, and Rage rejoin the Warriors as old grudges are mended and the team comes full circle. During a mission involving a Badoon invasion sometime later, Ultra Girl and Slapstick help out the Warriors and are made members.

==&quot;The New Warriors&quot; (vol. 2)==
===Fictional team history===
Speedball tries to assemble a new team after they disbanded (between the first and second volume), but initially fails. Namorita and Nova arrive to cheer him up when they are called in to fight Blastaar, and they are quickly aided by Bolt, Firestar, Justice, Turbo, and new hero Aegis. Although Justice and Firestar decline to rejoin the team, the other heroes agree to reform the New Warriors. Shortly thereafter, they fight the Eugenix group, who try to kill Namorita for being a clone.

They next involve themselves in a gang war, at the behest of Aegis. This leads to their headquarters being destroyed and the team being ambushed by Heavy Mettle. This group of villains had been hired by Joe Silvermane, the former Blackwing. They move into a new headquarters, a firehouse supplied by a firefighter named Dalton Beck (who is actually the villain Firestrike) as a ploy by Silvermane so that he can attain Turbo&#x27;s suit. They also team up with Generation X to stop the new villain Biohazard. After an adventure in the subway, Turbo decides to trust Dalton with her secret identity, and Firestrike hesitates, but eventually decides to not kill Turbo. She uncovers his identity as Firestrike accidentally, but he surrenders and assists the Warriors in apprehending Silvermane. However, the two lovers are forced to split up as Beck enters the Federal Witness Protection Program.

In Seattle, Night Thrasher and Iron Fist fight The Hand, which is able to kidnap Iron Fist. Night Thrasher calls in the Warriors to help him. They are able to find Iron Fist and their opponent Junzo Muto, but the ritual of stealing Iron Fist&#x27;s powers has already been completed. Junzo initially defeats them thanks to their lack of teamwork, but finds his match in Night Thrasher. Fatigue strikes however, and the Warriors are forced to retreat. They next face the rogue sentient Iron Man armor and are promptly defeated, before it sacrifices its existence to save Tony Stark from dying.

In the last issue of the series (&quot;New Warriors&quot; vol. 2, #10) the team (minus Nova and Speedball) travels to Olympus, brought there by Hercules, and meets Zeus. Aegis is accused of stealing his magical breastplate by Hercules, but it was in fact a gift from Athena. During the following battle with Hercules, Aegis proves his worth and he is accepted by both Hercules and Zeus. Bolt also decides to reveal that he is sick with the Legacy Virus to the team. In the last pages, Night Thrasher, seeing the good the Warriors having been doing lately, decides to return to the team. He is happily accepted.

==&quot;The New Warriors&quot; (vol. 3)==
===Fictional team history===

====&quot;Civil War&quot;====

The New Warriors, including Microbe, Namorita, Night Thrasher and Speedball (Nova had gone into space to play a part in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Annihilation&quot; storyline), take part in a televised fight with a group of supervillains. During the fight, one of the supervillains, Nitro, explodes, killing 612 people, including most of the New Warriors. This serves as the start of the &quot;Civil War&quot; story arc.

Throughout the story arc, five former New Warriors (Dagger, Debrii, Justice, Silhouette, and Ultra Girl) join Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers, an underground coalition of anti-registration superheroes.

A listing of the Warriors on DestroyAllWarriors.com, a fictional anti-Warriors website created by Hindsight, indicates that all of the Warriors involved in the Stamford incident have been killed. Cameraman John Fernandez is listed as well. The explosion throws Speedball hundreds of miles into Upstate New York. Although he survived the blast, he was depowered due to a kinetic overload. Two unfortunate men who found his body after the blast are accidentally killed when his body releases its stored kinetic energy.

Speedball seems to be depowered, and is imprisoned, facing criminal charges for the Stamford disaster. However, he regains his powers, which are now activated whenever he experiences pain. Feeling guilty for his role in the deaths of so many people, Speedball takes on the new identity of Penance and joins the government-funded Thunderbolts. Firestar decides to retire from the superhero business altogether, although she later appears as a member of Young Allies Former New Warrior Aegis appears in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #9, escaping from S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s Superhuman Restraint Unit with the help of Jamie Madrox. He later dies after jumping out a window expecting his armor to protect him. Justice, Silhouette, Debrii, Rage, Timeslip, Zero-G and Aegis all appear on the cover of &quot;&quot; #1 as a part of the 142 registered superheroes. Justice has a prominent role in this series as trainer to the recruits. Turbo is a member of the Loners and a student at the Avengers Academy. Darkhawk has his amulet ripped off at Murderworld and Bolt dies at the hands of his former mentor Agent Zero.

==&quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 4)==
===Publication history===
In vol. 4, #2 of New Warriors, Night Thrasher tries to talk the depowered Sofia Mantega into joining the team. She refuses him and the rest of the team is seen in the shadows watching the exchange. In the next issue the team is revealed, though not all of their identities. The team is shown to be:

*Blackwing (Barnell Bohusk) – Bohusk is the depowered mutant known as Beak. Blackwing wears a suit based on the Vulture&#x27;s that gives him flight, super strength and the ability to fire energy blasts.
*Decibel (Jonothon &quot;Jono&quot; Evan Starsmore) – Starsmore is the depowered mutant known as Chamber. Decibel uses the Klaw&#x27;s device which gives him sonic abilities including flight, the ability to create sound constructs and the ability to fire energy blasts.
*Longstrike (Christine Cord) – Cord is the depowered mutant known as Tattoo and the sister of Phaser. Longstrike wears a version of Stilt-Man&#x27;s armor that allows her to extend her limbs and grants her super strength.
*Night Thrasher (Donyell Taylor) – Taylor is the only member of the team to be a former New Warrior. He appeared in vol. 2 as Bandit. Night Thrasher is a skilled martial artist as well as bio electric mutant.
*Phaser (Christian Cord) – Cord is the depowered mutant known as Radian and the brother of Longstrike. Phaser wears armor based on the Beetle&#x27;s that allows him flight and the ability to fire energy blasts. 
*Ripcord (Miranda Leevald) – Leevald is the depowered mutant known as Stacy X. She is also equipped with web shooters, frog springs, and a Slyde suit. 
*Skybolt (Vincent Stewart) – Stewart is the depowered mutant known as Redneck. Skybolt wears a version of Turbo&#x27;s armor that gives him flight and houses various weapons. 
*Tempest (Angel Salvadore) – Salvadore is the depowered mutant known as Angel. Tempest uses technology that gives her flight as well as fire and ice powers. 
*Wondra (Jubilation Lee) – Lee is the depowered mutant known as Jubilee. Wondra wears the Wizard&#x27;s technology allowing her to manipulate gravity that grants her flight, super strength and a personal force field

Grace and Kaz are also introduced in the third issue. Grace is a teenager who has a natural talent with technology. Kaz builds the weapons that Night Thrasher designs. On their first mission the team goes up against a new Zodiac. Longstrike is killed when she tries to take on this incarnation&#x27;s version of Cancer. In issue #6, the team reveals each of their identities to the rest of the team. This is the first time Ripcord is clearly identified as Stacy X. Night Thrasher does not reveal his identity to the team, but it is revealed to the readers at the end of the issue.

Night Thrasher announces that he is breaking up the team. Sofia comes to their headquarters and joins the team after making an impassioned speech about why they should stay together. She becomes Renascence. Renascence uses six metallic tentacles that can fire energy blasts. She also uses technology that creates a force field around her. Several new characters are introduced during the series&#x27; run. They include a team of supervillains named Alphaclan. In issue #10, a third teenager named Aja is introduced as part of the support staff. He is another technological expert, specializing in computers.

Later in the series the team is apprehending another new supervillain team, the Dread Dealers, when they are attacked by the New Warriors Task Force, led in part by Detective Bev Sykes. During the battle, Ripcord and Skybolt are apparently killed (Stacy X shows up later with her powers in &quot;Vengeance&quot; #1). The team finds out that Night Thrasher has been manipulating them all while finding artifacts necessary to make a time machine. His plan is to go back in time to stop the Stamford accident and keep his brother from dying. Instead, the team ends up in a future in which the country is run by Iron Man (who in this reality is a resurrected Dwayne Taylor) and Night Thrasher is Tony Stark. Taylor kills the defenseless Stark simply because he is an &quot;enemy of the state&quot;. Donyell ends up having to kill the brother he traveled through time to save. Once the team is back in their own time, they agree to disband.

===Counter Force Team===
In the pages of &quot;&quot; #6 (January 2008), the team&#x27;s drill instructor Gauntlet is left battered with &#x27;NW&#x27; (the New Warriors tag) sprayed on him. It is revealed that former New Warrior Slapstick attacked Gauntlet out of revenge for the man&#x27;s comments about his dead friends while drilling the Initiative recruits. Unfortunately, Rage is suspected of the crime. In &quot;Avengers: The Initiative&quot; #10 (May 2008) Justice forms a team including former New Warriors Debrii, Rage, Slapstick and Ultra Girl.

In &quot;Avengers: The Initiative&quot; #12, Justice&#x27;s team of New Warriors joins forces with the MVP clone and the surviving Scarlet Spiders as a &quot;Counter Force&quot; of underground registered heroes intent on monitoring the actions of the Fifty State Initiative. Ultra Girl decides to leave Counter Force to stay with the Initiative, telling Vance that she still believes in the Initiative.

The team later partners with Night Thrasher&#x27;s new team of Warriors to uncover the truth about the Stamford Incident and the original Night Thrasher&#x27;s death.

Following the disbandment of the last team of Warriors, Counter Force has reclaimed the &quot;New Warriors&quot; name and they have added the new Night Thrasher to their ranks. With Norman Osborn taking control of the Initiative, the New Warriors return to Camp Hammond to reveal the truth of MVP&#x27;s death, but they find themselves forced to defend the Initiative from the reactivated Thor clone (now called Ragnarok). During the battle, the Warriors suffer another casualty when Ragnarok kills one of the Scarlet Spiders.

The new New Warriors now call themselves the Avengers Resistance and are fugitives, being accused of releasing the clone of Thor. They work alongside Gauntlet and Tigra. The Avengers Resistance later help the Initiative team called Heavy Hitters to secede from the program. Later, Night Thrasher is captured and Debrii resigns from the group.

After the events of &quot;Siege&quot;, the Avengers Resistance becomes obsolete. Justice and Tigra become staff members of Avengers Academy, while Gauntlet returns to the Army.

==&quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 5)==

===Publication history===
In this new team, Justice and Speedball are returning Warriors, while Nova (Sam Alexander), Scarlet Spider (Kaine), Hummingbird (Aracely Penalba), Sun Girl (Selah Burke), an Inhuman named Haechi (Mark Sim), and an Atlantean Water Snake (Faira Sar Namora) are among the new members. Later issues added two New Men (Jake Waffles and Mr. Whiskers) as supporting cast and Silhouette as a member.

===Fictional team history===
Having taken the road again after renouncing their teacher jobs at Avengers Academy, Speedball and Justice find themselves in the town of New Salem, Colorado, where they get into a little fight with the Salem&#x27;s Seven, but quickly patch things up after it is clear it was nothing more than a misunderstanding; their leader, Vertigo, explains later to Justice that the place is a haven for all people &quot;born of magic&quot; with Salem&#x27;s Seven acting as the town&#x27;s resident protectors. While the conversation deviates to Justice&#x27;s and Speedball&#x27;s intention of reforming the New Warriors and the difficulties that that will probably bring due the team&#x27;s persisting bad reputation for their involvement in the Civil War events, they notice the teleportation arrival into the town of a trio of enigmatic figures clad in advanced armor. One of these beings declares that &quot;the blood here is tainted&quot; and all must be burned down.

In the ensuing fight, these three strange individuals tell Justice of how they once tried to help mutantkind but were instead betrayed by the X-Men. Eventually, Speedball and the rest of the Salem&#x27;s Seven are drawn into the combat, but that is still not enough to halt the mysterious assailants who declare that Robbie is also &quot;corrupted&quot; – &quot;altered by an other-dimensional energy&quot;. The strangers knock out Brutacus, one of the town protectors, to later take a gene sample of him &quot;as requested by their lord&quot;. Taking advantage of their enemies&#x27; distraction, Justice manages to land a telekinetic blow on the face of the trio&#x27;s leader and crack his armor, revealing him to be a hairy humanoid. As Vance tries to parley with them, the enigmatic attackers simply continue their proclamations against the town&#x27;s inhabitants and mutants, arguing there is no point trying to talk as &quot;judgement is coming&quot;, to later teleport out of town.

Armed with the scant facts they learned of their aggressors, Justice uses his telekinetic powers to propel himself and Speedball to Avengers Tower at a vertiginous velocity. They are met by an empty place with the exception of Edwin Jarvis, the tower&#x27;s resident butler, who informs them that the Avengers are busy elsewhere and conducts them to the Avengers&#x27;s database. There they discover a video file made by Cyclops that reveals the identity of the town attackers: the Evolutionaries, a group of pre-homo sapiens that had been transformed in the ancient past by Phastos of the Eternals, who gave them advanced intelligence, armor and power, and assigned them the mission to protect the most advanced human subspecies from the others; at that time, homo sapiens. But left to their own devices, the Evolutionaries had decided that the most advanced subspecies in the present were the mutants and that the best way to protect them was to annihilate the rest of humanity, a situation that the X-Men stopped.

While pondering why the Evolutionaries had changed objectives once again, Justice and Speedball hear an alarm and the computer informs them of an emergency taking place on New York&#x27;s subway system. With none else to attend to it, Justice asks Robbie if he can act as an Avenger for a day, to which Speedball responds that he won&#x27;t: he will act as a [New] Warrior. They head out and arrive just in time to rescue Mark Sim and Sun Girl, two inexperienced heroes who had tried to stop a second group of Evolutionaries from killing the mutant Morlocks that live in New York&#x27;s sewer near the subway. As the enemy flees with the arrival of Speedball and Justice, a new problem arises when police arrives to the scene and the officers start to panic at Mark Sim because his appearance coincides with ill-reported accounts of witnesses (and due the general public distress at the new Inhumans popping up from the general population in the aftermath of Thanos&#x27;s recent invasion of Earth). As a shooting starts, the four heroes escape from there through the air with Justice shielding them from the bullets.

As the four recover on the roof of a nearby building, Mark succumbs to his emotions, the incident with the police being the last&#x27;s straw on a series of awful days since he gained his powers (and the horn on his head). The other three try to reassure him and calm his uncertainty at what the future holds for him. But an argument is bred between Justice and Sun Girl on differing opinions about it, which Robbie tries to broker or stop. To prove her point and to demonstrate Mark&#x27;s energy absorption abilities, Sun Girl shoots the distressed young man, to the shock of Justice and Speedball. After the situation defuses, they discuss what to do with the Evolutionaries: Justice wants to leave this matter on the hands of the Avengers when they return, but Sun Girl convinces them to take care of it themselves. However, Justice wants to first find Nova, their New Warriors reservist member.

Meanwhile, in the sunny beaches of Mazatlan, Mexico, Aracely and Kaine make a stop to look for food supplies after she depleted them with her constant snacking.

Seeing that Nova doesn&#x27;t answer his phone, they head back to the Salem&#x27;s Seven and through their help and that of New Salem&#x27;s magical inhabitants, they locate the boy. As it turns out, he along with Hummingbird, Scarlet Spider and Faira Sar Namora of Atlantis, were kidnapped separately by the Evolutionaries and the High Evolutionary, and were held as prisoners in Mount Wundagore. Rushing, they arrive as the Evolutionaries are about to execute Nova, following his and the other prisoners&#x27; attempt to break out. Justice tries to reason with the High Evolutionary, but as this one gives a cryptic refusal and Nova reveals his plan of eliminating &quot;mostly everyone&quot;, they opt to skip the diplomacy. A chaotic fight ensues, with the prisoners, Sun Girl, Mark and the New Warriors forming an impromptu team that manages to defeat the small army of Evolutionaries through their diverse and very different powers and abilities.

However, with his allies defeated, the High Evolutionary accelerates his plan and decides to activate the machine he was working on. Nova tries to stop him, but he is knocked unconscious by an energy blast. The others pursue the High Evolutionary and try to reanimate Nova, who manages to mumble to the team the machine&#x27;s purpose – killing &quot;people with powers&quot;. The machine begins its process, bathing the entire mountain in a pinkish light: everyone on the team is then brought down to the ground as an excruciating sensation of pain torments their bodies and minds. Everyone but Sun Girl, who is a normal non-altered human without special genes, alien ancestry or magic.

Noticing this, the High Evolutionary approaches her politely and explains that he didn&#x27;t intended for the situation to occur in that manner; before the outbreak and the fight, he was trying to use Nova&#x27;s helmet to allow his machine to work more efficiently and quickly, saving its victims of any lengthy pain as they die. Also, that he took no pleasure on any of these events and, as he had stated before, he would have wanted to act differently but had no time to do so; he had been informed that the Celestials – a group of insanely powerful, impossibly technologically advanced, almost unstoppable aliens who had manipulated life across the universe since billions of years ago for their own mysterious purposes – would come to &quot;judge&quot; Earth very soon. Should the Celestials find the inhabitants of a planet wanting, they would annihilate them and, allegedly, this time they expected Earth to contain only one dominant species: humanity, with no offshoots or deviations of any kind. Thus the reason the High Evolutionary created the machine to kill any mutant, inhuman, hybrid or person of any kind that could displease the Celestials.

== &quot;New Warriors&quot; (canceled vol. 6) ==
In March 2020, a new team was announced with the original New Warriors serving as mentors. The series would have been written by Daniel Kibblesmith with art by Luciano Vecchio. This New Warriors team included Screentime, a &quot;Meme-Obsessed&quot; teenager connected to the internet; Snowflake, a non-binary teenager with ice powers; Safespace, Snowflake&#x27;s twin brother who can create forcefields; B-Negative, a living vampire who received a blood transfusion from Morbius; and Trailblazer, who has a pocket dimension inside of her backpack. The first issue was originally solicited for publication on April 15, 2020.

The new team was criticized for mocking progressive values by naming diverse superheroes after the slang terms &quot;snowflake&quot; and &quot;safe space&quot;. The series was canceled by Marvel without comment. The cancelation has been attributed to fan backlash and the COVID-19 pandemic. B-Negative would make his official debut in &quot;Darkhold: Blade&quot; due to Kibblesmith and Vecchio working on that comic.

==Career==
Hughes trained in dance and performing arts at the Arts Educational Schools London. In 1981, she originated the role of Victoria the White Cat in the London production of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Cats&quot;. In 1983, Hughes starred with John Travolta in the musical film &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. She played the role of Laura, an English dancer who is the romantic interest of Travolta&#x27;s character Tony Manero. Hughes also appeared on the sitcom &quot;Blossom&quot;, and as the X-Men character Emma Frost in the television movie &quot;Generation X&quot; (1996).

In 1997, Hughes starred in Aaron Spelling&#x27;s short-lived primetime soap opera &quot;Pacific Palisades&quot;. She was a frequent guest star on the television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, playing the mother of the Halliwell girls, Patricia &quot;Patty&quot; Halliwell. She provided the voice of Lara, Kal-El&#x27;s biological mother in &quot;&quot;. Another voice-over role she had was Miss Robertson on an episode of Fox&#x27;s animated comedy series &quot;Life with Louie&quot;.
From 1985 to 1992, she played Anna Devane on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Hughes won a Daytime Emmy in 1991, for Outstanding Lead Actress on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She was nominated for the same category in 1990 for Anna, in 2000 for &quot;All My Children&quot; as Alex, and, in 2002, as Anna. After establishing herself as a daytime television star, Hughes shot a feature film cameo as a soap opera actress who loses an award to Sally Field in the satirical film &quot;Soapdish&quot; (1991). Two years later, she played a leading role in the film &quot;Aspen Extreme&quot; (1993). It was announced in April 2006 that Hughes would be returning to &quot;GH&quot;. In May 2006, as part of the May Sweeps period, three &quot;GH&quot; veterans would return. Finola Hughes would be reunited with Tristan Rogers (Robert Scorpio) and Emma Samms (Holly Sutton). Following a rise in ratings from her sweeps return, Hughes returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; for a limited run through August 2006. She returned the following year on 13 July 2007 and once again on 15 April 2008.

In September 2008, Hughes guest-starred in the &quot;General Hospital&quot; spinoff series &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot;. It has been said that Hughes would return to &quot;GH&quot; in early 2012 as character Anna Devane to be with her daughter, Robin Scorpio, and help her through her toughest year.

<text>The Honda Point disaster was the largest peacetime loss of U.S. Navy ships in U.S. history. On the evening of September 8, 1923, seven destroyers, while traveling at 20 knots (37 km/h), ran aground at Honda Point (also known as Point Pedernales; the cliffs just off-shore called Devil&#x27;s Jaw), a few miles from the northern side of the Santa Barbara Channel off Point Arguello on the Gaviota Coast in Santa Barbara County, California. Two other ships grounded, but were able to maneuver free off the rocks. Twenty-three sailors died in the disaster. Navigational errors, compounded by unusual ocean currents from the recent Great Kanto earthquake were the likeliest cause.

==Geography==
The area of Honda Point is extremely treacherous for central California mariners, as it features a series of rocky outcroppings, collectively known as Woodbury Rocks (one of which is today named Destroyer Rock on navigational charts). Called the Devil&#x27;s Jaw, the area has been a navigational hazard since the Spanish explorers first came in the 16th century. It is just north of the entrance to the Santa Barbara Channel, which was the intended route of the destroyers involved in the disaster.

===Honda Point today===

Honda Point, also called Point Pedernales, is located on the seacoast at Vandenberg Space Force Base, near the city of Lompoc, California. There is a plaque and a memorial to the disaster at the site. The memorial includes a ship&#x27;s bell from &quot;Chauncey&quot;. A propeller and a propeller shaft from &quot;Delphy&quot; is on display outside the Veterans&#x27; Memorial Building, in Lompoc, California.

==Incident==
The fourteen ships of Destroyer Squadron Eleven (DesRon 11) were steaming south in column from San Francisco Bay to San Diego Bay on September 8, 1923. All were s, less than five years old.

Captain Edward H. Watson, an 1895 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, commanded the squadron. Assigned as commodore of DesRon 11 in July 1922, it was his first time as a unit commander. Watson flew his flag on .

The ships turned east to course 095, supposedly heading into the Santa Barbara Channel, at 21:00. The ships were navigating by dead reckoning, estimating positions from their course and speed, as measured by propeller revolutions per minute. At that time radio navigation aids were new and not completely trusted.

USS &quot;Delphy&quot; was equipped with a radio navigation receiver, but her captain, Lieutenant Commander Donald T. Hunter, who was also acting as the squadron&#x27;s navigator, ignored its indicated bearings, believing them to be erroneous. No effort was made to take soundings of water depths using a fathometer as this would require the ships to slow down to take the measurements.

The ships were performing an exercise that simulated wartime conditions, and Captain Watson also wanted the squadron to make a fast passage to San Diego, so the decision was made not to slow down. Despite the heavy fog, Commodore Watson ordered all ships to travel in close formation and, turning too soon, went aground. Six others followed and sank. Two ships whose captains disobeyed the close-formation order survived, although they also hit the rocks.

Earlier the same day, the mail steamship ran aground nearby.

==Ships involved==




The lost ships were:
* , the flagship in the column. She ran aground on the shore at . After running aground, she sounded her siren. The siren alerted some of the later ships in the column, helping them avoid the tragedy. Three of her crew died. Eugene Dooman, a State Department expert on Japan, who survived, was aboard as a guest of Captain Watson, whom he had met in Japan.
* , the flagship of Destroyer Division 33 under Captain Robert Morris, USNA Class of 1900. She was following a few hundred yards behind the &quot;Delphy&quot;. She saw the &quot;Delphy&quot; suddenly stop, and turned to port (left) in response. As a result, she ran aground on the coast.
* made no move to turn. She tore her hull open on submerged rocks, and the inrush of water capsized her onto her starboard side. Twenty men died.
* turned to starboard, but struck an offshore rock.
* turned to port and also hit a rock.
* stuck next to &quot;Woodbury&quot;.
* ran aground while attempting to rescue sailors from the capsized &quot;Young&quot;.

Light damage was recorded by:
* , the flagship of Destroyer Division 31 under Commander William S. Pye, USNA Class of 1901. Sixth in line between &quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Fuller&quot;, she ran aground, but was able to extricate herself and was not lost.
* (DD-301) was lightly damaged.

The remaining five ships avoided the rocks:
* , the flagship of Destroyer Division 32 under Commander Walter G. Roper, USNA Class of 1898.
* 

==Rescue efforts==
Rescue attempts promptly followed the accident. Local ranchers, who were alerted by the commotion of the disaster, rigged up breeches buoys from the surrounding clifftops and lowered them down to the ships that had run aground. Fishermen nearby who had seen the tragedy picked up members of the crew from USS &quot;Fuller&quot; and USS &quot;Woodbury&quot;.

The surviving members of the crew of the capsized &quot;Young&quot; were able to climb to safety on the nearby USS &quot;Chauncey&quot; via a lifeline. The five destroyers in Destroyer Squadron Eleven which avoided running aground at Honda Point were also able to contribute to rescue efforts by picking up sailors who had been thrown into the water and by assisting those who were stuck aboard the wreckage of other ships.

After the disaster, the government did not attempt to salvage any of the wrecks at Honda Point due to the nature of the damage each ship sustained. The wrecks themselves, along with the equipment that remained on them, were sold to a scrap merchant for a total of $1,035. The wrecked ships were still not moved by late , since they may be clearly seen in film footage taken from the German airship as she headed towards Los Angeles on her circumnavigation of the globe; the film footage is used in the documentary film &quot;Farewell&quot; (2009).

==Court martial==

The seven-officer Navy court-martial board, presided over by Vice Admiral Henry A. Wiley, commander battleship divisions of the Battle Fleet, ruled that the disaster was the fault of the fleet commander and the flagship&#x27;s navigators. They assigned blame to the captain of each ship that ran aground, following the tradition that a captain&#x27;s first responsibility is to his own ship, even when in formation. Eleven officers involved were brought before general courts-martial on the charges of negligence and culpable inefficiency to perform one&#x27;s duty. This was the largest single group of officers ever court-martialed in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s history.

The court martial ruled that the events of the Honda Point Disaster were &quot;directly attributable to bad errors and faulty navigation&quot; by Captain Watson. Watson was stripped of his seniority, and three other officers were admonished.

Those officers who were court-martialed were all acquitted.

Captain Watson, who had been defended by Admiral Thomas Tingey Craven, was commended by his peers and the government for assuming full responsibility for the disaster at Honda Point. He could have tried to blame a variety of factors for the disaster, but instead, he set an example for those others by accepting the responsibility entirely on his shoulders.

A Court of Inquiry led by Rear Admiral William V. Pratt and aided by Captains George C. Day and David F. Sellers recommended Cmdr. Roper for a Letter of Commendation for turning his division away from danger.

===Navigational errors===
The fourteen &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers of Destroyer Squadron Eleven were to follow the flagship USS &quot;Delphy&quot; in column formation from San Francisco Bay, through the Santa Barbara Channel, and finally to San Diego. Destroyer Squadron Eleven was on a twenty-four-hour exercise from northern California to southern California. The flagship was responsible for navigation. As the &quot;Delphy&quot; steamed along the coastline, poor visibility meant the navigators had to go by the age-old technique of dead reckoning. They had to estimate their position based on their speed and heading. LCdr Donald Hunter, the commander of the &quot;Delphy&quot;, was also acting as the squadron&#x27;s navigator, overriding his ship&#x27;s navigator, Lieutenant (junior grade) Lawrence Blodgett. The &quot;Delphy&quot; did have radio direction finding (RDF) equipment, which picked up signals from a station at Point Arguello, but RDF was new and the bearings obtained were dismissed by Hunter as unreliable. Based solely on dead reckoning, Captain Watson ordered the fleet to turn east into the Santa Barbara Channel. However, the &quot;Delphy&quot; was actually several miles northeast of where they thought they were, and the error caused the ships to run aground on Honda Point.

The &quot;Kennedy&quot; intercepted radio bearings to the &quot;Delphy&quot; and to the &quot;Stoddert&quot;, and accurately determined the fleet&#x27;s position. When the &quot;Kennedy&quot; reached the turning point, Commander Walter G. Roper, in charge of Division 32 (&quot;Kennedy&quot;, &quot;Paul Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Stoddert&quot;, and &quot;Thompson&quot;) at the rear of the column, ordered his ships to slow down and then to stop, and avoided running aground.

===Ocean conditions===
At his court martial, LCdr Hunter, the commander of the &quot;Delphy&quot; and the navigator for the squadron, testified. &quot;I think there is also a possibility that abnormal currents caused by the Japanese earthquake might have been another contributory cause, or magnetic disturbances connected with the solar eclipse affected the compassbut of these I cannot, of course, speak with any first hand knowledge.&quot; On September 1, 1923, eight days before the disaster, the Great Kantō earthquake had occurred in Japan. Unusually large swells and strong currents arose off the coast of California and remained for a number of days. Before Destroyer Squadron Eleven even reached Honda Point, a number of ships had encountered navigational problems as a result of unusual currents.

As DesRon 11 began their exercise run down the California coast, they made their way through these swells and currents. While the squadron was traveling through these swells and currents, their estimations of speed and bearing used for dead reckoning were being affected. The navigators aboard the lead ship &quot;Delphy&quot; did not take into account the effects of the strong currents and large swells in their estimations. Consequently, the entire squadron was off course and positioned near the treacherous coastline of Honda Point instead of the open ocean of the Santa Barbara Channel. Coupled with darkness and thick fog, the swells and currents attributed to the earthquake in Japan made accurate navigation by dead reckoning nearly impossible for the &quot;Delphy&quot;. The geography of Honda Point, which is completely exposed to wind and waves, created a deadly environment once the unusually strong swells and currents were added to the coastline.

Once the error in navigation occurred, the weather conditions and ocean conditions sealed the fate of the squadron. The weather surrounding Honda Point at the time of the disaster was windy and foggy while the geography of the area created strong counter-currents and swells that forced the ships into the rocks once they entered the area.

<text>Shawn Murphy, (born July 27, 1951) is a Canadian politician.

Born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Murphy attended the University of Prince Edward Island, and later the University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law, graduating with a law degree in 1976. He returned to Prince Edward Island and joined a local law practice, working alongside future Premier Joe Ghiz. In 1997, he was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. Murphy is married and has three adult children: Kevin, Paul, and Brian.

Murphy was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of Charlottetown since the election of 2000. During the Martin government, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans with special emphasis on the Oceans Action Plan.

He was re-elected with nearly 50% of the vote in the 2004 federal election.
Despite rumours of his vulnerability in the 2006 federal election, Murphy was reelected with slightly more than 50% of the vote. With the Liberals now in opposition, Murphy became the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Murphy was re-elected in the 2008 federal election, again winning by a comfortable margin. He announced on October 13, 2010 that he would not be running in the next election.

<text>Exidy, Inc. was an American developer and manufacturer of coin-operated electro-mechanical and video games which operated from 1973 to 1999. They manufactured many notable titles including &quot;Death Race&quot; (1976), &quot;Circus&quot; (1978), &quot;Star Fire&quot; (1978), &quot;Venture&quot; (1981), &quot;Mouse Trap&quot; (1981), &quot;Crossbow&quot; (1983), and &quot;Chiller&quot; (1986). They were also the creators of the Exidy Sorcerer (1978) home computer platform.

==History==
Harold Ray “Pete” Kauffman had worked in the technological field at Data Disc Corporation with Charles McEwan and John Metzler. When the two broke off to form the graphics terminal company Ramtek Corporation in Sunnyvale, California, Kauffman joined them as a marketing executive. In late 1972, Kauffman was one of a handful of engineers sent to examine the prototype of Atari Inc’s &quot;Pong&quot; (1972) in the Andy Capp’s Tavern in Sunnyvale. Kauffman recalled of the experience:

&quot;I was really excited when I first saw the &quot;Pong&quot; game on test at a local pub. It was assembled in an old oak barrel ‘table model’ without a coin door. The quarters just dropped into the barrel…After playing the game, I tried to move it slightly. It wouldn’t move. It must have been full of quarters. This could not have been a fad!&quot;

Ramtek subsequently got into manufacturing coin-operated video games as a side business. Kauffman, however, believed that he could do more with a company dedicated to exploiting the new trend in electronic games. He and Ampex engineer Samuel Hawes formed a new company to enter the coin-op industry, Exidy, Inc on October 30, 1973. The name was a portmanteau of the phrase, “Excellence in Dynamics.”

Exidy’s first products were in the ball-and-paddle genre, including a basic clone of Atari’s &quot;Pong&quot; and &quot;TV Pinball&quot; (1974), which may have been modeled on an unreleased Ramtek game called &quot;Knockout&quot;. In 1975, Exidy began manufacturing electro-mechanical games with a game called &quot;Old Time Basketball&quot; (1975).

To help get their games a wider market, Exidy opened a licensing arrangement with the large amusement manufacturer Chicago Coin to license their video games. In 1975, John Metzler joined Exidy from Ramtek and produced a game called &quot;Destruction Derby&quot; (1975). Under the licensing arrangement, Chicago Coin produced a version called &quot;Demolition Derby&quot; (1975) which became a success, but they refused to pay their licensing fees to Exidy due to Chicago Coin’s failing financial state. Needing to make a distinct game to compete with &quot;Demolition Derby&quot;, another engineer who had joined from Ramtek named Howell Ivy was assigned to create a quick turnaround. The resulting game, &quot;Death Race&quot; (1976), was a minor success before it attracted notice for its violent content. The resulting controversy gave Exidy a national profile with stories appearing on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; as well as increased sales of the game. Several follow-up games from the company used the Death Race hardware, including &quot;Super Death Chase&quot; (1977) and &quot;Score&quot; (1977).

The salesman and spokesman for the company during the &quot;Death Race&quot; controversy, Paul Jacobs, served as the company’s chief sales person from 1976-1978 and 1983-1984. Originally from Chicago Coin, Jacobs helped to build the company to become the third biggest manufacturer of arcade video games in 1977 and stabilized the company during a period of uncertainty after a downturn in video arcade games.

Howell Ivy began working with microprocessor technology after &quot;Death Race&quot;. He created the early color graphics game &quot;Car Polo&quot; (1977) and a game with a similar conceit to &quot;Breakout&quot; (1976) called &quot;Circus&quot; (1978). &quot;Circus&quot; inspired a number of clones in both Japan and North America, becoming Exidy’s best-selling game at the time with 7,000 units sold.

Their exploration into microprocessors also led to the development of the Sorcerer personal computer. Partnering with early commercial computer retailer Paul Terrell, Exidy developed the hardware of a S-100 bus compatible system first sold in 1978. The hardware had no native graphics modes, though had a text mode with programmable characters. Exidy supported the system with documentation, tools, and a few in-house developed games, but the system did not have much of a following in North America. It later found support in Australia and Europe, particularly in the Netherlands where it was offered with a course on the educational channel TELEAC, in place of the Belgian DAI computer. They later sold their division to Biotech Capital Group in 1981. One independent Sorcerer game designer later brought in to create Exidy arcade games was Vic Tolomei.

Exidy released &quot;Star Fire&quot; (1978), the first arcade video game with a high score table, developed by independent company Techni-Cal. In November 1979, Exidy purchased the company Vectorbeam from Cinematronics. Renamed Exidy II (or Exidy 2), the company intended to continue running the Union City manufacturing plant to exploit the vector graphics technology under license from Cinematronics. The company released a version of &quot;Tailgunner&quot; (1979) under this arrangement called &quot;Tailgunner II&quot;, but did not release any other games using vector graphics technology at the time. They would later create the vector game &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1985).

Several of Exidy’s games found success putting twists on popular arcade concepts of the time. Their game &quot;Crash&quot; (1979) was similar to Sega’s &quot;Head On&quot; (1979), which Sega subsequently threatened legal action over. They expanded on the gameplay with &quot;Targ&quot; (1980), creating a unique blend of maze and shooting elements. Their game &quot;Mouse Trap&quot; (1981) riffed on &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980) and was later ported to both the Atari VCS and Colecovision consoles by Coleco. &quot;Venture&quot; (1981) was an action-based take on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; dungeon crawling similar to &quot;Berzerk&quot; (1980).

When the coin-operated video game market started to suffer in mid-1982, Exidy diversified into different experiences. They returned to electro-mechanical games with &quot;Whirly Bucket&quot; (1983) and &quot;Tidal Wave&quot; (1983), both takes on skee ball. They created &quot;Fax&quot; (1983), a video quiz game aimed at the bar and tavern market.

In 1983, Exidy began creating light gun games, which had not been popular in the arcades since the heyday of electro-mechanical games. &quot;Crossbow&quot; (1983) was a success, establishing the Exidy 440 hardware system and prompting the release of more light gun games in the same style. The ‘c’ series consisted of &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;Combat&quot;, &quot;Crackshot&quot;, &quot;Clay Pigeon&quot;, and &quot;Chiller&quot; (1986). &quot;Chiller&quot;, like &quot;Death Race&quot; before it, attracted attention due to its violent and graphic content, including shooting body parts off of torture victims.

In 1984, Exidy invested in an interchangeable kit design called the Max-A-Flex based on the Atari 8-bit computers, specifically the 600XL. The system featured four titles licensed from computer game company First Star Software: &quot;Boulder Bash&quot;, &quot;Flip and Flop&quot;, &quot;Bristles&quot;, and &quot;Astro Chase&quot;. Max-A-Flex was subsequently abandoned after the release of these titles.

Through its entire operation, Exidy never went public nor sought venture capital investment. The company relied entirely on its products and the fundraising efforts of President Pete Kauffman to sustain the operation who liked to maintain control. This also led to a resistance to license product from other countries like Japan, relying mostly on in-house talent. In 1985, the company went into bankruptcy and former Atari coin-op head Gene Lipkin became president. A plan was hatched for Exidy to be bought by Sega, but this never materialized and Lipkin left to establish Sega Enterprises USA.

Exidy had a bonus program for engineers who created hit games, but did not start accrediting its developers until fairly late in its history. In the company’s later years, many of their game designers left to join other studios. Long term game designer Howell Ivy departed the company for Sega Enterprises USA to help start their product development apparatus. Ken Nicholson who worked on the light gun series as well as &quot;Top Secret&quot; (1986) left to join Epyx. Designer Vic Tolomei left in 1987.

The company’s last traditional video game was &quot;Who Dunit&quot; (1988). Afterwards, they moved into video poker machines and eventually into electro-mechanical redemption games. Kauffman eventually brought in his daughter Victoria and maintained control of the company until it was voluntarily dissolved in 1999.

In 2006, Mean Hamster Software acquired the license to develop new versions of Exidy’s arcade catalog. They eventually released &quot;Crossbow&quot; for IPhone in 2010. In 2015, Collectorvision Games registered the abandoned trademark for Exidy along with its logo.

In 2007, Pete Kauffman worked with the developers of the MAME arcade emulator to release a number of Exidy arcade properties for non-commercial use by community members. Over time, these games included &quot;Circus&quot;, &quot;Robot Bowl&quot;, &quot;Car Polo&quot;, &quot;Side Trak&quot;, &quot;Ripcord&quot;, &quot;Fire One&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, &quot;Star Fire&quot;, &quot;Star Fire II&quot;, &quot;Targ&quot;, &quot;Spectar&quot;, &quot;Hard Hat&quot;, &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Teeter Torture&quot;, &quot;Fax&quot;, and &quot;Top Gunner&quot;. The ROM images of these games are available to download from the MAME website after acknowledging their terms of use.

Pete Kauffman passed away on July 3, 2015.

<doc id="713006" wikidata="Q6517139" url="?curid=713006" title="Leg cutter">
<text>A leg cutter is a type of delivery in the sport of cricket. It is bowled by fast bowlers.

A bowler releases a normal spin delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the left side of the ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of his hand over the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman&#x27;s point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as &quot;cut&quot;, and the delivery is called a &quot;leg cutter&quot; because it moves &quot;away&quot; from the leg side. 

What differentiates a genuine leg cutter from a seam-up delivery that simply moves away off the seam is that it is deliberately bowled.

Leg cutters do not turn as sharply as leg breaks bowled by a leg spin bowler, but at the speed of a fast bowler even a tiny deviation can cause difficulties for the batsman. If he is not quick enough to react to the movement, the batsman can edge the ball off the outside edge of his bat, offering a catch to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders.

A fast bowler will typically use the leg cutter as a variation ball as it is most effective when it surprises the batsman. The leg cutter action can also produce a significantly slower ball with little obvious change in the bowler&#x27;s arm speed, making the delivery doubly deceptive. On the other hand, the lack of pace of the delivery may be disadvantageous. Former Australian captain Ian Chappell described Jeff Thomson&#x27;s leg cutter thus: &quot;He had this leg cutter, and you were usually pretty happy to see it, because it meant that the ball wasn&#x27;t coming at your head at 95 miles an hour.&quot;

The most prominent users of leg cutter include Alec Bedser, Fazal Mahmood and of late Terry Alderman, Carl Rackemann and Venkatesh Prasad. 

Leg cutters are much more frequently seen in indoor cricket as the physical arena in which the game is played limits the pace at which bowlers can bowl, and hence they must use other techniques to prevent the batsmen from scoring.

<doc id="713020" wikidata="Q1192295" url="?curid=713020" title="Juǀʼhoan language">
<text>Juǀʼhoan ( , ), also known as Southern or Southeastern ǃKung or ǃXun, is the southern variety of the ǃKung dialect continuum, spoken in northeastern Namibia and the Northwest District of Botswana by San Bushmen who largely identify themselves as &quot;Juǀʼhoansi&quot;. Several regional dialects are distinguished: Epukiro, Tsumǃkwe, Rundu, Omatako and ǂKxʼauǁʼein, with Tsumǃkwe being the best described and often taken as representative.

==Name==
The name &quot;Juǀʼhoan&quot; (in the plural: &quot;Juǀʼhoansi&quot;) is also rendered &quot;Žuǀʼhõa&quot; – or occasionally &quot;Zhuǀʼhõa&quot; or &quot;Dzuǀʼhõa&quot;, depending on orthography. Depending on the classification, it is considered the Southern or Southeastern variety of the ǃKung (also rendered &quot;ǃXun&quot;) language cluster. It may thus be referred to as &quot;Southern ǃKung&quot;, &quot;Southeastern ǃXun&quot;, etc. &quot;Juǀʼhoan&quot; is based on the word &#x27;people&#x27;, which is also applied to the language cluster. (see ǃKung languages for variants of those names).

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===
* When a front vowel /e/ or /i/ follows a consonant with a back vowel constraint (e.g. clicks with uvular articulation), an [ə] is inserted before the front vowel, written &#x27;a&#x27; in the orthography. For example, mi |&#x27;ae (myself) reads /mi |&#x27;əe/.
* The diphthong /oa/ may be realized as [wa].

Juǀʼhoan has five vowel qualities, which may be nasalized, glottalized, murmured, or combinations of these, and most of these possibilities occur both long and short. The qualities and may also be pharyngealized and strident (epiglottalized). Besides, it is a tonal language with four tones: very high, high, low and very low tones. Thus, there are a good 30 vowel phonemes, perhaps more, depending on one&#x27;s analysis. There are, in addition, many vowel sequences and diphthongs.

=== Consonants ===
Juǀʼhoan has an unusually large number of consonants, as typical for ǃKung. The following occur at the beginnings of roots. For brevity, only the alveolar clicks are listed with the other consonants; the complete set of clicks is found below.

Tenuis and modally voiced consonants (blue) may occur with any vowel quality. However, other consonants (grey, transcribed with a superscript diacritic to their right) do not occur in the same root as murmured, glottalized, or epiglottalized vowels.

The prevoiced aspirated and ejective consonants, both pulmonic and clicks, contain a voiceless interval, which Miller (2003) attributes to a larger glottal opening than is found in Hindustani breathy-voiced consonants. Phonetically, however, they are voice contours, starting out voiced but becoming voiceless for the aspiration or ejection.

The phonemic status of and is uncertain. may be epenthetic before vowel-initial words; alternatively, it may be that no word may begin with a vowel. occurs only in a single morpheme, the plural diminutive enclitic . and (not shown) only occur in loan words, and some accounts posit a and . Labials () are very rare initially, though is common between vowels. Velar stops (oral and nasal) are rare initially and very rare medially.

The uvulo-ejective consonants are analyzed as epiglottalized in Miller-Ockhuizen (2003). They have uvular frication and glottalization, and are similar to consonants in Nǀu described as uvular ejective by Miller et al. (2009). Their epiglottal character may be a phonetic consequence of the raised larynx involved in making them ejective.

Only a small set of consonants occur between vowels within roots. These are:

Medial (green) are very common; are rare, and the other medial consonants occur in only a very few roots, many of them loans. are generally analyzed as allophones of . However, especially may correspond to multiple root-initial consonants.

Juǀʼhoan has 48 click consonants. There are four click &quot;types&quot;: dental, lateral, alveolar, and palatal, each of which found in twelve series or &quot;accompaniments&quot; (combinations of manner, phonation, and contour). These are perfectly normal consonants in Juǀʼhoan, and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position.

As above, tenuis and modally voiced consonants (blue) may occur with any vowel quality. However, other consonants (grey, transcribed with a superscript diacritic to their right) do not occur in the same root as murmured, glottalized, or epiglottalized vowels.

Glottalized clicks occur almost exclusively before nasal vowels. This suggests they are nasalized, as in most if not all other languages with glottalized clicks. The nasalization would not be audible during the click itself due to the glottalization, which would prevent any nasal airflow, but the velum would be lowered, potentially nasalizing adjacent vowels.

The &#x27;uvularized&#x27; clicks are actually linguo-pulmonic contours, , etc. The &#x27;uvulo-ejective&#x27; clicks are heterorganic affricates, and equivalent to linguo-glottalic consonants transcribed , etc., in other languages (Miller 2011).

See Ekoka ǃXung for a related variety with a somewhat larger click inventory.

==Orthographic history==
Juǀʼhoan is the only variety of ǃKung to be written. Three orthographies have been used over the past half century, two based on pipe letters for clicks and one using only the basic Latin alphabet.

In the 1960s, the South African Department of Education set about establishing official orthographies for the languages of Southwest Africa (Namibia). Jan Snyman was selected to develop an orthography for the then-unwritten Juǀʼhoasi, which was accepted in 1969. In this orthography, the name of the language is spelled Žuǀʼhõasi. A slightly modified form (Snyman 1975) is shown below.

In the 1980s, the Bible Society of South Africa requested a new orthography, one that used only letters of the Latin alphabet, avoided diacritics as much as possible, and conformed as much as possible to the conventions of Afrikaans. This second orthography was accepted in 1987, in which the language is spelled Zjuc&#x27;hôa.

A third orthography was developed by the Juǀwa Bushman Development Foundation in 1994. This is the orthography that is currently in use in Namibia; there does not seem to be any publication in Botswana.

The three orthographies, along with the IPA, are compared below. Tone is evidently unmarked.



The modern (1994) orthography also has &quot;ih, eh, ah, oh, uh&quot; for breathy (murmured) vowels, and &quot;ihn, ahn, ohn, uhn&quot; for breathy nasal vowels. However, Snyman maintains that these are positional variants of low-tone vowels, and not needed in an orthography (at least, not if tone were marked). Glottalized vowels are written with an apostrophe in all three orthographies.

==Grammar==
Source: Dickens (2009).

Juǀ&#x27;hoan is basically isolating, being a zero-marking language in both clauses and noun phrases. The word order is SVO.

===Nouns and pronouns===
Nouns are grouped into noun classes based on animacy and species, with each class having a pronoun-set. The plural is formed by the suffixing of or or by no change, . Many nouns have irregular plurals, such as (&quot;person&quot;, plural ).

For example, the noun , &quot;dog&quot;, belongs to class 2, and may be referred to with the pronoun , whereas , &quot;forest&quot;, belongs to class 5, which has as its corresponding pronoun.

The noun classes and their pronoun-sets are as follows:

====Pronouns====
Personal and demonstrative pronouns are:

==Common words and phrases==
* – Good day
* – Good morning
* – Good evening
* - Good afternoon 
* – How are you?
* – Goodbye
* – person
* – people 
*, – water
* – Bon voyage

<text>An off cutter is a type of delivery in the game of cricket. It is bowled by fast bowlers.

A bowler releases a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in position and the first two fingers positioned on top of the cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For an off cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down the right side of the ball (from his viewpoint), in an action similar to bowling an off break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like an off break, which makes the ball deviate to the right when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman&#x27;s point of view, this deviation is to the left, or from the off side towards the leg side. This deviation is known as &quot;cut&quot;, and the delivery is called an &quot;off cutter&quot; because it moves &quot;away&quot; from the off side. What differentiates a genuine off cutter from a delivery that simply nips back off the seam is that it is deliberately bowled. A fast off cutter can also be bowled by placing the index and middle fingers on one side of the vertical seam, with the remaining fingers spread and tensed on the opposite side of the ball, as used by Brian Statham and Ray Lindwall.

Off cutters do not turn as sharply as off breaks bowled by an off spin bowler, but at the speed of a fast bowler even a tiny deviation can cause difficulties for the batsman. If he is not quick enough to react to the movement, the batsman can miss the ball with his bat and be bowled between bat and pad or out leg before wicket if struck on the pads.

A fast bowler will typically use the off cutter as a variation ball, as it is most effective when it surprises the batsman. Waqar Younis, Mustafizur Rahman, Glenn McGrath, Richard Hadlee, and Fred Trueman managed a bagful of wickets with this delivery because of the accurate lengths at which they operated, between fuller and good lengths (ball landing 2 to 3 steps in front of the batsman) at close to the off stump line. The surprise comes because, when facing rigorously accurate off-side bowlers, like those mentioned above, batters usually incorporate plans to leave the ball, or exaggerate foot movements to the pitch of the ball in anticipation.

The calling card of this delivery, for the batsman to read it in advance, is the typical wobble in the seam after ball release with the seam slanting predominantly towards the batsman. A simple way for a beginner to learn to bowl cutters is to try imparting strong back-spin to the ball by pulling down on the seam at the time of release while keeping the seam vertical.

Cutters work especially well on pitches that are rough, or when the ball lands on cracks on the surface. Such surfaces grip the seam and stop the reverse rotation, leading to considerable deviation as well as causing the ball to keep low after pitching. In the latter case, the balls are also called &#x27;shooters&#x27;. Lance Klusener used this tactic in matches in the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in one match in Calcutta towards the end of his career when he had lost some of his speed.

In test matches, bowlers tend to &#x27;work the cracks&#x27; using cutters, meaning that they try pitching the ball on cracks repeatedly with the result that few of the balls that do pitch on cracks unsettles even a well-set batsman.

In contemporary cricket, the off-cutter is primarily used as a slower ball in limited over cricket.

<doc id="713028" wikidata="Q369627" url="?curid=713028" title="Peter Atkins">
<text>Peter William Atkins (born 10 August 1940) is an English chemist and a Fellow of Lincoln College at the University of Oxford. He retired in 2007. He is a prolific writer of popular chemistry textbooks, including &quot;Physical Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Inorganic Chemistry&quot;, and &quot;Molecular Quantum Mechanics&quot;. Atkins is also the author of a number of popular science books, including &quot;Atkins&#x27; Molecules&quot;, &quot;Galileo&#x27;s Finger: The Ten Great Ideas of Science&quot; and &quot;On Being&quot;.

==Career==
Atkins left school (Dr Challoner&#x27;s Grammar School, Amersham) at fifteen and took a job at Monsanto as a laboratory assistant. He studied for A-levels by himself and gained a place, following a last-minute interview, at the University of Leicester.

Atkins studied chemistry there, obtaining a BSc degree in chemistry, and a PhD degree in 1964 for research into electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and other aspects of theoretical chemistry. Atkins then took a postdoctoral position at UCLA as a Harkness Fellow of the Commonwealth fund. He returned to Britain in 1965 as a fellow and tutor of Lincoln College, Oxford, and lecturer in physical chemistry (later, professor of physical chemistry). In 1969, he won the Royal Society of Chemistry&#x27;s Meldola Medal. In 1996 he was awarded the Title of Distinction of Professor of Chemistry. He retired in 2007, and since then has been a full-time author.

He has honorary doctorates from the University of Utrecht, the University of Leicester (where he sits on the university Court), Mendeleev University in Moscow, and Kazan State Technological University.

He was a member of the Council of the Royal Institution and the Royal Society of Chemistry. He was the founding chairman of IUPAC Committee on Chemistry Education, and is a trustee of a variety of charities.

Atkins has lectured in quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry, and thermodynamics courses (up to graduate level) at the University of Oxford. He is a patron of the Oxford University Scientific Society.

In 2016 Atkins received the James T. Grady-James H. Stack Award for Interpreting Chemistry for the Public from the American Chemical Society.

==Views on religion==

Atkins is a well-known atheist. He has written and spoken on issues of humanism, atheism, and conflicts between science and religion. According to Atkins, whereas religion scorns the power of human comprehension, science respects it.

He was the first Senior Member of the Oxford University Secular Society, a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK (formerly known as the British Humanist Association) and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. He is also a member of the advisory board of The Reason Project, a US-based charitable foundation devoted to spreading scientific knowledge and secular values in society. The organisation is led by fellow atheist and author Sam Harris. Atkins has regularly participated in debates with theists, including John Lennox, Alister McGrath, Stephen C. Meyer, Hugh Ross, William Lane Craig, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Richard Swinburne.

In December 2006, Atkins was interviewed by journalist Rod Liddle in a UK television documentary on atheism called &quot;The Trouble with Atheism&quot;. In the documentary, Liddle asked Atkins: &quot;Give me your views on the existence, or otherwise, of God.&quot; Atkins replied: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s fairly straightforward: There isn&#x27;t one. And there&#x27;s no evidence for one, no reason to believe that there is one, and so I don&#x27;t believe that there is one. And I think that it is rather foolish that people do think that there is one.&quot; In July 2016, Atkins was quoted as stating, “We are a hiccup on the way from one oblivion to another oblivion.”

Atkins is known for his use of strident language in criticising religion: He appeared in the 2008 documentary-style film &quot;&quot;, in which he told interviewer Ben Stein that religion was &quot;a fantasy&quot; and &quot;completely empty of any explanatory content. It is also evil&quot;.

In 2007, Atkins&#x27;s position on religion was described by Colin Tudge in an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being non-scientific. In the same article, Atkins was also described as being &quot;more hardline than Richard Dawkins&quot;, and of deliberately choosing to ignore Peter Medawar&#x27;s famous adage that &quot;Science is the art of the soluble&quot;.

==Personal life==
Atkins married Judith Kearton in 1964 and they had one daughter, Juliet (born 1970). They divorced in 1983. In 1991, he married fellow scientist Susan Greenfield (later Baroness Greenfield). They divorced in 2005. In 2008, he married Patricia-Jean Nobes (née Brand).

Whitaker spent his entire career with the Detroit Tigers. From 1977 to 1995, he appeared in 2,390 games for the Tigers, third most in franchise history behind Ty Cobb and Al Kaline. He helped the Tigers win the 1984 World Series, was selected as an American League All-Star five consecutive years (1983–1987) and won four Silver Slugger Awards (1983–1985, 1987) and three Gold Glove Awards (1983–1985). The Tigers retired his No. 1 jersey in August 2022.

Born in Brooklyn and raised in Virginia, Whitaker was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in 1975. He spent three years in the minor leagues and was selected in 1976 as the most valuable player in the Florida State League. He made his Major League Baseball debut in September 1977 and won the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1978. Whitaker won the Tiger of the Year award in 1983 after hitting .320 and tallying 206 hits. He repeated as Tiger of the Year in 1989 when he hit a career-high 28 home runs.

Whitaker and shortstop Alan Trammell played beside each other for 19 seasons and are the longest-running double play combination in major-league history. Whitaker was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Early life==
Whitaker was born in Brooklyn, New York City, in 1957. In the late 1950s, his mother, Marion Arlene Williams, moved to Martinsville, Virginia. Whitaker was raised in Martinsville by his mother and grandmother. Asked in 1979 about his father, Whitaker said, &quot;He&#x27;s never done anything for me. I don&#x27;t hate him. I haven&#x27;t got time to hate anybody. I just don&#x27;t care to meet him. There&#x27;s nothing emotionally happening between us.&quot;

Whitaker attended Martinsville High School. He played for the school&#x27;s baseball team as a middle infielder and pitcher. Whitaker graduated in 1975 and committed to play college baseball for Ferrum College.

==Professional baseball player==

===Minor leagues===
The Detroit Tigers selected Whitaker in the fifth round, with the 99th overall selection, of the 1975 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Tigers rather than attend college. He made his professional debut in 1975 for the Bristol Tigers of the Rookie-level Appalachian League.

Whitaker was the starting third baseman in 1976 for the Lakeland Tigers of the Class A Florida State League. Whitaker batted .297, had 48 stolen bases, and 62 runs batted in, and was named the league&#x27;s most valuable player. In one game with Lakeland, he stole five bases, including three steals of home. Because of his &quot;sweet swing&quot; with the bat, Whitaker was given the nickname &quot;Sweet Lou&quot; while playing for Lakeland. Lakeland manager Jim Leyland said at the time: &quot;For a youngster he&#x27;s got a lot of poise and self-assurance. He&#x27;s confident of his ability to play and nothing seems to bother him.&quot;

After the 1976 season, the Tigers sent Whitaker to instructional camp to convert him into a second baseman. Whitaker said at the time: &quot;Detroit needs a second baseman. And even though I&#x27;ve never played that position I&#x27;m ready to try. I&#x27;ve got Eddie Brinkman teaching me and he&#x27;s good. I hope that I can do as well.&quot; Brinkman later recalled, &quot;Whitaker is such a natural athlete that he took to second base right away.&quot;

During winter ball before the 1977 season, the Tigers also paired Whitaker with shortstop Alan Trammell. In 1977, they both played for the Montgomery Rebels of the Double-A Southern League. Whitaker and Trammell were both named to the Southern League all-star team. Whitaker compiled a .280 batting average with 38 stolen bases, 58 bases on balls, and a .374 on-base percentage.

===Rookie of the Year===
In September 1977, the Tigers called up Whitaker and Trammell. Both made their major league debuts on September 9 against the Boston Red Sox. Whitaker went three-for-five with a stolen base, hit a double off the Green Monster at Fenway Park, and registered his first run batted in (RBI) against the Baltimore Orioles. He appeared in 11 games at the end of the 1977 season, compiling a .250 batting average and .333 on-base percentage.

In 1978, manager Ralph Houk started the season with Whitaker and Trammell platooning with Steve Dillard and Mark Wagner. By May, Whitaker and Trammell had established themselves as every day starters. Houk noted at the time, &quot;Those two kids have just been great. They have played absolutely outstanding defensive ball. You saw Whitaker make a play very few second basemen in the league would have made.&quot; By August, Houk was effusive in his praise: &quot;They&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve ever seen for their age. On the double plays, knowing where the ball is going to be, that&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t teach.&quot;

In his first full season, Whitaker appeared in 139 games, 123 of them as the Tigers&#x27; starting second baseman. He turned 95 double plays, scored 71 runs, stole 20 bases, and compiled a .285 batting average with a .361 on-base percentage. Detroit fans also began a long tradition in 1978, chanting, &quot;Loooooooou&quot; when Whitaker came to the plate. Whitaker recalled that he initially thought the crowd was booing him.

In November 1978, he was voted by the baseball writers as the winner of the American League Rookie of the Year Award. Whitaker received 21 of the 28 first-place votes, easily defeating Paul Molitor (three votes), Carney Lansford (two votes), Trammell (one vote), and Rich Gale (one vote). At the time, Whitaker said, &quot;This is the biggest moment of my career. Winning the award makes me proud of myself for the things I have done.&quot;

===1979 to 1982===

Whitaker had another strong season in 1979. He compiled a .286 batting average, drew 78 bases on balls (boosting his on-base percentage to .395), and stole 20 bases.

In 1980, Whitaker slumped at the plate, his batting average dropping 53 points from the previous season to .233.

In the strike-shortened 1981 season, Whitaker led the American League with 109 games played. His 354 assists led the league&#x27;s second basemen and ranked third among all players in the league.

After hitting no more than five home runs in any of his previous seasons, Whitaker began to hit for power in 1982, tallying 15 home runs, eight triples, and a .286 batting average. He also had one of his best defensive seasons in 1982, leading the league&#x27;s second basemen with 470 assists, 120 double plays turned, and a .988 fielding percentage. His 1.9 defensive wins above replacement (dWAR) rating ranked fourth highest in the American League among players at all positions.

===All-Star in 1983===
Whitaker enjoyed perhaps his finest overall season in 1983. He appeared in a career-high 161 games and compiled a .320 batting average and 206 hits, both of which were career highs and ranked third highest in the American League. He also had 40 doubles, six triples, 12 home runs, 72 runs batted in (RBI), 94 runs scored, and a .380 on-base percentage. His 1983 wins above replacement (WAR) rating of 6.7 was the sixth best in the American League.

He was selected for the first of five times to the American League All-Star team. He was selected as a reserve and entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning. He hit a triple that landed at the base of the 401-foot marker in Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park and collected a run batted in as Ron Kittle scored on the play. At the end of the 1983 season, Whitaker won the following awards:
* On October 18, &quot;The Sporing News&quot; selected Whitaker as the second baseman on its annual post-season all-star team.
* On October 28, the Detroit chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America selected Whitaker for its &quot;Tiger of the Year&quot; award. Whitaker received 29 of 44 first-place votes, well ahead of Jack Morris who received seven first-place votes.
* On November 16, Whitaker was selected by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; for the American League Silver Slugger Award, as the best offensive player at second base.
* On December 6, Whitaker was selected as the Gold Glove Award winner as the best defensive second baseman in the American League. It was the first time in the history of the award that three players from a single team won Gold Gloves, as Alan Trammell and Lance Parrish also won won the award at their positions.

Whitaker also finished eighth in the voting for the 1983 American League Most Valuable Player Award.

===World champion in 1984===
In 1984, the Tigers opened the season with a 35–5 record and went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals in the 1984 American League Championship Series and the San Diego Padres in the 1984 World Series. Whitaker was the team&#x27;s leadoff hitter and starting second baseman. He appeared in 142 games at second base and compiled a .289 batting average and 13 home runs. For the second consecutive year, he was selected as an American League All-Star and won Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards.

Whitaker hit a double and scored in the first inning of Game 1 of the World Series. He hit .278 in the Series with a .409 on-base percentage, scoring six runs in the five games.

Whitaker&#x27;s second daughter, Sarah, was born on October 14, 1984, the same day Detroit won the fifth and final game of the World Series.

===Power surge in 1985===
In 1985, Whitaker set a record for Detroit second basemen with 21 home runs, while topping 100 runs scored for the first time in his career (102).

Whitaker was selected to play in the All-Star game for the third consecutive year, but forgot to pack his uniform. Making the discovery just before the game, he had to make do with replica merchandise available for purchase at the park. He obtained an adjustable mesh hat and a blank jersey. He finished off his outfit by scrawling his number on the back in magic marker (or, by some accounts, having a fan do so for him). The Smithsonian requested the jersey and it remains a part of their collection.

===1986 to 1992===

In 1986, Whitaker hit another 20 homers and was part of a Tigers infield in which all four members (Whitaker, Darrell Evans, Alan Trammell and Darnell Coles) hit at least 20 home runs. During the 1986 All-Star Game, he was one of the five players struck out consecutively by National League pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, tying Carl Hubbell&#x27;s mark. Whitaker earlier hit a two-run homer in the game, which the American League won 3–2.

In 1987, Whitaker scored a career-high 110 runs and won his final Silver Slugger award at second base as the Tigers edged out the Toronto Blue Jays on the final day of the regular season to win the AL East Division title.

Whitaker reached career highs with 28 homers and 85 RBI in 1989, one of four times he reached the 20-HR plateau, upping his record for the most homers in a season by a Tiger second baseman. Whitaker now shares the season record with Ian Kinsler, who hit 28 homers in 2016 as the Tigers regular second baseman.

Although 1990 saw Whitaker post his lowest batting average in ten years (.237), he didn&#x27;t let it affect his defense. On the season, Whitaker handled 664 chances and committed only 6 errors, for a career-best .991 fielding percentage. His 1990 range factor was 5.71, well above the league average of 5.23.

In 1991, Whitaker&#x27;s 23 home runs and career-high 90 walks helped him to an .881 OPS, the highest of his career to that point. Whitaker reached three career milestones in 1992, recording his 2,000th game, 2,000th hit, and his 200th home run.

===Final seasons: 1993 to 1995===
In December 1992, after being recruited to join the Atlanta Braves, Whitaker and the Tigers agreed to a three-year, $10-million contract. Whitaker finished his career with three seasons of strong offensive production. In 1993, Whitaker appeared in 119 games, 110 of them at second base. He posted a .290 batting average and a career-best .412 on-base percentage and tallied 67 RBIs. In 1994, he appeared in 92 games, 83 of them at second base. He compiled a .301 batting average, his first .300 season since 1983.

In May 1995, on his 38th birthday, and after missing the first 14 games of the season with a sore shoulder, Whitaker announced his intention to retire at the end of the season. He said at the time: &quot;I&#x27;m tired of being sore. . . . I&#x27;ll be playing softball next year.&quot; In his final season, he appeared in 84 games, including 65 games at second base and eight as a designated hitter. He compiled a .293 batting average with 14 doubles, 14 home runs, and career-high .890 on-base plus slugging. 

Whitaker played his final game on October 1, 1995, at Camden Yards in Baltimore. When Whitaker and Trammell took the field in the bottom of the first inning, the Orioles&#x27; double-play combination of Cal Ripken Jr. and Jeff Huson presented Trammell and Whitaker with bases which they held above their heads as the Baltimore crowd cheered.

===Whitaker and Trammell===
Whitaker and Alan Trammell played beside each other at second base and shortstop for 1,918 games over 19-major league seasons, making them the longest running double play combination in major-league history. They started playing together in an instructional league between the 1976 and 1977 seasons. They made their major-league debuts together on September 9, 1977. For the next 19 years, they formed the Tigers&#x27; keystone combination. They became associated with each other on and off the field. In December 1983, they made cameo appearances as themselves on the television show &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, starring Tom Selleck. Selleck&#x27;s character was a Tigers fan, as is Selleck himself. During the 1984 World Series, Trammell described his partnership with Whitaker:Lou is my partner. We&#x27;ve got more than just a relationship. Our names are linked together now. It&#x27;s like a marriage. We&#x27;ve become a couple. When people say, &#x27;Trammell,&#x27; they say &#x27;and Whitaker,&#x27; When they say &#x27;Whitaker,&#x27; they say, &#x27;and Trammell.&#x27; If they ever break us up, its going to be a very weird day. It&#x27;d be like getting divorced.&quot;
When Trammell was inducted in 2018 into the Baseball Hall of Fame, he said: &quot;For 19 years, Lou Whitaker and I formed the longest running double play combination in the history of baseball. I doubt that record will ever be broken. Lou, it was an honor and a pleasure to have played alongside you for all those years, and my hope is someday you&#x27;ll be up here as well.&quot;

===Career statistics===
Whitaker was an effective leadoff man, adept at drawing walks (averaging 81 per 162 games), quick on the bases, and able to drive the ball with power to all fields. In his 19-year career, Whitaker batted .276 with a .363 on-base percentage, 244 home runs, 1,084 RBI, 1,386 runs, 2,369 hits, 420 doubles, 65 triples, and 143 stolen bases in 2,390 games. Defensively, he recorded a .984 fielding percentage. His career Wins Above Replacement (WAR) of 75.1 ranks 51st all-time among position players, and is higher than all but six second basemen (all six of whom are in the Hall of Fame).

Whitaker is also one of only 19 players ever to hit a ball over the roof of Tiger Stadium.

==Baseball legacy and honors==

Whitaker appeared in 2,390 games for the Detroit Tigers, third most in franchise history behind Ty Cobb and Al Kaline. He also ranks fourth in major-league history with 2,308 games played at second base. He remains among the Tigers&#x27; all-time leaders in double plays (first, 1,527), assists (second, 6,653), bases on balls (second, 1,197), runs scored (third, 1,386), strikeouts (third, 1,099), wins above replacement (WAR) by position players (fourth, 75.1), and defensive WAR (second, 16.2).

Bill James, in &quot;The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, rated Whitaker as the thirteenth-best second baseman of all time. Baseball writer Craig Calcaterra wrote that Whitaker was not flashy, but caught everything hit his way, effortlessly turned double plays and made strong, steady throws that &quot;defined great second base defense.&quot;

In 2000, Whitaker was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

In December 2019, the Tigers announced that they would retire Whitaker&#x27;s No. 1 jersey sometime in 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the ceremony being postponed. The retirement ceremony ultimately took place in August 2022. At the time, Whitaker said: &quot;I truly tell you, this will be one of the greatest moments of my life. Just knowing that my number will be retired and I&#x27;ll get a chance to see my name on the wall with some legends from Tiger history. What a great honor.&quot; In his speech honoring Whitaker, Alan Trammell, whose number 3 was retired in 2018, stated: &quot;For four years, I&#x27;ve been uncomfortable. I have been extremely honored and grateful to have my number 3 retired. But there wouldn&#x27;t be a number 3 on the wall without the number 1.&quot;

Whitaker was considered for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) in 2001 but received only 15 votes (2.9%). He was later considered by the Modern Baseball Era Committee for the induction class, but fell short of the required 75% threshold for induction, receiving six votes (37.5%) from the 16-member committee. Whitaker&#x27;s exclusion from the Hall (particularly him falling off the BBWAA ballot after a single year) has been widely criticized by baseball fans, citing that he meets multiple Hall of Fame standards such as him reaching 2,000 hits and playing with one team his entire career, and his 75.1 Wins Above Replacement are the most of any player in the live-ball era not already inducted barring those excluded due to a controversy.

==Family and later years==
Whitaker married Crystal McCreary in November 1979 at Detroit&#x27;s Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They have four daughters, Asia, Angela, Jessica, and Sarah.

While playing with the Tigers, Whitaker was introduced to the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses by teammate Chet Lemon. After converting to the religion, Whitaker removed the Canadian and American flags from his batting helmet. After retiring from baseball, Whitaker &quot;routinely spent at least 840 hours a year&quot; on missionary work for the church.

In April 1993, Whitaker&#x27;s pregnant half-sister Judith Grey was killed by gunfire from a passing car in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Emergency workers opened her chest and squeezed the heart to maintain blood flow to the baby, which was born alive at the hospital.

After retiring as a player, Whitaker became an instructor for the Tigers during their spring training sessions in Lakeland, Florida, where he helped coaching hitters through the 2009 season. He and the Tigers parted ways in 2010 by mutual agreement.

<doc id="713032" wikidata="Q385239" url="?curid=713032" title="European Monetary System">
<text>The European Monetary System (EMS) was a multilateral adjustable exchange rate agreement in which most of the nations of the European Economic Community (EEC) linked their currencies to prevent large fluctuations in relative value. It was initiated in 1979 under then President of the European Commission Roy Jenkins as an agreement among the Member States of the EEC to foster monetary policy co-operation among their Central Banks for the purpose of managing inter-community exchange rates and financing exchange market interventions.

The EMS functioned by adjusting nominal and real exchange rates, thus establishing closer monetary cooperation and creating a zone of monetary stability. As part of the EMS, the EEC established the first European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) which calculated exchange rates for each currency and a European Currency Unit (ECU): an accounting currency unit that was a weighted average of the currencies of the 12 participating states. The ERM let exchange rates to fluctuate within fixed margins, allowing for some variation while limiting economic risks and maintaining liquidity.

The European Monetary System lasted from 1979 to 1999, when it was succeeded by the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and exchange rates for Eurozone countries were fixed against the new currency the Euro. The ERM was replaced at the same time with the current Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II).

== History ==
===Background, 1960 to 1971===
The origins of the EMS can be traced back to the end of 1960 when the Heads of the member states of the EEC, known as the European Council today, met in the Hague and agreed to begin moving toward the goal of a single European economy. In 1969, the European Council decided to create an economic and monetary union to be implemented by 1980.

===1972: the Werner Report is published and EEC countries peg their currencies===
A group of experts, led by the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Luxembourg, Pierre Werner, met and produced the Werner Report, which was published on 8 October 1970 and outlined the structure and function of the EMS. On the basis of the Werner Report, the EEC began moving to a single economy in three stages. The final stage economy was to have a fixed exchange rate but no single currency. After the abandonment of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the EEC took action. In October 1972, the EEC&#x27;s Paris summit adopted the recommendations of the Werner Report and, as a result, the EEC currencies were adjustably pegged to one another in a scheme known as the snake in the tunnel. The currency snake established a single currency fluctuation band of +/-2.25%, however Italy left the snake already in 1973.

===The EMS is created===
At a meeting of the EEC in Brussels on 5 December 1978, French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt successfully championed the EMS, which was implemented via resolution at the meeting. The EMS officially entered into force on 13 March 1979 with the participation of eight Member States (France, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Netherlands, Germany and Italy).

===Creation of the European Currency Unit===

European currency exchange rate stability has been one of the most important objectives of European policymakers since the Second World War. Between 1982 and 1987, European currencies displayed a range of stable and unstable behavior. For example, the Dutch guilder remained quite stable with respect to the Mark, the Italian lira exhibited a sharp downward trend throughout the life of the EMS, and the French franc, the Belgian franc, the Danish krone and the Irish pound all escaped trends of successive devaluations to emerge more stable. At the same time that the EMS was created, the Council of the European Union Ministers created a new monetary unit, the European Currency Unit (ECU). The ECU was the official monetary unit of the EMS, but it was purely a composite accounting unit, not a real currency. The ECU&#x27;s value was based on the weighted average of a basket of 12 European currencies; the Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, German mark, Spanish peseta, French franc, Finnish markka, Greek drachma, Irish pound, Italian lira, Luxembourgish franc, Dutch guilder, and Portuguese escudo. The exchange rates for member nations&#x27; currencies were based on their value relative to the ECU.

===German monetary policy dominates===
The EMS was similar to the Bretton Woods system, in that it pegged member currencies within a fluctuation band. Furthermore, the EMS came to be &#x27;de facto&#x27; centered on the Deutschmark similarly to how the Bretton Woods system had been based on the US Dollar. Although no currency was designated as an anchor, the Deutsche Mark and German central bank emerged as the anchor of the EMS. Germany emerged as the dominant player within the EMS, setting its monetary policy largely autonomously while other ERM members attempted to converge on the German standard of the Deutsche Mark, causing a power imbalance within the EMS. German monetary policy dictated the policy of the European Monetary System, because of its strong growth rate and the low-inflation policies of the German central bank. The influence of the US dollar also entailed strong disturbances within the EMS. Eventually, this situation led to dissatisfaction in most countries and was one of the primary forces behind the drive to a monetary union.

===Changing operating principles and preparing for the Euro===
The EMS went through two distinct phases. During the first period, from 1979 to 1986, the EMS allowed member countries a certain degree of autonomy in monetary policy by restricting the movement of capital. The second period, from 1987 to 1992, the EMS was more rigid. In 1988, a committee was set up under EEC President Jacques Delors to begin changing the EMS to provide favorable starting conditions for the transition to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The Delors plan was a three-stage process that lead to a single European currency under the control of a European Central Bank.

===1992 crisis===
The year 1990 saw a crisis in the EMS. The European single market had been created in 1986 with the main goal of removing control on capital movements. Periodic adjustments raised the value of strong currencies and lowered those of weaker ones, and national interest rates were changed to keep the currencies within a narrow range. In early 1990, the European Monetary System was strained by the differing economic policies and conditions of its members, especially the newly reunified Germany, and Britain, which had initially declined to join, subsequently joining in 1990. The opt-out of Denmark from the EMU in 1992 and exchange rate adjustments of the currencies from weaker countries by the EMS also contributed to the crisis.

Speculative attacks on the French franc during the following year led to the Brussels compromise in August 1993 which broadened the fluctuation band from +/-2.25% to +/-15% for all the participating currencies. The German central bank reduced interest rates and the UK and Italy were affected by large capital outflows. In the aftermath of the crisis, Italy and the UK both withdrew from the ERM in September 1992.

According to Barry Eichengreen, there were three primary reasons for the crisis:

# Inadequate harmonization of past policies: Italy, Spain and the UK had not brought their inflation rates down to the levels of other EMS members, which contributed to competitive imbalances
# Inadequate harmonization of future policies: rising unemployment (stemming in part from German unification) reduced the credibility of the governments with high unemployment rates and weak public support, which led markets to attack the currencies of those countries
# Speculative pressures: The Maastricht Treaty provided the conditions for self-fulfilling speculative attacks

== Criticism ==
Michael J Artis (1987) assessed the credibility of the EMS, stating that the EMS had low credibility during the first eight years of its history. Artis also states that the system demonstrated its resilience despite working relatively non-smoothly. He also remarked that EMS was supposed to have improved the stability of the intra-EMS bilateral exchange rates but that the improvement was less marked for effective rates when compared to nominal rates and stability weakened with the passage of time.

Another criticism was laid by Paul De Grauwe (1987) about the credibility of the EMS policy. In 1979, when EMS entered into force, GDP growth rate, investment growth rate, the stability of exchange rate, and interest rates declined dramatically. In 1980, there was a rise in unemployment after EMS implementation. Both the average EMS unemployment rate and the inflation differential had a significant effect on EMS credibility. Macroeconomically, small EMS countries experienced larger declines in investment, whereas before the EMS they had experienced relatively faster growth rates.

The EMS did not achieve long-term stability in real exchange rates. This is significant because real exchange rates are more important than nominal exchange rates when it comes to investment, output, export, and import decisions. The EMS only succeeded in reducing short-term changes in bilateral exchange rates and nominal exchange rates. Indeed, inflation rates continued to differ widely among EEC countries. For example, Germany experienced an inflation rate of 3 percent while Italy&#x27;s inflation rate reached 13 percent.

Both nominal and real interest rates increased substantially after 1979 and EMS provided little benefit to its members in terms of monetary and financial stability. Furthermore, there was not enough cooperation among the member states to fully realize the potential benefits of the EMS. The smaller EMS economies such as Belgium, Denmark, and Ireland possessed short-term credibility but lack of long-term credibility. On the other hand, Germany and the Netherlands had the most long-term credibility, due to their low inflation records.

Additionally, Axel A. Weber (1991) claims that the EMS was a de facto Deutsche Mark zone. Moreover, it was often called “tying one&#x27;s hands” because the policy adopted a fixed exchange rate which had short-run effects. The German central bank independently chose its monetary policy whilst all remaining EMS member countries&#x27; hands were tied on monetary policy and they were simply forced to target their exchange rates to the German mark.

<text>Charles August &quot;Swede&quot; Risberg (October 13, 1894 – October 13, 1975) was a Major League Baseball shortstop. He played for the Chicago White Sox from 1917 to 1920 and is best known for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.

==Background==
Charles Risberg was born and raised in San Francisco, California. He had very little education growing up and withdrew from school in the third grade. However, he soon developed a reputation as a good semipro pitcher and began his professional baseball career in 1912.

Risberg soon converted to shortstop. In 1914, he hit .366 in the Class D Union Association and was acquired by the Venice Tigers of the Pacific Coast League. He was the club&#x27;s utility infielder in 1915 and 1916, gaining acclaim for his defensive skills. He was then bought by the American League&#x27;s Chicago White Sox in early 1917.

==Major League Baseball==

Risberg made his debut on April 11, 1917 for the White Sox. He was a below-average hitter, but because of his superb defensive abilities, he won the full-time job at shortstop. Late in the season, Risberg experienced a terrible slump, and he only had two plate appearances, both as a pinch hitter, when the White Sox beat the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series.

The next season, Risberg briefly returned to California to work in a shipyard as part of the war effort. Although his job was termed essential and enabled him to avoid the draft, it consisted largely of playing baseball, as he batted .308 for the shipyard ballclub.

Risberg returned to the White Sox for the pennant-winning 1919 season. In September, he received positive press in the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;, which labeled him a &quot;miracle man&quot; who had &quot;blossomed out as a wonder&quot; after making four plays that were &quot;phenomenal.&quot; Chicago was heavy favorites in 1919 World Series versus the Cincinnati Reds. However, a group of White Sox players, including Risberg, agreed to intentionally lose the series in exchange for monetary payments from a network of gamblers. Risberg was one of the ringleaders, helping to convince some of his teammates to participate in the scheme. In the eight-game series, he was 2 for 25 at the plate and committed a World Series-record eight errors.

Risberg received $15,000 for his role in the fix, an amount that was more than four times his regular-season salary. The scandal broke in late 1920, and although the eight players were acquitted in the trial that followed, they were all banned from organized baseball by commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

==Later years==
Risberg continued to play semipro baseball for a decade after his banishment. According to one source, &quot;he came to Minnesota in 1922 with a traveling team called the Mesaba Range Black Sox, which featured two other members of the 1919 Black Sox team: Happy Felsch and Lefty Williams.&quot; He played throughout the midwestern United States and Canada. Columbus, North Dakota newspaper reports claimed that Risberg played part of the 1927 season with a traveling team called Dellage&#x27;s Cubans based in Lignite, North Dakota.

In 1926, Risberg was called to testify about a 1919 gambling scandal involving Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker. Although he presented no evidence regarding the 1919 scandal, he claimed that in 1917 he had collected money from other White Sox players to give to the Detroit Tigers so that the Tigers would intentionally lose some games. However, his story was contradicted by more than 30 other men and it was disregarded.

Risberg also worked on a dairy farm. After his baseball career ended, he eventually ran a tavern and lumber business in the Northwest. During his playing days, he had been spiked by an opposing player and the injury never properly healed, causing an eventual amputation. At the end of his life, he lived with his son and remained an avid baseball fan.

Risberg died in Red Bluff, California in 1975, on his 81st birthday. He was the last living Black Sox player.

Risberg was portrayed by actor Don Harvey in the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot;.

<doc id="713051" wikidata="Q523519" url="?curid=713051" title="Mary Marvel">
<text>Mary Marvel (also known as Lady Shazam and Mary Shazam) is a fictional character and superheroine originally published by Fawcett Comics and now owned by DC Comics. Created by Otto Binder and Marc Swayze, she first appeared in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #18 (cover-dated Dec. 1942). The character is a member of the Marvel / Shazam Family of heroes associated with the superhero Shazam / Captain Marvel and is one of the first female spin-offs of a major male superhero, and predates the introduction of Supergirl (also created by Otto Binder) by more than a decade.

In &quot;Shazam!&quot; and related titles, Mary Marvel is the alter-ego of teenager Mary Batson (adopted name Mary Bromfield) who was granted the powers of the Wizard Shazam alongside her brother, Billy. After DC acquired the rights to Fawcett Comics&#x27; characters in 1972, Mary Marvel began appearing in DC Comics, co-starring in DC series such as &quot;Shazam!&quot; (1973–1978) and &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; (1995–1999). For a time, two limited series from 2007 to 2009, &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, depict an evil version of Mary Marvel (calling herself Black Mary) having acquired powers from Black Adam and Apokoliptian supervillain DeSaad. Following the 2011 New 52 reboot, the character is instead changed to being the eldest of Billy Batson&#x27;s foster siblings under the name &quot;Mary Bromfield&quot; whose powers were shared by Billy. Following the &quot;Lazarus Planet&quot; event, the character&#x27;s powers are instead derived from divine female benefactors led by the newly ascended Hippolyta, removing her connection to the Wizard.

Mary Bromfield and her superhero alter-ego both made their cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe 2019 film &quot;Shazam!&quot;, played by Grace Fulton and Michelle Borth, respectively. Fulton returned in the sequel, &quot;Shazam! Fury of the Gods,&quot; playing both parts.

==Publication history==

===Fawcett Comics===

Mary Marvel was introduced into Fawcett Comics&#x27; Marvel Family franchise a year after a young male counterpart, Captain Marvel Jr., made his debut. Artist Marc Swayze based Mary Marvel&#x27;s design and personality upon American actress Judy Garland. Mary was introduced in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #18 as Mary Bromfield, a girl who discovers she is the long lost sister of Captain Marvel&#x27;s alter ego Billy Batson.

In &quot;Superhero Comics of the Golden Age&quot;, Mike Benton writes:


Soon after her introduction, Mary Marvel headlined &quot;Wow Comics&quot;, and by 1945 had her own &quot;Mary Marvel&quot; book. She also appeared in &quot;The Marvel Family&quot; book with Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. In her solo adventures, Mary soon gained sidekicks in her kindly Uncle Marvel, who was not actually her uncle nor a Marvel, and his similarly nonpowered niece, Freckles Marvel. Uncle Marvel was eventually made the Marvel Family&#x27;s manager, and also served as Mary&#x27;s guardian.

Just before the Marvel Family&#x27;s adventures ceased publication in 1953, Mary Marvel&#x27;s costume and appearance were altered: the neckline of her blouse was lowered slightly, her hair was shortened, and she now wore yellow slippers instead of the customary Marvel Family yellow boots. After Fawcett canceled their superhero comics line because of a copyright infringement lawsuit with National Comics (later DC Comics), Mary Marvel hosted a puzzle page drawn by C. C. Beck on page 33 of &quot;Mysteries of Unexplored World&quot; issue 1 (Charlton Comics August 1956). After that, Mary and her teammates went unseen for years.

===DC Comics===

====1973–1985====
In 1972, DC Comics licensed the rights to the Marvels, and revived them in a new comic series called &quot;Shazam!&quot;. Mary, Cap, and Junior appeared in both new stories and reprints of their classic stories. According to Shazam #1 the Sivanas had put the Marvel family into suspended animation for 20 years, along with themselves (by mistake) and much of the supporting cast. The comic book was canceled by 1978, and the &quot;Shazam!&quot; stories were relegated to the back pages of &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot; (from 1979 to 1982) and &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (from 1982 to 1983). After the 1985 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; miniseries, Captain Marvel&#x27;s origin was rebooted in the &quot;Shazam: The New Beginning&quot; miniseries in 1987. The Marvel Family was written out of the &quot;Shazam!&quot; mythos, and neither Mary Batson nor Mary Marvel appeared in DC Comics for several years.

====1994–1999====
Mary Batson was reintroduced in &quot;The Power of Shazam!&quot; graphic novel by Jerry Ordway in 1994. An ongoing series followed in the next year, and Mary Marvel was introduced into the modern DC Universe with a new origin story in &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; #4.

When calling upon her powers, Mary is transformed into an adult resembling her late mother (in the same way that Billy resembles his father when in Marvel form). Mary shares the title of Captain Marvel with her brother. Various characters in the series distinguish the two by gender when addressing them, addressing Mary as &quot;the lady Captain Marvel&quot;.

At first, Mary&#x27;s costume was the same as her original one. However, beginning with &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; #28, Mary donned a white costume to distinguish herself from her brother. The color change was retained for most future uses of the character during the next decade.

====2000s====
After the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; series ended in 1999, Mary&#x27;s superpowered alter ego was officially rechristened &quot;Mary Marvel.&quot; In 2002 she had lunch with Supergirl in &quot;The Clubhouse of Solitude&quot;, in the spoof graphic anthology &quot;Bizarro Comics&quot;. Since then, she has guest-starred in both &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Supergirl&quot; comics. In 2003, Mary became a member of an offshoot of the Justice League known as the Super Buddies in the &quot;Formerly Known as the Justice League&quot; miniseries, which juxtaposed her Golden Age-era personality with the modern-day world for comic effect.

Mary Marvel appears briefly in several stories relating to DC&#x27;s 2005–2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; crossover. Mary also appeared in DC&#x27;s weekly limited series &quot;52&quot;, with her most substantial appearance being in &quot;52&quot; #16 as the maid of honor at the wedding of Black Adam and Isis, two &quot;Shazam!&quot;-related characters. She was defeated by Black Adam during World War III (DC Comics) along with the other Marvels.

In 2006, DC began a revamp of the &quot;Shazam!&quot; mythos with Judd Winick and Howard Porter&#x27;s &quot;Trials of Shazam!&quot; limited series. The series began with a preview within the pages of &quot;Brave New World&quot; #1 in June 2006, in which Mary Batson loses her powers, suffers a three-mile fall, and falls into a coma. This set up Mary&#x27;s appearances as a main character in &quot;Countdown&quot;, a weekly DC series which served as the successor to &quot;52&quot;. During the course of the series, head writer Paul Dini and his collaborators had Mary acquire the powers of Black Adam, which give her a new look including a form-fitting long-sleeved black uniform and skirt with black lace-up boots. While the series tracked the character&#x27;s struggle between good and evil, due to manipulation by Eclipso and Granny Goodness (promotional material for the series used the catchphrase &quot;Seduction of the Innocent,&quot; a reference to Fredric Wertham&#x27;s book of the same title), Mary emerged from the series under the influence of Superman villain Darkseid.

This darker Mary Marvel appears in DC&#x27;s 2008 crossover series &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by J. G. Jones, as a Female Fury, with another design change (to match the styles of the other Furies) and a fully evil personality due to possession by DeSaad. Though defeated by Freddy Freeman/Shazam before the end of the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; miniseries, the evil Mary appeared again in the &quot;Black Adam and Isis&quot; arc featured in &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; (vol. 3) #23–25, by the end of which she has lost her powers and returned to being a normal teenage girl.

====2010s====
In 2011, following its &quot;Flashpoint&quot; company-wide event, DC made sweeping continuity changes to some comic book series and minor ones to others, as part of its relaunch event &quot;The New 52&quot;. Captain Marvel, now known as Shazam, received a new origin story as part of a &quot;Shazam!&quot; backup feature by writer Geoff Johns and penciler Gary Frank, published between 2012 and 2013 in the relaunched &quot;Justice League&quot; comic series. Mary does not feature in the new continuity until &quot;Justice League&quot; #8 (2012), and is not transformed into a superhero for the first time until &quot;Justice League&quot; #21 (2013), when Billy directs his powers into her, Freddy, and their foster siblings Darla, Pedro, and Eugene during a fray with Black Adam.

Mary was largely absent from the main DC Universe for several years after &quot;Justice League&quot; #22 in 2013. Versions of Mary Marvel from alternate earths in the DC Multiverse appeared in events such as &quot;The Multiversity&quot; in 2014 and &quot;Convergence&quot; in 2015. In December 2018, Geoff John and artist Dale Eaglesham launched a new &quot;Shazam!&quot; ongoing comic series, featuring Mary alongside Billy Batson and the rest of the Shazam Family. The first issue of the new volume of &quot;Shazam!&quot; also featured a manga backup focused on Mary by Geoff Johns and Mayo &quot;SEN&quot; Naito.

==Fictional character biography==
===Original Fawcett origin===
Mary Marvel&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Captain Marvel Adventures&quot; #18 also relayed her origin story.

As infants, twins Billy and Mary Batson were nursed by a woman named Sarah Primm. When the Batsons&#x27; parents die in a car accident, Primm was required to send both children to an orphanage. However, Primm is determined to at least give one of the children a home, and arranges for Mary to secretly take the place of another baby girl who had suddenly died while under Primm&#x27;s care. As a result, Billy is sent to an orphanage while his sister is raised by the wealthy Mrs. Bromfield.

Several years later, Billy Batson becomes a teenage radio announcer. While hosting an on-air quizbowl, he receives an urgent letter from Sarah Primm, now on her death bed, requesting his presence. Billy goes to see her during a break, and Primm tells him the secret of his long-lost sister. To help him find Mary, Primm gives Billy a locket broken in half and tells the boy with her last breaths that Mary wears the other half.

After the quizbowl broadcast is over, Billy tells his best friend Freddy Freeman about his sister and the locket. Billy then recalls that one of the quizbowl contestants, a rich girl named Mary Bromfield, wore a broken locket. He and Freddy trail Mary&#x27;s limousine in their superpowered forms of Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr. and find themselves called into service to save Mary from a gang of kidnappers.

Captain Marvel then learns that Mary&#x27;s locket matches his own, and that she is indeed Billy&#x27;s sister. The Marvels reveal their secret identities to Mary, who wonders if, since she is Billy&#x27;s twin, she could become a Marvel by saying the magic word &quot;Shazam&quot;. Billy, however, is assured that &quot;Old Shaz—er—you know who—wouldn&#x27;t give his powers to a girl!&quot;

Just then, the kidnappers awaken then bind and gag Billy and Freddy, preventing them from saying their magic words. Mary exclaims that Billy cannot say &quot;Shazam&quot;, inadvertently saying the word herself. She is then struck by a magic lightning bolt and transformed into a super-powered version of herself, later christened &quot;Mary Marvel&quot; by her brother. She defeats the thugs by herself, discovering that she is bulletproof and has super strength, and frees Billy and Freddy. Shazam later reveals the goddesses Mary derives her powers from.

===Modified DC origin===

Mary Marvel&#x27;s updated DC origin was presented in the &quot;Power of Shazam!&quot; graphic novel and ongoing series, written by Jerry Ordway.

Prominent archaeologists C.C. and Marilyn Batson are assigned by the Sivana expedition on an excursion to Egypt. They take along their young daughter Mary, but are forced to leave their son Billy in America with C.C.&#x27;s half-brother. The elder Batsons are killed by their associate Theo Adam, who then kidnaps Mary. Upon Theo Adam&#x27;s return to the United States, Adam&#x27;s sister, a maid named Sarah Primm, takes Mary into her care. Primm arranges for her childless employers, Nick and Nora Bromfield, to illegally adopt Mary. As Mary Bromfield, the young girl grows up living an idyllic life in a wealthy family, but continuously has dreams of another family with a brother she has never seen.

Meanwhile, Billy eventually finding himself on the streets, and is given the power to become Captain Marvel. He learns that Mary is still alive, but after four years of searching, neither he nor his benefactor, the wizard Shazam, can find the girl. The only thing Billy has to remember Mary by is her favorite toy, a &quot;Tawky Tawny&quot; doll, which was shipped to America with the Batsons’ possessions after their murders.

As a young teenager, Mary enters a regional spelling bee held in Fawcett City and emceed by Billy, who works as an on-air reporter for WHIZ radio. After saving Mary from kidnappers twice as Captain Marvel, Billy notices how much Mary Bromfield reminds him of Mary Batson and has an undercover cop named &quot;Muscles&quot; McGinnis retrieve the girl&#x27;s forged adoption record. Learning that Mary is indeed his sister, Billy tries to figure out a way to let Mary know he is her brother. The old &quot;Tawky Tawny&quot; doll suddenly transforms into a full-sized humanoid tiger and comes to life, instructing Billy to take it to Mary. As Captain Marvel, Billy flies out to the Bromfields’ hometown of Fairfield to deliver the doll and the adoption papers to Mary.

Captain Marvel arrives at the Bromfield estate and changes back to Billy Batson to deliver the package, but is immediately kidnapped by the thugs who helped Primm forge Mary&#x27;s adoption records. Mary, not having seen Billy, takes the package and opens it, discovering the adoption records and the Tawky Tawny doll. Once again, the doll comes to life and instructs the bewildered girl to say the magic word &quot;Shazam&quot; and save her brother. Mary complies and is transformed by a bolt of magic lightning into a superpowered doppelganger of her deceased mother. She saves Billy, who transforms into Captain Marvel to help Mary defeat the thugs, but the two Marvels cannot save Sarah Primm, who is murdered by one of the thugs.

===&quot;The Trials of Shazam!&quot; and &quot;Countdown&quot;===

In the eleven page preview to Judd Winick and Howard Porter&#x27;s &quot;Trials of Shazam&quot; limited series appearing in DC&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; one-shot comic (June 2006), Mary Marvel loses her powers in mid-flight as an after-effect of the death of the wizard Shazam by the Spectre in &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; #6, and falls from a height of three miles. Mary survives the fall but goes into a coma, and Freddy Freeman, who lost the power to become Captain Marvel Jr. in the same way, has her transported to a hospital in New York City where he can keep watch over her. He spends all his money to help her.

In &quot;Countdown&quot; #51, Mary is released from the hospital. She finds that she is still powerless and a note left by Freddy Freeman with a nurse asks her not to look for him as he is trying to get the powers of Shazam back, per the orders of Marvel. Making her way to Gotham City (despite being warned by Madame Xanadu to avoid the place in &quot;Countdown&quot; #50), Mary stumbles upon the former Kahndaqi embassy while being chased by violent criminals from the subway, who are killed by Black Adam. Black Adam angrily threatens her. Mary tells Adam how much she valued her powers and how she desires to regain them. Adam, bitter over the loss of his wife Isis and brother-in-law Osiris during the events of &quot;52&quot; as well as his failure to resurrect the former, gives Mary his powers instead of killing her. He is transformed into the mortal Teth-Adam, whom Mary rescues from a wall toppling on him. Mary wears a black form-fitting costume and wields Adam&#x27;s powers as a darker, angrier character. While searching for a tutor to help her harness her power at the reformed Riddler&#x27;s advice, she encounters Klarion the Witch boy in a market for dark magic, who tries to take her power, then Zatanna, who banishes her from her home after a fight, and then Eclipso, who only fuels her wild abandon. She uses a rougher justice, such as turning soldiers to stone and shrinking poachers so their quarries chase them.

Their alliance, however, seems to break down when Eclipso, hoping to please her master Darkseid, offers Mary as his new concubine, reasoning that the two women could always leech Darkseid&#x27;s arcane knowledge, slay him, and take his place. Mary refuses to sell herself for more power, beats Eclipso with her own crystal, and flees, enraged. Eclipso catches up to her and regains the diamond. Eclipso then departs, leaving Mary alone again. Some time later, Eclipso returns hoping to finish her off, but Mary is too strong for her.

Mary experiences a change of mind, and upon realizing that Black Adam&#x27;s powers are as responsible for her corruption as Eclipso, divests herself of them by feeding the lightning bolt into Eclipso, who tries to kill her and take her power. Both women lose their powers and fall into the ocean. However, an unpowered Mary lands on Themysciran soil, where Queen Hippolyta drafts her in the rebellion against Granny Goodness, who is posing as the goddess Athena.

Mary, Holly Robinson, and Harleen Quinzel manage to reveal Goodness&#x27; deception, and the trio follow her to Apokolips. After escaping the Female Furies, Mary starts to hear the voices of the gods. The group manages to free the Olympian gods from an Apokoliptan chamber, and Mary Marvel&#x27;s powers are restored along with her white costume, which now has a gray lightning bolt and long sleeves.

After journeying with the Challengers to Earth-51 and witnessing the Great Disaster occurring there, Mary finally returns home to find Darkseid waiting for her. Reminding her of how strong she felt using Black Adam&#x27;s powers, and claiming the gods do not trust her as much now, he returns them to her, restoring her black costume. She then confronts Donna Troy, Kyle Rayner, Forager, and Jimmy Olsen, seizing Jimmy to take him back to Darkseid. When Donna questions Mary&#x27;s use of the powers, Mary insists that she is not evil, merely &quot;driven&quot;. After Darkseid&#x27;s defeat, Mary returns to Black Adam, asking to be a part of a new Black Marvel Family. Adam refuses her and, after a big tantrum, she decides to become a solo superheroine.

===&quot;Final Crisis&quot;===
Mary returns in &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, still apparently in Darkseid&#x27;s thrall, wearing a new black costume with more of a punk look. She attacks Wonder Woman, scratching the Amazon&#x27;s upper arm and infecting her with an unknown virus delivered from a broken glass vial bearing a gold Omega symbol. Later, when the heroes of Earth attack Blüdhaven, Black Adam notes that she&#x27;s been possessed by one of the New Gods, a &quot;leering old man&quot;. The possessed Mary claims to have a new dirty magic word, a blasphemous name of power, and to have new gods. During a heated battle with Supergirl, Black Adam learns that the evil god DeSaad possessed Mary. Black Adam tries to kill her but is stopped by Freddy. Later, distracted by hordes of Anti-Life followers about to attack, Freddy Freeman, the new Captain Marvel, grabs Mary and uses the last of his magic to transform them back to normal. Though horrified by her actions while possessed by DeSaad, and saying, while crying, that she never meant for this to happen, she is seen standing with Freddy with clubs in their hands, awaiting the end of the world.

===&quot;Justice Society of America&quot;===
After the end of the Crisis, Mary is recruited by Black Adam and Isis, who have taken over the Rock of Eternity from its former caretaker the wizard Shazam by defeating Captain Marvel and stealing his powers, using the magic scarab Shazam used to take Black Adam&#x27;s powers. During a battle between Black Adam, Isis, and the Justice Society, who had been summoned by Billy, the evil Mary Marvel abducts a powerless Billy Batson and forces him to become a teenage Black Marvel by sharing her powers and forcing him to say &quot;Mary Marvel&quot;.

The two now evil Black Marvels join Adam and Isis, who are intent on using the power of Shazam to destroy the modern world, in fighting the Justice Society. When Isis begins attacking the citizens of Adam&#x27;s native Khandaq and Adam&#x27;s friend Atom Smasher, he switches loyalties and joins the Justice Society&#x27;s Flash and the spirit of Mary and Billy&#x27;s father in helping resurrect the wizard Shazam from the Rock of Finality, where he has been sealed in stone. Black Adam gives up his powers to restore the wizard to life. Shazam promptly and angrily takes his powers back from Mary, Billy, and Isis, turns Teth Adam and Isis to stone, and closes off all contact to the Rock of Eternity to the Batson kids upon stating that Billy and Mary failed him. He also threatens to go after Freddy for stealing his name. The two Batsons are later seen wandering the streets of Fawcett City, homeless, and wondering what happened to their father&#x27;s spirit.

Mary and Billy are briefly seen during the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, now living in an apartment in Fawcett City. While watching news reports of the various heroes and villains being reanimated as Black Lanterns on their laptop, Mary remarks how scary it is to not have her powers anymore.

Mary is approached by Blaze, who offers to restore her and Billy&#x27;s powers in exchange for her killing Freddy. Mary seems to go along with the deal, appearing to poison Freddy. However, when Blaze arrives to claim Freddy&#x27;s powers, he gets up and attacks her. With a little help from Mary and Billy, Freddy defeats Blaze and sends her back to hell, later promising them that he will find a way to restore their lost powers.

===The New 52/DC Rebirth===
The DC Universe was rebooted in 2011 with the New 52 line of comics. In the current continuity, Mary appears as Mary Bromfield, making her debut in &quot;Justice League&quot; (vol. 2) #8 in 2012. She is the oldest kid living in the Vázquezes&#x27; foster home, along with Billy Batson, Freddy Freeman, Eugene Choi, Darla Dudley, and Pedro Peña. Whether or not this Mary is still Billy&#x27;s long-lost sister is not yet known.

Mary was the second child placed with the Vázquezes, having run away from an abusive home at a young age. Polite and well-mannered, Mary functions as the unofficial &quot;den mother&quot;, looking after her foster siblings. When Billy arrives at the Vázquez home and gains the power to become Shazam, he shares his powers with his foster siblings. By saying the magic word &quot;Shazam!&quot; Mary can become an adult superhero with a red uniform similar to that of the traditional Mary Marvel.

==Powers and abilities==

=== Magical abilities ===
Similar to the Captain Marvel/Shazam, Mary can transform between her ordinary and demigod-like from by saying the magic word (&quot;Shazam!&quot;), granting her various superpowers derived from six divine entities. Throughout the character&#x27;s publication, her abilities ranged from being granted by another chosen champion to being elevated into a chose champion herself, the latter allows her to potentially share with others at will. Within the DC Universe, she is rated at an &quot;Alpha&quot; level, making her comparable to Superman, Wonder Woman, and a Green Lantern.

==== Powers of Shazam (Wizard Shazam) ====
As Black Mary, her magical abilities and affinity are greater and she manipulates a variant of magic known as the &quot;Living Magic&quot;. Mary possesses such a mastery of this power that she is acknowledged as a &quot;sorceress&quot; by Darkseid. Her command over the arcane arts encompasses a wide range of abilities, including transmutation, manipulation of time, heightened mystic senses, and the conjuring of lightning. Through her proficiency in the Power of Aten, Mary has successfully engaged formidable opponents such as Zatanna and Enchantress, emerging victorious against the latter.

In the New 52 onward and while under the Wizard Shazam&#x27;s, the character possess a portion of the Living Lightning derived from her empowerment by Shazam (and later acting as the main Champion), which also facilitates her powers. Thus, she retains additional magical abilities including lightning control, amplification of spells, further enhancement of strength, and enhances healing capabilities, among others. 
==== Powers of Shazam (Hippolyta version) ====
During the &quot;Lazarus Planet: Revenge of the Gods&quot; story arc, Mary loses her original Shazam powers, but is bestowed powers originating from goddesses by Hippolyta rather than by the Wizard Shazam. This listing is inspired from the Fawcett&#x27;s version with some changes. While no longer conferring the Wizard Shazam&#x27;s Living Lightning and it&#x27;s magical abilities, Mary still possess some magical abilities derived from the powers of the gods, allowing her skills such as astral projection.

<doc id="713059" wikidata="Q929309" url="?curid=713059" title="Greek words for love">
<text>Ancient Greek philosophy differentiates main conceptual forms and distinct words for the Modern English word love: &quot;agápē&quot;, &quot;érōs&quot;, &quot;philía&quot;, &quot;philautía&quot;, &quot;storgē&quot;, and &quot;xenía&quot;.

==List of concepts==
Though there are more Greek words for love, variants and possibly subcategories, a general summary considering these Ancient Greek concepts is:

* &quot;Agape&quot; () means, when translated literally, affection, as in &quot;greet with affection&quot; and &quot;show affection for the dead&quot;. The verb form of the word &quot;agape&quot; goes as far back as Homer. In a Christian context, agape means &quot;love: esp. unconditional love, charity; the love of God for person and of person for God&quot;. Agape is also used to refer to a love feast. The Christian priest and philosopher Thomas Aquinas described agape as &quot;to will the good of another&quot;.
* &quot;Eros&quot; () means &quot;love, mostly of the sexual passion&quot;. The Modern Greek word &quot;erotas&quot; means &quot;intimate love&quot;. Plato refined his own definition: Although &quot;eros&quot; is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or and may ultimately transcend particulars to become an appreciation of beauty itself, hence the concept of platonic love to mean &quot;without physical attraction&quot;. In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;, Socrates argues that &quot;eros&quot; helps the soul recall its inherent knowledge of ideal beauty and spiritual truth. Thus, the ideal form of youthful beauty arouses erotic desire, but also points toward higher spiritual ideals.
* &quot;Philia&quot; () means &quot;affectionate regard, friendship&quot;, usually &quot;between equals&quot;. It is a dispassionate virtuous love. In Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, &quot;philia&quot; is expressed variously as loyalty to friends (&quot;brotherly love&quot;), family, and community; it requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. 
* &quot;Storge&quot; () means &quot;love, affection&quot; and &quot;especially of parents and children&quot;. It is the common or natural empathy, like that felt by parents for offspring. It is rarely used in ancient works, almost exclusively to describe family relationships. It may also express mere acceptance or tolerance, as in &quot;loving&quot; the tyrant. It may also describe love of country or enthusiasm for a favorite sports team.
* &quot;Philautia&quot; () means &quot;self-love&quot;. To love oneself or &quot;regard for one&#x27;s own happiness or advantage&quot; has been conceptualized both as a basic human necessity and as a moral flaw, akin to vanity and selfishness, synonymous with &quot;amour-propre&quot; or egotism. The Greeks further divided this love into positive and negative: one, the unhealthy version, is the self-obsessed love, and the other is the concept of self-compassion. Aristotle also considers &quot;philautia&quot; to be the root of a general kind of love for family, friends, the enjoyment of an activity, as well as that between lovers.
* &quot;Xenia&quot; () is an ancient Greek concept of hospitality, &quot;guest-friendship&quot;, or &quot;ritualized friendship&quot;. It was a social institution requiring generosity, gift exchange, and reciprocity. Hospitality towards foreigners and traveling Hellenes was understood as a moral obligation under the patronage of Zeus &quot;Xenios&quot; and Athene &quot;Xenia&quot;. Many understand the Odyssey as a story principally concerned with the concept. For instance, the failure of the Suitors of Penelope to appropriately welcome disguised Odysseus into his own home can be seen as justification for their subsequent demise.

<text>Aurōra () is the Latin word for dawn, and the goddess of dawn in Roman mythology and Latin poetry.
Like Greek &quot;Eos&quot; and Rigvedic &quot;Ushas&quot;, &quot;Aurōra&quot; continues the name of an earlier Indo-European dawn goddess, &quot;Hausos&quot;.

== Name ==
Aurōra stems from Proto-Italic &quot;*ausōs&quot;, and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*haéusōs&quot;, the &quot;dawn&quot; conceived as divine entity. It has cognates in the goddesses Ēṓs, Uṣas, Aušrinė, Auseklis and Ēastre.

==Roman mythology==
In Roman mythology, Aurōra renews herself every morning and flies across the sky, announcing the arrival of the Sun. Her parentage was flexible: for Ovid, she could equally be &quot;Pallantis&quot;, signifying the daughter of Pallas, or the daughter of Hyperion. She has two siblings, a brother (Sol, the Sun) and a sister (Luna, the Moon). Roman writers rarely imitated Hesiod and later Greek poets by naming Aurōra as the mother of the Anemoi (the Winds), who were the offspring of Astraeus, the father of the stars.

Aurōra appears most often in sexual poetry with one of her mortal lovers. A myth taken from the Greek by Roman poets tells that one of her lovers was the prince of Troy, Tithonus. Tithonus was a mortal, and would therefore age and die. Wanting to be with her lover for all eternity, Aurōra asked Jupiter to grant immortality to Tithonus. Jupiter granted her wish, but she failed to ask for eternal youth to accompany his immortality, and he continued to age, eventually becoming forever old. Aurōra turned him into a cicada.

==Mention in literature and music==

From Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;:


Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot; (16.201-202), Paris names his well-known family members, among which Aurōra&#x27;s lover as follows:
Virgil mentions in the fourth book of his &quot;Aeneid&quot;:
Rutilius Claudius Namatianus mentions in his 5th century poem &quot;De reditu suo&quot;:
Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (I.i), Montague says of his lovesick son Romeo:
In traditional Irish folk songs, such as &quot;Lord Courtown&quot;:
In the poem &quot;Let me not mar that perfect Dream&quot; by Emily Dickinson:
In &quot;On Imagination&quot; by Phillis Wheatley:
In the poem &quot;Tithonus&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Aurōra is described thus:
In singer-songwriter Björk&#x27;s &quot;Vespertine&quot; track, Aurōra is described as
In Chapter 8 of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Villette&quot;, Madame Beck fires her old Governess first thing in the morning and is described by the narrator, Lucy Snowe: &quot;All this, I say, was done between the moment of Madame Beck&#x27;s issuing like Aurōra from her chamber, and that in which she coolly sat down to pour out her first cup of coffee.&quot;

The 20th-century Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert wrote about Aurōra&#x27;s grandchildren. In his poem they are ugly, even though they will grow to be beautiful (&quot;Kwestia Smaku&quot;).

The first and strongest of the 50 Spacer worlds in &quot;The Caves of Steel&quot; and subsequent novels by Isaac Asimov is named after the goddess Aurora. Its capital city is Eos.

<text>Hyperion Entertainment CVBA (formerly Hyperion Entertainment VOF) is a Belgian software company which in its early years focused in porting Windows games to Amiga OS, Linux, and Mac OS. In 2001, they accepted a contract by Amiga Incorporated to develop AmigaOS 4 and mainly discontinued their porting business to pursue this development. AmigaOS 4 runs on the AmigaOne systems, Commodore Amiga systems with a Phase5 PowerUP accelerator board, Pegasos II systems and Sam440/Sam460 systems.

== History ==
Hyperion Entertainment was founded in April 1999 by Ben Hermans and Evert Carton to port PC games to the Amiga. Hans-Joerg Frieden, who had previously worked on the Warp3D library and ports of the games &quot;Descent&quot; and &quot;Abuse&quot;, was contracted to be Hyperion&#x27;s main developer. The company&#x27;s first project was an Amiga port of Heretic II, released in 2000 to commercial failure. As a result, Hyperion expanded its scope to also include ports for Linux and Mac OS. Later that year, Hyperion ported SiN for Linux, postponing and ultimately cancelling a port of the game to the Amiga due to hardware requirements. An improved version of Heretic II was released for AmigaOS 4 in early 2024.

They also approached Monolith Productions to port their Lithtech engine, culminating in their port of &quot;&quot; for Amiga, Linux, and Mac OS in 2001. The game had not sold as well as had been hoped, most notably on Linux, despite becoming a best seller on Tux Games. Hyperion stated that Linux users were likely to dual boot with Windows to play easily available games rather than purchase more expensive specialised versions years after release. In early 2002, Hyperion introduced the Amiga port of &quot;&quot;. An improved version for AmigaOS 4 followed in 2010. After id Software released its source code, Hyperion marketed later in 2002 a commercial Amiga port of &quot;Quake II&quot;. A Linux port of &quot;Gorky 17&quot; was developed by Hyperion and published by Linux Game Publishing in 2006, while a version for AmigaOS 4 was released nearly a decade later in 2015.

During work on the Heretic II port, Hyperion Entertainment developers created an OpenGL subset called MiniGL, which sits on top of Warp3D to ease the porting of 3D games. The MiniGL library was released for free to other software developers.

=== AmigaOS 4 ===
In 2001, Hyperion announced that, after licensing the rights from Amiga, Inc., it would be working on the successor to AmigaOS 3.9 and concentrating its efforts on the development of AmigaOS 4. Hyperion still claimed that it is based upon AmigaOS 3.1 source code and, to a lesser extent certain, AmigaOS 3.9 sources. A quick port of 68k AmigaOS to PowerPC was originally planned, with new features added as development continued. Ben Hermans, writing on Amiga forum Ann.lu, claimed that these sources, along with the source of the PPC kernel WarpOS would be sufficient to provide a version to users within a year, making his now-infamous &quot;change some flags and recompile&quot; comment.

AmigaOS 4.0 was first released to end-users and second-level beta testers in April 2004, with AmigaOS 4.1 following in September 2008. It is currently still in development.

In 2004, Hyperion attempted to obtain a licence for an AmigaOS 4 native port of the file manager Directory Opus, which had originally and been developed on the Amiga but for which development had since moved to the Microsoft Windows platform. Talks between Hyperion and GP Software broke down.

The first managing partner of Hyperion, Benjamin Hermans, in the period between the announcement and release of AmigaOS 4, ignited a community controversy by repeatedly claiming that MorphOS, an AmigaOS-like competitor (which had been released in complete form in 2003), was illegal and had on several occasions threatened to take legal action against it either on the grounds that it was parasitic competition to AmigaOS 4, or even that it was actually based on stolen AmigaOS source code. No evidence to support either claim ever became public, nor did any legal action against MorphOS take place; neither prevented such views being repeated in public Amiga forums and mailing lists. This situation was inflamed by ex-Commodore engineer Dave Haynie, who backed up Herman&#x27;s claims: &quot;If you have seen the Amiga source code, you cannot produce a legally separate work-alike&quot;, though again without any direct evidence.

Hermans claimed that Bill Buck, who led the Genesi company funding MorphOS, was a &quot;con-artist&quot;.

Evert Carton took over the managing partner position after Hermans stepped down in 2003, due to a lack of time for daily administrative work. Timothy de Groote became another partner in 2003.

=== Dispute and settlement with Amiga, Inc. ===
In 2007, Hyperion was sued by Amiga Incorporated for trademark infringement in the Washington Western District Court in Seattle, Washington. Amiga, Inc. sued Hyperion for breach of contract, trademark violation and copyright infringement concerning the development and marketing of AmigaOS 4, stating that Hyperion had continued to develop and market AmigaOS 4 without paying agreed royalties and had continued to do so even after being warned to cease and desist.

Hyperion launched a counteraction, claiming fraud in Amiga, Inc. handling of Amiga intellectual properties and debts, including the use of debt-holding shell companies, by shifting responsibility between these shell companies. They also claimed that Amiga, Inc. had failed to uphold their part of the contract and had been untruthful in correspondence and that they had failed to deliver the AmigaOS 3.1 source that AmigaOS 4 was developed from, forcing Hyperion to find it elsewhere. In autumn 2007, Hyperion released a standalone version of AmigaOS 4 for classic Amiga, an action Amiga, Inc. claimed was illegal.

On 29 May 2007, the new managing partner stated under oath – without further evidence – that the open-source AmigaOS reimplementation of AROS was &quot;probably illegal&quot;, as documented on page 27 of court documents related to the Amiga-Hyperion court case.

Hyperion and Amiga, Inc. reached a settlement on 30 September 2009. Hyperion was granted an exclusive license to develop and market AmigaOS 4 and subsequent versions under the name AmigaOS. However, the &quot;Amiga&quot; trademark remained with Amiga, Inc. and was then also licensed to other parties, including Commodore USA and iContain. This meant that &quot;Amiga&quot;-branded hardware could and would be sold without AmigaOS 4.

In 2009, Hyperion changed its legal status from a business partnership (VOF) to a company with limited liability (CVBA).

On 24 April 2011, Evert Carton announced he was stepping down as the managing partner of Hyperion. In charge of the company were then Ben Hermans and Timothy de Groote.

===Insolvency Declaration of 2015===
On 27 January 2015, Hyperion Entertainment was declared insolvent. Ben Hermans has claimed that this was an administrative mistake by a third party and that the company would appeal the insolvency decision. The declaration was overturned on 2 April 2015 and the company posted a clarification on its website.

=== Recent events ===
AmigaOS 4 developer and Aminet administrator Costel Mincea joined Hyperion in mid-2015 as a third director. Hyperion reported in January 2017 that Hermans has resigned as a director, in charge of the company remained Timothy De Groote and Costel Mincea. In October 2017, Hyperion was removed from Belgium&#x27;s official company register due to not filling out annual reports for the last three years. Hyperion supplied the reports to the National Bank of Belgium. In July 2020, amiga-news.de reported that Costel Mincea resigned from his post at Hyperion and that remaining director Timothy de Groote was in a legal dispute with former Hyperion&#x27;s managing partner Ben Hermans. In February 2021, Timothy de Groote was no longer director of Hyperion and Ben Hermans assumed full control of the company. After bancruptcy of Ben Hermans BV which was the largest shareholder of Hyperion Entertainment, Timothy De Groote returned as a director in December 2024.

== Game ports ==
Hyperion&#x27;s game ports include &quot;Heretic II&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gorky 17&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot;, &quot;SiN&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Hyperion also announced that it acquired the license to port &quot;Worms Armageddon&quot; and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, but these were not released.

<doc id="713080" wikidata="Q232187" url="?curid=713080" title="Alex Kingston">
<text>Alexandra Elizabeth Kingston (born 11 March 1963) is an English actress. Active from the early 1980s, Kingston became noted for her television work in both Britain and the US in the 1990s, including her regular role as Dr. Elizabeth Corday in the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot; (1997–2004) and her title role in the ITV miniseries &quot;The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders&quot; (1996), which earned her a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.

Kingston&#x27;s later credits include the recurring role of River Song in the BBC science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2008–2015), Mrs. Bennet in the ITV period-drama fantasy &quot;Lost in Austen&quot; (2008), Dinah Lance in The CW&#x27;s superhero fiction drama series &quot;Arrow&quot; (2013–2016), and Sarah Bishop in &quot;A Discovery of Witches&quot; (2018–2022).

==Early life==
Kingston was born and brought up in Epsom, Surrey, to Anthony Kingston, an English butcher and his German wife, Margarethe (née Renneisen). Kingston&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandmother was Jewish, an ancestry Kingston explored on the series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; Kingston&#x27;s uncle, her mother&#x27;s younger brother, is actor Walter Renneisen. Her younger sisters are Susie, who is mentally and physically disabled as a result of being deprived of oxygen at birth, and Nicola, a former actress who appeared in the 1996 British TV production of &quot;The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders&quot;, in which Kingston starred.

Kingston was inspired to pursue acting by one of her teachers at Rosebery School for Girls. Kingston auditioned and performed in the Surrey County Youth Theatre production of &quot;Tom Jones&quot; as Mrs. Fitzpatrick, alongside Sean Pertwee as Captain Fitzpatrick, and Thwackum played by Tom Davison. She later completed a three-year programme at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and went on to join the Royal Shakespeare Company.

==Career==

=== 1980–2007: Early career and breakthrough with &quot;ER&quot; ===
In 1980, Kingston made her television debut in three episodes of the children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, while also appearing as an uncredited extra in the film &quot;The Wildcats of St Trinian&#x27;s&quot;. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, she performed on stage in twenty different theatrical productions, working extensively with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. Her classic Shakespearean roles included Calpurnia in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1987), Cordelia in &quot;King Lear&quot; (1990), Hero in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1990–1991), Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1992) and Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot; (1993).

Around the same time, she could be seen playing small parts in television shows like &quot;A Killing on the Exchange&quot; (1987), &quot;Hannay&quot; (1989), &quot;Covington Cross&quot; (1992), &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot; (1993) and &quot;Crocodile Shoes&quot; (1994), and also had various guest roles in ITV&#x27;s long-running police procedural &quot;The Bill&quot; (1988–1995). In film, she appeared in &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover&quot; (1989) with Helen Mirren, &quot;The Infiltrator&quot; (1995) with Oliver Platt and &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995) with Emma Thompson, where she played writer Frances Partridge.

In April 1996, she got her first regular television role as customs officer Katherine Roberts in the ITV crime drama &quot;The Knock&quot;, appearing in all thirteen episodes of the second series. In December, she played the lead role opposite Daniel Craig in &quot;The Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders&quot;, an ITV adaptation of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. She received a nomination for Best Actress for her performance at the following year&#x27;s British Academy Television Awards.In September 1997, Kingston gained North American television fame after being cast as a main character in the long-running medical drama &quot;ER&quot;. She made her first appearance as British surgeon Elizabeth Corday in the premiere of the fourth season, the Emmy Award-winning live episode &quot;Ambush&quot;. Having appeared in the show for just over seven seasons, she left it in October 2004, in the eleventh-season episode &quot;Fear&quot;, after her contract was not renewed. Being 41 at the time, she criticised the move as ageism, stating that &quot;apparently, I, according to the producers and the writers, am part of the old fogies who are no longer interesting.&quot; Despite that, she said that she was &quot;very proud of the work [she had] done over the past eight years&quot; and &quot;grateful for the professional associations and friendships [she had] made through &quot;ER&quot;&quot;.

The &quot;ER&quot; role helped propel Kingston&#x27;s career to new heights, which led to a number of big-screen appearances in films like the Clive Owen neo-noir drama &quot;Croupier&quot; (1998) and independent period drama &quot;Sweet Land&quot; (2005), as well as the crime dramas &quot;Essex Boys&quot; (2000) and &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; (2006). In 2003, she battled Romans as the warrior queen of Britain in ITV&#x27;s biopic &quot;Boudica&quot;, which was also released in the USA on PBS under the title &quot;Warrior Queen&quot; and marked the screen debut of Emily Blunt.

In November 2005, Kingston guest starred as a vacationer whose husband gets kidnapped by a Mexican street gang in an episode of the CBS crime drama &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, titled &quot;Viuda Negra&quot; and directed by her former &quot;ER&quot; co-star Paul McCrane. The following year, she returned to the stage after ten years in the West End production of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, starring as Nurse Ratched opposite Christian Slater as Randle McMurphy. She then revealed that she auditioned for the role of Lynette Scavo on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; but was turned away for being too curvy.

=== 2008–2015: &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and further television and stage work ===
In 2008, Kingston guest starred as Professor River Song in the fourth series of the BBC&#x27;s long-running science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in the two-part story &quot;Silence in the Library&quot; / &quot;Forest of the Dead&quot;, starring David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. She thought it was simply a one-off guest role but was delighted to find out that she would be a returning character after the story&#x27;s writer, Steven Moffat, succeeded Russell T Davies as the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; showrunner. She reprised the role in thirteen episodes between 2010 and 2015, appearing on screen opposite two more incarnations of the Doctor played by Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi. Kingston has also portrayed the role in a number of audio dramas from Big Finish Productions, including her solo series &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot; (2015–2023).

In September 2008, Kingston took the part of Mrs. Bennet in ITV&#x27;s acclaimed four-part drama &quot;Lost in Austen&quot;, based on Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. In October, she appeared in the episode &quot;&quot; of the police procedural drama &quot;&quot; as psychiatrist and grief counsellor Patricia Alwick, who helped the team cope with the recent death of one of their members.

In both 2009 and 2010, Kingston had recurring roles as MI6 agent Fiona Banks in the ABC science fiction drama &quot;FlashForward&quot; and defence attorney Miranda Pond in the NBC legal drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, in which she reunited with her former &quot;ER&quot; castmates, Mariska Hargitay and Maria Bello. In spring 2009, Kingston returned to &quot;ER&quot; itself during its fifteenth and final season for two episodes, &quot;Dream Runner&quot; and the two-hour series finale, &quot;And in the End...&quot;. In June, she starred as the lead character Ellie Lagden, one of four former convicts, in the BBC One eight-part drama series &quot;Hope Springs&quot;.

In the early 2010s, Kingston played a housewife in the five-part supernatural drama &quot;Marchlands&quot; (2011), an archaeologist in the second series of the revived &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot; (2012) and an analyst working for a missing persons unit in the four-part crime drama &quot;Chasing Shadows&quot; (2014).&quot;&quot; In the US, she appeared in the romantic film &quot;Like Crazy&quot; (2011) and the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; spin-off series &quot;Private Practice&quot; (2011), in the guest role of a psychiatrist writing book reviews. She also starred in the first season of The CW&#x27;s superhero drama series &quot;Arrow&quot; (2013) as Professor Dinah Lance, the mother of Laurel and Sara Lance, and later reprised the role in a few episodes over the next three seasons. On stage, she participated in the Donmar Warehouse production of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s play &quot;Luise Miller&quot; (2011), directed by Michael Grandage.

In July 2013, she played Lady Macbeth opposite Kenneth Branagh in the Manchester International Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which was broadcast live in cinemas worldwide as part of the National Theatre Live programme. Following a nomination for Best Actress at the Manchester Theatre Awards, she reprised her role with Branagh at the Park Avenue Armory in June 2014, making her New York stage debut. Earlier in April, Branagh and Kingston took other classic Shakespearean lead roles in the two-and-a-half-hour adaptation of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio 3 as part of its celebration of the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare&#x27;s birth.

=== 2016–present: Recent work ===

During the late 2010s, she took a prominent role as Sarah Bishop in Sky&#x27;s fantasy drama &quot;A Discovery of Witches&quot; (2018–2022), while also appearing in shows like &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot; (2016), &quot;Shoot the Messenger&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Widow&quot; (2019). In 2021, she wrote a River Song novel called &quot;Doctor Who: The Ruby&#x27;s Curse&quot; for BBC Books, and reprised the role for pre-recorded elements of the interactive theatrical experience &quot;Time Fracture&quot;. The following year, she starred as British Prime Minister candidate Audrey Gratz in the Netflix spy miniseries &quot;Treason&quot; and as the villainous Lucifer in the &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;-inspired children&#x27;s television series &quot;Dodger&quot;, also starring the Ninth Doctor actor, Christopher Eccleston.

In January 2023, she returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company for the first time since the early nineties in the role of Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kingston met English actor Ralph Fiennes while they were both students at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. They were together for ten years before marrying in 1993. In 1995, Fiennes began an affair with his &quot;Hamlet&quot; co-star Francesca Annis and left Kingston the following year; they were divorced in 1997. In a 2006 interview, she admitted to considering and nearly attempting suicide after her separation from Fiennes.

At the end of 1998, Kingston married Florian Haertel, a German writer and freelance journalist, having met him the previous year on a blind date arranged by friends; they had a daughter, Salome Violetta Haertel, born 28 March 2001. Kingston and Haertel separated in 2009. On 30 October 2009, Haertel sued Kingston for dissolution of the marriage, and the divorce was finalised in 2013.

Kingston appeared on the BBC genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in September 2012, investigating the lives of her great-grandfather Will Keevil and her four-times great-grandmother, Elizabeth Braham.

In 2015, Kingston married Jonathan Stamp, a television producer, in an Italian ceremony.

Kingston has lived in the United States, and moved back to the UK in 2019.

<text>Thomas Ustick Walter (September 4, 1804 – October 30, 1887) was an American architect. He worked on more than 400 projects, including Moyamensing Prison and Girard College in Philadelphia. He served as the fourth Architect of the Capitol, and led the addition of the north and south wings and the central dome. He retired in 1865, but financial difficulties forced him back to work in the 1870s, including a job as Chief Assistant to the Architect of Philadelphia City Hall. 

A founder of the American Institute of Architects, he served as its president from 1876 to 1887.

==Early life and education==
Walter was born on September 4, 1804, in Philadelphia. He was the son of mason and bricklayer Joseph S. Walter and his wife Deborah. Walter showed an aptitude for mathematics and drawing at an early age. He worked as a bricklayer for his father during the construction of the Second Bank of the United States and studied architecture in the office of William Strickland.

He attended the School of Mechanic Arts at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and studied under John Haviland. 

Later in life, he received an honorary Masters of Arts degree from Madison University in 1849, a Ph.D. from the University of Lewisburg in 1853, and a Doctor of Laws degree from Harvard University in 1857.

==Career==
Walter established his architectural design practice in 1830. The following year, he was appointed chief architect of the planned Moyamensing Prison. In 1833, the Philadelphia City Council accepted his design for Girard College; he led construction until its completion in 1847.

In 1829, Walter was elected to the Franklin Institute; he would serve the museum in several roles, including as professor of architecture in 1841 and as chairman of the Board of Managers in 1846. 

In 1836, he recommended the creation of the American Institution of Architects and served as secretary. That organization failed, but in 1857, he would help to found the American Institute of Architects, for which he served as vice-president in 1857 and as president from 1876 to 1887.

In 1838, the building committee of Girard College funded a European trip for Walter. He visited England, Ireland, France, and Italy to study the architecture and construction of schools and other buildings and gather ideas for his work at the college.

In 1839, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1841, a local economic downturn created financial hardship for Walter. He was forced to sell his house and most of his architectural library. In 1843, he was commissioned to build a breakwater for the port of LaGuaira, Venezuela, and completed the work in 1845.

===The U.S. Capitol and its dome===
In 1851, Walter was selected by President Millard Fillmore to lead the expansion of the U.S. Capitol. The office of the Architect of the Capitol, originally part of the Department of the Interior, was from 1853 to 1862 placed under the War Department. Walter&#x27;s work was supervised by Montgomery C. Meigs and William B. Franklin. Work was discontinued at the outbreak of the American Civil War, and when it started up again in 1862, his department was again supervised by the Department of the Interior.

Construction on the wings began in 1851. The House of Representatives met in its new quarters in December 1857 and the Senate occupied its new chamber by January 1859. Walter&#x27;s fireproof cast-iron dome was authorized by Congress on March 3, 1855, and was nearly completed by December 2, 1863, when the Statue of Freedom was placed on top. The dome&#x27;s cast-iron frame was made by the iron foundry Janes, Fowler, Kirtland &amp; Co. The 36 Corinthian columns designed by Walter, as well as 144 cast-iron structural pillars for the dome, were supplied by the Baltimore ironworks of Poole &amp; Hunt. Walter also rebuilt the interior of the Library of Congress&#x27; west center building after the fire of 1851. Walter continued as Capitol architect until 1865, when he resigned his position over a minor contract dispute. After 14 years in Washington, he retired to Philadelphia.

In the 1870s, financial setbacks forced Walter from retirement. He worked for a year as a draftsman for the Pennsylvania Railroad. He worked as Chief Assistant to his friend and younger colleague John McArthur Jr., when he won the design competition for Philadelphia City Hall. He continued on that vast project until his death in 1887. He was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==

He married Mary Ann Elizabeth Hancocks in 1824. She died during childbirth in 1847. He was remarried to Amanda Gardiner in 1848. He had 13 children, seven of whom outlived him. His grandson, Thomas Ustick Walter III, was an architect who practiced in Birmingham, Alabama, from the 1890s to the 1910s.

==Legacy==
For his architectural accomplishments, Walter is honored in a ceiling mosaic in the East Mosaic Corridor at the entrance to the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress.

A historical marker highlighting the location of Walter&#x27;s house in Philadelphia was erected in 2009 by the Philadelphia Historical and Museum Commission.

<doc id="713091" wikidata="Q17113040" url="?curid=713091" title="Squee!">
<text>Squee! is a four-issue comic book series by Jhonen Vasquez, published by Slave Labor Graphics, featuring a supporting character from Vasquez&#x27;s previous series &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;. The series was eventually collected as the trade paperback &quot;Squee&#x27;s Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors&quot;.

==Overview==
The series focuses on a young boy named Todd Casil, otherwise known as Squee. An introverted and bullied little kid with a less than supportive family, Squee has been forced to mature a bit more quickly than his peers. He is fond of writing, but only receives criticism from his teacher and taunting from his classmates. Any attempts he makes to deflect these hostilities only results in being shoved into the dirt or otherwise further humiliated. Squee&#x27;s mother is addicted to some form of pill and spends a lot of time lying around in a nearly incoherent state. She often forgets who Squee is, or that she even has a child. His father, painfully aware of Squee&#x27;s existence, loathes the boy and never forgets to mention that he blames Squee for &quot;ruining&quot; his life, claiming that he &quot;hasn&#x27;t smiled once since [Squee] was born&quot;. Having little patience for anything Squee says or does, he eventually becomes convinced that Squee is mentally unstable, and by the end of the series, has him committed to the &quot;Defective Head Meat Institute&quot;. Squee also has a grandfather who justifiably believes his children are only waiting for him to die to collect some kind of inheritance. His grandfather claims to keep healthy and young by consuming his children&#x27;s first-borns, and subsequently attempts to devour Squee, only to reveal in horrifying fashion that he is in fact a cyborg and quite possibly insane.

Squee&#x27;s next door neighbor is Johnny C., also known as &quot;Nny&quot; (pronounced &quot;knee&quot;), the main character of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; (abbreviated &quot;JtHM&quot;). Nny regularly visits Squee late at night by breaking into his room. &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; focused more on the &quot;mentoring&quot; or &quot;big brother&quot; aspect of Nny and Squee&#x27;s relationship, but little interaction occurs in &quot;Squee!&quot;, aside from the occasional drawing or note left in Squee&#x27;s room, or short references to &quot;the crazy neighbor man&quot; (he does appear as an out-patient of &quot;Defective Head Meat Institute&quot;, who Squee is oddly pleased to see). Squee has only one friend, albeit a possibly imaginary one, the dilapidated teddy bear affectionately referred to as Shmee. Only one real person makes any attempt to befriend Squee, a boy named Pepito who happens to be the Antichrist. During the course of the series, Squee encounters a killer chihuahua (that fatally mauls the only classmate who was friendly to him), zombified classmates, sporting mishaps, alien abductions, near recruitment into Satan&#x27;s army, an encounter with his future self, a ghostly visitor, a giant murderous dust mite and eventual committal to a mental institution despite being one of the most sane characters in the comic. These experiences lead him to remark to a &quot;lamb-baby-dog-thing&quot; in one strip that some bitter cartoonist must be drawing his life and therefore he doesn&#x27;t want to get too attached to anyone or anything in it.

==Other notable characters in the series==
===Pepito===
A scene in &quot;JtHM&quot; #4 includes an early appearance of Pepito. This early, slightly different design of Pepito can be seen holding the hand of his mother in the panel in which Devi recalls the day she saw Nny at the bookstore. He also appears, in this same form, in the nightmare Squee has after Johnny leaves his room at the end of &quot;JtHM&quot; #7.

Pepito is a new classmate of Squee&#x27;s who happens to be the Antichrist. Squee secretly agrees with Pepito&#x27;s apocalyptic rantings, but isn&#x27;t quite sure those who have taunted or hurt him in his life really deserve to be punished. After inviting Squee over for dinner one night, Pepito professes his boredom with the human world, and complains to his father, Satan, that he has no one to play with in this &quot;infernal inferno&quot;. This prompts Satan to try and recruit Squee into his dark army by using a metaphor involving breadsticks and nachos, among other things, basically implying that Squee&#x27;s life will be better overall if he would simply give up his soul. Squee politely declines Satan&#x27;s offer and the subject is immediately and permanently dropped. Despite this, Pepito still considers Squee and himself friends.

===Shmee===
Squee carries around with him a dilapidated teddy bear he has named Shmee. Often, Squee talks to Shmee like a real person, confiding in the stuffed toy, who apparently responds though no readable dialogue is ever exchanged between the two, save one strip in which Squee has a conversation with Shmee in his dreams. Shmee claims to be a &quot;trauma sponge&quot;, soaking up all the negative feelings and experiences and storing them inside himself for Squee. He says this will prevent Squee from becoming like Johnny C. During the silent exchanges they share on various occasions, Shmee often suggests that Squee do something violent, like arson in retaliation for some wrong committed against him. Squee laughs these suggestions off, assuming that Shmee is joking, though to the reader it is fairly obvious that he is not.

==Synopsis==
The story is told episodically with little continuity from issue to issue.

===Issue 1===
The series begins with Squee in bed praying for his father to be happy, when he notices that his teddy bear, Shmee is not in bed where he should be, he finds him in the closet where two aliens are waiting to abduct Squee for experiments. Another pair of aliens, who are notably more intelligent than the first pair, show up, and the aliens all argue over who should get to take Squee back with them and perform their tests on him, until the second pair tricks the others and take Squee for themselves. Squee later returns home just in time to go to school the next morning. On the way he sees his only friend get attacked by a small dog after his lunch, who proceeds to drag him into his dog house where he is assumed killed. At school, a new kid named Pepito joins the class, and claims to be the antichrist. Pepito is immediately disgusted by everyone in the class except for Squee who he knows feels the same way as him about the others. Pepito violently attacks the other schoolchildren and decimates the school, until the teacher excuses class for the day.

===Issue 2===
During a family drive, Squee is dropped off at a restaurant to use the restroom. While at the urinal, Squee hears a man in the stall groaning and screaming. As the noise becomes louder and louder, Squee becomes more nervous, until a pool of blood flows out from under the stall and Squee runs out in terror. Later, a man dressed in a large Squee costume appears to Squee on the roof, and claims to be his future self, but before he can say anything noteworthy, the ravages of unperfected time-travel techniques liquefy his spine. That night, Squee dreams he&#x27;s having a conversation with Shmee, who tells him the nature of his existence, that he acts as a &quot;trauma-sponge&quot; for Squee, soaking up all the bad things that happen to him. Grandpa comes for a visit the next day, and attempts to eat Squee to gain vitality.
This issue was created entirely with a paint brush, instead of Vasquez&#x27;s usual pen and ink technique.

===Issue 3===
Squee becomes paranoid that dust mites are everywhere, when a large one falls out of his pillow. Angry at being disturbed, he attempts to kill Squee. Squee is woken up in the night by the ghost of a dead girl who died in his room. At school Squee meets a dog who appears to want to be his friend, but Squee realizes that terrible things happen to anyone around him and so attempts to keep the dog away (Soon after that, the dog was hit by a car) After school Squee is invited to dinner at Pepito&#x27;s house where he meets his Pepito&#x27;s father, Satan (otherwise known as Señor Diablo who also appeared in the sixth issue of &quot;JtHM&quot;) who attempts to recruit him to his Soulless Army of Darkness.

===Issue 4===
Squee is once again approached by the first pair of aliens who attempted to abduct him in issue 1, this time he manages to convince them that it would be smarter for them to take his parents, which they agree to. At school, Squee is bullied by a group of kids and then laughed at by a girl who is then hit with a baseball, causing her eye to pop out and Squee to run away screaming. In class, Squee questions a textbook typo which angers his teacher into ordering the other students to attack him. Squee realizes that his classmates have been turned into zombies by the administration so that they will unquestionably follow the teacher&#x27;s commands. Squee is saved by Pepito who proceeds to destroy the whole school. At home, Squee&#x27;s parents return from their abduction and decide to bring Squee to a mental institution for several weeks, where he is briefly reunited with Johnny C. who is there as a volunteer for sleep study.

==References to Vasquez&#x27;s own life==

While &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; was more about things that angered Vasquez, &quot;Squee!&quot; was about things that terrified him as a child. Many of Squee&#x27;s fears (such as aliens and the monster under the bed) were fears of Vasquez&#x27;s. He stated at the 2006 New York Comic Con that the scene where the chihuahua mauls Squee&#x27;s friend was based on a similar thing that happened to him.

==Animated short==
In 2013, it was revealed that Jhonen Vasquez is working on an animated short based on &quot;Squee!&quot;. It will be called &quot;Squee Versus the Labyrinth of Meat&quot;. As of 2023, the short remains unreleased, Vasquez has not commented on it.

<doc id="713098" wikidata="Q1239302" url="?curid=713098" title="Crime and punishment in the Torah">
<text>The Hebrew Bible is considered a holy text in most Abrahamic religions. It records a large number of events and laws that are endorsed or proscribed by the God of Israel. Judaism teaches that the Torah contains 613 commandments, many of which deal with crime and punishment, but only the Noahide Laws apply to humanity in general. Most Christian denominations have also adopted some of these directives, such as the Ten Commandments and Great Commandment, while a minority believes all Old Covenant laws have been abrogated.

==In the Book of Exodus==
Moses negotiated the Exodus from Egypt with Pharaoh leading to the Ten plagues.

When Pharaoh enslaved the Children of Israel, the Egyptians appointed conscription officers over the Israelites to crush their spirits with hard labor. The Israelites were to build up the cities of Pithom and Ra&#x27;amses as supply centers for Pharaoh. They made the lives of the Israelites miserable with harsh labor involving mortar and bricks, as well as all kinds of work in the field. Then he issued decrees to kill all the Israelite males. God hardened Pharaoh&#x27;s heart, so that he would not allow the Hebrews to leave, and then God sent various disasters onto the whole of Egypt. Exodus includes the story of the killing of every firstborn child in Egypt as the final punishment for having enslaved the Israelites.

== The Midianites ==

In Numbers 25, the people of Midian together with Moab began to interact with the people of Israel, who were staying in Shittim. At this time, Israelite men began to have sexual relations with Moabite women. After being invited by Moabite women, some Israelite men participated in eating sacrificial meals and worshipping Moabite deities. The then ordered a daylight execution of all those that had fornicated and worshipped with the Moabites. 

While the Israelites were still assembled in mourning after the execution, an Israelite man, Zimri the son of Salu, publicly brought a Midianite woman, Cozbi daughter of Zur, into his tent. Phinehas, a grandson of Aaron, left the assembly, went inside the tent, and drove a javelin through both Zimri and Cozbi. Because of Phinehas&#x27; act, the &#x27;s wrath was turned away from the children of Israel. The then ordered Moses to attack the Midianites for plotting against the Israelites in the matters of Peor and Cozbi.

After an army of 12,000 (1000 from each tribe) was sent against the Midianites, Moses was angry when the army returned with captive women and other spoils, because the women had played vital roles in the previous trespasses and consequent plague.

Moses then ordered all males and non-virgin females killed, and all female virgins preserved. One of every five hundred remaining captives of the soldiers&#x27; plunder was to be put in service as tribute to the under Eleazar the priest (Numbers 31:28) as &quot;heave offerings&quot;, thanksgiving for success. Out of the booty that belonged to Israelites, one of every fifty was set apart to the Levites who cared for the Tabernacle. (Numbers 31:30)

== Special punishments ==

*Noah cursed Canaan to be a servant to his brother&#x27;s servants and a servant to his fathers brothers. (see Curse of Ham)
*Lot&#x27;s wife &quot;became a pillar of salt&quot; when she &quot;looked back&quot; when fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah&#x27;s destruction.
*God killed Onan for depriving his sister-in-law of child by having sex with her with no intention of impregnating her as agreed. After Onan&#x27;s brother Er died, his father Judah told him to fulfill his duty as a &quot;brother-in-law&quot; to Tamar, by giving her offspring. Centuries later, in the days of Moses, this practice was formulated into a law of a Levirate marriage, where the brother of the deceased would provide offspring to the childless widow to preserve the family line. However, when Onan had sex with Tamar, he disregarded this principle when he withdrew before climax and spilled his semen on the ground, since any child born would not legally be considered his heir. ()

== Examples of the death penalty ==

The Bible prescribes the death penalty for the following activities, among others:
* Murder
* Adultery
* Bestiality
* Rape of a betrothed virgin
* One man picked up sticks on the Sabbath, he was taken into custody because a punishment was not known. The told Moses that the man in custody must be killed. This particular crime and punishment is isolated case law.()
* The man and woman when a man meets a betrothed woman in town and sleeps with her. But if it is a case of rape where out in the country she called for help and no one heard, the death penalty only applies to the man
* A woman who is found not to have been a virgin on the night of her wedding
* Worshiping other gods
* Witchcraft
* Taking the &#x27;s name in vain or cursing his name
* Cursing a parent
* Kidnapping
* Rebellion against parents
* Having a spirit of divination

== Implementation ==
There is some question as to whether the death penalty was invariably or even usually implemented in ancient Israel, or whether this was even the intention of the Tanakh (c.f. Numbers 35:31). &quot;It must be noted that the death penalty might also indicate the seriousness of the crime without calling for the actual implementation of it in every case. In fact, there is little evidence that many of these sanctions were ever actually carried out in ancient Israel. Only in the case of premeditated murder was there the added stricture of &#x27;Do not accept a ransom for the life of the murderer who deserves to die&#x27; (Num 35:31). . . . Traditional wisdom, both in the Jewish and Christian communities, interpreted this verse in Numbers 35:31 to mean that out of the almost twenty cases calling for capital punishment in the Old Testament, every one of them could have the sanction commuted by an appropriate substitute of money or anything that showed the seriousness of the crime, but in the case of what we today call first-degree murder, there was never to be offered or accepted any substitute or bargaining of any kind: the offender had to pay with his or her life&quot;.

<doc id="713132" wikidata="Q1934294" url="?curid=713132" title="Very Proud of Ya">
<text>Very Proud of Ya is the second studio album by American rock band AFI. It was released on June 18, 1996, through Nitro Records.

==Background==
The liner notes of the album state that all the tracks are copyrighted to Anthems for Insubordinates, while the mailing address states the band&#x27;s name as Asking for It. It is the last album to feature bassist Geoff Kresge, who illustrated the album cover as well. The album features future band member Jade Puget performing back-up vocals. It was recorded in about a week.

In a 2010 interview, Kresge mentioned that several additional songs and guitar solos were omitted due to time constraints, as a result the band re-recorded several songs that had been previously released.

The tracks &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; and &quot;Yürf Rendenmein&quot; were re-recorded from their debut album &quot;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&quot;. The title of &quot;Love is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; is a reference to the song of the same name by Sammy Fain and Paul Francis Webster, although it is not a cover.

A music video, the band&#x27;s first, was made for &quot;He Who Laughs Last...&quot; Directed by Darren Doane and Ken Daurio, it draws inspiration from the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990).

The songs &quot;Cruise Control&quot; and &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot; were used in the 1996 independent film &quot;Mary Jane&#x27;s Not a Virgin Anymore&quot;, which was first screened in 1997 and also features Havok in a small role.

In 1993, the FM Towns Marty was released; it is a game console compatible with existing FM Towns games.

The &quot;FM&quot; part of the name means &quot;Fujitsu Micro&quot; like their earlier products, while the &quot;Towns&quot; part is derived from the code name the system was assigned while in development, &quot;Townes&quot;. This refers to Charles Townes, one of the winners of the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics, following a custom of Fujitsu at the time to code name PC products after Nobel Prize winners. The e in &quot;Townes&quot; was dropped when the system went into production to make it clearer that the term was to be pronounced like the word &quot;towns&quot; rather than the potential &quot;tow-nes&quot;.

== History ==
Fujitsu decided to release a new home computer after the FM-7 was technologically overcome by NEC&#x27;s PC-8801. During the life of the FM-7, Fujitsu learnt that software sales drove hardware sales, and in order to acquire usable software quickly, the new computer was to be based on Fujitsu&#x27;s &quot;FMR50&quot; system architecture. The FMR50 system, released at 1986, was another x86/DOS-based computer similar to NEC&#x27;s popular PC-9801. The FMR50 computers were sold with moderate success in Japanese offices, particularly in Japanese government offices. There were hundreds of software packages available for the FMR, including Lotus 1-2-3, WordStar, Multiplan, and dBASE III. With this basis of compatibility, the more multimedia-friendly FM Towns was created.

NEC&#x27;s PC-9801 computers were widespread and dominated in the 1980s, at one point reaching 70% of the 16/32-bit computer market, but the early models had limited graphics (640×400 with 16 of 4096 colors) and sounds (4-operator/3 voice monaural FM sounds + 3 channel SSG sounds). Just as Commodore saw an opening for the Amiga in some global markets against the IBM PC, a computer with improved graphics and sound was considered to overcome the PC-9801 in the home-use field in Japan.

With many multimedia innovations for its time, the FM Towns was that system, though for a number of reasons it never broke far beyond the boundaries of its niche market status.

Eventually, the FM Towns lost much of its uniqueness by adding a DOS/V (PC clone plus DOS with native Japanese language support) compatibility mode switch, until Fujitsu finally discontinued making FM Towns specific hardware and software and moved to focus on the IBM PC clones (Fujitsu FMV) that many Japanese manufacturers - who previously were not players in the PC market - were building by the mid to late 1990s. To this day, Fujitsu is known for its laptop PCs globally, and FM Towns (and Marty) users have been relegated to a small community of aficionados.

== Overview ==
Several variants were built; the first system (FM TOWNS model1 and model2) is based on an Intel 80386DX processor running at a clock speed of 16 MHz, with the option of adding an 80387 FPU, features one or two megabytes of RAM (with a possible maximum of 6 MB), one or two 3.5&quot; floppy disk drives, a PCMCIA memory card slot and a single-speed CD-ROM drive. Its package includes a gamepad, a mouse and a microphone.

The earlier, more distinctive models featuring a vertical CD-ROM tray on the front of the case (model1, model2, 1F, 2F, 1H, 2H, 10F and 20F) were often referred to as the &quot;Gray&quot; Towns, and were the ones most directly associated with the &quot;FM Towns&quot; brand. Most featured 3 memory expansion slots and used 72-pin non-parity SIMMs with a required timing of 100ns or less and a recommended timing of 60ns.

Hard drives are not standard equipment, and are not required for most uses. The OS is loaded from CD-ROM by default. A SCSI Centronics 50/SCSI-1/Full-Pitch port is provided for connecting external SCSI disk drives, and is the most common way to connect a hard drive to an FM Towns PC. Although internal drives are rare, there is a hidden compartment with a SCSI 50-pin connector where a hard drive may be connected, but the power supply module does not typically provide the required Molex connector to power the drive.

The video output is 15 kHz RGB (though some programs used a 31 kHz mode) using the same DB15 connector and pinouts as the PC-9801.

=== Operating system ===
The operating system used is Windows 3.0/3.1/95 and a graphical OS called Towns OS, based on MS-DOS and the Phar Lap DOS extender (RUN386.EXE). Most games for the system were written in protected mode Assembly and C using the Phar Lap DOS extender. These games usually utilize the Towns OS API (TBIOS) for handling several graphic modes, sprites, sounds, a mouse, gamepads, and CD-audio.

The FM Towns is capable of booting its graphical Towns OS straight from CD in 1989 - two years before Amiga CDTV booted its GUI-based AmigaOS 1.3 from internal CD drive and the CD-bootable System 7 was released for the Macintosh in 1991, and five years before the El Torito specification standardized boot-CDs on IBM PC compatibles in 1994.

To boot the system from CD-ROM, the FM TOWNS has a &quot;hidden C:&quot; ROM drive in which a minimum MS-DOS system, CD-ROM driver and codice_1 are installed. This minimal DOS system runs first, and the DOS system reads and executes the Towns OS IPL stored in CD-ROM after that. The Towns OS CD-ROM has an IPL, MS-DOS system (codice_2, DOS extender, and Towns API (TBIOS).

A minimal DOS system that allows the CD-ROM drive to be accessed is contained in a system ROM; this, coupled with Fujitsu&#x27;s decision to charge only a minimal license fee for the inclusion of a bare-bones Towns OS on game CD-ROMs, allows game developers to make games bootable directly from CD-ROM without the need for a boot floppy or hard disk.

Various Linux and BSD distributions have also been ported to the FM Towns system, including Debian and Gentoo.

=== Graphics ===
The FM Towns features a custom Fujitsu graphics chip, enabling video modes ranging from 320×200 to 720×512 resolutions, with 16 to 32,768 simultaneous colors out of a possible 4096 to 16 million (depending on the video mode); most of these video modes have two memory pages, and it allows the use of up to 1024 sprites of 16×16 pixels each. It also has a built-in font ROM for the display of kanji characters.

The system has the ability to overlay different video modes; for example, the 320×200 video mode with 32,768 colors can be overlaid with a 640×480 mode using 16 colors, which allows games to combine high-color graphics with high-resolution kanji text.

It uses 640 KB of video RAM, including 512 KB VRAM and 128 KB sprite RAM.

Sprite layer:

* Resolution: 256×240 pixels
* Colors: 256 on screen out of 32,768 palette
* Sprite RAM: 128 KB (8 KB attributes, 120 KB pattern/colour data)
* Maximum sprite count: Up to 1024 on screen
* Sprite size: 16×16 pixels
* Colors per sprite: 16
* Overlay support: Bitmap modes 1-11

Up to two graphical layers can be overlaid, whether it is two bitmap layers, or the sprite layer with a bitmap background layer. The latter is useful for action games, though the sprite function is not as advanced as that of rival 32-bit computer, the Sharp X68000. When the sprite layer is used, it is rendered to VRAM layer 1 on top, with the bitmap background as VRAM layer 0 below. When two bitmap layers are used, then both are rendered to VRAM layers 0 and 1.

=== Sound ===
The FM Towns system is able to play regular audio CDs, and also supports the use of 8 PCM voices and 6 FM channels, using the Ricoh RF5c68 and Yamaha YM2612 sound chips, respectively. The system has ports in the front to accommodate karaoke, LEDs to indicate volume level, and software to add popular voice-altering effects such as echoes.

Games on the FM Towns regularly use Red Book Audio CD music tracks, especially if they are designed specifically for the Fujitsu system. Games ported from the PC-9801, for instance, might have used only PCM/FM music. This was a novelty and innovation far ahead of other PCs of the time made possible by the standard CD-ROM drive found in every FM Towns computer.

====Ricoh RF5c68====
The Ricoh RF5c68 is an eight-channel sound chip developed by Ricoh. It is notably used in Fujitsu&#x27;s FM Towns computer series, along with Sega&#x27;s System 18 and System 32 arcade game system boards.

The RF5c68 supports eight 8-bit PCM channels, with 19.6 kHz or variable sampling rate. Audio bit depth ranges from 8-bit to 10-bit.

The character has endured as a recurring antagonist of the superhero Doctor Strange.

Dormammu has appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including films, animated television series, toys, trading cards, and video games. He made his live-action debut in the 2016 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, performed through motion capture by Benedict Cumberbatch and voiced by a mixture of Cumberbatch and an unidentified British actor.

==Publication history==

Dormammu first appeared in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #126–127 (Nov.–Dec. 1964), but had been mentioned previously in dialogue, along with his realm the &quot;Dark Dimension&quot;.

Writer Mike Conroy said:

After being established as the ruler of an alternate dimension (later described as the god-tyrant of its denizens), Dormammu became a perennial foe of Sorcerer Supreme Doctor Strange, who until this time had dealt almost exclusively with off-beat &quot;one-off&quot; mystical threats in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #110–125 (July 1963 – Oct. 1964). Strange&#x27;s first encounter with Dormammu in the &quot;Dark Dimension&quot; also introduced Clea, eventually revealed to be the niece of the villain (like Clea&#x27;s name, this was not initially revealed in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #126; Nov. 1964), and the monstrous and imprisoned Mindless Ones.

The character&#x27;s major appearances include starring in an epic fifteen issue storyline in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #131–146 (Apr. 1965 – July 1966); the discovery that Dormammu has a sister, Umar, and both are in fact mystical beings called &quot;Faltine&quot; in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #150 (Nov. 1966); teaming with fellow villain Loki to instigate the &quot;Avengers-Defenders War&quot; in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #115–118 (Sept.–Dec. 1973) and &quot;The Defenders&quot; #8–11 (Sept.–Dec. 1973); &quot;Thor&quot; Annual #9 (1981); &quot;Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme&quot; #1–2 (Nov. 1988 &amp; Jan. 1989) and the limited series &quot;Doctor Strange: The Flight of the Bones&quot; #1–4 (Feb.–May 1999) and &quot;Hellcat&quot; #1–3 (Sept.–Nov. 2000).

After a major appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #498–500 (Oct.–Dec. 2003), Dormammu became the patron of small-time villain the Hood in &quot;The New Avengers&quot; #46 (Dec. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
===1960s===
Dormammu is first mentioned by Karl Amadeus Mordo, senior apprentice of the Ancient One, who serves as the &quot;Sorcerer Supreme&quot; and protector of Earth. Secretly in the entity&#x27;s service, Mordo attempts to slowly weaken the Ancient One as a means of enabling Dormammu to finally extend his rule to Earth, but is stopped when his fellow pupil Stephen Strange alerts his master to the betrayal.

The character later appears in person when sending a messenger to boast his renewed intentions of conquering his universe before his aging adversary. In response, Doctor Strange travels to Dormammu&#x27;s &quot;Dark Dimension&quot; as the Ancient One does not consider himself powerful enough to defeat Dormammu and manages to overcome all supernatural servitors sent against him. Dormammu engages Strange in mystic combat and shows himself to be far more powerful, but, when drawing upon the realm&#x27;s energies, inadvertently weakens the barrier containing the horde of Mindless Ones. Since they threatened Dormammu&#x27;s subjects, Strange helped his enemy to re-seal the juggernauts by letting power from his amulet flow into Dormammu. Indebted to Strange for his help, Dormammu ends the fight, and in return Strange demands a binding vow to never enter the &quot;Earth realm&quot; again and to not harm Clea. Dormammu complies, but gains a burning hatred against Strange for the humiliation.

Dormammu uses a loophole to his oath by granting Mordo vast power, whereupon the sorcerer leads his minions on a lengthy hunt for Strange and abduct the Ancient One as a bargaining chip. Dormammu&#x27;s niece, Clea, assists Strange by weakening the barrier of the Mindless Ones, forcing her uncle to focus elsewhere. Dormammu learns of her betrayal, brings all three Earth sorcerers to a neutral realm, to let her see his disciple destroy Strange, and summons fellow &quot;Lords of the Netherworlds&quot; to watch the spectacle. When Strange begins to get an advantage against Mordo, Dormammu decides to face the sorcerer in a contest of pure hand-to-hand-combat. The physically stronger entity eventually falls to his foe&#x27;s greater familiarity with martial arts. To Dormammu&#x27;s humiliation, before the gathered Lords, Strange forces him to vow not to menace the Earth even by proxy. The villain strikes a parting blow by banishing Clea and inciting another lord to attack Strange.

In an apparent bid for power the character engages the universal embodiment, Eternity, in single combat, but is defeated and banished.

Dormammu captures Clea, and overpowers and imprisons Strange. The sorcerer manipulates Umar into freeing him, and then surprises Dormammu by pushing him through a portal to the Earth. This makes the entity wither from the curse cast by his own power, when vowing to never enter the Earth realm, and he departs to his own plane.

===1970s===
Dormammu enters into an alliance with the Asgardian Loki and tricks superhero teams the Avengers and Defenders into fighting each other for components of the artifact known as the Evil Eye. The Eye is reassembled, and allows Dormammu to merge his own universe with all the planets of the &quot;regular&quot; Marvel Universe without breaking his vow. Dormammu imprisons the traitorous Loki and effortlessly overwhelms all of his other opponents, leaving only the Scarlet Witch. When Loki escapes and distracts Dormammu, the Scarlet Witch casts a hex on the Eye that causes it to absorb Dormammu, and costs Loki his sanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avengers/Defenders War&quot;&gt;&quot;Avengers/Defenders War&quot; from:
* &lt;/ref&gt;

After being seen in flashback, the character manages to reintegrate himself on Earth, but is recovering slowly to full strength. Together with Umar, Dormammu captures the elder goddess Gaea, and seeks revenge against the Scarlet Witch by kidnapping her and her mentor Agatha Harkness from her wedding to the Vision. After Wanda and Agatha remove the heat needed for his regeneration, he departs for his own realm. Immediately afterwards, he attempts to destroy Doctor Strange and Clea. He is betrayed by Umar, who steals his power and allows the character to be banished from Earth.

Dormammu tricks Strange into battling both the demon Ghost Rider and the Bounty Hunter in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Strange. Dormammu appears in a &quot;What If...?&quot; alternate universe story as Strange&#x27;s master in that reality.

===1980s===
Dormammu acts as the envoy of Lord Chaos and plays against Odin in a cosmic chess match whose outcome decides the universal balance of chaos and order. Umar attempts to rig the game in her brother&#x27;s favor by manipulating Odin&#x27;s son Thor unsuccessfully, and the game ends in a draw.

Dormammu&#x27;s agent Baron Mordo travels back in time to London in the year 1943, where he allies with the aristocrats Viscount Krowler and Sir Anthony Baskerville. Dormammu possesses Krowler, and begins to manifest on the Earth plane by absorbing power from the destruction of World War II, but he is banished by Doctor Strange.

The character reappears during the &quot;Inferno&quot; storyline. Strange, following an arduous confrontation with Shuma-Gorath, heals through a process that takes him through various mystical realms. This allows Dormammu to attach himself to his foe, and possess the sorcerer&#x27;s body, which exempts him from the vow to not directly enter the Earth-realm. Summoning extraterrestrial sorcerers as his lieutenants, Dormammu vows to &quot;burn&quot; and replace the Celestials as the greatest power in the Earth&#x27;s universe, but is distracted and tricked by Clea and Strange (his consciousness occupying a rat), while their ally Topaz exorcises Dormammu&#x27;s presence.

===1990s===
The character reconstitutes again, regains control of the Dark Dimension from Clea by subverting her will, and summons her parents, Umar and Orini, from exile. Umar and Baron Mordo join forces with Clea and Doctor Strange. The enraged Dormammu threatens to completely destroy the &quot;Dark Dimension&quot; in retaliation, but Umar convinces him to accept a compromise as the ruler of a sub-realm, whereas his sister takes over rulership from Clea, with Mordo as her consort. Clea agrees to abdicate rather than see all of her people killed, but promises to return if Umar becomes a tyrant again. Dormammu finds that he has been tricked into becoming the ruler of the realm of the Mindless Ones.

After two brief appearances, Dormammu, in the guise of another of the Faltine, manipulates Clea into recruiting allies from the Lords of the Netherworlds to depose her mother. This frees Dormammu to reclaim his realm. He absorbs Umar and Mordo into himself, becoming more powerful than ever before, and he disintegrates the assembled entities.

Strange, at the time weakened without support from the &quot;Principalities&quot;, confronts Dormammu with his allies Clea, the Silver Surfer, Hulk, and Ghost Rider, but they are unable to cause any injury to the villain. Strange journeys into the core of Dormammu&#x27;s essence and uses the Eye of Agamotto to strip away his self-delusion, and make him acknowledge that his thirst for chaos, power, and conquest are unworthy of a being of his stature. Dormammu is momentarily shaken, and appears to be defeated, but this is only a mirage. The villain gloats that he has not shown &quot;one tenth&quot; of his true power against the heroes, but that he now realizes that rulership of &quot;one puny&quot; universe is beneath his notice, as he now has far greater and &quot;more interesting&quot; ambitions, and contemptuously dismisses the &quot;insignificant mortals&quot;.

The character observes the Guardians of the Galaxy—adventurers from the 31st century of Earth-691—travel to the mainstream era of Earth-616. Dormammu follows them back to their dimension, merges with his counterpart in this timeline, doubling his power, and attacks their headquarters, demanding the presence of the Doctor Strange of their time. Strange, now called the Ancient One, arrives with his disciple, the alien Krugarr, and battles Dormammu, assisted by the Guardians, the &quot;Galactic Guardians&quot;, and the Phoenix Force. Dormammu kills the elderly Strange, and almost overwhelms his other foes, but is defeated when Krugarr summons the spirit of Strange, and they channel the combined power of everyone in the assembly to banish Dormammu to his home dimension.

Dormammu appears as the guiding force behind an attack on the self-titled Goddess during &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot; storyline. During &quot;The Flight of the Bones&quot; storyline the character is revealed as the instigator behind a series of spontaneous combustions of criminals and an attack on an ally of Strange by cultists.

===2000s===
Dormammu uses the demon lord Satannish (revealed as his creation) and warlock Nicholas Scratch to lead his Demonic armies to capture five of the inter-dimensional places of Hell, in a plot to eventually conquer all life and afterlife. Dormammu, however, is thwarted when the heroine Hellcat rallies the powers of Hell to weaken the character by engineering a complete absence of mystic flame. Dormammu also allies with the entity Mephisto to drive an attacking force out of their respective dimensions.

Dormammu sends an army of Mindless Ones to attack the city of New York, and trick several prominent Marvel superheroes into unintentionally making him materialize on Earth by tricking them into combining dimensional energies in an attempt to dispel the Mindless Ones. Doctor Strange engages Dormammu in combat, and sends the hero Spider-Man back in time to a critical moment to stop his enemy from being able to re-enter Earth&#x27;s universe, Spider-Man warning the heroes to delay in their attempts to stop the Mindless Ones long enough for the younger Strange to show up and banish them himself.

Dormammu returns, now in a symbiotic link with Umar. Together they petition the &quot;Pan-dimensional Oversight Council&quot; (counting Strange and Nightmare among its members) to perform a preemptive strike against Earth&#x27;s superhumans, as &quot;potential weapons of mass destruction&quot;, and when the petition fails, Dormammu eats most of the present council-members, whereas Umar reduces the rest to &quot;screaming blobs of mindless jelly&quot;. The siblings then attack and overcome the entity Eternity, and use the acquired power to remake all universes in their hellish image. The pair are opposed by a reuniting of some of the original Defenders (Strange, the Hulk, and Namor the Sub-Mariner), with Dormammu retreating when Umar steals his power. The character also appears briefly during a storyline in which Strange contemplates his past.

Acting in secrecy, Dormammu empowers criminal mastermind the Hood, who in turn resurrects several dead supervillains and forms a crime army. When the Hood asks for information about his &quot;benefactor&quot; from the demoness Satana, she claims that Dormammu disposed of his sister off-page.

The character temporarily takes control of the &quot;zombie&quot; virus that decimates Earth-2149, and also takes advantage of the fact that Strange loses the title of Sorcerer Supreme, but the latter eventually exorcises his influence from the Hood together with Daimon Hellstrom and Doctor Voodoo.

===2010s===
Dormammu briefly appears when the newly appointed &quot;Sorcerer Supreme&quot; Doctor Voodoo enters his domain. The villain dismisses Voodoo as an &quot;unworthy&quot; opponent and refers to his vastly inferior &quot;gutter gods&quot;. This, however, causes Voodoo to strengthen the seals to the entity&#x27;s realm. The character also appears as one of the prospective &quot;suitors&quot; (holders of a slave-contract) for the hand of Satana.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Dormammu attended the Devil&#x27;s Advocacy where they talked about the threat of the Serpent on Earth.

Dormammu appears in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. After Illyana Rasputin is pulled into Limbo it is revealed that Dormammu is responsible for taking over the realm. Dormammu is apparently killed by Illyana off-page.

The entity reappears with a plot to turn humanity into Mindless Ones, but is thwarted by the plans of Phil Coulson, with help from the Absorbing Man and the Howling Commandos.

During the &quot;Damnation&quot; storyline, Doctor Strange&#x27;s soul comes across Dormammu in the Realm Between at the time when Mephisto is causing trouble in Las Vegas.

==Characteristics==

=== Personality ===
Dormammu has been described as &quot;something worse than a demon.&quot; It is unknown exactly how ancient he is, as he inhabits a wholly alien realm, separate from the rest of the Marvel Universe, that defies the laws of physics as understood on Earth. He is known to have already existed at the creation of the current demonic netherworlds; to have clashed with Agamotto hundreds of millions of years ago; to have served as the primary enemy of the Vishanti ever since; and to have been considered an extreme threat by the mages of &quot;pre-cataclysm&quot; Atlantis.

Dormammu is presented as the most powerful and malevolent of &quot;the Faltine&quot;, higher-dimensional mystical energy beings. Not native to the &quot;Dark Dimension&quot;, Dormammu and &quot;his&quot; sibling Umar were exiled for slaying their progenitor &quot;Sinifer&quot; and for their morbid/unclean obsession with physical matter. They journeyed to the Dark Dimension in search of experience, and assumed corporeal forms. Dormammu merged with the local &quot;Flames of Regency&quot; to further enhance his power, and returned to an energy state, whereas Umar had grown accustomed to physical pleasure. After imprisoning the horde of marauding virtually unstoppable Mindless Ones, Dormammu enslaved the entire realm and demanded worship as its sole deity. He continued to gradually merge other mystical universes to his own, while spreading his worship to any sorcerers throughout the multiverse who invoked his powers.

The character is sometimes shown as incredibly patient, with certain plots to achieve his goals spanning billions of years, whereas others are planned far more recently or even improvised through opportunity. Although extremely intelligent, with tremendous knowledge of the mystic arts, he is overwhelmingly arrogant, generally does not adapt well to sudden confusion and unexpected developments, and has a tendency to gloat over technically outmatched foes rather than swiftly finish them off. What makes Dormammu different from other prominent Marvel supervillains is that he has been shown as fully capable of personally defeating cosmic entities, even without external power sources and outside of the &quot;Dark Dimension&quot;.

Dormammu and his sister Umar have an unpredictable love-hate relationship. Sometimes loyal and collaborative, other times they gladly betray each other or take the other&#x27;s power for themselves. Umar has an occasional tendency to sarcastically puncture her brother&#x27;s obsessive histrionics with more pragmatic sadistic hedonism.

Writer Keith Giffen has described them as &quot;Donnie and Marie from hell. The brother-sister sibling rivalry relationship blown up to nightmarish, universe-shattering proportions.&quot; Nevertheless, Dormammu is &quot;completely inhuman&quot;, the kind of character that &quot;commits mass murder... on a whim&quot;.

=== Powers and abilities ===
Dormammu is acknowledged by Doctor Strange as his &quot;most terrible foe.&quot; He is described as a threat to &quot;the life of the universe itself&quot; that &quot;at full power no one could stand against.&quot; He has been displayed approaching a universal or even multiversal scale of influence.

The character can project energy bolts and beams. He is able to alter his size and teleport across dimensions. He can use his powers to travel through time. Dormammu can give a portion of his powers to others and turn them into powerful beings. He has the ability to resurrect the dead. He is able to manipulate matter to alter and shape objects. Dormammu has the power to manipulate reality. The character can possess the body of another being. He also appears to be immortal.

Dormammu is seemingly stronger in the Dark Dimension, as he is empowered by the worship of his followers.

<text>Weapon Plus is a fictional clandestine program appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It was created by Grant Morrison during their run in &quot;New X-Men&quot;. The program&#x27;s purpose is the creation of super-soldiers intended to fight the wars of the future, especially a mutant-human war. Weapon X, the organization&#x27;s most well-known program, was originally the tenth installation, but eventually it branched off and became an independent program with similar purposes. Morrison&#x27;s introduction of Weapon Plus also shed new information about the origins of Weapon X, Captain America, and other Marvel Comics supersoldiers.

==Fictional team history==
During the 1940s the existence of mutants was not yet known to the general public. A few individuals were aware of the coming of &quot;Homo superior&quot; and the fact that they had the potential to replace baseline humans as the dominant species of Earth. Thus Weapon Plus was created to address the so-called mutant problem. What was unknown by everyone involved in Weapon Plus is that its mastermind, John Sublime, was actually the host body for a sentient bacteria present in every living creature on the planet, save for mutants, who were genetically immune to the Sublime infection.

The first nine instalments of Weapon Plus were partially successful. Weapon X produced a number of agents, though it branched off and even became opposed to Weapon Plus&#x27;s interests. To prevent subsidiary programs from going rogue, Weapon Plus directly oversaw the creation of the last living weapons operating in the clandestine facilities of &quot;The World&quot;, employing Bolivar Trask&#x27;s Sentinel technology.

Throughout the decades, Weapon Plus has used increasingly more extreme methods to create its super-soldiers. Captain America was enhanced to peak human levels. Weapon X employed genetic alteration, brainwashing and memory implants. The latest creations were bred specifically to become mutant-hunting weapons much deadlier than Sentinels.

Following M-Day, most of mutantkind has been rendered powerless, and mutants as a race are on the brink of extinction. Weapon Plus appears again as Sublime attempts to use the Stepford Cuckoos to wipe out the surviving mutants.

==Programs==

===Before Weapon I===
Project: Rebirth began as a collaboration between the American, British and German eugenicists led by Doctors Josef Reinstein (later known as Abraham Erskine) and Koch. When World War II began, Koch took over the German program, and Reinstein moved to the American program.

John Steele, also known as American Soldier, was a Super-Soldier of unknown origin who fought in World War I. His body was kept in stasis by Nazi scientists, including Abraham Erskine, who sought to replicate his abilities as part of Project: Nietzche, but with little success.

===Weapon I===
Project: Rebirth, headed by Professor Abraham Erskine (given the alias Josef Reinstein as a cover identity) managed to produce Captain America (Steve Rogers). However, Erskine was murdered moments after Rogers was successfully enhanced. The refinements he introduced which made the process successful were lost with his death. With his demise, Koch took over the American program.

Two other subjects, Clinton McIntyre, a.k.a. Protocide, a failed experiment who was placed in suspended animation and was revived in the modern era by AIM, and the first mutant experiment designated Queen seem to have occurred prior to the Super Soldier Serum being tested on Steve Rogers.

Early attempts to recreate the formula resulted in African American super soldiers (most prominently Isaiah Bradley). Three hundred African-American soldiers were taken from Camp Cathcart and subjected to potentially fatal experiments at an undisclosed location, as seen in &quot;&quot; in an attempt to recreate the Super Soldier formula. Only five men survived the original trials; hundreds of test subjects left behind at Camp Cathcart and the camp&#x27;s commander were executed by US soldiers in the name of secrecy, the families of the three hundred were told that they had died in battle. Isaiah Bradley was the lone survivor.

Although there were many later attempts to recreate or reverse-engineer Project: Rebirth&#x27;s Super-Soldier Serum, none are known to have been involved with Weapon Plus except for the attempt that resulted in the creation of Isaiah Bradley&#x27;s son Josiah X. Weapon Plus considers Captain America as its most successful creation, despite the fact that Rogers has been at odds with the United States government a number of times. Project: Rebirth was retroactively made a part of the Weapon Plus after WWII when Weapon Plus was actually formed.

===Weapon II===
Weapon II experimented on animals. It was implied by Grant Morrison that these animal weapons were the animal cyborgs in the comic &quot;We3&quot;, not published by Marvel.

Weapon II was later captured as part of a group of semi-animal characters including Howard the Duck, Squirrel Girl, Beast, and Rocket Raccoon. He appeared as a squirrel with Wolverine&#x27;s &quot;Adamantium skeleton, claws, intelligence, and healing factor&quot; (though his claws make a &quot;SNUKT&quot; sound compared to Wolverine&#x27;s &quot;SNIKT&quot;). Weapon II also sports a visor and many of Wolverine&#x27;s mannerisms.

In &quot;Wolverine and Captain America Weapon Plus #1&quot; (July 2019), it is implied that the team Brute Force, made of animal cyborg hybrids, was part of the Weapon II program.

===Weapon III===
Like Weapons II and IV, Weapon III was originally said to be experiments on animals, however, this was later retconned.

Weapon III (Harry Pizer) was a mutant with elastic multi-sensory skin. Originally a barrister, he was recruited by the Weapon Plus program to help protect his nation from the approaching Cold War. His skin&#x27;s durability and elasticity was enhanced. He originally worked in espionage, gathering intelligence from the Soviets.

He was eventually sent to Otherworld in order to retrieve the Orb of Necromancy. However he was stopped by Fantomex and, for the many deaths he caused, subsequently punished by the Captain Britain Corps and flayed alive, his skin machined off and used to form sentient bullets, some of which came to be possessed by Genoshan soldiers. He survived, however, and taught his muscles to function in a similar manner to his former mutant skin.

He later worked with Black Air and the Brotherhood of Mutants and was known as the Skinless Man. He developed a hatred of Fantomex, who he blamed for his current state. He later murdered Fantomex by ripping out his heart. He was later killed in retaliation by Deadpool.

===Weapon IV===
Weapon IV, was said to be employed on various criminals that were ethnic minorities as test subjects. However, Weapon IV is actually &#x27;Project Sulfur&#x27; - the project spearheaded by Ted Sallis, whose research led him to become the Man-Thing.

===Weapon V===
Weapon V was originally believed to have been performed on ethnic people, but then during the Vietnam War, then S.H.I.E.L.D sponsored program under the pseudonym of Sym-soldier used pieces of the ancient symbiote named Grendel and bonded them to various able bodied operatives in order to fight in the conflict. However, the program was shut down after said enhanced specimens were driven mad by their second skins, having later been captured by Nick Fury and Logan.
When the government got hold of the Venom symbiote, they decided to use it as part of Weapon V under the name of Project Rebirth 2.0 to create a new soldier with symbiote augmentation. They bonded the suit to former veteran Flash Thompson which resulted in the creation of Agent Venom.

Project Rebirth 2.0 is later shut down by Captain America.

The project would resume behind closed doors under the Weapon + director William Junger&#x27;s supervision. Supplanting volunteers from a mercenary unit hailing out of Eaglestar International as waiting test subjects for virochemically neutered symbiote samples. The Klyntar used would purposely have their hive link severed so that the presence behind their proginator wouldn&#x27;t irrevocably madden its hosts. But it was again put on ice when the demiurgically anointed Dark Carnage went on a killing spree, collecting &amp; harvesting Klyntar derived codex samples from the project, Mars Team and its supervisor Dr. Breen. Whom offered himself and what remains of the symbiote clad armorines in willing sacrifice to Knull&#x27;s chosen after being corrupted by the Grendel samples he&#x27;d used on himself.

===Weapon VI===
Weapon VI was led by Dr. Noah Burstein and was responsible for giving Luke Cage his powers.

===Weapon VII===
Weapon VII, a.k.a. Project: Homegrown, experimented on human soldiers during the Vietnam War. Some of the known participants who died in Project: Homegrown included Andrew Perlmutter, Michael Labash, John Walsh, James MacPherson and fourteen other unknown recruits. The only known successful subject of Project: Homegrown was Nuke, who had armored implants under his epidermis and was addicted to powerful narcotics. Logan, who would later become one of Weapon Plus&#x27; victims, kidnapped Nuke as a child, and oversaw his conditioning.

Weapon VII also experimented with adamantium bonding, which helped create Cyber.

The United Kingdom also had its own version of Project: Homegrown, a.k.a. the Black Budget, which managed to create the team known as the Super Soldiers: Dauntless, Gog, Dreadnaught, Revenge, Victory, Invincible, Challenger, and some unnamed super-soldiers.

The Mercy Corporation, an offshoot of S.H.I.E.L.D. that worked on super-soldiers and eventually broke off, also had its own unit of super-soldiers, using a serum similar to previous derivatives of the Super-Soldier Serum from Weapon I. Their agents included Jack Reno, Keel, Kyle, Agent Villarosa, Agent Davis and Agent Milo.

===Weapon VIII===
Weapons VIII experimented on criminals and psychopaths.

===Weapon IX===
Weapon IX (according to artist Rob Liefeld) was originally supposed to be Wade Wilson, a.k.a. Deadpool. Weapon IX is later revealed to be project &#x27;Psyche&#x27;, none other than Typhoid Mary.

===Weapon X===

The Weapon X Program experimented on mutants, most notably Wolverine. Later, however, the Weapon X Program branched off into other fields, employing and/or experimenting on a number of test subjects such as Sabretooth. Eventually the program was shut down and became a part of the Canadian government known as Department K. Deadpool, who was a Weapon X reject, was created by Department K. The Facility, a civilian project with connections to the military Weapon X program, would eventually create X-23, a female clone of Wolverine created using genetic material salvaged from the original project.

===Weapon XI===
No character under the official title of Weapon XI has been revealed. However; according to artist Rob Liefeld, Weapon XI was originally intended to be Garrison Kane, who went on to be better known as simply Kane, or confusingly Weapon X.

===Weapon XII===
Weapon Plus created Weapon XII (a.k.a. Huntsman, real name Zona Cluster 6) at the England-based facilities of &quot;The World&quot;. He was the first living weapon created employing artificial evolution and nanosentinel technology. Weapon XII was &quot;accidentally&quot; unleashed on the Channel Tunnel and fought X-Corporation members Cannonball, M, Darkstar, Rictor, Siryn and Multiple Man. Weapon XII was eliminated by Fantomex with the aid of Jean Grey and Professor X, but at the cost of Darkstar&#x27;s life. Huntsman was created to be part of the &quot;Super-Sentinels&quot;, a mutant-hunting team of superheroes with a base in a Weapon Plus space station. This team, a brainchild of John Sublime, was intended to be a publicity stunt to make the genocide of mutants much more acceptable to the public.

===Weapon XIII===
Weapon Plus created Weapon XIII, also known as Fantomex, at The World. However, Fantomex rebelled against his creators. As in the case of Weapon XII, Fantomex&#x27;s powers derive from Nanosentinel technology.

===Weapon XIV===
In &quot;New X-Men&quot; #154 (May 2004), Grant Morrison&#x27;s last issue of &quot;New X-Men&quot;, the telepathic quintuplets called the Stepford Cuckoos were identified as Weapon XIV.
The Stepford Cuckoos&#x27; link to Weapon Plus has finally been addressed in the &quot;Phoenix: Warsong&quot; miniseries, written by Greg Pak, which explores unresolved storylines from Morrison&#x27;s &quot;New X-Men&quot; and Pak&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix: Endsong&quot;.

===Weapon XV===
Weapon XV, a.k.a. Ultimaton, was designed to be the Super-Sentinels&#x27; grand powerhouse. He was killed after Wolverine destroyed the Weapon Plus space station that was designed as the Super-Sentinels HQ.

Ultimaton was recently resurrected in The World and tasked by Fantomex with guarding a hidden chamber which held a child Apocalypse clone created from a blood sample taken from the one previously executed on the Celestial Ship.

===Weapon XVI===
Weapon XVI, a.k.a. Allgod, is a &quot;living religion&quot;, a virus that &quot;attacks the faith reserves&quot;. People infected by Allgod worship the World, and become fanatically devoted slaves to it. Wolverine, Fantomex, and Noh-Varr team up to shut down the World (which has now become sentient), its weapons production, and Allgod along with it.

===Weapon Infinity===
Weapon Infinity, also known as Project: Deathlok, is the cyborg conversion of both ordinary citizens and then all superheroes in the future. The first steps were the reanimation of military corpses, then the wholesale conversion of dead bodies into &quot;Deathloks&quot;, modelled after the hero of the same name. The Deathloks were then used to hunt down and convert all heroes of the future. Project: Deathlok was first seen in Dark Reign: The List: Wolverine, and later fleshed out in the final arc of Wolverine: Weapon X. &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; has since elaborated on the project, revealing it to be Weapon Infinity during the &#x27;Deathlok Nation&#x27; arc.

===Weapon Minus===
A number of scientists were funded by S.H.I.E.L.D to counteract the Weapon Plus program in case it went rogue. In what was explicitly labelled the Weapon Minus program, one of these scientists, when his branch of the project had his funding and materials cut, was forced to test the resultant mixture of Super-Soldier Serum and LSD on himself, the result was named Doctor Mindbubble, who had the psychic ability to create miniature mind-universes that could trap almost anyone. He was intended to counter Weapon VII.

===Project: Troubleshooter===
This program used already existing substances in order to create a new super-soldier. They used the Gamma radiation, Beast&#x27;s Mutant Growth Hormone, Pym Particles and the Lizard formula which resulted in U.S. Army Corporal Todd Ziller becoming American Kaiju.

===Weapon H===
An offshoot of the Weapon X program, Weapon H was created by Reverend William Stryker and Dr. Aliana Alba of the Batch-H division as mutant-hunting cyborg infused with the DNA of the Hulk and Wolverine and subjected to the same adamantium-bonding process as Weapon X and injected with the reverse-engineered versions of Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s nanites as well as the injection of the DNA samples that belonged to Domino, Lady Deathstrike, Sabretooth, and Warpath. Weapon H (then named H-Alpha) proved to be superior to H-Beta who Weapon H killed. 

===Project Hellfire===
During the &quot;Ghost Rider/Wolverine: Weapons of Vengeance&quot; crossover event, the occultist Father Pike led Project Hellfire to bond the demon Bagra-ghul onto the recaptured Wolverine, turning him into Hellverine and controlling him into hunting down other mutants. However, Hellverine resists his programming and kills Pike while Ghost Rider exorcises Bagra-ghul from Wolverine and seals him in stone. 

Project Hellfire is taken over by General Harms, who changes the Program to convert five deceased soldiers as undead cyborgs known as the Destroyers by resurrecting them with hellfire. However, the Destroyers reject their programming and rampage throughout Washington, D.C.. The Destoyers&#x27; activities catch the attention of the recently escaped and reformed Bagra-ghul, who is now possessing Wolverine&#x27;s son Akihiro as the new Hellverine, engaging in a massive conflict that kills most of the Destroyers. The Destroyers&#x27; former commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Leon Townsend, volunteers himself to turned into a similar super soldier by Project Hellfire so that he can stop his former team. After Townsend is converted, he tracks down the last surviving Destroyer, Corporal Jamie Doeden, and helps him regain his humanity. Townsend and Doeden help Hellverine and Wolverine kill the demonic empowered Harms, putting an end to Project Hellfire&#x27;s plans. To prevent Project Hellfire from going rogue again, Hellverine leaves it under the care of the Destroyers and its sympathetic head researcher Dr. Spivey.

==The World==
The World is a secret lab owned by the Weapon Plus Project, in which the program scientists intend to create superior humans employing eugenics, nanotechnology and artificial evolution technology (time is &quot;artificial&quot; at the World and it can be frozen or altered in any way the Program Scientists desire). The artificial time technology employed by Weapon Plus was stolen from A.I.M. A low level of gamma radiation is constantly present to produce mutations in the population.

The human DNA of the inhabitants&#x27; ancestors in this artificial environment was spliced with sentinel microtechnology, meaning they are no longer humans in the traditional meaning of the word, as they have evolved into a race of mutated and naturally born cyborgs refined through eugenics.

Because the scientists have absolute control over the time inside The World (according to Fantomex the time is &quot;liquid&quot;), both freezing it and speeding it up so that decades and centuries can pass within it while time runs normally in the real world, this opens up for new possibilities within the areas of eugenics and genetic engineering. The most promising individuals in each generation are selected while the others are terminated. Also natural selection in the form of the survival of the fittest is possible by exposing the population to different forms of selective pressure. This way, new breeds of superhumans can be evolved within a few months, instead of hundreds or thousands of years. Half a million years inside The World represents only eighteen months on the outside.

The World&#x27;s facilities contains a population (with its own religion, history and culture) that is led to believe that beyond the World&#x27;s limits there&#x27;s nothing, other than endless rock and mutants who are coming to destroy them. Those who are selected for termination believe there is a reward awaiting them at the other side. The World is also filled with numerous experiments and prototypes of Weapon Plus, such as techno-organic human-animal car-cops.

The World was partially destroyed when agents of AIM attacked the facilities in order to recover the technology Weapon Plus stole from them. They are soon killed by Weapon XV.

After years of being uninhabited the World itself, still operational though abandoned, has itself became sentient, and is continuing to make super advanced Weapons. Wolverine and Noh-Varr head to the World to try and stop Norman Osborn from claiming it and its creations as part of H.A.M.M.E.R. While there they are attacked by a large army of mutant zombies, soon revealed to be infected by Weapon XVI, &quot;Allgod&quot;. Noh-Varr is rescued by Fantomex, who is there to retrieve the World&#x27;s brain to help reprogram it into becoming a more benevolent and peaceful being. The two make their way to the World&#x27;s brain, where they are confronted by the Allgod zombies, which now include Wolverine. Noh-Varr is able to disarm Allgod by kissing the World&#x27;s brain, showing it some compassion. Immediately after this, Osborn&#x27;s agent, a remote controlled robot zombie, plunges its fist into the World&#x27;s brain, removing part of the brain, only for Wolverine to slice the robot zombie&#x27;s arm off. Fantomex then uses a shrink-ray he stole from Doctor Doom to shrink the brain, and he takes the brain for his own currently unrevealed purposes.

==In other media==
===Film===
* In the films &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;X2&quot;, flashbacks show Wolverine has participated in the Weapon X program run by William Stryker, but has no memory of it. The Weapon X facility is revealed to be in Alkali Lake, Alberta. It is destroyed when the dam fails. Jean Grey holds back the water allowing the X-Men to escape, but is killed in the process. In &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, Alkali is revisited by Scott Summers who is telekinetically drawn to Alkali. He sees the reborn Jean who inadvertently kills him. Logan and Storm are sent to Alkali Lake to investigate, where they find Jean as Phoenix.
* In the 2008 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, General Ross can be seen extracting an experimental super-soldier serum created by Dr. Reinstein from a cold storage lab where the containers are marked &quot;Weapons Plus&quot;.
* After the success of the three &quot;X-Men&quot; films, the studio produced a spin-off film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;. This film explains and expands on the origins of Logan, including his time at the Weapon X facility. It explains that Weapon X is the tenth weapon created by the lab. Each weapon is a living mutant enhanced by technological means. Weapon X (Wolverine) is given adamantium bones to increase his durability. Weapon XI was portrayed in the film as a genetically altered Wade Wilson played by both Scott Adkins and Ryan Reynolds. Weapon XI is also referred to by Col. William Stryker as &quot;Deadpool&quot;, due to having powers &quot;pooled&quot; from many other mutants killed and/or kidnapped in the film, including Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor, Cyclops&#x27; optic blasts, Wraith&#x27;s teleportation ability, and Chris Bradley&#x27;s technopathy. He also has retractable blades extending from his arms. Weapon XI is the final antagonist of the film, having been genetically altered to be the ultimate mutant killer. His head is cut off by Wolverine while his back is turned battling Sabretooth. In a post-credits scene, his body looks for and finds his head in the rubble, which returns to life.
* Project Rebirth (Weapon I) appears in the 2011 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;. Rebirth is a Strategic Scientific Reserve project to create a new line of Super Soldiers for its World War II effort against the Red Skull and his division. It began with a collaboration between U.S., British and German scientists led by Dr. Abraham Erskine and under the supervision of Peggy Carter, Howard Stark and Chester Phillips.
* Alkali Lake is featured again in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;, run again by Stryker. In 1983, he captured members of the X-Men, because they were suspects behind sudden nuclear launches into space by the ancient mutant Apocalypse. However, Jean, Scott and Kurt, who infiltrated the base, released an imprisoned Weapon X upon the base, and he tore through the base&#x27;s security and escaped. The X-Men were freed by Scott and used a jet in the hangar to escape, while later he was mugged by Essex Corporation to reclaim what was left of the Weapon X Program.

===Novels===
* In the non-canonical novel &quot;Wolverine: Violent Tendencies&quot;, Weapon 0 is referred to as &quot;Weapon Null&quot;, and is an early and dismissed branch of a super-soldier program completely different from the Weapon Plus program of the comics. Weapon Null was focused on the utilisation of bio-enhancement to upgrade soldiers into organic self-contained weapons; the grotesque creations require extensive and expensive maintenance and transportation conditions, so the program was shelved. During the course of the novel, Wolverine encounters four of Weapon Null&#x27;s more successful creations: &quot;Slammer&quot;, &quot;Blowtorch&quot;, &quot;Cypher&quot; and &quot;Bipolar&quot;.

<text>The Drury Lane Theatres were a group of five theatres in the Chicago metropolitan area founded by Tony DeSantis. The playhouses were named after the historic Theatre Royal Drury Lane, built in London in the 17th century. The five locations all provided affordable dinner theatre that was appropriate for families. Two have since closed, two others were later sold and operate under new names, and one still operated as a Drury Lane Theatre.

DeSantis opened the &quot;Martinique Restaurant&quot; in Evergreen Park and began producing plays in 1949 in a tent adjacent to the restaurant to attract customers. The enterprise was successful, prompting him to build his first theatre. 
*&quot;Drury Lane Evergreen Park&quot; was DeSantis&#x27;s first theatre in the Chicago area. It opened in 1958 and was a local entertainment landmark for 45 years before closing in 2003.
* &quot;Drury Lane Oakbrook Terrace&quot; opened in 1984, and is located at the intersection of Kingery Highway, Butterfield Road, and Illinois Route 38 (Roosevelt Road) in Oakbrook Terrace. It continues to present an annual season of five shows.
*The original Drury Lane Water Tower Place opened in 1976, but closed in 1983. A new, $7 million version opened on May 18, 2004. In 2010, this was taken over by the Nederlander Organization-owned Broadway In Chicago production company and renamed the Broadway Playhouse at Water Tower Place.
*&quot;Drury Lane North&quot; began operations in 1976, but was soon sold to the &quot;Marriott Lincolnshire Resort&quot; and became the Marriott Theatre.
*&quot;Drury Lane East&quot; (at McCormick Place) also opened in the 1970s, but failed within a year of its opening.

<doc id="713152" wikidata="Q1501567" url="?curid=713152" title="Imari ware">
<text>is a Western term for a brightly-coloured style of Japanese export porcelain made in the area of Arita, in the former Hizen Province, northwestern Kyūshū. They were exported to Europe in large quantities, especially between the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century. 

Typically Imari ware (in the English use of the term) is decorated in underglaze blue, with red, gold, black for outlines, and sometimes other colours, added in overglaze. In the most characteristic floral designs most of the surface is coloured, with &quot;a tendency to overdecoration that leads to fussiness&quot;. The style was so successful that Chinese and European producers began to copy it. Sometimes the different overglaze styles of Kakiemon and Kutani ware are also grouped under Imari ware.

The name derives from the port of Imari, Saga, from which they were shipped to Nagasaki, where the Dutch East India Company and the Chinese had trading outposts. In the West the multi-coloured or &quot;enamelled&quot; wares became known as &quot;Imari ware&quot;, and a different group kakiemon, while blue and white wares were called &quot;Arita ware&quot;; in fact the types were often produced at the same kilns. Today, the use of &quot;Imari&quot; as a descriptor has declined, and they are often called Arita wares (or Hizen wares, after the old province). Imari ware was copied in both China and Europe, and has been continuously produced to the present day.
&quot;Early Imari&quot; (&quot;shoki imari&quot;) is a traditional and somewhat confusing term used for very different wares that were made around Arita before about 1650. The porcelains are generally small and sparsely painted in underglaze blue for the domestic market, but there are also some large green celadon dishes, apparently made for the southeast Asian market, in a porcellaneous stoneware.

==History==
&quot;Imari&quot; was simply the trans-shipment port for Arita wares, from where they went to the foreign trading outposts at Nagasaki. It was the kilns at Arita which formed the heart of the Japanese porcelain industry. 

Arita&#x27;s kilns were set up in the 17th century, after kaolin was discovered in 1616 by immigrant Korean potter, Yi Sam-pyeong (1579–1655). After the discovery, some kilns began to produce revised Korean-style blue and white porcelains, known as Early Imari, or &quot;Shoki-Imari&quot;. 

In the mid-17th century there were also many Chinese refugees in northern Kyushu due to the turmoil in China, and it is said that one of them brought the overglaze enamel coloring technique to Arita. Thus Shoki-Imari developed into Ko-Kutani, Imari, and later Kakiemon, which are sometimes taken as a wider group of Imari wares. Ko-Kutani was produced around 1650 for both export and domestic market. Kutani ware is characterized by vivid green, blue, purple, yellow and red colors in bold designs of landscapes and nature. Blue and white porcelain pieces continued to be produced and they are called Ai-Kutani. Ko-Kutani Imari for the export market usually adopted Chinese design structure such as kraak style, whereas Ai-Kutani for the domestic market were highly unique in design and are accordingly valued very much among collectors.

Ko-Kutani style evolved into Kakiemon-style Imari, which was produced for about 50 years around 1700. Kakiemon was characterized by crisp lines, and bright blue, red and green designs of dramatically stylized floral and bird scenes. Imari achieved its technical and aesthetic peak in the Kakiemon style, and it dominated the European market. Blue and white Kakiemon is called Ai-Kakiemon. The Kakiemon style transformed into Kinrande in the 18th century, using underglaze blue and overglaze red and gold enamels, and later additional colors. 

Imari began to be exported to Europe when the Chinese kilns at Jingdezhen were damaged in the political chaos and the new Qing dynasty government halted trade in 1656–1684. Exports to Europe were made through the Dutch East India Company, and in Europe the designation &quot;Imari porcelain&quot; connotes Arita wares of mostly Kinrande Imari. 

Export of Imari to Europe stopped in mid-18th century when China resumed export to Europe, since Imari was not able to compete against Chinese products due to high labor costs. By that time, however, both Imari and Kakiemon styles were already so popular among Europeans that the Chinese export porcelain copied both, a type known as Chinese Imari. At the same time, European kilns, such as Meissen and English potteries such as Johnson Bros. and (Royal) Crown Derby, also imitated the Imari and Kakiemon styles. 

Export of Imari surged again in late 19th century (Meiji era) when Japonism flourished in Europe. Thus in the western world today, two kinds of true Japanese Imari can be found: that exported in the mid-Edo period, and that exported in the Meiji era. From the viewpoint of collectors, these two types are completely different, though Kinrande appearances are similar.

==Characteristics==
Though there are many types of Imari ware, the type usually so called in the West is called &quot;kinrande&quot; in Japanese, and was produced for export in large quantities from the mid-17th century until the export trade tailed off around 1740. &quot;Kinrande&quot; has underglaze cobalt blue and overglaze red and gold, and sometimes other colors. The color combination was not seen in China at that time. Traditional Ming dynasty color porcelain used dominantly red and green, probably due to scarcity of gold in China, whereas gold was abundant in Japan in those days. 

The subject matter of Arita is diverse, ranging from foliage and flowers to people, scenery and abstractions. Some designs such as Kraak porcelain were adopted from China, but most designs were uniquely Japanese owing to the rich Japanese tradition of paintings and costume design. The porcelain has a gritty texture on the base, where it is not covered by glaze. 

=== Chinese Imari ===

Though sophisticated wares in authentic Japanese styles were being made at Arita for the fastidious home market, European–style designations of Arita porcelain were formed after blue and white kraak porcelains, imitating Chinese underglaze &quot;blue-and-white&quot; wares, or made use of enamel colors over underglazes of cobalt blue and iron red. The ware often used copious gilding, sometimes with spare isolated sprigged vignettes, but often densely patterned in compartments. There were two quite different styles in these wares. Globular Imari teapots with swan-necked spouts helped establish the classic European form for these new necessities of life.

Dutch traders had a monopoly on the insatiable export trade, the first large order being placed at Arita by the Dutch East India Company in 1656. The trade peaked in the late 17th century and was slowly replaced by Chinese kilns in the early 18th century; it ended in 1756, as social conditions in China settled with the full establishment of the Qing Dynasty. Imitating Arita designs, fine &quot;Chinese Imari&quot; export wares were produced in the 18th century, eclipsing the original Japanese exports.

=== European Imari ===

European centers imitated the style of Imari wares, initially in faience at Delft in the Netherlands. Imari patterns, as well as &quot;Kakiemon&quot; designs and palette of colors, influenced some early Orientalizing wares produced by the porcelain manufactories at Meissen, Chantilly, or later at Vincennes and in Vienna. It was also produced in the early 19th century at Robert Chamberlain&#x27;s Worcester porcelain factory at Worcester, as well as Crown Derby porcelain, where Imari patterns remain popular to the present.

<text>David John Morris (born 19 March 1957) is a British author of gamebooks, novels and comics and a designer of computer games and role-playing games.

==Education==
Dave Morris graduated from Magdalen College, Oxford, where he read Physics from 1976 until 1979.

==Writer==
Morris began his writing career in 1984 by writing the fantasy adventure gamebook &quot;Crypt of the Vampire&quot;, part of the &quot;Golden Dragon&quot; series published by Grafton Books in the UK and Berkley Books in the US. 

The following year, Morris and Oliver Johnson created the &quot;Dragon Warriors&quot; role-playing game. &quot;Dragon Warriors&quot; was an attempt at releasing a role-playing game in a series of paperback books. In a 1996 reader poll conducted by &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the fifty most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Dragon Warriors&quot; was ranked 48th. In 2008, the game was licensed by Morris to James Wallis of Magnum Opus Press, and Serpent King Games acquired the &quot;Dragon Warriors&quot; license afterwards.

In 1987, Morris and Johnson created the &quot;Blood Sword&quot; series, five adventure gamebooks published by Knight Books.

In 1990, Morris and Jamie Thomson wrote &quot;The Keep of the Lich-Lord&quot; for the popular &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; series of adventure gamebooks.

==&quot;Fabled Lands&quot;==
In 1995, Morris and Jamie Thomson wrote the first of several adventure gamebooks in the &quot;Fabled Lands&quot; series. It received positive reviews, including 20 years later. 

Although well-received, the books were published when, as Sylvio Konkol noted, &quot;the golden age of adventure gamebooks was actually over.&quot; Morris and Thomson originally envisioned twelve books in the series, but various publishing problems, including underpricing the expensive books and a shrinking market, meant the series was curtailed after only six volumes. 

As Massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) became popular in the early 2000s, Morris and Thomson hired the French firm Eidos to convert their books into an MMO. However, Eidos ran out of money before the project was completed. 

Twenty-five years after the &quot;Fabled Lands&quot; books were published, Morris and Thomson granted a license to Prime Games to develop a &quot;Fabled Lands&quot; computer role-playing game.

==Other works==
Morris also co-authored a number of other books, including &quot;Virtual Reality: Necklace of Skulls&quot; with Mark Smith (1993), &quot;Blood Sword: The Battlepits of Krarth&quot; with Oliver Johnson (1987), the &quot;Golden Dragon&quot; series, and a number of TV and movie novelisations.

His original novels include &quot;Knightmare&quot; (a historical fantasy adventure series set in the early 13th century that ties in with the television series of that name), &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and the contemporary horror novel &quot;Lost Souls&quot;. Another horror novel, &quot;Florien&quot;, was published as an ebook in 2010. In 2008 his episodic comic strip &quot;Mirabilis&quot; began weekly publication in Random House&#x27;s subscription-based magazine The DFC. Working with artist Leo Hartas, Morris founded electronic publisher Mirus Entertainment and published &quot;Mirabilis&quot; for the iPad in December 2010.

In addition to his more than seventy published books, Morris is a leading developer of the &quot;Empire of the Petal Throne&quot; gaming system (created by MAR Barker and published by TSR), creating a playable rules system (&quot;Tirikelu&quot;) and editing a fanzine.

Morris also co-authored a book on the computer gaming industry, having worked as a game designer for Eidos and Microsoft, and is a former mentor in the American Film Institute&#x27;s Digital Content Lab. In April 2012, he published an interactive reworking of Frankenstein in which the reader is able to give advice to the first-person narrator of the story.

<text>The Order is the name of two fictional superhero teams appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first team was a brief offshoot of the team Defenders, and the second is part of an initiative to place a superhero team in each state of the United States.

==Publication history==
===Defenders offshoot===
The original incarnation of The Order starred in the six-issue limited series &quot;The Order&quot; (April–Sept. 2002) intending to conquer the world to protect it. The team consisted of the original Defenders: Doctor Strange, The Incredible Hulk, Namor the Sub-Mariner and Silver Surfer.

===Initiative version===
A second Marvel Comics superhero team called The Order debuted in &quot;The Order&quot; vol. 2, No. 1 (Sept. 2007), created by writer Matt Fraction and penciler Barry Kitson. Following the fallout of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover event, The Order was dubbed the &quot;First Super Hero Team of Tomorrow&quot;, being the official superhero team for California as part of the . (The group was originally intended to be named The Champions before it was revealed that the &quot;Champions&quot; trademark was then owned by Heroic Publishing.) The group was first seen during the end of the &quot;Civil War,&quot; with many of its members going unnamed during their first appearances. Most of them, however, would be a part of the new series, though the designs of the characters were slightly altered.

As the cast of The Order is composed almost entirely of new characters, Fraction looked to a popular television drama for ideas on how to acquaint readers with his protagonists: &quot;I kind of went with the same kind of format they use on &quot;Lost&quot;. Each issue, I wanted readers to spend a little time with one character more than any other.&quot;

Fraction framed each issue around a flashback sequence depicting an interview with each character explaining their past and why they joined the Order to give each character a detailed introduction.

In late January 2008, Fraction revealed on Newsarama&#x27;s podcast &quot;Word Balloon&quot; that &quot;The Order&quot; would end at issue 10. Though at first it was believed that Marvel had canceled the series, Fraction later stated on a later Newsarama interview that:

Though the series was ended several of the book&#x27;s characters and storylines would continue on in Matt Fraction&#x27;s next project, &quot;The Invincible Iron Man&quot;. The group also appeared in the 2008 &quot;Eternals&quot; series and &quot;&quot; No. 18.

==Fictional team history==

===Defenders offshoot===
The original incarnation of The Order starred in the six-issue limited series &quot;The Order&quot; (April–Sept. 2002) intending to conquer the world to protect it. The team consisted of the original Defenders: Doctor Strange, The Incredible Hulk, Namor the Sub-Mariner and Silver Surfer.

Their fellow Defenders Hellcat, Nighthawk, Valkyrie and Clea team up with other heroes (including Ardina, a cosmic-powered woman they mystically create from a portion of the Silver Surfer&#x27;s energy) to oppose the Order and return them to their senses, just in time to prevent the curse from rendering Yandroth omnipotent.

===Initiative version===
The team was largely made up of celebrities known for making a difference through charitable work, and through a process involving a viral genomech payload developed by Hank Pym each one is given superpowers modeled on the pantheon of Greek gods and trained at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Arizona. However, this process causes great strain on human bodies allowing the users limited time as superhuman (roughly a year).

The group, then known as the Champions, were first put to use in the final battle of the superhuman Civil War. Though unnamed, the group that went into the fight consisted of people that closely resembled Hercules, Pierce, Maul, an African-American Avona, Bannerman Brown &amp; Green, Corona along with several others displaying a variety of different powers.

As the Californian Initiative team, slightly changed versions of many the first seen team face and defeat Infernal Man. After the battle, some members failed to follow the morals clause in their contract by going out drinking, and were subsequently fired and had their powers removed. Their replacements, Milo Fields, Mulholland Black, Magdalena Marie, and Becky Ryan, were given different powers.

The team would come into conflict with various villains, most with a connection to General Softly and the mysterious &quot;M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W.&quot; military group, including hordes of Zobos (mechanized zombie hobos), Cold War supervillains, Gamma monsters, Namor, and an all girl gang called the Black Dahlias who have been given superpowers via the same process as The Order by M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W. as well as deal with a murder case involving a former Order member.

The team is later evicted from its Bradbury, California headquarters and the M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W. is revealed to be a collection of General Softly androids first devised by the Super Human Development and Operation (S.H.D.O.), an early attempt at a Fifty State Initiative from fifty years before; around the time of the real General Samuel Softly&#x27;s death, and now part of a collection of villains (including Black Dahlias and Maul) led by Ezekiel Stane, the son of Iron Man enemy Obadiah Stane, who have set out to destroy The Order. After Stane reactivates Mulholland Black&#x27;s powers to the point they went out of control and depowered the rest of The Order, Henry Hellrung was forced to kill Mulholland.

The villains defeated, Tony Stark offers to repower the surviving members of The Order permanently and turn the team into a military operation rather than a public relations showcase. The Order will continue on as the Initiative superhero team of California. During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, The Order was one of the two Initiative teams that the invading Skrulls were unable to place a sleeper agent on as the team was chosen by Tony Stark personally rather than Criti Noll, the Skrull impostor of Hank Pym. However, suspicions arose also among the members of the Order and almost culminated in a fight.

During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, representatives of the Order are called by Prodigy when the Initiative is restarted and briefed on the hammers which the Serpent summoned to Earth.

===Initiative version===

====Current members====
* Anthem – Henry Hellrung is the team&#x27;s field leader and representation of Apollo with the powers of a living supercell thunderstorm; able to stimulate and separate positive and negative charges in the air to generate electricity. Hellrung was an actor who played Tony Stark on a TV series who eventually became good friends with the billionaire himself. During the peak of his fame, Hellrung and Stark were regular fixtures in the celebrity nightlife scene. However Hellrung&#x27;s hard partying eventually turned him into an alcoholic and cost him his job and reputation within the industry. Hellrung joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), recovered, and eventually became well known for his activism within the organization. When Tony Stark himself also became an alcoholic, he joined AA and was sponsored by Hellrung. During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, Norman Osborn has Hellrung placed under arrest.
* Aralune – Rebecca &quot;Becky&quot; Ryan is a former two-time Little Ms. America, multiple time Teenager of the Year, and platinum selling pop star, Ryan now has the ability to shape-shift. Depicted as a pop-starlet akin to Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson, Ryan has faced various troubles in her successful career including bulimia and a sex tape scandal, which was successfully covered up by Kate Kildare. Ryan has been portrayed as a dedicated, hard-worker, but also as a people pleaser to her own detriment. Her powers are designed so she &quot;can be whatever she wants&quot;, becoming a metamorph.
* Calamity – James Wa was an aspiring athlete known for his raw speed, but after a car accident that cost him both his legs he went into an engineering career. Already nicknamed Calamity, Wa designed Calamity-brand Cheetah prosthetic limbs. He is the representation of Hermes and has the power of super speed, reaching foot speeds of Mach 3. The character changed outfits between &quot;Civil War&quot; No. 7 and &quot;The Order&quot; vol. 2, No. 1.
* Supernaut – Sergeant Milo Fields is a former soldier who, along with his platoon, was held hostage for eleven days while serving in the Somali Civil War; four of his men were killed and the rest were abandoned and later found by some Military Police officers on leave. A greatly exaggerated version of the capture and rescue was turned into a Hollywood movie by the U. S. government. Fields, not liking how the government had portrayed his life story, became quite active in the Anti-war movement and was shot in the spine by someone who thought Fields was being unpatriotic, leaving him wheel-chair bound. His neural networks have been hardwired into Stark&#x27;s satellite network. He now pilots an Omega-level mechanized battle-suit, Supernaut, using his neural networks and is considered the team&#x27;s artillery. After mixing his blood together with that of the shape-shifter Aralune, Milo regained the ability to walk.
* Veda – Magdalena &quot;Maggie&quot; Marie Neuntauben was an actress known for her martial arts background and work with orphans; she has the power to summon humanoid golem soldiers out of organic materials that surround her using multisight to see through their eyes.

====Former members====
* Aphrodite – A former supermodel.
* Avona – representation of Athena Avery Allen is a gifted swordswoman, Allen was given a sword with integrated talking AI called &quot;Bluetooth&quot; with which Allen had a psychic link. She was fired and later murdered.
* Bannerman Brown &amp; Bannerman Green – Two Stark Enterprises androids. They were later destroyed by Infernal Man.
* Mulholland Black - Mulholland Black is the orphaned mutant daughter of two dead junkie grunge musicians. Black&#x27;s mutant power enabled her to share a psycho kinetic link with historical events allowing her to convert dormant energies lying just below the surface of Los Angeles into psychokinetic fuel for a variety of effects but after M-Day she lost this ability. While living on the streets, she joined the all-girl gang &quot;Black Dahlias&quot; but was later kicked out after cheating on one of its members. As part of The Order, Mulholland, who opted to not to use a code name, was given a power similar to her former ability, this power gave her a psychokinetic connection to L. A. itself through the people of the city. She also wields a power mallet, charged by her psychokinetic energy, which grants her flight. The &quot;Black Dahlias&quot;, who all gained superpowers, inject Black with Stark&#x27;s S.P.I.N. Tech to remove her powers but somehow allowed her true mutant powers to resurface. Her out of control powers caused riot-based destruction on a massive scale and Henry Hellrung was forced to kill Mulholland to save the city. In the aftermath, her death becomes an important factor in Henry and the rest of the Order reenlisting as a new version of the team with permanent superpowers.

She also changed outfit and hair color between &quot;Civil War&quot; No. 7 and &quot;The Order&quot; vol. 2, No. 1. She was later fired.

<text>Luis Ernesto Salazar Garcia (born May 19, 1956) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player, coach and manager. He played in Major League Baseball from 1980 to 1992 as a third baseman and outfielder for the San Diego Padres (1980–84, 1987, 1989), Chicago White Sox (1985–86), Detroit Tigers (1988), and the Chicago Cubs (1989–92).

==Baseball career==
In 1973, he signed with the Kansas City Royals but was released in 1974. He signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1975. On August 5, 1980, Salazar, along with Rick Lancellotti, was traded to the San Diego Padres for a player to be named later and Kurt Bevacqua. The Padres later sent Mark Lee to Pittsburgh to complete the trade. After seven minors seasons, finally, he got a chance with San Diego in the 1980 season.

An extremely versatile reserve who played every position but catcher in his career, Salazar was the Padres&#x27; third baseman between 1981 and 1983. In 1984, they acquired 39-year-old Graig Nettles, who platooned with Salazar at third base. The Padres won the National League pennant, before losing the World Series in five games to the Detroit Tigers. Salazar was traded to the White Sox along with Ozzie Guillén (1985), and returned to the Padres as a free agent (1987). Then, he signed with Detroit (1988), before being dealt back to San Diego. Salazar finished his career with the Cubs.

In his first stint with the Padres, Salazar hit 29 home runs with 187 runs batted in and 109 stolen bases in 525 games. In 126 games with the White Sox, he played on third base, first base, shortstop and outfield (eventually was DH and relief pitcher), batting .245 with 10 homers and 45 RBI. For Detroit, mostly in the outfield, he hit .270, 12, 62. Also, he kept the Tigers in a pennant race by filling in at shortstop for injured Alan Trammell.

On August 31, 1989, a few minutes before the postseason rosters must be filed, the Cubs obtained Salazar from San Diego in a last effort to replace their four slumping third basemen. Salazar gave the club a lift in September, playing a solid third base and batting .325 (26-80) with 12 RBI and a .357 on-base percentage. The Cubs won the National League East division title. The next three seasons Salazar played predominantly on third base, batting .243 with 31 homers, 110 RBI, and 78 runs in 316 games.

In a 1,302-game career, Salazar batted .261 with 179 home runs, 653 RBI, 438 runs scored, 1070 hits, 144 doubles, 33 triples and 117 stolen bases. Salazar was also a valuable pinch-hitter in his career. He went 28-for-91 for a .308 of batting average, with four home runs and 17 runs batted in.

He has served as a hitting coach with the Louisville RiverBats (1999), Indianapolis Indians (2000), Milwaukee Brewers, Jacksonville Suns (2008) and Chattanooga Lookouts (2009).

Salazar was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010.

Salazar joined the Atlanta Braves organization in 2011 and was poised to serve as the manager of their Class A-Advanced minor league affiliate, the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League. On March 9, 2011, he was struck in the face by a foul ball hit by Braves catcher Brian McCann during a spring training game between the Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals. He was airlifted to a local hospital to undergo surgery. Salazar had his left eye removed on March 15, 2011, due to the injuries he sustained from the incident. After the injury, Salazar stated that he intended to continue working for the Braves organization, and he was expected to return to manage the Hillcats once medically cleared to return to work. Salazar returned to the Hillcats dugout on April 15, 2011.

Salazar was named manager for the A advanced Florida Fire Frogs in the Atlanta Braves organization for the 2018 season.

<text>Wildwater canoeing is a competitive discipline of canoeing in which kayaks or canoes are used to negotiate a stretch of river speedily. It is also called &quot;Whitewater racing&quot; or &quot;Downriver racing&quot; to distinguish it from whitewater slalom racing and whitewater rodeo or Freestyle competition.
==General==
The objective of the sport is to go from the starting point of the course on a river to the end point as quickly as possible. Typical wildwater venues consist of Class II - IV whitewater, in contrast to extreme racing, which takes place on more difficult streams. Match competitions generally consist of a classic and a sprint race. A classic course is 4 to 6 miles (6–10 km) in length or 10 to 35 minutes in duration, while the Sprint is between 500 and 750 meters and lasts around 2 minutes. Although there is some specialization, the vast majority of racers compete in both classic and sprint.

Competitors are placed in classes based on gender and boat type as follows:
*K1 – solo kayak, male
*K1W – solo kayak, female
*C1 – solo canoe, male
*C1W – solo canoe, female
*C2 – tandem canoe.
The competitors are numbered within their class based on results from previous races and compete in reverse order (best paddler last), usually at one-minute intervals. To race successfully, paddlers must possess refined technical skill, as well as strength, endurance, aerobic capacity, and the ability to &quot;read&quot; whitewater.

Whitewater racing is also practiced by competing teams; each team is made by a group of three competitors belonging to the same class.

Whitewater racing started in Europe with the International Canoe Federation being formed and having the first World Championships in Switzerland in 1949. Since then, there has been a World Championships every two years. Since 2011 there is a sprint only world championships, with sprint and classic being contested every other (even) year.

==Boat design ==
* Wildwater solo kayaks (K1) are 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in) long and 60 cm (23.6 in) wide;
* Wildwater solo canoes (C-1) are 4.3 m (14 ft 1 in) long and 70 cm (27.5 in) wide;
* Wildwater tandem canoes (C-2) are 5 m (16 ft 5 in) long and 80 cm (31.5 in) wide.

The boats all have a rounded hull profile, making them fast but unstable and hard to turn. Rather than using wide sweep strokes to turn the boat, the paddler tilts the boat to one side, utilizing its curved profile to effect the turn in a manner similar to &quot;carving a turn&quot; in skiing. Two &quot;wings&quot; (flaring protrusions near the stern hull) meet the minimum width required by racing rules and add secondary stability, as well as enhancing the effect of carving a turn. When the boat is under way, most of each wing will be above the waterline so as to minimize drag. The use of kevlar, carbon fiber, and glass-reinforced plastic construction has substantially reduced the weight of wildwater boats, while improving stiffness. The top part (the deck) and the bottom (the hull) are molded separately and then bonded together using kevlar or glass cloth strips and epoxy or polyester resin. A boat can be made in 2 to 3 days, but without an oven can take weeks to cure fully.

Before glass-reinforced plastic boats, the common racing craft was the folding kayak, usually composed of a wooden frame covered with canvas.

Competitors are also required to wear an appropriate whitewater helmet and PFD and River shoes or booties and flotation bags for their boats.

==Training and racing==
Racers paddle down a course along the fastest jets of water. In order to go fast, they follow the edges of wave trains and hold as straight a line as possible down the river. If it is unclear which line is fastest, two paddlers simultaneously float the different options and see which boat moves ahead. Because of the high speeds, racers frequently run a river two or three times a day when training for a race.

Some racers practice on rivers if they are lucky to live near one. Usually they will paddle 5–10 miles a day, five to six days a week. Others practice on lakes or flatwater rivers. In northern areas rivers and lakes freeze, so racers sometimes train in an indoor pool, lift weights, run or do Cross-country skiing. When the rivers and lakes become free of ice then training is resumed outdoors.

==Rivers==
Popular whitewater racing courses in Scotland include Grandtully and Stanley on the River Tay. Whitewater racing courses in England include the Washburn and the Tees. Popular whitewater racing courses in Wales include the Tryweryn, and the Dee. 
In the United States, races take place throughout the Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and Western states; rivers there include the Nantahala and Pigeon in North Carolina and the Ocoee in Tennessee. There are also well-attended annual races on West Virginia&#x27;s Cheat and Gauley rivers, Maryland&#x27;s Potomac and Youghiogheny (&quot;Yough&quot;) rivers, as well as on Colorado&#x27;s Arkansas for the annual Fibark Festival which has the oldest continually run downriver/wildwater race in the USA.

Rivers in Europe that have held international races include the Isère in Bourg St Maurice, France, the Loisach in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, the Liffey in Ireland and the Teplá in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic.
In South Africa races take place on the Trichardt Spruit, Umkomaas River, Bushmans River and As River. The As River forms part of a water exchange program between South Africa and Lesotho and is fed via a tunnel from the Katse Dam.

The 2004 World Wildwater Championships were held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The 2006 Championships were held from 12–17 June on the Teplá River, in the Czech Republic. The K1 men&#x27;s sprint race was won by Max Hoff of Germany; the K1 men&#x27;s classic was won by Kamil Mruzek of the Czech Republic. The 2008 World Championships will take place from 5–8 June in Ivrea, Italy.

<text>&quot;Dreams Die Hard&quot; is an autobiographical book published in 1982 and re-issued in 1993 by David Harris, a prominent anti-Vietnam War activist during the 1960s.

The book chronicles the experiences of three men (Harris, Allard Lowenstein, and Dennis Sweeney) amid the political and social tumult of the 1960s, as well as the aftermath of these experiences. Specifically, paranoid schizophrenia and two decades of accumulated disillusionment and homophobia eventually led a deranged Sweeney to murder Lowenstein.

One-term Congressman Lowenstein, &quot;the world&#x27;s oldest student activist,&quot; had, by his forties, lived decades in various political arenas. From the Mississippi Freedom Summer project in the Deep South, to the Dump Johnson campaign of 1968, Allard was passionate and well-connected in liberal circles. He was most likely bisexual before the word was current.

Harris&#x27;s detailed and historical narration, written in an attempt to explain the lives of each of the characters, discusses how the three activists began their affiliations at Stanford University, and continued through the turbulent decade.

Lowenstein&#x27;s sexual orientation reappears throughout the book and serves as one of many connections between the three main figures: both Harris and Sweeney rejected overt passes from Lowenstein; Harris&#x27;s reaction was thoughtful, empathetic, and verbal; but Sweeney&#x27;s reaction was decidedly irrational and physical and ended in murder.

&quot;Dreams Die Hard&quot; was adapted into a two-act play of the same name by John Binder which was first produced at the Met Theater in Hollywood in 1995.

<text>Amazonas () is a department and region in northern Peru bordered by Ecuador on the north and west, Cajamarca on the west, La Libertad on the south, and Loreto and San Martín on the east. Its capital is the city of Chachapoyas.

With a landscape of steep river gorges and mountains, Amazonas is the location of Kuelap, a huge stone fortress enclosing more than 400 stone structures; it was built on a mountain about 3,000 meters high, starting about 500 AD and was occupied to the mid-16th century. It is one of Peru&#x27;s major archeological sites.

==Geography==
The department of Amazonas consists of regions covered by rainforests and mountain ranges. The rainforest zone predominates (72.93%) and it extends to the north over its oriental slope, up to the border with Ecuador in the summits of the Cordillera del Cóndor. The mountain range zone is located in the southern provinces of the Amazonas Region and it only includes 27.07% of its whole territorial surface.

One of the factors that help to give big importance to its geography is not only that the big valleys and plains of its rainforest zone are the closest to the Pacific Ocean, but also its connections with the routes of the coast are the lowest. This is because they use the Paso de Porculla (the mountain pass of Porculla) that is located at 2,144 m. This is the lowest pass of the whole Peruvian Andes to arrive to the Pan-American road system.

The vast and deep Marañón valley which constitutes one of the most important morphologic features of the region.

The Marañón valley crosses a big part of its territory and expands itself from south to north. It reaches its greatest width in the province of Bagua. It narrows when it crosses the Cordillera Oriental (Spanish for &quot;eastern mountain range&quot;) in its most violent route towards the east, towards the lowest part of the Amazon. It crosses canyons and natural porches called &quot;punkus&quot;, a Quechua word that means doors.

The Utkupampa valley which is the real axis of the department of Amazonas is located between 5° and 6° of south latitude and 78° and 79° of west longitude. It is longitudinally developed up to the Marañón River, in which it flowed at 400 m.

This zone is the principal center of production and human groups location. It is developed in four very pronounced sectors:

* Vertiente del Marañon (Marañon&#x27;s spring), that has important quebradas (Seca, Bocana, Copallín Nuevo and Choloque).
* Valle Medio (the middle valley) that has eleven quebradas in its both borders.
* Valle Alto (the high valley) that has seven quebradas. The most important one is Magunchal.
* Planicie de Bagua (the Bagua&#x27;s plain), wavy and picturesque, that is located at 550 m. In some places, it mounts up to 900 m., for example in the inhabited point called La Peca.

The principal tributaries of the Utkupampa are the Chiriaco, the Nieva, the Santiago (that is born in Ecuador) and the Cenepa, that is born in the north zone of the Cordillera del Cóndor. The Cenepa River receives in its trip numerous tributaries like the Comaina. It flowed in the Marañon river, located near Orellana (Condorcanqui Province).

===Route to Huallaga Central: Plain of Bagua===
The Utkupampa valley which is born in the high &quot;jalcas&quot; of the Chachapoyas Province and which runs from southeast to northwest to mix with the waters of the Marañón River, forms the immense plain of Bagua. This plain has a warm climate, which temperature can reach a maximum of 40 °C, being the minimum one 21 °C.

Like in the whole high jungle region of Peru –head of mountain-, its water regimen is irregular and sometimes without rains.

Some of the important places inside this route are the touristic corridor of the Utkupampa and the lake Pumaqucha.

==History==
Some excavation of archaeological sites covered over by the rain forest have attested to the presence of humans in the area since ancient times. Most of the Pre-Hispanic cultures that became prosperous in the area are still a mystery due to the lack of research. Deep in the interior, Kuélap&#x27;s Fortress is an ancient walled city and archeological site in the mountains. The largest stone complex in South America, it is located 3,000 meters above sea level, higher than the site of Machu Picchu. It is located above the Amazon River, where it bends before entering the broad lowland basin. A huge construction of military architecture, Kuélap&#x27;s Fortress includes the ruins of some 450 houses.

The Chachapoyas culture developed during the Inca age; these people strongly opposed the Incan conquest and repelled the first Inca attempts to incorporate the region to their empire in the 15th century.

The Spanish colonial region&#x27;s capital, Chachapoyas, was founded in 1538 by Alonso de Alvarado. During the same year, its first church was built. Later the Santa Ana, San Lázaro and Señor de Burgos churches were built. In April 1821, the city&#x27;s inhabitants expelled the Spaniards and ignored their rule, following the steps taken by the San Martín liberating army as Peru gained independence from Spain.

The area of the Amazonas Region was strongly linked to the movement for independence. The cleric Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza was its most outstanding representative, encouraging the patriots of this era and signing the National Act of Independence.

The Cordillera del Condor, located in this region, was the scene of the border war between Peru and Ecuador in 1981.

===European conquest===
The natives of the region received in a jubilant and cordial way the first Spanish who came into Amazonas. They knew about their arrival in Peru by the news that they had received from Cajamarca.

Those people had told Francisco Pizarro that Chachapoyas was an excellent agricultural region where the people possessed a lot of gold and silver. The conquistador did not lose time and formed an expedition of 20 men, putting captain Alonso de Alvarado in charge of it, with the express order to found a Christian city at Chachapoyas.

The chroniclers say that, when the Spanish arrived to the region, the Chachapoyas people gave big parties in their honor and gave them many rich gifts willingly, also numerous examples of appreciation, including showing some interest to become Christians.

Pizarro decided to send a second expedition, this time with instructions to take possession of the zone, delivering Alvarado a provision so he would be able to found the city of San Juan de la Frontera de los Chachapoyas.

But this time Pizarro&#x27;s envoy met the bellicose resistance of a &quot;curaca&quot; called Huamán, whom they had to defeat before coming to their destination, where they founded the mentioned city on September 5, 1538.

Alvarado had chosen a place called Jalca, which apparently did not have the demanded conditions. This was the reason why the location of the flaming city was changed several times.

According to the papers of the epoch, the last time that a change was made was in 1544, but it is unknown when the city was established in its current place.

The same day of Chachapoyas&#x27; foundation, the members of the first cabildo were elected, turning out to be designated the councillors Gómez de Alvarado, Alonso de Chávez, Gonzalo de Trujillo, Gonzalo de Guzmán, Luis Valera (father of the chronicler Blas Valera), Pedro Romero, Bernardino de Anaya and Francisco de Fuentes.

According to the Spanish custom, the layout of the city was made by means of rectilinear design streets.

===European colonization===
A few years after its foundation, the prosperity of the region began to demonstrate itself in magnificent constructions in the city of Chachapoyas, with big courts, wide lounges and architectural characteristics adapted to the zone.

The colonial aspect of Chachapoyas has stayed almost intact until now, and it is one of the most attractive characteristics of this old city.

A refined religious feeling was one of the characteristics that distinguished the settlers of this region during the colonial period. In the same year of the foundation of Chachapoyas, the first church was built. Its first priest was Hernando Gutiérrez Palacios. Later the churches of Santa Ana, San Lázaro and Señor de Burgos were built.

Three religious convents were also established: San Francisco, La Merced and that of the betlehemitas. The majority of the persons who settled in Chachapoyas from the time of its foundation were people with nobility, but poor. They were living in a modest and worthily way and they devoted themselves to agriculture and mining. Many settlers achieved a loose economic position, keeping, nevertheless, the austerity of the customs that was one of the highlight points of Chachapoyas&#x27; social life.

With time the settlers were spreading to other zones of the region, such as Luya, city that was established in 1569 by the governor Lope García de Castro, ratified later in its administrative organization by the viceroy Francisco de Toledo.

There it bloomed an agriculture of varied production and the upbringing of dairy, sheep and equine cattle.

In one of his pastoral visits, Saint Toribio de Mogrovejo visited the principal populations of this department in this epoch.

===Independence===
The inhabitants of Chachapoyas became involved in the movement for independence. In April 1821, helping the action of San Martin&#x27;s liberating army, they ignored the Spanish authorities, exiling the subdelegate Francisco Baquedano and the bishop of Maynas Hipólito Sánchez, who were fighting openly against independence.

Noted patriots born in Amazonas include:
* Mariano Aguilar
* Manuel Rodríguez
* Luis Zagaceta
* Lucero Villacorta
* Juan Reina
* José Fabián Rodríguez
* Dionisio Hernández

The military chief of Moyobamba, colonel José Matos, organized an army of 600 men, who confronted the patriots on June 6, 1821, in Higos Urco pampa. Although the latter lacked training, military knowledge or discipline, they faced the realistas determined to give their lives in defense of the proclaimed freedom.
Matea Rimachi was an Amazonas woman renowned as a heroine of Higos Urco.

Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza, a professor, politician, philosopher and jurist, was one of the most important patriot leaders of the Amazonas. He signed the record of national independence in Lima. He was the rector of the Convictorio de San Carlos, member of the Sociedad Amantes del País (Lovers of the Country Society), founder and collaborator of the newspaper Mercurio Peruano, deputy of the Spanish Parliament and congressman of the first Constituent Congress, in which the majority of its members were his disciples.

===Republic===
The department of Amazonas was created by a law issued by the government of the marshal Agustín Gamarra, promulgated on November 21, 1832. The initiative belonged to two illustrious children of Chachapoyas: Modesto de la Vega and José Braulio de Camporredondo. Camporredondo was in charge of the presidency of the republic, in absence of the marshall Gamarra. Four years later, a department of the same name was established alongside the Peru–Bolivian Confederation.

The same law contained a series of norms to promote the economic development of the new Hindu network including exonerations of rights in its commerce with Ecuador or Brazil. In accordance with this law, the regions of Pataz, Chachapoyas and Maynas will stay inside the limits of the Amazonas Region.

Salaverry tried futilely to annul the creation of this department that, later, according to diverse demarcating dispositions was diminishing in its area. Most of its territory was dismembered in 1866, when the department of Loreto was created.

The creation of its current provinces was realized in the following dates:

* On February 12, 1821, Chachapoyas.
* On February 5, 1861, Luya.
* On December 26, 1870, Bongará.
* On October 31, 1932, Rodríguez de Mendoza.
* On September 1, 1941, Bagua.
* On May 18, 1984, Condorcanqui.
* On May 30, 1984, Utcubamba.

The colonial splendour of Chachapoyas, almost a complete city, was disappearing during the Republic because it had been imposed in the country a new means of transport that were turning it in a cloistered and outlying city from the rest of the country.

Chachapoyas remained this way during more than one century in the Republic. Without highways, routes connecting to the city had to be done on horse, in long and painful caravans from the coast, or by the rivers from the region of the east. This situation continued until 1960, when highway connections arrived to Chachapoyas, although it had been already preceded by air transport.

Later, during the last government of Manuel Prado, the highway that joins Chachapoyas with the big route of penetration Olmos-Marañon was inaugurated. With this, Amazonas was put in direct communication with Lima and the rest of the Republic.

=== Amazonas ancestors ===
The department of Amazonas possesses a great past that is still precariously evaluated and spread. On its borders, there are fabulous archaeological testimonies like Cuélap, the most extensive monument of the Peruvian ancestral past. Cuélap was the main city of the Chachapoyas culture in their peak years.

====Chachapoyas====

When the Spanish arrived in Peru in the 16th century, the Chachapoya were among the many nations incorporated into the Inca Empire. Their incorporation to the Inca Empire had not been easy, due to the sprouts of resistance that the Chachapoyas offered repeatedly to the Inca&#x27;s troops.

The chronicler Pedro Cieza de León offers some notes about the Chachapoyas:

Cieza adds that, after the annexation to the Inca Empire, the Chachapoya apparently adopted the customs imposed by the people from the department of Cuzco.

The meaning of the word &quot;chachapoya&quot; is unknown. If it is in the Quechua language, it may have been derived from &quot;sacha-p-collas&quot;, meaning the &quot;colla people who live in the woods&quot; (&quot;sacha&quot; = wild &quot;p&quot; = of the &quot;colla&quot; = nation in which Aimara is spoken).

The Chachapoya territory was very extensive. It included the triangular space that is shaped by the confluence of the Marañón and Utcubamba rivers in the zone of Bagua, up to the basin of the Abiseo river. In this place are the Chachapoya&#x27;s ruins of Pajatén. To the south, their territory extended to the Chontayacu river. That was beyond the current border of Amazonas. The center of the Chachapoyas culture was the basin of the Utcubamba river.

this territory has been defined by the remains of structures in the distinctive Chachapoya architectural style. Garcilazo de la Vega records that the Chachapoyas&#x27; territory was so extensive that,

(The league was a measurement that covered about 5 kilometers.)

The area of the Chachapoyas corresponds to a region that was part of a mountain range and covered by dense tropical woods. It was named as the Amazonian Andes, to replace the former &quot;mountain region&quot;.

As fast as the population was growing, the forests of the Amazonian Andes were felled in order to extend the agricultural area. This resulted in destruction of the rain forest and desertification, since the climate and rain combined to make a soil of low fertility. Many plants could not be cultivated here, but deforestation exposed the land to aridity. Soil erosion has taken place in areas that became deforested. In the 21st century, the Amazonian Andes resemble the barren scenery of the Andean moorlands.

The Amazonian Andes are constituted by the oriental flank of the Andes, covered originally by a dense Amazon vegetation. It spread from the cordillera spurs until reaching surprising altitudes where the forests have not been felled, in certain cases exceeding the 3 500 m.

The Amazonian Andes have a height range of 2 to 3,000 meters of altitude, where the Chachapoya could develop their settlements. The numerous architectural remains show they were well established here.

====Before the Inca Empire====

The Amazonas Region has a millennial history. There are some testimonies exhibited on rocky walls dated from the most remote times. Such is the case of the rock paintings of Chiñuña-Yamón and Limones-Calpón in the province of Utcubamba. A part of these haughty pictorial samples was made by people that had a hunting economy. These people perhaps left their trace 6 or 7 thousand years ago. At the times in which the formation of Peruvian civilization was consolidated, it appeared a type of ceramics mainly identified in Bagua.

From the Chachapoyas culture, there are innumerable architectural remains, such as Cuélap, Congón (place that was re-baptized by the name of Vilaya), Olán, Purunllaqta (place that was re-baptized by the name of Monte Peruvia), Pajatén, etc. All these expressions of architecture show a model that allows to identify them like if they are related to each other. What has not been established yet is the age of these architectural remains, neither which one would be the most ancient and which one the last in the cultural development of the chachapoyas.

====Main cultural testimonies====

Some of the archaeological testimonies that talk about the cultural splendour reached by the Chachapoyas in pre-Inca times are fantastic. These principally refer to two forms of grave and one wall painting.

These are some of the most important archeological sites found in the Amazonas Region:
**Sarcophagi of Carajía
**Revash&#x27;s mausoleums
**Tunnels of San Antonio
**Kuelap

==Political division==

The region is divided into 7 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;) which are composed of 83 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces and their capitals are:

== Demographics==

=== Languages ===
According to the 2007 Peru Census, the language learnt first by most of the residents was Spanish (84.90%). The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Amazonas Region by province:

=== Ethnicity ===
The majority of the population is Mestizo. Among others the region is populated by Aguaruna and Huambisa people. 
=== Religion ===
=== Literacy ===
In 2017, 83.4% (326,784) of the population is literate and 16.6% (65,235) of the population is illiterate. 
==Folklore==

The folklore of Amazonas is not as varied as in other departments of Peru.

The profusion of dances, songs and clothing is not seen in here, like in Puno or Cuzco. Its folklore is nourished from legends and stories in which mystery and inexplicable things are always present. Towns, lagoons, hills, religious images, always have an origin that violates in an invariable way the rules of logic or biology.

For example, if you ask people about the lake Quchakunka &quot;(Cochaconga)&quot; they will say that it is enchanted. They say it has the &quot;form of a neck&quot; and that with the smallest noise provoked by an animal or the scream of a person, there will be a tremendous thunderstorm in which an enormous monster will appear in the shape of cow. This monster will become mad with the strangers. That&#x27;s why, whoever passes by this remote place, does it with maximum precautions for not altering the local silence.

To give accommodation to travelers is an elementary norm of good behaviour with people. To deny it can provoke the most tremendous evil on the selfish person. An irrefutable evidence is the marsh of Mono Muerto (Dead Monkey&#x27;s marsh), in the Huambo District (Rodríguez de Mendoza Province). A dramatic story that people tell, with more or less details, but with the same respect.

A very rich man was living in his house. The marsh was a part of his estate, in which he was happy and lacking of nothing, until the day a traveler asked him for home and he denied it to him. A witch doctor of the surroundings, who found out about the attitude of the wealthy neighbor, entrusted that all the curses fell on him. All his goods disappeared and his grounds became a stinking marsh.

Mysterious power are also assumed to the four lagoons of Pukyu, in which there are monsters that influence the crops, as well as to the lake Santa Barbara which disappears before the view of the walkers and it is destined to initiate the end of the world with the overflow of its waters.

Next to the city Chachapoyas there is a hill called Pisquwañuna &quot;(Piscohuañuna)&quot;, in the way towards the forest. This name means &quot;where the bird dies&quot;, because the mountain kills all the birds that approach it.

People attribute pernicious influences to certain animals like the mochuelo that &quot;freezes the soul&quot;, or &quot;quien-quien&quot;, that makes fun of the travelers in the roads; or the cricket, which singing in certain circumstances, like when it has sound of bells, presages big evil.

People have big respect to the antique remains. They firmly believe that there will be terrifying punishments for those who violate the graves of the &quot;agüelos&quot; (mummies).

Most of the population of the department of Amazonas is indigenous and mestizo, being notable the people&#x27; quantity, in some cases entire communities, in which the Spanish type predominates. Since the time of the Incas, there are legends about the existence of white people in these places. There are also versions gathered by chroniclers in which they assure that women were chosen here for the Inca, precisely because they were white.

===Dances===

Some of the dances most representative of the Department of Amazonas are:

* The Chumaichada
* Huanca (dance)
* The Danzantes de Levanto (Levanto&#x27;s Dancers)
* Carnaval en Amazonas (Carnival in Amazonas)

===Religious festivities===

Religiousness is an outstanding note in the most of these towns and they demonstrate it through the enthusiasm and withdrawal that they put into these celebrations. But, faithful to their tradition, their religious beliefs are mixed with fantastic apparitions and there is almost always a cave in them.

There are three Virgins who are famous:
*Virgen de Belén (Virgin of Bethlehem) in Chachapoyas.
*Virgen de Sonche (Virgin of Sonche)
*Virgen de Levanto (Virgin of Levanto)

Well, there is no one who does not believe the story that said that the three Virgins were found in a cave to which a young shepherd was mysteriously attracted. And when the &quot;Virgin of Levanto&quot; goes to Chachapoyas &quot;her sisters&quot; go to the outer parts of the town for &quot;receiving her&quot;.

The venerated image of &quot;Santa Lucía&quot; (Saint Lucy) was also found by a girl in a cave. Cristo de Bagazán (Christ of Bagazán), who is venerated in Rioja, was also found by a stockbreeder who was looking for a lost ox. Near Almirante, he heard a voice that was calling him by his name from the interior of a cave, in which he found a Christ image that told him: &quot;take me&quot;.

In days of long drought, Cristo de la Contradicción (the Christ of Contradiction) disappears from the chapel of the cemetery of Chachapoyas and he is &quot;discovered&quot; when it begins to rain, beginning then big celebrations up to the time of taking him to his place again.

Corpus Christi, Holy Week, the Assumption, Dia de los Difuntos (Day of the death), and Christmas are classic dates in the calendar of this department. In Christmas Days there are groups of little shepherds that walk around the streets singing and dancing in front of the cribs. With the same splendour, the patronal feasts are celebrated in all the towns.

One of the most well-known and traditional celebrations is known as:

*Los pastorcillos de Navidad (Christmas&#x27;s little shepherds)

===Typical dishes===
Some of the most well-known and delicious typical dishes of this region are the following:

*Tamalitos
*Cazuela
*Carne arrollada (rolled beef)
*Purtumute
*Humitas de choclo (sweet tamale made of corn)
*Chipasmute
*Plátanos rellenos (stuffed bananas)

==Economy==
This department includes inter-Andean and forest regions. It has a strong forest and hydro energy potential. The province of Bagua, because of geographical factors, has an agricultural development producing such commodity crops as rice, coffee, Cocoa bean, fruit trees and livestock.

The department of Amazonas presents three well-defined geographical areas with distinct climates:
* District of El Cenepa (province of Condorcanqui), humid tropical forest
* Province of Bagua, has a dry tropical forest; and
* The other provinces have the Amazonian very humid low mountainous forest, humid subtropical forest, and dry low mountainous forest.

The provinces of Bongará, Luya and Chachapoyas present a very hilly geographical configuration, that gives them mountain range characteristics. They have been called the Amazonian Andes.

Amazonas has a primarily agrarian economy. It also features mining and energy, specifically, hydropower and oil development.

The department has excellent and favorable conditions in both: climate and pastures availability for the agricultural-livestock development.

The information about structure of the agricultural surface, size of the agricultural units, main cultivations and cattle population is taken from what was recorded in the III National Agricultural Census 1994 (III CENAGRO), made by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática (INEI) (National Institute of Statistics and Informatics).

The department of Amazonas has 48,173 agricultural units (UA) with . 99.9% of the UA have lands and 0.1% do not have them. This 0.1% are exclusively dedicated to the breeding of animals.

===Structure of the agricultural area===

* It only considers the area of the agricultural units that have worked lands.

&quot;From the total of agricultural lands (9750.34 km2), only 16,4% includes the agricultural area and 83,6% includes the non-agricultural area.&quot;

===Size of the agricultural units and principal cultivations===

* It only considers the area of the agricultural units that have worked lands.

&quot;Agricultural units with and more only represent 4.4% of the whole department, but concentrate 61.8% of the agricultural surface.&quot;

&quot;Rice is the main transitory cultivation of the department. It brings together 18.5% of the agricultural surface with transitory cultivations (129.42 km2). Dry yellow maize with (17.9%) is the second important one.&quot;

&quot;Coffee concentrates 66.4% of the agricultural area with permanent cultivations (198.19 km2), followed by &quot;Theobroma cacao&quot; (cocoa bean) with (10,5%).&quot;

===Livestock population by species===

&quot;Cattle is the most important one in the department. It is raised in 21,857 AU (Agricultural units) with a population of 139,267 head of cattle. Pigs are the second one with 34,421 head, distributed in 14,573 AU.&quot;

<doc id="713209" wikidata="Q3944823" url="?curid=713209" title="Rate of exploitation">
<text>In Marxian economics, the rate of exploitation is the ratio of the total amount of unpaid labor done (surplus-value) to the total amount of wages paid (the value of labour power). The rate of exploitation is often also called the rate of surplus-value.

==Divergence of the two rates==
Marx did not regard the rate of surplus value and the rate of exploitation as necessarily identical, &quot;insofar&quot; as there was a divergence between surplus value &quot;realised&quot; and surplus value &quot;produced&quot;. Thus, the quantity of surplus labour performed by workers in an enterprise might correspond to a value higher or lower than the surplus value actually &quot;realised&quot; as profit income upon sales of output. The implication is that if the gross profit volume was related to wage costs to establish the rate of surplus value, this might overstate or understate the real rate of labor-exploitation. Although this is a subtle point, it has sometimes played an important role in wage bargaining negotiations by trade unions. For an extreme example, workers might work extremely hard in an enterprise which nevertheless operates at a loss. For another extreme example, workers might work less hard, knowing that their product will sell like hotcakes in a seller&#x27;s market at sharply inflated prices, yielding profits disproportionate to labour input. The divergence between surplus value &quot;realised&quot; and surplus value &quot;produced&quot; becomes even more marked if surplus value is viewed in terms of the net incomes of social classes, i.e. net labor income and net property income. Marx identified five different formulae for the rate of surplus value (see surplus value).

<doc id="713210" wikidata="Q208185" url="?curid=713210" title="Department of Apurímac">
<text>Apurímac () is a department in southern-central Peru. It is bordered on the east by the Department of Cusco, on the west by the Department of Ayacucho, and on the south by the Arequipa and Ayacucho departments. The department&#x27;s name originates from the Quechua language and means &quot;where the gods speak&quot; in reference to the many mountains of the region (gods in the Andean religion) that seem to be talking to each other.

==Political division==
The region is divided into 7 provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which are composed of 80 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:

* Abancay (Abancay)
* Andahuaylas (Andahuaylas)
* Antabamba (Antabamba)
* Aymaraes (Chalhuanca)
* Chincheros (Chincheros)
* Cotabambas (Tambobamba)
* Grau (Chuquibambilla)

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the 2007 Peru Census, the first language learned by most of the residents was Quechua (70.58%) followed by Spanish (29.01%). The Quechua varieties spoken in Apurímac are Cusco Quechua and Chanka Quechua. The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Apurímac Region by province:

=== Ethnicity ===
Over 80% of the population identifies as Quechua as of 2017.
=== Religion ===
Most of the population is Catholic at nearly 80%. 

=== Literacy ===
80.8% (324,938) of the population is literate and 19.2% (77,347) of the population is illiterate. 

==History==

Little is known about the region&#x27;s origins. However, chroniclers note that the first settlers were formed by tribes of several regions originating among the Quechua and Aymaras. The Chancas, originally from Choclococha and Huancavelica, settled in the region of Andahuaylas. This group of tribes is historically known as rebellious and fearless warriors of ancient Peru.

Chronicles relate that the Chancas prepared themselves for years to conquer the imperial city of Cusco. Only due to the great figure and strategy of Inca Pachacutec, the Inca Empire did not yield.

By the time the conquerors established the first political organization of the Colony, almost the whole extension of the current region was under the jurisdiction of the authorities of Huamanga; nevertheless, there is no recollection on the foundation of cities and towns.

At the beginning of the Republic, Abancay belonged to Cusco. It was not until April 28, 1873, that a law was given to create the department of Apurímac, based on the provinces of Andahuaylas (Ayacucho), Antabamba, Aymaraes and Cotabambas (Cusco), and naming Abancay as its capital.

==Attractions==

Abancay is the capital and most important economic and political center. Also in the region is Andahuaylas, a rather cold city, located at 2980 meters above sea level (9,800 ft) and the region&#x27;s agricultural centre. Its main church is the Cathedral de San Pedro, built in Colonial style architecture. A one-piece stone fountain stands out in the Plaza de Armas. Close to Abancay in the way to Cusco is the famed Saywite Stone.

Another notable place favored by visitors is Talavera de la Reyna, located from Andahuaylas. The main square or Plaza de Armas is remarkable, built in stone with an impressive tower with a clock. Nearby, the thermal baths of Hualalache may be visited.
Chalhuanca, the capital of the province of Aymaraes, located at 2,800 m (2,100 ft), preserves beautiful churches built during Colonial times, containing fine wood carvings and gold leaf. A detailed account of Apurímac &#x27;s architecture can be found in the works of Peruvian Writer and architect Armando Arteaga.

In Antabamba, trepanations so accurately performed that astonishing medicines have been found there, in addition to mud sculptures, weapons, domestic utensils, and hunting implements.

Considered one of the largest and most beautiful lakes of Peru, Paqucha Lake is located at 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in the route between Andahuaylas and Abancay. Known as an ideal place to rest and enjoy nature, fishing and duck hunting are permitted.

==Local customs==

===Typical dishes and beverages===
A typical Apurímac Region dish is the &quot;wathiya&quot;. Traceable to ancient times, this is prepared by building a fire surrounded by stones, on the center of which potatoes are placed until done. The ancient settlers used to prepare it during sowing and harvesting.

A dish that is also well known in Apurímac is potatoes and eggs with &quot;uchullaqwa&quot;, a sauce made with chili, cottage cheese and &quot;Tagetes minuta&quot;, a culinary herb known in Peru as &quot;wakatay&quot;, a word that derives from the Quechua language. Among the variety of breads, we find &quot;rejillas&quot;, &quot;tarapacos&quot;, &quot;paltos&quot; and &quot;roscas&quot;.

===Festivities===
January 1 through 6 feature New Year&#x27;s celebrations in Andahuaylas. During this period the &quot;Baja de Negros&quot; (dancers disguised as black men) is celebrated. There is entertainment of all sorts, especially religious folklore.

February is celebrated with Carnivals. The whole town fills the streets to participate in &quot;La Yunsa&quot;. It is the only opportunity in which Apurímac shows all its folklore, with disguised groups dancing through all quarters. In Andahuaylas, women and men dance in groups day and night. In Grau, bullfights are organized, and the day before, the torril velacuy or velada de toros takes place to drive away evil spirits and avoid any harm to the toreros. In Aymaraes, a sling tournament between several districts takes place, a kind of duel, at times typically leaving several participants wounded.

May 13. &quot;Fiesta de la Virgen de Fátima&quot;. A great demonstration of folklore, specially music and dance. Numerous musical groups arrive to Grau to show their arts.

June 24. Farm Products and Livestock Fair in Pachaconas (Antabamba), where the best products of the region are exhibited. A &quot;majordomo&quot;, called Carguyoc, is in charge of entertaining the guests.

July 28. &quot;Yawar Fiesta&quot; (&quot;blood festival&quot;) in Andahuaylas. A special bullfight in which a condor is tied to the back of the bull. In its efforts to release itself from the back of the bull, the condor wounds the bull. The bull is then killed by the condor, or by the villagers. The condor is released after the fiesta. Also, there are cockfights and the traditional ride to the lake Paqucha, for good trout fishing.

August 15. &quot;Fiesta de la Virgen de la Asunción&quot;. The people of Grau crowd the streets to take part in processions and prayers. Simultaneously, the tinka or branding of the cattle takes place. In Cotabambas, the festivity is celebrated with the &quot;Yawar Fiesta&quot;.

September 8. &quot;Fiesta de Nuestra Señora de Cocharcas&quot;. This Marian advocation is also known as Machacha Cocharcas and is one of the most adored in Apurimac and throughout Peru since the sixteenth century.

September 24. &quot;Fiesta de Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes&quot;. The whole town of Antabamba is invited to dance, drink, eat or to the bullfights and horse racing.

October 7. &quot;Fiesta de la Virgen del Rosario&quot;. Everyone in Abancay takes part. There are processions and fireworks. The &quot;alferado&quot; or &quot;majordomo&quot; is responsible for the expenses of the feast.

November 3. The anniversary of the city of Abancay. Celebrated with several sports, folklore and social activities. Also, cockfights and bullfights.

December 8. &quot;Fiesta de la Virgen de la Concepción&quot;. In Cotabambas, dancing is featured in the main square during three or four nights, before and after the celebrations.

December 25. During Christmas Eve and Christmas, the people of Cotabambas go out to dance in the streets together with disguised dancers. Large crowds salute the Holy Child in adoration with songs and prayers. There are also processions, fireworks and banquets with typical food.

<doc id="713212" wikidata="Q205068" url="?curid=713212" title="Department of Arequipa">
<text>Arequipa () is a department and region in southwestern Peru. It is the sixth largest department in Peru, after Puno, Cuzco, Madre de Dios, Ucayali, and Loreto, its sixth most populous department, and its eleventh least densely populated department. It is bordered by the departments of Ica, Ayacucho, Apurímac and Cusco in the north, the Department of Puno in the east, the Department of Moquegua in the south, and the Pacific Ocean in the west. Its capital, also called Arequipa, is Peru&#x27;s second-largest city.

==Geography==

This department has a rough topography, which is characterised by heavy layers of volcanic lava covering large areas of its inter-Andean sector. It has deep canyons such as the ones formed by the Ocoña and Majes rivers. Plateaus range in height from medium, such as La Joya, and high-altitude ones such the Arrieros Pampa and those located in the zones of Chivay, Huambo and Pichucolla. Volcanic cones, such as Misti, Chachani, Ampato, Mismi, Solimana and Coropuna, emerge above the plateaus and attract snowfall. In contrast with these heights, there are deep canyons, including Majes, Colca, Sihuas and Ocoña, where important aspects of the ecological evolution of this zone can be clearly observed.

Along the coast, small plateaus and dunes represent characteristics of the desert of Arequipa, such as the ones located in the Majes, Sihuas and La Joya plains. These are particularly beautiful and developed.

From a hydrographic point of view, the rivers draining its territory belong mainly to the Pacific watershed. Some rivers belong to the Amazon hydrographic system. Some of the region&#x27;s main rivers are: Ocoña, Yauca, Camaná and Quilca. The starting point of the Amazon River is located in the Arequipa region.

The Highest Mountains of Arequipa are:
# Coropuna 6,425 mamsl, Ampato Range.
# Ampato 6,288 mamsl, Ampato Range.
# Solimana 6,093 mamsl, Ampato Range.
# Chachani 6,057 mamsl, Volcanic Range.
# Hualca Hualca 6,025 mamsl, Ampato Range.
# Sabancaya 5,976 mamsl, Ampato Range.
# Misti 5,822 mamsl, Volcanic Range.
# Nocarane 5,784 mamsl, Volcanic Range.
# Pichu Pichu 5,664 mamsl, Volcanic Range.
# Chila 5,654 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Casiri 5,647 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Mismi 5,597 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Minaspata 5,555 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Quehuisha 5,514 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Surihuiri 5,506 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Tacune 5,500 mamsl, Volcanic Range.
# Firura 5,498 mamsl, Ampato Range.
# Yuraccasa 5,465 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Jatunpila 5,450 mamsl, Chila Range.
# Jatun Huaychahui 5,445 mamsl, Huanzo Range

==Political division==

The region is divided into eight provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which are composed of 109 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:
# Arequipa (Arequipa)
# Camaná (Camaná)
# Caravelí (Caravelí)
# Castilla (Aplao)
# Caylloma (Chivay)
# Condesuyos (Chuquibamba)
# Islay (Mollendo)
# La Unión (Cotahuasi)

== Demographics ==
=== Languages ===
According to the 2007 Peru Census, the first language learned by most of the residents was Spanish (83.17%), followed by the native language of Quechua (14.78%). The Quechua variety spoken in Arequipa is Cusco–Collao Quechua.

The following table shows the first languages by province in the Arequipa Region by province:

=== Ethnicity ===

As of 2017, the largest ethnicity in the Arequipa region are the Mestizo, followed by the Quechua.
=== Religion ===
In 2017, over 80% of Arequipa&#x27;s population was Catholic.
=== Literacy ===
In 2017, 91.5% (1,274,358) of the population was literate and 8.5% (118,691) of the population was illiterate.

==Points of interest==

There are numerous points of interest in the Arequipa region. The three coastal provinces, Caraveli, Camana and Islay all have popular beaches. Various ports can also be found along the coastline, the two most important being Mollendo and Matarani, both in the province of Islay.

The Colca Canyon, twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the United States, is situated in the province of Caylloma. The Cotahuasi Canyon is in the La Union Province. Colca Valley provides incredible close-up views of majestic Andean condors soaring in their natural habitat. Cotahuasi, at , is thought to be the deepest canyon in the world. Both canyons offer spectacular scenery and villages as yet unaffected by the modern world.

In the Castilla Province near Corire, Toro Muerto (meaning &quot;dead bull&quot; in Spanish) is an area with more than 3,000 ancient petroglyphs dating to the ancient Wari culture of 500–1000 CE, which dominated much of this region. Further to the north near Andaguas lies the Valley of Volcanoes. Almost 100 cones of various sizes dominate the lava-hardened landscape.

<doc id="713220" wikidata="Q230683" url="?curid=713220" title="Organic composition of capital">
<text>The organic composition of capital (OCC) is a concept created by Karl Marx in his theory of capitalism, which was simultaneously his critique of the political economy of his time. It is derived from his more basic concepts of &#x27;value composition of capital&#x27; and &#x27;technical composition of capital&#x27;. Marx defines the organic composition of capital as &quot;the value-composition of capital, in so far as it is determined by its technical composition and mirrors the changes of the latter&quot;. The &#x27;technical composition of capital&#x27; measures the relation between the elements of constant capital (plant, equipment and materials) and variable capital (wage workers). It is &#x27;technical&#x27; because no valuation is here involved. In contrast, the &#x27;value composition of capital&#x27; is the ratio between the value of the elements of constant capital involved in production and the value of the labor. Marx found that the special concept of &#x27;organic composition of capital&#x27; was sometimes useful in analysis, since it assumes that the relative values of all the elements of capital are constant.

== Overview ==
In Book I of Capital, Marx made the simplifying assumption that all valuation was in terms of what is often called labor-values (and he called &#x27;values&#x27;). In Book III, however, he states that equilibrium values between industries could not be directly proportional to their labor content. The latter only determined equilibrium values in his pre-capitalist &#x27;Simple Commodity Production&#x27;, where the producers owned their means of production and natural resources were used freely. In Book III, first he assumed that land could be used freely and showed that the equilibrium prices were his &#x27;prices of production&#x27;. Later, when he introduced land ownership and the rent on land, the equilibrium prices were to be &#x27;modified production prices&#x27; that took the rent of land into account. The implication of this is that the valuation used for the &#x27;value composition of capital&#x27; had to be accordingly modified, since the labor-values used throughout Book I was an expedient he used in order to not excessively complicate the communication of this theory. But Marx was not able to complete to his satisfaction Books II and III.

The various distinct concepts related to the composition of capital are often used in contemporary Marxian economics as a theoretical alternative to similar neo-classical concepts. The neoclassical concept most similar to the increasing organic composition of capital is capital deepening.
Marx&#x27;s concept of constant capital is the monetary value of the plant, equipment and materials that are tied up in the production process. And his concept of variable capital is the money value that is tied up in the payment of wages. The concept of OCC does not apply to &quot;all&quot; capital assets, only to those invested in production (i.e. it excludes assets that are in the &#x27;sphere of consumption&#x27;, such as homes). 
In &quot;Capital Vol. 3&quot; Marx demonstrates that the organic composition of capital decisively influences industrial profitability. According to Marx, the OCC expresses the specific form which the capitalist mode of production gives to the relationship between means of production and labor power, determining the productivity of labor and the creation of a surplus product. This relationship has both technical and social aspects, reflecting the fact that simultaneously consumable use values and commercial exchange-values are being produced.

Marx argues that a rising organic composition of capital is a necessary effect of capital accumulation and competition in the sphere of production, at least in the long term. This means that the share of constant capital in the total capital outlay increases, and that labor input per product unit declines.

In his discussion, Marx leaves out of account components of capital other than labour-power and means of production invested in, such as the faux frais of production (incidental expenses). The full importance of the OCC emerges in chapter 8 of the third volume of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;.

==Ratios==

The value composition of capital (VCC) is usually expressed as a ratio of constant capital to variable capital, or formula_1. Other measures are also used in the Marxian literature. One is formula_2. This is the ratio of constant capital to newly produced value (roughly, what modern economists call &quot;value added&quot;), i.e., surplus-value + variable capital and close to the concept of a capital/output ratio. Less common is the measure used by Paul M. Sweezy, i.e., formula_3, the ratio of constant capital to the total capital invested.

The total capital tied up by a capitalist enterprise includes more than fixed assets, materials and wages/salaries; it also includes liquid funds, reserves and other financial assets.
For instance, an employer must normally reserve funds to pay for ongoing operating expenses, until these are recouped from product sales.

==Measures==

An empirical proxy measure for the technical composition of capital (TCC) is the average amount of fixed equipment and materials used per worker (capital intensity), or the ratio of the average amount of equipment &amp; materials used to the total hours worked. The value composition of capital (VCC) is usually measured by summing the value of fixed capital (&quot;Cf&quot;) and intermediate expenditures (circulating capital or &quot;Cc&quot;) and dividing the total by the value of labour costs (V). The estimation procedure is not simple, for example because compensation of employees includes more than wages and part of the tax levy constitutes an element of surplus value.

In modern national accounts, an empirical proxy of the flow of variable capital is the wage-payments associated with productive activity in an accounting period, and a proxy for constant capital (flow measure) is depreciation charges + intermediate consumption; a stock measure of constant capital would be the fixed capital stock plus the average value of inventories held during the period of account (usually a year). However, because the &quot;circulating&quot; component of constant capital (denoted &quot;Cc&quot;) includes purchases of external services and other operating costs, the stock of Cc is sometimes measured as the flow of intermediate consumption divided by the average inventory level.

The variable capital actually tied up by an enterprise at any point in time will usually be less than the annual flow value, because wages can in part be paid out of revenues received from ongoing product sales. Thus, the capital reserves held by an enterprise for paying wages may, at any time, be only 1/10 or so of their annual flow value.

The most accurate quantitative estimates for the OCC refer to the outlays in specific sectors, e.g. manufacturing.

==Examples==

By any of these measures, the plant- and machinery-intensive oil industry would have a high organic composition of capital, while labor-intensive businesses such as catering would tend to have a low OCC. The OCC varies according to differences in production technology, between sectors of an economy, or according to changes in production technology over time.

==The OCC and crises==

The magnitude of the OCC is important in Marxist crisis theory because of its impact on the average rate of profit. The implication of a rise in the organic composition of capital is a declining rate of profit; for every new increase in surplus-value realised as profit from sales, an even larger corresponding increase in constant capital investment becomes necessary.

But this represents only a &quot;tendency&quot;, Marx argues, because the fall of the rate of profit can be offset by counteracting influences. The main ones include:

*buying constant capital inputs at a lower cost.
*an increase in the rate of exploitation and productivity of labour power (including the intensity of work).
*a reduction of the turnover-time of constant capital inputs.
*the reduction of salaries and labour costs paid.
*a pool of abundant cheap labor, at home or abroad.
*foreign trade which reduces constant capital-input costs.
*technological innovations which reduce constant capital-input costs.
*the specific distribution of surplus-value as profit, interest, rent, taxes and fees, and the division between distributed and undistributed components of the new value added.
*market expansion (more sales, in less time).
*monopolistic or oligopolistic pricing of outputs, or in some way artificially raising output prices.
*reduction of the tax burden
*criminal methods to reduce costs and increase sales and profits

Because numerous different factors can affect profitability, the overall effects of a rising OCC on average industrial profitability therefore really have to be evaluated empirically in a longer time-span, e.g. 20–25 years.

Insofar as the trajectory of capitalist development is, as Marx argues, ruled by the quest for extra surplus-value, the economic fate of the system can be summarised as an interaction between the tendency of the profit rate to decline, and the factors that counteract it: in other words, the permanent battle to reduce costs, increase sales and increase profits.

The hypothetical final result of the rising OCC would be full automation of the production process, in which case labour-costs would be near-zero. This is argued to herald the end of capitalism&#x27;s functioning as both a profit generating economic system for capitalists, and as a social system, among other things because the capitalist system does not contain a means for distributing incomes other than that based on labour-effort, and full automation would negate the concept of exploitation.

==Marx and Ricardo==

The different organic compositions of capital of different branches of industry raised a problem for the classical economic schema of David Ricardo and others, who could not reconcile their labor-cost theory of price with the existence of differences in the OCC between sectors. The latter imply different profit rates in different industries. Also, while market competition would establish a ruling price level for a type of output, different enterprises would use more or less labour to produce it. For these reasons, values &quot;produced&quot; and prices &quot;realised&quot; by different producers would quantitatively diverge.

Marx either solved this problem with his theory of prices of production and the tendency for profitability differentials to be levelled out through competition, or he failed to solve it, according to which side of the debate over the transformation problem one finds convincing.

Others see this &quot;problem&quot; (the development of a mathematical relationship between prices and labor-values) as a false one, rejecting the idea that Marx aimed to use his labor theory value to understand relative prices. Here the argument is that he aimed to reveal only the &quot;social nature&quot; or &quot;deep structure&quot; of capitalist society.

In a third interpretation, Marx aspired both to relate values and prices, and offer a social critique, because both of these were necessary to make his case truly convincing. Here, the separate concepts of product-values and product-prices are regarded as essential for a theory of market &quot;dynamics&quot; and capitalist competition; it is argued that price behaviour in aggregate cannot be understood or theorised about at all without reference to value-relations, explicitly or implicitly.

==Historical trends==

There has been a lengthy theoretical and statistical dispute among Marxian economists about whether the organic composition of capital really does tend to, or has to rise historically, as Marx predicted, or, to put it differently, whether in aggregate technological progress has a &quot;labor-saving bias&quot;, and causes the average profit rate to decline.

One sort of question asked is, why capitalists would introduce new technology, if doing so would result specifically in a lower profit rate on capital invested? Marx&#x27;s reply is essentially that:

*when a successful new technology or product is first introduced on the market, the pioneering producers typically obtain an additional profit (or superprofit), but when the use of the innovation spreads and is more generally applied, profitability declines for all producers.
*competition between capitalists &quot;forces&quot; the introduction of new technologies, whether they like it or not, since the productivity gains of competitors threaten to put them out of business, or reduce their market-shares.
*while average profit &quot;rates&quot; on capital invested may decline as a result, profit &quot;margins&quot; (or profit volumes) will increase, because more output can be produced and sold in a given accounting period, using the new technologies (implying unit-costs for products made will decline).

The statistical and historical evidence about the Kondratiev waves of capitalist development from the 1830s onwards is certainly favourable to Marx&#x27;s theory of the rising organic composition of capital. It is difficult to find industries where the &quot;secular&quot; historical trend is one of an increase in the share of wages in the total capital outlay. Generally, the opposite is the case.

However, it has been argued that the value of physical capital is notoriously difficult to measure empirically in an accurate way; and statistical time-series for economic variables over long periods are also susceptible to errors and distortions. The owners of a business may not even know exactly what the physical assets they use are currently worth, or what their business is currently worth, as a going concern. That worth is hypothetical until such time as the business is sold and paid for. However, the modern trend in official accounting standards is certainly for assets to be valued more and more at their &quot;current market value&quot;, or current replacement cost, rather than at historic (original acquisition) cost.

In addition, during severe economic slumps, physical capital assets are subject to devaluation, lie idle or are destroyed, while workers become unemployed; the empirical effect is to &quot;reduce&quot; the organic composition of capital. Likewise, non-profitable war production can also lower the average OCC.

Finally, a technological revolution can also radically change the proportions between constant and variable capital, reducing the cost of constant capital, and lowering the OCC. In that case, operating costs are reduced in a short span of time, or cheaper alternatives substitute for the inputs traditionally used.

Much less discussed in the economic literature is the effect on the organic composition of capital of the growth of the services sector in the developed countries. For example, does the widespread use of computers in labour-intensive services lower the OCC?

<text>Ayacucho (), known as Huamanga from its creation in 1822 until 1825, is a department and region of Peru, located in the south-central Andes of the country. Its capital is the city of Ayacucho. The region was one of the hardest hit in the 1980s during the guerrilla war waged by Shining Path known as the internal conflict in Peru.

A referendum was held on 30 October 2005, in order to decide whether the department would merge with the departments of Ica and Huancavelica to form the new Ica-Ayacucho-Huancavelica Region, as part of the decentralization process in Peru. The proposal failed and no merger was carried out.

==Political division==

The department is divided into 11 provinces (, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which are composed of 111 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;).

===Provinces===
The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:

# Cangallo (Cangallo)
# Huamanga (Ayacucho)
# Huanca Sancos (Huanca Sancos)
# Huanta (Huanta)
# La Mar (San Miguel)
# Lucanas (Puquio)
# Parinacochas (Coracora)
# Paucar del Sara Sara (Pausa)
# Sucre (Querobamba)
# Víctor Fajardo (Huancapi)
# Vilcas Huamán (Vilcas Huamán)

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the 2007 Peru Census, the language learnt first by most of the residents was Quechua (63.05%) followed by Spanish (36.57%). The Quechua variety spoken in Ayacucho is Chanka Quechua. The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the department by province:

<doc id="713237" wikidata="Q593875" url="?curid=713237" title="Maniple (military unit)">
<text>Maniple (; ) was a tactical unit of the Roman Republican armies, adopted during the Samnite Wars (343–290 BC). It was also the name of the military insignia carried by such units.

Maniple members, called &quot;commanipulares&quot; (: &quot;commanipularis&quot;) were seen as each other&#x27;s brothers-in-arms, but without the domestic closeness of the eight-man &quot;contubernium&quot;.

Cohorts replaced maniples as organisational units.

==History==
The manipular system was adopted around 315 BC, during the Second Samnite War. The rugged terrain of Samnium, where the war was fought, was not conducive to the phalanx formation which the Romans had inherited from the Etruscans and Ancient Greeks. The main battle troops of the Etruscans and Latins of this period comprised Greek-style hoplite phalanxes, inherited from the original Greek phalanx military unit.

After suffering a series of defeats, culminating in the surrender of the entire army without resistance at Caudine Forks, the Romans abandoned the phalanx altogether, adopting the more flexible manipular system, famously referred to as &quot;a phalanx with joints&quot;.

The manipular system was faded from ancient sources and was replaced by the cohort unit.

==Structure==

Polybius first described the maniple in the mid-2nd century BC. The manipular legion was organized into four lines, starting at the front: the &quot;velites&quot;; the &quot;hastati&quot;; the &quot;principes&quot;; and the &quot;triarii&quot;. These were divided by experience, with the younger soldiers at the front lines and the older soldiers near the back. One theory proposed by J. E. Lendon asserts that this order was adapted to the Roman culture of bravery, allowing an initial show of individual heroics among the younger soldiers.

At the front of the legion organized into maniples, the &quot;velites&quot; formed a swarm of soldiers which engaged the enemy at the start of the battle. Their duties involved skirmishing, and they often worked closely with the cavalry. Next, the &quot;hastati&quot; were the youngest and least experienced soldiers, and therefore fought on the front-lines. They formed the first line of heavy infantry. The &quot;principes&quot; were more experienced soldiers who stood behind the &quot;hastati&quot; in battle. Finally, the &quot;triarii&quot; were the veteran soldiers with the most experience. 

The second and third echelon generally formed with a one maniple space between each maniple and its neighbours. Retreating troops of the &quot;velites&quot; could withdraw without disrupting those behind them. Where resistance was strong the &quot;hastati&quot; would dissolve back through the Roman line, allowing the more experienced soldiers in the &quot;principes&quot; to fight. In turn, the &quot;principes&quot; could then yield to the hardened &quot;triarii&quot;, if necessary. At this point in battle, the maniple greatly resembled the phalanx. Apart from allowing retreat, these gaps also proved invaluable against enemy phalanxes and provided the Romans with a major tactical advantage against their Greek foes. In order to maintain its wall of spears, the phalanx required rigid battle lines, which could not easily break into smaller units. Gaps in the maniples thus lured hoplites in and disrupted their formation, after which they became disorganized, surrounded, and easy prey for Roman swords.

According to Polybius, the most complete and likely the most accurate account, the legion consisted of 10 maniples of 120 &quot;hastati&quot;, 10 maniples of 120 &quot;principes&quot;, and 10 half strength maniples of &quot;triarii&quot; containing 60 men each. With 1,200 &quot;velites&quot; and 300 cavalrymen a legion numbered 4,500 men. However, in times of great need the number might be reinforced up to 5,000.

==Equipment==

The echelons differed not only in their roles, but also in their equipment. Polybius describes their panoply in detail. First, the velites were armed with a sword, javelins, and a small shield called a parma. They wore no armor, apart from a helmet, which was often covered in animal skins. Polybius asserts that these skins not only protected the helmet, but also served as a means of identification, such that soldiers could be remembered and later rewarded for acts of bravery. Next, the hastati were armed in &quot;full panoply.&quot; Their armament included a sword, javelins, and a large, reinforced shield. For armor, they wore a helmet decorated with tall plumes designed to make its wearer appear larger, as well as a sheet of metal called a &quot;heart plate&quot; to protect the chest. Principes were equipped in the same manner as the hastati. Wealthier soldiers (of a property value greater than 10,000 drachmas) could afford a chain-mail cuirass. Finally, the triarii were equipped like the other infantry, with the exception of a thrusting spear in place of javelins.

This equipment was generally lighter and cheaper than that of the Servian hoplites that preceded the maniple. It emphasized the flexibility of the maniple system and allowed for lightly armored, highly mobile soldiers. Moreover, because purchasing the equipment was the responsibility of the individual soldier, its affordability helped increase the number of citizens eligible for military service.

<text>Paddle Scotland, formerly the Scottish Canoe Association (; ) or SCA, is the national governing body for canoeing, kayaking and other paddlesport in Scotland.

It covers all branches of the sport from recreational activities to canoe slalom; wildwater racing; flatwater sprint racing and marathon racing; canoe sailing; canoe polo; surf kayaking and canoeing; and extreme racing (including the international event on the Glen Nevis in Lochaber).

==History==
The Scottish Canoe Association was founded in 1939. The association was founded by four canoe clubs: the Canoe Section of the Camping Club, Clyde Canoe Club, Forth Canoe Club (1934) and Scottish Youth Hostels Canoe Club. 

In March 2024, the company rebranded themselves as Paddle Scotland.

 they state that they have more than 80 affiliated clubs. The body now has approximately 3,000 individual members, including 1,750 qualified coaches.

== Performance ==
In March 2019, SCA announced double Olympic medallist Jon Schofield as their head of performance and pathways.

SCA Performance runs programmes in 2 Olympic disciplines, sprint and slalom canoeing. Rio 2016 saw the introduction of paracanoe in the Paralympic programme and SCA aim to support the identification of Scottish athletes to join the British canoeing programme centrally delivered in Nottingham High Performance Centre.

== Disciplines ==
There is a diverse range of different disciplines covered by Scottish Canoe Association. Along with the traditional competitive disciplines (including the two Olympic disciplines of Sprint and Slalom) there are several recreational disciplines:

== Regional development ==
SCA have 9 regions in Scotland. They are Borders, Central, Fife, Tayside, Grampian and Shetland, Highlands and Islands, Lothians, South West and West.

Each region has its own regional officer, whose purpose is to:

* Support the delivery of SCA strategy within the region
* Act as a regional contact for SCA members, affiliated clubs and centres linking them to SCA volunteers, committees and staff as appropriate
* Support SCA coaching and development work in the region
* Represent the SCA coaching service within the region
* Be a regional ambassador for SCA and British canoeing

== Governance ==

The SCA board is responsible for high-level planning, governance, and compliance with legislation. SCA committees deal with specific paddling development and planning and therefore play a key role in the delivery of SCA activities. The board and committees are strongly supported by employed staff in areas of coaching and development, performance and administration.

The Scottish Canoe Association (SCA) has recently formed an Ethics and Compliance Committee to uphold ethical standards and ensure regulatory compliance. This committee works alongside existing governance structures to promote integrity and accountability within the organization. This initiative reflects the SCA&#x27;s commitment to transparent and ethical governance.

He registered one assist in the playoffs on the way to the Lightning winning the Stanley Cup. Perrin is best friend of Lightning winger Martin St. Louis.

During the 2004–05 NHL lock-out, Perrin re-signed with the AHL Hershey Bears, where he was named the team&#x27;s MVP, as well as the Man of the Year for his charitable contributions. The next season, rather than re-sign with the Bears, he elected to go back overseas, and signed with Swiss team SC Bern. During the Playoffs in the Swiss Nationalliga B he played with the EHC Biel. Once the Swiss season ended, he re-signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning, and on November 2, 2006, he scored his first NHL goal against the Philadelphia Flyers into an empty net in a 5-2 Lightning victory.

Perrin signed with the Atlanta Thrashers on July 1, 2007. In the 2007–08 NHL season with the Thrashers, he recorded career highs in assists (33) and points (45). He last played for the Atlanta Thrashers of the National Hockey League and he joined Avangard Omsk of the KHL on September 3, 2009. Perrin was cut from his try-out with the Tampa Bay Lightning on October 5, 2010. In his NHL career he recorded 32 goals and 104 points in 245 games with the Tampa Bay Lightning and Atlanta Thrashers. He was also a member of the 2004 Stanley Cup winning Tampa Bay Lightning.

In October 2010 he signed a two-year deal to return with JYP of the SM-liiga.

On February 23, 2015, Perrin announced that JYP and he had come to a mutual agreement in which Perrin would leave JYP at the end of the 2014-15 Liiga season. On April 21, 2015, HC TPS announced they had signed Perrin as a free agent to a multi-year contract.

Prior to the 2018–19 season, Perrin continued his longevity in returning to former club, JYP Jyväskylä, on a one-year contract on June 11, 2018. On March 19 JYP lost on the first round of Liiga playoffs and Perrin retired.

<text>Cajamarca (; ; ) is a department and region in Peru. The capital is the city of Cajamarca. It is located in the north part of the country and shares a border with Ecuador. The city has an elevation of above sea level in the Andes Mountain Range, the longest mountain range in the world. Part of its territory includes the Amazon Rainforest, the largest in the world.

==History==

The oldest known irrigation canals in the Americas are located in the Nanchoc District of Cajamarca Department. The canals in the Zaña Valley have been radiocarbon dated to 3400 BCE, and possibly date to 4700 BCE. From the 6th to the 10th century the people of the Wari culture ruled earlier cultures in the highlands. They established the administrative center of Wiraquchapampa.

In the 15th century, the Incas conquered the territory, expanding their empire. They established their regional capital in what is now Cajamarca. The Incas in 1465 established a new province there to serve as a bridge to their later conquests.

Cajamarca had long been one of the oldest cities in South America when the Spanish arrived in their conquest of Peru.

==Political division==
The Region is divided into 13 provinces.

<text>The Forth Canoe Club, founded in 1934, is Scotland&#x27;s oldest surviving canoe club. It is the only remaining club to have been a participating party in the founding of the Scottish Canoe Association. The other canoe clubs that were founding parties where Clyde, Tay and the Scottish Youth Hostellers.

The club&#x27;s motto, &quot;&quot; means &quot;by wind and by skill&quot;.

The first commodore of Forth Canoe Club was Lady Mearns and the subsequent commodore was Jack Cuthill. The club was based around the old primary school in Granton ran by Jack Cuthill which became the Compass Adventure Centre for Sailors and Soldiers during the war where those of military service could meet and go canoeing.

In 1968(ish) it moved to the Lochrin Basin at the Edinburgh end of the Union Canal following a fire that broke out in the original clubhouse down at the harbour. The fire was labelled accidental, however the club were disappointed to see their return to the Harbor was unlikely as significant redevelopment in Granton followed the clubs relocation. The Lochrin basin became the new home of the club and its 4 sheds were used for the activities from boat storage, repair and manufacture. Forth Canoe Club became the birthplace of the company Double Dutch founded by Neil Baxter one of the clubs active members. One of the buildings at the Lochrin basin was named in memory of Jack Cuthill.

In 1975, extensive dredging was required as most of the union canal had become unusable due to the incredibly shallow water and deep mud. In part due to the Collapse of the mines under the canal at Lock Gate 19 now formally the Falkirk Wheel. The club&#x27;s Secretary, R.K Riddell at the time lead an entirely volunteer based dredging action in the Lochrin basin. Their willingness to re-spark the use of the canal became quite renown and as such over the course of the next 25 years thousands of volunteers joined in the effort clearing the canal from Edinburgh to Glasgow by hand, shovel and spade. The effort eventually resulted in a National Lottery (United Kingdom) Grant of £80 million to clear the Canal from Bowling to Falkirk

When the Union Canal was undergoing substantial redevelopment by British Waterways as part of the Millennium Link, Forth Canoe Club were required to relocate from the 4 buildings it owned beside the Lochrin basin in 2004, they were moved to the Old St Andrew&#x27;s Boathouse further along the canal adjacent to Harrison Park shrinking the clubs operational capacity by 3/4.

Forth Canoe Club member David Florence represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics as a member of the senior team. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing he won a silver medal in the men&#x27;s C1 single slalom event on 12 August 2008.

In 2024 the club celebrated its 90th anniversary by announcing its plans at a Fundraising Ceilidh at The Canalside venue, Meggetland to redevelop its clubhouse at Harrison park due to its age and the hostility of the site to a sport which could attract many people regardless of physical ability.

<text>Cusco, also spelled Cuzco (; ), is a department and region in Peru and is the fourth largest department in the country, after Madre de Dios, Ucayali, and Loreto. It borders the departments of Ucayali on the north; Madre de Dios and Puno on the east; Arequipa on the south; and Apurímac, Ayacucho and Junín on the west. Its capital is Cusco, the historical capital of the Inca Empire.

==Geography==
The plain of Anta contains some of the best communal cultivated lands of the Department of Cusco. It is located about above sea level and is used to cultivate mainly high altitude crops such as potatoes, tarwi (edible lupin), barley and quinoa.

==Provinces==
* Acomayo (Acomayo)
* Anta (Anta)
* Calca (Calca)
* Canas (Yanaoca) 
* Canchis (Sicuani)
* Chumbivilcas (Santo Tomás)
* Cusco (Cusco)
* Espinar (Yauri)

The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Department of Cusco by province:

== Toponyms ==
Many of the toponyms of the Department of Cusco originate from Quechua and also Aymara. These names are overwhelmingly predominant throughout the region. Their Spanish-based orthography, however, is in conflict with the normalised alphabets of these languages. According to Article 20 of &quot;Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC&quot; (Supreme Decree) which approves the Regulations to Law 29735, published in the official newspaper El Peruano on July 22, 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalised alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed with the aim of standardising the naming used by the National Geographic Institute The National Geographic Institute realises the necessary changes in the official maps of Peru.

The Ministry of Culture additionally proposes to the municipalities of the provinces to recover ancient indigenous toponyms and that these names should be spread by the local and communal authorities on posters and other signage.

<text>Huánuco () is a department and region in central Peru. It is bordered by the La Libertad, San Martín, Loreto and Ucayali regions in the north, the Ucayali Region in the east, the Pasco Region in the south and the Lima and Ancash regions in the west. Its capital is the city Huánuco.

Huánuco has a rough topography comprising parts of the Sierra and the High Jungle (mountain rim) regions. Being equidistant from the north and the south of the country, it has the privilege of having a mild weather with an average annual temperature of 20 °C (68 °F).

This region is important for its geographical location, history, and for the richness of its land, where the presence of man goes back to ancient times. &quot;El Hombre de Lauricocha&quot; (Man of Lauricocha) is among the most distinctive examples, dating from 10,000 BC, as well as Kotosh, where vestiges of the oldest settlement in the Americas (4200 BC) took place.

Several ethnic groups inhabited this region. However, after a severe resistance, they started to incorporate as part of the Inca empire. Huánuco then became part of the Cusco-Cajamarca-Cusco route.

In the beginning of the 19th century, during the emancipation process, Huánuco was one of the first cities to promote Peru&#x27;s independence. Moreover, a first oath took place in this city on December 15, 1820, after several uprisings in Huamalíes, Huallanca and Ambo.

==Political division==

The region is divided into 11 provinces (, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which are composed of 75 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;).

The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:

* Ambo (Ambo)
* Dos de Mayo (La Unión)
* Huacaybamba (Huacaybamba)
* Huamalíes (Llata)
* Huánuco (Huánuco)
* Lauricocha (Jesús)

<text>Ica (; ) is a department and region of Peru. It borders the Pacific Ocean on the west; the Lima Region on the north; the Huancavelica and Ayacucho regions on the east; and the Arequipa Region on the south. Its capital is the city of Ica.

==Geography==
The Department of Ica has a remarkable geography. It is the only region of the southern coast formed by plains, also called coast plains, since the Andean Cordillera rise up inland. Some geological folds have determined the formation of dunes moving toward the sea, which form much of the Paracas Peninsula. Some isolated formations located at the southern part created the Marcona complex, with the biggest deposits of iron in the Pacific coast.

Ica&#x27;s configuration is due to the geomorphology of its two big and unique fluvial watersheds: the Pasco and Ica rivers. Also, it has a waterway called the Rio Grande, although its waters do not reach the ocean. Some waters are diverted for irrigation and agriculture in the provinces of Palpa, Nazca and Ingenio; the Rio Grande&#x27;s final riverbed is dry since sand and dried lands absorb its limited resources. There are extensive deserts in Ica, such as the &quot;Lancha Pampas&quot;. &quot;Pozo Santo&quot; and &quot;Villacuri&quot; pampas are extremely hot areas. Strong and persistent winds called &quot;paracas&quot; are present and stir up large sandstorms.

==History==

Ica has a rich history. The first settlers are from 10,000 years ago, from which the Wari, Chincha, Nazca, Ica and Paracas cultures developed, the latter being the most important.

The Paracas culture developed from the seventh through the 2nd century BC. It is distinguished by its matchless textile skills, trephinations, and the art of mummifying their dead.

The Nazca culture, on the contrary, well known for its artistic pottery, in which colorful designs and representations excel over the form, the same as their lines and figures that have undergone implausible interpretations. This culture expanded from the 2nd century BC through the 7th century AD. They have left us their wonderful aqueducts that made good use of underground water, of rivers and rain, showing a great knowledge of hydraulic engineering.

In the 15th century, during the Inca Empire, Pachacuti incorporated the territories of Ica, Nazca and the Chincha valley.

Years later, in 1563, with the arrival of the Spanish, Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera founded the Villa de Valverde del Valle de Ica. Since then, the area became an important vineyard and cotton center.

During the independence war, General José de San Martín landed in Paracas and fixed his headquarters in Pisco, to start the fight for the independence of Peru.

==Political division==

The region is divided into five provinces (, singular: ), which are composed of 43 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;).

===Provinces===
The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:

*Chincha (Chincha Alta)
*Ica (Ica)
*Nazca (Nazca)
*Palpa (Palpa)
*Pisco (Pisco)

==Points of interest==

===City of Ica===
Capital of the Ica Department. A very modern clean city that has Peruvian street markets, many old churches and landmarks, modern malls, hotels, coffee shops, theatres, and hotels as well.

=== Huacachina===
Located on the west side of the city of Ica, capital of the Ica Department. One of the most popular places to visit in Ica is La Huacachina. The desert oasis is located from Ica. It is a small lake with medicinal water, lying in the middle of a spectacular sand desert.

===Pisco===
Pisco is the most important port in Ica and a litoral province. The most important attractions within this province are likely Paracas, Paracas Bay and the Paracas National Reserve. Pisco was home of an ancient pre-Hispanic culture, Paracas, who are known for their exquisite textiles.

===Paracas===
Paracas (a municipality within the Paracas District) is a small town catering to tourism. It serves as the jumping point for tours to Islas Ballestas and to Paracas National Reservation. Paracas Bay, protected by Paracas Peninsula, gives these shallow, warmer waters break from ocean waves permitting life to flourish, particularly near its south western edge encompassed within Paracas National Reserve. The Paracas Museum, also found just near the south western edge of Paracas Bay, provides excellent information about Paracas culture and the many unique species, in particular, the birds of Paracas.

===Nazca===
The Ica-Nazca culture flourished along the southern coast of Peru from around 200 BC to 600 AD. This area is extremely dry. The Nazca developed extensive irrigation systems, including underground canals, that allowed them to farm the land. The Nazca are known for their textiles and pottery which feature images of animals and mythological beings.

They are even better known, however, for a unique set of creations known as the Nazca Lines, which are geoglyphs and geometric line clearings in the Atacama desert, in the district of Nazca. On a large, rock-strewn plain, the Nazca made huge drawings by scraping away stones to reveal the lighter soil underneath. The drawings depict various plants and animals, including humans, a monkey, birds, and other creatures, as well as lines and geometric shapes. These drawings are so huge, however, that they can be seen only from the sky. Scientists believe that the Nazca made these drawings for their gods. The area of the Nazca lines is called the Pampa Colorada (red plain).

===Cachiche===
A small village near Ica, Cachiche is well known for its history of witches. Doña Julia, Cachiche&#x27;s first witch, was known to practice &quot;good magic,&quot; curing and helping villagers with her spells. Near the entrance to the town, a carving from a single huarango tree depicts this first &quot;bruja de Cachiche&quot; (witch of Cachiche).

==Tourism==
Ica has significant wine and pisco industries, annual fiestas, a museum and historic colonial churches. The climate is generally sunny and dry due to its elevation above coastal fog and mist. As of 2020, the Peruvian desert, around the Huacachina Oasis, has gotten significantly popular among tourists for sandboarding and sand buggy tours.

There is also a Regional Museum, which exhibits prehistoric artefacts as well as paintings and furniture that date back to the Spanish Colonial era. Moreover, in the museum, mummies with typical Paracas culture skulls can be found.

<doc id="713291" wikidata="Q125802158" url="?curid=713291" title="The New Warriors">
<text>The New Warriors is the name of several comic book titles featuring the team the New Warriors and published by Marvel Comics, beginning with the original &quot;The New Warriors&quot; comic book series which debuted in 1990.

The team made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #411 (December 1989) and made their full debut in &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot; #412. Over the years, the New Warriors, in their various incarnations, have been featured in five different volumes.

The first volume was a 75-issue comic series. The second volume of &quot;New Warriors&quot; was published in 1999–2000 and ran for 11 issues before being cancelled. The third volume of the &quot;New Warriors&quot; was a six-issue mini-series that sees the superhero team cast as the stars of their own reality TV show and ultimately led to Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover in 2006 and 2007. The fourth &quot;New Warriors&quot; series was published from 2007 to 2009 and lasted for 20 issues. The fifth &quot;New Warriors&quot; series was launched as part of the &quot;All-New Marvel NOW!&quot; initiative in 2014. The book lasted for 12 issues before being cancelled.

==Publication history==
===The New Warriors (vol. 1)===
The New Warriors first appeared in issues 411 and 412 of the Marvel Comics title &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot;. The team was compiled by writer/editor Tom DeFalco, consisting of the young superheroes Firestar, Marvel Boy, Namorita, Nova and Speedball, all of whom were once featured in solo series or were supporting characters in more established series. To this mix DeFalco added Night Thrasher, an original character to serve as the team&#x27;s founder and leader.

The New Warriors were featured in an eponymous series from 1990 until 1996, written by Fabian Nicieza with art by Mark Bagley. Nicieza wrote the series for the first 53 issues. The series lasted for 75 issues and four annuals, spinning off a number of titles, including mini-series featuring Night Thrasher and Marvel Boy (by then renamed Justice) and ongoing series with Nova and Night Thrasher.

===&quot;The New Warriors&quot; (vol. 2)===
A short-lived relaunch began in 1999 and ran for 11 issues. It was written by Jay Faerber and pencilled by a variety of artists, including Steve Scott (comics), Karl Kerschl and Jamal Igle. Faerber and Igle would go on to collaborate on several other projects. Original members Namorita, Nova, and Speedball were joined by returning member Turbo and new members Bolt and Aegis. The last was an all-new character, reminiscent of Night Thrasher. A promotional issue #0 was given away with &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot;.

===&quot;The New Warriors&quot; (vol. 3)===
A six issue mini-series of the title was released starting in June 2005, written by Zeb Wells and illustrated by Skottie Young. It features the team as the stars of a reality television show to fund their team. The line-up includes previous members Namorita, Night Thrasher, Nova and Speedball, along with one new character, Microbe. A second new character, Debrii, joins in issue 4. A trade paperback collection of all six issues was released in January 2006.

===&quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 4)===
A fourth series was launched in June 2007, spinning off of events in the &quot;Civil War&quot; crossover.

===&quot;New Warriors&quot; (vol. 5)===
&quot;New Warriors&quot; was launched in February 2014 as part of All-New Marvel NOW! with Chris Yost as the writer and Marcus To as the main artist. &quot;New Warriors&quot; Volume 5 ended with issue 12.

===&quot;New Warriors&quot; (2020, unreleased)===
Marvel Comics announced that on March 17, 2020, a new version of the team would appear, this time with new characters forming the New Warriors: Screentime, Snowflake, Safespace, B-Negative and Trailblazer. The direction of the new characters – particularly the use of pejorative internet slang in names as well as the perceived political agenda of the writing – was met with considerable backlash from online audiences.

As of 2024 no New Warriors comics have been released and the title has been removed from ComiXology with both Marvel and its creators refusing to comment on the future or cancellation of the comic. B-Negative did however make a cameo in &quot;Darkhold: Blade&quot;.

<text>The Union Canal, full name the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal, is a canal in Scotland, running from Falkirk to Edinburgh, constructed to bring minerals, especially coal, to the capital. It was opened in 1822 and was initially successful, but the construction of railways, particularly the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which opened in 1842, diminished its value as a transport medium. It fell into slow commercial decline and was closed to commercial traffic in 1933. It was officially closed in 1965. The canal is listed as three individual scheduled monuments by Historic Scotland according to the three former counties, Midlothian, West Lothian and Stirlingshire, through which it flows.

It has benefited from a general revival of interest in canals and, as a result of the Millennium Link, was reopened in 2001 and reconnected to the Forth and Clyde Canal in 2002 by the Falkirk Wheel. It is now in popular use for leisure purposes.

==History==
===Proposal===
The canal was conceived with the purpose of moving minerals from the mines and quarries in Lanarkshire to Edinburgh.
In 1817, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal Company obtained a local act of Parliament, the (57 Geo. 3. c. lvi) to start construction. Joseph Priestley described the purpose of the canal in his 1831 book &quot;Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals and Railways of Great Britain&quot;:



The estimate of cost was evidently inadequate because a second act of Parliament was obtained, the &#x27; (59 Geo. 3. c. xxix), which authorised the borrowing of £48,100, a third, the &#x27; (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. cxxii) authorised an increase in share capital of a further £50,000 and a fourth, the (4 Geo. 4. c. xviii) authorised a further £60,000.

However, when the Union Canal got its act of Parliament, the town of Linlithgow, along with Edinburgh, mounted a legal petition for compensation for any losses they would incur from the turnpike that ran between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Their writ read:

===Construction and design===

The Union Canal, which has a length of today, was built as a contour canal. This avoided building costs and future operational delays caused by the provision of locks but necessitated large aqueducts to cross river valleys. The canal operated between a junction with the Forth and Clyde Canal at Falkirk and Port Hopetoun basin in the centre of Edinburgh. The waterway, which was originally , follows a contour of above sea level throughout its entire length. Port Hopetoun was a basin between Semple Street and Lothian Road, and Morrison Street and Fountainbridge. However, the final mile has been filled in and the Edinburgh terminal is now at Lochrin Basin in Tollcross, adjacent to Fountainbridge.

The canal has several navigable aqueducts, including the Slateford Aqueduct that takes the canal over the Water of Leith in Edinburgh, the Almond Aqueduct near Ratho and the Avon Aqueduct near Linlithgow, the second-longest in the United Kingdom. Priestley describes the route and structures in some detail:

Many of the stone bridges have keystones on which is engraved the number of the bridge: the keystones of Viewforth bridge, the second bridge from the start of the canal at Edinburgh Quay, are emblazoned with the coats of arms of Glasgow and Edinburgh, facing west and east respectively.

The income from the project was derived from tolls, and charges for wharfage and so on. Maximum prices for these were laid down in the act of Parliament. The tolls were based on tonnage of the merchandise being conveyed; there was a toll for empty vessels, and this was to be remitted if the vessel returned laden within fourteen days.

===Closure and demise ===
In 1842 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened taking much of the traffic away from the canal with passenger traffic effectively disappearing. Although the waterway was still used to transport industrial minerals to Edinburgh, goods requiring more haste were put on to trains. The canal was acquired by the E&amp;GR in 1849 under the (12 &amp; 13 Vict. c. xxxix). Industrial traffic continued to use the waterway until after the First World War. However, with the closure of Port Hamilton and Port Hopetoun (the main basins in Edinburgh) in 1921, commercial traffic steadily declined with the western terminal closing in 1933. The canal continued to decline across the next three decades, with the abandoned flight of 11 locks at Falkirk, which connected the Union to the Forth and Clyde, being filled in. The canal was culverted for the Wester Hailes housing development in the western outskirts of Edinburgh and for the M8 motorway near Broxburn. Formal closure to navigation came in 1965 and throughout the 1970s and 1980s the remaining parts of the canal were left in a deteriorated state.

However, after a campaign was started by groups and local communities to improve the canal, work was carried out to restore the network during the 1990s. This culminated with the millennium project to reinstate the link between the Union Canal to the Forth and Clyde Canal with a boat lift called the Falkirk Wheel.

==Archaeology==


In 2004, an archaeological investigation by a team from Headland Archaeology uncovered the stern of a wooden barge. The vessel was discovered on the south bank of the canal between the Leamington Lift Bridge and Viewforth Bridge in Edinburgh. The remains represent the final berth of an early- to mid-19th-century canal barge or scow, a type of horse-drawn vessel that was the main freight carrier of the time. Typical cargoes included coal and lime from Lanarkshire, although there were a number of passenger carriers too; the actual function of this vessel is unknown. The vessel was dismantled and removed from the canal in order to record the techniques used in its construction. Additional work will seek to identify the species, age and provenance of the timbers.

==Millennium Link==

The Millennium Link was a project to restore a link between the Union and Forth and Clyde Canals at the Falkirk end. In 2002 the Falkirk Wheel opened reestablishing this historic connection. The scheme involved building a new stretch of canal, single and double locks and a short tunnel under the Edinburgh–Glasgow railway line and the Antonine Wall. Several new bridges were also built on the Millennium Link. As no CAD information was available on narrowboats, the motion of articulated lorries were used to design the bends of the bridge approaches.

==Leisure uses==

The canal is now used recreationally by canoeists at the Forth Canoe Club and rowers from schools and universities, such as St Andrew Boat Club, George Heriots School Rowing Club and George Watsons College Rowing Club. The Edinburgh Canal Society, the Bridge 19-40 Canal Society and Linlithgow Union Canal Society promote general use of the canal. They hire rowing boats and narrowboats, and they provide regular boat trips on the canal for the general public. Re-Union Canal Boats operate a social enterprise building and maintaining trip boats.

Scottish Canals (as successor to the British Waterways Board in Scotland) have redeveloped the area at the Edinburgh terminal; their publicity states:

Edinburgh Quay is a major regeneration project centred on the site of Lochrin Basin, in the heart of Scotland&#x27;s capital. It provides around 90 waterfront apartments, of offices and of retail and restaurant space.

Raft races have become an annual event, having been held in Edinburgh from 2007 to 2011, and using found &quot;junk&quot; material for the rafts. The Linlithgow Union Canal Society has been hosting its cardboard boat race for many years at Linlithgow Basin.

== 2020 Canal Breach ==
In the early morning of Wednesday the 12th of August 2020, slow-moving thunderstorms caused torrential rain over much of eastern Scotland, including in the Falkirk area. This heavy rainfall caused the Union Canal to overtop its embankment east of Polmont, producing a 30 metre wide breach in the canal. The floodwaters released from the breach caused significant damage to the main railway line from Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk High, Scotland&#x27;s busiest railway line.

<doc id="713315" wikidata="Q361931" url="?curid=713315" title="Noctis (video game)">
<text>Noctis (Latin for &quot;of the night&quot;) is a space flight simulation video game for Windows released in 2000 for free by Italian programmer Alessandro Ghignola. It centers around first-person visual exploration of the fictional Feltyrion galaxy, which is presented as being approximately 90 thousand light-years in radius—double that of the actual Milky Way Galaxy—and containing over 78 billion stars, many of which host star systems with exoplanets and natural satellites.

== Gameplay ==
The game has players take the role of a silent protagonist pilot operating a Stardrifter, a fictional spacecraft capable of instantaneous interstellar travel. This mode of transportation acts as a primary game mechanic wherein players may approach various star systems both to refuel their vehicle utilizing lithium ions ejected from stars, and to physically land their vehicle on exoplanetary surfaces—barring gas giants, substellar objects, and what the game identifies as unstable worlds—and then explore them. The explorable locales in the game feature a variety of procedurally-generated atmospheres, climates, flora, fauna, and ruins.

Players are not presented with a specified goal or win condition, and are instead encouraged to catalogue and annotate discoveries they make during gameplay. These notes are then stored in a common database of stellar bodies called the &quot;GUIDE&quot;, which was manually synchronized and made accessible by other players via updates. These &quot;GUIDE&quot; updates were originally provided manually by Ghignola, who regularly compiled new versions based on emailed submissions of players, and allowed the compilation to be downloaded using an in-game &quot;Inbox&quot; feature. Ghignola ceased making &quot;GUIDE&quot; updates from 2005 to 2008, before resuming the service. He last updated the &quot;GUIDE&quot; in October of 2023.

== Development==
Alessandro Ghignola began creating &quot;Noctis&quot; in 1996. &quot;Noctis&quot; versions I-IV were written in C and Assembly.

&quot;Noctis I&quot; through &quot;III&quot; (which were simply titled &quot;Noctis&quot; until the release of &quot;Noctis IV&quot;) are still available and contain features that were abandoned with later releases.

=== &quot;Noctis IV&quot;, &quot;NICE&quot; ===
&quot;Noctis&quot; was originally written for MS-DOS and uses a fixed display resolution of 320 x 200, and an upper limit imposed on the walking distance from a planetary landing site (this restriction does not necessarily limit the player&#x27;s ability to traverse the planet, as players may freely take off and land elsewhere to continue their exploration). These limitations do not apply to the Feltyrion galaxy itself.

The current version of the game is called Noctis IV. In the release of &quot;Noctis IV&quot;, Ghignola included a facility to have planet names and notes sent back to him and then compiled into the &quot;GUIDE&quot;. After that, players could discuss their discoveries with others, and a group of explorers quickly emerged, relying primarily on the Noctis forums for contact. This community often vied for a wide range of notable discoveries, such as the planetary system with the most planets or the biggest tree in the &quot;Noctis&quot; universe.

The source code for &quot;Noctis IV&quot; was released to the public in 2003 under the WTOF Public License, which has led to the creation of a fan-made &quot;mod&quot; to the game called &quot;Noctis IV CE&quot; (commonly abbreviated &quot;NICE&quot;). &quot;NICE&quot; includes bug fixes and additional features which increase the playability compared to &quot;Noctis IV&quot;. The terrain generation code has also been altered in the &quot;NICE&quot; version - this renders many remarks made in the &quot;GUIDE&quot; for &quot;Noctis IV&quot; largely invalid when used in &quot;NICE&quot;.

=== Linoleum ===
Linoleum was a low-level programming language created for work on Noctis V by Alessandro Ghignola. It was similar to programming languages like Python. It has been discontinued by its creator.

Alessandro shared his thoughts on Linoleum with the retro game site timeextension.com: &quot;[It was] perfectly fine for me, but honestly not that great anyway. In the end, after four versions, I stopped updating it since there were so many better alternatives out there, such as Python. I thought, why bother?&quot;

=== &quot;Noctis V (unreleased)&quot; ===
A future version of &quot;Noctis&quot; (tentatively named Noctis V or Noctis NoVa, sometimes abbreviated as NoVa) was under development as of October 11, 2001. &quot;Noctis V&quot; was not officially cancelled, but according to its creator, the project has been largely abandoned.

Key features of the game intended to relieve the walking distance restrictions of the current &quot;Noctis&quot; platform (as described above). The new version of &quot;Noctis&quot; was being developed in Linoleum, a low-level programming language created by Ghignola. Because &quot;Noctis&quot; and Linoleum were being constructed simultaneously, &quot;Noctis V&quot;&#x27;s development was slowed significantly.

Screenshots and details have been revealed by the developer indicating that the game&#x27;s rendering engine had been completely redone from scratch, first having attempted to simply translate the &quot;Noctis IV&quot; engine into Linoleum before giving up and rewriting it. Ghignola has also mentioned experimenting with weather and particle effects, possibly including weather such as snow and dust storms in the game.

Despite Ghignola reassuring fans multiple times that he would release &quot;Noctis V&quot;, according to a recent interview with him the project is largely abandoned.

In an interview with Videogame Potpourri on May 9, 2012, he stated &quot;[&quot;Noctis V&quot;] keeps living in a corner of my mind, on a sort of unwritten post-it note. But it&#x27;s there, ready to strike as soon as it gets an opportunity to incarnate.&quot;

== Reception ==
The game gained popularity in the early 2000s after receiving a very favorable review in Home of the Underdogs&#x27;s list of worthwhile free games. &quot;Noctis&quot; earned a score of 9.43 out of 10 as well as the site&#x27;s &quot;Top Dog&quot; award. The reviewer noted amongst other things the magnitude of the galaxy to explore and the total size of the simulator, which is less than five megabytes. An in-detail article by The Escapist&#x27;s Phillip Scuderi noted the philosophical depth of &quot;Noctis&quot; in 2006.

Around the release of action-adventure game &quot;No Man&#x27;s Sky&quot; in 2016, multiple outlets compared it to &quot;Noctis&quot;, noting that both games featured exploration of a large, procedurally-generated galaxy, and the ability to share discoveries with other players online. &quot;Noctis&quot; was described as having a distinct sense of strangeness and beauty, though being difficult to run on modern computers and with a cumbersome user interface.

<doc id="713334" wikidata="Q1093806" url="?curid=713334" title="Rocketdyne H-1">
<text>The Rocketdyne H-1 was a thrust liquid-propellant rocket engine burning LOX and RP-1. The H-1 was developed for use in the S-I and S-IB first stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets, respectively, where it was used in clusters of eight engines. After the Apollo program, surplus H-1 engines were rebranded and reworked as the Rocketdyne RS-27 engine with first usage on the Delta 2000 series in 1974. RS-27 engines continued to be used up until 1992 when the first version of the Delta II, Delta 6000, was retired. The RS-27A variant, boasting slightly upgraded performance, was also used on the later Delta II and Delta III rockets, with the former flying until 2018.

==History==

===Early engines===
The H-1 is one of a series of engines developed from the wartime V-2 ballistic missile. During the war, North American Aviation (NAA) was given several V-2 engines to examine and convert from metric to SAE measurements. They formed their &quot;Propulsion Division&quot; to handle this work, later becoming Rocketdyne.

NAA had also been given a wealth of technical documentation on the engine. Engineers studying them came across plans to improve the V-2 engine using a new &quot;waterfall&quot; fuel injector. The Germans were unable to get the design to work and it never went into service. NAA engineers decided to attack this problem and quickly came up with solutions. This allowed them to raise the thrust of the design to , and then for the Redstone missile.

NAA had also been working on the SM-64 Navaho cruise missile project, which used the same engine as a booster to get the missile up to speed so its ramjet engines could light. The Air Force continually demanded higher performance from the Navaho, which forced NAA to build larger missiles, and larger boosters to launch it. By the early 1950s, the basic engine design had been enlarged to produce .

All of these designs, like the V-2 that spawned them, burned ethanol, but other fuels had also been experimented with, including kerosene, diesel oil, paint thinner, JP-4, and JP-5 jet fuel. In January 1953 Rocketdyne started their &quot;REAP&quot; program to convert these engines to a specific and well-engineered kerosene fuel specifically for rocket engines, which became RP-1, officially specified in Military Specification MIL-R-25576 in 1954.

In 1955, the Air Force selected a JP-4 burning version of the engine to power their Atlas missile. The US Army requested a further boost to for their Jupiter missile, and the Air Force used the same version for their Thor, producing the Rocketdyne S-3D (or LR-79).

All of these engines were based on a similar design concept, featuring a &quot;waterfall injector&quot;, where many small fuel injectors were used to spray burning fuel into the main combustion chamber. They also shared a complex system for starting the turbopumps, using a set of secondary fuel tanks and plumbing that fed the gas generator and main combustors while the pumps were still bringing the main fuel lines up to pressure. A complex series of electropneumatic valves operated the various fuel flows until the engine was fully started.

===X-1===

With the successful running of the S-3D for the Thor and Jupiter, the company turned their attention to a radically updated version, originally known as the S-3X, but later becoming the X-1. This engine replaced the complex valve system and all of its attended sensors and electronics with new valves that operated on the pressure of the fuel itself. This meant that the complex start-up procedure was entirely automated and driven off the fuel flow itself.

Additionally, the X-1 removed the entire start tank system and replaced it with a small solid fuel rocket engine that fed its exhaust through the gas generator to spin the turbopumps. This change dramatically simplified engine plumbing, at the cost of making the design a single-shot device. Earlier engines could, in theory, be restarted in flight, but with a single starter cartridge, the X-1 could be started once only.

Another change was to introduce an ignitor using a pyrophoric fuel in place of the solid fuel versions of earlier designs. The earlier engines required the ignitors to be inserted through holes in the engine into the combustion chamber, but the new system allowed the fuel to be sprayed into the main injector. The fuel, triethylaluminum, was delivered in a cube with diaphragms that burst when the fuel flow in the injector reached a set threshold.

Finally, the X-1 introduced a new lubrication system that added a small amount of additive to the RP-1 fuel as it flowed through the various components. This was fed under pressure into the various bearings in the turbopump system, both lubricating it and carrying away heat.

===Saturn and H-1===
Saturn started as a paper project to meet a new US Department of Defense requirement for a heavy-lift vehicle able to lift 10,000 to 40,000 pounds into low Earth orbit (LEO), or accelerating 6,000 to 12,000 lb to escape velocity. Existing launchers might be extended to reach 10,000 lb to LEO, below the requirements. A new and larger design was needed, and in April 1957, Wernher von Braun handed the preliminary design task to Heinz-Hermann Koelle.

Koelle&#x27;s solution to reducing the development time was to use a cluster of fuel tanks from Redstone and Jupiter missiles, sit them on top of a single thrust plate, and then attach the required engines to the bottom of the plate. Calculations demonstrated that a total thrust of about 1 million pounds would be needed, greatly limiting their engine selection. Looking for suitable designs, Koelle learned of the E-1 from Rocketdyne&#x27;s George Sutton. Rocketdyne was developing this engine for the Titan missile, and it was the largest engine nearing introduction within the time frame that ARPA gave Wernher von Braun to develop what was then known as the &quot;Juno V&quot;. The E-1 had originally been developed as a backup engine for the Titan missile, designed specifically to be as simple to develop as possible, in case the Aerojet General LR-87 did not pan out.

The launch of Sputnik that October led to rapid changes in the US rocketry establishment. In order to demonstrate peaceful intent, the US decided to spin out its various non-military rocketry programs to a new agency, which would evolve as NASA. As the Army had lost interest in large rockets, they agreed to turn over von Braun&#x27;s ABMA team to NASA, becoming the Marshall Space Flight Center. The handover would take place in 1960.

Shortly after these plans were made, in July 1958 ARPA visited ABMA and told von Braun that they still had $10 million in their budget to spend before the handover, and asked if there was any way to effectively use the money. Von Braun called in Koelle and showed them a model of the Juno V, but the ARPA visitors noted that the E-1 engine wouldn&#x27;t be ready by 1960. Brainstorming, they decided that the best approach was to make a minor upgrade to Rocketdyne&#x27;s existing S-3D engines to boost them from to , and use eight of these engines instead of four E-1s.

When Koelle returned to Rocketdyne looking for an upgraded version of the S-3D, they instead presented the X-1 and suggested it be used in place of a further upgrade to the S-3. Although experimental, the X-1 was already in the right thrust range and ready for full development. A contract for development was tendered on 15 August 1958, and by early 1959 the name had changed from Juno to Saturn, referring to the succession as the planet after Jupiter, the Jupiter missile being the previous ABMA design.

==Description==

Like all of Rocketdyne&#x27;s early engines, the H-1 used a waterfall injector fed by turbopumps and regeneratively cooled the engine using the engine&#x27;s fuel. The combustion chamber was made of 292 stainless steel tubes brazed in a furnace.

Unlike the J-2 engine used on the S-IVB stage, the H-1 was a single-start engine. It could be fired multiple times—and engines were usually subject to two or more static test firings before a mission to flight-qualify them—but it could not be restarted in flight, because some components required for the startup sequence were non-reusable. In particular, the turbopumps were initially driven by a Solid Propellant Gas Generator (SPGG), which was essentially a small solid rocket and had to be replaced after each firing.

To start the engine a 500V AC voltage was applied to the SPGG, which ignited the solid propellant. This produced hot gas which was allowed to build up until reaching a pressure of 600–700 psi, after which a bursting diaphragm released it into the turbine which drove the fuel turbopumps. This began the process of pumping fuel and oxidizer into the gas generator and the engine, and the hot gases from the SPGG provided the initial energy required to ignite the fuel/oxidizer mix. This started the turbopumps spinning. Once RP-1 and LOX started burning in the gas generator, the exhaust powered the turbopumps until engine shutdown.

<text>Thomas Todd Manning is a fictional character from the American daytime drama &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (&quot;OLTL&quot;). Created by writers Michael Malone and Josh Griffith, the role was originated in 1993 by actor Roger Howarth. Todd was a college student and fraternity brother to Kevin Buchanan, Zach Rosen, and Powell Lord. In 1993, following a storyline in which he becomes acquainted with Marty Saybrooke, he initiates a gang rape on her with the help of Zach and Powell. The storyline was considered groundbreaking by television critics. Its main players—Howarth, Susan Haskell (Marty), and Hillary B. Smith (Todd&#x27;s lawyer Nora Hanen)—won Emmys in 1994, as did Malone and his writing team. Howarth left the role in 2003; it was recast with Trevor St. John, physically altered by plastic surgery. In 2011, Howarth returned to &quot;OLTL&quot;; it was disclosed Todd had been taken hostage and St. John&#x27;s version of the character was really Todd&#x27;s identical twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr., conditioned to assume Todd&#x27;s place.

Todd was initially a short-term villain, but his popularity with the audience and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him an integral part of &quot;OLTL&quot; canvas, despite Howarth&#x27;s objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd&#x27;s development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.

The drive to redeem Todd eventually drew Howarth, who always saw Todd as a villain, to leave the show for a year; he was uncomfortable with the redemption storyline and with many fans&#x27; positive reactions to Todd. Recasting Todd years later with St. John was generally considered successful by viewers and critics. St. John, instead of imitating Howarth&#x27;s portrayal, brought his own spin to the character. After &quot;OLTL&quot; cancellation in 2012, Howarth brought Todd to &quot;General Hospital&quot; (&quot;GH&quot;), but returned, along with St. John as Victor Jr., to the online version of &quot;OLTL&quot; in 2013, which was cancelled after one year.

Todd has been the subject of numerous soap opera articles, feminist studies, and inspired the creation of a doll in his likeness. He has remained a popular and controversial figure since his creation, and is considered one of soap opera&#x27;s breakout characters.

==Storylines==
=== 1993–2003 ===

In 1993, Todd, a defensive back for Llanview, Pennsylvania University&#x27;s football team, has a one-night stand with Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell), a . After she tutors him for a calculus exam and he fails it, which results in him getting suspended from the football team, he blames her. In March 1993, Todd and his fraternity brothers, Zach Rosen and Powell Lord, rape Marty in Kevin&#x27;s dorm room. Todd hires attorney Nora Hanen (Hillary B. Smith), who believes in his innocence until a woman named Carol Swift reveals Todd also raped her; Nora causes a mistrial. Todd continues to torment Marty, including by attempting to rape her for a second time, but she eventually tricks Todd into confessing, sending him, Zach and Powell to prison. Per Marty&#x27;s testimony that Powell, who was peer pressured into raping her, is remorseful, Powell receives a lighter sentence (one year with the possibility of parole in three months to Todd and Zach&#x27;s eight years with the possibility of parole in four years). This spurs on Todd&#x27;s need for revenge. While in prison, he befriends Rebecca Lewis (Reiko Aylesworth) and attends counseling sessions. Todd and Rebecca develop romantic feelings for each other, and Todd convinces Rebecca to help him escape prison. He is stabbed in the chest with a pair of scissors by Nora when he goes after her for revenge. Officer Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods), Nora&#x27;s love interest, rescues her from Todd. The two fight, but Todd escapes. In hiding, he is discovered by Marty and her boyfriend, Suede Pruitt. After accidentally killing Suede when they fight, he is shot by Bo; Todd falls into the Llantano River, and is presumed dead.

Todd survives and hides at Llanfair, where he befriends two children, C. J. and Sarah Roberts. He is arrested when he jealously confronts new couple Rebecca and Powell. His prison van gets into an accident with another vehicle, and he rescues Marty, C. J. and Jessica (Erin Torpey) from the car. This results in an early parole for Todd, but he continues to seek counseling. He is later accused of rape by several women. Marty reluctantly provides him with an alibi for one of the attacks. A deranged Powell, believing Todd is in his head, is later revealed as the serial rapist and kidnaps Rebecca. When Todd confronts him, making it so that Rebecca can escape, he kidnaps Todd and makes Todd feel the way Marty felt when they raped her. Todd proceeds to overpower Powell. After Powell is caught and arrested, Todd apologizes to Marty for all the pain he caused her, recognizing that he &quot;was a monster.&quot; He begins falling in love with Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) after meeting her in a bar. In December 1994, Peter Manning dies and Todd learns he is adopted. Conman David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) discovers Todd&#x27;s biological parents, Victor Lord and Irene Manning. With help from Todd&#x27;s scheming biological sister, Tina, David claims to be the lost Lord heir, but Todd&#x27;s true parentage is ultimately revealed, leaving Todd $27.8 million richer. He purchases The National Intruder, a tabloid paper from Dorian Lord (Robin Strasser) and relaunches it as &quot;The Sun&quot;, a direct rival to his new-found family&#x27;s newspaper &quot;The Banner&quot;. In 1995, Blair tricks Todd into marriage by faking a pregnancy. She later learns that she really is pregnant, but, after being mugged, she miscarries. Todd discovers she initially lied about her pregnancy and has the marriage annulled. When Blair becomes pregnant again, they remarry in November 1995. Although they are happy, Blair dislikes Todd&#x27;s consistent concern for Marty. He goes to Ireland to give Marty a flight back to Llanview. Her friend, Patrick Thornhart (Thorsten Kaye), is being hunted by Irish terrorists. Todd poses as Patrick, is shot, and presumed dead. Blair blames Marty. Todd returns to Llanview in 1996, to find Blair in bed with Patrick. His sister, Victoria &quot;Viki&quot; Lord (Erika Slezak), introduces him to his daughter, Starr (Kristen Alderson). Todd eventually resumes his life with Blair. They have many difficulties in their marriage, and Starr being diagnosed with aplastic anemia strains the marriage further. 

Blair is pregnant with Patrick&#x27;s baby, who has been identified as a donor match for Starr. She gives birth to his stillborn son in 1997. Todd blames Patrick for the miscarriage and frames him for the murder of billionaire and Llanview newcomer Guy Armitage. Blair learns that Todd caused the explosion that killed Guy, and divorces him in June. When Blair falls into a coma, Todd pays lawyer Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano) five million dollars to marry him so he can keep custody of Starr. When Blair awakens, he allows Blair visitation. In 1998, while Todd and Téa grow closer, Todd is again accused of rape; Blair and Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne), a lawyer and father-figure to Todd, help prove his innocence. Back in town upon Todd&#x27;s request, he also intends to help Todd save his tempestuous marriage to Téa. In the interim, Todd and Blair grow closer, and Blair and Téa vie for Todd&#x27;s affections. As Todd and Téa fall in love, Blair moves on with Sam. When Todd is about to be arrested for the murder of a woman named Georgie Phillips, he takes the other fourteen suspects hostage at the Buchanan family cabin with fake dynamite strapped to his chest. Rachel Gannon admits to the murder, but Todd is arrested for the hostage incident. He fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid conviction and keep Téa in his life. Téa divorces him as part of his defense strategy, but they remarry in November. During the reception, a tape on which Todd confesses to faking his split personalities is accidentally played at Starr&#x27;s request. Téa refuses his offer of another five million to stay married to him. He leaves town in December, and Tea has the marriage annulled in 1999.

In 2000, Todd keeps tabs on Téa, who starts dating Rachel&#x27;s uncle, R. J. (Timothy Stickney). Out of jealousy, he almost kills R. J. via a gunshot, and reveals himself to Téa, convincing her to leave town with him. When Téa dumps him, he returns months later without her. Todd and Blair grow close again. By framing Skye Chandler (Robin Christopher), he helps her cover up her rage-shooting of Max Holden (James DePaiva). They decide to remarry, but the night before the wedding, a vengeful Max drugs Blair and leads Todd to believe they had sex. A furious Todd exposes Blair as Max&#x27;s shooter. After burying Max alive to discover the truth, and soon afterward releasing him, he helps Blair stay out of jail by claiming she suffered a psychotic break. She is committed against her will. Months later, she goes to Mexico, knowing that she is pregnant with Todd&#x27;s child. Todd follows, where he delivers their son. Believing the child is Max&#x27;s, he gives the baby to David Vickers, and lets Blair think the baby died and was cremated soon afterward. During her grief, she and Todd reconcile, and she finally tells Todd that the child was really his. Todd locates the infant and claims the boy was abandoned. Blair subsequently believes the child is a stranger. In December 2001, Todd convinces Blair to remarry him. They name their son John &quot;Jack&quot; Cramer Manning, and Todd makes it appear they have adopted him.

Jack develops aplastic anemia like Starr. This ultimately leads Sam to deduce that they are biological siblings, and to inform Blair that Jack is her biological son. She angrily confronts Todd. When he admits that he gave Jack away and forced her to grieve for a child that was never dead, she classifies his existence as worthless and bans him from her life, which results in him being severely emotionally unstable. Blair leaves town with the children, but Todd follows her to Hawaii, where his plans to kidnap the children with help from Ross Rayburn (Shawn Christian) are foiled by Téa. Todd and Téa make love when they get stranded together on an island with Ross. Todd escapes to return to Blair, and protects her when the Mafia comes after her because of her exposé on them in &quot;The Sun.&quot; As Todd and Blair are about to remarry, Sam discloses that Todd, in an effort to win Blair&#x27;s affections, staged a hit on their nanny, who had been presumed dead as a result of the Mafia&#x27;s retaliation. Todd had used the nanny&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; as an excuse for Blair to stay with him, later staging a hit on Blair&#x27;s life, with him as the rescuer. The wedding is called off, and Blair distances herself from Todd. Soon afterward, Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born) kidnaps Starr. Blair exchanges her own life for her daughter&#x27;s. Todd rescues Blair by kidnapping his niece, Natalie (Melissa Archer), and exchanging her life for Blair&#x27;s. Mitch, working for the presumed dead Victor Lord, intends to steal a descendant&#x27;s heart so he can live. Natalie is rescued, and Todd comes face to face with a frail Victor before he finally dies from heart failure. Mitch kidnaps Todd and locks him in Victor&#x27;s crypt in order to frame him for Sam Rappaport&#x27;s murder. Todd disappears from the crypt, and Blair eventually has him declared dead.

=== 2011–2013===
Todd&#x27;s identical twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), whom he had never known, is physically altered and brainwashed to believe that he is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd&#x27;s identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd&#x27;s scar, but then had Victor&#x27;s face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence&#x27;s long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd&#x27;s place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.&#x27;s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor&#x27;s fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa&#x27;s brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene&#x27;s murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor&#x27;s murder.

In 2012, Todd jumps bail and arrives in Port Charles upon learning that Starr has been involved in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge. The charges against him for Victor&#x27;s murder are dropped, due to a claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following his years in captivity, but Starr faces attempted murder charges for trying to kill Sonny. A pregnant Téa, who has been sought out by Blair to represent Starr, gets the charges dropped. In June, Todd is with Téa during an intense rainstorm when she goes into labor and gives birth to an unresponsive baby boy. Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) is also giving birth to a baby boy in a motel room. After Todd, searching for help, comes upon Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) in a shack, and she tells Todd that Téa&#x27;s baby has died, he comes across Sam&#x27;s son. An elated Téa sees the child and believes he is hers. Todd allows Téa to believe the child is hers, after Heather talks him out of telling Téa the truth. Todd forms a close relationship with Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright), Sonny&#x27;s former wife, in the wake of yet another rejection from Blair, who is set to marry Tomás. Todd&#x27;s role in the baby switch is eventually revealed. To make amends for almost killing her son, Steven, Heather lies to the judge and prosecutors about Todd&#x27;s role in switching the babies. He is then released.

In 2013, Todd returns to Llanview to check on Dani, who had previously phoned him several times. He witnesses Dani collapse from a drug overdose due to her abuse of oxycodone. While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding the best way to win them over is to call a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair&#x27;s affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false sense of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd&#x27;s scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated. Todd says goodbye to Viki and his children, but does not tell them the real reason he is leaving is to protect their family. Before Todd leaves, he and Blair make love one last time, and it is revealed that they have remarried.

==Creation and development==
===Background===
Todd was originally intended to be a short-lived role, but Howarth&#x27;s portrayal of the character inspired notable fan reaction, which prompted the creators to layer Todd&#x27;s personality and showcase him regularly within the series. Michael Malone, Todd&#x27;s creator, said fleshing out the character reminded him of what he loved about soap operas, adding, &quot;The story-telling is a genuine collaboration, not just among writers but by the actors.&quot; Malone felt he could not take full credit for the development of Todd from Marty Saybrooke&#x27;s gang rapist to what he later became, and also noted Howarth&#x27;s impact:

In the creation of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head writer, during my stay at &quot;One Life&quot;. Josh loved, lived and breathed Todd and fought passionately for his position on the show. Second, Todd never would have evolved from &quot;first frat boy&quot; to the major cast member he became without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger&#x27;s ability to convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) and at the same time slowly uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These characters appeal because they make women feel both the thrill of the &quot;bad&quot; and the lure of the hidden &quot;good&quot;: they can lead the man to change through love. &quot;I&#x27;ll save him!&quot; Fans loved Todd from the beginning because he always had that appeal.

Malone originally scripted Todd as a serial rapist. As part of the 1993 rape storyline, it was disclosed that Todd raped a woman named Carol Swift, a year or two before raping Marty, and that there were hints he raped other young women before Carol. Howarth considered Todd&#x27;s rationale for raping Marty to be complex. &quot;Todd was in love with Marty,&quot; he said. When Marty rejects Todd&#x27;s romantic advances after their one-night stand, it is because he was cold to her that same night after they had sex. Marty&#x27;s rejection upsets Todd and it festers. When he fails an exam after she tutors him, he blames her for the failure and begins attributing her as the reason for his problems. Howarth called Todd &quot;privileged and very rich&quot;. Because Todd was used to getting what he wanted, he did not know how to cope with Marty rejecting him.

Although Todd is the product of an affair between Victor Lord and Irene Manning, Malone gave him the last name &quot;Manning&quot; without knowing the name of Victor&#x27;s mistress, an oversight that allowed the writers to later reveal him as Tina and Victoria Lord&#x27;s brother. He is at first presented as 18 years old, but over the years, his age has been changed based upon the occasional rapid aging of his children. Malone stated that making Todd heir to the Lord fortune gave the writers &quot;huge story&quot; that helped Howarth&#x27;s character evolve from a short-term role to a major cast member, which Malone attributed to Howarth&#x27;s &quot;powerful talent&quot;. Peter Manning, who Todd thought was his father, had died; Todd receives letters written by his adoptive mother disclosing that he is the Lord heir, and worth almost $30 million. Developing Todd not only as Victoria&#x27;s unwanted sibling, whom she was horrified to discover was her blood, but as &quot;her professional rival&quot; who used &quot;a splashy tabloid newspaper to wipe out her venerable&quot; newspaper &quot;The Banner&quot; appealed to Malone.

Executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan, when speaking of Todd&#x27;s psychological motivations, reported that Peter Manning degraded him verbally and abused his adoptive mother, whom Todd loved but who abandoned and disappointed him, leaving Todd with wounds that influenced his later behavior. Author Gerry Waggett stated that Peter Manning had physically abused Todd his entire life.

===Signature scar, hair and facial cues===
In late 1993, in order to make Todd look more menacing, he was given a scar to his right cheek by Marty&#x27;s friend, Luna Moody, when she hit him in his face with a crowbar while preventing his attempt to rape Marty for a second time. The camera would often close in on and emphasize Todd&#x27;s scar, which later became synonymous with the character.

To casting director Howard Meltzer, &quot;Todd wears the scar like a badge. It&#x27;s a warning to others: Don&#x27;t mess with me.&quot; Meltzer felt Howarth underplayed Todd; Todd did not have to rant to incite fear. Meltzer added: &quot;He gets a lot more from the raising of an eyebrow than raising the volume of his voice. Most of Todd&#x27;s performance is reacting to the environment around him, and thanks to Howarth&#x27;s expressiveness, viewers can see the wheels turning.&quot; The scar also served to remind Todd of his past villainy against Marty. It was applied by glue, with a little makeup to make it look more authentic, and usually took ten minutes to apply.

Todd&#x27;s long hair was also integral to the character. It was described by &quot;Soap Opera Magazine&quot; as &quot;enigmatic, with an air of innate authority&quot;. The hair was said to demonstrate Todd&#x27;s lack of pretense and to convey an &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot; attitude. Todd&#x27;s &quot;overhanging brow&quot; seemed threatening, but instead concealed the &quot;intense, vulnerable eyes underneath&quot;, features that contrasted well with the character&#x27;s &quot;pouty, sensual mouth&quot;. The features, which conferred &quot;a charming, boyish quality&quot;, could sometimes convey that Todd was less dangerous than he actually was. Photographer Robert Milazzo believed Howarth&#x27;s hair softened Todd&#x27;s character. &quot;You don&#x27;t expect that intensity because of it,&quot; he said, and felt that it made Todd more intriguing. Milazzo also stated that the combination of Todd&#x27;s soft hair and intensity made Todd &quot;a very complex character to look at&quot;.

An interviewer concluded that Howarth was physically attractive and that this may have contributed to the character&#x27;s magnetism. Howarth replied, &quot;I know what the convention of a good-looking person is, and I know that for some reason skinny white guys are big now. I guess you could blame it on that.&quot;

In November 2008, during St. John&#x27;s portrayal of the character, Todd is given a new scar by John McBain during a physical altercation in which John beats Todd with a gun. The scar symbolized Todd&#x27;s &quot;second rape of Marty&quot;, and was considered &quot;a poetic nod&quot; to Todd&#x27;s history. The scar was significantly smaller than the original but placed in the same spot; it was gone by January 2009. St. John stated, &quot;I know. It&#x27;s too bad. I honestly have no idea why they wouldn&#x27;t keep that reminder on Todd&#x27;s face. It might be an economical thing. You know it costs to apply that kind of makeup each day.&quot;

The most important aspect of Todd&#x27;s appearance for St. John was his character&#x27;s hair. His preference was that Todd&#x27;s hair was a little shorter; he told &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; (&quot;SOW&quot;) that he thought that Todd&#x27;s hair was too &quot;shaggy&quot;, which was not his personal style, and that he hoped the writers and producers would let him trim off a bit. When he first got the role, St. John&#x27;s hair resembled Howarth&#x27;s shorter chin-length haircut, which was initially worn from 2000 to 2003, and St. John was told by the writers and producers not to change his hair until further notice. St. John &quot;made the creative choice [to let himself] go because [Todd&#x27;s] not really right in the old noggin, and gained weight for the role.

===&quot;Todd&#x27;s theme&quot; and related music===

&quot;One Life to Live&#x27;s&quot; producers stated that most of the show&#x27;s music was custom written, suitable for the situation and what the characters in the scene might actually play. For Todd, his volatile nature was represented with powerfully dark theme music, which producers and fans called the &quot;Todd theme&quot;. The music consisted of ominous low chords and signaled that Todd was about to commit a vicious, dangerous, or threatening act.

Composer David Nichtern, who created Todd&#x27;s theme music, said he loved the character and enjoyed implementing the different versions of the Todd theme. While describing the music that marked Todd&#x27;s prominent 1996 &quot;return from the dead&quot; storyline (which documented his return to town after being presumed dead), Nichtern addressed the broader aspect of his composition for the character: &quot;All of Todd&#x27;s music has had a certain &#x27;vibe&#x27; to it, especially since the character is so well-drawn,&quot; he stated. &quot;It also has seemed particularly well-suited to my guitar style, so I&#x27;ve enjoyed &#x27;becoming&#x27; Todd musically. The key is always to represent his dark side, but with the possibility of redemption and power behind the whole thing.&quot; Nichtern added, &quot;That&#x27;s what makes him such an interesting character. Todd&#x27;s cues are always custom-made so to speak, so there is energy and attention going toward getting the exact flavor of what the current story-line is saying about his journey.&quot;

Three primary musical themes were played throughout Todd&#x27;s evolution. The original Todd theme, from 1993 to 1996, encompassed Todd&#x27;s rape of Marty and his early misdeeds. The second theme was heard throughout 1998 and 2000, and the third theme was first heard in 2001. The Todd and Marty rape scene was aided primarily by rock songs. Heard at a low volume in the background, hard rock songs assist moments building up to the rape; they intensify the otherwise implicitly tense, aggressive atmosphere, and set a chilling tone for viewers. When Todd is certain that he will rape Marty, right before going upstairs to Kevin&#x27;s room where she rests, the volume of a song in the background (&quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;) is increased, which emphasizes the lyrics: &quot;I&#x27;d rather die/Than give you control.&quot; This use of background music allowed Todd&#x27;s motivation for the rape to significantly register with viewers.

The menacing chords which played as Todd stalked and terrorized Nora in 1993 for mishandling his trial and sending him to prison were Todd&#x27;s theme. There have been additional musical themes for Todd; for example, during his romance with Rebecca in 1994, an all-encompassing romantic theme with tragic nuances, which was at times intermixed with his ominous music, were heard. His rescue of Marty and two children from a car crash, and the Todd and Téa romance, also have their own musical themes. For the mid-1994 plot point where Todd rescues Marty and the children, the music was changed to reflect his decision to be a better person. It becomes his dominant theme, and is assisted by a tuneful, forward-moving melody. This music is primarily a part of Todd&#x27;s 1994 redemption storyline and the storyline when he is the Lord heir in 1995. According to Nichtern, the music for Todd and Teá, which he composed with his friend keyboardist Kevin Bents, was &quot;as close as we get to Todd &#x27;romantic&#x27; music&quot;, with &quot;the possibility of a little sensuality and romance&quot;.

For the &quot;Todd returns from the dead&quot; 1996 storyline, demented-sounding, on-edge music signifies that Todd&#x27;s psyche has worsened. This theme accompanied Todd&#x27;s emotional breakdown and revenge scheme after discovering his wife, Blair, having sex with Patrick.

==Personality==
At the time of Todd&#x27;s introduction to &quot;OLTL&quot;, he was a competitive athlete. His fraternity was the most important part of his life; Howarth stated that Todd was &quot;under intense pressure from the male figures in his life&quot;. He felt that the key to understanding Todd was his concern about his status and how others perceived him. He thought that Todd mistreated people because it made him feel better about himself and that he did not want to appear vulnerable, so his defense mechanisms &quot;spun out of control&quot;. Howarth, during an April 1994 &quot;Soap Opera Update&quot; interview, said that the only thing that he admired about Todd was his clothing style. His interviewer called Todd&#x27;s early fashion sense &quot;grunge, Salvation Army like &#x27;rags&#x27;,&quot; and Howarth described Todd&#x27;s later wardrobe as &quot;all Ralph Lauren&quot; and &quot;[d]ouble R.L. 80 dollar pants and a 400-and-something-dollar jacket&quot;. St. John, as Todd&#x27;s second portrayer, described the character as &quot;kind of both good and bad. He&#x27;s got his good side with his kids, and yet he is conniving and vicious and all those negative things&quot;.

The show&#x27;s writers presented Todd&#x27;s personality as a combination of dark humor, uncouth behavior, and the essence of a tortured soul; he often delivers one-liners that range from humorous to sadistic. Soap opera columnist Jenn Bishop stated that Todd&#x27;s personality is &quot;violent, gentle, caring, apathetic, smart, obsessive, crazy, irrational, devilish, heroic, angst-filled, comical, etc.&quot; and that &quot;[he] loves, but he feels he&#x27;s unworthy of true love because of the things he&#x27;s done. He doesn&#x27;t love himself and projects a facade of a confident, arrogant playboy, but underneath it all, he&#x27;s someone who seeks an unattainable love&quot;. Columnist Jill Berry, who saw Todd as self-centered in the extreme, said that although Todd desperately wants to be loved, he is unable to give or receive it, and when he is loved, he will destroy it. She did acknowledge Todd&#x27;s capability of loving his children, which he expressed by doing &quot;crazy and illegal things to prove it&quot;, but felt that much of the difficulty he experiences is brought on by himself and that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes even when they hurt the people he loves. She said Todd is in need of &quot;intensive therapy&quot;, which will never work because he refuses to change. For example, as portrayed by St. John in 2006, he fights for the custody of his son, Sam, but he is motivated by anger that he has been lied to and revenge more than by a desire to recover his child.

For several years on the series, a defining characteristic of Todd&#x27;s personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped him when he was fourteen. It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a near-death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd&#x27;s fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, Téa. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked in front of him and pleading with him to make love to her, he rejects her, explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of a snowstorm.

Bishop stated, &quot;Though viewers were given an explanation for his repulsive actions (lots and lots of childhood trauma), his crime was never excused or glossed over. Todd began to care for people – Rebecca, then Blair and later Téa – something missing in his earlier sociopathic characteristics.&quot; Soap opera commentator Kaydee Barnett stated that Todd&#x27;s dark edges had been softened over a period of many years by Blair, Viki, and Starr. Todd&#x27;s deep love for his sister, Viki, was partly demonstrated by him supporting her during her battle with cancer, her difficulties with her daughter and his niece, Jessica, and by defending Viki to her enemies. Berry enjoyed the vulnerability Viki brought out of Todd, and felt that his self-hatred demonstrated itself in many ways, including when he refused to name his son, Jack, after himself because his name carried too much baggage.

In the 1998 storyline where he fakes dissociative identity disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities may not have been as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.

==Casting and portrayals==
===General===
Following Howarth&#x27;s 1992 casting as Todd Manning, he occasionally vacated the role. His 2003 departure was his longest absence from &quot;OLTL; &quot;he did not return to the series until 2011. Todd was recast in 2003 with St. John, and Howarth joined &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as Paul Ryan until it was cancelled in 2010. Malone stated that because of Todd&#x27;s appeal, which he credited to Howarth, &quot;The network was therefore happy to have him return to Llanview whenever Roger would come back, and happy to have him move into story in major ways.&quot; In April 2011, after several months of speculation, &quot;OLTL&quot; confirmed Howarth&#x27;s return, although it was unclear if he would portray Todd Manning. He stated, &quot;I am looking forward to returning to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;&quot;. Executive producer Frank Valentini said, &quot;We are thrilled to have Roger return to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;&quot;. It was eventually revealed that St. John&#x27;s version of the character was really Victor Lord, Jr., Todd&#x27;s twin brother, conditioned to believe that he was Todd and assume Todd&#x27;s identity, while the real Todd (Howarth) was held hostage for eight years.

&quot;OLTL&quot; was cancelled in early 2012; Howarth brought Todd to &quot;General Hospital&quot; (&quot;GH&quot;), along with his co-stars Kristen Alderson as Starr and Michael Easton as John McBain. All three actors were forced to briefly leave &quot;GH &quot;when Prospect Park, the company that bought the rights to &quot;OLTL &quot;and aired an online version of the show in 2013, sued ABC for breach of contract. Prospect Park argued that ABC sabotaged its efforts by killing off two characters, Starr&#x27;s boyfriend Cole and her young daughter Hope. Both St. John and Howarth appeared on the online version as Victor and Todd, but the suit prevented ABC from continuing to feature Howarth, Alderson, and Easton&quot; &quot;as their original characters on &quot;GH; &quot;ABC&#x27;s solution was to create new characters for the actors. The online version of &quot;OLTL &quot;was cancelled after one season.

===Howarth===
Malone credited Howarth&#x27;s versatility with the reason he was cast as Todd. During a February 1993 interview with &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; (&quot;SOD&quot;), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. &quot;I really don&#x27;t know how I made it,&quot; he said. He met a &quot;One Life to Live&quot; casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he &quot;auditioned just like everybody else&quot;. He &quot;made it to callbacks, and [he] got the part&quot;. Howarth said, &quot;I was hired ... to plant drugs in Jason Webb&#x27;s jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don&#x27;t know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name &#x27;Manning.&#x27; Then I get called to read another day.&quot;

Howarth stated, &quot;I was happy to get the part of Todd, but it was the furthest thing from the fabric of my personality.&quot; In an interview later that year, with &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot;, he grimaced when reminded of what he had said, and commented, &quot;What a totally self-involved, pretentious thing to say.&quot; He clarified his previous statement, saying that although he seemed to be consistently cast as a &quot;bad guy&quot; and as a &quot;Greek frat brother-type&quot;, both his upbringing and experiences in college were different than those of Todd and his other roles. For example, Howarth was not in a fraternity in college, and, unlike Todd and his previous soap opera roles, Kent in &quot;Loving&quot; and Jory on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, status was unimportant to him.

Although Howarth was familiar with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. When asked about his roles, he was unable to explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. &quot;I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It&#x27;s just as easy to pretend I&#x27;m a bad guy as it is to pretend I&#x27;m a good guy,&quot; Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because &quot;[he knows] it&#x27;s all make-believe&quot;. He was perplexed by writers&#x27; need to redeem villains. &quot;Todd&#x27;s a pretty interesting character just the way he is,&quot; Howarth said in late 1994. &quot;There&#x27;s no need to fix it if it&#x27;s not broken. I don&#x27;t know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, &#x27;I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.&#x27; Well, Todd hasn&#x27;t been redeemed, and he&#x27;s still on the show.&quot; He added, &quot;I don&#x27;t love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn&#x27;t say &#x27;Hi&#x27; to him, but I do love playing this character.&quot;

Howarth said of starring on a soap opera, &quot;Every actor at one time passes through daytime. I wouldn&#x27;t have said yes to the offer if I didn&#x27;t want to stay a while on daytime.&quot; He added, &quot;I don&#x27;t crave fame. It&#x27;s kind of goofy. I didn&#x27;t want to be a public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. But I love rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll-there, I&#x27;d rather be a rock star. That would be cool.&quot; He said that &quot;like all soap actors,&quot; he sticks with the script the majority of the time, &quot;but every now and then he goes off the page,&quot; commenting, &quot;You get to direct yourself. You come up with a little bit. It&#x27;s improvisational. Maybe you&#x27;re doing it just for your castmates, but the audience catches on.&quot;

In 1997 and 1998, Todd was given comedic partners similar to the set-up in comedy teams, in which the &quot;funny guy&quot; usually has a &quot;straight man&quot; who either sets up the joke or simply does not understand it. Todd&#x27;s first partner was Charlie Briggs, portrayed by actor Robert J. Hogan. Hogan was first seen as Briggs in 1995, working for the rival publication &quot;The Banner&quot; before Todd &quot;[steals] him away&quot; to work at his newspaper. Hogan said, &quot;Briggs had been on the show for 17 years, but they never showed him.&quot; Scenes between Todd and Briggs typically involved Todd issuing &quot;some bizarre order&quot; to Briggs, or Todd asking Briggs a &quot;way-out question&quot; that was often &quot;way out of line&quot;. During these scenes, Briggs would often respond with a stupefied look on his face. Though Briggs appeared lost at some of Todd&#x27;s comments, Todd was sometimes unable to realize that the joke was about him. Hogan felt Briggs was &quot;more than a match&quot; for Todd. &quot;You look at a kid yelling at you,&quot; he said, &quot;and you can&#x27;t take him seriously.&quot;

Another of Todd&#x27;s comedic pairings is his friendship with a parrot he names Moose. Todd is closer to Moose than he is to most humans. He tells the bird his private thoughts and secrets, which causes conflict and antagonism between Moose and his wife at the time, Téa. Florencia Lozano, Téa&#x27;s portrayer, stated, &quot;My character ... has a very adversarial relationship with the bird ... It&#x27;s sort of jealous of me, I&#x27;m jealous of the bird. We&#x27;re both trying to get close to Todd.&quot; The bird was portrayed by two South American blue and gold macaws named Flash and Lucky, and an Animal Planet documentary stated that they had developed an &quot;impressive résumé&quot; by the time they appeared on &quot;OLTL.&quot; They were trained by Ed Richman, who had worked with the birds for fifteen years in TV shows such as &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;Jake and the Fatman. &quot;Richman stated that Howarth caught on &quot;real quick&quot; regarding his interaction with Flash and Lucky and said that he was the best actor he had worked with in the industry. The parrots were used for different purposes: for intimidating scenes where it looked like Moose &quot;was going to kill somebody&quot;, Richman used Flash, and Lucky was used for the &quot;loving, very caring, physically close&quot; portrayal of Moose. Like other actors, the parrots were able to connect, in character, with their fellow castmembers and achieve comedic timing with them. Voice actor Ron Gallop was hired to deliver Moose&#x27;s lines, which were crafted to help demonstrate Todd&#x27;s train of thought, signified Todd and Moose&#x27;s close bond, and consisted of funny or insulting remarks aimed at anyone causing problems for Todd.

===St. John===
Howarth&#x27;s departure from the series motivated &quot;OLTL&quot; writers and producers to do what many considered impossible: recast Todd. During Michael Malone&#x27;s second stint as head writer of &quot;OLTL&quot;, he had to decide if Todd would remain. Malone said that he and the other creators could not allow Todd to permanently leave the show&#x27;s canvas, so they chose to recast the role. They offered the role to Easton, who had portrayed the vampire Caleb Morley on the soap opera &quot;Port Charles&quot;, but he turned it down because he did not want to be affiliated with a role played by another established actor. Malone said that St. John&#x27;s audition was &quot;extraordinary&quot;, and that although a committee was involved in the recast, everyone agreed &quot;he was Todd&quot;. Malone felt that they made a risky decision, but St. John made it work and that he had made the character his own. Initially, St. John, in his first role in daytime television, was introduced as Walker Laurence, younger brother of Mitch Laurence.

Author Gerry Waggett stated that Walker was &quot;reinvented as Todd with plastic surgery&quot; after the show&#x27;s viewers accepted St. John as a part of the cast. The soap opera press and fans speculated for several months that Todd had been recast with St. John. Website Soap Central.com stated that despite executive producer Frank Valentini neither confirming nor denying it, St. John&#x27;s character exhibited &quot;Todd-like&quot; behavior. &quot;TV Guide&quot; confirmed the speculation and reported that St. John, when asked about it, stated, &quot;That would be fascinating, though I don&#x27;t see how it would work,&quot; and added, &quot;Todd [had] a different voice and height, but this is a soap world and anything can happen.&quot;

St. John&#x27;s version of Todd had undergone plastic surgery after being severely beaten during a murder attempt on his life ordered by Mitch Laurence. While recovering in the hospital, Todd conducts research and learns Mitch has a brother named Walker (also portrayed by St. John), who goes by the name Flynn Laurence. Todd pays Flynn for information on Mitch, and has extensive plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Flynn and get revenge on (as well as protect his family from) Mitch. The writers revealed Walker&#x27;s true identify slowly, allowing Walker to develop as a new character before hinting that he could be Todd.

St. John was unaware that Malone and the producers of &quot;OLTL&quot; were considering him as Todd, but had no strategy in his performance once he won the role. When speaking of the recast, he stated, &quot;It&#x27;s nice, because I had instant concrete relationships.&quot; He liked that he could consult old scripts and his fellow castmembers to gain information about his character, resources he did not have when playing Walker. He was able to use these resources to figure out his relationship to other characters, which helped him analyze how to play a scene. St. John stated that as an actor, he let the audience interpret the character, and believed in exploring and portraying the moment as it was written in the script. He said, &quot;Todd is already written on the page, so it&#x27;s my job to bring him to life in that moment.&quot;

St. John was instructed by the show&#x27;s directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth&#x27;s performances of Todd because they wanted him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth&#x27;s style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, &quot;I needed to get a sense of who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically.&quot; He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the other guy did. That&#x27;s his time.&quot; St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. &quot;I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident,&quot; he stated, &quot;but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody.&quot;

Unlike how most actors are trained, St. John believed that it was not up to the performer to interpret the character, but that a character existed regardless of how an actor played him, which he realized was &quot;an unusual way to approach acting&quot;. He also thought that playing Todd was fun and &quot;never boring to watch&quot; because Todd, although popular with the audience, is an unlikable character. St. John told Branco that when people asked him if Todd was capable of harming his loved ones, like his long-time love Blair or daughter Starr, St. John would say that Todd was capable of anything, even being sexually attracted to Starr or one of her friends, because to state otherwise meant that he was &quot;limiting the character&quot;. He added, &quot;Todd is a marvelous character to play because he could commit genocide, or find a cure for AIDS. He&#x27;s full of possibilities—good and bad ... See, as an actor that always gives you conflict to play—and that subtext enriches a performance.&quot;

==Early writing and literary analysis==
===Archetypes and rape===
Howarth said writers go with a recognizable archetype when creating soap opera characters. Writer Jennifer Hayward felt the same, stating that like 19th century melodrama and serials, soap operas draw on powerful archetypes. Writer Dianne L. Brooks states that the storyline conforms to many of the same conventions of how rape has been presented in soap operas. According to Hayward, the &quot;OLTL&quot; writers &quot;had a terrific time camping up Todd as the embodiment of evil&quot;. She said that the writers who created Todd&#x27;s first major storyline, the gang rape of Marty Saybrooke and its aftermath, treated rape like most soap operas had done in the past, by using archetypes such as the fight between good and evil and the contrast between the weak and strong. Author Gerry Waggett said, &quot;The close-ups of the rapists&#x27; faces during the assault, distorted to capture Marty&#x27;s scared and drunken perspective, rank among the show&#x27;s most graphic images.&quot; An attempt was made to dramatize the rape and present it differently than the typical voyeuristic perspective, and the scenes were designed to disturb the audience. Waggett added: &quot;Marty&#x27;s subsequent quest to bring her rapists to justice dominated the show&quot; throughout the summer of 1993.

Up to this point, soap operas used rape and its related archetypes to, like their nineteenth-century melodrama counterparts, &quot;critique power relationships, especially the oppression of the poor by the rich and of women by men&quot;. Hayward believes that the storyline was initially flawed because two of the rapists, Todd and Zach, were demonized, which oversimplified rape and &quot;failed to capture the complex power relations underlying ... violence towards women&quot;. The perpetrators were &quot;simply evil or out control&quot;, so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected. The three characters represented three archetypes of the rapist: &quot;the evil instigator&quot; (Todd); &quot;the good resister&quot; (Powell), and &quot;the mediator between these polarized figures&quot; (Zach), but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas. Brooks called the rapists &quot;a complicated alternative to the standard soap opera rapist&quot;, because they had a different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple. Todd, whom Brooks called the &quot;evil &#x27;other, was the leader and most villainous of the group and had a previous physical relationship with Marty. Hayward said, &quot;What becomes especially clear is that for these characters the act of rape is not about sex, about women, or even about Marty. It is about what takes place ... between men.&quot;

Like serials throughout history, soap operas use the unstable identity as a literary device, which is evidenced by the genre&#x27;s use of mistaken identities, evil twins, and characters that suffer from multiple personality disorder and whom come back from the dead. Identity is used in the rape storyline as well. Before the rape, Todd was crude yet still human, but afterwards, he became a dehumanized embodiment of rage, demonstrated by Todd&#x27;s bizarre and dangerous behavior after his conviction. Powell Lord, whose name is full of the same kind of symbolism Dickens used when choosing his characters&#x27; names and who initially urges his friends to let Marty go yet ultimately gives into peer pressure, is a &quot;relative &#x27;good character as compared to Todd&#x27;s absolute evil&#x27; identity&quot;. In Hayward&#x27;s opinion, &quot;The show also departs from the rape paradigm not only by insisting on the essential &#x27;goodness&#x27; of Powell Lord ... but even more startlingly by redeeming the evil Todd&quot;. Initially, &quot;the increasingly guilt-ridden&quot; Powell is the only rapist who has a conscience. He attempts to convince Todd and Zach to confess their crime, and comes close to confessing to his lawyer. Hayward calls Powell, like Todd, &quot;redeemed&quot;, but unlike Todd, was so guilt-ridden that he attempted suicide, was forgiven by Marty, and received a much lighter jail sentence than Zach or Todd.

===Redeeming Todd===
Initially, Todd, as described by Hayward, was written as &quot;unequivocally bad: sullen, remorseless, charmless&quot;. As Todd&#x27;s popularity grew with the audience, mostly due to Howarth&#x27;s abilities to portray Todd as more than a one-dimensional rapist, Malone and executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan chose the controversial option of redeeming Todd rather than killing him off or permanently sending him to prison, which is what soap operas had usually done with irredeemable rapists in the past. The writers began to redeem Todd, or change him so that he could be incorporated into the show, in the spring of 1994, a year after the rape. Hayward states that it required &quot;a whole arsenal of symbolic weaponry,&quot; something that had never happened in soap operas before. Malone was intrigued by crafting the story in this way, and saw it as the spiritual journey of a man who wanted forgiveness for his past misdeeds.

Malone stated that Todd believes that he does not deserve forgiveness, which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities, something Malone felt worked better due to Howarth&#x27;s acting choices, which prevented Todd from acquiring redemption easily. Malone felt the most important part of Todd&#x27;s redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact he initiated her rape. As well as having Todd risk his freedom from prison and save Marty from a car crash, Todd donates his own blood to Marty to ensure she survives. A year later, he risks his life to save Patrick, Marty&#x27;s lover, from death; this act leads to Todd&#x27;s presumed death. Despite having the character yearn to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt his good deeds should never make him feel any less horrible for having raped Marty. Initially, Howarth disagreed, and did not consider the storylines to be redemptive. &quot;[Todd&#x27;s] not being redeemed at all,&quot; he said. &quot;Todd, as I see it, is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again. From now on, his menace will be on the surface, not exploding. It&#x27;s more interesting if his violence is on the surface and that he play against it. That&#x27;s where the subtlety is.&quot;

Hayward stated that the writers turned Todd from a realistic soap opera character into &quot;the villain appropriated from nineteenth-century melodrama&quot; and Gothic fiction traditions. After Todd is sent to prison for Marty&#x27;s rape, he vows he will escape, and does so by drugging himself and forcing himself to wake up from a coma, which allows him to escape from a speeding ambulance. He returns to Llanview to stalk and terrorize Nora, the lawyer who threw his court case, who had gone temporarily blind. He tries to rape Marty for the third time, later inadvertently kills Marty&#x27;s boyfriend Suede during a scuffle, kidnaps the evangelist Rebecca Lewis, and is shot by the police, but survives. The writers also began to deepen his character by emphasizing his tenderness towards Rebecca and showing flashbacks of the abuse he experienced from his adoptive father, which Hayward states does not &quot;historicize the problem but simply removes the cause of violence one step&quot;. Laurie Stone of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; commented that Howarth&#x27;s performance steered Todd away from cartoon villainy, &quot;heightening the character&#x27;s wildness as a dodge from sentimentality and high-mindedness&quot;. Instead of killing Todd off as other soap operas had done to other unrepentant rapists, &quot;OLTL&quot; chose, as Stone put it, &quot;to renovate the genre: maintaining Todd as a rapist, while enlarging his human dimension&quot;.

Stone addressed how the writers kept Todd on the &quot;OLTL&quot; canvas, stating, &quot;Characters as dangerous as Todd go up in flames on soaps. You can see little coffins on their eyelids, leaving only one question: how will the fiend get whacked?&quot; Stone said that &quot;Todd was this close to being offed, but Howarth made that choice laughable. Rampaging through fictional Llanview, he injected ambiguity into the bluntest dialogue, his sneers averting cynicism to reveal depression and humor&quot; and &quot;transformed Todd into a soul-wrenched Lucifer, his rage ripped from abuse and bathed in vengeful glee, his sexiness rising off his instinct for survival and his outlaw impulse to disrupt.&quot; She added, &quot;Even the ragged scar he acquired on one cheek only heightened his animal appeal. No soap would jettison such gold and electricity—a figure simultaneously furious, ironic, melancholy, and horny.&quot;

The writers used strong imagery to redeem Todd. Malone, who had been a novelist and was known for his &quot;Dickensian&quot; plots on &quot;OLTL&quot;, was influenced by nineteenth-century literature. Malone told Stone that he compared Rebecca&#x27;s decision to marry Powell instead of Todd to Cathy&#x27;s decision to marry Edgar Linton instead of Heathcliff in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. According to Stone, Todd is a classical character−&quot;a soap character of unprecedented psychological complexity, a being whose feelings are intrinsically mixed and mostly unresolvable&quot;.

Hayward stated that Malone and his team of writers used four techniques drawn from the conventions of Victorian sentimental fiction to redeem Todd: his unhappy childhood with an aloof but caring mother and abusive father; sending Todd to church to confess his past sins and present impulses; his love for Rebecca, &quot;an innocent and highly religious virgin&quot;; and his friendship with two children, C.J. and Sarah Roberts. Hayward calls Rebecca, with her &quot;open-mouthed passivity&quot; and &quot;pre-Raphaelite curls&quot;, &quot;almost a caricature of Dicken&#x27;s more sentimental and less felicitous heroines&quot;. She believes that many of Todd&#x27;s scenes with Rebecca are heavily iconic, with symbolic representations of the Virgin Mary and Freudian images of Todd&#x27;s own feminization.
Hayward compares Todd to Mary Shelley&#x27;s monster (Frankenstein&#x27;s monster), especially his friendship with C.J. and Sarah. Shelley&#x27;s monster watches two children playing, and saves a young girl from drowning. Similarly, Todd rescues C.J. and Sarah&#x27;s cousin, Jessica, from being manhandled by an older boy; this leads to him meeting C.J. and Sarah. Like Shelley&#x27;s monster, Todd observes the family&#x27;s happy moments from afar, and wishes to be part of their lives. He uses his time alone to make toys for the children. Once they accidentally discover him, he manipulates them into keeping his whereabouts a secret by telling them he is &quot;a genie on the run from an evil master&quot;. Hayward said, &quot;The stories he tells them function as clear metaphors for his feelings about his father.&quot; Stone added that Todd&#x27;s counseling sessions in prison were the writers&#x27; attempts to redeem Todd, and both she and Hayward include one of the final techniques the writers used: Todd&#x27;s rescue of Marty, Jessica and C.J. soon after a car crash. Hayward calls the writers&#x27; attempts to use powerful narrative and visual techniques to redeem Todd &quot;dubious at best&quot;.

Writer Mary D. Dutta believed that &quot;OLTL&quot;, in order to &quot;assuage the moral qualms associated with a sympathetic rapist&quot;, added &quot;mitigating reasons for Todd&#x27;s sexual abuse of Marty&quot;; namely, that he was raped at the age of fourteen by his adoptive father, Peter Manning, though whether or not he was raped is disputed. Dutta feels that the gang rape storyline invokes many of the rape myths that have appeared in literature since the 18th century, which includes &quot;only bad girls get raped,&quot; &quot;women ask for it,&quot; and &quot;women &#x27;cry rape&#x27; only when they&#x27;ve been jilted or have something to cover up&quot;. Dutta also includes the myth of the &quot;reformed rake&quot;, or &quot;the rapist redeemed by the woman who loves him, not uncommonly the same woman he raped&quot;, which &quot;deny or reduce perceived injury, or ... blame the victims for their own victimization&quot;. Dutta states, &quot;Todd&#x27;s redemption begins with his rescue of Marty and two children from a car wreck and ends with the discovery that he is the rightful heir to a huge fortune.&quot;

==Reception and impact==
===General popularity===
Todd&#x27;s impact is varied. The rape storyline inspired feminist studies, and, in 1994, &quot;OLTL&quot; was awarded several Daytime Emmys in writing and acting for all the principles involved. Michael Malone and Josh Griffith&#x27;s team won an Emmy for writing, Susan Haskell won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and Hillary B. Smith was awarded the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Howarth won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series. In 1995, Howarth was nominated for an Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; (&quot;SOD&quot;) named him Outstanding Leading Actor. &quot;SOD &quot;also named him Outstanding Villain in 1998. While Howarth has been called a &quot;fan favorite, and one of the best actors in soaps&quot;, Todd has been called &quot;one of the greatest characters of all-time&quot; and Howarth&#x27;s portrayal of him has been called &quot;iconic&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that even though Todd was a convicted rapist, he was the most popular character and Howarth was the most popular actor on &quot;OLTL&quot;. According to Waggett, the rape storyline propelled Todd &quot;onto the list of &quot;OLTL&quot; most despicable villains&quot;. He said that due to the storyline and to Howarth&#x27;s talent, Todd &quot;became the show&#x27;s next centerpiece villain and eventually the show&#x27;s male lead&quot;. Howarth appeared on several interview shows following his Emmy win in 1994, including the &quot;Phil Donahue Show&quot; in May, with six other male soap stars, and later that month, on &quot;Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;. Host Regis Philbin commented on the fact that Howarth was receiving more fan mail than any other American soap opera star, and called him &quot;a terrible villain, who&#x27;s become a heartthrob to thousands of wildly adoring fans&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; referred to Todd as a breakout character.
At the height of Todd&#x27;s popularity, which was called &quot;Todd-mania&quot; and &quot;the Todd Manning phenomenon&quot;, Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show&#x27;s writers had begun to redeem the character. In a September 1995 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that &quot;his villainous character became such a fan favorite&quot;. In October 1995, Howarth told &quot;SOD&quot;, &quot;People have come up to me and said, &#x27;My 7-year-old loves you.&#x27; What do I say to that? I&#x27;m not going to tell them, &#x27;Don&#x27;t let your 7-year-old watch TV.&#x27; But I have to say, it&#x27;s disturbing.&quot; He gave credit to the show&#x27;s writers for Todd&#x27;s popularity, saying that the rapists&#x27; trial was well constructed and added, &quot;I think, right now, we&#x27;re just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don&#x27;t really know why people like Todd&quot;.

Todd&#x27;s rampant popularity intruded on Howarth&#x27;s life. &quot;It&#x27;s really starting to frustrate me because I can&#x27;t just go to work anymore,&quot; he said. He stopped doing a lot of press interviews after female fans screamed &quot;Rape me, Todd&quot; at fan events, and because of his disagreement with Todd&#x27;s redemption arc. His comings-and-goings from time to time throughout the years, even though the role of Todd had been re-cast with St. John, were greeted with anticipation, excitement, and speculation from the fans. At one point in 2000, Howarth returned for a week, accompanied by significant fanfare, in order to assist with the departure of Florencia Lozano (Teá). During the ten years he was on the show, rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by the soap opera press.

&quot;Soap Opera Magazine&quot; attributed the success of Todd to Howarth&#x27;s face and skill as an actor. In February 1998, the magazine stated, &quot;Although the scar that traverses his face while he plays Llanview&#x27;s dark prince isn&#x27;t real, the menacing intensity Roger Howarth can so effortlessly convey with his eyes and furrowed brow are frighteningly authentic.&quot; &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; called his presence &quot;hypnotic&quot; and stated that his eyes relayed his focus. The magazine added that Howarth &quot;has given Todd such a deliciously frightening edge we hope he wreaks more havoc in Llanview&quot;. Marla Hart of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that &quot;it has been an unexpected pleasure to watch actor Roger Howarth as a lost soul in search of spiritual redemption&quot;. Hart speculated that the darkness Howarth brought to the role made him interesting to watch and was responsible for his Emmy win in 1994.

St. John and the writers received praise for the recast, and for successfully re-integrating Todd into the show&#x27;s canvas. &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; stated, &quot;They said it couldn&#x27;t be done. &quot;One Life to Live&#x27;s&quot; Todd (previously played by Roger Howarth) could not be recast. But with an appealing actor and the right pacing, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; may just have done it&quot;. The magazine stated that the writers revealed Todd&#x27;s identity slowly, letting Walker develop as a character before dropping hints that he might be Todd. By the time he disclosed who he really was to his daughter Starr, the audience had already suspected the truth. &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; called the reveal scene between St. John and Alderson, who played Starr, &quot;one of those great (and, these days, rare) must-see moments&quot;. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; said that despite the recast, a difficult situation in and of itself, &quot;St. John aptly distinguished between Walker, who&#x27;s really Todd, as well as Flynn, who pretended to be Walker&quot;. The magazine stated that St. John revealed glimmers of Todd to the audience: &quot;We could see Todd when Walker lowered his eyes while holding back from telling his sister, Viki; with fiancee Blair, Walker&#x27;s gaze was always shifting, making sure nothing could clue her in to his secret&quot;. The article also credited St. John with maintaining &quot;the [uniquely scheming] relationship of Todd and Starr&quot; and for keeping their scenes touching and delightful.

On May 29, 2006, in what the soap opera section of SheKnows described as &quot;one of the most memorable moments&quot; for &quot;OLTL&quot;, and &quot;breathtaking, nerve-racking, heart wrenching&quot;, St. John portrayed Todd being executed for a crime he did not commit. At the last moment, after the lethal injection has been administered, John McBain rushes in declaring Todd&#x27;s innocence, with proof: the woman Todd is accused of killing (Margaret Cochran) is at his side, clearly still alive. Todd is revived soon afterward. During the execution episode, a montage a little over four minutes in length was shown while a song played in the background. The song was called &quot;Forsaken&quot; (or &quot;Todd&#x27;s Song&quot;) and written by Michal Towber especially for the show. The montage included reaction shots of those witnessing the execution, shots of Starr crying in the presence of a lynch mob outside the prison, and flashbacks of Todd&#x27;s children and of Blair during both St. John and Howarth&#x27;s tenures as Todd, with Howarth&#x27;s face unseen. The scenes were called &quot;unbearable&quot; by viewers, and their responses were varied. Much of the audience was infuriated by Blair&#x27;s unwillingness to believe that Todd was innocent. Many viewers thought that Todd&#x27;s death was permanent; &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; speculated that this was due to limited Internet access or to a lack of interest in spoilers.

Although fans and St. John&#x27;s co-workers felt that he deserved an Emmy nomination for his death row performances, he did not receive one, but &quot;OLTL&quot; received a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series by submitting the episode. One soap opera website criticized St. John&#x27;s Emmy snub, stating that it was incongruous that the show&#x27;s Best Show nomination was due in large part to St. John&#x27;s performance. Soap opera commentators Nelson Branco and Michael Fairman called St. John&#x27;s execution performances the best on any daytime drama in the early 2000s. Towber and other composers for the show were nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction and Composition for a Drama Series.

===Controversy and fan debate===
====Rape and redemption====
Although the gang rape storyline was well-received, it was also criticized. Jennifer Hayward, in her literary analysis of the rape and its similarity to nineteenth century melodrama, stated that this storyline not only polarized &quot;the gap between rapists and the raped but also the figure of the rapist himself&quot;, and that insisting on &quot;the &#x27;essential&#x27; goodness&quot; of Powell Lord implied that peer pressure &quot;could be an adequate (or even physiologically possible) excuse for rape&quot;. Scholar Mary Buhl Dutta, arguing that the storyline perpetuated rape myths, commented on how the series especially used Marty, who fulfilled the stereotype of &quot;the bad girl&quot; who was the rape victim. Dutta stated that &quot;Marty had once &#x27;cried rape when the Rev. Andrew Carpenter &quot;rebuffed her romantic overtures, falsely accusing him of sexually abusing a boy he was counseling&quot;. After she was actually raped, she falsely yet unintentionally accuses Kevin Buchanan, who was innocent. Marty, according to Dutta, &quot;is a &#x27;bad girl&#x27; because she had a one-night stand with Todd before the rape, bolstering his later claim she &#x27;asked for it&#x27; in their second sexual encounter&quot;.

Critics have wondered why Todd is popular. Soap opera journalist Marlena De Lacroix, who acknowledged that she neither liked nor understood Todd, expressed her inability to understand his popularity among so many fans, even during his several hiatuses from the show. She asked, &quot;Why has the show devoted years of storyline time to him and all but made a hero out of a criminal?&quot; Hayward, who said that her own response to Todd&#x27;s redemption was ambivalent, called the writers&#x27; attempt to redeem Todd controversial and stated that the role of Rebecca, the woman the writers paired Todd with during the redemption process, &quot;seems to encourage both female and male fantasies about the power of a &#x27;good woman&#x27; to save a man from his own violent impulses&quot;. In his book &quot;Behold the Man&quot;, Edisol Dotson suggested that viewers accepted Todd&#x27;s redemption because he was physically attractive. Dotson stated, &quot;Were Todd an ugly man, he would have never been forgiven, and female fans would not crowd the studio&#x27;s backdoor shouting his name.&quot;

Soap opera commentator Jenn Bishop said she found it difficult to explain Todd&#x27;s popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, it is understandable that others would be as well. &quot;If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I&#x27;d say he&#x27;s an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities,&quot; she said. &quot;His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn&#x27;t want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor would I want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him.&quot; Instead of seeing Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of &quot;an anti-anti-hero&quot; and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. &quot;While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn&#x27;t leave a lot of room for rewrites,&quot; Bishop commented. &quot;For example, Luke&#x27;s rape of Laura on &quot;General Hospital&quot; was rewritten and for years was referred to as a &#x27;seduction.&#x27; There was no &#x27;grey area&#x27;. This [Todd&#x27;s rape of Marty] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue.&quot; To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, &quot;was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another&quot; and &quot;[a]ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can&#x27;t help but like&quot;.

Hayward categorized the writing team involved in Todd&#x27;s redemption as &quot;an usually high number of male writers&quot;, and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with &quot;TV Guide&quot;, in an article about the trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that &quot;[t]he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films,&quot; and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable &quot;all began as totally irredeemable villains.&quot; Although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers &quot;are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [women] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, &#x27;With me, he&#x27;d be different. The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone&#x27;s statements, and commented, &quot;Let&#x27;s call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists&quot;. Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.

Howarth said he had no desire to portray a redeemed Todd, and that the show would be better off finding &quot;a Todd who won&#x27;t object to the material.&quot; He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I&#x27;ll always be proud of this story, because it was the result of a real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn&#x27;t one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [Then-Executive Producer] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [&quot;One Life to Live&quot;] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn&#x27;t think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I&#x27;d been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it&#x27;s a fairy tale. I thought, &quot;It would be best for the show if I were to leave.&quot; That&#x27;s when I tendered my resignation.

Howarth also stated that Todd and Marty suddenly bonding, even if reluctantly, did not make sense and that he could not, in good conscience, support Todd&#x27;s redemption by continuing to play him as Todd Lord, who had become a likable character. Since the rape was, as he called it, &quot;so in-depth and so brutal&quot;, he viewed Todd and Marty doing something like having drinks with each other bizarre. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that &quot;One Life to Live&quot; agreed to let Howarth go on the condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months. &quot;Indy Week&quot; said, &quot;Todd was partially redeemed into a self-destructive antihero who remained popular until the show&#x27;s end, but his portrayer and many critics were wary of having him becoming a romantic lead.&quot;

====Merchandising====
In 2002, as part of ABC&#x27;s push to sell merchandise from its soap operas, the network began selling a doll in Todd&#x27;s likeness on its website, but were thwarted by a backlash. Modeled after cartoon versions of the Manning family that Starr would sometimes imagine, the doll sold for $19.95. According to the description on the site, it was &quot;an all-cloth doll with brown felt hair and blue eyes. He is 20 inches standing. He wears a blue shirt and black pants&quot;. The doll&#x27;s face also included Todd&#x27;s scar. Even though several years had passed since the gang rape and Todd had &quot;since settled down&quot;, and had become a more sympathetic character, rape victim advocate groups thought that selling the doll glorified sexual assault; so ABC removed the doll from its online store. Pictures of the doll were pulled from the Internet and the doll was blocked from being available at eBay or any other online store.

The controversy began when the industry newsletter &quot;The Jack Myers Report&quot; harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. Bob Tedeschi of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don&#x27;t try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists&quot;. Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, &quot;I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive to the history of the character and I wasn&#x27;t&quot;. Another ABC executive stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll&quot;. A doll of Todd&#x27;s daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; commented, &quot;I suppose ABC didn&#x27;t have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests.&quot; He added, &quot;It was a stupid SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you&#x27;re offended by that, how do you get through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?&quot;

====Recasting====
When Todd was recast with St. John after Howarth&#x27;s departure, many fans felt that like the roles of Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) on &quot;General Hospital&quot; and Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) on &quot;All My Children&quot;, Todd should be portrayed only by the actor who had originated the role. As &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; put it, &quot;Few recasts caused more uproar&quot;. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; also stated that while there were fans who &quot;will only consider Howarth to be their beloved Todd&quot;, St. John won over many fans by putting a lighter spin on the character. &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; stated that they were &quot;on board with St. John&quot;. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; agreed, commenting that St. John made the transition believable while adding new facets to the character. The magazine also stated that Todd&#x27;s new appearance aided in his continuing redemption. Soap opera columnist Jill Berry expressed her approval for the recast, stating, &quot;Trevor&#x27;s Todd continues to impress me. He has given some sweetness to Todd that I find totally appealing&quot;.

In late 2006, St. John and Howarth simultaneously began contract negotiations with their respective shows, which caused rumors that St. John was departing from &quot;OLTL&quot;, leaving room for Howarth, who was with the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; at the time, to return as Todd. &quot;TV Guide&quot; sought to clear up the matter and questioned executive producer Frank Valentini, who stated that although he was not able to comment on contracts, the producers were &quot;doing our best to make sure that we do right by the audience&quot;. In 2007, &quot;TV Guide&quot; received official confirmation Howarth would not be returning to the series. The magazine conducted a poll on its website, TV Guide.com, and found that 82 percent of the show&#x27;s viewers wanted to see Howarth return. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide.com disagreed with the results, stating, &quot;Perhaps I&#x27;m in the minority, but I absolutely adore Trevor St. John&quot;, whose portrayal of Todd he found &quot;very cocky, arrogant and humorous in a sexy way&quot;.

In 2009, following the announcement that &quot;As the World Turns&quot; would be cancelled in 2010, rumors that Howarth would return to &quot;OLTL&quot; regained momentum. The rumors were further fueled by an August 2010 episode of &quot;OLTL,&quot; in which Howarth&#x27;s picture was shown and a delirious Téa stated that the current Todd (St. John) was not Todd Manning. This resulted in what Dan Kroll of the website Soap Opera Central.com described as fans &quot;rac[ing] to their computers to figure out the meaning of the scene&quot;. Kroll speculated that the scene was &quot;crafted merely to get fans talking, or was it a hint to viewers something big was coming down the pike?&quot; Soap Opera Network, citing unnamed sources and pointing to the 2010 episode, reported on their website that they had &quot;learned exclusively Howarth [would] indeed be returning&quot; to the series in the near future. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; columnist Carolyn Hinsey dismissed the report, stating on her Facebook page, &quot;Seriously, stop with the Howarth misinformation here please. He is not coming back to &quot;OLTL.&quot; Case closed.&quot; Some fans were convinced that St. John&#x27;s character was an impostor, while others were not; although Howarth eventually returned as Todd in 2011, his return was initially accompanied with fan debate regarding what role he would play, Todd Manning or a new character.

====Violence towards teenagers====
According to Nelson Branco of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;OLTL&quot; aired &quot;some of the most explosive and ugliest scenes ever broadcast on daytime&quot; television in March 2008 when Todd beat up teenager Cole Thornhart (his daughter&#x27;s boyfriend and Marty&#x27;s son), and slapped Starr and Cole&#x27;s friends Markko Rivera and Langston Wilde. Todd barges in on Starr and Cole in bed together for the first time, jumping to the conclusion that Cole had raped her, &quot;and [beats] the son of his rape victim relentlessly&quot;. At least one soap opera blogger was outraged, and wanted Todd to be punished.

In Branco&#x27;s opinion, head writer Ron Carlivati wanted to use the storyline to return Todd to his dark roots by showing him as a monster again, stating, &quot;Carlivati chose to do something unique, bold and risky with one of his marquee characters&quot;, demonstrating Todd&#x27;s damaged personality and calling into question his mental stability. Carlivati said that Todd was convinced that Starr&#x27;s alleged rape was karmic payback, even when Starr insisted that she had not been raped. Branco postulated that Todd&#x27;s conclusion and strong reaction to seeing the two in bed together was Todd&#x27;s inability to separate sex from violence, stating, &quot;Todd, in that instance, became unhinged, paranoid, and out-of-control&quot;. Todd was in denial, and even almost hit Starr twice when she challenged his beliefs. The scenes were praised as &quot;riveting&quot;. Soap columnist Marlena De Lacroix, a self-described &quot;Todd hater&quot; who felt that the character was psychotic, expressed hope that they were &quot;the beginning of a storyline that will delve into Todd&#x27;s mind and enlighten viewers as to the complexities of a character who is mentally ill&quot;. De Lacroix worried that although the storyline had the potential to be memorable, it could be another way to build sympathy for Todd.

====Revictimizing Marty====

Deciding to revisit the rape storyline in 2007, Carlivati wrote a story in which Marty is thrown from a van during a car crash later that year. The van explodes, and she is presumed dead. In June 2008, Todd discovers her alive, and finds that she is afflicted with amnesia and has been crippled since the crash. He starts to nurse her back to health, lying to her about her identity and her importance to the people she loves, and he starts to develop romantic feelings for her. ABC promoted the storyline by airing ads that called it, &quot;The story you thought you&#x27;d never see&quot;. Carlivati defended the storyline by assuring the audience, who was concerned about and resisted the storyline, that it would not have been written if Marty had not lost her memories. He stated that he was aware of how serious it was pairing the characters romantically, but did not feel like they were damaging Marty&#x27;s character. Carlivati was committed to having the storyline progress slowly, and to using the actors&#x27; and characters&#x27; chemistry. Eventually, Todd and Marty have sex; Todd insists that he has always been in love with Marty and plots to steal his daughter&#x27;s baby (who is also Marty&#x27;s grandchild), run off with Marty and the baby, and raise the baby with her. 
According to Branco, the show&#x27;s past writing teams had proposed creating a Marty and Todd love story, but it never happened, mostly because Haskell and Howarth had refused to participate. In Branco&#x27;s opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left &quot;OLTL&quot; for &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m all for gang rape.&quot; He later issued an apology for the comment: &quot;I should know better than to ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject. I intended no disre[s]pect and apologize to anyone I offended.&quot;

De Lacroix found Carlivati&#x27;s storyline &quot;disgusting&quot;, stating that it was exploitative, misogynistic, insulting to the audience, and &quot;the most phony, stupidly contrived story I have ever seen&quot;. She also felt that it was a severe misjustice to the original storyline. Fans who were opposed to the storyline called it &quot;the re-rape&quot;, and ABC aired public service announcements (PSAs) during the Todd and Marty sex scene for their viewers. Berry supported ABC&#x27;s use of the PSAs, but felt that they were used to justify the storyline and stated that it would have been better to not have presented it in the first place. Lynn Parrish, a spokesperson for Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN), which was not consulted by the show&#x27;s writers, spoke out against the &quot;re-rape&quot; storyline. She told Branco, &quot;There is nothing romantic about rape&quot;, and that &quot;whoever writes a romance between a rapist and its victim under any circumstances clearly doesn&#x27;t understand rape nor violence—and probably shouldn&#x27;t be writing about it&quot;.

Branco called the original rape storyline &quot;the gold standard of rape stories,&quot; and stated that Carlivati had changed it into a soap opera cliché. Carlivati&#x27;s addition to the characters&#x27; histories left him feeling betrayed, hurt, depressed, angry, insulted, and disgusted, and he said that he had wasted almost 20 years investing in and believing in the original rape storyline. At the &quot;re-rape&quot; storyline&#x27;s conclusion, Branco stated that the payoff was worth the tense moments. &quot;However obscene or depraved the riskiest storyline in recent memory was,&quot; he said, &quot;the fallout has been shockingly riveting—thanks to the fact that head writer Ron Carlivati is playing all the psychological beats of Todd&#x27;s self-serving and criminal actions.&quot; Branco also gave credit to St. John. &quot;Nominated for a 2009 Soap Opera Spirit Award as outstanding lead actor, St. John inarguably faced the most challenging assignment of any actor in 2008—in any genre,&quot; said Branco. &quot;And yet, somehow, St. John made it work. In a lesser actor&#x27;s hands, the storyline most certainly would have resulted in career suicide for all involved.&quot;

<text>Willem Willink (sometimes Wilhelm, Wilheim, or Wilhem) (1750 – 1841) was a wealthy Amsterdam merchant, and one of the investors in the Holland Land Company, and the Louisiana Purchase. 

==Biography==


The Willink family came from Winterswijk and belonged to the Mennonite congregation. In 1775 when Willem married Hester Bierens he lived at Keizersgracht (near 268). He usually cooperated with his brother Jan (1778-1827). In 1791 they moved into a mansion at Herengracht close to Leidsegracht.

At the end of the 18th century, it became fashionable for Dutch businessmen and bankers to invest in the young United States, and many were talked into investing in land there after John Adams signed the trade treaty with the Netherlands in 1782. The group of investors in the Holland Land Company purchased American assets from Robert Morris that were bundled as &quot;negotiaties&quot; (a sort of market fund) and marketed in the Netherlands. These assets included the large tract of land in western New York plus tracts in central New York, western and northern Pennsylvania. The investments were reorganized as the Holland Land Company in 1795 with shares issued to: the Willinks (28.6%), Pieter Stadnitski (23.2%), Jan and Nicolaas van Staphorst &amp; Nicolaas Hubbard (21.4%), Pieter and Christiaan van Eeghen &amp; Company (14.3%), Isaäk ten Cate &amp; Hendrick Vollenhoven (8.9%), and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, politician and legal adviser (3.8%). Robert Morris was involved in land dealings with the Holland Land Company.

==Legacy==
Willink&#x27;s name was given to the Town of Willink when it was created from Batavia, New York in 1804. It was included in Niagara County when the latter was formed in 1808 from Genesee County.

The Town of Willink, along with the Town of Clarence, was taken to form Erie County in 1821. The Town of Willink was then dispersed by the formation of newer towns in Erie County (such as Concord, Eden, and Aurora). Some of the investor names appear on the Treaty of Big Tree, by which the Iroquois sold off their rights to most of the land in the Holland Land Purchase.

The names of the investors were formerly given to locations in western New York, but they have since been replaced. Buffalo, New York itself was briefly called New Amsterdam. Stadnitski Avenue in Buffalo is now Church Street. Schimmelpenninck Avenue is now Niagara Street. Buffalo streets were also named after Willink and Van Staphorst. Their names appear as the original owners on most deeds for land in this part of New York.

Their &quot;Agent General&quot; (COO) was Theophilus Cazenove, later succeeded by Paul Busti and then John Jacob Vanderkemp. Resident agents included Gerrit Boon, Adam Gerard Mappa, Joseph Ellicott, Benjamin Ellicott, William Peacock, and many others.

In 1801 Willem and Jan Willink, merchants in Amsterdam, were enabled to purchase and hold real property in the town of Havre de Grace in Harford County. Ultimately, the syndicate earned only modest profit from the investment, but their funds greatly assisted the development of the United States.

Wilhelm Willink had a summer estate on the Spaarne River, neighboring the estate villa Welgelegen of his associate Henry Hope.

<text>Alan Gifford Miller (born November 6, 1969) is the former Speaker of the New York City Council who represented the 5th district. Barred from seeking reelection due to term limits, the Democrat ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for the opportunity to run against incumbent Republican Mayor, Michael Bloomberg in November 2005.

==Early life and education==

Miller grew up in New York City with mother Lynden B. Miller, a prominent landscape designer, and father Leigh Miller, who was a political appointee to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.

Miller attended St. Bernard&#x27;s School, a Manhattan day school for young boys. He graduated from Middlesex School and Princeton University, earning a degree in political science. Following his graduation from Princeton in 1992, Miller joined the staff of Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat who represents the New York 14th Congressional District, which overlaps Council District 5. Council District 5 represents of the Upper East Side, Yorkville, Carnegie Hill, Turtle Bay, Sutton Place and Roosevelt Island.

Miller dropped out of Fordham University Law School in 2000 to focus on his successful race for the New York City Council Speaker.

==Career==
On January 9, 1996, Miller won his first term in the New York City Council at the age of 26. He was the first Democrat in recent history elected to represent the traditionally wealthy district. He easily won reelection in 1997, 2001 and 2003; term limits laws prohibited him from seeking a fifth term. Following a unanimous election on January 9, 2002, Miller succeeded Peter Vallone, Sr. to become the second Speaker of the New York City Council.

Under Miller&#x27;s leadership the Council passed new laws to protect children from lead-paint poisoning, expanded civil rights, strengthened the City&#x27;s campaign finance system and established tax credits to encourage greater energy savings and cleaner air.

Miller led the Council in enacting some of the most sweeping changes in land use policy in the City&#x27;s history. Miller set a new standard for affordable housing requirements as part of land use applications, broadening the use of inclusionary zoning. Miller pushed through historic rezonings for Manhattan&#x27;s Far West Side and Chelsea districts and the Williamsburg-Greenpoint area.

Miller helped lead the City&#x27;s response to the fiscal crisis that followed the September 11 attacks. Faced with a $7.5 billion budget gap, Miller approved more than $3 billion in budget cuts overall, while protecting critical public safety and emergency services.

Miller sought the Democratic mayoral nomination in 2005. His opponents for the nomination included former Bronx borough president Fernando Ferrer, Congressman Anthony D. Weiner and outgoing Manhattan borough president C. Virginia Fields. The winner of the Democratic primary election on September 13, 2005 was Ferrer, who was easily defeated by Republican mayor Michael Bloomberg in the general election held on November 8, 2005.

Miller was, according to a York Magazine&quot; article, barraged by local media, and politicos. Some claimed that Miller lacked the &quot;ethnic base&quot; necessary to be a successful politician in New York City-wide elections. According to the &quot;New York Observer&quot;, Miller is &quot;widely regarded as a decent and talented man&quot; who has nonetheless shown &quot;signs of immaturity: his reversal on lead-paint legislation after pressure from special interests; his eagerness to spend the city budget surplus to hire teachers, reopen firehouses and cut taxes despite an ongoing climate of fiscal uncertainty&quot;.

Although Miller had the most money of any of the candidates in the Democratic field, as well as many key endorsements, he suffered severe reversals of fortune in the final month of the primary. He failed to get backing from much of the entrenched local Democratic Party machinery. A news report concerning his voter-information mailings was released close to the primary election date. It was alleged that Gifford&#x27;s aides initially originally stated the mailings cost only $37,000, but later stated they cost taxpayers $1.6 million (which was well within the average of mailing costs for City Council members). $37,000 would have been by far the lowest of all City Council members. While Miller&#x27;s aide disputed that the figure $37,000 was ever offered, it had already been run as a news story during the election week. Miller also held that his $1.5 million of his fund was exempt from the primary&#x27;s $5.7 million spending limit as it was self-financed which caused a spat with the New York City Campaign Finance Board. While Miller vigorously maintained his position, he ended the dispute by canceling over $500,000 in important final stage advertisements, negating his spending edge. Miller saw much of his potential support drift to Congressman Anthony Weiner. In the end, Miller placed fourth in the primary field with 10.19%.

In the fall of 2006, Miller was a teacher at New York University&#x27;s College of Arts and Science, leading a Freshman Honors Seminar, entitled &quot;Governing Gotham&quot; on public policy and urban planning in New York City. He also runs a strategic consulting firm, Miller Strategies, and a real estate investment firm. Miller serves on the board of a hedge fund and numerous non-profit groups, including Friends of the High Line, NYC Outward Bound and the New York Academy of Medicine.

==Personal life==
He lives in Manhattan with his wife, Pamela Addison, and their two sons, Marshall Legend and Addison Lad.

<text>Evgeny Mikhailovich Lifshitz (; ; 21 February 1915 – 29 October 1985) was a leading Soviet physicist and brother of the physicist Ilya Lifshitz.

==Work==
Born into a Ukrainian Jewish family in Kharkov, Kharkov Governorate, Russian Empire (now Kharkiv, Ukraine). Lifshitz is well known in the field of general relativity for coauthoring the BKL conjecture concerning the nature of a &quot;generic curvature singularity&quot;. , this is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in the subject of classical gravitation.

With Lev Landau, Lifshitz co-authored &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot;, an ambitious series of physics textbooks, in which the two aimed to provide a graduate-level introduction to the entire field of physics. These books are still considered invaluable and continue to be widely used.

Lifshitz was the second of only 43 people ever to pass Landau&#x27;s &quot;Theoretical Minimum&quot; examination. He made many invaluable contributions, in particular to quantum electrodynamics, where he calculated the Casimir force in an arbitrary macroscopic configuration of metals and dielectrics.

Since 1975, a special multicritical point, the &quot;Lifshitz point&quot;, carries his name.

Landau and Lifshitz suggested in the third volume of the &quot;Course of Theoretical Physics&quot; that the then-standard periodic table had a mistake in it, and that lutetium should be regarded as a d-block rather than an f-block element. Their suggestion was fully vindicated by later findings, and in 1988 was endorsed by a report of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

<doc id="713354" wikidata="Q214556" url="?curid=713354" title="Epicycloid">
<text>In geometry, an epicycloid (also called hypercycloid) is a plane curve produced by tracing the path of a chosen point on the circumference of a circle—called an &quot;epicycle&quot;—which rolls without slipping around a fixed circle. It is a particular kind of roulette.

An epicycloid with a minor radius (R2) of 0 is a circle. This is a degenerate form.

==Equations==

If the rolling circle has radius formula_1, and the fixed circle has radius formula_2, then the parametric equations for the curve can be given by either:
:formula_3
or:
:formula_4

This can be written in a more concise form using complex numbers as

:formula_5

where 
* the angle formula_6
* the rolling circle has radius formula_1, and
* the fixed circle has radius formula_8.

==Area and Arc Length==

(Assuming the initial point lies on the larger circle.) When formula_9 is a positive integer, the area formula_10 and arc length formula_11 of this epicycloid are
:formula_12
:formula_13

It means that the epicycloid is formula_14 larger in area than the original stationary circle.

If formula_9 is a positive integer, then the curve is closed, and has cusps (i.e., sharp corners).

If formula_9 is a rational number, say formula_17 expressed as irreducible fraction, then the curve has formula_18 cusps. 

Count the animation rotations to see and 

If formula_9 is an irrational number, then the curve never closes, and forms a dense subset of the space between the larger circle and a circle of radius formula_20.

The distance formula_21 from the origin to the point formula_18 on the small circle varies up and down as

:formula_23
where
*formula_24 = radius of large circle and
*formula_25 = diameter of small circle .

The epicycloid is a special kind of epitrochoid.

An epicycle with one cusp is a cardioid, two cusps is a nephroid.

An epicycloid and its evolute are similar.

==Proof==

We assume that the position of formula_18 is what we want to solve, formula_27 is the angle from the tangential point to the moving point formula_18, and formula_29 is the angle from the starting point to the tangential point.

Since there is no sliding between the two cycles, then we have that
:formula_30
By the definition of angle (which is the rate arc over radius), then we have that
:formula_31 
and 
:formula_32.
From these two conditions, we get the identity
:formula_33. 
By calculating, we get the relation between formula_27 and formula_29, which is
:formula_36. 

From the figure, we see the position of the point formula_18 on the small circle clearly.
:formula_38
:formula_39

<text>Mikhail, or Hamud Bey Sharvashidze-Chachba, from the [[House of Sharvashidze]], (born 1806, died 1866) was the head of state of the Principality of Abkhazia and reigned from 1823 to 1864.

Mikhail, who was Orthodox Christian, came to power at a time when Abkhazia had only recently been declared a protectorate of Russia, as a result of the 1810 manifesto of Tsar Alexander I. During the Crimean War of 1853–55, Abkhazia was invaded by Turkey, and Mikhail was forced to declare his loyalty to Turkey. This came back to haunt him when, in 1864, the Russians accused him of cooperating with Turkey during the war. He was subsequently exiled to Voronezh, in Russia – an act which was vastly unpopular with the Abkhaz people.

Mikhail&#x27;s deportation, and death not long after, also marked the beginning of the end for Abkhazian self-governance for the next 140 years. In June 1864, the Princedom was abolished and replaced by the Sukhumi Military Sector. In 1866, a popular uprising declared Mikhail&#x27;s son Giorgi Prince, but this was short-lived.

<doc id="713369" wikidata="Q14927262" url="?curid=713369" title="Mayor of Toronto">
<text>The mayor of Toronto is the head of Toronto City Council and chief executive officer of the municipal government. The mayor is elected alongside city council every four years on the fourth Monday of October; there are no term limits. While in office, mayors are styled &quot;His/Her Worship&quot;.

Olivia Chow has served as the 66th and current mayor of Toronto since July 12, 2023, after winning the 2023 by-election.

==Role and authority==
The role and powers of the mayor of Toronto are set out in the 1997 &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot;, an Ontario statute, and its update in 2006. It outlines the mayor&#x27;s role as head of council and chief executive officer of the City of Toronto. In September 2022, the province passed legislation known as the &quot;Strong Mayors, Building More Homes Act, 2022&quot;, followed by the &quot;Better Municipal Governance Act, 2022&quot;, both of which expanded the executive power of the mayor.

As head of council, the mayor is responsible for ensuring business is carried out efficiently during council meetings. This has been delegated to the speaker of Toronto City Council, however, the mayor retains the ability to take over as chair during council meetings. Items can be added by the mayor directly to city council&#x27;s agenda without going through a committee. Additionally, the mayor also holds &quot;ex officio&quot; membership on all council committees, chairs the Executive Committee, Striking Committee and the Civic Appointments Committee. The mayor has the power to appoint the chairs of other city committees as well as the deputy mayor. With the consent of the mayor, another member of council may take the mayor&#x27;s place on committees. The head of council is also responsible for declaring states of emergency in the city.

Before the passage of the &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot;, Toronto&#x27;s government operated on what has been described as a &quot;weak-mayor&quot; system where all powers were vested in Council as a whole. In order to advance policy objectives, the mayor had to act as a consensus builder. The &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot; shifted Toronto&#x27;s government structure into one which resembles a &quot;strong-mayor&quot; system, assigning several administrative powers to the mayor which were previously held by City Council or an officer of the city.

The &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot; expands the mayor&#x27;s role in managing City Council&#x27;s committee system and the overall organization of the city. Much of the work of the council is done in committees. The mayor sets out this structure by creating and dissolving committees, appoints their chairs and vice-chairs (this is a power that was delegated by council before 2022), and assigning their functions. Without the need for a motion by council, city staff can also be directed by the mayor to produce reports, develop policy and provide advice for city council to consider.

The mayor is also responsible for determining the organizational structure of the city. This includes the ability to create or dissolve city divisions, and appoint or terminate executive staff such as the city manager (who is the chief administrative officer) and the heads of city divisions.

Developing the annual budget of the City of Toronto is another key function of the mayor. Previously, the power to set the budget was a function of city council, which was assigned to the Budget Committee, allowing the mayor to exercise significant influence on the budget process. The power to draft the annual city budget is now assigned to the mayor. The mayor proposes the budget to council, which can adopt it or propose amendments.

Certain powers of the mayor can only be exercised in order to &quot;advance provincial priorities&quot;, as outlined in the &quot;Better Municipal Governance Act&quot;, the &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot; and through regulation. While city by-law allows the mayor to add items directly to council&#x27;s agenda, this power is expanded by the &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot;, which asserts that the mayor can do so to advance a provincial priority, irrespective of council&#x27;s procedural by-law. The mayor is also granted a veto, which would allow an override of a city council decision if it is not consistent with a provincial priority, however, council can override the mayor&#x27;s veto with a two-thirds majority vote. The &quot;Better Municipal Governance Act&quot;, which was passed shortly after the &quot;Strong Mayors Act&quot; further expands this power, allowing the mayor to pass a by-law for the purpose of advancing a provincial priority with one-third support on council. The provincial priorities are set by the Executive Council of Ontario (provincial cabinet), through issuing regulations.

== Deputy mayor ==

City councillors may be appointed by the mayor to exercise statutory powers assigned to the mayor, or on an honorary basis.

=== Statutory deputy mayor ===
The first deputy mayor performs the statutory roles and functions assigned to the &quot;deputy mayor&quot; as defined in various chapters of the municipal code. The first deputy mayor is a member of council who is appointed to the role by the mayor, and assists him/her as vice-chair of the executive committee and acts as mayor when the mayor is away, ill or the office of the mayor is vacant. The deputy mayor has all the rights, power and authority of the mayor, save and except the &quot;by-right-of-office powers&quot; of the mayor as a member of a community council.

==== Role of mayor vacancy ====
When the office of Mayor of Toronto is vacant, the deputy mayor assumes limited mayoral powers which are granted to the mayor by city council, to ensure city business can continue to be carried out. This includes acting as the city&#x27;s chief executive officer, representing the city, and special privileges during council sessions. The deputy mayor also assumes responsibility for the administrative management of the mayor&#x27;s office.

The deputy mayor does not become &quot;acting&quot; or &quot;interim&quot; mayor, nor does the deputy mayor assume the &quot;strong-mayor&quot; powers, which are granted by the province to the head of council, a role which remains vacant.

=== Non-statutory deputy mayors ===
In 2014, city council approved the creation of three additional non-statutory deputy mayor positions. Non-statutory deputy mayors are members of council, appointed by the mayor, who advise him/her on local issues and represent him/her at events and ceremonies. Each (along with the first deputy mayor) represent a geographic area of the city, and are responsible for a specific policy role. The deputy mayors and the mayor meet each month to discuss efforts to bring the city together.

==History==

From 1834 to 1857, and again from 1867 to 1873, Toronto mayors were not elected directly by the public. Instead, after each annual election of aldermen and councilmen, the assembled council would elect one of their members as mayor. For all other years, mayors were directly elected by popular vote, except in rare cases where a mayor was appointed by council to fill an unexpired term of office. Prior to 1834, Toronto municipal leadership was governed by the chairman of the General Quarter Session of Peace of the Home District Council.

Through 1955 the term of office for the mayor and council was one year; it then varied between two and three years until a four-year term was adopted starting in 2006. (See List of Toronto municipal elections.)

The City of Toronto has changed substantially over the years: the city annexed or amalgamated with neighbouring communities or areas 49 times from in 1883 to 1967. The most sweeping change was in 1998, when the six municipalities comprising Metropolitan Toronto—East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, York, and the former city of Toronto–and its regional government were amalgamated into a single City of Toronto (colloquially dubbed the &quot;megacity&quot;) by an act of the provincial government. The newly created position of mayor for the resulting single-tier mega-city replaced all of the mayors of the former Metro municipalities. It also abolished the office of the Metro chairman, which had formerly been the most senior political figure in the Metro government before amalgamation.

Fourteen out of the first 29 mayors were lawyers, and 58 of Toronto&#x27;s 64 mayors (up to Ford) have been Protestant, white, English-speaking, Anglo-Saxon, property-owning males. There have been two women (Hall and Rowlands) and three Jewish mayors (Phillips, Givens and Lastman).

Art Eggleton is the longest-serving mayor of Toronto, serving from 1980 until 1991. Eggleton later served in federal politics from 1993 until 2004, and was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 2005. David Breakenridge Read held the post of mayor of Toronto for the shortest period. Read was mayor for only fifty days in 1858.

No Toronto mayor has been removed from office. Toronto&#x27;s 64th mayor, Rob Ford, lost a conflict of interest trial in 2012, and was ordered to vacate his position; but the ruling was stayed pending an appeal, which Ford won to remain in office. Due to his substance abuse admission and controversy in 2013, Council stripped him of many powers on November 15, transferring them to the deputy mayor. From May until July 2014, Ford took a leave of absence from the mayoralty to enter drug rehabilitation.

==Post-amalgamation mayors of Toronto==

The current City of Toronto was formed in 1998 from the amalgamation of Metro Toronto and its constituent municipalities. The following is a list of mayors of the current post-amalgamation Toronto.

<doc id="713375" wikidata="Q1540328" url="?curid=713375" title="My Stepmother Is an Alien">
<text>My Stepmother Is an Alien is a 1988 American science fiction comedy film directed by Richard Benjamin. It stars Dan Aykroyd, Kim Basinger, Jon Lovitz, and Alyson Hannigan. The film follows the story of Celeste, an extraterrestrial woman who is sent on a secret mission to Earth, after her home planet&#x27;s gravity is mistakenly disrupted by Steven Mills, a widowed scientist raising his daughter Jessie as a single father. The film was the film debut of Juliette Lewis.

The screenplay was written by Herschel Weingrod, Timothy Harris, and Jonathan Reynolds, based on an earlier script by Jericho Stone. Stone had originally pitched the film to Paramount Pictures as a drama that would serve as an allegory for child abuse. When Paramount optioned the story, they suggested that it would be more believable as a comedy. The film was unproduced for four years until Weintraub Entertainment Group put it into production in 1988.

&quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; was a box-office bomb, grossing only $13.8 million against a $19 million budget. The film also received negative reviews from critics, with most of the responses panning the film&#x27;s humor and screenplay. Basinger and costar Lovitz received generally favorable reviews for their comedic performances, but in a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Aykroyd was singled out for criticism for his performance as a romantic lead.

==Plot==
Steven Mills is a widowed scientist working on different ways to send radio waves into deep space. After he sends a radio wave out of the galaxy, it hits a planet (Cosine N to the 8th), causing a disruption of gravity on the planet. Celeste is sent to investigate who could have done it and how it was done, believing it was an attack. She is aided by a device called Bag: an alien tentacle with a single eye and a mind of its own disguised as a designer purse. Bag is able to create any object, such as diamonds and designer dresses, almost instantaneously. Celeste crashes a party hosted by Steven&#x27;s brother, Ron, and immediately draws attention to herself by making outdated references to TV shows and political slogans under the mistaken belief that they are current (information that had actually taken 92 years to get from Earth to her home world).

Celeste&#x27;s inexperience almost results in her exposing herself as alien as she struggles with simple tasks such as cooking and trying to kiss for the first time. She goes home with Steven and spends the night (after Bag teaches her what sex is, which she greatly enjoys to the extent that fireworks appear above her during the experience). Jessie, Steven&#x27;s 13-year-old daughter, is at first happy that her father has found someone (her mother having died five years previously) but becomes suspicious when she observes Celeste eating the acid out of batteries and pulling eggs out of boiling hot water with her bare hands. She unsuccessfully tries to convince her smitten father that something is unusual about Celeste. When Celeste tells him that she must leave in 24 hours, he impulsively proposes and she accepts. Ron also has his doubts about Celeste and tries to dissuade Steven from marrying her on the idea she is an illegal immigrant or planning economic espionage, but then admits he is just jealous his brother has found his dream girl, whereas he will never find a girl like Princess Stéphanie of Monaco.

Celeste begins enjoying life as a human as she encounters new experiences such as sneezing and love. When Jessie finally confronts her about being an extraterrestrial, Celeste admits her home world has no emotion and that she plans to depart once she gets Steven to recreate the radio signal and send it (which she says will reverse the gravity problems on her world). That said, she begins to question her decisions when Jessie says it will devastate her father for whom Celeste has now developed feelings. After Jessie argues with Steven, she runs away and is nearly hit by a car but is saved by Celeste, who reveals her powers in the process. Steven accepts that Celeste is indeed an alien and that she has fallen in love with him and sees Jessie as her daughter. He further integrates her to human society by showing her how to eat real food.

Steven figures out how to recreate the radio wave and saves Celeste&#x27;s planet. Bag, however, had been sent to Earth to destroy it and eliminate the danger to Celeste&#x27;s world entirely. After throwing Bag into the power field of the wave transmitter (destroying Bag), the leaders of Celeste&#x27;s home world report in and tell her to finish Bag&#x27;s job. Steven and Celeste manage to convince them it was an accident, not an act of aggression, and that Earth has many benefits that require further studying. They accept the explanation and demand that Celeste return to explain human culture to them. Not wanting to leave, Celeste negotiates having a native of Earth become an ambassador to their world as a token of goodwill. Ron is selected and accepts; he departs for Celeste&#x27;s world in a spaceship served by several flight attendants, all of whom look like Princess Stéphanie (who are enchanted by Ron&#x27;s classic car, which he takes with him).

== Cast ==
==Production==
===Development and writing===
Screenwriter Jericho Stone developed the story under the working title &quot;They’re Coming&quot; as a drama, an allegory about child abuse. He pitched this version of the story to Paramount Pictures in 1981. Paramount agreed to option the story and paid him to write the screenplay, but felt it would be more believable as a comedy. On June 20, 1984, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Catalina Production Group was planning to start principal photography on &quot;They&#x27;re Coming&quot; in late 1984 for Paramount, naming the screenwriters as Stone and Richard Benner; actresses considered for the lead by Paramount included Bette Midler, Shelley Long, Julie Andrews and Raquel Welch. Subsequently, the production moved to 20th Century Fox, which hired Herschel Weingrod and Timothy Harris to rewrite the screenplay. Fox considered Cybill Shepherd and Joan Rivers for the role, but ultimately never produced the film, and it went into turnaround to Weintraub Entertainment Group, where the title was changed to &quot;Two Kids&quot;.

Director Richard Benjamin read an unfinished version of the screenplay in the early 1980s, but did not become interested in the project until reading a completed draft he received via Weintraub in 1987, and agreed to direct. From Benjamin&#x27;s recollection, Stone&#x27;s original screenplay resembled a horror film. By 1988, the screenplay had received further rewriting by Jonathan Reynolds. Stone was ultimately credited only for the story, under his first name, Jericho. The film went into principal photography on February 29, 1988, and wrapped in May of that year; the total cost of production and marketing was reported as $26 million, with $19 million representing the production costs. Some scenes were filmed at Van Nuys High School and Anaheim Stadium.

Don Correia served as the choreographer for &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;. Micaela Esdra dubbed for Kim Basinger in Italian while Choi Seong-woo dubbed for Basinger for South Korean audiences.

The soundtrack album was released by Polydor Records.

Dan Aykroyd and Kim Basinger performed impressions of Jimmy Durante from &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; singing &quot;Did You Ever Have the Feeling&quot; in &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;.

== Release ==
A July press release for the film stated that &quot;My Stepmother Is An Alien&quot; would be released on November 23, 1988, but it was later pushed to December 9. The film premiered on December 3, 1988, in Washington, D.C., an event attended by stars Aykroyd and Basinger, as well as President-elect George H. W. Bush, future First Lady Barbara Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle. Upon general release, Mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley declared December 9 &quot;Stepmother Day&quot;, to honor the &quot;importance, dedication, and contribution of stepmothers everywhere&quot;, and an appreciation of the film shooting in Los Angeles.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened at number seven, grossing $2,066,980 in the opening weekend. It went on to gross $13,854,000 in the United States, becoming a box-office failure.

===Critical response===

The film was met with negative reviews. Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;Basinger gets most of the good comic moments in the movie and does with them what she can, but Benjamin and his writers seem to have run short of invention. Most of the plot developments are foregone conclusions, and most of the big set pieces (like a wedding) are handled routinely, without inspiration.&quot; Janet Maslin, reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, panned the film&#x27;s screenplay and humor, as well as the performance of Dan Aykroyd, who she felt was not only miscast as the film&#x27;s romantic lead, but also unfunny. However, Maslin praised the performances of Kim Basinger and Jon Lovitz, whose character she categorized as a &quot;scene-stealing sleazeball&quot;.

In a generally favorable review, Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s sex humor, calling it &quot;needlessly crass&quot;, but overall praised the film, writing, &quot;&quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; is solid, wide-appeal holiday fare. It makes the best use of Aykroyd&#x27;s warmth and proven talents in quite some time, and it does even more for Basinger, showing that she can be as funny and smart as she is sexy.&quot; The &quot;Radio Times&quot; gave the film three out of five stars, writing, &quot;Fine moments of inspired lunacy jostle with predictably slight comic relief, but Basinger&#x27;s eager-to-please freshness and verve make this intergalactic muddle impossible to dislike.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;failed attempt to mix many of the film genres associated with the &#x27;alien&#x27; idea into a sprightly romp.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film one star, calling it &quot;A standard formula comedy [which] tries to emulate popular alien-on-Earth films like &quot;Starman&quot;. Had it actually been told from the perspective of the scientist&#x27;s daughter, as the title suggests, it might have been more appealing, but instead a predictable, amateurish script shifts the focus elsewhere.&quot; Writing in &quot;People&quot;, Peter Travers said that director Richard Benjamin &quot;tries to disguise the threadbare plot with explosions and special-effects hardware&quot;, and called the film &quot;a clanking bore, except for Basinger—a potential star still waiting for the vehicle that will let her shine. Her comic talent glimmers in a scene where she learns what a kiss is.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote, &quot;The film offers several entertaining sequences, [but &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot;] is marred by cruel and juvenile gags.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 20% based on reviews from 25 critics, with an average rating of 4/10. The consensus states: &quot;Kim Basinger is otherworldly funny in this harebrained sci-fi rom com, but she still can&#x27;t save &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; from alienating intelligent earthlings.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on scale of A to F.

==Namesake==
A South Korean branch of Baskin-Robbins released an ice cream flavor called &quot;Mom is an alien&quot; named after the movie.
