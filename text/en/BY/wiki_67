<text>Kiveton Park is a village within the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, in South Yorkshire, England. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, from the Norman conquest to 1868, Kiveton was a hamlet of the parish of Harthill-with-Woodall. It subsequently transferred to the civil parish of Wales which takes its name from the neighbouring village.

==Geography==
Kiveton Park is located at approximately , at an elevation of around above sea level, and is located west of Worksop, and south-east of both Sheffield, and Rotherham respectively. It lies on the B6059 road (Station Road) and is served by two railway stations: Kiveton Bridge and Kiveton Park. The Chesterfield Canal lies to the south, while the villages of Todwick and South Anston are to the north and east. Kiveton Park lays claim to being in Rotherham Borough Council, has a Sheffield postcode, a Worksop telephone code, and has the Chesterfield Canal running through it. The village has two railway stations: Kiveton Bridge railway station in the centre of the village; and Kiveton Park railway station.

==History==

Kiveton gets its name from the Anglo-Saxon for &quot;the settlement in the hollow&quot;. In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; it is written &quot;Ciuetone&quot;, and was under the ownership of William de Warenne. 

It subsequently transferred to the &quot;de Keuton&quot; family, who sold the estate to the heirs of the former Lord Mayor of London Sir William Hewett (of the neighbouring hamlet of Wales, died 1567) in 1580. One of his descendants was Thomas Osborne who became the first Duke of Leeds. He arranged the building of a stately home in the village, Kiveton Hall (also spelled Keveton, Keeton or Keton Hall), in 1698. 

The building was demolished by George William Frederick Osborne, 6th Duke of Leeds in 1812, with local legend stating that the demolition was the result of a bet with the then Prince of Wales (subsequently George IV of the United Kingdom). After Kiveton Hall was demolished, Hornby Castle became the main seat of the Dukes of Leeds. The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Leeds was All Hallows Church, Harthill.

A Community History Project has been set up to record and encourage an understanding of the history of Kiveton Park and neighbouring Wales, particularly mining heritage. This was based in the Old Colliery Offices.

==Economy==

Coal mining has traditionally been the principal industry of Kiveton, and dates back to the Middle Ages. Much of the coal is near to the surface, and as early as 1598, the area was extracting 2,000 tons a year. 

By the middle of the 19th century, the coal-fields were being served both by canal and by rail, and in 1866, the Kiveton Park Colliery was sunk, making it one of the earliest deep mines in the world. As a result of the new colliery, the population of Kiveton increased from 300 to 1,400 over a period of ten years. The pit closed in 1994, resulting in the loss of 1,000 jobs. As a consequence, Kiveton is now essentially a commuter base for adjacent towns.

Kiveton contains a steelworks at the bottom of Redhill, which was damaged by fire on 27 August 2009.

All of the colliery buildings have since been demolished, including the originally protected pit-head baths (built in 1938), with the exception of the 1870s office building with its gothic clock tower, which still remains. The Kiveton Park and Wales Community Development Trust uses the office building as a base. The trust&#x27;s aims are to provide services and increase development within the community sector.

==Sport==
Kiveton&#x27;s sporting history extends back to 1879, when Kiveton Park Colliery Cricket Club was formed. The club has been a member of the Bassetlaw and District Cricket League since its inception in 1904. The first team did compete in an ECB Premier League competition (the Nottinghamshire Premier League) for the 2011 season after winning the Bassetlaw League a year earlier, but were relegated back after one year.

In 1881, Kiveton Park Football Club was formed. The club has played in the FA Cup and FA Vase on numerous occasions. They currently play in the Sheffield County Senior League, having previously been members of the Yorkshire League, Northern Counties East League and the Central Midlands League.

The village is the birthplace of football manager Herbert Chapman, and his brother Harry, a Sheffield Wednesday player. At one time the village football club was reputed to have produced more professional footballers than any place its size in England, with the Chapman brothers, Derek Ashton (Aston Villa), Bert Morley (Notts County and England), Sidney Cartwright (Arsenal), Leslie Hoften (Manchester United), Eric Oakton (Chelsea) and Walter Wigmore (Birmingham City) all coming from the village.

Patrick Barclay, in his book about Herbert Chapman, wrote: &quot;Kiveton Park could claim to have been a cradle of two revolutions, one industrial and the other sporting, and beyond question it is the birthplace of at least one great man, widely considered the father of football as we have come to know it. &quot;

Motorcycle rider James Toseland grew up in Kiveton Park. He was a two times World Superbike Champion in 2004 and 2007.

==Radio==
Following broadcasts since 2000, on Saturday 27 March 2010 Kiveton gained its own community radio station on a 5-year licence under Redroad FM on 102.4Â FM. This licence was extended again by OFCOM in 2015 to 2020.

<text>The Seattle Public Library (SPL) is the public library system serving the city of Seattle, Washington. Efforts to start a Seattle library had commenced as early as 1868, with the system eventually being established by the city in 1890. The system currently comprises 27 branches, most of which are named after the neighborhoods in which they are located. The Seattle Public Library also includes Mobile Services and the Central Library, which was designed by Rem Koolhaas and opened in 2004. The Seattle Public Library also founded the Washington Talking Book &amp; Braille Library (WTBBL), which it administered until July 2008.

All but one of Seattle&#x27;s early purpose-built libraries were Carnegie libraries. Although the central Carnegie library has since been replaced twice, all the purpose-built branches from the early 20th century survive; however, some have undergone significant alterations. Ballard&#x27;s former Carnegie library has since housed a number of restaurants and antique stores among other enterprises, while others such as the Fremont and Green Lake branches have been modernized and remain in use as libraries.

As of 2023, the library served 293,000 active patrons, 75,000 new cardholders, 124,000 borrowers of physical materials, and 175,000 borrowers of digital materials. The library answered 234,000 assisted information questions, and it hosted 3,500 classes, events and activities, as well as 341,000 public computer sessions.

==Collections and services==
As of 2023, the Seattle Public Library contained 1.8 million physical items, with 1 million at the Central Library and 814,000 catalogued at the other 26 branches. The total physical collection includes 4.7 million printed books and other printed items; 1.2 million CDs, DVDs, and audiobooks; and 42,000 other items, including laptops, tablets, Wi-Fi hotspots, and Kill A Watt power meters.

As of 2011, its special collections include an oral history collection, the state document depository, the federal document depository, an aviation history collection, genealogy records, and historical documents about Seattle. A room on the seventh floor of the Central Library houses the ZAPP Zine Collection, over 30,000 zines donated by Richard Hugo House, where it used to constitute the Zine Archive and Publishing Project collection. In addition all locations have uncatalogued collections of books that can be borrowed without a library card.

The library also has extensive online resources, which as of 2023 include, among other things, access to historic archives of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, &quot;Seattle Daily Journal of Commerce&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as well as the Britannica Library, Kanopy (video streaming), and ProQuest (academic research), plus access to several e-book collections. In 2023, the library circulated 7.4 million digital items, including 5.5 million e-book and e-audiobooks. Through Books Unbanned, these online resources are available to youth ages 13 to 21 throughout the United States.

==History==

===Late 19th century: founding===
Seattle&#x27;s first attempt to start a library association occurred at a meeting of 50 residents on July 30, 1868, but produced only minimal success over the next two decades. The Ladies&#x27; Library Association began a more focused attempt to put together a public library in 1888. They had raised some funds and had even obtained a pledge of land from Henry Yesler, but their efforts were cut short by the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. Nonetheless, encouraged by their ideas, the revised October 1890 city charter formally established the Public Library as a branch of the city government. The ladies&#x27; influence can be seen in that the charter required that at least two of the five library commissioners be women. The library was funded by a 10% share of city fines, penalties, and licenses.

The first library opened April 8, 1891 as a reading room on the third floor of the Occidental Blockâlater the Seattle Hotelâsupervised by librarian A. J. Snoke. By December 1891 when books were first allowed to be borrowed, it had 6,541 volumes. Snoke was succeeded in 1893 by John D. Atkinson, who was succeeded in 1895 by Charles Wesley Smith, who remained in the position until 1907. Smith took over a library that, like all of Seattle, had been seriously impacted by the Panic of 1893: by 1895 its annual budget was only half of what it had been that first year.

In its first decade or so, the growing library &quot;developed the traveling habit&quot;. In June 1894, it moved across Second Avenue to the Collins Block. By 1895, the budget situation was so dire that Smith initially experimented with charging borrowers ten cents to borrow a book; the experiment was a failure and in 1896 the library moved to the Rialto, a building farther north on Second Avenue, far enough north that at that time it stood outside of Seattle&#x27;s core. As the city grew out, that building was later occupied by the Frederick and Nelson department store. At the Rialto, the library for the first time moved to an open-stacks policy, where users could browse through the shelves for themselves instead of presenting a request to a librarian. In 1898 the library moved again to the former Yesler Mansion, a forty-room building on the site that would later become the King County Courthouse.

Meanwhile, in 1896, the library established a bindery, and a new city charter drastically decreased the power of the library commission and removed the requirement of its having female members. This greatly increased Smith&#x27;s power, a change which he himself opposed; in 1902 a new Library Board would be established, again gaining supervisory rather than merely advisory power.

===Early 20th century: the first great era of growth===
On the night of January 1, 1901, the Yesler Mansion burned taking most of the library collection with it. The library records were salvaged, along with the 2,000 volumes of the children&#x27;s collection. Other than those, though, practically the only books salvaged were the 5,000 that were out on circulation at the time. The library operated for a time out of Yesler&#x27;s barn, which had survived, then moved to a building that had been left behind when the University of Washington had moved from downtown to its present campus. By January 6, Andrew Carnegie had promised $200,000 to build a new Seattle library; he later added another $20,000 when this budget proved inadequate.

The new Carnegie library was built not far from the former university campus, occupying the entire block between 4th and 5th Avenues and between Madison and Spring Streets. The land was purchased for $100,000. In August 1903, the city selected a design submitted by P. J. Weber of Chicago for a building to be constructed largely of sandstone. Ground was broken in spring 1905 and the library was dedicated December 19, 1906. Shortly after moving to these new permanent quarters, Smith was succeeded in 1907 by Judson T. Jennings.

Meanwhile, the library began to grow in other respects. A reference department had been established in 1899. In 1903 a position was established for a children&#x27;s librarian. In 1904 a plan was established to grow eventually to 12 departments. The periodical division was established in 1906, the art division in 1907, and the technology division in 1912. Branch libraries had opened in rented quarters in Fremont (1903), Green Lake (1905), and the University District (1908). In 1908, Carnegie donated $105,000 to build permanent branches in the University District, Green Lake, and West Seattle (all of which opened in summer 1910). The annexation by Seattle of the city of Ballard brought with it another already established Carnegie library, and a further Carnegie donation of $70,000 in 1911 built the Queen Anne branch (opened 1914) and the Columbia Branch (opened December 31, 1915 in Columbia City). The land in the Central District donated by Henry Yesler to the Ladies&#x27; Library Association was traded to the parks department and the money was city funds were used to buy land and erect a library about east of downtown and named after Yesler. It was later renamed as the DouglassâTruth Branch Library.

The 1921 opening of the permanent Fremont branchâalso funded with Carnegie moneyâbrought this era of great expansion to an end. It would be over three decades before The Seattle Public Library opened another proper branch.
Even as early as 1915, the library was collecting books not only in English but in many other languages spoken in Seattle (though all of the languages collected at that time were European: there were as yet no Asian language collections). In 1915, the library had collections in Croatian, &quot;Dano-Norwegian&quot; (BokmÃ¥l), Finnish, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Modern Greek, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Yiddish. Ten other languages were also lightly represented.&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle also had established one of only three collections for the blind in the country west of the Mississippi River, the other two being in San Francisco and Portland, Oregon. In 1915 this collection had 698 volumes.

In 1916, 67,097 people borrowed books from the library. That was 19 per cent of the population of the city. At that time the system appears to have had more total points of contact with the public than today, though few of these were proper branches. A civics textbook from the era indicates the library&#x27;s points of contact with the public as &quot;the central library, 9 branch libraries, 8 drug store deposit stations, 32 fire-engine houses, 420 school rooms in 77 schools, 3 play grounds and 8 special deposit stations.&quot;

===Mid 20th century stagnation===

Seattle suffered heavily in the Great Depression. The Library&#x27;s official website describes the Library as having been &quot;pummeled&quot; in this period of &quot;soaring demands and evaporating resources&quot;. In 1930, a 10-year-plan announced an &quot;urgent&quot; need for a $1.2 million bond issue to expand the Central Library. In the event, nothing of the sort happened. During the Depression, the Central Library became a refuge for the jobless. Library circulation hit record heights, passing 4 million in 1932. Meanwhile, budgets were cut, employees were laid off, and programs were terminated. The Library&#x27;s 1939 budget was $40,000 less than its 1931 budget.

The Library&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1941 occasioned the foundation of Friends of The Seattle Public Library. The economic revival brought about by World War II, and the post-war prosperity, began to bring the library out of its institutional stagnation. Seattle spent $400,000 on a book stack addition to the Central Library in 1949, and three modern new branch libraries were built in 1954. Nonetheless, the library was simply not used nearly as much in this era as in the Depression years. While the city&#x27;s population had grown from 368,000 to 463,000 since 1932, only 2.4 million books were being borrowed annually, as against over 4 million. Bond issue votes to build a more modern central library failed in 1950 and 1952.

At mid-century, The Seattle Public Library had numerous &quot;book stations&quot; for areas with no branch as such, in locations such as a &quot;rented shop space, clubhouse, or hospital,&quot; each with a small, frequently changing collection of books. These book stations were open half-time, and serves one-sixth as many readers as the branch libraries. A bookmobile with 2,500 books serviced two dozen other locations. Also, at this time The Seattle Public Library was a mainstay of the King County Library System (then known as the King County Rural Library District), with 70,000 book loans in 1948 to King County patrons outside the city.

By mid-century, The Seattle Public Library circulated a lot more than books. Even in its early years, the library collection had included items such as sheet music. By 1948, the circulating collection included 3,500 phonograph records, which were borrowed a total of 53,000 times that year, as well as 6,000 pieces of sheet music, 6,000 song books and piano albums, 200 reproductions of famous paintings, and 27,000 other pictures. In 1950, the library subscribed to 200 newspapers (mostly from Washington State) and 1,700 periodicals.

===The 1960s===
The city finally passed its first-ever library bond issue in 1956. This funded, among other things, a new $4.5 million, central library, designed in the International style by the Seattle firm of Bindon &amp; Wright, and built on the same site as its Carnegie predecessor. Dedicated March 26, 1960, it featured the first-ever escalator in an American library, a drive-up window for book pick-ups and was Seattle&#x27;s first public building to incorporate significant new works of art. Among the artists represented were James FitzGerald, Glen Alps, and Ray Jensen. It also incorporated a fountain by sculptor George Tsutakawa, the first of many fountains Tsutakawa would construct over the remainder of his career.

The new library energized the public library system. The library&#x27;s official web site writes that &quot;the atmosphere in the opening weeks was likened to a department store during the holiday shopping season. The new Central Library loaned out almost 1 million volumes in its first nine months, a 31 percent increase over the previous year&#x27;s circulation.&quot; A library that had been &quot;struggling with disinterest in a shabby headquarters&quot; now found itself &quot;loved to tatters,&quot; with greater demand than it could readily satisfy.

The 1956 bond issue also provided $500,000 for branch libraries. This paid for the construction of the Southwest Branch (1961), a new Ballard Branch (1963; later Abraxus Books), and the Magnolia Branch (1964). The Magnolia Branch was designed by Paul Hayden Kirk and incorporates the Japanese influences found in much Northwest architecture of the era. The bond issue also bought the land for the Broadview Branch, but did not provide the funds to build it; that branch finally opened in 1976.

===Late 20th century: Recession and recovery===
In the 1970s and into the 1980s, The Seattle Public Library experienced another period of tight budgets and constricted services, but the picture was never as bleak as in the Great Depression. In 1975 the Yesler Branchâearlier in danger of closingâwas renamed as the Douglass-Truth Branch, honoring Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. That branch features an extensive African American collection.

A $2.3 million federal grant refurbished and expanded public areas of the Central Library in 1979. Another federal grant gave $1.2 million for the Rainier Beach Branch (1981). In the late 1980s, a $4.6 million project restored the Library&#x27;s six Carnegie branches; this project was recognized with an honor from the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Meanwhile, capping the career of Library Board president Virginia Burnside, The Seattle Public Library Foundation was established in 1980 to increase outside financial support of the Library. By the mid-1990s, during the dot-com boom years, annual donations exceeded $1 million, while library circulation passed 5 million items annually.

===1998âpresent: &quot;Libraries for All&quot;===
In 1998, Seattle voters, with an unprecedented 69 percent approval rate, approved the largest library bond issue then ever submitted in the United States. The $196 million &quot;Libraries for All&quot; bond measure, along with private funds raised by The Seattle Public Library Foundation, nearly doubled the square footage in Seattle&#x27;s libraries, including the building of new branches and a new Central Library.

As of 2006, The Seattle Public Library system had 699 staff members (538 full-time equivalents). It circulated 3,151,840 adult books, 1,613,979 children&#x27;s books, 570,316 WTBBL materials, and 3,895,444 other media (CDs, DVDs, videotapes, etc.) Staff members answered more than 1 million reference questions. The system also provides 1,134 public computers. Anyone with a library card can get up to one and a half hour a day of free computer use; the system accepts reservations for a computer at a particular time at a particular branch.

The library has moved to an RFID system for materials, which allows people to check out their materials without assistance, freeing librarians to focus on matters other than circulation.

From 1993 to 2004, the library was home to Nancy Pearl, one of the few celebrity librarians in the English-speaking world. Pearl&#x27;s &quot;Book Lust&quot; book series and her much-imitated &quot;If All Seattle Read the Same Book&quot; project (now called &quot;Seattle Reads&quot;) resulted in her being perhaps the only librarian who has ever been honored with an action figure.

After the Great Recession resulted in eight separate operating budget cuts between 2009 and 2012, in November 2012 Seattle voters passed a 7-year levy to restore services. The levy enabled all branches to provide Sunday service (15 previously did not), increased the number of branches with 7-day-a-week service from 12 to 14, added to the maintenance and repair fund, and provided new funds to purchase physical materials, electronic content, and additional computer equipment.

The library unveiled its proposed rebranding strategy in September 2015, including a new name and new logo, that attracted widespread controversy over its cost; the first phase of the project cost $365,000 and the total cost would have been $1.3 million out of private donations. The board of trustees ultimately rejected the proposal on October 28, 2015, citing negative public feedback and other pressing uses for the funds.

A $219 million property tax levy was approved by Seattle voters in August 2019 to fund library services, including extended hours at branches, seismic renovations, social services. The levy also included funding to eliminate overdue fines for patrons, which came into effect on January 2, 2020.

During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the library closed all of its branches and in-person services, operating exclusively with curbside pickup at some locations beginning in August. Five branches were reopened in April to provide public bathrooms to unsheltered and homeless people in the city, but other services remained closed. The first branches reopened on April 27, 2021, and the final branch reopened in October. The library system incurred an estimated $434,188 in property damage during the pandemic, particularly at the Central Library.

The library&#x27;s checkout and online services were shut down by a ransomware attack in late May 2024 after a period of scheduled maintenance. Branch services remained open and some online services were restored by May 29. By August, most online services had been restored, with the goal of all online services being available by the end of August.

==Architecture==
Many of The Seattle Public Library&#x27;s facilities are notable works of architecture. They reflect the aesthetics of several very different periods. The various former Carnegie libraries and the Douglass-Truth library all date from a single period of two decades in the early 20th century. No further branch libraries were built between 1921 and 1954, and when branch construction resumed, the International style had swept away the earlier revivalism. Today&#x27;s Greenwood and North East branches are both expanded versions of 1954 libraries, the latter originally designed by Paul Thiry; a third library from 1954, the Susan J. Henry branch on Capitol Hill, has been entirely replaced, as has Bindon &amp; Wright&#x27;s 1960 Central Library.

The Seattle Central Library opened in 2004 and was designed by Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus of the Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) in a joint venture with LMN Architects and Facade Consultants. In 2007, the building was voted #108 on the American Institute of Architects&#x27; (AIA) list of Americans&#x27; 150 favorite structures in the U.S. The building received a 2005 national AIA Honor Award for Architecture.

Six current Seattle branch libraries are on the National Register of Historic Places: Columbia (architects: Harlan P. Thomas and W. Marbury Somervell), Fremont (architect: Daniel Riggs Huntington), Green Lake (architects: W. Marbury Somervell &amp; ), Queen Anne (architects: Harlan P. Thomas and W. Marbury Somervell), University (architects: Somervell &amp; Joseph S. Cote), and West Seattle (architects: W. Marbury Somervell &amp; Joseph S. Cote). The original Ballard branch (architect: Henderson Ryan) also shares this status, as does the old Wallingford Fire and Police Station (architect: Daniel Riggs Huntington), which housed a branch library from 1986 to 2000.

In addition, several buildings have been designated as landmarks by the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board: Columbia, Douglass-Truth, Fremont, Green Lake, Lake City, Magnolia, North East, Queen Anne, University, and West Seattle.

The new Ballard Branch is also one of the first buildings in Seattle to incorporate green architecture. The library is equipped with solar panels to reduce its electricity demands, as well as a green roof, which provides insulation to the building, and also serves to reduce stormwater runoff.

<text>The push-up (press-up in British English) is a common calisthenics exercise beginning from the prone position. By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the pectoral muscles, triceps, and anterior deltoids, with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, serratus anterior, coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or physical education and commonly in military physical training. It is also a common form of punishment used in the military, school sport, and some martial arts disciplines for its humiliating factor (when one fails to do a specified amount) and for its lack of equipment. Variations of push-ups, such as wide-arm push-ups, diamond push-ups target specific muscle groups and provide further challenges.

==Etymology==
The American English term &quot;push-up&quot; was first used between 1905 and 1910, while the British &quot;press-up&quot; was first recorded was 1920.

==Body mass supported during push-ups==
According to the study published in &quot;The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&quot;, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of their body mass in the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where knees are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of their body mass in up and down positions, respectively.

==Muscles worked==
While the push-up primarily targets the muscles of the chest, arms, and shoulders, support required from other muscles results in a wider range of muscles integrated into the exercise.

=== Abdominals ===
The rectus abdominis and transversus abdominis contract continually while performing push-ups to hold the body off the floor and keep the legs and torso aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The transversus abdominis lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.

=== Deltoid ===
The anterior portion of the deltoid muscle is one of the major shoulder-joint horizontal adductors, moving the upper arms toward the chest during the upward phase of a push-up. It also helps control the speed of movement during the downward phase. The deltoid attaches to parts of the clavicle and scapula, just above the shoulder joint on one end, and to the outside of the humerus bone on the other. Along with horizontal adduction, the anterior deltoid assists with flexion and internal rotation of the humerus within the shoulder socket.

=== Chest muscles ===
The push-up requires the work of many muscle groups, with one of the primary muscle groups being the chest muscles, the pectoralis major and the minor. These are the two large chest muscles and the main pushing muscle group of the upper body. When pushing and lowering the body during a push-up, the pectoralis major is doing most of the work. As a result, these muscles become very strong and can become defined as lean muscle after doing push-ups regularly.

=== Stabilizers: back body ===
The push-up depends on stabilizer muscles as the body is pushed and lowered. The erector spinae is the main stabilizer muscle in the back. Made up of three muscles including the spinal, longissimus, and iliocostalis. The spinal runs adjacent to the spine, the longissimus runs adjacent to the spinal and the iliocostalis runs adjacent to the longissimus and over the ribs. Two muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus stabilize the upper leg. The medius and minimus sit under the largest butt muscle, the gluteus maximus.

=== Triceps brachii ===
While the anterior deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward phase of a push-up, the triceps brachii muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle is divided into three heads â the lateral head, long head, and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach to the back of the humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other.

=== Forearms ===
Stabilizers include wrist and forearm muscles, the knee extensors, and the hip/spine flexors, which all work isometrically to maintain a proper plank position in the standard prone push-up.

=== Biceps ===
During the push-up exercise, the short head of the biceps brachii muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer. This means the muscle activates at both endsâthe elbow and the shoulderâto help stabilize the joints.

=== Joints and tendons ===
Inner muscles that support the operation of the fingers, wrists, forearms, and elbows are also worked isometrically. Some push-up modifications that require to have the arms at different heights effectively engage the rotator cuff.

==Variations==
In the &quot;full push-up&quot;, the back and legs are straight and off the floor. There are several variations besides the common push-up. These include bringing the thumbs and index fingers of both hands together (a &quot;diamond push-up&quot;) as well as having the elbows pointed towards the knees. These variations are intended to put greater emphasis on the triceps or shoulders, rather than the chest muscles. When both hands are unbalanced or on uneven surfaces, this exercise works the body core. Raising the feet or hands onto elevated surfaces during the exercise emphasizes the upper (minor) or lower (major) pectorals, respectively. Raising the hands with the aid of push-up bars or a dumbbell allows for a greater range of motion, providing further stress for the muscles.

===Weighted push-ups===
Progressively overloading classic push-ups using barbell plates, resistance bands or any form of weight. The load is usually positioned on the upper back. This very effective exercise is not commonly performed because of the difficulty of loading the human body in that position. An alternate way to add weight to the push-up is by placing the hands on high handles bars and then elevating the feet on a high surface to get into a suspended push-up position. Due to the distance between the pelvis and the floor a dipping belt can be used to add weights from the pelvis. This method of adding extra weight to the push-up becomes more efficient.

===Knee push-ups===
&quot;Modified&quot; or &quot;knee&quot; push-ups are performed by supporting the lower body on the knees instead of the toes, which reduces the difficulty. These are sometimes used in fitness tests for women, corresponding to regular push-ups for men. This is useful for warm-ups/downs, pyramids/drop sets, endurance training, and rehab. It can also be used to train in a more explosive plyometric manner (like clapping push-ups) when one cannot perform them with the feet. It can also be used with the one-arm variations as a transition. However, the intense pressure on the knees can be harmful.

===Planche push-ups===

An extremely difficult variation is to perform a push-up using only hands, without resting the feet on the floor, i.e., starting from and returning to the planche position. These are known as &quot;planche push-ups&quot;. To do this variation, the body&#x27;s center of gravity must be kept over the hands while performing the push-up by leaning forward while the legs are elevated in the air, which requires great strength and a high level of balance. The entire body weight is lifted in this variation.

===Tandem push-ups===

Tandem push-ups are a variation of traditional push-ups, performed by two people working together. Each person is facing a different direction but with one of the athletes lying faced downwards on top of the other. It is considered a very challenging variation of the regular push-up because it requires two people to co-ordinate with perfect balance placing their feet to each others shoulders and pressing up.

=== Tandem knuckle push-ups ===
Tandem knuckle push-ups are a more challenging variation of push-ups performed by two people together, using their knuckles instead of their palms. They offer a greater challenge compared to tandem push-ups.

=== Hand release push-ups===
Hand release push-ups are a much more challenging variation of traditional push-ups, involving lifting the hands off the floor between each repetition.This way the athlete is forced to do a full and complete repetition. Lifting the hands off the ground completely resets the movement eliminating the momentum. This variation builds core and shoulder strength in addition to the benefits of the regular push-up.

=== Push-ups on medicine balls===
Push-ups on medicine balls are a variation of push-ups that involve performing the exercise on top of three medicine balls instead of on the floor. This modification adds an element of instability and core engagement to the exercise, making it more challenging and effective for building upper body strength and stability. More difficult variations include push-ups on medicine balls with one leg raised and decline push-ups on medicine balls.

===Knuckle push-ups===
Another variation is to perform push-ups on the knuckles of the fist, rather than with palms of the hands on the floor. This method is also commonly used in martial arts, such as Karate and Tae Kwon Do, and may be used in boxing training while wearing boxing gloves.

The intent, in addition to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the amount of strain in the wrist, compared to the typical &quot;palms on floor&quot; approach, and so it is sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors.

===Maltese push-up===
The &quot;Maltese push-up&quot; is a gymnastic variation of the push-up, in which the hands are positioned further down towards the hips (as opposed to roughly alongside the pectorals), but with a wide distance between them.

===Hindu push-up===
The most basic form of &quot;Hindu push-up&quot; starts from the downward dog yoga position (hands and feet on the floor with the posterior raised) and transitions to an upward dog position (hands and feet on the floor with the torso arched forwards and the legs close to the floor). It is also known as a &quot;dand&quot;, and is still widely known by this title especially in India where it originated from. It is a common exercise in Indian physical culture and martial arts, particularly Pehlwani. The famous martial artist Bruce Lee also used it in his training regime and referred to it as a &quot;cat stretch&quot;, influenced by The Great Gama. It is an effective core strength exercise because it dynamically involves both the anterior and posterior chains in a harmonious fashion. There are numerous variations of the Hindu push-up although most incorporate the two postures used in the most basic version. It may also be known as a &quot;Hanuman push up&quot;, &quot;judo push up&quot;, or &quot;dive-bomber push-up&quot;.

===Guillotine push-up===

The &quot;guillotine push-up&quot; is a form of push-up done from an elevated position (either hands-on elevated platforms or traditionally medicine balls) wherein the practitioner lowers the chest, head, and neck (thus the name) past the plane of the hands. The goal is to stretch the shoulders and put extra emphasis on the muscles there.

===Backhanded push-up===
The &quot;backhanded push-up&quot; is a form of push-ups performed using the back of the hands, rather than the palms. Currently, the record holder of the backhanded push-ups is Bill Kathan who broke the world record in 2010, by performing 2,396 on Valentine&#x27;s Day.

===One-arm versions===

Many of the push-up variations can be done using one arm instead of two. This will further increase the resistance put upon the trainee.

===Single-leg push-up===
To do single leg push-up lift one of the legs off the ground and do a set. Repeat the same with another leg.

===Narrow-grip push-up===
Do a normal push-up with the hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath the chest.

===Wide-grip push-up===
Similar to a normal push-up but with hands wider than shoulder width. This works the chest and shoulders more.

===Clap push-up===
At the peak of the push-up, push the body up off the ground and quickly clap the hands in midair. The fast jolting force of clap push-ups will help develop explosive power while also bulking up the pectoral muscles.

===Spider-Man push-up===
Do a normal push-up but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as the body rises. Switch knees with each rep. More stress can be added to the abs with a two-second hold.

=== Declined push-up ===
You can do a declined, or leg elevated, push-up by doing a normal push-up but with the feet on a bench or a step. Keep your back straight and low down instead of up during the exercise. The more your feet are elevated, the more difficult this variation will be. The declined push-up, with the downward angle, adds additional work to the front shoulder and upper pectoral muscles.

===Other versions===
There are some less difficult versions, which reduce the effort by supporting some of the bodyweights in some way. One can move on to the standard push-up after progress is made.

&quot;Wall&quot; push-ups are performed by standing close to a wall and pushing away from the wall with the arms; one can increase the difficulty by moving one&#x27;s feet further from the wall.

&quot;Table&quot; or &quot;chair&quot; push-ups are performed by pushing away from a table, chair, or other object. The lower the object, the more difficult the push-up. One should be sure that the object is securely stationary before attempting to push up from it.

&quot;Three-phase&quot; push-ups involve simply breaking a standard push-up into three components and doing each one slowly and deliberately. Participants usually start face down on the floor with hands outstretched either perpendicular or parallel to the body. The first phase involves the arms being brought palms down on a 90-degree angle at the elbows. The second phase involves the body being pushed into the up position. The third phase is returning to the starting position. This technique is commonly used after a large block of regular push-ups, as it poses less stress and requires less effort.

&quot;Diamond&quot; or &quot;Triceps&quot; push-ups are done by placing both palms on the ground and touching together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups because, at the bottom of the stroke, the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in a much higher mechanical load on the triceps. There is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond-shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand are placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond. This special diamond push-up is done by the United States Marine Corps. The lips must come within 1 inch of the floor while keeping the neck in line with the straight spine to qualify as a valid push-up. This can be verified by placing a 1-inch foam disposable earplug on the floor in the center of the diamond and picking it up with the lips.

&quot;Hollow-Body&quot; push-ups are performed in the position gymnasts call the &quot;hollow body&quot;. In the plank version of the hollow body, the shoulders are protracted into a pronounced curve in the upper back while the abdominal muscles are tightened and the legs are locked and squeezed together. This variation requires full-body tension to execute and results in greater integration of the hips, shoulders, and core.

===Plyometrics===
Two platforms are placed beside the trainee, one on either side. The exercise begins with the hands-on either platform supporting the body, then the subject drops to the ground and explosively rebounds with a push-up, extending the torso and arms completely off the ground and returning the hands to the platforms.

Another is simply an explosive push-up where a person attempts to push quickly and with enough force to raise his or her hands several centimeters off the ground, with the body completely suspended on the feet for a moment, a variation of the drop push. This is necessary for performing &#x27;clap push-ups&#x27; i.e. clapping the hands while in the air.

Aztec push-ups

The Aztec push-up is one of the most difficult plyometric push-ups. A person performs an Aztec push-up by beginning in the normal push-up starting position and exploding upward with both the hands and feet, driving the entire body into the air. While in the air, the body is bent at the waist and the hands quickly touch the toes. The body is then quickly straightened and the hands and feet break the fall, returning the body to the normal push-up position for another repetition.

360 push-ups

The 360 push-up is a variation of the superman push-up where one rotates 360 degrees while in the air.

Falling and explosive rebound push-ups
Here one falls to the ground from standing position and then using an explosive push-up gets back to standing position.

With push-ups, many possibilities for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand can be set on a higher platform than the other or be further away from the other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform push-ups by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, push-ups can be performed on one arm or using weights.

Push-ups between chairs form an integral part of the &quot;Dynamic Tension&quot; Course devised by Charles Atlas, and similar systems.

==Record breakers and attempts==
* The Guinness world record for most push-ups in one hour is 3,054 by Jarrad Young on 11 June 2021 in Queensland, Australia.
*The most push-ups in 24 hours is 46,001 and was achieved by Charles Servizio on 25 April 1993.
*The United States of America National Record for Fastest to 1,000 Pushups is 29 Minutes by JZ PUSHUPS on Wednesday, February 26, 2025. However, this workout was unsanctioned. The sanctioned workout for United States of America Fastest to 1,000 is Jeff Myers (29 Minutes 27 Seconds) from Birmingham, AL, on New Year&#x27;s Day, Friday January 1, 2016. Funny enough, JZ PUSHUPS, who does Inside of One Consecutive Hour Pushups Workouts Professionally, did a Victorious 1,601 Pushups Inside of One Consecutive Hour Pushups Workout In La Porte, IN (Chicagoland/Northwest Indiana). 7 Years Later, New Year&#x27;s Day, Sunday, January 1, 2023, The JZ Spring Break Pushups Championship Trophy was Born in Chicago.

==In the animal kingdom==
There are zoology observations that certain animals emulate a &quot;push up&quot; action. Most notably various taxa of the fence lizard exhibit this display, primarily involving the male engaging in postures to attract females. The western fence lizard is a particular species that also engage in this behavior. (It may be noted that in Mexican Spanish, push-ups are called &quot;Lagartijas&quot;, which means &quot;lizards&quot;.)

<text>The Winnipeg Art Gallery (WAG) is an art museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Its permanent collection includes over 24,000 works from Canadian, Indigenous Canadian, and international artists. The museum also holds the world&#x27;s largest collection of Inuit art. In addition to exhibits for its collection, the museum has organized and hosted a number of travelling arts exhibitions. Its building complex consists of a main building that includes of indoor space and the adjacent Qaumajuq building.

The present institution was formally incorporated in 1963, although it traces its origins to the Winnipeg Museum of Fine Arts, an art museum opened to the public in 1912 by the Winnipeg Development and Industrial Bureau. The bureau opened the Winnipeg School of Arts in the following year, and operated the art museum and art school until 1923, when the two entities were incorporated as the Winnipeg Gallery and School of Arts. In 1926, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formed to assist the institution in operating its museum component. The Winnipeg Gallery and School of Art was dissolved in 1950, although its collection was loaned indefinitely to the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association, who continued to exhibit it.

In 1963, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formally incorporated as the Winnipeg Art Gallery by the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. The museum moved to its present location in September 1971, with the opening of a purpose-built building designed by Gustavo da Roza. In 2021, the museum opened a Michael Maltzan-designed Qaumajuq building in order to house the museum&#x27;s Inuit art collection.

== History ==

===Background===

The city&#x27;s first serious art gallery was first opened in the former Manitoba Hotel (built by the Northern Pacific Railway), located at Main and Water Ave. An area of the hotel was set aside for an art studio. The art gallery was organized by Cora Moore, who upon return from a trip to Toronto, organized a Winnipeg branch of the Women&#x27;s Art Association of Canada and subsequently an artists group for men. The first art exhibit took place in February 1895. The art gallery featured art from artists from Manitoba, as well as Toronto, Montreal, New York, London, and Paris. The art gallery was shut down after the Manitoba Hotel burned down in 1899.

Efforts to create another art museum began in 1902, after the Manitoba Society of Artists was formed, and its members began to lobby for the creation of a provincial civic and arts institution. In addition to the Manitoba Society of Artists, the Winnipeg-branch of the Western Art Association adopted a mandate that promoted the creation of an art museum to art from Manitoba, and the rest of Canada in 1908.

====Gallery and school of art====
After the first phase of the Board of Trade building was completed in April 1912, the Winnipeg Development and Industrial Bureau unveiled plans for its second phase expansion of the building, which featured a space designated for an art museum. The art museum, named the Winnipeg Museum of Fine Arts, was formally opened by the Mayor of Winnipeg Richard Deans Waugh, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba Douglas Cameron, and the president of the Winnipeg Development and Industrial Bureau on 16 December 1912. The first exhibition held at the museum featured 275 works from the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

Building upon the success of the art museum, the bureau opened the Winnipeg School of Arts in the same building on 21 June 1913. The art school, and museum operated as separate departments of the same institution, initially controlled by the bureau. The institution became independent of the bureau in April 1923, when it was formally incorporated as the Winnipeg Gallery and School of Art by the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

However, by the mid 1920s, the institution faced financial difficulties, and was forced to suspend most museum operations in 1926, with its remaining expenses for the museum being paid towards insurance, campaigns to increase membership, and sundry repairs. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection was held by the School of Art in trust while the museum was closed. In August 1926, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formed to assist the museum in its operations. The gallery resumed normal operations on 22 April 1932, when it was reopened at the Civic Auditorium&#x27;s (the present Manitoba Archives Building) western wing. The School of Art remained in the Board of Trade building until its demolition in 1935, and was relocated twice, in 1936, and 1938.

In June 1950, the Winnipeg Gallery and the School of Art was formally dissolved, with the School of Art being incorporated into the University of Manitoba. Works collected for the former institution&#x27;s permanent collection were loaned to the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association for an &quot;indefinite&quot; period, who continued to exhibit the collection at the Civic Auditorium.

===Winnipeg Art Gallery (1963âpresent)===
On 6 May 1963, the Winnipeg Art Gallery Association was formally incorporated as the Winnipeg Art Gallery by the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. In 1965, discussions were raised to move the art gallery from the Civic Auditorium, although the institution opposed a proposed move to the Manitoba Centennial Centre, along with the Centennial Concert Hall, and the Manitoba Museum. The Winnipeg Art Gallery criticized the proposal stating that &quot;the politicians of the city have set various arts groups on each other, and the result has been many objections. We of the Arts Gallery are sitting tight â but we are not sitting still.&quot;

In 1967, the museum acquired a triangular plot of land across from the Civic Auditorium and launched a competition for architects to submit designs for a new building. The proposed design required the demolition of several buildings on the proposed site, including an unused service station, and the Cinema Centre building. Work on a new museum building began in 1969.

The gallery moved to its present location in 1971, into a building designed by Canadian architect Gustavo Da Roza. Along with expanding the exhibition spaces, the new building also allowed for the museum&#x27;s storage conservation unit to be housed in the same building, as opposed to an off-site location. Construction for the building cost approximately C$4.5 million, with the funding coming from the federal and provincial governments, private donations, as well as a public campaign to raise funds. The building was officially opened to the public on 25 September 1971 by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.

In October 1995, the museum expanded its property by acquiring the former Medical Mall building adjacent to its building and used it to house the museum&#x27;s art studio programs.

In 2012, the museum, and the National Gallery of Canada entered into a three-year agreement to exhibit works from the National Gallery&#x27;s collection at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. In November 2015, the Government of Nunavut reached a five-year loan agreement with the Government of Manitoba, to exhibit the Government of Nunavut&#x27;s collection of 8,000 works at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. The Government of Nunavut collection formed in 1999, and was originally housed in the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yellowknife. The Government of Nunavut originally planned to house the collection in a climate-controlled facility in Iqaluit, although those plans were later abandoned.

In June 2016, the museum opened a retail space, known as WAG@The Forks, in an effort to promote and sell Inuit art at The Forks. The retail space was the result of a partnership formed between the Government of Nunavut, and the Winnipeg Art Gallery. In September 2016, the museum, and the Assiniboine Park Conservancy opened WAG@ThePark at the Assiniboine Park Pavilion. WAG@ThePark was opened as a partnership between the Winnipeg Art Gallery and the Assiniboine Park Conservancy, which saw the museum curate exhibitions in the building. Most of the works from the exhibitions at WAG@ThePark is from the Conservancy&#x27;s collection, although some Inuit works from the museum&#x27;s permanent collection were also exhibited at the pavilion.

In 2018, a lost painting by Alfred Munnings was located in the permanent collections of the Winnipeg Art Gallery. The painting depicts Brigadier General R.W. Paterson&#x27;s horse, Peggy, during the First World War, and was lost shortly after a Royal Academy of Arts exhibition in 1919, which featured that piece, and 43 other works from Munnings. The lost painting was identified in the Winnipeg Art Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection after a public appeal to locate the work was issued by the British National Army Museum; in their efforts to recreate the 1919 exhibition. According to the Winnipeg Art Gallery, the painting entered its collection in 1984, donated to them by Paterson&#x27;s children.

The former Medical Mall building was demolished in 2017 in order to accommodate the construction of a new building to house the museum&#x27;s collection of Inuit art, known as Qaumajuq, which broke ground in May 2018. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new building was held in May 2018, and featured the lighting of a qulliq, an Inuit drum dance, and throat singing. Cost for the construction of Qaumajuq is estimated to be C$65 million, with C$35 million obtained from the federal, provincial, and municipal government, and the remaining funds covered by public and private donors. The centre would be the first museum building in the world dedicated to Inuit art upon its opening. 
Qaumajuq was opened to the public on 25 March 2021.

In 2023, the museum began the process to remove the name of former director, Ferdinand Eckhardt, from its entrance hall, after reports emerged of his Nazi-linked activities in occupied Europe.

==Grounds==
The main property the Winnipeg Art Gallery presently occupies was acquired in 1967. The museum&#x27;s main building was opened on the property on 25 September 1971. In 1995, the property was expanded after the museum acquired the former Medical Mall south of the main building. In 2017, the former Medical Mall was demolished to make way for Qaumajuq, a building centred around Inuit art. The main building and Qaumajuq will be connected by a skyway between the two buildings.

===Main building===

The main building for the Winnipeg Art Gallery was opened in September 1971 and was designed by Gustavo da Roza in a late-modernist style. During the design and construction process, da Roza partnered with Number Ten Architects, who provided architectural drafting and project management.

The building&#x27;s exterior was designed as an iceberg-shaped &quot;triangular mass,&quot; with an austere low silhouette, and almost no windows throughout its exterior. The building&#x27;s exterior walls are sloped to reflect sunlight, and uses &quot;aggressive&quot; geometric angles. A wedge that protrudes from the &quot;main mass&quot; forms the entrance to the main building. Most of the building was built from poured-in-place, reinforced concrete and clad in Tyndall stone. According to da Roza, the use of Tyndall stone for the load-bearing wall was selected to help affirm the &quot;character of [the] northern prairie environment.&quot; Tyndall stone is also used extensively for the walls and floor of the interior, and the lounges in the building&#x27;s second floor.

The interior of the gallery was designed to help maintain and preserve works exhibited in the building and includes mechanical systems that maintain the atmosphere of the building at an appropriate temperature and humidity for the works. As a result of the building&#x27;s angular shape, nearly every room in the building has a different shape from the other rooms in the building. The interior of the building features of exhibition space. Most of the building&#x27;s viewing galleries are located on the third floor, which also features a skylight set from the building&#x27;s rooftop garden; whereas the mezzanine level is dedicated to smaller exhibition spaces, the museum&#x27;s library, and offices.

The ground level, known as Ferdinand Eckhardt Hall, is a large space sheathed in saw-cut Tyndall stone and houses the museum&#x27;s gift shop and art rental store, conservation lab, the main lobby, and a 320-seat auditorium complete this level. The museum&#x27;s restaurant facilities and access to the rooftop garden are located on the building&#x27;s fourth floor, while its storage for its collections are located in the building&#x27;s basement. The total indoor area of the building is .

=== Qaumajuq ===

The museum property is also home to Qaumajuq, a four-storey building, situated to the south of the main building at Memorial Boulevard and St. Mary Avenue. Michael Maltzan, the principal architect for Michael Maltzan Architecture, was contracted to design the building in 2012. PCL Construction was contracted to construct the building. Construction for the building began in late MayÂ 2018, after the former building that occupied the site, the Medical Mall, was demolished in 2017. The building opened in March 2021.

The design of Qaumajuq was intended to both complement the existing main building, as well as reflect where most of the works intended to be housed in the building originated from. The building&#x27;s exterior is clad in glass and off-white stone, although concrete and steel were also used as building materials. The building will feature 22 recessed skylights approximately above the floor. The skylights are designed to emit light on its exterior side, glowing &quot;like a lantern&quot;.

A curved design is used throughout the interior, as a reflection of Northern Canada&#x27;s &quot;openness&quot;. The building&#x27;s atrium features a serpentine steel frame of the building&#x27;s three-storey visible storage for works for items in the Inuit collection not on exhibit. The visible storage is adjacent to the building&#x27;s entrance on the corner of St. Mary&#x27;s Avenue and Memorial Boulevard, with a lecture room, cafÃ©, and reading room adjacent to the building&#x27;s atrium. The building&#x27;s second level includes a 90-seat theatre, a library, and a learning commons on the second floor. Most of the museum&#x27;s exhibition space is located on the building&#x27;s third floor, which has approximately of exhibition space. Five indoor, and two outdoor art studios are situated on the buildings&#x27; uppermost level. The upper roof level of the building is also designed to provide space for exhibitions, public performances.

== Permanent collection ==
As of March 2015, the Winnipeg Art Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection includes over 24,000 works from Canadian and international artists. Approximately 70 percent of the permanent collection was gifted to the museum by private donors. &quot;Summer Afternoon, the Prairie&quot; by Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald was the first work purchased by the museum for its permanent collection.

The collection is organized into several collection areas, Canadian art, decorative arts, Inuit art, international art, photography, and works on paper. The photography collection was made a specialized area of its permanent collection during the 1980s. Its photography collection includes 1,400 works, most of which originated from Canadian artists in the latter half of the 20th century. The museum&#x27;s works on paper collection contains approximately 6,000 items in its collection, encompassing historical to contemporary works by international artists, and Canadian artists, whose works make up the majority of the works on prints collection.

===Canadian art===
The museum&#x27;s Canadian collection includes works from Canadian artists dating back to the 1820s to the present day. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection includes 200 works by Canadian artists from 1820 to 1910. Work by Canadian artists prior to the 20th century in the museum&#x27;s collection include those created by Maurice Cullen, Mary Riter Hamilton, John A. Hammond, Robert Harris, Otto Reinhold Jacobi, Paul Kane, Cornelius Krieghoff, James Wilson Morrice, Lucius Richard O&#x27;Brien, William Raphael, George Agnew Reid, Peter Rindisbacher, Frederick Arthur Verner, and Homer Watson.

The collection also features a sizable collection of Canadian modern art (works produced from 1910 to 1979) including works by artists of the Winnipeg Gallery and School of Art, Painters Eleven, and the Regina Five. The museum&#x27;s Canadian modern art collection also includes several works from the Group of Seven, including over 1,000 works from Group of Seven member Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald. Other works in the collection by modern Canadian artists include Bertram Brooker, Emily Carr, Charles Comfort, Ivan Eyre, Prudence Heward, William Kurelek, David Milne, Walter J. Phillips, Tony Tascona and William H. Lobchuk and other printmakers of the Grand Western Canadian Screen Shop.

The museum&#x27;s also has a collection contemporary art from Canadian artists, most of which is made up equally of prints and paintings, although it also includes collages, drawings, installations, sculptures, and videos. The museum&#x27;s collection of contemporary Canadian art includes works by Eleanor Bond, Aganetha Dyck, Cliff Eyland, Wanda Koop, Janet Werner, and the Royal Art Lodge.

===Decorative art===
As of March 2015, the museum&#x27;s decorative art collection includes more than 4,000 works of ceramic, glass, metal, and textiles from the 17th century to the present. The decorative arts collection began in the 1950s when the museum was bequeathed a collection of decorative works from Melanie Bolton-Hill. The collection includes 1,500 ceramics from British artisans in the 18th and 19th centuries; nearly 1,000 Art Nouveau and Art Deco-styled glass objects from the late 19th century to the early 20th century; and 500 works of silver from British and Canadian silversmiths.

===International art===
The museum&#x27;s international art collection is made up of paintings from American and European artists from the 19th and 20th centuries. The museum&#x27;s international collection includes the Gort Collection, which features 19 panel paintings, and 5 tapestries from Northern Renaissance artists in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Gort Collection was bequeathed to the museum in 1973, although before that, it was already on long-term loan to the institution since 1954. The museum&#x27;s international art collection also includes works by Alexander Archipenko, EugÃ¨ne Boudin, Marc Chagall, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Raoul Dufy, Henri Fantin-Latour, Dan Flavin, Sol LeWitt, and Henry Moore.

===Inuit art===

The Winnipeg Art Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection also includes the world&#x27;s largest collection of Inuit art, numbering over 13,000 works in March 2019. Inuit carvings make up nearly two-thirds of the museum&#x27;s Inuit collection, which includes 7,500 antler, bone, ivory, and stone carvings, dozens of hand-sewn wall hangings. Other works in the collection includes 3,000 prints and drawings from Inuit artists.

The first works for the museum&#x27;s Inuit collection were acquired in the 1950s, although the museum&#x27;s first substantial acquisition of Inuit works came in 1960, when George Swinton donated 130 sculptures to the museum. The collection was further bolstered in 1971, when the Jerry Twomey Collection, featuring 4,000 Inuit works, was donated to the museum. In 1989, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (later renamed Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) donated 1,400 prints and drawings from Inuit artists to the museum.

Since 1972, the museum has appointed a full-time curator to oversee its collection of Inuit art. Most of the works from the museum&#x27;s Inuit collection was stored in the basement storage space of its main building, although the museum planned to move these pieces to Qaumajuq&#x27;s visible storage vault and exhibit. Qaumajuq was opened to the public in 2021.

Quamajuq&#x27;s inaugural exhibit was named INUA, meaning &quot;life force&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; in some Arctic dialects. INUA is also an acronym for &quot;Inuit Nunangat Ungammuaktut Atautikkut&quot; (Inuit Moving Forward Together). The lead curator of the all-Inuit curatorial team designing the exhibit was Heather Igloliorte. Each of the four curators represented an area of the north. Igloliorte comes from Nunatsiavut, Krista Ulujuk Zawadski from Nunavut, Asinnajaq from Nunavik, and Kablusiak is Inuvialuit. A focus in creating the exhibit was to honour ancestors and families and to connect people living today to &quot;that trajectory of who our ancestors are and who we will become ancestors for&quot;.

==Library and archives==
The museum also operates a library and archives, maintained by its curatorial department. Known as the Clara Lander Library, its holdings include books, and records that assists in the museum&#x27;s educational mandate; whereas its archives contain administrative, curatorial, and educational documents relating to the museum. Access to the Clara Lander Library is free of charge, although a written request must be submitted to the museum to access its materials.

<doc id="712697" wikidata="Q448698" url="?curid=712697" title="Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis">
<text>Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder characterized by an abnormal accumulation of surfactant-derived lipoprotein compounds within the alveoli of the lung. The accumulated substances interfere with the normal gas exchange and expansion of the lungs, ultimately leading to difficulty breathing and a predisposition to developing lung infections. The causes of PAP may be grouped into primary (autoimmune PAP, hereditary PAP), secondary (multiple diseases), and congenital (multiple diseases, usually genetic) causes, although the most common cause is a primary autoimmune condition in an individual. 

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of PAP include shortness of breath, cough, low grade fever, and weight loss. Additionally, the clinical course of PAP is unpredictable. Spontaneous remission is recognized, and some patients have stable symptoms. Notably, some individuals with PAP may remain asymptomatic, with the condition only being detected incidentally during medical evaluations. Death may occur due to the progression of PAP or of any underlying associated disease. Individuals with PAP are more vulnerable to lung infections such as nocardiosis, &quot;Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare&quot; infection, or fungal infections.

==Causes==
The abnormal accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds in PAP is due to impaired surfactant regulation and clearance. This is usually related to impaired alveolar macrophage function. In adults, the most common cause of PAP is an autoimmunity to granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a critical factor in development of alveolar macrophages. Decreased bioavailability of GM-CSF results in poor alveolar macrophages development and function, which results in accumulation of surfactant and related products.

Secondary causes of PAP are those in which the accumulation of lipoproteinaceous compounds is secondary to another disease process. This has been recognized in the settings of certain cancers (such as myeloid leukemia), lung infections, or environmental exposure to dusts or chemicals, such as nickel.

Although the cause of PAP was not originally understood, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the cause of the disease came by the chance observation that mice bred for experimental study to lack a hematologic growth factor known as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) developed a pulmonary syndrome of abnormal surfactant accumulation resembling human PAP.

The implications of this finding are still being explored, but significant progress was reported in February 2007. Researchers in that report discussed the presence of anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies in patients with PAP, and duplicated that syndrome with the infusion of these autoantibodies into mice.

Familial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental &quot;GATA2&quot; genes produces an autosomal dominant disorder termed GATA2 deficiency. The &quot;GATA2&quot; gene produces the GATA2 transcription factor which is critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lympathic-forming, and other tissue-forming cells. Individuals with a single &quot;GATA2&quot; inactivating mutation present with a wide range of disorders including pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. &quot;GATA2&quot; mutation-based pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with normal levels of GM-CSF and commonly improves or is avoided in afflicted individuals who successfully receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

==Genetics==

Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a recessive genetic condition in which individuals are born with genetic mutations that deteriorate the function of the CSF2 receptor alpha on alveolar macrophages. Consequently, a messenger molecule known as granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is unable to stimulate alveolar macrophages to clear surfactant, leading to difficulty with breathing. The gene for the CSF2 receptor alpha is located in the 5q31 region of chromosome 5, and the gene product can also be referred to as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of PAP is made using a combination of a person&#x27;s symptoms, chest imaging, and microscopic evaluation of lung washing/tissue. Additional testing for serum anti-GM-CSF antibodies are helpful for confirmation.

Although both the symptoms and imaging findings are stereotypical and well-described, they are non-specific and indistinguishable from many other conditions. For example, chest x-ray may show alveolar opacities, and a CT may show a crazy paving lung pattern, both of which are seen more commonly in numerous other conditions. Thus, the diagnosis primarily depends on the pathology findings.

Lung washings or tissue for histopathologic analysis are most commonly obtained using bronchoalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy. Characteristic biopsy findings show filling of the alveoli (and sometimes terminal bronchioles) with an amorphous eosinophilic material, which stains strongly positive on PAS stain and the PAS diastase stain. The surrounding alveoli and pulmonary interstitium remain relatively normal. Electron microscopy of the sample, although not typically performed due to impracticality, shows lamellated bodies representing surfactant. An alternative diagnosis with similar histomorphologic findings is &quot;Pneumocystis jirovicii&quot; pneumonia.

Lung washings characteristically yield a fluid which is &quot;milky&quot;composition. Under the microscope, samples show 20-50 micrometer PAS-positive globules on a background of finely granular or amorphous PAS-positive material. There is typically a low numbers of macrophages and inflammatory cells (although this is variable).

==Treatment==
The standard treatment for PAP is whole-lung lavage and supportive care. Whole lung lavage is a procedure performed under general anesthesia, in which one lung is pumped with oxygen (ventilated lung), and the other lung (non-ventilated lung) is filled with a warm saline solution (up to 20 L) and drained, removing any proteinaceous effluent along with it. This is generally effective at improving PAP symptoms, often for a prolonged period of time. Other treatments still being studied include subcutaneous and inhaled GM-CSF, and rituximab, an intravenous infusion that works to stop the production of the autoantibodies responsible for autoimmune PAP. Lung transplantation has been performed in individuals with the various forms of PAP; however, this is often only used when all other treatment options have failed and significant lung damage has developed due to the risks, complications, or recurrence of PAP following transplantation. As of 2022, methionine oral supplementation has been tested on patients with methionine tRNA synthetase-related PAP and has strong evidence of its efficacy on these patients. 

==Epidemiology==
The disease is more common in males and in tobacco smokers.

In a recent epidemiologic study from Japan, Autoimmune PAP has an incidence and prevalence higher than previously reported and is not strongly linked to smoking, occupational exposure, or other illnesses. Endogenous lipoid pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis has been seen prior to the development of PAP in a child.

==History==
PAP was first described in 1958 by the physicians Samuel Rosen, Benjamin Castleman, and Averill Liebow. In their case series published in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; on June 7 of that year, they described 27 patients with pathologic evidence of periodic acid Schiff positive material filling the alveoli. This lipid rich material was subsequently recognized to be surfactant.

The reported treatment of PAP using therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage was in 1960 by Dr. Jose Ramirez-Rivera at the Veterans&#x27; Administration Hospital in Baltimore, who described repeated &quot;segmental flooding&quot; as a means of physically removing the accumulated alveolar material.

==Research==
PAP is one of the rare lung diseases currently being studied by the Rare Lung Diseases Consortium. The consortium is part of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, an initiative of the Office of Rare Diseases Research, of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and dedicated to developing new diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with rare lung diseases, through collaboration between the National Institutes of Health, patient organizations and clinical investigators.

<doc id="712713" wikidata="Q856662" url="?curid=712713" title="Lautoka">
<text>Lautoka (; ) is the third largest metropolitan area in Fiji. It is on the west coast of the island of Viti Levu, in the Ba Province of the Western Division. Lying in the heart of Fiji&#x27;s sugar cane-growing region, the city has come to be known as the &quot;Sugar City&quot;. Covering an area of 32 square kilometres, it had a population of 71,573 at the 2017 census, the most recent to date.

==Economic activities==
Lautoka is known as the &quot;Sugar City&quot; because of its sugar cane belt areas. The main Lautoka Sugar Mill was founded in 1903, and is the city&#x27;s biggest employer by far. Built for the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji) (CSR) by workers from India and the Solomon Islands between 1899 and 1903, it hires some 1,300 employees today. Other industries include timber milling, garment manufacturing, distillery, brewery, jewellery, blending, steelworks, fishing, hatchery, domestic items, paints, and construction.

==History==
The name of the city is derived from two Fijian words meaning &quot;spear hit.&quot; According to an oral tradition, the name arose following a duel between two chiefs. As one speared the other, he was reported to have cried &quot;Lau-toka!&quot; (&quot;Bull&#x27;s eye!&quot;).

The first known European sighting of the Lautoka area took place on 7 May 1789. Captain William Bligh spotted and roughly charted the coasts of Lautoka while making his epic voyage to Timor, in the wake of the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;.

This city is central to sugar cane production in Fiji, and was populated by large numbers of indentured labourers working on the sugar cane plantations from the late 19th century onwards, many having come from India. In some respects, the city maintains a unique cultural identity in Fiji to this day, with a proud musical tradition linked to the early development of jazz. 

During World War II, the US Navy built a base at Lautoka as part of Naval Base Fiji.

In 2012, Lautoka was announced as the administration capital of the western division.

==Politics==
Incorporated as a town in 1929, Lautoka was proclaimed a city on 25 February 1977. It is governed by a 16-member city council, who elect from among themselves a mayor. Lautoka currently does not have a mayor but has a government-appointed administrator like all urban centres in Fiji since the military coup of 2006. The former administrator was Parveen Bala, who was also mayor of Ba.

A well-known past Mayor is Ratilal Patel, who was elected mayor in 1967.

Lautoka is the only city in Fiji&#x27;s Western Division, and is the industrial hub of Fiji which contains more than 50 percent of the nation&#x27;s population. It is also the headquarters of the Fiji Electricity Authority, the Fiji Pine Ltd, and the National Marketing Authority.

==Mass media==
The headquarters and studios of Mix FM Fiji are located in Lautoka. MixFM is the only national English radio station in Fiji to be based outside of Suva.

==Demographics==
Since 1970, the population of Lautoka has grown rapidly, and in the last twenty years it has also changed dramatically in structure. In the early 1970s, the population was estimated to be about 12,000, the vast majority of inhabitants being Indian, as would be expected considering the early growth of the city was entirely associated with the sugar industry. Almost all of the present Indian inhabitants are descendants of the early girmityas. In 1986 the population was 39,000 and in 1996 almost 43,000, but it is not clear exactly how the boundaries of the urban area were defined at either of these censuses. In 2005 the population including the suburban zones was probably about 50,000, occupying a total area of about 16Â km2. The population of Lautoka including the rural districts is around 80,000. But much of the recent growth of the city itself has been due to indigenous Fijians moving into the urban area.

The city is the birthplace of PGA Tour Hall of Famer Vijay Singh and Ghazal and Tabla star Cassius Khan.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the city recorded the first cases of the virus in the country, causing the immediate lockdown of the city in March 2020. The lockdown lasted 18 days, with only essential services allowed to operate and no one allowed to enter or exit the confined area.

In April 2021, the city was yet again the epicentre of another community outbreak and a second lockdown was issued. The lockdown is expected to last one to two months.

== Transport ==
Port of Lautoka is the main maritime gateway for western Viti Levu and is the second largest port in Fiji. The port is mainly used for bulk sugar, molasses, woodchips, petroleum and gas. The port is also used for cruises, including Blue Lagoon Cruises and Nai&#x27;s Cruises. 

Lautoka is served by Pacific Transport and Sunbeam buses. Pacific Transport connects Lautoka directly to Nadi Intl Airport and Ba. Sunbeam runs 8 times daily Queen&#x27;s Highway Service, linking Lautoka to Suva with stops at Nadi International Airport, Nadi Town, Fijian (Shangri â La) Resort, Sigatoka Town, Abua Sands, Hideaway Resort, Naviti Resort, Korolevu, Warwick Resorts, Beach House, Crusoes Retreat Junction, Deuba Inn and Tradewinds Lami.

Ferry Service by Patterson Brothers Shipping Company connects Lautoka to Labasa, Savusavu and Nabouwalu (Vanua Levu).

<text>The Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA; ) was a nuclear thermal rocket engine development program that ran for roughly two decades. Its principal objective was to &quot;establish a technology base for nuclear rocket engine systems to be utilized in the design and development of propulsion systems for space mission application&quot;. It was a joint effort of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and was managed by the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) until the program ended in January 1973. SNPO was led by NASA&#x27;s Harold Finger and AEC&#x27;s Milton Klein.

NERVA had its origins in Project Rover, an AEC research project at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) with the initial aim of providing a nuclear-powered upper stage for the United States Air Force intercontinental ballistic missiles. Nuclear thermal rocket engines promised to be more efficient than chemical ones. After the formation of NASA in 1958, Project Rover was continued as a civilian project and was reoriented to producing a nuclear powered upper stage for NASA&#x27;s Saturn V Moon rocket. Reactors were tested at very low power before being shipped to Jackass Flats in the Nevada Test Site. While LASL concentrated on reactor development, NASA built and tested complete rocket engines.

The AEC, SNPO, and NASA considered NERVA a highly successful program in that it met or exceeded its program goals. It demonstrated that nuclear thermal rocket engines were a feasible and reliable tool for space exploration, and at the end of 1968 SNPO deemed that the latest NERVA engine, the XE, met the requirements for a human mission to Mars. The program had strong political support from Senators Clinton P. Anderson and Margaret Chase Smith but was cancelled by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Although NERVA engines were built and tested as much as possible with flight-certified components and the engine was deemed ready for integration into a spacecraft, they never flew in space.

== Origins ==
During World War II, some scientists at the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory where the first atomic bombs were designed, including Stan Ulam, Frederick Reines and Frederic de Hoffmann, speculated about the development of nuclear-powered rockets. In 1946, Ulam and C. J. Everett wrote a paper in which they considered the use of atomic bombs as a means of rocket propulsion. This would become the basis for Project Orion.

The public revelation of atomic energy at the end of the war generated a great deal of speculation, and in the United Kingdom, Val Cleaver, the chief engineer of the rocket division at De Havilland, and Leslie Shepherd, a nuclear physicist at the University of Cambridge, independently considered the problem of nuclear rocket propulsion. They became collaborators, and in a series of papers published in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in 1948 and 1949, they outlined the design of a nuclear-powered rocket with a solid-core graphite heat exchanger. They reluctantly concluded that although nuclear thermal rockets were essential for deep space exploration, they were not yet technically feasible.

In 1953, Robert W. Bussard, a physicist working on the Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft (NEPA) project at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory wrote a detailed study on &quot;Nuclear Energy for Rocket Propulsion&quot;. He had read Cleaver and Shepard&#x27;s work, that of the Chinese physicist Hsue-Shen Tsien, and a February 1952 report by engineers at  Consolidated Vultee. Bussard&#x27;s study had little impact at first because only 29 copies were printed, and it was classified as Restricted Data, and therefore could only be read by someone with the required security clearance. In December 1953, it was published in Oak Ridge&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Reactor Science and Technology&quot;. The paper was still classified, as was the journal, but this gave it a wider circulation. Darol Froman, the deputy director of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), and Herbert York, the director of the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore, were interested and established committees to investigate nuclear rocket propulsion. Froman brought Bussard out to LASL to assist for one week per month.

Bussard&#x27;s study also attracted the attention of John von Neumann, who formed an ad hoc committee for nuclear propulsion of missiles. Mark Mills, the assistant director at Livermore was its chairman, and its other members were Norris Bradbury from LASL; Edward Teller and Herbert York from Livermore; Abe Silverstein, the associate director of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, a federal agency that conducted aeronautical research; and Allen F. Donovan from Ramo-Wooldridge, an aerospace corporation. After hearing input on several designs, the Mills committee recommended in March 1955 that development proceed, with the aim of producing a nuclear rocket upper stage for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). York created a new division at Livermore, and Bradbury created a new one called N Division at LASL under the leadership of Raemer Schreiber, to pursue it. In March 1956, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), the agency responsible for the management of the national nuclear weapons stockpile, recommended allocating $100 million to the nuclear rocket engine project over three years for the two laboratories to conduct feasibility studies and the construction of test facilities. 

Eger V. Murphree and Herbert Loper at the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) were more cautious. The Atlas missile program was proceeding well, and if successful would have sufficient range to hit targets in most of the Soviet Union. At the same time, nuclear warheads were becoming smaller, lighter and more powerful. The case for a new technology that promised heavier payloads over longer distances therefore seemed weak. However, the nuclear rocket had acquired a political patron in Senator Clinton P. Anderson from New Mexico (where LASL was located). The deputy chairman of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE), Anderson was close to von Neumann, Bradbury and Ulam. He managed to secure funding in January 1957.

All work on the nuclear rocket was consolidated at LASL, where it was given the codename Project Rover; Livermore was assigned responsibility for the development of the nuclear ramjet, which was codenamed Project Pluto. Project Rover was directed by an active duty United States Air Force (USAF) officer seconded to the AEC, Lieutenant Colonel Harold R. Schmidt. He was answerable to another seconded USAF officer, Colonel Jack L. Armstrong, who was also in charge of Pluto and the Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power (SNAP) projects.

===Underlying concepts===
Rocket engines create thrust by accelerating a working mass in a direction opposite to their desired trajectory. In conventional designs, this is accomplished by heating a fluid and allowing it to escape through a rocket nozzle. The energy needed to produce the heat is provided by a chemical reaction in the fuel, which may be mixed together as in the case of most solid fuel rockets, or separate tanks as in most liquid fuel rockets. Selecting the fuels to use is a complex task that has to consider the reaction energy, the mass of the fuel, the mass of the resulting working fluid, and other practical concerns like density and its ability to be easily pumped.

Nuclear rocket engines use a nuclear reactor to provide the energy to heat the fuel instead of a chemical reaction. Because nuclear reactions are much more powerful than chemical ones, a large volume of chemicals can be replaced by a small reactor. As the heat source is independent of the working mass, the working fluid can be selected for maximum performance for a given task, not its underlying reaction energy. Due to its low molecular mass, hydrogen is normally used. This combination of features allows a nuclear engine to outperform a chemical one; they generally aim to have at least twice the specific impulse of a chemical engine.

=== Design concepts ===
In general form, a nuclear engine is similar to a liquid chemical engine. Both hold the working mass in a large tank and pump it to the reaction chamber using a turbopump. The difference is primarily in that the reaction chamber is generally larger, the size of the reactor. Complicating factors were immediately apparent. The first was that a means had to be found of controlling reactor temperature and power output. The second was that a means had to be devised to hold the propellant. The only practical means of storing hydrogen was in liquid form, and this required temperatures below . The third was that the hydrogen would be heated to a temperature of around , and materials were required that could both withstand such temperatures and resist corrosion by hydrogen.

For the fuel, plutonium-239, uranium-235 and uranium-233 were considered. Plutonium was rejected because it forms compounds easily and could not reach temperatures as high as those of uranium. Uranium-233 is slightly lighter than uranium-235, releases a higher number of neutrons per fission event on average, and has higher probability of fission, but its radioactive properties make it more difficult to handle, and it was not readily available. Uranium-235 was therefore chosen.

For structural materials in the reactor, the choice came down to graphite or metal. Of the metals, tungsten emerged as the front runner, but it was expensive, hard to fabricate, and had undesirable neutronic properties. To get around its neutronic properties, it was suggested tungsten-184, which does not absorb neutrons, should be used. On the other hand, graphite was cheap, actually gets stronger at temperatures up to , and sublimes rather than melts at . Graphite was therefore chosen.

To control the reactor, the core was surrounded by control drums coated with graphite or beryllium (a neutron moderator) on one side and boron (a neutron poison) on the other. The reactor&#x27;s power output could be controlled by rotating the drums. To increase thrust, it is sufficient to increase the flow of propellant. Hydrogen, whether in pure form or in a compound like ammonia, is an efficient nuclear moderator, and increasing the flow also increases the rate of reactions in the core. This increased reaction rate offsets the cooling provided by the hydrogen. Moreover, as the hydrogen heats up, it expands, so there is less in the core to remove heat, and the temperature will level off. These opposing effects stabilize the reactivity and a nuclear rocket engine is therefore naturally very stable, and the thrust is easily controlled by varying the hydrogen flow without changing the control drums.

NERVA incorporated a radiation shield to protect personnel and external components from the intense neutron and photon radiation it emitted. An efficient lightweight shield material was developed by the Aerojet Nuclear Systems Company from a mixture of boron carbide (), aluminum and titanium hydride (), known as BATH after its components. Titanium hydride is an excellent neutron moderator and boron carbide an excellent neutron absorber. The three components were mixed in powdered form and a commercial extrusion machine was used to extrude them into the desired shape. BATH was found to be strong, with a tensile strength of up to , capable of withstanding high temperatures, and with superior radiation shielding properties. 

LASL produced a series of design concepts, each with its own codename: Uncle Tom, Uncle Tung, Bloodhound and Shish. By 1955, it had settled on a 1,500 MW design called Old Black Joe. In 1956, this became the basis of a 2,700 MW design intended to be the upper stage of an ICBM.

=== Test site ===

Nuclear reactors for Project Rover were built at LASL Technical Area 18 (TA-18), also known as the Pajarito Site. The reactors were tested at very low power before being shipped to Jackass Flats in the Nevada Test Site. Testing of fuel elements and other materials science was done by the LASL N Division at TA-46 using several ovens and later the Nuclear Furnace.

Work commenced on test facilities at Jackass Flats in mid-1957. All materials and supplies had to be brought in from Las Vegas. Test Cell A consisted of a farm of hydrogen gas bottles and a concrete wall thick to protect the electronic instrumentation from radiation produced by the reactor. The control room was located away. The reactor was test fired with its plume in the air so that radioactive products could be safely dissipated.

The reactor maintenance and disassembly building (R-MAD) was in most respects a typical hot cell used by the nuclear industry, with thick concrete walls, lead glass viewing windows, and remote manipulation arms. It was exceptional only for its size: long, wide and high. This allowed the engine to be moved in and out on a railroad car.

The &quot;Jackass and Western Railroad&quot;, as it was light-heartedly described, was said to be the world&#x27;s shortest and slowest railroad. There were two locomotives, the remotely controlled electric L-1, and the diesel/electric L-2, which was manually controlled but had radiation shielding around the cab. The former was normally used; the latter was provided as a backup. Construction workers were housed in Mercury, Nevada. Later thirty mobile homes were brought to Jackass Flats to create a village named &quot;Boyerville&quot; after the supervisor, Keith Boyer. Construction work was completed in the fall of 1958. NASA planned to develop a community of 2,700 people, with 800 dwellings and their own shopping complex by 1967.

=== Transfer to NASA ===

By 1957, the Atlas missile project was proceeding well, and the need for a nuclear upper stage had all but disappeared. On 2 October 1957, the AEC proposed cutting its budget. Two days later, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. This surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world. It demonstrated that the Soviet Union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances, and contested cherished American notions of military, economic and technological superiority. This precipitated the Sputnik crisis, and triggered the Space Race. President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by creating ARPA to oversee military rocket and technology development, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to direct civilian rocket development. NASA absorbed NACA as part of its formation, along with several former military programs.

NACA had long been interested in nuclear technology. In 1951, it had begun exploring the possibility of acquiring its own nuclear reactor for the aircraft nuclear propulsion (ANP) project, and selected its Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in Ohio to design, build and manage it. A site was chosen at the nearby Plum Brook Ordnance Works, NACA obtained approval from the AEC, and construction of the Plum Brook Reactor commenced in September 1956. Abe Silverstein, the director of Lewis, was particularly eager to acquire control of Project Rover.

Donald A. Quarles, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, met with T. Keith Glennan, the new administrator of NASA, and Hugh Dryden, Glennan&#x27;s deputy on 20 August 1958, the day they after Glennan and Dryden were sworn into office at the White House, and Rover was the first item on the agenda. Quarles was eager to transfer Rover to NASA, as the project no longer had a military purpose. Responsibility for the non-nuclear components of Project Rover was officially transferred from the United States Air Force (USAF) to NASA on 1 October 1958, the day NASA officially became operational and assumed responsibility for the US civilian space program.

=== Space Nuclear Propulsion Office ===

Project Rover became a joint NASAâAEC project. Silverstein, whom Glennan had brought to Washington, DC, to organise NASA&#x27;s spaceflight program, appointed Harold Finger to oversee the nuclear rocket development as head of NASA&#x27;s Office of Space Reactors. Senator Anderson had doubts about Finger&#x27;s suitability for the job. He felt that Finger lacked enthusiasm for it. Glenn met with Anderson on 13 April 1959, and convinced him that Finger would do a good job. On 29 August 1960, NASA created the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office (SNPO) to oversee the nuclear rocket project. Finger was appointed as its manager, with Milton Klein from AEC as his deputy. Finger was also the Director of Nuclear Systems in the NASA Office of Advanced Research and Technology. A formal &quot;Agreement Between NASA and AEC on Management of Nuclear Rocket Engine Contracts&quot; was signed by NASA Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans and AEC General Manager Alvin Luedecke on 1 February 1961. This was followed by an &quot;Inter-Agency Agreement on the Program for the Development of Space Nuclear Rocket Propulsion (Project Rover)&quot;, which they signed on 28 July 1961. SNPO also assumed responsibility for SNAP, Armstrong becoming assistant to the director of the Reactor Development Division at AEC, and Lieutenant Colonel G. M. Anderson, formerly the SNAP project officer in the disbanded ANP Office, became chief of the SNAP Branch in the new division. It soon became apparent that there were considerable cultural differences between NASA and AEC.
SNPO Headquarters was co-located with AEC Headquarters in Germantown, Maryland. Finger established branch offices at Albuquerque, New Mexico, (SNPO-A) to liaise with LASL, and in Cleveland, Ohio, (SNPO-C) to coordinate with the Lewis Research Center, which was activated in October 1961. In February 1962, NASA announced the establishment of the Nuclear Rocket Development Station (NRDS) at Jackass Flats, and in June an SNPO branch was established at Las Vegas (SNPO-N) to manage it. By the end of 1963, there were 13 NASA personnel at SNPO Headquarters, 59 at SNPO-C and 30 at SNPO-N. SNPO staff were a combination of NASA and AEC employees whose responsibilities included &quot;program and resource planning and evaluation, the justification and distribution of program resources, the definition and control of overall program requirements, monitoring and reporting of progress and problems to NASA and AEC management, and the preparation of testimony to Congress.&quot;

Finger called for bids from industry for the development of the nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application (NERVA) based upon the Kiwi engine developed by LASL. The award was scheduled for 1 March 1961, so that the decision whether or not to proceed could be made by the incoming Kennedy administration. Eight companies submitted bids: Aerojet, Douglas, Glenn L. Martin, Lockheed, North American, Rocketdyne, Thiokol and Westinghouse. A joint NASAâAEC board evaluated the bids. It rated North American&#x27;s bid as the best bid overall, but Westinghouse and Aerojet had superior bids for the reactor and engine respectively when they were considered separately. After Aerojet promised NASA administrator James E. Webb that it would put its best people on NERVA, Webb spoke to the selection board and told them that although he did not wish to influence their decision, North American was deeply committed to Project Apollo, and the board might consider combining other bids. On 8 June, Webb announced that Aerojet and Westinghouse had been selected. Aerojet became the prime contractor, with Westinghouse as the principal subcontractor. Both companies recruited aggressively, and by 1963, Westinghouse had 1,100 staff working on NERVA.

In March 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced the cancellation of the aircraft nuclear propulsion project just as NASA&#x27;s Plum Brook reactor was nearing completion, and for a time it seemed that NERVA would soon follow. NASA estimated that NERVA would ultimately cost $800 million (although AEC reckoned that it would be much less), and the Bureau of the Budget argued that NERVA made sense only in the context of a crewed lunar landing or flights further into the Solar System, to neither of which had the administration committed. Then, on 12 April, the Soviet Union launched Yuri Gagarin into orbit on Vostok 1, once again demonstrating its technological superiority. A few days later, Kennedy launched the disastrous Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba, resulting in yet another humiliation for the United States. On 25 May, he addressed a joint session of Congress. &quot;First,&quot; he announced, &quot;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.&quot; He then went on to say: &quot;Secondly, an additional 23 million dollars, together with 7 million dollars already available, will accelerate development of the Rover nuclear rocket. This gives promise of someday providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the Solar System itself.&quot;

== Towards Reactor In-Flight Tests ==

The SNPO set an objective for NERVA of 99.7 percent reliability, meaning that the engine would fail to perform as designed no more than three times in every thousand starts. To achieve this, Aerojet and Westinghouse estimated that they would require 6 reactors, 28 engines and 6 reactor in-flight test (RIFT) flights. They planned for 42 tests, considerably fewer than the 60 tests that the SNPO had thought might be required. Unlike other aspects of NERVA, RIFT was solely a NASA responsibility. NASA delegated responsibility for RIFT to Wernher von Braun&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. Von Braun created a Nuclear Vehicle Projects Office at MSFC, headed by Colonel Scott Fellows, a USAF officer who had worked on ANP.

At this time, NASA was engaged in planning for the lunar landing mission that Kennedy had called for. In the process the agency considered several booster concepts, including what became the Saturn family and the larger Nova. These were chemical rockets, although nuclear upper stages were also considered for Nova. The December 1959 Silverstein Committee had defined the configuration of the Saturn launch vehicle, including the use of liquid hydrogen as the fuel for the upper stages.

In a 1960 paper, Schmidt proposed replacing the upper stages with nuclear NERVA stages. This would deliver the same performance as Nova, but for half the cost. He estimated the cost of putting a pound of payload into lunar orbit as $1,600 for an all-chemical Saturn, $1,100 for Nova, and $700 for a chemical-nuclear Saturn. MSFC issued a study contract for a RIFT with NERVA as the upper stage of a Saturn C-3, but the C-3 was replaced soon after by the more powerful C-4 and ultimately the C-5, which became the Saturn V. Only in July 1962, after much debate, did NASA finally settle on lunar orbit rendezvous, which could be performed by Saturn V, negating the need for the larger and more expensive Nova, which was abandoned.

The RIFT test vehicle would be tall, about the same as the Saturn V; the Saturn C-5N mission configuration would be larger still, at tall, but the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) could easily accommodate it. It would consist of an S-IC first stage, a dummy S-II middle stage filled with water, and an S-N (Saturn-Nuclear) NERVA upper stage. For an actual mission, a real S-II stage would be used. The S-N stage was to be built by Lockheed in a dirigible hangar NASA acquired at Moffet Field in Sunnyvale, California, and assembled at NASA&#x27;s Mississippi Test Facility.

The SNPO planned to build ten S-N stages, six for ground tests and four for flight tests. Launches were to take place from Cape Canaveral. NERVA engines would be transported by road in shockproof, watertight containers, with the control rods locked in place and nuclear poison wires in the core. Since it would not be radioactive, it could be safely transported and mated to the lower stages without shielding. In flight, the poison wires would be pulled and the reactor started above the Atlantic Ocean. The engine would fire for 1,300 seconds, boosting it to an altitude of . It would then be shut down, and the reactor cooled before impacting the Atlantic downrange. NERVA would be regarded as mission ready after four successful tests.

To support RIFT, LASL established a Rover Flight Safety Office and SNPO created a Rover Flight Safety Panel. Since RIFT called for up to four reactors to fall into the Atlantic Ocean, LASL attempted to determine what would happen when a reactor hit the water at several thousand kilometers per hour. In particular, whether it would go critical or explode when flooded with sea water, a neutron moderator. There was also concern about what would happen when it sank down to the bottom of the Atlantic, where it would be under a crushing pressure. The possible impact on marine life, and indeed what marine life was down there, all had to be considered.

The main bottleneck in the NERVA program was the test facilities at Jackass Flats. Test Cell C was supposed to be complete in 1960. NASA and AEC did not request funds for further construction, but Anderson provided them anyway. There were construction delays, forcing Anderson to intervene personally. He assumed the role of de facto construction manager, with the AEC officials reporting directly to him.

In August 1961, the Soviet Union ended the nuclear test moratorium that had been in place since November 1958, so Kennedy resumed US nuclear weapons testing in September. With a second crash program at the Nevada Test site, labor became scarce, and there was a strike. When that ended, the workers had to come to grips with the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen, which could leak through microscopic holes that were too small for other fluids to pass through. On 7 November 1961, a minor accident caused a violent hydrogen release. The complex finally became operational in 1964. SNPO envisaged the construction of a 20,000 MW nuclear rocket engine, so Boyer had the Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company construct two gigantic cryogenic storage dewars. An engine maintenance and disassembly building (E-MAD) was added. It had thick concrete walls and shield bays where engines could be assembled and disassembled. There was also an engine test stand (ETS-1); two more were planned.

In March 1963, SNPO and MSFC commissioned Space Technology Laboratories (STL) to produce a report on what kind of nuclear rocket engine would be required for possible missions between 1975 and 1990. These missions included early crewed planetary interplanetary round-trip expeditions (EMPIRE), planetary swingbys and flybys, and a lunar shuttle. The conclusion of this nine-volume report, which was delivered in March 1965, and of a follow-up study, was that these missions could be carried out with a 4,100 MW engine with a specific impulse of . This was considerably smaller than had originally been thought necessary. From this emerged a specification for a 5,000 MW nuclear rocket engine, which became known as NERVA II.

=== Kiwi ===

The first phase of Project Rover, Kiwi, was named after the New Zealand kiwi bird. A kiwi cannot fly, and the Kiwi rocket engines were not intended to do so either. Their function was to verify the design, and test the behavior of the materials used. The Kiwi program developed a series of non-flyable test nuclear engines, the primary focus being to improve the technology of hydrogen-cooled reactors. In the Kiwi A series of tests conducted between July 1959 and October 1960, three reactors were built and tested. Kiwi A was considered a success as a proof of concept for nuclear rocket engines. It demonstrated that hydrogen could be heated in a nuclear reactor to the temperatures required for space propulsion and that the reactor could be controlled.

The next step was the Kiwi B series of tests, which commenced with Kiwi B1A on 7 December 1961. This was a development of the Kiwi A engine, with a series of improvements. The second test in the series, Kiwi B1B on 1 September 1962, resulted in extreme structural damage to the reactor, fuel module components being ejected as it was ramped up to full power. A subsequent full-power Kiwi B4A test on 30 November 1962, along with a series of cold flow tests, revealed that the problem was vibrations that were induced when the hydrogen was heated as the reactor was being brought up to full power rather than when it was running at full power. Unlike a chemical engine that would likely have blown up after suffering catastrophic damage, the nuclear rocket engine remained stable and controllable even when tested to destruction. The tests demonstrated that a nuclear rocket engine would be rugged and reliable in space.

Kennedy visited LASL on 7 December 1962 for a briefing on Project Rover. It was the first time a president had visited a nuclear weapons laboratory. He brought with him a large entourage that included Lyndon Johnson, McGeorge Bundy, Jerome Wiesner, Harold Brown, Donald Hornig, Glenn Seaborg, Robert Seamans, Harold Finger, Clinton Anderson, Howard Cannon and Alan Bible. The next day, they flew to Jackass Flats, making Kennedy the only president to ever visit a nuclear test site. Project Rover had received $187 million in 1962, and AEC and NASA were asking for another $360 million in 1963. Kennedy drew attention to his administration&#x27;s budgetary difficulties, and asked what the relationship was between Project Rover and Apollo. Finger replied that it was an insurance policy, and could be used in the later Apollo or post-Apollo missions, such as a base on the Moon or a mission to Mars. Wiesner, supported by Brown and Hornig, argued that if a Mars mission could not occur before the 1980s, then RIFT could be postponed to the 1970s. Seamans noted that such an attitude had resulted in the Sputnik crisis and a loss of American prestige and influence.
In January 1963, Senator Anderson became chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences. He met privately with Kennedy, who agreed to request a supplemental appropriation for RIFT if a &quot;quick fix&quot; to the Kiwi vibration problem that Seaborg promised could be implemented. In the meantime, Finger called a meeting. He declared that there would be no &quot;quick fix&quot;. He criticized LASL&#x27;s management structure and called for LASL to adopt a project management structure. He wanted the case of the vibration problems thoroughly investigated, and the cause definitely known before corrective action was taken. Three SNPO staff (known at LASL as the &quot;three blind mice&quot;) were assigned to LASL to ensure that his instructions were carried out. Finger assembled a team of vibration specialists from other NASA centers, and along with staff from LASL, Aerojet and Westinghouse, conducted a series of &quot;cold flow&quot; reactor tests using fuel elements without fissionable material. RIFT was cancelled in December 1963. Although its reinstatement was frequently discussed, it never occurred.

A series of design changes were made to address the vibration problem. In the Kiwi B4D test on 13 May 1964, the reactor was automatically started and briefly run at full power with no vibration problems. This was followed by the Kiwi B4E test on 28 August in which the reactor was operated for twelve minutes, eight of which were at full power. On 10 September, Kiwi B4E was restarted, and run at full power for two and a half minutes, demonstrating the ability of a nuclear rocket engine to be shut down and restarted. In September, tests were conducted with a Kiwi B4 engine and PARKA, a Kiwi reactor used for testing at LASL. The two reactors were run , and apart, and reactivity measurements were taken. These tests showed that neutrons produced by one reactor did indeed cause fissions in another, but that the effect was negligible: 3, 12 and 24 cents respectively. The tests demonstrated that nuclear rocket engines can be clustered, just as chemical ones often are.

=== NERVA NRX ===

SNPO chose the Kiwi-B4 nuclear thermal rocket design (with a specific impulse of 825 seconds) as the baseline for the NERVA NRX (NERVA Reactor Experiment). Whereas Kiwi was a proof of concept, NERVA NRX was a prototype of a complete engine. That meant that it would need actuators to turn the drums and start the engine, gimbals to control its movement, a nozzle cooled by liquid hydrogen, and shielding to protect the engine, payload and crew from radiation. Westinghouse modified the cores to make them more robust for flight conditions. Some research and development was still required. The available temperature sensors were accurate only up to , far below what was required. New sensors were developed that were accurate to , even in a high-radiation environment. Aerojet and Westinghouse attempted to theoretically predict the performance of each component. This was then compared to the actual test performance. Over time, the two converged as more was understood. By 1972, the performance of a NERVA engine under most conditions could be accurately forecast.

The first test of a NERVA engine was of NERVA A2 on 24 September 1964. Aerojet and Westinghouse cautiously increased the power incrementally, to 2 MW, 570 MW, 940 MW, running for a minute or two at each level to check the instruments, before finally increasing to full power at 1,096 MW. The reactor ran flawlessly, and only had to be shut down after 40 seconds because the hydrogen was running out. The test demonstrated that NERVA had the designed specific impulse of ; solid-propellant rockets have a maximum impulse of around and chemical rockets with liquid propellant seldom achieve more than . Executives at Aerojet and Westinghouse were so pleased they took out a full-page ad in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; with a picture of the test and the caption: &quot;On to Mars!&quot; The reactor was restarted on 15 October. Originally this was intended to test the nozzle, but that was dropped as it was close to its design maximum of . Instead, the turbopump was tested. The engine was powered up to 40 MW, the control drums were locked in place, and the turbopump was used to keep the power steady at 40 MW. It worked perfectly. The computer simulations had been correct, and the whole project was ahead of schedule.
The next test was of NERVA A3 on 23 April 1965. This test was intended to verify that the engine could be run and restarted at full power. The engine was operated for eight minutes, three and a half of them at full power, before the instruments indicated that too much hydrogen was going into the engine. A scram was ordered, but a coolant line became clogged. Power increased to 1,165 MW before the line unclogged, and the engine shut down gracefully. There were fears for the integrity of the tie rods that held the fuel clusters together. They were supposed to operate at , with a maximum of . The sensors recorded that the tie rods had reached , which was the maximum that the sensors could record. Laboratory tests later confirmed that the rods might have reached . There was also what appeared to be a hole in the nozzle, but this turned out to be soot. The robust engine was undamaged, so the test continued, and the engine was run for thirteen minutes at 1,072 MW. Once again, the test time was limited only by the available hydrogen.

Testing of NASA&#x27;s NERVA NRX/EST (Engine System Test) commenced on 3 February 1966. The objectives were:
# Demonstrate the feasibility of starting and restarting the engine without an external power source.
# Evaluate the control system characteristics (stability and control mode) during startup, shutdown, cooldown and restart for a variety of initial conditions.
# Investigate the system stability over a broad operating range.
# Investigate the endurance capability of the engine components, especially the reactor, during transient and steady-state operation with multiple restarts.

The NRX/EST was run at intermediate power levels on 3 and 11 February, with a full power (1,055 MW) test on 3 March, followed by engine duration tests on 16 and 25 March. The engine was started eleven times. All test objectives were successfully accomplished, and NRX/EST operated for a total of nearly two hours, including 28 minutes at full power. It exceeded the operating time of previous Kiwi reactors by nearly a factor of two.

The next objective was to run the reactors continuously for an extended length of time. The NRX A5 was started up on 8 June 1966, and run at full power for fifteen and a half minutes. During cooldown, a bird landed on the nozzle and was asphyxiated by the nitrogen or helium gas, dropping onto the core. It was feared that it might block the propellant lines or create uneven heating before being blown out again when the engine was restarted, so the Westinghouse engineers rigged a television camera and a vacuum hose, and were able to remove the bird while safely behind a concrete wall. The engine was restarted on 23 June and run at full power for another fourteen and a half minutes. Although there was severe corrosion, resulting in about $2.20 of reactivity lost, the engine could still have been restarted, but the engineers wanted to examine the core.

An hour was now set as the goal for the NRX A6 test. This was beyond the capacity of Test Cell A, so testing now moved to Test Cell C with its giant dewars. NRX A5 was therefore the last test to use Test Cell A. The reactor was started on 7 December 1966, but a shutdown was ordered 75 seconds into the test due to a faulty electrical component. This was followed by a postponement due to inclement weather. NRX A6 was started up again on 15 December. It ran at full power (1,125 MW) with a chamber temperature of over and pressure of , and a flow rate of . It took 75.3 hours to cool the reactor with liquid nitrogen. On examination, it was found that the beryllium reflector had cracked due to thermal stress. The test caused the abandonment of plans to build a more powerful NERVA II engine. If more thrust was required, a NERVA I engine could be run longer, or it could be clustered.

===NERVA XE===

With the success of the A6 test, SNPO cancelled planned follow-on tests A7 and A8 and concentrated on completing ETS-1. All previous tests had the engine firing upwards; ETS-1 would permit an engine to be reoriented to fire downward into a reduced-pressure compartment to partly simulate firing in the vacuum of space. The test stand provided a reduced atmospheric pressure of about â equivalent to being at an altitude of . This was done by injecting water into the exhaust, which created superheated steam that surged out at high speeds, creating a vacuum.

ETS-1 took longer for Aerojet to complete than expected, partly due to shrinking budgets, but also because of technical challenges. It was built from pure aluminum, which did not become radioactive when irradiated by neutrons, and there was a water spray to keep it cool. Rubber gaskets were a problem, as they tended to turn into goo in a radioactive environment; metal ones had to be used. The most challenging part was the exhaust ducts, which were required to handle much higher temperatures than their chemical rocket counterparts. The steel work was carried out by Allegheny Technologies, and the Air Preheater Company fabricated the pipes. The work required of steel, of welding wire and of welds. During a test the 234 tubes would have to carry up to of water. To save money on cabling, Aerojet moved the control room to a bunker away.

The second NERVA engine, the NERVA XE, was designed to come as close as possible to a complete flight system, even to the point of using a flight-design turbopump. To save time and money, components that would not affect the engine&#x27;s performance were selected from what was available at Jackass Flats. A radiation shield was added to protect external components. The test objectives included testing the use of ETS-1 at Jackass Flats for flight engine qualification and acceptance. Total run time was 115 minutes, including 28 starts. NASA and SNPO felt that the test &quot;confirmed that a nuclear rocket engine was suitable for space flight application and was able to operate at a specific impulse twice that of chemical rocket system[s].&quot; The engine was deemed adequate for Mars missions being planned by NASA. The facility was also deemed adequate for flight qualification and acceptance of rocket engines from the two contractors.

The final test of the series was XE Prime. This engine was long, in diameter, and weighed approximately . It was designed to produce a nominal thrust of with a specific impulse of . When the reactor was operating at full power, about 1,140 MW, the chamber temperature was , chamber pressure was , and the flow rate was , of which was diverted into the cooldown system. A series of experiments were carried out between 4 December 1968 and 11 September 1969, during which the reactor was started 24 times, and ran at full power for 1,680 seconds.

==Cancellation==
At the time of the NERVA NRX/EST test, NASA&#x27;s plans for NERVA included a visit to Mars by 1978, a permanent lunar base by 1981, and deep space probes to Jupiter, Saturn, and the outer planets. NERVA rockets would be used for nuclear &quot;tugs&quot; designed to take payloads from low Earth orbit (LEO) to higher orbits as a component of the later-named Space Transportation System, resupply several space stations in orbit around the Earth and Moon, and support a permanent lunar base. The NERVA rocket could also be a nuclear-powered upper stage for the Saturn rocket, which would allow the upgraded Saturn to launch payloads of up to to LEO.
Defending NERVA from its critics like Hornig, the chairman of the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), required a series of bureaucratic and political battles as the rising cost of the Vietnam War put pressure on budgets. Congress defunded NERVA II in the 1967 budget, but President Johnson needed Senator Anderson&#x27;s support for his Medicare legislation, so on 7 February 1967 he provided the money for NERVA II from his own contingency fund. Klein, who had succeeded Finger as head of the SNPO in 1967, faced two hours of questioning on NERVA II before the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. In the end, the committee cut NASA&#x27;s budget. Defunding NERVA II saved $400 million, mainly in new facilities that would be required to test it. This time AEC and NASA acquiesced, because the NRX A6 test had demonstrated that NERVA I could perform the missions expected of NERVA II. The following year, Webb attempted to take money from NERVA I to pay for NASA overhead after Congress cut NASA&#x27;s budget to $3.8 billion. Johnson restored NERVA I&#x27;s funding, but not NASA&#x27;s.

NERVA had plenty of proposed missions. NASA considered using Saturn V and NERVA on a &quot;Grand Tour&quot; of the Solar System. A rare alignment of the planets that occurs every 174 years occurred between 1976 and 1980, allowing a spacecraft to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. With NERVA, that spacecraft could weigh up to . This was assuming NERVA had a specific impulse of only ; was more likely, and with that it could place a space station the size of Skylab into orbit around the Moon. Repeat trips to the Moon could be made with NERVA powering a nuclear shuttle. There was also of course the mission to Mars, which Klein diplomatically avoided mentioning, knowing that, even in the wake of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, the idea was unpopular with Congress and the general public.
Richard Nixon replaced Johnson as president on 20 January 1969, and cost cutting became the order of the day. NASA program funding was somewhat reduced by Congress for the federal budget, shutting down the Saturn V production line. On 4 January 1970, NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine announced the cancellation of Apollo 20 to make its Saturn V available to launch Skylab. The cancellation of Apollo 18 and 19 followed in September 1970. But NERVA remained; Klein endorsed a plan whereby the Space Shuttle would lift a NERVA engine into orbit, then later return with fuel and a payload. This could be repeated, as NERVA was restartable. NERVA now needed the shuttle, but the shuttle did not need NERVA. NERVA still had the steadfast support of Anderson and Cannon in the Senate, but Anderson was aging and tiring, and now delegated many of his duties to Cannon. NERVA received $88 million in fiscal year (FY) 1970 and $85 million in FY 1971, funds coming jointly from NASA and the AEC.

In December 1970, the Office of Management and Budget recommended the cancellation of NERVA and Skylab, but Nixon was reluctant to do so, as their cancellation could cost up to 20,000 jobs, mostly in California, a state that Nixon felt he needed to carry in the 1972 election. He decided to keep it alive at a low funding level, and cancel Apollo 17 instead. The concern about Apollo 17 was about the political fallout if it failed rather than the cost, and this was ultimately addressed by postponing it to December 1972, after the election. When Nixon tried to kill NERVA in 1971, Senator Anderson and Senator Margaret Chase Smith instead killed Nixon&#x27;s pet project, the Boeing 2707 supersonic transport (SST). This was a stunning defeat for the president. In the budget for FY 1972, funding for the shuttle was cut, but NERVA and Apollo 17 survived. Although NERVA&#x27;s budget request was only $17.4 million, Congress allocated $69 million; Nixon only spent $29 million of it.

Congress supported NERVA again in 1972. A bipartisan coalition headed by Smith and Cannon appropriated $100 million for the small NERVA engine that would fit inside the shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay that was estimated to cost about $250 million over a decade. They added a stipulation that there would be no more reprogramming NERVA funds to pay for other NASA activities. The Nixon administration decided to cancel NERVA anyway. On 5 January 1973, NASA announced that NERVA was terminated. Staff at LASL and SNPO were stunned; the project to build a small NERVA had been proceeding well. Layoffs began immediately, and the SNPO was abolished in June. After 17 years of research and development, Projects Nova and NERVA had spent about $1.4 billion, but NERVA had never flown.

==Post-NERVA research==
In 1983, the Strategic Defense Initiative (&quot;Star Wars&quot;) identified missions that could benefit from rockets that are more powerful than chemical rockets, and some that could only be undertaken by more powerful rockets. A nuclear propulsion project, SP-100, was created in February 1983 with the aim of developing a 100 KW nuclear rocket system. The concept incorporated a particle/pebble-bed reactor, a concept developed by James R. Powell at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, which promised a specific impulse of up to and a thrust to weight ratio of between 25 and 35 for thrust levels greater than .
From 1987 to 1991 this was funded as a secret project codenamed Project Timber Wind, which spent $139 million. The proposed rocket project was transferred to the Space Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (SNTP) program at the Air Force Phillips Laboratory in October 1991. NASA conducted studies as part of its 1992 Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) but felt that SNTP offered insufficient improvement over NERVA, and was not required by any SEI missions. The SNTP program was terminated in January 1994, after $200 million was spent.

In 2013, an engine for interplanetary travel from Earth orbit to Mars orbit and back was studied at the MSFC with a focus on nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) engines. Since NTRs are at least twice as efficient as the most advanced chemical engines, they allow quicker transfer times and increased cargo capacity. The shorter flight duration, estimated at 3â4 months with NTR engines, compared to 8â9 months using chemical engines, would reduce crew exposure to potentially harmful and difficult to shield cosmic rays. NTR engines were selected in the Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA).
Congress approved $125 million in funding for the development of nuclear thermal propulsion rockets on 22 May 2019. On 19 October 2020, the Seattle-based firm Ultra Safe Nuclear Technologies delivered a NTR design concept to NASA employing high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) ZrC-encapsulated fuel particles as part of a NASA-sponsored NTR study managed by Analytical Mechanics Associates (AMA). In January 2023, NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced that they would collaborate on the development of a nuclear thermal rocket engine that would be tested in space to develop nuclear propulsion capability for use in crewed NASA missions to Mars. In 2023, DARPA announced that the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) reactor and fuel would be supplied by BWXT.

<text>&quot;The Pilot&quot; (also known as &quot;The One Where Monica Gets a Roommate&quot;, &quot;The First One&quot;, and &quot;The One Where It All Began&quot;) is the pilot episode and series premiere of the American television sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. The episode premiered on NBC on September 22, 1994. It was written by the show&#x27;s creators, David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and directed by James Burrows. The pilot introduces six twenty-something friends who live and work in New York City: Monica Geller, a single sous chef in her mid 20s who is illegally subletting her grandmother&#x27;s apartment; Ross Geller, Monica&#x27;s older brother, a paleontologist whose marriage recently ended after he learned his wife, Carol, is a lesbian; Rachel Green, Monica&#x27;s spoiled, self-centered, high-school best friend who has just left her fiancÃ© at the altar and is financially cut off by her father; Chandler Bing, Ross&#x27;s college roommate and best friend who lives across the hall from Monica; Joey Tribbiani, a struggling Italian-American actor and Chandler&#x27;s roommate; and Phoebe Buffay, a laid-back, hippie-ish masseuse, singer and guitar player.

Crane and Kauffman pitched their original idea to network NBC in 1993. NBC liked it and commissioned a complete script, which was submitted in 1994. Before the script was finished, casting for the six main roles began; 75 actors were seen for each part. The &quot;Friends&quot; pilot episode was taped on May 4, at Warner Bros.&#x27; studios in Burbank, California. After making final edits to the episode, executive producer Kevin Bright submitted it on May 11, two days before NBC was due to announce the schedule. Satisfied with the completed pilot, NBC ordered 12 more episodes for the first season. The episode was watched by approximately 22Â million viewers, making it the fifteenth-most-watched television show of the week. Critics compared the show unfavorably to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Ellen&quot;, noting the similarities all three series had in depicting friends conversing about their lives. The cast, particularly Schwimmer, were complimented, though there was some concern that the character roles were undeveloped and that the plot for the pilot would not go over well with audiences.

== Plot ==
At the Central Perk coffee shop, Monica Geller is teased by her friends, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani, about going out with someone and claiming it is not a date. Ross Geller, Monica&#x27;s older brother, arrives at the coffee shop, upset that his lesbian ex-wife has moved out of their apartment to begin a new relationship with her partner. A young woman suddenly arrives wearing a wet wedding dress, whom Monica recognizes as her high-school best friend, Rachel Green. Monica introduces her to the others as Rachel reveals she left her fiancÃ© at the altar, realizing that she does not love him. After Rachel&#x27;s father cuts her off financially over the phone, Monica reluctantly takes Rachel in as a new roommate.

Meanwhile, Joey and Chandler console Ross while helping him assemble new furniture. Ross begins to wonder if any woman would be &quot;the right one&quot; for him. Monica goes on her first date with Paul the &quot;wine guy&quot;, who confides in her that he has not been able to perform sexually since his wife left him. Monica is touched by his admission, and they sleep together. The next day, however, she learns from a coworker that Paul&#x27;s story about his ex-wife is just a ruse to bed women. After her attempts to get a job are unsuccessful, Rachel ends up buying a new pair of boots with one of her credit cards, which she admits her father pays for. Egged on by the group, Rachel reluctantly cuts up her credit cards to announce her independence.

That night, Ross and Rachel talk and he confesses that he once was infatuated with her during high school; she admits that she knew. He asks if he can ask her out sometime, and she says yes. Ross leaves the apartment feeling newfound hope. In the final scene, the entire group is in Central Perk having coffee with Rachel, who begins a new career as a coffee shop waitress.

== Production ==
=== Conception ===
Creators and writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman were known in the television industry for writing the cable television series &quot;Dream On&quot;. A second series by the duo, &quot;Family Album&quot;, had premiered on CBS in the Fall of 1993 season but was cancelled after airing six episodes. In November 1993, they began developing three new television pilots from their offices at Warner Bros. Television that could premiere in the Fall 1994 season. As &quot;Dream On&quot; had won them clout in Hollywood, they aimed to pitch one of their ideas to NBC; &quot;Insomnia Cafe&quot;, about six friends who live and work in New York City, was pitched as a seven-page treatment to the network in December 1993.

&quot;It&#x27;s about sex, love, relationships, careers, a time in your life when everything&#x27;s possible. And it&#x27;s about friendship because when you&#x27;re single and in the city, your friends are your family.&quot;
:âÂ Part of Crane and Kauffman&#x27;s original pitch for &quot;Insomnia Cafe&quot;

NBC bought the pitch as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed. To get an idea of how their characters would behave, Kauffman interviewed several of her children&#x27;s twenty-something babysitters. She and Crane wrote the script in three days. James Burrows, known for directing &quot;Cheers&quot;, was hired to direct it. He liked the script, though asked for Joey, who was originally written similarly to Chandler, to be &quot;dumbed up a bit&quot;. The script was completed in early March 1994, though before then eight-line character breakdowns had been sent to acting agencies in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.

=== Casting ===
1,000 actors replied to the callouts for each role, but only 75 were called in to read for the casting director. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman, and their production partner Kevin S. Bright. At the end of March, the potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part; they read for Les Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television. David Schwimmer was first to be cast. He was in Chicago doing a stage adaptation of &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; when his agent offered him the audition. He was not interested in doing television after a bad experience appearing in &quot;Monty&quot;, but changed his mind when he learned that it was an ensemble script. Unknown to him, Crane and Kauffman had remembered him from when he auditioned for an earlier pilot of theirs; they had written the part of Ross with Schwimmer in mind to play him. Eric McCormack also auditioned for the role several times. He later became famous for his lead role as Will Truman in the sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

Courteney Cox was the most well-known of the six main actors. She was being considered for Rachel, but Cox read the script and thought she was a better fit for Monica. After reading for Monica instead, she won the role. Nancy McKeon also read for the part. Jennifer Aniston read for the part of Rachel after initially being considered for Monica. Her contract with the CBS TV series &quot;Muddling Through&quot; meant that any role with &quot;Friends&quot; would be in second position to the series. The CBS show was not scheduled to be broadcast until mid-1994 after NBC announced whether &quot;Friends&quot; would be greenlit; if &quot;Muddling Through&quot; became a rating success and CBS enforced Aniston&#x27;s contract, &quot;Friends&quot; would have had to recast her. Within three days of first auditioning for &quot;Friends&quot; Aniston nonetheless got the role, because NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield correctly expected that &quot;Muddling Through&quot; would immediately fail. Crane and Kauffman wanted Joey to be &quot;a guy&#x27;s guy&quot; who loves &quot;women, sports, women, New York, women&quot;. The actors auditioned using the &quot;grab a spoon&quot; scene, and many arrived in character with &quot;lots of chest showing&quot;. As the Joey character was not developed much in the script, Matt LeBlanc just used his experience playing &quot;this Italian, kind of dim character&quot; from &quot;Vinnie &amp; Bobby&quot;. He had at least eight auditions for the part, and in his final one read with Aniston and Cox. Vince Vaughn also read for the part.

Chandler and Phoebe had originally been written as more secondary characters who were just there to provide humor around the other four; Matthew Perry described Chandler in the pilot script as &quot;an observer of other people&#x27;s lives&quot;. They had become part of the core group by the time casting concluded. Crane believed that the part of Chandler, described in the character breakdown as &quot;a droll, dry guy&quot;, would be the easiest to cast, though it proved more difficult than he initially hoped. Perry had previously worked with Kauffman and Crane on an episode of &quot;Dream On&quot;, and requested an audition when he identified with the character. He was turned down due to his involvement as a cast member in &quot;LAX 2194&quot;, a television pilot about airport baggage handlers in the future. After the producers of &quot;Friends&quot; saw &quot;LAX 2194&quot;, it became clear to them that it would not be picked up for a series, and Perry was granted an audition. He read for the role near the end of the casting period and got it in under a week. Before Perry was cast, Craig Bierko was first choice for the role. Bierko was a friend of Perry&#x27;s, and Perry coached him for his audition to help him get to know what the Chandler character was like. Jon Cryer had also auditioned for the part. He was doing a play in London and read for a British casting director, though his audition tape did not arrive at Warner Bros. in time for him to be considered.

Many actresses who read for Phoebe arrived at the audition in character, wearing &quot;bell bottoms and clunky shoes and nose rings&quot;. Kathy Griffin and Jane Lynch auditioned for the role. Lisa Kudrow won the role because the producers liked her as Ursula, the waitress in &quot;Mad About You&quot;. She was second to be cast, though there was about a month between her and Schwimmer being signed on. Many of the actors seen by Moonves were &quot;too theatrical&quot; in performing comedy; Crane described the six successful actors as being the only ones who &quot;nailed&quot; their parts. The six actors met for the first time altogether at the read-through on April 28, 1994. John Allen Nelson and Clea Lewis guest-star as Paul and Franny, Monica&#x27;s date and co-worker, respectively. Cynthia Mann appears as a Central Perk waitress.

=== Filming ===
A dress rehearsal was held on May 2, two days before taping. Several NBC executives watched the rehearsal and were concerned that Monica did not care enough about Paul to sleep with him on their first date. NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer believed that the audience would perceive her as &quot;a slut&quot;. Crane, Kauffman and Warner Bros. executives disagreed, and surveyed the other people watching the rehearsal to support their position. Despite the audience agreeing with them, they had to take NBC&#x27;s considerations into account in case they lost the commission; they rewrote Monica&#x27;s lines to show that she cared about Paul. NBC also wanted a scene removed that implied the supposedly-impotent Paul was getting an erection, as it would violate network standards. Crane and Kauffman rewrote the scene and found they preferred the new version, as it made the scene &quot;smart and subtler&quot;. They sought to protect other parts of the script, some major and some minor; NBC wanted two of the pilot&#x27;s three storylines downplayed to subplots, but the writers were adamant that all three should carry equal weight. They also favored not cutting the &quot;Mr. Potato Head&quot; line. Their final script draft was completed on May 3.

The episode was taped on May 4 at Warner Bros.&#x27; studios in Burbank, California. A total of eight hours of material was filmed (two hours from each of the four cameras), which was edited down to 22 minutes under Bright&#x27;s supervision. Bright submitted it to NBC on May 10, 72 hours before the fall schedule was announced. NBC ordered Bright to make further edits, which he completed at 1Â a.m. on May 11. On May 12, NBC screened the finished pilot to focus groups, who gave positive but mixed reactions. The network announced the fall schedule on May 13 and ordered an additional 12 episodes of &quot;Friends&quot; for its first season. Crane and Kauffman immediately received telephone calls from writers&#x27; agents who wanted to get their clients jobs on the series.

== Reception ==
The episode was first broadcast on NBC on September 22, 1994, in the 8:30â9Â p.m. (EST) timeslot. It ranked as the fifteenth-most-watched television show of the week, scoring 14.7/23 Nielsen rating (each point represented 954,000 households) and nearly 22Â  million viewers.

Critics likened the episode to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Ellen&quot;; Tom Feran in &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; wrote that it traded &quot;vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;&quot;, and Ann Hodges of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;the new &quot;Seinfeld&quot; wannabe, but it will never be as funny as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Even as &quot;Seinfeld&quot; is now, which isn&#x27;t as funny as it used to be&quot;. Hodges criticized the &quot;stiflingly dull social circle&quot; as &quot;short to the point of painful in brainpower&quot;. Robert Bianco in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote that the &quot;constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life&quot;, and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a &quot;likable, youth ensemble&quot; with &quot;good chemistry&quot;. He added that while &quot;Friends&quot; was &quot;one of the brighter comedies of the new season&quot;, the pilot was &quot;very weak&quot;. Diane Holloway for the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; questioned &quot;Friends&quot;â³ billing as a &quot;sophisticated comedy&quot;, writing, &quot;What&#x27;s sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?&quot; She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul&#x27;s impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. Robert P. Laurence wrote in &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; that &quot;A lot happens, but you&#x27;ll still get the feeling you&#x27;ve seen &quot;Friends&quot; before&quot;, calling it &quot;&quot;Seinfeld&quot; Plus Two. Or &quot;Ellen&quot; Plus Five.&quot; In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote &quot;The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend&quot; but that Joey and Rachel&#x27;s characteristics were under-developed.

&quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;flat-out the best comedy series of the new season&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;â³s Tony Scott had optimistic hopes for the series; he enjoyed the premise but was concerned that dialogue from the writers of &quot;Dream On&quot; should be &quot;snappier&quot;. Scott was also concerned that the Monica storyline set a bad example for younger viewers; &quot;&quot;Friends&quot; touts promiscuity and offers liberal samples of an openness that borders on empty-headedness&quot;. He singled out Cox and Schwimmer as the best actors of the ensemble. Robert Bianco was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him &quot;terrific&quot;. He also praised the female leads, but wrote that Perry&#x27;s role as Chandler was &quot;undefined&quot; and that LeBlanc was &quot;relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rates the episode B+ and states that &quot;After 22 minutes, these six people are believably set up as lifelong buddies&quot;. Ross&#x27;s line, &quot;Do the words &#x27;Billy, Don&#x27;t Be a Hero&#x27; mean anything to you?&quot; is singled out as the best line of the episode. The authors of &quot;Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends&quot; call it a &quot;good, solid start to the series&quot; but &quot;the regular cast (particularly Perry and Schwimmer) might be trying just a little too hard&quot;. Schwimmer recalls enjoying the physical humor involving Ross, particularly the scene where Ross greets Rachel and opens an umbrella on her.

The episode was syndicated for the first time on September 21, 1998. Several deleted scenes were restored to the episode, bringing its total running time to 37 minutes, for a one-hour timeslot. It gained a rating of 5.8/10, averaged across 40 stations. This made &quot;Friends&quot; the third-highest-rated off-network syndicated sitcom to air at that time, behind &quot;Home Improvement&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

<text>Robert Johns Bulkley (October 8, 1880July 21, 1965) was an American attorney and politician from Ohio. A Democrat, he served in the United States House of Representatives, and in the United States Senate from 1930 until 1939.

==Life and career==
Bulkley was born to a wealthy family in Cleveland, Ohio in 1880. He attended the private University School before graduating from Harvard College and law school. He commenced the practice of law in Cleveland, Ohio in 1906. Bulkley served two terms in the House from 1911-1915 from the 21st District on Cleveland&#x27;s East Side. During World War I, he served as chief of the legal section of the War Industries Board. He was later elected to the U.S. Senate in 1930 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Theodore E. Burton. Bulkley was re-elected in 1932, yet he lost a bid for a second full term in 1938 to Robert A. Taft. After his term in the Senate ended, he resumed his practice of law.

While a member of the House of Representatives, Bulkley became an expert on banking. He helped frame the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and the Federal Farm Loan Act, which would not pass until 1916.

Bulkley knew Franklin D. Roosevelt from their college days when they worked together on the &quot;Harvard Crimson.&quot; student newspaper. Senator Bulkley praised President Roosevelt and most of the New Deal, and he doled out a great deal of federal patronage. He was a moderate: midway between the liberals and the conservatives. He voted against key New Deal laws such the National Industrial Recovery Act, Tennessee Valley Authority, Agricultural Adjustment Act, Works Progress Administration, soil conservation, and against the wages and hours legislation. Nevertheless, when Roosevelt was trying to purge the Democratic conservatives in 1938, he went to Ohio to praise and endorse Bulkley. The decisive factor for Roosevelt was that Bulkey had voted YEA on the two critical 1937 bills for court-packing and for executive reorganization.

The Bulkley Building located in Playhouse Square in downtown Cleveland, Ohio is named after him.

Bulkley was married February 17, 1909 to Katherine Pope of Helena, Montana.

<text>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is a U.S. National Lakeshore in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, United States. It extends for along the shore of Lake Superior and covers . The park has extensive views of the hilly shoreline between Munising and Grand Marais in Alger County, with picturesque rock formations, waterfalls, and sand dunes.

Pictured Rocks derives its name from the 13 miles (24Â  km) of colorful sandstone cliffs northeast of Munising. The cliffs reach up to 200 feet (60 m) above lake level. They have been naturally sculptured into a variety of shallow caves, arches, and formations resembling castle turrets and human profiles. Near Munising, visitors can also visit Grand Island, most of which are included in the separate Grand Island National Recreation Area.

The U.S. Congress designated Pictured Rocks the first National Lakeshore in the United States in 1966. It is governed by the National Park Service (NPS), with 22 year-round NPS employees as of May 2006, and received 1,313,179 visitors in 2021.

== Geology ==
The colors in the cliffs are created by the large amounts of minerals in the rock. The cliffs are composed of the Munising Formation of 500-million-year-old Cambrian Period sandstone. The Munising Formation sits atop Precambrian sandstone of the Jacobsville Formation. The mottled red Jacobsville Formation is the oldest rock in the park. On top of the Munising Formation, acting as a cap over the other layers is the hard sandstone of the younger Au Train Formation from the Ordovician Period. Streaks on the face of the cliffs come from groundwater leaching out of the rock and evaporating, leaving streaks of iron (red), manganese (black-white), limonite (yellow-brown), copper (pink-green), and other minerals.
== History ==
Although the Pictured Rocks shore waters are a rich fishing ground, the sandstone cliffs are dangerous to canoes and other open boats skirting the coastline. In 1658, the fur trader Pierre Esprit Radisson made this risky passage and noted that his Native American companions made an offering of tobacco to the local spirit of the cliffs.

During the Romantic Era of the 1800s, a series of American writers described their feelings upon sight of the Pictured Rocks. Geologist and US Indian Agent Henry Rowe Schoolcraft visited in 1820 and remarked upon &quot;some of the most sublime and commanding views in nature&quot;. In 1850, George Copway &quot;Kah-Ge-Ga-Gah-Bow&quot;, a Mississaugas Ojibwe writer and Methodist missionary, published &quot;The Traditional History and Characteristic Sketches of the Ojibway Nation&quot;, in which he cited the detailed description of the Pictured Rock by General Lewis Cass. Around 1850, developers planned a tourist resort, Grand Island City, adjacent to the Pictured Rocks near the current site of Munising.

After the lumbering era ended around 1910, much of the land making up the current National Lakeshore reverted to the state of Michigan for unpaid property taxes. Eager for federal help and recognition, the state cooperated with the federal government in the region&#x27;s redevelopment. In October 1966, Congress passed a bill authorizing the establishment of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore &quot; to preserve for the benefit, inspiration, education, recreational use, and enjoyment of the public, a significant portion of the diminishing shoreline of the United States and its related geographic and scientific features.&quot; This was America&#x27;s first National Lakeshore.

On April 13, 2006, one of the named rock formations collapsed: the Inner Turret of Miner&#x27;s Castle in the Munising Formation. The collapse was reported via cell phone by fishermen in the area, according to chief ranger Larry Hach. Miners Castle consists of crumbly cross-bedded sandstone poorly cemented by secondary quartz, according to Research Ecologist Walter Loope of the U.S. Geological Survey. Rockfalls along the cliffs typically occur in the spring and fall due to freezing-thawing action.

On March 30, 2009, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act was signed into law, protecting of Pictured Rocks as the Beaver Basin Wilderness, spanning the 13 miles of shoreline.

==Representation in other media==
In 2010, singer Kid Rock filmed the video for his song &quot;Born Free&quot; at the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.

In early 2014, Courtney Kotewa&#x27;s snapshot of kayakers passing under a rock arch at the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore was chosen as the grand prize winner of the 2013 Share the Experience photo contest, sponsored by the National Park Foundation.

==Access and accessibility==

Munising, on the western end of the lakeshore, is accessed by M-28 and M-94. Grand Marais, on the eastern end, is reached by M-77.

Paved highways penetrate the Lakeshore from both ends, connected by County Road H-58. Roads come close to the shoreline only near Miners Castle, 12 Mile Beach, and the Grand Sable Dunes. The rest of the shoreline is seen from land only by hiking. A 42-mile (67-km) section of the North Country Trail spans the lakeshore. A permit is needed for backcountry camping, which is allowed along many miles of the National Lakeshore. This means that dispersed camping is not allowed in the park.

Many boat companies offer daily trips along the lakeshore from Memorial Day weekend through the fall season. Sea kayaking is another popular way to explore the park. While this may be the best way to see the natural formations, it is a strenuous trip in cold, dangerous water, not to be undertaken lightly or without proper equipment. Guides are available. The most efficient port of entry for kayaks is from Miner&#x27;s Beach or the harbor at Munising. In addition, pontoons can be cheaply rented locally.

Winter sports activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, ice climbing, and ice fishing.

The administrators of Pictured Rocks have worked to make much of its rugged environment wheelchair accessible. Features include:

* Interagency Visitor Center, Munising Falls Interpretive Center, and Miners Castle Information Station in Munising
* Grand Sable Visitor Center in Grand Marais
* Each drive-in campground has at least one handicapped-accessible campsite with an extended picnic table, boardwalk, pedestal fire grate, and nearby restroom
* Log Slide overlook
* Miners Castle overlooks (except lower overlook trail, which includes stairs and is steep)
* Munising Falls viewing platform, with a paved trail
* Boardwalk at Sand Point Marsh Trail, with large-print guide
* Sand Point Beach parking with paved sidewalks, fully accessible picnic site, and boardwalk toward Lake Superior

===Waterfalls===
Pictured Rocks is the site of many of Michigan&#x27;s waterfalls. Most of the waterfalls resulted from water running over the cliffs of the Munising Formation. This lime and sandstone formation exists between Tahquamenon Falls, some east, to Laughing Whitefish Falls, west of the Lakeshore. Pets are not allowed on most of the trails.

* &quot;Munising Falls&quot;âA waterfall over a sandstone cliff. Along the trail may be seen ferns, wildflowers, and an occasional mink. The trail is fully accessible to people with disabilities and dogs are allowed.
* &quot;Miners Falls&quot;âThis self-guiding interpretive trail passes Miners Basin and ends at Miners Falls. There are 77 steps leading down to the viewing platform. The falls drops over the sandstone outcrop.
* &quot;Bridalveil Falls&quot;âBridalveil is a seasonal waterfall. In the summer, it may not exist or be only a trickle. 
* &quot;Mosquito Falls&quot;âThis falls drops over an rock shelf on the Mosquito River. River otters and beavers live in the stream along the trail.
* &quot;Chapel Falls&quot;âTwo viewing platforms along the way provide views of the scenic Chapel Basin. Chapel Falls cascades some down the sandstone cliffs on its way to Chapel Lake.
* &quot;Spray Falls&quot;âThis waterfall is best seen from Lake Superior. The 1856 shipwreck of the &quot;Superior&quot; is at the base of the falls in of water.
* &quot;Sable Falls&quot; - Sable Falls tumbles over several cliffs of Munising and Jacobsville sandstone formations on its way to Lake Superior.

===Grand Sable Dunes===
The Grand Sable Dunes, at the eastern end of the Lakeshore, are a perched dune formation. Sand washed ashore by wave action was then blown upslope by northerly prevailing winds until it came to rest atop a glacial moraine. The Grand Sable Dunes today form a five-mile-long sand slope that rises from Lake Superior at a 35Â° angle. The summits of the tallest dunes are as high as 275 feet (85 m) above lake level.

Glacial melt during the last major advance/retreat called the Marquette Readvance created the conditions for the formation of the Grand Sable Banks. Dominant northwesterly winds eventually caused blowing sand to become perched on the banks. Today, the Grand Sable Banks rise to heights of up to 300Â ft. at a 35-degree angle from the shore of Lake Superior. The Grand Sable Dunes perched on top of these banks offers a desolate sandscape with jack pine forest near the edges.

In the late 19th century, loggers in the area built a wooden log slide from the top of the dunes at the Grand Sable Banks to Lake Superior below to facilitate the transportation of timber from the area. The location is a popular spot to view the Grand Banks and climb on the dunes. Visitors may also take a trail from the Grand Sable Visitors Center near the eastern end of the dunes or stop along a section of the dunes that border on Grand Sable Lake.
== Recreational activities ==
Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore offers a variety of recreational opportunities for visitors year-round, including hiking, back-country camping, kayaking, boating, swimming, scuba diving, fishing, and winter activities including snowmobiling, ice climbing, and cross-country skiing. The beautiful scenery, and variety of opportunities to enjoy the park attract significant visitors, including a record 800,000 in 2018.

=== Boating and kayaking ===

The colored rock formations attract kayakers and boat tours during the summer, as visitors flock to see the varied rock formations and colored rocks. Due to the danger of kayaking on the water near the cliffs, specialized equipment for sea-kayaking and knowledge are required to safely paddle near the cliffs.

=== Scuba diving ===
Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is a popular scuba diving destination in the Midwest and country, as the turbulent waters of Lake Superior have created many shipwrecks to explore over the years. A popular destination is the Alger Underwater Preserve.

=== Winter sports ===

Due to the lake-effect snow, Pictured Rocks and the Munising area have some of the highest snowfall across the country. This snowfall creates the perfect opportunity for snowmobilers, with dedicated snowmobile and cross-country ski trails in the park. Additionally, the long winter and constant runoff from snowmelt create one of the best ice-climbing opportunities in the country, with over 50 named ice formations. Ice climbing in Michigan attracts climbers from across the Midwest, the country, and even internationally. Additionally, the ice formations attract visitors to sightsee and explore the interesting ice features.

<doc id="712723" wikidata="Q1163923" url="?curid=712723" title="Ductus arteriosus">
<text>The ductus arteriosus, also called the ductus Botalli, named after the Italian physiologist Leonardo Botallo, is a blood vessel in the developing fetus connecting the trunk of the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. It allows most of the blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetus&#x27;s fluid-filled non-functioning lungs. Upon closure at birth, it becomes the ligamentum arteriosum.

==Development and structure==
The ductus arteriosus is formed from the left 6th aortic arches during embryonic development and attaches to the final part of the aortic arch (the isthmus of aorta) and the first part of the pulmonary artery.

==Disorder: patent ductus arteriosus==

===Consequences===
Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth results in a condition called patent ductus arteriosus, which results in the abnormal flow of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery: a left-to-right shunt. If left uncorrected, this usually leads to pulmonary hypertension followed by right ventricular heart failure, as well as possible cardiac arrhythmias.

===Role of prostaglandins===
The &quot;E&quot; series of prostaglandins are responsible for maintaining the openness of the ductus arteriosus (by dilation of vascular smooth muscle) throughout the fetal period. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced by both the placenta and the DA itself, is the most potent of the E prostaglandins, but prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) also has a role in keeping the &quot;DA&quot; open. PGE1 and PGE2 keep the ductus arteriosus open via involvement of specific PGE-sensitive receptors (such as EP4 and EP2). EP4 is the major receptor associated with PGE2-induced dilation of the DA and can be found across the DA in smooth muscle cells. 
Immediately after birth, the levels of both PGE2 and the EP4 receptors reduce significantly, allowing for closure of the DA and establishment of normal postnatal circulation.

===Role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs===
Ductus arteriosus closure may be induced by administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit prostaglandin production. The most common NSAID used is Indomethacin, which is usually administered in the first week after birth. However, in the presence of a congenital defect with impaired lung perfusion (e.g. Pulmonary stenosis and left-to-right shunt through the ductus), it may be advisable to improve oxygenation by maintaining the ductus open with prostaglandin treatment. However, such treatments are ineffective in an abnormal ductus. Persistence of the ductus may be associated with other abnormalities, and is much more common in females. By inhibiting PGE2 formation, EP4 receptor activation will decrease and normal circulation can begin. NSAIDs taken late in pregnancy can cross the placenta and lead to premature closure of the DA in the fetus. In this case, exogenous PDE2 can be administered to reverse the effects of the NSAIDs and maintain the patency of the DA for the remainder of the pregnancy.

===Incidence===
A patent ductus arteriosus affects approximately 4% of infants with Down syndrome (DS). A failure to thrive is a very common sign of this condition.

===Maintaining patency===
In some types of congenital heart defect (e.g., transposition of the great arteries), prostaglandins may be administered to maintain the DA open, allowing for the continual circulation and oxygenation of blood, until surgery can be performed.

== Other animals ==
Ductus arteriosus evolved with the lung in the ancestors of the lungfish as a connection between the pulmonary arteries and dorsal aorta. During embryonic development, reptiles, birds, and mammals all have either one or two paired ductus arteriosi that provide a fetal shunt of blood away from the lungs.

<text>A heliograph () is a solar telegraph system that signals by flashes of sunlight (generally using Morse code from the 1840s) reflected by a mirror. The flashes are produced by momentarily pivoting the mirror, or by interrupting the beam with a shutter. The heliograph was a simple but effective instrument for instantaneous optical communication over long distances during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its main uses were military, surveying and forest protection work. Heliographs were standard issue in the British and Royal Australian armies until the 1960s, and were used by the Pakistani army as late as 1975.

==Description==

There were many heliograph types. Most heliographs were variants of the British Army Mance Mark V version (Fig.1). It used a flat round mirror with a small unsilvered spot in the centre. The sender aligned the heliograph to the target by looking at the reflected target in the mirror and moving their head until the target was hidden by the unsilvered spot. Keeping their head still, they then adjusted the aiming rod so its cross wires bisected the target. They then turned up the sighting vane, which covered the cross wires with a diagram of a cross, and aligned the mirror with the tangent and elevation screws, so the small shadow that was the reflection of the unsilvered spot hole was on the cross target. This indicated that the sunbeam was pointing at the target.
The flashes were produced by a keying mechanism that tilted the mirror up a few degrees at the push of a lever at the back of the instrument. If the Sun was in front of the sender, its rays were reflected directly from this mirror to the receiving station. If the Sun was behind the sender, the sighting rod was replaced by a second mirror, to capture the sunlight from the main mirror and reflect it to the receiving station. The U.S. Army&#x27;s Signal Corps heliograph used a flat square mirror that did not tilt. This type produced flashes by a shutter mounted on a second tripod (Fig 4).

The heliograph had certain advantages. It allowed long-distance communication without a fixed infrastructure, though it could also be linked to make a fixed network extending for hundreds of miles, as in the fort-to-fort network used for the Geronimo military campaign. It was very portable, did not require any power source, and was relatively secure since it was invisible to those not near the axis of operation, and the beam was very narrow, spreading only per of range. However, anyone in the beam with the correct knowledge could intercept signals without being detected. In the Second Boer War (1899â1902) in South Africa, where both sides used heliographs, tubes were sometimes used to decrease the dispersion of the beam. In some other circumstances, though, a narrow beam made it difficult to stay aligned with a moving target, as when communicating from shore to a moving ship, so the British issued a dispersing lens to broaden the heliograph beam from its natural diameter of 0.5 degrees to 15 degrees.

The range of a heliograph depends on the opacity of the air and the effective collecting area of the mirrors. Heliograph mirrors ranged from or more. Stations at higher altitudes benefit from thinner, clearer air, and are required in any event for great ranges, to clear the curvature of the Earth. A good approximation for ranges of is that the flash of a circular mirror is visible to the naked eye at a distance of for each inch of mirror diameter, and farther apart seen with a telescope. The world record distance was established by a detachment of U.S. Army signal sergeants by the inter-operation of stations in North America on Mount Ellen, (Utah), and Mount Uncompahgre, (Colorado), apart on 17 September 1894, with Army Signal Corps heliographs carrying mirrors only .

==History==
The German professor Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777â1855), of the University of GÃ¶ttingen developed and used a predecessor of the heliograph (the heliotrope) in 1821. His device directed a controlled beam of sunlight to a distant station to be used as a marker for geodetic survey work, and was suggested as a means of telegraphic communications. This is the first reliably documented heliographic device, despite much speculation about possible ancient incidents of sun-flash signalling, and the documented existence of other forms of ancient optical telegraphy.

For example, one author in 1919 chose to &quot;hazard the theory&quot; that the Italian mainland signals from the capital of Rome that ancient Roman emperor Tiberius (42 B.C.-A.D.37, reigned A.D.14 to 37), watched for from his imperial retreat on the island of Capri. were mirror flashes, but admitted &quot;there are no references in ancient writings to the use of signaling by mirrors&quot;, and that the documented means of ancient long-range visual telecommunications was by beacon fires and beacon smoke, not mirrors.

Similarly, the story that a shield was used as a heliograph at the ancient famous Battle of Marathon between the Greeks and Persians in 490 B.C. is also unfortunately a modern myth, originating in the 1800s. The ancient historian Herodotus never mentioned any flash. What Herodotus did write was that someone was accused of having arranged to &quot;hold up a shield as a signal&quot;. Suspicion grew in the later 1900s, that the flash theory was implausible.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/625005&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion after testing the theory was &quot;Nobody flashed a shield at the Battle of Marathon&quot;.

In a letter dated 3 June 1778, John Norris, High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, England, notes: &quot;Did this day heliograph intelligence from Dr [Benjamin] Franklin in Paris to Wycombe&quot;. However, there is little evidence that &quot;heliograph&quot; here is other than a misspelling of &quot;holograph&quot;. The term &quot;heliograph&quot; for solar telegraphy did not enter the English language until the 1870sâeven the word &quot;telegraphy&quot; was not coined until the 1790s.

Henry Christopher Mance (1840â1926), of the British Government&#x27;s Persian Gulf Telegraph Department, developed the first widely accepted heliograph about 1869, while stationed at Karachi (now in modern Pakistan) in the then Bombay Presidency of British India. Mance was familiar with heliotropes by their use earlier for the mapping project of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (done 1802â1871). The Mance Heliograph was operated easily by one man, and since it weighed about , the operator could readily carry the device and its supporting tripod. The British Army tested the heliograph in India at a range of with favorable results. During the Jowaki Afridi expedition sent by the British-Indian government in 1877, the heliograph was first tested in war.
The simple and effective instrument that Mance invented was to be an important part of military communications for more than 60 years. The usefulness of heliographs was limited to daytimes with strong sunlight, but they were the most powerful type of visual signalling device known. In pre-radio times heliography was often the only means of communication that could span ranges of as much as with a lightweight portable instrument.

In the United States military, by mid-1878, a younger Colonel Nelson A. Miles had established a line of heliographs connecting far-flung military outposts of Fort Keogh and Fort Custer, in the northern Montana Territory, a distance of . In 1886, United States Army now General Nelson A. Miles (1839â1925), set up a network of 27 heliograph stations in the Arizona and New Mexico territories of the old Southwest during the extended campaign and hunt for the native Apache renegade chief / guerrilla warfare leader Geronimo (1829â1909). In 1890, now little-known Major W.J. Volkmar of the U.S. Army demonstrated in the Arizona and New Mexico territories, the possibility of performing communication by heliograph over a heliograph network aggregating in length. The network of communication begun by General Miles in 1886, and continued by unsung and now unfortunately relatively unknown Lieutenant W. A. Glassford, was perfected in 1889 at ranges of over a rugged and broken country, which was the stronghold of the Apache, Commanche and other hostile native Indian tribes.

By 1887, heliographs in use included not only the British Mance and Begbie heliographs, but also the American Grugan, Garner and Pursell heliographs. The Grugan and Pursell heliographs used shutters, and the others used movable mirrors operated by a finger key. The Mance, Grugan and Pursell heliographs used two tripods, and the others one. The signals could either be momentary flashes, or momentary obscurations. In 1888, the U.S. Army Signal Corps reviewed all of these devices, as well as the Finley Helio-Telegraph, and finding none completely suitable, developed its own instrument of the U.S. Army Signal Corps heliograph, a two-tripod, shutter-based machine of total weight, and ordered 100, for a total cost of $4,205. By 1893, the number of heliographs manufactured for the American Army Signal Corps was 133.

The heyday of the heliograph was probably the Second Boer War of the 1890s and early 1900s in South Africa, where it was much used by both the British and the native immigrant Boers. The terrain and climate, as well as the nature of the campaign, made heliography a logical choice. For night communications, the British used some large Aldis lamps, brought inland on railroad cars, and equipped with leaf-type shutters for keying a beam of light into dots and dashes. During the early stages of the war, the British Army garrisons were besieged in Kimberley, along with the sieges of Ladysmith, and at Mafeking. With land wire telegraph lines cut, the only contact with the outside world was via light-beam communication, helio by day, and Aldis lamps at night.

In 1909, the use of heliography for forestry protection was introduced by the United States Forestry Service in the western States. By 1920, such use was widespread in the US and beginning in the neighboring Dominion of Canada to the north, and the heliograph was regarded as &quot;next to the telephone, the most useful communication device that is at present available for forest-protection services&quot;. D.P. Godwin of the U.S. Forestry Service invented a very portable () heliograph of the single-tripod, shutter plus mirror type for forestry use.

Immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I (1914â1918), the mounted cavalry regiments of the Russian Imperial Army in the Russian Empire were still being trained in heliograph communications to augment the efficiency of their scouting and reporting roles. Following the two Russian Revolutions of 1917, the revolutionary Bolshevik / Communist units of their Red Army during the subsequent Russian Civil War of 1918â1922, made use of a series of heliograph stations to disseminate intelligence efficiently. This continued even a decade later about counter-revolutionary basmachi rebel movements in Central Asia&#x27;s Turkestan region in 1926.

During World War II (1939â1945), Union of South Africa and Royal Australian military forces used the heliograph while fighting enemy Nazi German and Fascist Italian forces along the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea in Libya and western Egypt with fellow defending British military in the desert North African campaign in 1940, 1941 and 1942.

The heliograph remained standard equipment for military signallers in the Royal Australian and British armies until the 1940s, where it was considered a &quot;low probability of intercept&quot; type of communication. The Canadian Army was the last major military force to have the heliograph as an issue item. By the time the mirror instruments were retired, they were seldom used for signalling. However, as recently as the 1980s, heliographs were used by insurgent Afghan mujahedeen forces during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1978â1979. Signal mirrors are still included in survival kits for emergency signaling to search and rescue aircraft.

==Automated heliographs==

Most heliographs of the 19th and 20th centuries were completely manual. The steps of aligning the heliograph on the target, co-aligning the reflected sunbeam with the heliograph, maintaining the sunbeam alignment as the sun moved, transcribing the message into flashes, modulating the sunbeam into those flashes, detecting the flashes at the receiving end, and transcribing the flashes into the message were all done manually. One notable exception â many French heliographs used clockwork heliostats to automatically steer out the sun&#x27;s motion. By 1884, all active units of the &quot;Mangin apparatus&quot; (a dual-mode French Army military field optical telegraph that could use either lantern or sunlight) were equipped with clockwork heliostats. The Mangin apparatus with heliostat was still in service in 1917. Proposals to automate both the modulation of the sunbeam (by clockwork) and the detection (by electrical selenium photodetectors, or photographic means) date back to at least 1882. In 1961, the United States Air Force was working on a space heliograph to signal between satellites

In May 2012, &quot;Solar Beacon&quot; robotic mirrors designed at the University of California at Berkeley were mounted on the twin towers of the Golden Gate Bridge at the entrance to San Francisco Bay, and a web site set up where the public could schedule times for the mirrors to signal with sun-flashes, entering the time and their latitude, longitude and altitude. The solar beacons were later moved to Sather Tower at the U.C. â Berkeley campus. By June 2012, the public could specify a &quot;custom show&quot; of up to 32 &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; periods of 4 seconds each, permitting the transmission of a few characters of Morse Code. The designer described the Solar Beacon as a &quot;heliostat&quot;, not a &quot;heliograph&quot;.

The first digitally controlled heliograph was designed and built in 2015. It was a semi-finalist in the Broadcom MASTERS competition.

<text>Ullevaal Stadion () is an all-seater football stadium located in Oslo, Norway. It is the home ground of the Norway national football team, and the site of the Norwegian Cup Final. From its opening in 1926 to 2009 it was the home ground of FK Lyn and from 1999 to 2017 was a home ground of VÃ¥lerenga IF. With a capacity of approximately 28,000, it is the largest football stadium in Norway. The national stadium is fully owned by the Football Association of Norway (NFF).

The stadium opened on 26 September 1926 as the home ground for Lyn and several other local teams. The first international match was played in 1927, and NFF started gradually purchasing part of the stadium company. The peak attendance dates from 1935, when 35,495 people saw Norway play Sweden. Since 1948, Ullevaal has hosted the finals of the Norwegian Football Cup, and in 1967 the Japp Stand was completed. A new renovation started with the completion of the single-tier West Stand in 1985, and continued with the two-tier North and East Stands in 1990 and the South Stand in 1998. Ullevaal hosted the finals of the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro in 1987 and 1997.

In conjunction with the stadium is the head office of many sports federations, a bandy field, and commercial property including a conference center, hotel and shopping mall. The stadium is located adjacent to UllevÃ¥l Stadion Station of the Oslo Metro and the Ring 3 motorway. Plans call to replace the West Stand to increase capacity to 30,000 and perhaps add a retractable roof and artificial turf.

== History ==
===Construction and early years===

The first suggestions for a stadium at Ullevaal were launched by members of Lyn in 1917, but not until 1924 was a committee appointed to look into the matter. Lyn had also considered building their stadium at HolmenkollÃ¥sen, Hoff, TÃ¥sen, Frogner, Berg and Marienlyst.

The club made an agreement with the tram operator Akersbanerne to purchase land they had acquired as part of the construction of the Sognsvann Line. It was decided that a limited company was to be established, with a share capital of NOKÂ 100,000. Aker Municipality agreed to purchase 30% and partially pay via access roads and utilities. All sports clubs in Aker were given the right to purchase up to 10% of the shares, whilst the rest was to be bought by Lyn. Any costs exceeding the capital was to be paid for through loans and donations. At the same time, Lyn acquired land to build a training field which they would own themselves and was estimated to cost NOKÂ 20,000. Both plans were passed by the club annual meeting on 23 May 1924.
A/S Ullevaal Stadion was founded on 27 January 1925. The company was owned 73.5% by Lyn, 24% Aker Municipality and 5.1% by the clubs Ullevaal, TÃ¥sen, Nydalen and Heming. The stadium was built with a running track, allowing the stadium to also be used for track and field, and had a capacity of about 35,000 spectators. The stadium cost NOKÂ 416,000. The grand opening was held on 26 September 1926 by Crown Prince Olav. It was followed by a friendly match between a reinforced Lyn and Ãrgryte IS of Sweden, where Lyn won 5â1. In the opening game, tickets cost NOKÂ 3 for seats, NOKÂ 2 for standing places and NOKÂ 1 on the end stands. The stadium became both the home ground for Lyn and hosted track and field events. The first international match was held on 29 May 1927 and featured Norway losing 0â1 against Denmark. The match against Sweden from the Nordic Football Championship 1933/36 on 22 September 1935 was held in front of a crowd of 35,495, which still stands as the spectator record. The stadium was served by the Oslo Metro with the opening of the Sognsvann Line in 1934. In 1938, a new East Stand (&quot;Klokkesvingen&quot;) was opened.
The Football Association bought Aker&#x27;s share of the stadium during the 1930s, and in 1945 also part of Lyn&#x27;s share. From 1948, the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal, and has been held there since. Other activities held during the first decades included boxing, and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40,000 people in 1955. In 1960, NFF bought more shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50.7%, while Lyn retained 44.2%. The reason was the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong tie to a single club, but the state was willing to give grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation. In 1967, a new South Stand was opened, and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium.

===Two-tier upgrades===
In the early 1980s, the owner company presented plans for an upgraded stadium, which would have capacity for 40,000 spectators, of which 25,000 would be seated and 15,000 would stand. In 1984, a new pitch was installed. The first renovation was an all-new West Stand, which would be single-tier and have capacity for 8,800 spectators, of which 3,800 could be seated under a roof. Costs were estimated at NOKÂ 56 million. The costs were covered by Sogn NÃ¦ringsbygg, who built the stands and then received free ground to build of commercial real estate. Because of the height, the new stand was met with protests from locals who felt the six-story structure would wreck the idyllic neighborhood. The stand was completed in 1985. On 14 June 1987, Ullevaal was the host of the final of the 1987 European Competition for Women&#x27;s Football, where Norway beat Sweden 2â0 in front of 8,408 spectators.

Plans for a new two-tier stand to the north and east were presented next. The plans had called for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater.
The renovations included a new turf with under-soil heating, luxury boxes, VIP-seating, a section for the royal family, new change rooms and of restaurant and meeting area. The upgrade involved the removal of the running track, making Ullevaal a pure football stadium.

Construction of the two stands started after the cup final in November 1989, and started with the demolishing of the north stand from 1926 and the east stand from 1938. After construction was completed, Lyn played its first home game on Ullevaal for the season on 13 September 1990, after having played most of the season in the Second Division at VoldslÃ¸kka Stadion. The construction included of commercial properties built beneath the stands. Total investment costs for the new stands and commercial area was NOKÂ 350 million, of which NOKÂ 100 million was for the stands. Plans for a NOKÂ 40-million underground squash court were discarded.

===NFF and Lyn dispute===
In 1993, Lyn was in deep financial difficulties after having been promoted to the Elite League after the 1991 season. To create additional liquidity, the club sold its 44% share in Ullevaal to the Football Association for NOKÂ 4.4 million in January 1993. At the same time, NFF bought the 5.1% stake owned by the other clubs, making NFF the sole owner of the stadium. In October, the limited company Lyn Fotball AS was founded to take over the elite football teams in Lyn. At the same time, the club announced that it planned to purchase back their shares in Ullevaal Stadion, by letting the club take up a loan.
In November, Lyn stated that they wanted to purchase the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who stated that they were now worth NOKÂ 10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium&#x27;s debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOKÂ 4.4 million plus interest.

In May, it was stated that the matter would not be handled in the courts, but instead by the Football Association&#x27;s Tribunal, with the possibility to appeal to the Norwegian Confederation of Sports&#x27; Tribunal. This was because FIFA&#x27;s regulations forbade a club form suing their own federation. In January 1995, the tribunal decided that Lyn had the right to purchase the shares for NOKÂ 4.4 million plus interest. By February, it became clear that Lyn did not have sufficient liquidity to purchase the shares. In December 1995, three months before the purchase option became invalid, the club bought back the shares. In 2001, it became clear that Lyn had given false information about the deal, and that the club had signed an agreement with Lyn Fotball AS which was later criticized by club members as a &quot;raid&quot; by the investors to secure the main asset in Lyn. The loan had a high interest rate and had clauses that made a refinancing expensive, it gave the investors a right of pre-emption for the shares, the right for the investors to terminate the load on short notice, and the right for the investors to take over the shares should the club not be able to manage the debt.

In February 1996, Lyn and NFF stated that they had agreed that Lyn would sell their shares in Ullevaal to NFF for about NOKÂ 5 to 6 million, plus support for Lyn&#x27;s new training facility at KringsjÃ¥. The parties stated that with the plans for expanding and making new investments in Ullevaal, Lyn&#x27;s lack of financial backing would become a hindrance for financing the projects and that the sale would allow Lyn to concentrate on playing football. On 25 March, NFF and Lyn stated the sale was terminated by NFF, because it was considered too lucrative for Lyn by other clubs in Norway. In 1996, the stadium featured a cross-country skiing event with 5,500 spectators. On 12 July 1997, Ullevaal was the host of the final of the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 1997, where Germany beat Italy 2â0 in front of 2,221 spectators.
In 1997, NFF and Lyn agreed to renovate and expand the stadium. The plans called for new stands which would increase the capacity to 30,000 spectators. The size of the field would be reduced by , from to to make the stadium more intimate. The new grass would be lowered , allowing two more rows of chairs to be added. The South Stand (Japp) would be demolished and a new two-tier stand would be built, in the same style as the northern and eastern stands. This would give three sides two-tier height, although the western stand would remain single-tier. The South Stand received 30 luxury boxes and press quarters for 192 people. The project involved the demolishing of the four light masts and instead installing the lights along the roof. The cost of the whole project was estimated at NOKÂ 300 million.

The project also included of commercial real estate, to be located behind the south stands. Because public grants of about NOKÂ 90 million could only be given to non-profit entities, the ownership of the stadium was split in two. The stands and other core areas of the stadium remained owned by the stadium company, while a separate company was created to own the commercial areas. NFF wanted the profits from the commercial company to go to the stadium company to pay for operating expenses, while Lyn wanted the profits to be paid as dividend to the owners so Lyn could pay interests on their debt. Construction started in January 1998, after Lyn had lost a court case regarding the dividend structure.

The Norwegian Olympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, including the federations for many smaller sports, chose to move to Ullevaal and establish their offices in conjunction with the stadium, in DrÃ¥pen located at the south side. The Norwegian Football Museum was established and received in the southern stand building.
During construction in 1998, Lyn and the national team played their games at Bislett Stadionâthe home venue for VÃ¥lerengaâwhile Ullevaal was being rebuilt. Prior to the 1999 season, where Lyn would have to play in the First Division, Lyn applied to play all their matches at Bislett to cut rental costs at Ullevaal. However, this was rejected by the municipality, who owned Bislett, because there was not vacant capacity at Bislett.

===VÃ¥lerenga enters===
In late 1998, VÃ¥lerenga considered moving their matches to Ullevaal from 1999. Although they stated that they had a better economic proposal from Ullevaal, the team stayed at Bislett to have more influence on the design of the new stadium that would replace the existing structure. Oslo&#x27;s other Premier League team, Skeid Fotball, stated that they had also considered playing at Ullevaal, but wanted to keep the more &quot;intimate feeling&quot; at VoldslÃ¸kka Stadion. However, VÃ¥lerenga were forced to move some of their 1999 matches to Ullevaal because the dilapidated standards at Bislett. Prior to the 2000 season, VÃ¥lerenga signed a three-year contract with Ullevaal, making the national stadium their home.

In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS bought the West Stand, including the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOKÂ 12.5 million, on the condition that if it was not paid back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn&#x27;s ownership in the stadium. This made it possible for Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre-emption. On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOKÂ 27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS and at the same time terminate Lyn&#x27;s debt. In exchange, Lyn&#x27;s ownership was reduced to 15%.
In 1998, Vital Forsikring bought the real estate located between the east of the stadium, Ring 3 and the Sognsvann Line. The lot covered , including the commercial properties under the stands. A new zoning plan was rejected by the municipality in 2000, but in 2005 the plans were passed. In 2008, Vital started constructing a hotel and more commercial spaces at the site. The hotel had 144 rooms and would be operated by Thon Hotel; other investments included a congress hall for 800 people and a reconstruction of the sports facility Bergbanen. Total area was , including for the congress center, for the four-story hotel, and a expansion of the shopping center by. The shopping center area thus became . The investments cost NOKÂ 550 million and were scheduled for completion in 2009. The project also included the bandy field Bergbanen and a new club building for UllevÃ¥l IL. Ownership of the bandy venue was transferred to the municipality.
On 23 October 2005, VÃ¥lerenga set its attendance record of 24,894 in a league match against Rosenborg BK.
 On 23 March 2007, NFF bought Lyn&#x27;s remaining 13.07% share of Ullevaal, securing the federation full control of the national stadium. Lyn was paid NOKÂ 32.5 million for the transaction. Following Lyn&#x27;s relegation from the Norwegian Premier League after the 2009 season, the club decided to move its home games from Ullevaal to Bislett. This was to avoid the high costs that the club had renting Ullevaal, which cost the club NOKÂ 150,000 per game, compared to a similar fee per season at Bislett. Lyn played its last home game at Ullevaal on 3 November, when it lost 0â5 against Fredrikstad FK. In the 2009 season of the Premier League, VÃ¥lerenga had the fourth-highest average attendance at 10,788, while Lyn had the lowest at 4,187. Lyn&#x27;s least-seen game attracted 2,092 people. After it was decided that the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was to be held at StabÃ¦k&#x27;s home venue Telenor Arena, StabÃ¦k was forced to rent Ullevaal to play three of its home games during April and May 2010. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players&#x27; Association among away-team captains, Ullevaal was found to be the league&#x27;s best stadium, with a score of 4,47 on a scale from one to five.

===VÃ¥lerenga leaves===
VÃ¥lerenga had long stated that they wanted to relocate and had conducted plans to build a new stadium at Valle Hovin, where the club currently have their administration and training facilities. Plans existed for stadiums for 22,000 spectators, which would be expandable to 32,000. Part of the rationale for their own stadium is that VÃ¥lerenga traditionally is the east side team, while Ullevaal is located in the heart of the west side. As an alternative, VÃ¥lerenga considered moving back to Bislett, at least as a temporary solution, though this did not occur. VÃ¥lerenga eventually ended up completing their plan and moved out mid-season to Intility Arena in September during the 2017 Eliteserien season, rendering the Norway men&#x27;s national football team and the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cup finals the only permanent tenants of Ullevaal.

In the 2024 Norwegian First Division, Ullevaal hosted its VÃ¥lerenga-Lyn men&#x27;s derby as the two teams were in the same division for the first time since Lyn&#x27;s 2009 relegation, despite both teams having moved out of Ullevaal for their regular matches and that the teams were now playing in tier 2. VÃ¥lerenga were playing in Eliteserien until being relegated after the 2023 season, whereas Lyn went bankrupt in late 2010 and were moved to tier 7 (6. divisjon) and worked their way up through the divisions.

==Transport==

The stadium is located next to the UllevÃ¥l stadion station of the Oslo Metro, and is served by lines 4 and 5 (the Sognsvann Line and the Ring Line). The stadium is also within a ten-minute walk from Rikshospitalet station of the Oslo Tramway, located on the UllevÃ¥l Hageby Line and served by trams 17 and 18. In addition, the motorway Ring 3 runs nearby. Parking is available at Rikshospitalet, Domus Atletica and Sogn Upper Secondary School; these are within a five minutes walk.

==Future==
In 2005, NFF launched plans for a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and allow more matches to be played, grant the teams more practice time on their home pitch, make room for sponsor events, allow more concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.
To make it easier to attract good international teams, the management of Ullevaal considered coordinating the laying of artificial turf with Parken Stadium in Copenhagen and RÃ¥sunda Fotbollstadion in Stockholm, the home of the Danish and Swedish national teams, respectively. Plans for artificial turf were rejected by both Lyn and VÃ¥lerenga, who both threatened to move elsewhere should the stadium install artificial turf. Commentators have stated that among older footballers there is opposition against artificial turf, but that long Norwegian winters cause pitches to be extremely bad during the early parts of the season. It has been argued that younger Norwegian players are used to artificial turf and that in the future they will need better pitches to play &quot;finer&quot; football. In 2010, seven of sixteen premiership stadiums used artificial turf; commentators have stated that if Ullevaal converted, it could be a pivoting point for other clubs to do the same.

NFF has launched plans for a new national football stadium. Inspired by the new Friends Arena to be built in Stockholm, a new venue would have a capacity for 52,000 spectators and was part of the joint NorwegianâSwedish bid for UEFA Euro 2016. To finance a new stadium, NFF would have to sell Ullevaal. NFF stated that expanding Ullevaal beyond 31,000 spectators would be excessively expensive and that the location poses limitations in transport infrastructure to handle so large crowds. In 2008, Ullevaal, including the of commercial area owned by NFF, was valued to about NOKÂ 1 billion, of which the commercial area was valuated at NOKÂ 750 million. In 2006, Ullevaal Stadion AS had NOKÂ 522 million in debt.

<doc id="712736" wikidata="Q195572" url="?curid=712736" title="Jason Lee (missionary)">
<text>Jason Lee (June 28, 1803 â March 12, 1845) was a Canadian Methodist Episcopalian missionary and pioneer in the Pacific Northwest. He was born on a farm near Stanstead, Quebec.

After a group of Nez Perce and Bitterroot Salish men journeyed to St. Louis requesting the Book of Heaven in 1831 (their people had heard of it years before), Lee and his nephew Daniel Lee volunteered to serve as missionaries for them. Both were appointed as missionaries by the church, given orders to open and maintain a mission among the Salish. At the time, the Pacific Northwest was &quot;jointly occupied&quot; by the United Kingdom and the United States as agreed to in the Treaty of 1818. The missionaries went overland in 1834 with Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, an American merchant who previously visited the Columbia River basin to enter the regional fur trade market. The party of priests and fur trappers arrived at Fort Vancouver later that year and were greeted by Chief Factor John McLoughlin. While there, McLoughlin influenced Jason Lee to open the station among the Kalapuya in the Willamette Valley rather than the Salish.

Jason Lee was the first of the Oregon missionaries and instrumental in the American settlement in the Oregon Country.

==Early life==
Jason Lee was the youngest of fourteen siblings. At the age of 13 Lee was self-supporting, converted to Methodism at 23 and later attended the Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy. While studying there, he became friends with Osman Baker and graduated in 1830. Between 1830 and 1832 he was minister in the Stanstead area and taught school. Lee had applied to the London-based Wesleyan Missionary Society to proselytize to the First Nations of Canada but his application wasn&#x27;t processed as Richard Watson, the secretary, had died.

==Missionary==
In 1832, four men of the Nez Perce and Bitterroot Salish or Flathead tribe journeyed to St. Louis and requested from resident William Clark for someone to bring the &quot;Book of Heaven&quot;, prophesied in a vision, to the Salish people. An account was editorialized by the &quot;Christian Advocate and Journal&quot; the subsequent year, calling upon its readers to send preachers to the Rocky Mountains and beyond. The article quickly was given the attention of Willbur Fisk, President of the Wesleyan University, who tabled a proposal for the Methodist Church to establish a presence among the Salish. Jason Lee, a former student of Fisk, and his nephew Daniel volunteered for service in the planned mission among the Flathead Indians.

Arrangements were made with Nathaniel Wyeth for the small missionary group to travel with his party. In early 1834 the combined group departed from Independence, Missouri. Lee didn&#x27;t refrain from judging and comparing the various native cultures along the Columbia River basin while en route west. He found the Walla Walla in particular &quot;far more filthy and indolent than the Kioos Cayuse.&quot; The close to two thousand mile trek ended at the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s (HBC) fur trading station of Fort Vancouver, where the missionaries wintered. During their stay there Chief Factor John McLoughlin advised against creating a mission in interior Flathead land and instead recommended the nearby Willamette Valley. Lee eventually settled on a location northwest of the present site of Salem, Oregon. There he found about a dozen French-Canadian settlers who previously had been employed by the HBC, in addition to their native wives and children.

===Conversion efforts===
Over time the superintendent began to request additional missionaries and laymen be sent to relieve him of temporal duties. This view was shared by Daniel Lee and later missionaries, all of whom complained of having to spend too much time away from conversion efforts. Additionally Lee downplayed the accounts from fellow priests by proclaiming that hundreds of natives had become Methodists. It wasn&#x27;t until the arrival of George Abernethy in 1840 that Lee was finally allowed to focus solely on proselyting to indigenous peoples.

Lee also highlighted that the indigenous populations were on the decline from disease in 1836: &quot;unless the God of heaven undertake their cause, they must perish from off the face of the Earth, and their name blotted out from under heaven.&quot; This became a typical view of Lee despite his continued conversion efforts. According to his biographer Cornelius J. Brosnan, Lee saw &quot;Oregon as the home of a future white civilization&quot; as early as 1837 while back in New York. In a letter addressed to the Methodist Missionary Board he beseeched for agriculturalists. Lee felt that because &quot;this country will settle ere long,&quot; if the board were to send &quot;a few good, pious settlers&quot; then &quot;an incalculable benefit&quot; would benefit &quot;generations yet unborn.&quot;

=== Marriage to Anna Maria Pittman ===
In the summer of 1837, missionary Anna Maria Pittman arrived at Lee&#x27;s mission to assist him. It had been suggested to Lee that he might marry Pittman, but at first he was not interested, finding her unattractive. After getting to know Pittman better, Lee changed his mind, writing, &quot;I at length became convinced that she was eminently qualified to do all the duties and kind offices of an affectionate companion, and was worthy of my highest regards, esteem, and love&quot;. Lee and Pittman were married on July 16, 1837.

==Political activities==
===Temperance efforts===
Lee formed the Oregon Temperance Society in 1836, composed of lay members of the Mission and former HBC employees. Blocked out of the local fur trade by the HBC, pioneer Ewing Young began plans to create an alcohol distillery for sale to natives. Once this became known to the Society its members were mobilized into action. In a letter signed by residents of the valley, Young was requested to refrain from opening the distillery and offered to cover the costs of forfeiting the venture. Young blamed the HBC for &quot;tyranizing oppression&quot; and the situation he was in but nonetheless agreed to forfeit production of alcohol without compensation.

===Willamette Cattle Company===
The first representative from the United States to visit the Methodist station was Navy Lieutenant William A. Slacum on board the &quot;Loriot&quot;. John McLoughlin welcomed the naval official and informed Jason Lee of his arrival, who met Slacum at Champoeg in January. A common topic Slacum had with French-Canadian and American settlers residing in the Willamette Valley was about livestock. All the cattle residing in Oregon at the time was then owned by the HBC. Despite this, McLoughlin authorized the loaning out of livestock as needed to missionaries and settlers. To resolve this pressing issue, Slacum suggested that cattle from Alta California be purchased. The Willamette Cattle Company was formed and the &quot;Loriot&quot; gave passage to Young and other men to California. Returning overland with a herd of 600 livestock, the portion for Lee and the Mission bestowed a sound means of nutritional self-sufficiency.

===Promoting a settler authority===
Ewing Young became the center of attention of the Willamette Valley farmsteads once again with his death and his extensive estate, which had no heirs to claim it in 1841. Several meetings were held and Lee chaired the first one where he put forth a proposal for a singular jurisdiction for all inhabitants south of the Columbia river. This was the culmination of feuds with Vicar General Blanchet who had till then dispensed justice on the Catholic population of the Willamette Valley. Blanchet was accused by Lee of splitting the settler community by refusing to submit to the attempted civic authority. This attempt was aimed at cutting the financially supportive relationship and patronage the HBC gave the Catholic Missionaries. By removing the political control over Catholics, the Company would lose influence among the settlers. An additional motive was that the Oregon Mission was in debt to the Company. These were the roots of Lee&#x27;s support for a government in 1841, rather than finding a local regime necessary in and of itself.

At the time of the Champoeg Meetings Lee was no longer an active participant of the political activities in the valley. By this point, according to Brosnan, &quot;Jason Lee&#x27;s political acumen made him realize that a local provisional government was not the direction where lay Oregon&#x27;s true interest.&quot; Abernethy joined Lee in criticizing the Champoeg Meetings and their developments as unnecessary.

==1838 trip east==
The delays in communication with the Board of Managers back in the United States eventually necessitated Lee to return there to give a more thorough description of the activities of the Mission. Prior to leaving he was influential in the propagation of a memorial by many residents of the Willamette Valley addressing the United States Congress. The document requested that the American government establish rule over the regions of the Oregon Country south of the Columbia River and highlighted the potentials of trade with Asia and the Pacific. Besides gathering funds for missionary work, Lee apparently left for the east as he had a &quot;desire to promote&quot; Oregon as a worthwhile place for colonization. Lee spent three weeks at the interior ABCFM missions run by Marcus Whitman and Henry H. Spalding while waiting for an escort from the HBC. Viewing the growing farms maintained by the Cayuse and Nez Perce, Jason considered them both &quot;superior to those upon the Willamette [River]Â ...&quot; despite the occasional whipping by the two missionaries. 

After giving birth to their child, Lee&#x27;s wife, Anna Maria Pittman Lee, died in June. The child, a boy, died a few days after birth. News of his wife and son&#x27;s deaths reached Lee more than two months later as he entered Missouri. Lee soon remarried to Lucy Thompson Grubbs.

While traveling through Illinois, Lee convinced John P. Richmond to join him in Oregon. Richmond was later appointed as the head of the Nisqually Mission in modern Washington. While in Peoria he held a speech on Oregon that enthralled some locals who formed the Peoria Party to attempt to colonize Oregon. At a meeting with the Missionary Board in November the Board approved his plan for the creation of recruiting laymen such as blacksmiths and mechanics, the creation of grist mill, and expansion of agricultural production. After the memorial arrived in Washington, D.C. it was presented to Congress by Senator Lewis F. Linn in JanuaryÂ 1839. In correspondence with Representative Caleb Cushing Lee noted that if America were to control the area many of the laymen of the Mission would in time become permanent settlers, which did eventually occur as predicted. During his time in the United States Lee went on several speaking tours throughout the nation along with a visit to his hometown in Canada to raise funds for the mission. Despite his position that only two additional preachers were needed, the Board recruited five. Lee and the &quot;great reinforcement&quot; sailed aboard the Lausanne and arrived in Oregon on 1Â June 1840.

==Dismissal==
Letters were sent to the Board of Managers from Elijah White, John P. Richmond, and Gustavus Hines attacking the leadership of Lee for several years.
Conflict with White, who previously managed the mission financial records, had been a source of discontent for years. White was accused by Lee of having spent money at Fort Vancouver on the account of the mission. Rather than show his records, White left for the United States in 1841. While David Leslie gave the superintendent a positive appraisal, it wasn&#x27;t enough to counter the years of criticisms. Reports held Lee accountable for a general neglect and disinterest in converting Indigenous peoples. Additionally, Lee&#x27;s inability to provide a complete financial history of the Willamette Mission and its subsidiary stations proved to be too much for the Board. They appointed Rev. George Gray as the new superintendent and instructed him to dispose of the temporal properties of the Mission, including the grist mill and missions not actively used.

After hearing the news that he was ejected as the superintendent from Marcus Whitman, who had recently returned from the United States, Lee went to meet the Board in person to defend himself. Crossing Mexico and sailing up the Mississippi River, Lee reached New York City on 27 May 1844. He found the leadership debating over slavery, which soon led to a schism and the formation of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In the meantime, Lee went to Washington, D.C., and had conferences with both President John Tyler and Senator Thomas H. Benton to present the land claims of the Oregon Mission. When finally meeting with the Board leadership Lee was able to rectify his position, but he wasn&#x27;t reappointed as superintendent. He opted to raise money for the Oregon Institute, (now Willamette University), a school he helped organize. However, while visiting his sister in Stanstead, his health failed, and he died on 12Â March 1845. His remains were reinterred at the Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem, Oregon in 1906 alongside the remains of his two wives and infant daughter.

==Legacy==

The house Lee occupied in 1841 is preserved as part of the Willamette Heritage Center, formerly known as the Mission Mill Museum.

In 1953, the State of Oregon donated a bronze statue of Lee to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. Another copy was installed on the grounds of the Oregon State Capitol in 1953, having been finished by Gifford MacGregor Proctor after the death of his father, sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor.

Elementary schools in Richland, Washington, and Portland, Oregon and a middle school in Vancouver, Washington are named after him.

<doc id="712760" wikidata="Q9064643" url="?curid=712760" title="Trichoplax">
<text>Trichoplax adhaerens is one of the four named species in the phylum Placozoa. The others are &quot;Hoilungia hongkongensis&quot;, &quot;Polyplacotoma mediterranea&quot; and &quot;Cladtertia collaboinventa&quot;. Placozoa is a basal group of multicellular animals, possible relatives of Cnidaria. &quot;Trichoplax&quot; are very flat organisms commonly less than 4Â mm in diameter, lacking any organs or internal structures. They have two cellular layers: the top epitheloid layer is made of ciliated &quot;cover cells&quot; flattened toward the outside of the organism, and the bottom layer is made up of cylinder cells that possess cilia used in locomotion, and gland cells that lack cilia. Between these layers is the fibre syncytium, a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibres.

&quot;Trichoplax&quot; feed by absorbing food particlesâmainly microbesâwith their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though &quot;Trichoplax&quot; has a small genome in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 predicted protein-coding genes are identifiably similar to known genes in other animals.

==Discovery==
&quot;Trichoplax&quot; was discovered in 1883 by the German zoologist Franz Eilhard Schulze, in a seawater aquarium at the Zoological Institute in Graz, Austria. The generic name is derived from the classical Greek (&#x27;), &quot;hair&quot;, and (&#x27;), &quot;plate&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;adhaerens&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;adherent&quot;, reflecting its propensity to stick to the glass slides and pipettes used in its examination.

Although from the very beginning most researchers who studied &quot;Trichoplax&quot; in any detail realized that it had no close relationship to other animal phyla, the zoologist Thilo Krumbach published a hypothesis that &quot;Trichoplax&quot; is a form of the planula larva of the anemone-like hydrozoan &quot;Eleutheria krohni&quot; in 1907. Although this was refuted in print by Schulze and others, Krumbach&#x27;s analysis became the standard textbook explanation, and nothing was printed in zoological journals about &quot;Trichoplax&quot; until the 1960s. In the 1960s and 1970s a new interest among researchers led to acceptance of Placozoa as a new animal phylum. Among the new discoveries was study of the early phases of the animals&#x27; embryonic development and evidence that the animals that people had been studying are adults, not larvae. This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature (as opposed to aquariums).

==Morphology==

&quot;Trichoplax&quot; generally has a thinly flattened, plate-like body in cross-section around half a millimetre, occasionally up to two or three millimetres. The body is usually only about 25Â Î¼m thick. Because they are so thin and fragile, and because the cilia which they use for locomotion are only loosely coordinated, they are constantly being split into two or three separate clones when their cilia moves in opposite directions, causing microfractures in the animalâs epithelium. One hypothesis is that the larger a motile animal lacking a nervous system is, the less coordinated its locomotion becomes, placing an upper limit on their possible size. These colorlessly gray organisms are so thin they are transparent when illuminated from behind, and in most cases are barely visible to the naked eye. Like the single-celled amoebae, which they superficially resemble, they continually change their external shape. In addition, spherical phases occasionally form. These may facilitate movement to new habitats.
&quot;Trichoplax&quot; lacks tissues and organs; there is also no manifest body symmetry, so it is not possible to distinguish anterior from posterior or left from right. It is made up of a few thousand cells of six types in three distinct layers: dorsal epithelia cells and ventral epithelia cells, each with a single cilium (&quot;monociliate&quot;), ventral gland cells, syncytial fiber cells, lipophils, and crystal cells (each containing a birefringent crystal, arrayed around the rim). Lacking sensory and muscle cells, it moves using cilia on its external surface. The collective movements of the cilia are completely coordinated by mechanical interactions.

==Signal processing==
There are no neurons present, but in the absence of a nervous system the animal uses short chains of amino acids known as peptides for cell communication, in a manner resembling the way animals with neurons use neuropeptides for the same purpose. These specialized cells are called peptidergic cells, but unlike neurons they don&#x27;t use electrical impulses and their messaging is restricted to sending signals to other nearby cells only, as they&#x27;re unable to both send and receive signals. Individual cells contain and secrete a variety of small peptides, made up of between four and 20 amino acids, which are detected by neighbouring cells. Each peptide can be used individually to send a signal to other cells, but also sequentially or together in different combinations, creating a huge number a different types of signals. This allows for a relatively complex behavioural repertoire, including behaviours such as &quot;crinkling&quot;, turning, flattening, and internal &quot;churning&quot;. The genome of Trichoplax codes for eighty-five neurotransmitter receptors, more than in any other sequenced animal.

==Epitheloid==
Both structurally and functionally, it is possible to distinguish a back or dorsal side from a belly or ventral side in &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;. Both consist of a single layer of cells coated on the outside with slime and are reminiscent of epithelial tissue, primarily due to the junctionsâbelt desmosomesâbetween the cells. In contrast to true epithelium, however, the cell layers of the Placozoa possess no &quot;basal lamina&quot;, which refers to a thin layer of extracellular material underlying epithelium that stiffens it and separates it from the body&#x27;s interior. The absence of this structure, which is otherwise to be found in all animals except the sponges, can be explained in terms of function: a rigid separating layer would make the amoeboid changes in the shape of &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; impossible. Instead of an epithelium, therefore, we speak of an &quot;epitheloid&quot; in the Placozoa.

A mature individual consists of up to a thousand cells that can be divided into four different cell types. The monociliated cells of the dorsal epitheloid are flattened and contain lipid bodies. The cells on the ventral side likewise possess a single cilium, while their elongated columnar shape, with a small cross section at the surface, packs them very closely together, causing the cilia to be very closely spaced on the ventral side and to form a ciliated &quot;crawling sole&quot;. Interspersed among these ventral epithlioid cells are unciliated gland cells thought to be capable of synthesizing digestive enzymes.

==Fibre syncytium==
Between the two layers of cells is a liquid-filled interior space, which, except for the immediate zones of contact with the ventral and dorsal sides, is pervaded by a star-shaped fibre syncytium: a fibrous network that consists essentially of a single cell but contains numerous nuclei that, while separated by internal crosswalls (septa), do not have true cell membranes between them. Similar structures are also found in the sponges (Porifera) and many fungi.

On both sides of the septa are liquid-filled capsules that cause the septa to resemble synapses, i.e. nerve-cell junctions that occur in fully expressed form only in animals with tissues (Eumetazoa). Striking accumulations of calcium ions, which may have a function related to the propagation of stimuli, likewise suggest a possible role as &quot;protosynapses&quot;. This view is supported by the fact that fluorescent antibodies against cnidarian neurotransmitters, i.e. precisely those signal carriers that are transferred in synapses, bind in high concentrations in certain cells of &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;, and thus indicate the existence of comparable substances in the Placozoa. The fibre syncytium also contains molecules of actin and probably also of myosin, which occur in the muscle cells of eumetazoans . In the placozoans, they ensure that the individual fibres can relax or contract and thus help determine the animals&#x27; shape.

In this way, the fibre syncytium assumes the functions of nerve and muscle tissues. Moreover, at least a portion of digestion occurs here. On the other hand, no gelatinous extracellular matrix exists of the kind observed, in &quot;mesoglea&quot;, in cnidarians and ctenophores.

&quot;Pluripotent&quot; cells, which can differentiate into other cell types, have not yet been demonstrated unambiguously in &quot;T. adhaerens&quot;, in contrast to the case of the Eumetazoa. The conventional view is that dorsal and ventral epithelioid cells arise only from other cells of the same type.

==Genetics==
The &quot;Trichoplax&quot; genome contains about 98 million base pairs and 11,514 predicted protein-coding genes.

All nuclei of placozoan cells contain six pairs of chromosomes that are only about two to three micrometres in size. Three pairs are &quot;metacentric&quot;, meaning that the centromere, the attachment point for the spindle fibers in cell division, is located at the center, or &quot;acrocentric&quot;, with the centromere at an extreme end of each chromosome. The cells of the fiber syncytium can be &quot;tetraploid&quot;, i.e. contain a quadruple complement of chromosomes.

A single complement of chromosomes in &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; contains a total of fewer than fifty million base pairs and thus forms the smallest animal genome; the number of base pairs in the intestinal bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is smaller by a factor of only ten.

The genetic complement of &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; has not yet been very well researched; it has, however, already been possible to identify several genes, such as &quot;Brachyury&quot; and &quot;TBX2/TBX3&quot;, which are homologous to corresponding base-pair sequences in eumetazoans. Of particular significance is &quot;Trox-2&quot;, a placozoan gene known under the name &quot;Cnox-2&quot; in cnidarians and as &quot;Gsx&quot; in the bilaterally symmetrical Bilateria. As a homeobox or Hox gene it plays a role in organization and differentiation along the axis of symmetry in the embryonic development of eumetazoans; in cnidarians, it appears to determine the position of mouth-facing (oral) and opposite-facing (aboral) sides of the organism. Since placozoans possess no axes of symmetry, exactly where the gene is transcribed in the body of &quot;Trichoplax&quot; is of special interest. Antibody studies have been able to show that the gene&#x27;s product occurs only in the transition zones of the dorsal and ventral sides, perhaps in a fifth cell type that has not yet been characterized. It is not yet clear whether these cells, contrary to traditional views, are stem cells, which play a role in cell differentiation. In any case, &quot;Trox-2&quot; can be considered a possible candidate for a proto-Hox gene, from which the other genes in this important family could have arisen through gene duplication and variation.

Initially, molecular-biology methods were applied unsuccessfully to test the various theories regarding Placozoa&#x27;s position in the Metazoa system. No clarification was achieved with standard markers such as 18S rDNA/RNA: the marker sequence was apparently &quot;garbled&quot;, i.e. rendered uninformative as the result of many mutations. Nevertheless, this negative result supported the suspicion that &quot;Trichoplax&quot; might represent an extremely primitive lineage of metazoans, since a very long period of time had to be assumed for the accumulation of so many mutations.

Of the 11,514 genes identified in the six chromosomes of &quot;Trichoplax&quot;, 87% are identifiably similar to genes in cnidarians and bilaterians. In those &quot;Trichoplax&quot; genes for which equivalent genes can be identified in the human genome, over 80% of the introns (the regions within genes that are removed from RNA molecules before their sequences are translated in protein synthesis) are found in the same location as in the corresponding human genes. The arrangement of genes in groups on chromosomes is also conserved between the &quot;Trichoplax&quot; and human genomes. This contrasts to other model systems such as fruit flies and soil nematodes that have experienced a paring down of non-coding regions and a loss of the ancestral genome organizations.

==Relationship with animals==
The phylogenetic relationship between &quot;Trichoplax&quot; and other animals has been debated for some time. A variety of hypotheses have been advanced based on the few morphological characteristics of this simple organism that could be identified. More recently, a comparison of the &quot;Trichoplax&quot; mitochondrial genome suggested that &quot;Trichoplax&quot; is a basal metazoanâless closely related to all other animals including sponges than they are to each other. This implies that the Placozoa would have arisen relatively soon after the evolutionary transition from unicellular to multicellular forms. But an even more recent analysis of the much larger &quot;Trichoplax&quot; nuclear genome instead supports the hypothesis that &quot;Trichoplax&quot; is a basal eumetazoan, that is, more closely related to Cnidaria and other animals than any of those animals are to sponges. This is consistent with the presence in &quot;Trichoplax&quot; of cell layers reminiscent of epithelial tissue (see above).

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Trichoplax&quot; was first discovered on the walls of a marine aquarium, and is rarely observed in its natural habitat.
&quot;Trichoplax&quot; has been collected, among other places, in the Red Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Caribbean, off Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, Japan, Vietnam, Brazil, and Papua New Guinea, and on the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast of Australia.

Field specimens tend to be found in the coastal tidal zones of tropical and subtropical seas, on such substrates as the trunks and roots of mangroves, shells of molluscs, fragments of stony corals or simply on pieces of rock. One study was able to detect seasonal population fluctuations, the causes of which have not yet been deduced.

==Feeding and symbionts==
&quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; feeds on small algae, particularly on green algae (Chlorophyta) of the genus &quot;Chlorella&quot;, cryptomonads (Cryptophyta) of the genera &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; and &quot;Rhodomonas&quot;, and blue-green bacteria (Cyanobacteria) such as &quot;Phormidium inundatum&quot;, but also on detritus from other organisms. In feeding, one or several small pockets form around particles of nutrients on the ventral side, into which digestive enzymes are released by the gland cells; the organisms thus develop a temporary &quot;external stomach&quot;, so to speak. The enclosed nutrients are then taken up by pinocytosis (&quot;cell-drinking&quot;) by the ciliated cells located on the ventral surface.

Entire single-celled organisms can also be ingested through the upper epitheloid (that is, the &quot;dorsal surface&quot; of the animal). This mode of feeding could be unique in the animal kingdom: the particles, collected in a slime layer, are drawn through the intercellular gaps (cellular interstices) of the epitheloid by the fibre cells and then digested by phagocytosis (&quot;cell-eating&quot;). Such &quot;collecting&quot; of nutrient particles through an intact tegument is only possible because some &quot;insulating&quot; elements (specifically, a basal lamina under the epitheloid and certain types of cell-cell junctions) are not present in the Placozoa.

When the concentrations of algae are high the animals are more likely to engage in social feeding behavior.

Not all bacteria in the interior of Placozoa are digested as food: in the endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle of the fibre syncytium, bacteria are frequently found that appear to live in symbiosis with &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot;. These endosymbionts, which are no longer able to survive outside its host, are transferred from one generation to the next through both vegetative and sexual reproduction.

==Locomotion==

Placozoa can move in two different ways on solid surfaces: first, their ciliated crawling sole lets them glide slowly across the substrate; second, they can change location by modifying their body shape, as an amoeba does. These movements are not centrally coordinated, since no muscle or nerve tissues exist. It can happen that an individual moves simultaneously in two different directions and consequently divides into two parts.

It has been possible to demonstrate a close connection between body shape and the speed of locomotion, which is also a function of available food:

* At low nutrient density, the spread-out area fluctuates slightly but irregularly; speed remains relatively constant at about 15 micrometres per second. 
* If nutrient density is high, however, the area covered oscillates with a stable period of about 8 minutes, in which the greatest extent reached by the organism can be as much as twice the smallest. Its speed, which remains consistently below 5 micrometres per second, varies with the same period. In this case, a high speed always corresponds to a reduced area, and vice versa.

Since the transition is not smooth but happens abruptly, the two modes of extension can be very clearly separated from one another. The following is a qualitative explanation of the animal&#x27;s behavior:

* At low nutrient density, &quot;Trichoplax&quot; maintains a constant speed in order to uncover food sources without wasting time.
* Once such a source is identified by high nutrient density, the organism increases its area in regular increments and thereby enlarges the surface in contact with substrate. This enlarges the surface through which nutrients can be ingested. The animal reduces its speed at the same time in order to actually consume all of the available food.
* Once this is nearly completed, &quot;Trichoplax&quot; reduces its area again to move on. Because food sources such as algal mats are often relatively extensive, it is reasonable for such an animal to stop moving after a brief period in order to flatten out again and absorb nutrients. Thus &quot;Trichoplax&quot; progresses relatively slowly in this phase.

The actual &quot;direction&quot; in which &quot;Trichoplax&quot; moves each time is random: if we measure how fast an individual animal moves away from an arbitrary starting point, we find a linear relationship between elapsed time and mean square distance between starting point and present location. Such a relationship is also characteristic of random Brownian motion of molecules, which thus can serve as a model for locomotion in the Placozoa.

Small animals are also capable of swimming actively with the aid of their cilia. As soon as they come into contact with a possible substrate, a &quot;dorsoventral response&quot; occurs: the dorsal cilia continue to beat, whereas the cilia of ventral cells stop their rhythmic beating. At the same time, the ventral surface tries to make contact with the substrate; small protrusions and invaginations, the &quot;microvilli&quot; found on the surface of the columnar cells, help in attaching to the substrate via their adhesive action.

Using &quot;T. adhaerens&quot; as a model, 0.02â0.002Â Hz oscillations in locomotory and feeding patterns were observed, and taken as evidence of complex multicellular integration, dependent on endogenous secretion of signal molecules. Evolutionarily conserved low-molecular-weight transmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine, GABA, and ATP) acted as coordinators of distinct locomotory and feeding patterns. Specifically, L-glutamate induced and partially mimicked endogenous feeding cycles, whereas glycine and GABA suppressed feeding. ATP-modified feeding is complex, first causing feeding-like cycles and then suppressing feeding. Trichoplax locomotion was modulated by glycine, GABA, and, surprisingly, by animalsâ own mucus trails. Mucus triples locomotory speed compared to clean substrates. Glycine and GABA increased the frequency of turns. 
==Regeneration==
A notable characteristic of the Placozoa is that they can regenerate themselves from extremely small groups of cells. Even when large portions of the organism are removed in the laboratory, a complete animal develops again from the remainder. It is also possible to rub &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; through a strainer in such a manner that individual cells are not destroyed but are separated from one another to a large extent. In the test tube they then find their way back together again to form complete organisms. If this procedure is performed on several previously strained individuals simultaneously, the same thing occurs. In this case, however, cells that previously belonged to a particular individual can suddenly show up as part of another.

==Reproduction==
The Placozoa normally propagate asexually, dividing down the middle to produce two (or sometimes, three) roughly equal-sized daughters. These remain loosely connected for a while after fission. More rarely, budding processes are observed: spherules of cells separate from the dorsal surface; each of these combines all known cell types and subsequently grows into an individual on its own.

Sexual reproduction is thought to be triggered by excessive population density. As a result, the animals absorb liquid, begin to swell, and separate from the substrate so that they float freely in the water. In the protected interior space, the ventral cells form an ovum surrounded by a special envelope, the fertilisation membrane; the ovum is supplied with nutrients by the surrounding syncytium, allowing energy-rich yolk to accumulate in its interior. Once maturation of the ovum is complete, the rest of the animal degenerates, liberating the ovum itself. Small, unciliated cells that form at the same time are interpreted to be spermatozoa. It has not yet been possible to observe fertilisation itself; the existence of the fertilisation membrane is currently taken to be evidence, however, that it has taken place.

Putative eggs have been observed, but they degrade, typically at the 32â64 cell stage. Neither embryonic development nor sperm have been observed. Despite lack of observation of sexual reproduction in the lab, the genetic structure of the populations in the wild is compatible with the sexual reproduction mode, at least for species of the analysed genotype H5.

Usually even before its liberation, the ovum initiates cleavage processes in which it becomes completely pinched through at the middle. A ball of cells characteristic of animals, the blastula, is ultimately produced in this manner, with a maximum of 256 cells. Development beyond this 256-cell stage has not yet been observed.

Trichoplax lack a homologue of the Boule protein that appears to be ubiquitous and conserved in males of all species of other animals tested. If its absence implies the species has no males, then perhaps its &quot;sexual&quot; reproduction may be a case of the above-described process of regeneration, combining cells from two separate organisms into one.

Due to the possibility of its cloning itself by asexual propagation without limit, the life span of Placozoa is infinite; in the laboratory, several lines descended from a single organism have been maintained in culture for an average of 20 years without the occurrence of sexual processes.

==Role as a model organism==
Long ignored as an exotic, marginal phenomenon, &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; is today viewed as a potential biological model organism. In particular, research is needed to determine how a group of cells that cannot be considered full-fledged epithelial tissue organizes itself, how locomotion and coordination occur in the absence of true muscle and nerve tissue, and how the absence of a concrete body axis affects the animal&#x27;s biology. At the genetic level, the way in which &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; protects against damage to its genome needs to be studied, particularly with regard to the existence of special DNA-repair processes. &quot;T. adhaerens&quot; can tolerate high levels of radiation damage that are lethal to other animals. Tolerance to X-ray exposure was found to depend on expression of genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis including the gene &quot;Mdm2&quot;. Complete decoding of the genome should also clarify the placozoans&#x27; place in evolution, which continues to be controversial.

Its ability to fight cancer through a combination of aggressive DNA repair and ejection of damaged cells makes it a promising organism for cancer research.

In addition to basic research, this animal could also be suitable for studying wound-healing and regeneration processes; as yet unidentified metabolic products should be researched. Finally, &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; is also being considered as an animal model for testing compounds and antibacterial drugs.

The related lineage &quot;Trichoplax&quot; sp. H2 has been suggested to be a more suitable model organism than &quot;T. adhaerens&quot;, due to its abundance and ease of culture.

==Systematics==
Francesco Saverio Monticelli described another species in 1893, which he found in the waters around Naples, naming it &quot;Treptoplax reptans&quot;. However, it has not been observed since 1896, and most zoologists today doubt its existence.

Significant genetic differences have been observed between collected specimens matching the morphological description of &quot;T. adhaerens&quot;, leading scientists to suggest in 2004 that it may be a cryptic species complex. At least twenty haplotypes have since been assigned based on the 16S mitochondrial DNA fragment, with &quot;T. adhaerens&quot; being equated to the lineage H1. While most haplotypes have not been formally described as species, they have been (with the exception of the morphologically distinct H0, &quot;Polyplacotoma mediterranea&quot;) provisionally placed into seven distinct clades. The genus &quot;Trichoplax&quot; was redefined as comprising clades I and II, including haplotypes H1, H2, H3 and H17. A later study defined &quot;Trichoplax&quot; more restrictively as only clade I (haplotypes H1, H2 and H17), with H3 being suggested to belong to a separate undescribed genus in the family Trichoplacidae.

Placozoan haplotypes are not necessarily equivalent to species, and several haplotypes of the related placozoan genus &quot;Hoilungia&quot; have been found to belong to the same species. Nonetheless, haplotype H2 is usually considered to be a separate undescribed species, referred to as &quot;Trichoplax&quot; sp. H2. It has been reported to be more robust and abundant than &quot;T. adhaerens&quot;, and easier to culture, making it a better fit for experimental research. &quot;Trichoplax&quot; sp. H2 is also distinguished by the presence of an additional cell type, termed &quot;epithelia upper-like&quot;, giving it a total of 29 cell types compared to the 28 in &quot;T. adhaerens&quot;.

Comparative genetic studies of &quot;Trichoplax adhaerens&quot; and the Panama strain of &quot;Trichoplax&quot; sp. H2 have suggested that their genetic similarity might be due to an interbreeding event having happened in the wild at least several decades ago, with one of them being the result of hybridization between the other and a third unknown strain. Analysis of bacterial endosymbionts supports this as a possible hypothesis, as the endosymbiont found in the Panama strain is closer to the one in &quot;T. adhaerens&quot; than to the one in the Hawaii strain of &quot;Trichoplax&quot; sp. H2.

<text>Theodore Elijah Burton (December 20, 1851October 28, 1929) was an American attorney and Republican politician from Ohio. He served in the United States House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, and the Cleveland City Council.

== Early years ==
Burton was born in Jefferson, Ashtabula County, Ohio, the son of Elizabeth (Grant) and The Rev. William Burton. He attended the public schools, Grand River Institute, Austinburg, Ohio, and Iowa College, Grinnell, Iowa. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1872. He studied law in Chicago with Lyman Trumbull, friend of Lincoln, and Senator of the United States for eighteen years. He commenced the practice of law in 1875, becoming a prominent attorney in Cleveland. His first public office was member of Cleveland City Council, serving from 1886 through 1888, after which time he was elected to the United States House of Representatives.

== Career ==

He was elected to the House of Representatives for the Fifty-first United States Congress in 1888 from the Ohio 21st District in Cleveland but was defeated for re-election in 1890 by his Democratic Party opponent, Tom L. Johnson. He was not the Republican nominee in 1892, but was nominated again in 1894 and won election to the Fifty-fourth United States Congress, this time defeating his erstwhile opponent and still incumbent, Tom L. Johnson. He was re-elected seven times, serving in the House until 1908.

He was noted for his work in preserving Niagara Falls and for opposing wasteful waterways projects. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed him chairman of the Inland Waterways Commission in 1907 and the National Waterways Commission in 1909. He also sponsored the legislation authorizing the construction of the Panama Canal.

He opposed wasteful spending in general, and despite his background as a corporate lawyer, he resisted the influence of big business. In his first term he co-sponsored the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.

After his re-election in 1908, he was elected to the Senate, and resigned his House seat. He served as Chairman of the Committee on Rivers and Harbors.

He did not seek a second Senate term. Instead, he moved to New York City, and worked in banking for several years.

In 1916, he was considered a possible candidate for president, and received 77Â½ votes on the first ballot (out of 987) at the Republican national convention.

In 1920, he returned to Ohio and was again elected to the House, this time from the 22nd District (borders having changed in 1912). He was re-elected to the House in 1922, 1924, and 1926.

During his later House service, he was appointed by President Harding to the World War Debt Funding Commission in 1922; and was chairman of the United States delegation to the conference for the control of international traffic in arms at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1925.

As president of the American Peace Society, Burton hosted the First World Conference on International Justice in Cleveland in 1928, attended by 13,000, including world leaders.

In 1928, he did not seek re-election to the House. Instead he won a special election to the Senate for the unfinished term of Frank B. Willis, who had died on March 30. He served in the Senate from December 15, 1928 until his death on October 28, 1929. Black Tuesday (the Wall Street crash of 1929) was on the following day, October 29, 1929.

== Personal life ==
From 1900 to 1912, Burton owned a country residence in Dover (now Westlake), Ohio, which had been built in 1838 by Thomas and Jane Hurst. The house was recorded in the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1936, and commemorated by an Ohio Historical Marker in 2002.

<text>Frank Bunker Gilbreth (July 7, 1868Â â June 14, 1924) was an American engineer, consultant, and author known as an early advocate of scientific management and a pioneer of time and motion study, and is perhaps best known as the father and central figure of &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;.

Both he and his wife Lillian Moller Gilbreth were industrial engineers and efficiency experts who contributed to the study of industrial engineering in fields such as motion study and human factors.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Gilbreth was born in Fairfield, Maine, on July 7, 1868. He was the third child and only son of John Hiram Gilbreth and Martha Bunker Gilbreth. His mother had been a schoolteacher. His father owned a hardware store and was a stockbreeder. When Gilbreth was three and a half years old his father died suddenly from pneumonia.

After his father&#x27;s death his mother moved the family to Andover, Massachusetts, to find better schools for her children. The substantial estate left by her husband was managed by her husband&#x27;s family. By the fall of 1878 the money had been lost or stolen and Martha Gilbreth had to find a way to make a living. She moved the family to Boston where good public schools existed. She opened a boarding house since a schoolteacher&#x27;s salary would not support the family.

Gilbreth was not a good student. He attended Rice Grammar School, but his mother was concerned enough to teach him at home for a year. He attended Boston&#x27;s English High School, and his grades improved when he became interested in his science and math classes. He took the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but wanted his mother to be able to give up the boarding house. He decided to go to work rather than to college.

===Whidden Construction Company===
Renton Whidden, Gilbreth&#x27;s old Sunday School teacher, hired him for his building company. He was to start as a laborer, learn the various building trades, and work his way up in the firm. In July 1885 at age 17 he started as a bricklayer&#x27;s helper. As he learned bricklaying he noticed the many variations in the bricklayers&#x27; methods and efficiency. This began his interest in finding &quot;the one best way&quot; of executing any task. He quickly learned every part of building work and contracting, and advanced rapidly. He took night school classes to learn mechanical drawing. After five years he was a superintendent, which allowed his mother to give up her boarding house.

Using his observations of workmen laying brick, Gilbreth developed a multilevel scaffold that kept the bricks within easy reach of the bricklayer. He began patenting his innovations with this &quot;Vertical Scaffold&quot;, then developed and patented the &quot;Gilbreth Waterproof Cellar&quot;. He made innovations in concrete construction, as well. After ten years, at age 27, he was the chief superintendent. When after ten years the Whiddens were unwilling to make him a partner, he resigned to start his own company.

===Career as general contractor===
Gilbreth founded his own commercial contracting firm on April 1, 1895. For the next fifteen years, &quot;Frank B. Gilbreth, General Contractor&quot; and two subsidiary companies would build some 100 large-scale projects across the United States (along with two in Canada), including full scale factories, paper mills, canals, dams and powerhouses. The largest such project was a complete paper mill constructed in 1907â08 in Canton, North Carolina. It was a $2 million facility consisting of more than thirty full-scale industrial buildings.

One Gilbreth construction project was the Simmons Hardware Company&#x27;s Sioux City Warehouse. The architects had specified that hundreds of hardened concrete piles (based on Gibreth&#x27;s own patents for design and installation) were to be driven in to allow the soft ground to take the weight of two million bricks required to construct the building. The &quot;Time and Motion&quot; approach could be applied to the bricklaying and the transportation. The building was also required to support efficient input and output of deliveries via its own railroad switching facilities.

Gilbreth held thirteen patents as an inventor, beginning in his years with the Whiddens, and had patent and product management offices in London and Berlin. Other than two projects in Ontario, Canada, and a third that was abandoned after initial construction, he did not build any projects outside the United States.

===Career as efficiency expert===
Gilbreth changed careers to efficiency and management engineering with the close of his construction companies in about 1912. He eventually became an occasional lecturer at Purdue University, which houses his papers.

Gilbreth discovered his vocation as efficiency expert while still a young construction worker, when he sought ways to make bricklaying faster and easier. During the later part of his contracting career, this grew into a collaboration with his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth. Together they studied the work habits of manufacturing and clerical employees in all sorts of industries to find ways to increase output and make their jobs easier. He and Lillian founded a management consulting firm, Frank B. Gilbreth, Inc. (renamed Gilbreth, Inc. after his death), focusing on such endeavors.

Gilbreth was also an adamant champion of the &quot;cost-plus-a-fixed sum&quot; contract in his building contracting business. He described this method in an article in Industrial Magazine in 1907, comparing it to fixed price and guaranteed maximum price methods. Many of his prolific advertisements throughout the era boast of and recommend this as &quot;their special method of construction.&quot;

=== Family ===
Gilbreth married Lillian Evelyn Moller on October 19, 1904, in Oakland, California; they had 12 children. Their names were Anne Moller Gilbreth Barney (1905â1987), Mary Elizabeth Gilbreth (1906â1912), Ernestine Moller Gilbreth Carey (1908â2006), Martha Bunker Gilbreth Tallman (1909â1968), Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. (1911â2001), William Moller Gilbreth (1912â1990), Lillian Gilbreth Johnson (1914â2001), Frederick Moller Gilbreth (1916â2015), Daniel Bunker Gilbreth (1917â2006), John Moller Gilbreth (1919â2002), Robert Moller Gilbreth (1920â2007), and Jane Moller Gilbreth Heppes (1922â2006); there was also a stillborn daughter (1915) who was not named.

=== Death ===
Gilbreth died of a heart attack on June 14, 1924, at age 55. He was at the Lackawanna Terminal in Montclair, New Jersey, talking with his wife by telephone. In accordance with his wishes, his brain was donated to Harvard University, and his ashes were scattered in the Atlantic Ocean. Lillian outlived him by 48 years.

== Work ==

=== Motion studies ===
Gilbreth served as a major in the U.S. Army during World War I. His assignment was to find quicker and more efficient means of assembling and disassembling small arms. However, he was stricken with rheumatic fever and then pneumonia just weeks into his service, and spent four months in recovery before being discharged. The heart damage from this episode would contribute to his premature death six years later. According to Claude George (1968), Gilbreth reduced all motions of the hand into some combination of 17 basic motions. These included grasp, transport loaded, and hold. Gilbreth named the motions therbligsÂ â &quot;Gilbreth&quot; spelled (approximately) backwards. He used a motion picture camera that was calibrated in fractions of minutes to time the smallest of motions in workers.

Their emphasis on the &quot;one best way&quot; and therbligs predates the development of continuous quality improvement (CQI), and the late 20th century understanding that repeated motions can lead to workers experiencing repetitive motion injuries.

Gilbreth was the first to propose the position of &quot;caddy&quot; (Gilbreth&#x27;s term) to a surgeon, who handed surgical instruments to the surgeon as needed. Gilbreth also devised the standard techniques used by armies around the world to teach recruits how to rapidly disassemble and reassemble their weapons even when blindfolded or in total darkness.

=== Scientific management ===
The work of the Gilbreths is often associated with that of Frederick Winslow Taylor, yet there was a substantial philosophical difference between the Gilbreths and Taylor. The symbol of Taylorism was the stopwatch; Taylor was concerned primarily with reducing process times. The Gilbreths, in contrast, sought to make processes more efficient by reducing the motions involved. They saw their approach as more concerned with workers&#x27; welfare than Taylorism, which workers themselves often perceived as concerned mainly with profit. This difference led to a personal rift between Taylor and the Gilbreths which, after Taylor&#x27;s death, turned into a feud between the Gilbreths and Taylor&#x27;s followers. After Frank&#x27;s death, Lillian Gilbreth took steps to heal the rift; however, some friction remains over questions of history and intellectual property.

=== Fatigue study ===
In conducting their Motion Study method to work, they found that the key to improving work efficiency was in reducing unnecessary motions. Not only were some motions unnecessary, but they caused employee fatigue. Their efforts to reduce fatigue included reduced motions, tool redesign, parts placement, and bench and seating height, for which they began to develop workplace standards. The Gilbreths&#x27; work broke ground for contemporary understanding of ergonomics.

== Legacy ==
Frank and Lillian Gilbreth often used their large family (and Frank himself) as guinea pigs in experiments. Their family exploits are lovingly detailed in the 1948 book &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, written by son Frank Jr. and daughter Ernestine (Ernestine Gilbreth Carey). The book inspired a film and the title inspired a second and third unrelated film of the same name. The first, in 1950, starred Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy. The second, in 2003, starred comedians Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, and bears no resemblance to the book, except that it features a family with twelve children, and the wife&#x27;s maiden name is Gilbreth. The third, in 2022, also bears no relation to the book and starred Gabrielle Union and Zach Braff. A 1952 sequel titled &quot;Belles on Their Toes&quot; chronicled the adventures of the Gilbreth family after Frank&#x27;s 1924 death. A later biography of his parents, &quot;Time Out For Happiness,&quot; was written by Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr. alone in 1962.

The award for lifetime achievement by the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) is named in Frank and Lillian Gilbreth&#x27;s honor.

His maxim of &quot;I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it&quot; is still commonly used today, although it is often misattributed to Bill Gates, who merely repeated the quote but did not originate it.

<text>Todd &quot;Squee&quot; Casil is a fictional character in Jhonen Vasquez&#x27;s comic book &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;, who was later featured in his own four-issue series, published by Slave Labor Graphics. This was eventually collected as a Trade paperback (TPB), titled Squee&#x27;s Wonderful Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors.

==Squee==
Todd Casil, better known as Squee after the noise he makes when frightened, is a young boy who first appeared in issue #1, living next door to the title character, Johnny C. His parents neglect him (especially his father, who works long hours) and his only shown friend other than Johnny is a small teddy bear that he carries around named Shmee. Shmee tells Squee in a dream that all his fears and nightmares are inside him. Squee is also friends with Satan&#x27;s son Pepito, with whom he attends school. He later had his own series called &quot;Squee!&quot;, which was collected in &quot;Squee&#x27;s Wonderful Big Giant Book Of Unspeakable Horrors&quot;. He also had another friend named Andy, but he was attacked and killed by a dog.

A quiet, introverted child who is frequently targeted by bullies, Squee has been forced to mature a bit more quickly than his peers. He is fond of writing, but only receives criticism from his teacher and taunting from his classmates. Any attempts he makes to deflect these hostilities only result in being shoved into the dirt or otherwise humiliated. Squee&#x27;s mother is addicted to some form of a pill and spends a lot of time lying around in a nearly incoherent state. She often forgets who Squee is, or that she even has a child. Squee&#x27;s father loathes him and never misses a chance to blame Squee for &#x27;ruining&#x27; his life, claiming that he &quot;hasn&#x27;t smiled once since [Squee] was born.&quot; Having little patience for anything Squee says or does, he eventually becomes convinced that Squee is mentally unstable, and by the end of the series, has him committed to the &quot;Defective Head Meat Institute.&quot; Squee&#x27;s grandfather claims to keep himself healthy and young by consuming his children&#x27;s first-borns, and subsequently attempts to devour Squee, only to reveal in a horrifying fashion that he is in fact a cyborg and quite possibly insane.

Squee&#x27;s next-door neighbor is Johnny C, aka &quot;Nny&quot; (pronounced knee), the main character of the series. &quot;Nny&quot; regularly visits Squee late at night by breaking into his room. The series focused more on the &#x27;mentoring&#x27; or &#x27;big brother&#x27; aspect of &quot;Nny&quot; and Squee&#x27;s relationship, but little interaction occurs in &quot;Squee!&quot;, aside from the occasional drawing or note left in Squee&#x27;s room, or short references to &#x27;the crazy neighbor man&#x27; (he does appear as an out-patient of &quot;Defective Head Meat Institute&quot;, who Squee is oddly pleased to see). Squee has only one friend, albeit a possibly imaginary one, the dilapidated teddy bear affectionately referred to as Shmee. Only one real person makes any attempt to befriend Squee, a boy named Pepito who happens to be the Antichrist. During the course of the series, Squee encounters a killer chihuahua (that fatally mauls the only classmate who was friendly to him), zombified classmates, sporting mishaps, alien abductions, near recruitment into Satan&#x27;s army, an encounter with his future self, a ghostly visitor, a giant murderous dust mite, and eventual committal to a mental institution despite being one of the sanest characters in the comic (however it&#x27;s strongly implied he ends up hiding out with Pepito). These experiences lead him to remark to a &#x27;lamb-baby-dog-thing&#x27; in one strip that some bitter cartoonist must be drawing his life and therefore he doesn&#x27;t want to get too attached to anyone or anything in it.

===Shmee===

Squee carries around with him a dilapidated teddy bear he named Shmee. Often, Squee talks to Shmee like a real person, confiding in the stuffed toy, who apparently responds even though their dialogue is non-readable, the one exception being a strip in which Squee has a conversation with Shmee in his dreams. Shmee claims to be a &#x27;trauma sponge,&#x27; soaking up all the negative feelings and experiences and storing them inside himself for Squee. He says this will prevent Squee from becoming like Johnny C. During the silent exchanges they share on various occasions, Shmee often suggests that Squee do something violent, such as arson, in retaliation for some wrong committed against him. Squee laughs these suggestions off, assuming that Shmee is joking, though to the reader it is fairly obvious that he is not.

<text>MAC (stylized as mac; formerly and legally Midlands Arts Centre) is a non-profit arts centre situated in Cannon Hill Park, Edgbaston, Birmingham, England. It was established in 1962 and is registered as an educational charity which hosts art exhibitions, Indie Cinema, live performances and Creative Courses for all ages.

The centre re-opened in May 2010 after a Â£15m facelift. It has four performance auditoria, rehearsal and media studios, a cinema, cafÃ©, bar and art gallery. With 1,028,371 visits in 2015, MAC is the 14th most-visited free attractions in England.

==History==

The idea for an arts centre in Cannon Hill Park was the result of a meeting between local residents: theatre writer and director John English, his wife, Mollie Randle, and local politician Frank Price in the late 1950s. Eventually of land in Cannon Hill Park was made available by Birmingham City Council in 1962 for this purpose. It also housed the Cannon Hill Puppet Theatre under John M. Blundall. The foundation stone for the new arts centre was laid on 19 June 1962 by six people representing those for whom the centre was intended.

In 1965 director Mike Leigh went to work at the theatre and started experimenting with the idea that writing and rehearsing could potentially be part of the same process. Between 1972 and 1987 it was the home of the former Birmingham Youth Theatre, a company aimed at encouraging and nurturing talent amongst people aged 15 to 23 who were not involved with drama or theatre. This company was founded by local teacher Derek Nicholls, who later became Director of the mac. Adrian Lester and Andrew Tiernan began their careers there.

Other artists who performed here include Yoko Ono, Kate Malone, and Ewen Henderson; and renowned musicians and bands such as Ruby Turner, Ocean Colour Scene, UB40, and ELO played at MAC in the early stages of their career. Indian classical dancer Nahid Siddiqui taught Kathak classes here, and famous Bharatanatyam exponent Chitra Bolar started teaching at MAC in 1978. Their contributions established MAC as a centre for South Asian dance and performing arts.

The centre closed from April 2008 to 1 May 2010 for a Â£14.8 million refurbishment. MAC had 1.7 million visitors in the subsequent two years.

In 2021, MAC received Â£1.7 million of development investment, including for a new cafÃ© and restaurant.

In 2023, potentially dangerous RACC concrete was found in the roof, causing the temporary closure of the theatre and some studios.

<text>Cyrus Locher (March 8, 1878August 17, 1929) was a Democratic politician from Ohio. He served in the U.S. Senate.

He graduated from high school at Pandora, Ohio, and from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1903, when he gave the commencement oration. He was later that year named superintendent of schools at Woodsfield, Ohio. He graduated from Western Reserve University Law School. He also studied briefly at the University of Michigan.

Locher served in various capacities as a prosecutor and public solicitor, as well as law professor in Cleveland, Ohio during the 1910s and 1920s. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate on April 4, 1928 upon the death of Senator Frank B. Willis. Locher served until December 14, 1928, having lost a bid for the nomination in a special election to fill the remainder of Willis&#x27;s term.

His nephew, Ralph S. Locher, would serve as both the mayor of Cleveland, Ohio from 1962â67, and as an Ohio Supreme Court Justice for two terms between 1977-89.

<doc id="712786" wikidata="Q967676" url="?curid=712786" title="Rocketdyne J-2">
<text>The J-2, commonly known as Rocketdyne J-2, was a liquid-fuel cryogenic rocket engine used on NASA&#x27;s Saturn IB and Saturn V launch vehicles. Built in the United States by Rocketdyne, the J-2 burned cryogenic liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellants, with each engine producing of thrust in vacuum. The engine&#x27;s preliminary design dates back to recommendations of the 1959 Silverstein Committee. Rocketdyne won approval to develop the J-2 in June 1960 and the first flight, AS-201, occurred on 26 February 1966. The J-2 underwent several minor upgrades over its operational history to improve the engine&#x27;s performance, with two major upgrade programs, the de Laval nozzle-type J-2S and aerospike-type J-2T, which were cancelled after the conclusion of the Apollo program.

The engine produced a specific impulse (&quot;I&quot;sp) of in a vacuum (or at sea level) and had a mass of approximately . Five J-2 engines were used on the Saturn V&#x27;s S-II second stage, and one J-2 was used on the S-IVB upper stage used on both the Saturn IB and Saturn V. Proposals also existed to use various numbers of J-2 engines in the upper stages of an even larger rocket, the planned Nova. The J-2 was America&#x27;s largest production LH2-fuelled rocket engine before the RS-25. A modernized version of the engine, the J-2X, was considered for use on the Earth Departure Stage of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle replacement, the Space Launch System.

Unlike most liquid-fueled rocket engines in service at the time, the J-2 was designed to be restarted once after shutdown when flown on the Saturn V S-IVB third stage. The first burn, lasting about two minutes, placed the Apollo spacecraft into a low Earth parking orbit. After the crew verified that the spacecraft was operating nominally, the J-2 was re-ignited for translunar injection, a 6.5 minute burn which accelerated the vehicle to a course for the Moon.

==Components==
===Thrust chamber and gimbal system===
The J-2&#x27;s thrust chamber assembly served as a mount for all engine components, and was composed of the thrust chamber body, injector and dome assembly, gimbal bearing assembly, and augmented spark igniter.

The thrust chamber was constructed of thick stainless steel tubes, stacked longitudinally and furnace-brazed to form a single unit. The chamber was bell-shaped with a 27.5:1 expansion area ratio for efficient operation at altitude, and was regeneratively cooled by the fuel. Fuel entered from a manifold, located midway between the thrust chamber throat and the exit, at a pressure of more than . In cooling the chamber, the fuel made a one-half pass downward through 180 tubes and was returned in a full pass up to the thrust chamber injector through 360 tubes. Once propellants passed through the injector, they were ignited by the augmented spark igniter and burned to impart a high velocity to the expelled combustion gases to produce thrust.

The thrust chamber injector received the propellants under pressure from the turbopumps, then mixed them in a manner that produced the most efficient combustion. 614 hollow oxidizer posts were machined to form an integral part of the injector, with fuel nozzles (each swaged to the face of the injector) threaded through and installed over the oxidizer posts in concentric rings. The injector face was porous, being formed from layers of stainless steel wire mesh, and was welded at its periphery to the injector body. The injector received LOX through the dome manifold and injected it through the oxidizer posts into the combustion area of the thrust chamber, while fuel was received from the upper fuel manifold in the thrust chamber and injected through the fuel orifices which were concentric with the oxidizer orifices. The propellants were injected uniformly to ensure satisfactory combustion. The injector and oxidizer dome assembly was located at the top of the thrust chamber. The dome provided a manifold for the distribution of the LOX to the injector and served as a mount for the gimbal bearing and the augmented spark igniter.

The augmented spark igniter (ASI) was mounted to the injector face and provided the flame to ignite the propellants in the combustion chamber. When engine start was initiated, the spark exciters energized two spark plugs mounted in the side of the combustion chamber. Simultaneously, the control system started the initial flow of oxidizer and fuel to the spark igniter. As the oxidizer and fuel entered the combustion chamber of the ASI, they mixed and were ignited, with proper ignition being monitored by an ignition monitor mounted in the ASI. The ASI operated continuously during entire engine firing, was uncooled, and was capable of multiple reignitions under all environmental conditions.

Thrust was transmitted through the gimbal (mounted to the injector and oxidizer dome assembly and the vehicle&#x27;s thrust structure), which consisted of a compact, highly loaded () universal joint consisting of a spherical, socket-type bearing. This was covered with a Teflon/fiberglass coating that provided a dry, low-friction bearing surface. The gimbal included a lateral adjustment device for aligning the combustion chamber with the vehicle, so that, in addition to transmitting the thrust from the injector assembly to the vehicle thrust structure, the gimbal also provided a pivot bearing for deflection of the thrust vector, thus providing flight attitude control of the vehicle.

===Propellant feed system===
The propellant feed system consists of separate fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (the bearings of which were lubricated by the fluid being pumped because the extremely low operating temperature of the engine precluded use of lubricants or other fluids), several valves (including the main fuel valve, main oxidizer valve, propellant utilization valve and fuel and oxidizer bleed valves), fuel and oxidizer flowmeters, and interconnecting lines.

====Fuel turbopump====
The fuel turbopump, mounted on the thrust chamber, was a turbine-driven, axial flow pumping unit consisting of an inducer, a seven-stage rotor, and a stator assembly. It was a high-speed pump operating at 27,000Â rpm, and was designed to increase hydrogen pressure from (absolute) through high-pressure ducting at a flowrate which develops . Power for operating the turbopump was provided by a high-speed, two-stage turbine. Hot gas from the gas generator was routed to the turbine inlet manifold which distributed the gas to the inlet nozzles where it was expanded and directed at a high velocity into the first stage turbine wheel. After passing through the first stage turbine wheel, the gas was redirected through a ring of stator blades and enters the second stage turbine wheel. The gas left the turbine through the exhaust ducting. Three dynamic seals in series prevented the pump fluid and turbine gas from mixing. Power from the turbine was transmitted to the pump by means of a one-piece shaft.

====Oxidizer turbopump====
The oxidizer turbopump was mounted on the thrust chamber diametrically opposite the fuel turbopump. It was a single-stage centrifugal pump with direct turbine drive. The oxidizer turbopump increases the pressure of the LOX and pumps it through high-pressure ducts to the thrust chamber. The pump operated at 8,600Â rpm at a discharge pressure of (absolute) and developed . The pump and its two turbine wheels are mounted on a common shaft. Power for operating the oxidizer turbopump was provided by a high-speed, two-stage turbine which was driven by the exhaust gases from the gas generator. The turbines of the oxidizer and fuel turbopumps were connected in a series by exhaust ducting that directed the discharged exhaust gas from the fuel turbopump turbine to the inlet of the oxidizer turbopump turbine manifold. One static and two dynamic seals in series prevented the turbopump oxidizer fluid and turbine gas from mixing.

Beginning the turbopump operation, hot gas entered the nozzles and, in turn, the first stage turbine wheel. After passing through the first stage turbine wheel, the gas was redirected by the stator blades and entered the second stage turbine wheel. The gas then left the turbine through exhaust ducting, passed through the heat exchanger, and exhausted into the thrust chamber through a manifold directly above the fuel inlet manifold. Power from the turbine was transmitted by means of a one-piece shaft to the pump. The velocity of the LOX was increased through the inducer and impeller. As the LOX entered the outlet volute, velocity was converted to pressure and the LOX was discharged into the outlet duct at high pressure.

====Fuel and oxidizer flowmeters====
The fuel and oxidizer flowmeters were helical-vaned, rotor-type flowmeters. They were located in the fuel and oxidizer high-pressure ducts. The flowmeters measured propellant flowrates in the high-pressure propellant ducts. The four-vane rotor in the hydrogen system produced four electrical impulses per revolution and turned approximately 3,700Â rpm at nominal flow. The six-vane rotor in the LOX system produced six electrical impulses per revolution and turned at approximately 2,600Â rpm at nominal flow.

====Valves====
The propellant feed system required a number of valves to control the operation of the engine by changing the flow of propellant through the engine&#x27;s components:
*The main fuel valve was a butterfly-type valve, spring-loaded to the closed position, pneumatically operated to the open position, and pneumatically assisted to the closed position. It was mounted between the fuel high-pressure duct from the fuel turbopump and the fuel inlet manifold of the thrust chamber assembly. The main fuel valve controlled the flow of fuel to the thrust chamber. Pressure from the ignition stage control valve on the pneumatic control package opened the valve during engine start and, as the gate started to open, it allowed fuel to flow to the fuel inlet manifold.
*The main oxidizer valve (MOV) was a butterfly-type valve, spring-loaded to the closed position, pneumatically operated to the open position, and pneumatically assisted to the closed position. It was mounted between the oxidizer high-pressure duct from the oxidizer turbopump and the oxidizer inlet on the thrust chamber assembly. Pneumatic pressure from the normally closed port of the mainstage control solenoid valve was routed to both the first and second stage opening actuators of the main oxidizer valve. Application of opening pressure in this manner, together with controlled venting of the main oxidizer valve closing pressure through a thermal-compensating orifice, provided a controlled ramp opening of the main oxidizer valve through all temperature ranges. A sequence valve, located within the MOV assembly, supplied pneumatic pressure to the opening control part of the gas generator control valve and through an orifice to the closing part of the oxidizer turbine bypass valve.
*The propellant utilization (PU) valve was an electrically operated, two-phase, motor-driven, oxidizer transfer valve and is located at the oxidizer turbopump outlet volute. The propellant utilization valve ensured the simultaneous exhaustion of the contents of the propellant tanks. During engine operation, propellant level sensing devices in the vehicle propellant tanks controlled the valve gate position for adjusting the oxidizer flow to ensure simultaneous exhaustion of fuel and oxidizer.
:*An additional function of the PU Valve was to provide thrust variations in order to maximize payload. The second stage, for example, operated with the PU valve in the closed position for more than 70% of the firing duration. This valve position provided of thrust at a 5.5:1 propellant (oxidizer to fuel by weight) mixture ratio (when the PU valve was fully open, the mixture ratio was 4.5:1 and the thrust level was ), though with a higher specific impulse due to more unburned hydrogen in the exhaust. During the latter portion of the flight, the PU valve position was varied to provide simultaneous emptying of the propellant tanks. The third stage also operated at the high-thrust level for the majority of the burning time in order to realize the high thrust benefits. The exact period of time at which the engine operated with the PU valve closed varied with individual mission requirements and propellant tanking levels.
*The propellant bleed valves used in both the fuel and oxidizer systems were poppet-type, which were spring-loaded to the normally open position and pressure-actuated to the closed position. Both propellant bleed valves were mounted to the bootstrap lines adjacent to their respective turbopump discharge flanges. The valves allowed propellant to circulate in the propellant feed system lines to achieve proper operating temperature prior to engine start, and were engine controlled. At engine start, a helium control solenoid valve in the pneumatic control package was energized allowing pneumatic pressure to close the bleed valves, which remained closed during engine operation.

===Gas generator and exhaust system===
The gas generator system consisted of the gas generator, gas generator control valve, turbine exhaust system and exhaust manifold, heat exchanger, and oxidizer turbine bypass valve.

====Gas generator====
The gas generator itself was welded to the fuel pump turbine manifold, making it an integral part of the fuel turbopump assembly. It produced hot gases to drive the fuel and oxidizer turbines and consisted of a combustor containing two spark plugs, a control valve containing fuel and oxidizer ports, and an injector assembly. When engine start was initiated, the spark exciters in the electrical control package were energized, providing energy to the spark plugs in the gas generator combustor. Propellants flowed through the control valve to the injector assembly and into the combustor outlet, before being directed to the fuel turbine and then to the oxidizer turbine.

====Valves====
*The gas generator control valve was a pneumatically operated poppet-type that was spring-loaded to the closed position. The fuel and oxidizer poppets were mechanically linked by an actuator. The valve controlled the flow of propellants through the gas generator injector. When the mainstage signal was received, pneumatic pressure was applied against the gas generator control valve actuator assembly which moved the piston and opened the fuel poppet. During the fuel poppet opening, an actuator contacted the piston that opened the oxidizer poppet. As the opening pneumatic pressure decayed, spring loads closed the poppets.
*The oxidizer turbine bypass valve was a normally open, spring-loaded, gate type valve. It was mounted in the oxidizer turbine bypass duct and equipped with a nozzle, the size of which was determined during engine calibration. The valve in its open position depressed the speed of the oxygen pump during start, and in its closed position acted as a calibration device for the turbopump performance balance.

====Turbine exhaust system====
The turbine exhaust ducting and turbine exhaust hoods were of welded sheet metal construction. Flanges utilizing dual seals were used at component connections. The exhaust ducting conducted turbine exhaust gases to the thrust chamber exhaust manifold which encircled the combustion chamber approximately halfway between the throat and the nozzle exit. Exhaust gases passed through the heat exchanger and exhaust into the main combustion chamber through 180 triangular openings between the tubes of the combustion chamber.

====Heat exchanger====
The heat exchanger was a shell assembly, consisting of a duct, bellows, flanges, and coils. It was mounted in the turbine exhaust duct between the oxidizer turbine discharge manifold and the thrust chamber. It heated and expanded helium gas for use in the third stage or converted LOX to gaseous oxygen for the second stage for maintaining vehicle oxidizer tank pressurization. During engine operation, either LOX was tapped off the oxidizer high-pressure duct or helium was provided from the vehicle stage and routed to the heat exchanger coils.

===Start tank assembly system===
This system was made up of an integral helium and hydrogen start tank, which contained the hydrogen and helium gases for starting and operating the engine. The gaseous hydrogen imparted initial spin to the turbines and pumps prior to gas generator combustion, and the helium was used in the control system to sequence the engine valves. The spherical helium tank was positioned inside the hydrogen tank to minimize engine complexity. It held of helium. The larger spherical hydrogen gas tank had a capacity of . Both tanks were filled from a ground source prior to launch and the gaseous hydrogen tank was refilled during engine operation from the thrust chamber fuel inlet manifold for subsequent restart in third stage application.

===Control system===
The control system included a pneumatic system and a solid-state electrical sequence controller packaged with spark exciters for the gas generator and the thrust chamber spark plugs, plus interconnecting electrical cabling and pneumatic lines, in addition to the flight instrumentation system. The pneumatic system consisted of a high-pressure helium gas storage tank, a regulator to reduce the pressure to a usable level, and electrical solenoid control valves to direct the central gas to the various pneumatically controlled valves. The electrical sequence controller was a completely self-contained, solid-state system, requiring only DC power and start and stop command signals. Pre-start status of all critical engine control functions was monitored in order to provide an &quot;engine ready&quot; signal. Upon obtaining &quot;engine ready&quot; and &quot;start&quot; signals, solenoid control valves were energized in a precisely timed sequence to bring the engine through ignition, transition, and into main-stage operation. After shutdown, the system automatically reset for a subsequent restart.

====Flight instrumentation system====
The flight instrumentation system was composed of a primary instrumentation package and an auxiliary package. The primary package instrumentation measures those parameters critical to all engine static firings and subsequent vehicle launches. These include some 70 parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and valve positions for the engine components, with the capability of transmitting signals to a ground recording system or a telemetry system, or both. The instrumentation system was designed for use throughout the life of the engine, from the first static acceptance firing to its ultimate vehicle flight. The auxiliary package was designed for use during early vehicle flights. It may be deleted from the basic engine instrumentation system after the propulsion system has established its reliability during research and development vehicle flights. It contains sufficient flexibility to provide for deletion, substitution, or addition of parameters deemed necessary as a result of additional testing. Eventual deletion of the auxiliary package will not interfere with the measurement capability of the primary package.

==Engine operation==

===Start sequence===
Start sequence was initiated by supplying energy to two spark plugs in the gas generator and two in the augmented spark igniter for ignition of the propellants. Next, two solenoid valves were actuated; one for helium control, and one for ignition phase control. Helium was routed to hold the propellant bleed valves closed and to purge the thrust chamber LOX dome, the LOX pump intermediate seal, and the gas generator oxidizer passage. In addition, the main fuel and ASI oxidizer valves were opened, creating an ignition flame in the ASI chamber that passed through the center of the thrust chamber injector.

After a delay of 1, 3, or 8 seconds, during which time fuel was circulated through the thrust chamber to condition the engine for start, the start tank discharge valve was opened to initiate turbine spin. The length of the fuel lead was dependent upon the length of the Saturn V first stage boost phase. When the engine was used in the S-II stage, a 1-second fuel lead was necessary. The S-IVB, on the other hand, utilized a 1-second fuel lead for its initial start and an 8-second fuel lead for its restart.

After an interval of 0.450Â seconds, the start tank discharge valve was closed and a mainstage control solenoid was actuated to:
#Turn off gas generator and thrust chamber helium purges
#Open the gas generator control valve (hot gases from the gas generator now drive the pump turbines)
#Open the main oxidizer valve to the first position (14 degrees) allowing LOX to flow to the LOX dome to burn with the fuel that has been circulating through the injector
#Close the oxidizer turbine bypass valve (a portion of the gases for driving the oxidizer turbopump were bypassed during the ignition phase)
#Gradually bleed the pressure from the closing side of the oxidizer valve pneumatic actuator controlling the slow opening of this valve for smooth transition into mainstage.
Energy in the spark plugs was cut off and the engine was operating at rated thrust. During the initial phase of engine operation, the gaseous hydrogen start tank would be recharged in those engines having a restart requirement. The hydrogen tank was repressurized by tapping off a controlled mixture of LH2 from the thrust chamber fuel inlet manifold and warmer hydrogen from the thrust chamber fuel injection manifold just before entering the injector.

===Flight mainstage operation===
During mainstage operation, engine thrust could be varied between by actuating the propellant utilization valve to increase or decrease oxidizer flow. This was beneficial to flight trajectories and for overall mission performance to make greater payloads possible.

===Cutoff sequence===
When the engine cutoff signal was received by the electrical control package, it de-energized the main-stage and ignition phase solenoid valves and energized the helium control solenoid de-energizer timer. This, in turn, permitted closing pressure to the main fuel, main oxidizer, gas generator control, and augmented spark igniter valves. The oxidizer turbine bypass valve and propellant bleed valves opened and the gas generator and LOX dome purges were initiated.

===Engine restart===
To provide third stage restart capability for the Saturn V, the J-2 gaseous hydrogen start tank was refilled in 60 seconds during the previous firing after the engine had reached steady-state operation (refill of the gaseous helium tank was not required because the original ground-fill supply was sufficient for three starts). Prior to engine restart, the stage ullage rockets were fired to settle the propellants in the stage propellant tanks, ensuring a liquid head to the turbopump inlets. In addition, the engine propellant bleed valves were opened, the stage recirculation valve was opened, the stage prevalve was closed, and a LOX and LH2 circulation was effected through the engine bleed system for five minutes to condition the engine to the proper temperature to ensure proper engine operation. Engine restart was initiated after the &quot;engine ready&quot; signal was received from the stage. This was similar to the initial &quot;engine ready&quot;. The hold time between cutoff and restart was from a minimum of 1.5Â hours to a maximum of 6 hours, depending upon the number of Earth orbits required to attain the lunar window for translunar trajectory.

==History==

===Development===

Inspiration for the J-2 dates back to various NASA studies conducted in the late 1950s, of LH2-fuelled engines producing thrust of up to following the success of the RL-10 used on the Atlas-Centaur&#x27;s Centaur upper stage. As ever-heavier launch vehicles entered consideration, NASA began to look at engines producing thrusts of up to , with development being officially authorized following the 1959 report of the Saturn Vehicle Evaluation Committee. A source evaluation board was formed to nominate a contractor from five bidding companies, and approval was given on 1 June 1960 for Rocketdyne to begin development of a &quot;high-energy rocket engine, fuelled by LOX and hydrogen, to be known as the J-2&quot;. The final contract, awarded in September 1960, was the first to explicitly require the design &quot;insure maximum safety for crewed flight.&quot;

Rocketdyne launched the development of the J-2 with an analytical computer model that simulated engine operations and aided in establishing design configurations. The model was supported by a full-sized mockup which was used throughout development to judge the positioning of the engine&#x27;s components. The first experimental component, the engine&#x27;s injector, was produced within two months of the contract being awarded, and testing of the engine&#x27;s components began at Rocketdyne&#x27;s Santa Susana Field Laboratory in November 1960. Other test facilities, including a vacuum chamber and full-size engine test stand, were used during the development, with the engine&#x27;s turbopumps entering testing in November 1961, the ignition system in early 1962, and the first prototype engine running a complete 250-second test run in October 1962. In addition to flight hardware, five engine simulators were also used during the development process, assisting in the design of the engine&#x27;s electrical and mechanical systems. Contracts were signed between NASA and Rocketdyne in the summer of 1962, requiring 55 J-2 engines to be produced to support the final designs for the Saturn rockets, which required five engines for each S-II second stage of the Saturn V and one engine for each S-IVB Saturn IB and Saturn V third stage.

The J-2 entered production in May 1963, with concurrent testing programs continuing to run at Rocketdyne and at MSFC during the manufacturing run. The first production engine, delivered in April 1964, went for static tests on the S-IVB test stage at the Douglas test facility near Sacramento, California and underwent its first full-duration (410 seconds) static test in December 1964. Testing continued until January 1966, with one engine in particular igniting successfully in 30 successive firings, including five tests at full duration of 470 seconds each. The total firing time of 3774 seconds represented a level of accumulated operational time almost eight times greater than the flight requirements. As successful single-engine tests moved toward their completion, integration tests of the propulsion system with the S-IVB accelerated with the availability of more production engines. The first operational flight, AS-201, was scheduled in early 1966 for the Saturn IB using the S-IB first stage and the S-IVB as the second stage.

The first all-up test of a complete S-IVB, including its single J-2, in July 1965 was inconclusive when a component malfunction in one of the pneumatic consoles prematurely ended the test after a successful propellant loading and automatic countdown. Confidence in the design was regained in August, however, when the same stage, S-IVB-201, performed flawlessly on a full-duration firing of 452 seconds, which was the first engine test sequence to be controlled entirely by computers. The J-2 was cleared for flight and, on 26 February 1966, AS-201 went through a flawless launch.
In July 1966, NASA confirmed J-2 production contracts through 1968, by which time Rocketdyne agreed to finish deliveries of 155 J-2 engines, with each engine undergoing a flight qualification firing at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory before delivery to NASA. Reliability and development testing continued on the engine, with two uprated versions being used by NASA in the later flights of the Apollo program.

===Upgrades===

====J-2S====
An experimental program to improve the performance of the J-2 started in 1964 as the J-2X (not to be confused with a later variant by the same name). The main change to the original J-2 design was a change from the gas generator cycle to a tap-off cycle that supplied hot gas from a tap on the combustion chamber instead of a separate burner. In addition to removing parts from the engine, it also reduced the difficulty of starting up the engine and properly timing various combustors.

Additional changes included a throttling system for wider mission flexibility, which also required a variable mixture system to properly mix the fuel and oxygen for a variety of different operating pressures. It also included a new &quot;Idle Mode&quot; that produced little thrust for on-orbit maneuvering or to settle the fuel tanks on-orbit prior to a burn.

During the experimental program, Rocketdyne also produced a small run of six pre-production models for testing, the J-2S. These were test fired many times between 1965 and 1972, for a total of 30,858 seconds burn time. In 1972 it became clear no follow-on orders for Saturn boosters were coming, and the program shut down. NASA did consider using the J-2S on a number of different missions, including powering the Space Shuttle in a number of early designs as well as on the Comet HLLV.

====J-2T====
While work on the J-2S continued, NASA also funded a design effort to use the J-2S turbomachinery and plumbing to a toroidal combustion chamber with a new aerospike nozzle. This would improve performance even further. Two versions were built, the J-2T-200k that provided thrust, allowing it to be &quot;dropped in&quot; to the existing S-II and S-IVB stages, and the J-2T-250k of .

Like the J-2S, work on the J-2T had progressed to a lengthy series of ground-based test runs, but further development ended in the post-Apollo draw-down.

====J-2X====

What became a different engine with a similar name, called the J-2X, was chosen in 2007 for the Project Constellation crewed lunar landing program. A single J-2X engine, generating of thrust, was to be used to power the Earth Departure Stage (EDS).

NASA began construction of a new test stand for altitude testing of J-2X engines at Stennis Space Center (SSC) on 23 August 2007. Between December 2007 and May 2008, nine tests of heritage J-2 engine components were conducted at SSC in preparation for the design of the J-2X engine.

The new J-2X is designed to be more efficient and simpler to build than its Apollo J-2 predecessor, and cost less than the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). Design differences include the removal of beryllium, modern electronics, a centrifugal turbo pump versus the axial turbo pump of the J-2, a different chamber and nozzle expansion ratios, a channel-walled combustion chamber versus the tube-welded chamber of the J-2, a redesign of all the electronics, supersonic injection and the use of 21st-century joining techniques.

On July 16, 2007 NASA officially announced the award to Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne, Inc. of a $1.2 billion contract &quot;for design, development, testing and evaluation of the J-2X engine&quot; intended to power the upper stages of the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles. On Sept. 8, 2008 Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne announced successful testing of the initial J-2X gas generator design. The completion of a second round of successful gas generator tests was announced on September 21, 2010.

Project Constellation was cancelled by President Barack Obama on October 11, 2010, but development of the J-2X has continued for its potential as the second stage engine for the new, heavy-lift Space Launch System. The first hot-fire test of the J-2X was scheduled for late June, 2011.

On November 9, 2011 NASA conducted a successful firing of the J-2X engine of 499.97 seconds in duration.

On February 27, 2013 NASA continued testing of the J-2X engine of 550 seconds in duration at NASA&#x27;s Stennis Space Center.

In later times, however, the planned upper stage engine for what would become the Exploration Upper Stage for the SLS rocket has since been chosen instead as a variant of the RL-10, the RL-10C-3. As a result of this, development of the J-2X has ceased, with the program officially being &quot;idle&quot; since the end of the prototype&#x27;s testing regime in 2014.

<text>Pattaya is a city in Eastern Thailand, the second-largest city in Chonburi province and the eighth-largest city in Thailand. It is on the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand, about southeast of Bangkok, and has a population of 328,961 as of 2021.

Pattaya City (, , ) is a special local government organization area within Bang Lamung district and has a population of 119,532. It covers the &quot;tambons&quot; of Nong Prue and Na Klua and parts of Huai Yai and Nong Pla Lai. Pattaya City has grown into all adjacent sub-districts and accounts for the largest population percentage in the district, making it de facto a part of the &quot;Pattaya-Bang Lamung-Jomtien&quot; area, otherwise known as &quot;Greater Pattaya&quot;. 

The city is in the industrial Eastern seaboard zone, along with Si Racha, Laem Chabang, and Chonburi. Pattaya is at the center of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area (a in Chonburi Province with a population of 1,000,000), which forms the third largest metropolitan area in Thailand.

== History ==

=== Name ===
The name &quot;Pattaya&quot; evolved from the march of Phraya Tak (later King Taksin) and his army from Ayutthaya to Chanthaburi, which took place before the fall of the former capital to Burmese invaders in 1767. When his army arrived in the vicinity of what is now Pattaya, Phraya Tak encountered the troops of a local leader named Nai Klom, who tried to intercept him. When the two met face to face, Nai Klom was impressed by Phraya Tak&#x27;s dignified manner and his army&#x27;s strict discipline. He surrendered without a fight and joined his forces. 

The place the armies confronted each other was thereafter known as &quot;Thap Phraya&quot;, which means the &quot;army of the Phraya&quot;. Thap Phraya was later changed to &quot;Phatthaya&quot;, which means &#x27;the wind blowing from the southwest to the northeast at the beginning of the rainy season&#x27;.

=== Growth ===
Following World War II, entrepreneur Parinya Chawalitthamrong saw the potenial of investing in Pattaya and donated some land to the governing administration. Pattaya City Hall would later be constructed on this land.

A fishing village until the 1960s, tourism began during the Vietnam War, when American servicemen began arriving on R&amp;R (rest and relaxation). One large group who arrived from a base in Korat on 29 June 1959 and rented houses from Phraya Sunthorn at the south end of the beach, on what is now known as the &quot;Strip&quot;, are credited with recommending Pattaya, whose fame spread by word of mouth.

On 29 November 1978, Pattaya was granted city status by the Thai government. In 1978, it also became a special governed city.

In 1981, businessman Lek Viriyaphan began constructing on the Sanctuary of Truth which remains unfinished and is entirely made out of wood.

=== 21st century ===
In 2004, Nirun Wattanasartsaton became the first democratically elected mayor. In the 2008 mayoral election, Itthiphol Khunpluem became Pattaya&#x27;s mayor. As mayor, Itthiphol approved construction on the Waterfront Suites and Residence condominium near the Bali Hai pier, which became controversial. His approval later led to his arrest in 2023 over corruption.

Following the 2014 coup, the National Council for Peace and Order appointed two mayors until in 2018 when the Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha appointed Sontaya Kunplome, brother of Itthiphol, as mayor. Mayor Sontaya went on to form the Rao Rak Pattaya party which won the 2022 mayoral election led by Poramet Ngampichet, who has served as mayor ever since.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pattaya&#x27;s economy suffered greatly due to travel restrictions restricting tourism.

From the 2010s through to the 2020s, Pattaya attempted to shift public perception of it being a sex-city to a more family-friendly location. Bars which were friendly towards pedophiles in Sunee plaza were closed, and the amount of gogo bars on Walking Street declined. However, a 2023 documentary by Deutsche Welle, which has been banned in Thailand, resurrected concerns around Pattaya&#x27;s sex industry and its association with child prostitution. The documentary is around a German tourist who is claimed to have paid à¸¿â1 million to return to Germany and escape charges. The claims resulted in PM Srettha Thavisin launching an investigation headed by Surachate Hapkarn. The documentary has been described by local media as having the potential of hurting Pattaya&#x27;s industry which has been recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pattaya has frequently suffered from flooding, especially during the monsoon season. Torrential rain on 27 August 2021 left many important roads under water, with water reaching up to two metres deep in some areas. Pattaya City officials called the August flooding as the worst flood for Pattaya in a decade.

On 4 November 2023, Pattaya was awarded the Integrity and Transparency Assessment award for the highest development category. The award was presented by the National Anti-Corruption Commission to Poramet at Government House in Bangkok.

== Climate ==
Pattaya has a tropical wet and dry climate, which is divided into the following seasons: hot and dry (December to February), hot and humid (March and April), and &quot;hot and rainy&quot; (May to November).

== Demographics ==

The municipality has a population of 119,532 residents (2019), while the city (&quot;Greater Pattaya&quot;) has a population of 328,961 (2021). Most of these people counted are Thai, with most migrant populations not recognized, although migrant workers are increasingly regularized due to foreign pressure. Some details of the census remain complex, as even indigenous Thais without nationality are not being recognized. Therefore, the census population currently does not represent the total figure. 

As with the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, registered population figures issued by the National Statistics Office (NSO) and the Department of Provincial Administration (DOPA) hardly capture the scope of the urban transformation that has occurred over time, especially with the economy being dependent on the large numbers of casual Thai workers who work in the city yet remain registered in their hometowns, the employment turnover from and to the capital, as well as seasonal farm migration. Migrant workers from neighboring nations, and many long-term expatriates who reside in the city as retirees, self-employed, or contracted are traditionally not counted. There has never been a reliably published figure for the total population in Pattaya, but its thought to be quite large (on the order of half a million people) given the ubiquity and sheer number of migrant workers. Pattaya additionally has a massive population inflow from short stay tourism, with its 2000 hotels and 136,000 rooms available as of 2015.

Throughout the years, the municipality (Pattaya City) has outgrown its municipal borders (53.5Â kmÂ²) and now reaches into all neighboring subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) within the Bang Lamung district, forming the &quot;Pattaya-Bang Lamung-Jomtien&quot; area (727Â kmÂ²), also known as &quot;Greater Pattaya&quot;, though the commonly used term to describe the urban area is simply Pattaya. Changes in population and area size are regularly revised by the Department of Public Works and Town &amp; Country Planning and the Chonburi Provincial Administrative Organization.

Pattaya is part of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area, a conurbation of the urban areas of Chonburi, Si Racha and Pattaya. The total population of this area is 999,092, making it the third largest metropolitan area in the country after Bangkok and Chiang Mai.

A growing community of foreign retirees lives in Pattaya. The Thai Immigration Bureau has a special visa category for foreigners over the age of 50 who wish to retire in Thailand. The city also has a large Indian community, which mainly speaks Tamil.

== Physical geography ==
Pattaya, on the Gulf of Thailand, is approximately south of the city of Bangkok in Bang Lamung District, Chonburi Province.

The city of Pattaya is a special municipal area which covers the whole &quot;tambon&quot; Nong Prue (Nongprue) and Na Kluea (Naklua) and parts of Huai Yai and Nong Pla Lai. Bang Lamung township which forms the northern border of Pattaya covers parts of the &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Lamung (Banglamung), Nong Pla Lai and Takhian Tia. Bang Sare (Bang Saray) is on the southern border of Pattaya.

&quot;Greater Pattaya&quot; occupies most of the coastline of Banglamung (one of the eleven districts that make up Chonburi Province). It is divided into a larger northern section which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach (the most northern beach) and Pattaya Beach (the main beach) plus Phra Tamnak Hill (often called &quot;Buddha Hill&quot; because of the temples on top of the hill) headland immediately south of Pattaya Beach, and a smaller southern section covering the area to the east of Jomtien Beach (directly south of Phra Tamnak Hill).

=== Beaches and islands ===
The main sweep of the bay area is divided into two principal beachfronts. Pattaya Beach lies parallel to the city centre, and runs about 2.7Â km long from Pattaya Nuea (North) south along the coast to Pattaya Tai (South) which is the entrance to Walking Street. The beach, which used to be 35Â m wide, suffers from erosion and in some places was reduced to a width of only two to three meters. A 429 million baht beach restoration scheme was implemented in 2018. It will take 360,000Â m3 of sand from Ko Rang Kwian offshore to increase the beach width to 50Â m. 

Without intervention Pattaya will likely see its beaches disappear in roughly ten years according to Chulalongkorn University researchers. Within a month of the completion of the restoration of the first 400Â m of Pattaya Beach, the work was &quot;seriously damaged&quot; by flooding. The beach is the first in the country to use imported sand to compensate for coastal erosion. An official said, &quot;...the longer it is left without the flood damage being repaired, the worse it will get.&quot;

Phra Tamnak Hill is on the south side of Pattaya and is popular for its viewpoints and the temple (Wat Phra Yai) on top of the hill. Pattaya Park and Pattaya tower are at the south end of Phra Tamnak Hill and the Pattaya Exhibition And Convention Hall (P.E.A.C.H), is positioned at the north end of Phra Tamnak Hill. In recent years, Phra Tamnak Hill has gained in popularity because of its more natural environment, nicer beaches, and its convenient location between Jomtien and Pattaya city.

Jomtien is divided from Pattaya by Thepprasit Road, the southern route into Pattaya city. It consists of high-rise condominiums, beach side hotels, bungalow complexes, shops, bars, and restaurants.
Offshore islands include three &quot;near islands&quot;: Ko Lan (main island), Ko Sak, and Ko Krok, from the shore of Pattaya. The &quot;far islands&quot; are Ko Phai (main island), Ko Man Wichai, Ko Hu Chang and Ko Klung Badan, located offshore further west of the &quot;near islands&quot;. Ko Rin lies offshore to the south-west, south of Ko Phai group. The names &quot;near islands&quot;, &quot;far islands&quot;, and &quot;Coral Island&quot; are used for marketing purposes only and do not correspond to any naming conventions of the island groups and are not shown on maritime charts published by the Hydrographic Service of the Royal Thai Navy.

In June 2016, the Regional Environmental Office reported that, &quot;The sea water along the busy central Pattaya beaches is of poor quality and could endanger human and marine life.&quot;

==Environment==

Pattaya produces on the order of 450 tonnes of solid waste per day. The city spends more than 300 million baht on waste removal and disposal annually. On average it pays 1,600 baht to process each tonne of garbage. Significant volumes of rubbish are allegedly dumped into the sea by tour boats.

In July 2017 Pattaya Beach was fouled for a week by raw sewage that poured out of a storm drain. City officials blamed the incident on broken pumps and Pattaya&#x27;s poorly maintained sewage-treatment plant. The environmental ministry declared it would step up enforcement of pollution laws and push Pattaya for better wastewater-treatment efficiency. According to the ministry, Pattaya has 1,047 identified sources of sewage and garbage pollution, the number increasing as the city grows. 

The sea water along central Pattaya beaches is of poor quality even in the absence of sewage spills and &quot;could endanger human and marine life&quot;, the regional environmental office has said. They deemed sea water quality near central Pattaya beaches as &quot;poor&quot; and deteriorating. They judged water quality near Na Klua in North Pattaya, South Pattaya, Ko Lan, and Jomtien Beach as &quot;fairly good&quot;. The city has considered expanding two water management plants to increase capacity for better treatment of wastewater prior to discharge into the ocean. The water treatment plant in Soi Wat Nongyai after expansion would be able to treat around 130,000 cubic metres of waste water a day, up from 80,000 cubic metres at present. The expansion was never implemented.

In November 2018, the Pattaya City Council approved 188 million baht for the repair of its six wastewater treatment plants. Installed in 2000, the plants can accommodate 65,000 m3 of wastewater per day. More than a third of plant equipment was found to be 40â50 percent worn out. The system treats waste from a 36Â km2 portion of Pattaya, or 68 percent of its urban area. Earlier plans to increase treatment capacity to 135,000 m3 were never implemented and existing plants were allowed to fall into disrepair. Pattaya uses more than 200,000 m3 of water a day, but claims to only discharge about 70,000 m3 a day. The discrepancy is unexplained. Once treated, there are no tests to measure water quality before it is dumped back into the sea, which may account for foul water discharges.

==Economy==
Pattaya is at the center of Thailand&#x27;s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). Investments totaling more than 1.5 trillion baht (US$45 billion) are flowing into EEC infrastructure projects: airports, deep-sea ports, high-speed railways, autoroutes. The result will enhance Pattaya&#x27;s accessibility. According to the Thai Chamber of Commerce (TCC) the EEC investments, the U-Tapao International Airport and the high-speed train that will link three major airports to Pattaya, will make Pattaya the heart of the eastern region. The TCC view is that, &quot;Plenty of attractions...will lure lots more foreign and domestic tourists in the future.&quot; Better connectivity will reduce both the cost and time to travel to Pattaya, with the TCC estimating the number of tourists visiting the EEC region to rise to 46.7 million over the next few years, one and half times the current 29.8 million visitors. 

Pattaya projects include developing a tram in the city and building a bigger cruise terminal, as well as new tourist attractions: a water park, an ice dome, cultural markets, Thai boxing gyms, theaters, and conference halls. All are under development. &quot;We aimed to get rid of the previous [seedy] image of Pattaya and try to promote a new image to show that Pattaya is a place for everyone with diversity of new tourist attractions,&quot; said an official of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT). He said that the EEC would make Pattaya more competitive compared with other popular Thai beach destinations such as Phuket and Ko Samui, with cheaper transport costs.

Fourteen million visitors in 2018 contributed 239 billion baht to the city&#x27;s treasury. That represents more than 70% of Pattaya&#x27;s total income for the year. The city&#x27;s leadership plans to reduce Pattaya&#x27;s reliance on tourism to 60% by 2025 by transforming itself into &quot;Neo Pattaya&quot;, an international business center. Key to the plans are infrastructure improvements: 9.5 billion baht for flood management projects and upgrading sewage treatment plants to handle 130,000 m3 of waste per day, up from 67,000 m3 per day in 2019.

Pattaya&#x27;s thriving real estate market plays a pivotal role in bolstering the local economy. The continuous growth in the sector, particularly driven by foreign interest in condos, contributes significantly to employment, from construction to property management. Increased property transactions also generate substantial revenue through taxes and fees, further enhancing the city&#x27;s fiscal health.

During 2020-2022, Pattaya witnessed a limited number of new projects, resulting in high absorption rates. Notably, the second and third quarters of 2023 saw a remarkable uptick in condo launches, significantly elevating sales. In 2023, Pattaya maintained its lead in condo transfers to foreigners, surpassing Bangkok with proportions of 41.7% and 37.5%, respectively. This outperformed the average rates of 30.8% and 48.8% from 2018 to 2022.

== Transportation ==
;Road
#Via the Bangkok-Chonburi-Pattaya Motorway (Hwy 7). The motorway is linked with Bangkok&#x27;s Outer Ring Road (Hwy 9) and there is also another entrance at Si Nakharin and Rama IX Junction.
#Via Bang Na-Trat Highway (Hwy 34). From Bang Na, Bang Phli, across the Bang Pakong River to Chonburi there is a Chonburi bypass that meets Sukhumvit Road (Hwy 3), passing Bang Saen Beach, Bang Phra to Pattaya.

;Rail
A daily service operates on the Eastern Line of the State Railway of Thailand between Pattaya Station and Hualumphong Station in Bangkok.

;Bus
Pattaya is served by bus services from Bangkok&#x27;s Northern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit) and the Eastern Bus Terminal (Ekamai), connecting to Pattaya&#x27;s main bus terminal on Pattaya Nuea (North Pattaya Road) near Sukhumvit Road.

There are two airport bus services.
The 389 Bus (airportpattayabus) service connects Pattaya with Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK). It uses modern, air-conditioned buses, and takes around hours to reach the airport. The trip from the airport (Level 1 Gate 8 at the Arrival Hall) to the bus terminal in Pattaya, makes three stops at North, Central, and South Pattaya intersections before going to their last drop off point, the office on Thappraya Road (near Jomtien). It can take longer if many hotel stops are negotiated along Sukhumvit Road in Pattaya. The other bus service is the Bell Travel Service (Coach 36) which goes from the airport (Level 1 between Gate 7 &amp; 8) to the Pattaya Bell office at the North Pattaya Intersection, and then provides transfers to local hotels.

Buses from a terminal on Sukhumvit Road near Pattaya Klang (near the Central Pattaya intersection) connect Pattaya with many destinations in the north-east region (i.e. Isan).

City and suburban services are mainly provided by &quot;songthaew&quot;, popularly nicknamed &quot;baht buses&quot; or &quot;blue taxis&quot;.

;Air
Pattaya is about by road from Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK), the country&#x27;s largest international airport. By road, it is accessed from Sukhumvit Road and Motorway 7 from Bangkok. Pattaya is also served by scheduled flights via U-Tapao International Airport (UTP) which is 45-minute drive south of the city.

;Boat
A passenger-only ferry service from Pattaya to Hua Hin began operation on 12 January 2017 and is operated by Royal Passenger Liner. By road, the journey takes five to six hours. The ferry shortens travel time to about two hours, subject to sea conditions. The ferry cruises at 27 knots on the 113Â km journey across the Gulf of Thailand with a maximum passenger capacity of 150 persons. Larger ferries carrying up to 260 people may be added to the service later. Ferries capable of carrying vehicles are projected for 2020. In November 2018, Hua Hin deputy chief Chareewat Phramanee confirmed the ferry service, suspended due to low tourist numbers during low season, would be up and running again for high season between Hua Hin and Pattaya, a 2.5-hour journey for 1,250 baht on a catamaran with a maximum capacity of 340.

==Administration==

Pattaya city has been administered under a special autonomous system since 30 October 1978. It has a status comparable to a municipality and is separately administered by the mayor of Pattaya city who is responsible for making policies, organising public services, and supervising the city&#x27;s workforce for an area that covers 53.4 square kilometers and consists of four subdistricts, 18 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).

== Tourism ==


Once a fishing town, Pattaya first boomed as an R&amp;R destination for US servicemen stationed at nearby former USAF base at U-Tapao, or other US bases in Thailand during the Vietnam War. In 2018, Pattaya was the 18th most visited city in the world with 9.6 million tourists, and 3rd most in Thailand, after Bangkok (24.1 million) and Phuket (10.5 million).

== Festivals ==

* &quot;Chinese New Year&quot; (varies from late January to early February) is celebrated by Pattaya&#x27;s large Thai-Chinese community with dragons parades, lion dances, and fireworks.
* &quot;Pattaya International Music Festival&quot; is held annually in the month of March. It attracts huge crowds to the different stages along Beach Road and Bali Hai Pier, and presents several styles of music performed by Thai and international artists.
* The Pattaya Songkran festival, locally called &quot;Wan Lai&quot;, takes place each year in mid-April. It differs from most other Songkran festivals of Thailand in several aspects. It lasts several days longer and, besides water fights, the event includes beauty pageants, musical performances, cultural shows, fireworks, and water sports competitions.
* &quot;Top of the Gulf Regatta&quot; is a week-long sailing event held at the end of April, beginning of May.
* The &quot;Miss Tiffany Universe&quot; beauty pageant is held mid-May each year. During the four-day pageant, transgender models vie for first place with the final evening broadcast live on Thai TV for an audience of, on average, 15 million.

* &quot;Pattaya Classical Guitar Festival&quot;, held annually on the last weekend of October, organized by the Thailand Guitar Society, Pattaya People Media Group, and Siam Bayshore Pattaya.
* &quot;Loi Krathong&quot;, a light festival held during the full moon of the twelfth month in the traditional Thai lunar calendar and which usually falls in November, is celebrated in Pattaya, as in the rest of the country, that evening with people floating &quot;krathongs&quot; (small, candle-lit floats made from elaborately folded banana leaves) on the waters, as well as releasing &quot;khom loi&quot; (candle-fired hot air balloons) into the night sky.
* Every November Pattaya hosts Miss International Queen, a yearly international pageant for transgender persons and transsexuals. In 2007 the event drew an estimated 25 million viewers on national TV.

== Nightlife ==

Pattaya has derived part of its reputation as a tourist destination due to the sex industry and the resulting nightlife, and this notoriety has influenced the city&#x27;s evolution in many ways. Prostitution in Thailand is technically illegal but tolerated in most cities, including Pattaya. The city&#x27;s vast numbers of host bars, gogo bars, massage parlours, saunas, and hourly hotels, serve foreign tourists as well as locals. This is especially prominent on Walking Street as well as other areas around the city. Efforts have been made to clean up the city&#x27;s image.

An article in the British tabloid the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; have described Pattaya as &quot;the world&#x27;s sex capital&quot;, a &quot;modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;. This provoked anger from government officials as high up as Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha. Pol Col Apichai Krobpetch, the Pattaya police superintendent, denied that Pattaya is a sex trade paradise. Upset about the British media&#x27;s stories, he insisted they were fabricated. &quot;There is no such thing as prostitution in Pattaya,&quot; said Col Apichai. &quot;Where did they get the figure of 27,000 sex workers in Pattaya? Anyone can make up this information...Thai ladies having sex with foreigners is their personal issue. If they like each other, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with what they do behind closed doors.&quot; In response, Pattaya social worker Surang Janyam, the director of Service Workers IN Group Foundation, said that estimated number of Pattaya prostitutes published in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; is inaccurate: &quot;27,000 sex workers in Pattaya is way too low. We have a lot more sex workers than that.&quot; In June 2019, over twenty high ranking Police, Army and Local government officers toured Pattaya and reported the central streets safe and free from illegal activities.
As evidence of the government&#x27;s commitment to clean up Pattaya, on 26 February 2017 at 20:00, 60 police officers and soldiers raided Pattaya&#x27;s notorious Soi 6 to check for violations of the law. When the checks were completed, police announced that all licenses were in order and there was no law breaking of any kind, including prostitution, taking place there.

Pattaya also has Asia&#x27;s largest gay scene based around Boyztown, the Jomtien Complex, and Sunee Plaza. The city is also famous for its flamboyant &quot;kathoey&quot; cabaret shows where transgender entertainers perform to packed houses.

==Crime==
In recent years, Pattaya has served as a hideaway for foreigners with connections to organized crime in their home countries, and dozens have been murdered in gang-related disputes.

People who visit the Pattaya area may encounter petty crime, usually limited to pickpocketing and confidence tricks, particularly in and around major tourist areas such as Jomtien and Pattaya Beaches and on the &quot;baht buses&quot;. A special Tourist Police division has been established to aid tourists who are victims of crime. The 2009 British eight-episode TV documentary &quot;Big Trouble in Tourist Thailand&quot; described crimes involving tourists in Pattaya.

On 11 April 2009, Thailand&#x27;s Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared a state of emergency in the areas of Pattaya and Chonburi, in response to Red Shirt anti-government protesters breaking into the conference center of the Royal Cliff Beach Resort hotel complex, the site of an ASEAN Summit. The meeting was immediately cancelled and Asian leaders were evacuated, some by helicopter.

==Law==
In 2019, the International Thai Foundation (&#x27;ITF&#x27;) established a Community Legal Centre in Soi Bua Kao, Pattaya. Its objectives are to promote education, protect human rights &amp; relieve poverty for the people in Thailand. This is the third CLC in Thailand Pro Bono Community Hub in Chiang Mai.

== Media and communications ==
Several local foreign-language newspapers and magazines are published either weekly or monthly, especially in English, Russian, and German. The English-language newspapers include the &quot;Pattaya Mail&quot; and &quot;Pattaya People&quot;. The Pattaya News is an online portal that writes the local news in six languages. &quot;DER FARANG&quot; is a German-language newspaper published every 14 days. &quot;Thailands Tidende&quot; is a Norwegian-language newspaper published monthly.

== In popular media ==
The novel &quot;Platform&quot; by French author Michel Houellebecq prominently features the city of Pattaya as well as its nightlife.

The GMMTV Boys&#x27; Love (BL) series &quot;Moonlight Chicken&quot; (2023) is set in Pattaya.

==Education==
International schools in Pattaya:
* Ãcole francophone de Pattaya
* International School of Chonburi
* Tara Pattana International School
* Rugby School Thailand
* Mooltripakdee International School Pattaya
* Hastin International School
The Thai-Japanese Association School Sriracha, a Japanese international school, is in nearby Si Racha. It is an affiliate of the Thai-Japanese Association School in Bangkok. Si Racha formerly housed the Sriracha-Pattaya Japanese Supplement School, a Japanese weekend school.

<doc id="712801" wikidata="Q1194236" url="?curid=712801" title="Cannonball (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Samuel Zachary Guthrie is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod, the character first appeared in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #4 (September 1982). Guthrie belongs to the subspecies of humans called mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. He possesses the power to fly at jet speeds while encased in an impenetrable force field. He is known under the codename Cannonball.

The eldest of a large Kentucky coal mining family, Samuel Guthrie is a founding member of the X-Men&#x27;s junior team, the New Mutants. Several of his siblings are also mutants who have joined X-Men-related teams. Guthrie served as X-Force&#x27;s second-in-command and field leader, eventually joining the X-Men as the first member of a secondary team to &quot;graduate&quot; to the main team. He was also a member of the Avengers.

Since his original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise. Charlie Heaton portrayed Sam Guthrie in the 2020 film &quot;The New Mutants&quot; (2020).

==Publication history==
Samuel Guthrie debuted as a member of the New Mutants in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #4 (September 1982), created by Chris Claremont and artist Bob McLeod. McLeod later commented, &quot;I always liked Cannonball the best [of the New Mutants]. I tried to give all the mutants distinct body types and characteristics, and with his big ears and lanky frame, he was just the most fun to draw.&quot;

After a guest appearance in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; # 167, the character appeared regularly in the title &quot;The New Mutants&quot; from its first issue to its hundredth issue (1983â1991), and continued to appear in its replacement title &quot;X-Force&quot; (1991). In &quot;X-Force&quot; # 44 (1995), Guthrie leaves X-Force to join the X-Men, appearing regularly in &quot;X-Men&quot; #48â89 and &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #323â355 (1995â1998). He rejoins his friends in X-Force while on an extended road trip in &quot;X-Force&quot; # 86 (1998), and stays with the team through issue # 117 (2001), after which the title changes drastically, taken over by the team later to be known as &quot;X-Statix&quot;.

Guthrie next appears as a member of the &quot;X-Corporation&quot; in &quot;New X-Men&quot; #128, 130, 131 and 140 (2002â2003), and then rejoins the X-Men in a splinter team led by Storm in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #24â46 (2003â2004). After the cancellation of &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;, Guthrie appears regularly with the X-Men in the mid to late 2000s, including &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #444â447 (2004) and #466â474 (2006), &quot;X-Men&quot; #188â204 (2006â2007), &quot;Young X-Men&quot; #1â6 (2008) and &quot;Secret Invasion: X-Men&quot; #1â4 (2009). He and Sunspot also appear in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #1â6 (2009).

In 2009, &quot;New Mutants&quot; was relaunched in its third volume, penned by Zeb Wells, though in this incarnation they were a strike team of X-Men with a defined roster, including Mirage, Karma, Sunspot, Magma, Magik, Cypher and Warlock. Guthrie appears as a regular from issue #1 through #25 (2009â2011). The New Mutants were a major fixture in the Second Coming event, in which Guthrie and his team appear in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #523â524, &quot;X-Force&quot; #36 and &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; #234â235 (2010).

Guthrie would be featured during &quot;Second Coming&quot; in the &quot;X-Men: Hellbound&quot; miniseries #1â3 (2010), leading the team of Pixie, Gambit, Anole, Dazzler, Trance and Northstar to Limbo to rescue Magik.

In the Age of X event, Guthrie suffered mental trauma as the field leader of a bastion under constant siege, causing him to leave the New Mutants in &quot;X-Regenesis&quot; #1 (2011) and &quot;New Mutants&quot; #25 vol. 3 (2011). He would leave the X-Men&#x27;s base on Utopia to join Wolverine&#x27;s faction at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning in New York, joining Rogue&#x27;s team in &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; #260.1-#267 (2012).

Guthrie and Sunspot were asked by Captain America to join the Avengers, bridging the gap between humans and mutants in the aftermath of the Avengers vs. X-Men event. He appears in &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 5 #1â23 (2013) and #38â44 (2015), &quot;Avengers World&quot; #1â18 (2014â2015), &quot;U.S. Avengers&quot; #1â12 (2017), and &quot;Avengers&quot; #675â690 (2018) during the &quot;No Surrender&quot; event.

He later rejoined the X-Men in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; vol. 5 #1 (2018) and remains in regular publication in that title.

Guthrie appeared in the &quot;New Mutants: War Children&quot; one-shot (2019).

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
Samuel Guthrie was born in Cumberland, Kentucky. As a child, he tried to support his family by working in the coal mine where his father had worked before his death. While attempting to rescue a fellow worker, Mr. Lewis, from a collapsing mine shaft, Sam&#x27;s mutant ability unintentionally manifested, saving both of them. Subsequently, Sam was recruited by Donald Pierce of the Hellfire Club to attack the New Mutants. When ordered to kill the defeated New Mutants, Sam defied Pierce and was later invited by Charles Xavier to join the New Mutants, adopting the alias &quot;Cannonball.&quot;

===New Mutants===
As a member of the New Mutants, Guthrie forms a close friendship with his teammate Sunspot and develops a brotherly affection for Rahne, unaware for some time that she harbors romantic feelings for him.

Guthrie, alongside Moonstar, serves as co-leader of the New Mutants and supervises teammates including Magik, Karma, Cypher, Magma, and Warlock. He leads the team through various adventures across time and space, from ancient Scotland to distant galaxies. During one of these adventures, he starts a romantic relationship with the mutant rock musician Lila Cheney.

The Beyonder encounters the New Mutants and kills them, but they are resurrected soon after. This traumatic experience deeply unsettles the team, leading them to join the Hellions at Emma Frost&#x27;s Massachusetts Academy, though they later reassess their decision.

Wolfsbane, Warlock, Rictor, and Boom Boom are kidnapped from the grounds of the X-Mansion by Genoshan forces under Cameron Hodge. Warlock is killed by Hodge in an attempt to steal his powers. Guthrie joins the X-Men in a rescue mission that leads to the overthrow of Genosha&#x27;s government, while Rahne remains behind to assist the victims of Genosha&#x27;s regime.

===X-Force===
Guthrie and the New Mutants leave the supervision of the X-Men. They join forces with Cable to form the hard-edged team X-Force, with Guthrie appointed as the team&#x27;s second-in-command and field leader. During a confrontation with the Brotherhood of Mutants, Guthrie is impaled and killed but heals within minutes. Cable reveals that he is from a dystopian future ruled by Apocalypse and believes Cannonball to be an External, a rare type of mutant who is virtually immortal. Other Externals, including Saul and Gideon, come to believe that Guthrie is one of them. Around this time, it is also revealed that Guthrie&#x27;s sister, Paige, possesses mutant powers.

Guthrie&#x27;s tenure with X-Force is marked by significant challenges, as the team is viewed as &quot;out of line&quot; by the X-Men and is considered outright criminal by S.H.I.E.L.D., leading to a conflict with a S.H.I.E.L.D. team led by Nick Fury. Despite these tensions, Sam plays a crucial role in reconciling rivalries and assists the X-Men, particularly Forge and Wolfsbane, in defeating the Phalanx.

===X-Men===
Guthrie later rejoins the X-Men, initially with great enthusiasm but soon begins to question his abilities. He confronts these doubts during a battle against the Shi&#x27;ar Gladiator, where he fights the opponent to a standstill.
Guthrie&#x27;s relationship with Tabitha becomes strained, leading her to seek &quot;support&quot; from Guthrie&#x27;s best friend, Sunspot. Subsequently, Guthrie leaves the X-Men to care for his ailing mother. During his time with the X-Men, he also infiltrates the presidential campaign of anti-mutant candidate Graydon Creed under the alias &quot;Samson Guthry.&quot; Despite the obviousness of the alias, Sam remains undetected until Creed is assassinated on the eve of the election.

Guthrie rejoins X-Force, which has relocated to San Francisco, and becomes the team leader following Siryn&#x27;s injury. Although Cable has departed, the team finds a new mentor in Pete Wisdom, who introduces them to espionage. Guthrie and Tabitha reconcile during this period. After Wisdom&#x27;s alleged death, Guthrie resumes leadership of the team and strives to continue Wisdom&#x27;s mission. Eventually, Guthrie and the other X-Force members are forced to fake their own deaths.

===Back to basics===
Storm invites Guthrie to join her team, the X-Treme X-Men, which operates independently of Professor X&#x27;s leadership. The team eventually reverts to the central X-Men roster. After sustaining injuries on a mission, Guthrie opts for a period of respite and retreats to his farm, which he purchased with his X-Corporation earnings. While on the farm, he reunites with Cable and the reformed X-Force to combat the threat posed by the Skornn.

Guthrie rejoins the active roster of the X-Men, co-led by Nightcrawler and Bishop, and takes on a role overseeing the younger students at the X-Mansion. He also serves as a member of the X-Treme Sanctions Executive (XSE), participating in efforts such as aiding the 198 and battling the Shi&#x27;ar Death Commandos. Guthrie experiences personal tragedy with the death of his brother Jay, who is killed by William Stryker. In &quot;The First Foursaken&quot; story arc, Guthrie travels with the X-Men to Central Park, where they confront the Foursaken, who capture and relocate them. After their escape, Guthrie joins the X-Men in Africa to assist Storm in aiding mutant refugees.

===Rogue&#x27;s team===
Guthrie serves on Rogue&#x27;s team of X-Men. Following a battle with the Hecatomb and Rogue&#x27;s severe mental injury, the team retreats to Rogue&#x27;s childhood home for rest. They are soon attacked by the Marauders, who are seeking Destiny&#x27;s Diaries. During the attack, Emma Frost, who had been attempting to assist Rogue, is incapacitated by a neurotoxin. She uploads what she has gathered from the Marauders&#x27; psi-shielding into Guthrie&#x27;s mind and takes partial control of his body. While aboard the Blackbird, the team is engaged midair by Sunfire, who severely damages the jet. Guthrie escapes and confronts Shiro, who reveals that he killed Cable. Guthrie dismisses the claim, stating that he would &quot;still be sayin&#x27; &#x27;show me the body.&#x27;&quot;

Guthrie and Iceman work to recover the Destiny Diaries, which are concealed in a dilapidated brewery. During their mission, they are attacked by the Marauders, and Guthrie sustains serious injuries. Dr. Henry McCoy assesses his condition, noting that Guthrie&#x27;s brain scan shows sluggish and irregular activity. Despite this, Guthrie rapidly recovers and is able to participate in the final battle against the Marauders.

===Divided We Stand===
After Cyclops disbands the X-Men, Guthrie returns home. His sister Paige picks him up at the airport, overjoyed to see him, but Sam is moody and withdrawn. When Paige confronts him about his demeanor, Guthrie reacts angrily, blasting off into the sky and expressing regret about coming home.

===Manifest Destiny===
Guthrie is soon contacted by Cyclops, who informs him that the X-Men are reforming in San Francisco. Guthrie agrees to join the new team and arrives in the city just as Magneto is attacking with a group of antique Sentinels. Guthrie manages to charge into Magneto, disabling his artificial magnetism suit and giving the X-Men a strategic advantage in the battle, though Magneto ultimately escapes. Later, Guthrie is seen at a bar with Karma and Moonstar, expressing his disillusionment with the notion of changing the world. Instead, he finds purpose in preventing others from experiencing the loss he endured with his brother Jay&#x27;s death. He is subsequently called upon to assist with dealing with Empath.

===Reforming the New Mutants===
After receiving an anonymous tip about a young mutant threatening a small town in Colorado, Moonstar and Karma are sent to investigate and reassure the locals. Meanwhile, Magik reappears at the X-Men&#x27;s base in San Francisco after having teleported into the future following the events of &quot;X-Infernus.&quot; She warns Guthrie and Sunspot that Moonstar and Karma are in grave danger and that their situation could lead to their deaths. Guthrie, Sunspot, Magma, and Magik set out to locate them. They eventually find Karma unconscious and are deceived into freeing Legion.

In Legion&#x27;s mind, various personalities seek to kill Moonstar because she could help bring them under control. Legion finds Moonstar in a jail cell and is about to kill her when Guthrie intervenes. Moonstar urges Guthrie to release her, but he refuses, arguing that she will be safer in the cell due to her lack of powers. Guthrie and Sunspot then leave to confront Legion, unaware that one of Legion&#x27;s personalities, capable of projecting himself, is delaying them while preparing to kill Moonstar. Magik and Magma arrive in time to stop Legion and free Moonstar, who is determined to take action. She returns armed with numerous firearms and declares that they are going after Legion. Guthrie tells Moonstar she should leave, insisting she is no longer a mutant and should stop pretending, especially since one of the most powerful mutants wants her dead. Upset, Moonstar drives away but returns shortly after seeing that Guthrie and the New Mutants have been badly beaten. After Legion is captured, Sam tries to apologize, but Moonstar limps away, ignoring him. Guthrie later confesses to Cyclops that he feels he has failed, but Cyclops reassures him that keeping everyone alive is what truly matters.

In the aftermath of Utopia, Scott reveals to Moonstar that Guthrie did not select her for his team, which leaves her deeply upset and angry. This revelation leads to a confrontation between Moonstar and Guthrie, but they eventually reach an understanding, and Guthrie allows Moonstar to join the team. Later, during a discussion about Sam&#x27;s past romantic relationships, particularly with Lila Cheney, Guthrie and Moonstar share a kiss, which is interrupted by the rest of the team.

===Regenesis===
Wolverine hires Guthrie to work at his new school, where he teaches a course on flying. For students without natural flying abilities, jetpacks are provided. During this period, Sam makes a point of checking in on his sister, Husk, who works full-time at the school and expresses concern about her mental well-being.

As part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event, Guthrie becomes a member of the Avengers alongside Sunspot. Eight months into the future, he is depicted living on an alien planet within the Shi&#x27;ar empire with Izzy Kane and their child.

===U.S.Avengers===
Guthrie joins the U.S. Avengers, and their inaugural mission involves confronting the Secret Empire&#x27;s floating volcanic island base. They are subsequently visited by a future version of Danielle Cage as Captain America, who warns them that her nemesis, the Golden Skull, has traveled to their timeline to steal the world&#x27;s wealth. The U.S. Avengers defeat and capture the Golden Skull, after which Moonstarelle returns him to her own timeline.

During the &quot;Opening Salvo&quot; segment of the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Guthrie decides to leave the U.S. Avengers to spend time with his wife and son. However, upon returning to Earth, he encounters the Alpha Flight Space Program, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Ultimates in their battle against the Chitauri. Guthrie joins the fight but is presumed dead when a Chitauri dragon consumes Quasar and subsequently explodes. He is later discovered by an alien and sold at auction on an alien planet to a mysterious human named Howard Mason, who transports him to a small Earth-like town on the alien planet. Guthrie&#x27;s wife eventually informs Sunspot that Guthrie is alive on another planet.

While traveling through space, Guthrie is introduced to the townspeople by Ritchie Redwood, the ruler of the planet. Upon realizing the troublesome nature of the inhabitants, Guthrie attempts to escape but is captured and imprisoned. In the dungeon, he encounters other prisoners, including a teenager named Bugface. Guthrie orchestrates a prison break, and they set out to overthrow Ritchie. During the ensuing battle, Smasher and the U.S. Avengers arrive to provide assistance. After Ritchie and his army are imprisoned, the heroes return home.

==Powers and abilities==
Samuel Guthrie possesses the ability to bodily generate thermo-chemical energy and release it from his skin. This energy is used as thrust to cause his body to be propelled through the air like a rocket, at great heights and speeds with considerable maneuverability. He can control his speed and direction through sheer act of will. At first, he could only release this energy from his feet and legs, but now he can fire it from almost any part of his body, to a wide variety of effects. This energy also manifests itself as an impenetrable and virtually indestructible &quot;blast field&quot; that protects him from bodily harm. Guthrie can use this blast-field for the following effects: to function as a personal shield or extending it to encompass others, to shape the field around another person to imprison them, or to absorb outside kinetic impact into his own energy supply, enabling him to increase the bludgeoning power of his blows or to create explosive shock waves upon impact. His power levels have varied over the years â but at his peak, he has been able to absorb (and redirect) the force of one of Gladiator&#x27;s punches.

Furthermore, Guthrie may also be a member of the immortal mutant group the Externals, due to his apparent ability to return to life after death.

==Reception==
&quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; noted that Samuel Guthrie gained significant popularity in the 1980s as he appeared alongside Magik and Moonstar in &quot;New Mutants&quot;. George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; named Samuel Guthrie one of the best members of the X-Men. Matthew Monagle of &quot;ScreenCrush&quot; called Samuel Guthrie a fan favorite. Eric Diaz of &quot;Nerdist&quot; said that although Samuel Guthrie was initially portrayed with a &quot;aw, shucks&quot; Southern stereotype, he eventually transcended this image to become one of the X-Men universe&#x27;s most popular characters, describing him as the &quot;big lug with a heart of gold&quot; and highlighting that he serves as the emotional core of the team.

Guthrie allows Cable to escape with the child, opting to stay and distract Bishop. Bishop pleads with Sam not to fight, but Guthrie persists, harboring a decades-long grudge against the traitorous former X-Man, and after a long fight, Bishop is forced to kill him using a claw-like tentacle from his new bionic arm (stolen from Forge) to rip out Guthrie&#x27;s heart.

<doc id="712822" wikidata="Q1027729" url="?curid=712822" title="Calvin S. Brice">
<text>Calvin Stewart Brice (September 17, 1845 â December 15, 1898) was an American businessman and Democratic politician from Ohio. He is best remembered for his single term in the United States Senate, his role as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and his formative role in the American rail industry. He was a leading Bourbon Democrat.

==Early life==
Calvin Brice was born on September 17, 1845, to William Kirkpatrick and Elizabeth Stewart Brice in Denmark, Ohio. His father was a Presbyterian minister of no great wealth. He was home-schooled for a time before entering the Columbus Grove public school system in Putnam County. After showing some promise as a student, Brice gained admission to Miami University in 1859.

Brice&#x27;s first attempt to join the army in 1861 met with little success, after being turned down because of his young age. In the summer of 1862, however, Brice enlisted and served three months in the 86th Regiment of the Ohio Volunteer Infantry, seeing action in West Virginia. In 1863, he returned to and graduated from Miami University with high honors and worked as a schoolmaster, before he joined the army again in 1864, this time serving as captain to a company of volunteers he recruited for the 180th Ohio Infantry. Brice rose rapidly through the ranks of the Union Army and, by the end of the war, attained the position of Lieutenant-Colonel.

With &quot;no desire for an army career,&quot; according to historian Thomas Mach, Brice ended his military career soon after to pursue a career in law. He earned his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1865 and passed the Ohio bar in 1866.

==Business career==
Brice found his break into both the business and political worlds under unusual circumstances. Around 1880, with his law practice proving unsuccessful and his mother&#x27;s home at risk of foreclosure, Brice offered to attend to any legal interests with which the mortgage lender needed help. The lender, then-Governor Charles Foster, declined the legal help but offered to pay Brice five hundred dollars to negotiate a business deal with Wall Street on his behalf. Brice accepted and proved a shrewd businessman; Ignoring Foster&#x27;s explicit instructions for his work on the business proceedings in New York and instead following his instincts, Brice returned with a shocking profit of $40,000 and earned the trust and friendship of the Governor. Foster would later name Brice &quot;the most remarkable man [he] ever met [â¦] the most successful borrower [he] ever saw.&quot; Throughout his business career, two themes were consistent: Brice&#x27;s ability to restructure a failing or fledgling business to turn a profit and his involvement with Charles Foster, whose support was crucial to Brice&#x27;s success.

After working in private practice, Brice joined the legal department of the Lake Erie and Louisville Railroad. There, he gained his initial experience in the railroad industry, learning how to operate, fund, and expand a rail network. In 1871, Brice traveled to Europe to secure funding for a foundering railway running from Toledo to Ohio&#x27;s coal fields, impressing Foster once more. With Foster&#x27;s support, Brice guided the railroad through the Panic of 1873 and expanded it into Lima and the surrounding region. His most notable achievement was perhaps his role in the 1882 construction of the Nickel Plate Road which ran from New York to St. Louis. He later sold this road for a generous profit to William Henry Vanderbilt, who recognized it as a dangerous competitor. Brice rose to President of the company in 1887, which by then was known as the Lake Erie and Western Railroad.

Over time, Brice netted a great fortune, laying claim to ten different railroads while spreading into numerous other businesses, including the National Telegraph Company and the Chase National Bank of New York.

Later in life, Brice became involved with railroad projects in China. He was a founding member of the American Asiatic Association, an organization responsible for pursuing American trade interests in China under the Open Door Policy. In the late 1890s, he began an attempt to build a railroad between Canton and Hankou on mainland China, but he died before the project was completed.

Throughout his career, Brice remained selfless in his aims and frugal in his desires, unlike most of the so-called robber barons of his day. According to historian James White, Brice did not accept much compensation for his services during a business transaction and often held himself accountable to the public by &quot;stripping a proposition of every incumbrance and laying it bare for inspection.&quot;

==Political career==

Alongside his business career, Brice played an increasing role in state and national politics. He was a conservative Bourbon Democrat. Brice got his start in politics as an elector for Samuel J. Tilden in 1876 and later worked for the successful 1884 presidential campaign of Grover Cleveland.

===DNC Chair===
After Cleveland&#x27;s election, Brice became more active in the Democratic Party and was elected as a delegate-at-large to the 1888 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis. In 1889, Brice was chosen to replace the late William H. Barnum as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. His wealth and connections made him an influential party chairman, earning him the nickname &quot;Calvin $ellars Brice&quot;.
He served until 1892, when was replaced in that position by William Harrity of Pennsylvania after expressing doubts about nominating Grover Cleveland for a third time.

===U.S. Senator===
In 1890, Brice won the nomination over John A. McMahon as his party&#x27;s candidate to succeed George H. Payne, the outgoing U.S. Senator from Ohio. Brice was subject to media criticism, including over claims that he was not an Ohio resident, having lived in New York in the previous years. Heavy campaign spending secured the election of a Democratic majority to the Ohio General Assembly, enabling Brice&#x27;s selection. Because of suspicious circumstances deriving from Payne&#x27;s initial selection, though, Brice was scrutinized by the Senate before assuming office.

Although Brice enacted few memorable measures as Senator, he gained a reputation as a hard-working and intelligent member, serving as Chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and member of the Democratic Steering Committee and Committee on Appropriations.

Brice&#x27;s reversal on the critical issue of tariff reform cost him the support of many in his Democratic base. Brice&#x27;s strong ties to New York businesses led some in Ohio to call him &quot;New York&#x27;s Third Senator&quot;. Though Brice fended off a censure motion at the 1894 Democratic party state convention, he lost his bid for reelection to Republican Joseph B. Foraker three years later. After his defeat, Brice dropped out of Ohio politics.

==Death==
He died suddenly and unexpectedly in New York City of an acute attack of pneumonia on December 15, 1898.

==Legacy==
The mining town of Briceville, Tennessee, which he proved instrumental in helping to connect to railroad service, is named for him.

Brice was a devoted alumnus of Miami University later in life. His efforts in 1885 and 1888 to provide funding for the university were largely responsible for its survival, and a science building, Brice Hall was named in his honor. It has since been demolished.

<doc id="712823" wikidata="Q2906219" url="?curid=712823" title="Robert Harbin">
<text>Robert Harbin (born Edward Richard Charles Williams; 12 February 1908 â 12 January 1978) was a South African-born magician and author. He is noted as the inventor of a number of classic illusions, including the &quot;Zig Zag Girl&quot;. He also became an authority on origami.

==Career==
The young Edward first got interested in magic after an unknown ex-serviceman appeared at his school with a magic show later described as &quot;rather poor&quot;. Williams came to London at the age of 20 and began by working in the magic department of Gamages toy shop. He began performing in music halls under the title &quot;Ned Williams, the Boy Magician from South Africa&quot;. By 1932 he was appearing in the &quot;Maskelyne&#x27;s Mysteries&quot; magic show in various London theatres. He was the first British illusionist to move from stage performing to television, appearing in the BBC TV show &quot;Variety&quot; in 1937 and numerous times after the war when the BBC resumed broadcasting. He developed a number of new tricks, including the &quot;Neon Light&quot; and the now ubiquitous &quot;Zig Zag Girl&quot;. His lesser known inventions include the &quot;Aztec Lady&quot;, The Blades of Opah, and Aunt Matilda&#x27;s Wardrobe.

Much of his inventive genius was put into written form and he is known as one of the most prodigious authors on the subject of magical effects. However, although Harbin was brilliantly creative in the field of magic he was not a particularly good writer and his friend and associate Eric C Lewis has stated that many of Harbin&#x27;s titles were ghost written for him.

In 1953 Harbin appeared in a minor part as a magician in the film &quot;The Limping Man&quot;, produced by Cy Endfield. In 1953, Harbin and a friend of Endfield, Gershon Legman (1917â1999), discovered a common interest in the Japanese art of paper-folding. Harbin wrote many books on the subject, beginning with &quot;Paper Magic&quot; (illustrated by the young art student, the Australian Rolf Harris who in the middle of the project, caught the origami idea and contributed several intricate models himself) in 1956, and was the first President of the British Origami Society. He was the first Westerner to use the word origami for this art-form. He also presented a series of origami programmes for ITV in its &quot;Look-In&quot; magazines for children in the 1970s.
There is a commemorative plaque dedicated to Harbin at Golders Green Crematorium in London.

<doc id="712824" wikidata="Q2351095" url="?curid=712824" title="St. Joseph Valley Parkway">
<text>The St. Joseph Valley Parkway is a freeway in the U.S. states of Indiana and Michigan, serving as a bypass route around Elkhart, Mishawaka, and South Bend in Indiana and Niles in Michigan. The freeway runs to the south and west of Elkhart and South Bend and Niles and consists of segments of U.S. Route 31 (USÂ 31) and USÂ 20; those two highway designations run concurrently at the southwestern rim of the South Bend metropolitan area. It continues north to run along the St. Joseph River valley.

The freeway was first built in Indiana in the 1960s, although plans in Michigan date back to the 1950s. Indiana completed its portion of the freeway in 1992, while Michigan opened its last segment in 2022.

==Route description==

The Parkway begins where USÂ 20 expands to a divided highway southeast of Elkhart. To the east in Indiana the freeway feeds into an undivided segment of USÂ 20 at County Road 17 (CRÂ 17). From there it runs westward along the south sides of Elkhart and Mishawaka. South of South Bend, USÂ 31 joins the Parkway, and then the Parkway turns northward along the west side of South Bend. Along this segment, USÂ 20 turns back west and leaves the Parkway. The Parkway meets the Indiana Toll Road which carries I-80/I-90 before crossing the state line into Michigan. West of Niles, the Parkway meets USÂ 12 and continues northwesterly running west of Berrien Springs. From there it runs northward to end at I-94 east of Benton Harbor.

The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) and the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) both maintain the sections of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway in their respective states. Additionally, both departments have listed their freeway segments as part of the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. The two departments conduct surveys to measure the traffic levels along their roadways. This measurement is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT) which is a calculation of the traffic volume on a stretch of roadway for any average day of the year. INDOT&#x27;s figures for 2007 showed that 30,753Â vehicles used the freeway near its western end. The traffic volume drops to 19,914Â vehicles near the Indiana Toll Road. In Michigan, the levels drop as low as 7,402Â vehicles near the Napier Road interchange.

==History==

===Name===
The &quot;St. Joseph Valley Parkway&quot; name was chosen by local chambers of commerce in the fall of 1992 as the result of a local contest held by a group of local businesses. The name was officially adopted by Michigan in 1993 (dedicated late 1995) and Indiana in 1995 (dedicated in mid-1995).

===Indiana section===
There had been a southern bypass of the South Bend and Elkhart areas planned since the 1930s. The first section of the highway, started in 1958 as Bypass USÂ 20 (BYP USÂ 20), was completed between USÂ 20 and Mayflower Road (at the time State RoadÂ 123) on September 19, 1963. The freeway was extended to just past the SRÂ 23 interchange in late Summer 1965, then further east to USÂ 31, that section opening on December 15, 1967. The BYP USÂ 20 designation was replaced by the USÂ 31 designation in 1978. The exit with the Indiana EastâWest Toll Road/I-80/I-90 was built beginning in 1979 in conjunction with the northern extension to Michigan. Construction in the early 1990s extended the freeway in sections from USÂ 31/Business USÂ 31 (Bus. USÂ 31) to its current end with USÂ 20 at CRÂ 17, with the portion from USÂ 31/Bus. USÂ 31 to SRÂ 19 opening on December 11, 1991, and the portion from there to CRÂ 17 opening on October 9, 1992. Ramps from Nimtz Parkway were opened November 3, 1997, and the portion in Elkhart was also named the &quot;Dean R. Mock Expressway&quot; in March 2002.

===Michigan section===
A plan to relocate USÂ 31 in Berrien County, Michigan, existed as early as 1952. Planning to extend the South Bend Bypass northward into Michigan to I-96 (later I-196) began in 1962. A report issued in 1970 detailed four routing corridors, spawning a lawsuit over how Berrien Springs would be bypassed. Construction was to begin in 1975, but the Michigan State Highways Department delayed construction plans in 1972, pushing the start to 1977. The first section, running from the state line north to USÂ 12, was completed and dedicated August 10, 1979, and opened to traffic by September 6 of that year. From there, USÂ 31 was routed east along USÂ 12 to Bus. USÂ 12 and north along Bus. USÂ 12 to the former routing of USÂ 31/US 33. Final plans for the routing north to I-94 were approved in 1981. The Niles bypass section was opened August 16, 1987, bringing the freeway north to Walton Road northwest of Niles. Bus. USÂ 31 was created along the former routing in Niles and Walton Road was rebuilt as a state trunkline connection between the northern end of the freeway and the former two-lane routing of USÂ 31. The Berrien Springs bypass section was opened in late 1992, the southbound lanes opening on October 23 and the northbound on November 20. As a cost-saving measure, this section was initially an expressway with crossroads, and was converted to a freeway in stages through 1999. Since then, MDOT built a freeway segment north to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27, 2003 at a cost of $97 million (equivalent to $ in ). A proposed spur westward to I-94 in the Stevensville area was never built.

====Extension to I-94====

East of Benton Harbor, Michigan, the St. Joseph Valley Parkway extension was under study due to environmental, economical and historical site issues. One of the environmental concerns relates to the habitat of an endangered species, the Mitchell&#x27;s satyr butterfly that has its habitat in the area of the freeway extension. The habitat is home to the second-largest population of the rare butterfly. This freeway connection was originally approved in 1981 as part of a final environmental impact study that included the freeway built from Niles northward to Napier Avenue. Since that approval, the butterfly was discovered in the Blue Creek Fen in the late 1980s, and it was listed an endangered species in 1992. The listing stalled construction of the freeway north of Berrien Springs. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued an opinion two years later that the freeway project would jeopardize the species. MDOT was given permission to modify the previously approved freeway to cross the Blue Creek on longer bridges; the USFWS also required that any construction be done from elevated platforms, among other restrictions. In the interim, MDOT proceeded with construction of the southern portion of the last freeway segment, completing the freeway northward from Berrien Springs to the Napier Avenue interchange in August 2003.

A revised environmental impact study to account for the butterfly&#x27;s habitat was approved in 2004. The study compared the original proposal for this extension that involved connecting directly to I-196 at I-94 with a pair of alternate routes that involved connecting USÂ 31 directly to BL I-94 at I-94 near Benton Harbor with auxiliary lanes to I-196. The recommendation was to use the PA-2 version of the alternative connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen. At the time the last freeway segment was opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but funding was not available for many years. Construction of the extension was not included for this reason in subsequent MDOT five-year highway projects plans, although most of the design work and land acquisition was identified in 2013 as having been finished. Funding for the project was listed in the 2017â21 plan draft released in July 2016, which split the remaining work into three phases. MDOT received a federal grant for the project in December 2018, citing at that time a completion date of 2022 or 2023 for the project; construction began in June 2020. The ribbon cutting for this section occurred on September 26, 2022. The new routing to I-94 formally opened on November 9, 2022. Until the freeway was completed, USÂ 31 followed a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. This stretch of Napier remained state trunkline until 2023. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name was applied to the new freeway section.

<text>Barrow Association Football Club is a professional football club based in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England. The club competes in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. 

Having initially played in the Lancashire Combination, Barrow joined the Football League in 1921. They remained in the bottom level of the competition until 1967, when they achieved promotion to the Third Division by finishing third in the Fourth Division. The club&#x27;s highest league placing was in 1967â68, when they finished eighth in the Third Division. They declined quickly, however, and at the end of the 1971â72 season Barrow were voted out of the Football League in the re-election process. They then spent 48 seasons in the top two levels of non-League football, with five relegations fromâand promotions toâthe Alliance Premier League (later the Football Conference and the National League), of which they were a founding member in 1979. Barrow won the FA Trophy (non-League football&#x27;s most prestigious cup competition) in 1990 and 2010. They returned to the Football League as National League champions in 2020. Barrow&#x27;s promotion return to the Football League made them the first, and to date only, club to have been automatically promoted to the Football League having previously lost their league place via the re-election process, although a number of clubs had previously lost and regained their league status via re-election.

The club colours are blue and white and their nickname is The Bluebirds. Since 1909, Barrow have played their home games at Holker Street near the town centre, from Barrow-in-Furness railway station. The record attendance at Holker Street is 16,874, for a FA Cup third round fixture against Swansea Town in 1954.

==History==

===Early history===
Barrow were founded on 16 July 1901 at the old Drill Hall (later the Palais) in the Strand, and played initially at the Strawberry Ground before moving to Ainslie Street and Little Park in Roose. The club was elected to Division Two of the Lancashire Combination in 1903, and in 1908 it was promoted to the first division. Barrow moved to Holker Street the following year, where they still play. The club remained in the Lancashire Combination until (and after) the First World War, winning the league championship in 1920â21. The victory preceded the formation of the Football League Third Division North in the 1921â22 season, and Barrow became one of the league&#x27;s founding members.

===Football League years===
In their early years as a league club, Barrow were notable for their lack of success. Their highest finish before the Second World War was fifth in the 1931â32 season. In the 1933â34 season, Barrow finished eighth. The club remained in the lowest tier of the Football League when football resumed after the war, and were founding members of Football League Division Four in 1958â59. The 1950s saw greater success in FA Cup competition, however; the club&#x27;s record crowd of 16,874 watched Barrow draw 2â2 with Swansea Town in the 1953â54 FA Cup. A few years later, it was followed by a third-round tie in the 1958â59 competition against Football League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers at Holker Street. The Wolves, captained by Billy Wright, won 4â2.

The late 1960s finally saw Barrow win promotion, after a third-place finish managed by Don McEvoy in the 1966â67 Fourth Division. McEvoy&#x27;s successor, Colin Appleton, led Barrow to their highest final league position (eighth place) in the Football League Third Division the following season. The club topped the Third Division league table for one day during the 1968â69 season, the highest position they have ever held. During this period, defender Brian Arrowsmith made the most Football League appearances for Barrow. Barrow remained in the third flight of English football for three seasons, before returning to the basement in 1970. Financial difficulties and poor performances saw Barrow twice up for re-election in 1971 and 1972. On the second occasion, at the end of the 1971â72 season, they were voted out of the Football League and replaced by Hereford United. The initial vote produced saw a tie between Barrow and Hereford for the last place in the league, with each receiving 26 votes. However a second vote saw Hereford win with 29 votes to Barrow&#x27;s 20. Three factors were highlighted: Barrow&#x27;s geographic isolation, Hereford United&#x27;s FA Cup victory against Newcastle United, and the decision of the Barrow board to introduce a speedway track around the Holker Street pitch to offset financial difficulties. Barrow joined the Northern Premier League for the start of the 1972â73 season, and the club spent 51 years in the Football League, 44 playing seasons due to the wartime closedown.

===Return to non-League competition===
To gain access to the Northern Premier League, the club had to promise to remove the speedway track from Holker Street (although it remained until 1974). Barrow struggled in the league, with limited financial resources. The club were invited to join the new Alliance Premier League in 1979, the first national division in non-League football. Barrow won the Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy in 1981 (their first success as a non-League club since winning the Lancashire Combination in 1921), but were relegated two years later. They won the Northern Premier League title the following season under manager Vic Halom, but were relegated again by 1986. The club hired Ray Wilkie as a manager just before relegation, and Wilkie led Barrow to their most successful period to date in non-League football.

After a number of near-misses, the club did promote to the renamed Football Conference in 1988â89 after their Northern Premier League championship. Driven by Colin Cowperthwaite, holder of club records for appearances and goals, Barrow had two respectable finishes in the Conference: 10th in 1989â90 and 14th the following season. In addition to league success, Wilkie had a number of successful cup runs. Barrow reached the 1988 FA Trophy semi-final, losing to Enfield after two replays: the first at Aggborough, Kidderminster and the second at Marston Road, Stafford. The first leg, at Holker Street, attracted 6,002 supporters (a club non-League record). Enfield won the first leg 2â1, and Barrow won the second 1â0. Enfield went on to win the trophy against Telford United in a replay at the Hawthorns in West Bromwich after a goalless draw in the final at Wembley. Barrow reached the first round of the FA Cup the following season, losing 3â1 to Rotherham United.

They won the 1990 FA Trophy, their first major trophy as a non-League club, defeating Leek Town in the final at Wembley. Kenny Gordon, not ordinarily a goal-scorer, scored the first and third goals in his final game for his hometown club before emigrating to Australia. Other notable members of the squad included Kenny Lowe, who was sold to Barnet for Â£40,000 (a club record at the time) after the final. The following season (benefiting from direct entry to the first round), Barrow made the third round of the FA Cup for the first time as a non-League club before losing 1â0 away to Third Division high-fliers Bolton Wanderers.

Wilkie was forced to step down during the 1991â92 season due to health problems. Barrow were returned through relegation to the Northern Premier League and Cowperthwaite retired after fifteen seasons with the club, 704 appearances and 282 goals. Wilkie died in December 1992 at age 56, and the road outside the Holker Street ground was later named Wilkie Road in his honour.

===1990s turmoil===
After Wilkie&#x27;s departure and Barrow&#x27;s relegation, the club had three mediocre seasons in the Northern Premier League. In February 1995, Barrow were purchased by boxing promoter and businessman Stephen Vaughan. Vaughan invested in the club, building an all-seater grandstand and signing Conference-standard players. The Bluebirds were promoted to the Conference in 1997â98 under manager Owen Brown.

Vaughan (who had connections with Liverpool drug-dealer Curtis Warren) was investigated for money laundering, although no charges were brought. He left the club at the end of 1998, withdrawing the financial support which had kept it afloat. It was learned that the Holker Street ground (Barrow&#x27;s main asset) had been sold for Â£410,000 to Northern Improvements, a company in which Vaughan had a financial interest. In January 1999, the club were the subject of a compulsory winding-up order and a liquidator was appointed to run it while efforts were made to establish the ground&#x27;s legal owner. A members&#x27; company was formed to provide financial support for the club, with the long-term intention of taking it over.

Although Barrow avoided relegation in the summer of 1999, they were expelled from the Football Conference for improper administration. With support from the Football Association after a long dispute, the club were admitted to the Northern Premier League for the 1999â2000 season almost a month after the season had begun. Barrow survived in the league under manager Kenny Lowe, despite an almost-entirely-new squad. The team improved over the next few years, remaining in administration. They narrowly missed promotion to the Conference twice, finishing second and third in 2003â04 and 2004â05. The legal disputes over the ownership of Holker Street were resolved in August 2002, and the members&#x27; company bought the stadium from the liquidator. In 2003, the Football Association allowed Barrow&#x27;s &quot;football membership&quot; to be transferred to the new company.

The club defeated local rivals Workington in a two-legged April 2004 final in the UniBond Presidents (League) Cup. The game finished 6â6 on aggregate, with Barrow winning on away goals. After their failure to gain promotion to the Conference in 2004â05, Barrow became founding members of another division: the Conference North, which replaced the Northern Premier League one level below the Conference National.

===National League years===
The club had poor form over the following two seasons, narrowly escaping relegation at the end of 2006â07. Manager Lee Turnbull, who succeeded Lowe when Lowe had work commitments, was sacked in 2005 and replaced by Phil Wilson. Defender James Cotterill was jailed for an assault committed on the pitch. In a first round FA Cup game, Cotterill punched Bristol Rovers striker Sean Rigg. The incident was missed by the referee but was caught by the Match of the Day cameras, and Cotterill was the only English player in recent history to be jailed for an offence on the pitch.

After two years as manager, Wilson was dismissed on 12 November 2007. Although the sacking came two days after a good 1â1 draw in the FA Cup first round against AFC Bournemouth, the club&#x27;s continued poor form was the cause. Barrow&#x27;s team affairs were shifted to players Paul Jones, David Bayliss and Darren Sheridan. Following a decent run of results, Bayliss and Sheridan were appointed player-managers, and Jones became club captain. Bayliss and Sheridan led Barrow from 20th place in the league in December to fifth, ensuring a place in the playoffs for promotion to the Conference National. They won the semi-final against AFC Telford United 4â0 on aggregate before defeating Stalybridge Celtic in the playoff final at Pirelli Stadium in Burton upon Trent.

Barrow topped the Conference National table during the first few weeks of the following season before the club began to struggle, finding themselves just above the relegation zone by January 2009. They defeated Brentford 2â1 with goals from David Brown and Matt Henney in round two of the FA Cup, their first victory over Football League opposition since their 1972 elimination from the league. Barrow drew an away match against Middlesbrough (a Premier League team) in the third round, losing 2â1. More than 7,000 Barrow fans travelled to Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough, the highest away attendance in Riverside&#x27;s 14-year history to date. The cup run earned Barrow about Â£250,000, allowing investment in playing resources. The club retained their place in the Conference, finishing twentieth.

Following alterations to the squad during the summer, Barrow began its second season in the Conference National in August 2009. The club had a good run after a poor start, losing once in 16 games and reaching the FA Cup third round. They were defeated 3â0 by Premier League side Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on 2 January 2010, watched by 7,500 travelling supporters. On 13 March 2010, a Gregg Blundell goal gave Barrow a 1â0 win at Salisbury City in the first Leg of the FA Trophy semi-final. One week later, a Jason Walker double secured a 2â1 victory in the second Leg to send the Bluebirds to Wembley. After securing their position in the Conference National in the last home match of the season, Barrow won the 2010 FA Trophy Final against Stevenage Borough 2â1 at Wembley Stadium with an extra-time goal by Walker; this made Barrow the only club to win the FA Trophy at the old and new Wembley Stadiums.

The 2010â11 season was less successful, although the club finished in 18th place and remained in the Conference National with a 2â0 victory against Hayes &amp; Yeading on the last day of the season. Barrow failed to retain the FA Trophy, however, losing 2â3 to Conference North side Guiseley. The side was more successful the following season, finishing 13th. Darren Sheridan left the club by mutual consent in February 2012, and Dave Bayliss remained as manager.

The following season, Barrow were relegated from the Conference National after losing 2â1 at Cambridge United on 13 April 2013. Bayliss left the club by mutual consent on 5 November 2013, and Barrow reappointed former caretaker manager Darren Edmondson on 10 December of that year. That season, the club failed to win promotion to the Conference Premier and finished 11th in the Conference North.

On 1 May 2014, it was announced that club members had voted to allow Dallas businessman Paul Casson to complete a takeover. Barrow were 2014â15 Conference North champions, with a 2â3 win away at Lowestoft Town on the final day of the season. Casson aimed for promotion in the club&#x27;s first season return in the top flight of non-League football. In November 2015, Barrow parted company with manager Darren Edmondson after a poor run left them mid-table and a 1â0 loss to AFC Fylde knocked them out of the 2015â16 FA Cup. The club appointed former Mansfield and Torquay boss Paul Cox manager the following day.

On 20 September 2017, Barrow appointed Micky Moore as first-team manager. Moore was sacked after the club&#x27;s FA Cup defeat in the fourth qualifying round away at Shaw Lane on 15 October of that year. Former Forest Green Rovers boss Ady Pennock was appointed manager on 27 October, accompanied by assistant manager Jamie Day and player-coach Grant Holt. Barrow narrowly avoided relegation, finishing in 20th place, and Pennock and the club parted company on 18 May 2018.

Former Blackpool and Chesterfield defender Ian Evatt became the club&#x27;s manager on 15 June. On 24 October 2018, Casson announced that he was stepping down as chairman and selling the club; director Paul Hornby led a management buyout of the club. The 2018â19 season was much more successful under Evatt, finishing in 10th place this time. The following 2019â20 season was even more successful. The Bluebirds were top of the league for the vast majority of the season before the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The final league table was decided on a points per game basis, meaning Barrow returned to the EFL as champions for the first time since 1972.

===Return to the Football League (2020â)===
During pre-season, manager Ian Evatt departed for newly relegated Bolton Wanderers and was replaced by David Dunn. Barrow&#x27;s first Football League game in 48 years resulted in a 1â1 draw with Stevenage at Holker Street. The Bluebirds finally won at their 9th attempt in the league, with a 4â2 win at Mansfield Town. After 22 matches, the last 9 without a win, and with the team 21st in the table, Dunn was sacked on 13 December 2020. Following Dunn&#x27;s dismissal, assistant manager Rob Kelly was appointed as caretaker manager. Michael Jolley was named as the new manager on 23 December 2020. However, on 21 February 2021, after 7 games in charge, Barrow parted company with Jolley. Following the departure of Jolley, assistant boss Kelly was once again named as Barrow&#x27;s caretaker manager, this time until the end of the season. Kelly saw an upturn of form and on 27 April 2021, with two matches remaining, Barrow secured their Football League status for the following season with a 2â0 win at Forest Green Rovers. At the end of the season, Kelly chose not to remain as manager on a permanent basis and left the club. On 28 May 2021, Mark Cooper was appointed as manager. On 24 August 2021, Barrow hosted Premier League side Aston Villa in an EFL Cup second round tie, losing 6â0. In 2021â22, Barrow finished in 22nd place. In May 2022, Pete Wild was appointed as the new manager. Under Wild, Barrow&#x27;s league performance improved, finishing 9th in the 2022â23 season.

Barrow formed a B Team in the summer of 2023. The team compete in The Central League and its relevant cup competitions. The team is managed by former player, now coach, Jason Taylor. Home games are currently being played at Stalybridge Celtic&#x27;s Bower Fold stadium in Cheshire, close to the first team&#x27;s training base.

At the end of the 2023â24 season, Wild departed the club after Barrow had finished one point outside of the play-off positions. On 31 May 2024, Stephen Clemence was announced as Wild&#x27;s successor on a two-year deal, but, with the club 17th in League Two, was sacked eight months later in January 2025 and replaced by Andy Whing.

==Colours and badge==
A kit with blue shirts and white shorts was in use by 1912, although Barrow&#x27;s original colours were black-and-white stripes. From 1939 to 1959, a blue shirt with a white &quot;V&quot; was the design. Barrow&#x27;s kit has varied from predominantly-blue to predominantly-white, with occasional stripes or hoops. For the 2001â02 season, Barrow played in black-and-white stripes to celebrate the club&#x27;s centennial. Although Barrow&#x27;s away colours have varied, the team wore a yellow kit with blue trim for the 2010 FA Trophy final. Barrow&#x27;s second kit from 2011 to 2013 was sky blue; for the 2013â14 season, however, they opted for a yellow away kit and a blue-and-white-hooped home kit. After a year, the club reverted to a white home kit with blue sleeves for the 2014â15 season. The kits were manufactured by Puma, who had a four-year deal due to expire at the end of the 2015â16 season. The deal was reduced by a year, since the club announced on 30 December 2014 that its kit would be manufactured by PlayerLayer for 2015â16. In 2024, it was announced that the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador would be the club&#x27;s new Front of Shirt sponsor.

The club badge has a bee and arrow (B-arrow) as on the Barrow-in-Furness coat of arms. It features an Astute-class submarine (representing the town&#x27;s shipbuilding industry), a red rose (symbolising Lancashire), and a football.

==Stadium==
Holker Street (known as the SO Legal Stadium for sponsorship purposes) has been Barrow&#x27;s home ground since 1910. It had previously hosted Hindpool Athletic Football Club, and had been a rubbish dump. The first game at the stadium was a 5â2 win for Barrow against Eccles Borough. The ground was gradually developed, so by the resumption of football after World War Two it had four fully-covered, terraced stands. Its record attendance was in 1954, when 16,784 fans watched an FA Cup third-round tie against Swansea Town. Floodlights were installed in 1963, and the ground hosted speedway meetings during the 1970s which necessitated the demolition of the &quot;Steelworks End&quot; (previously damaged by fire), the re-positioning of the pitch and the removal of the front rows of terracing. After the speedway track was removed, the pitch was returned to its original orientation and a new leisure centre with squash courts were built.

Under Stephen Vaughan&#x27;s ownership, an all-seater main stand (named the Brian Arrowsmith Stand in 2017) with a capacity of about 1,000 was built on the Wilkie Road side; the only significant change since then was the removal of an unsafe roof over the Holker Street-end terraces. Described as having &quot;a traditional, old fashioned feel&quot;, the ground has three sides of terracing. The Brian Arrowsmith Stand is raised above the centre of the pitch, with flat standing on either side. The Popular Side, opposite the Brian Arrowsmith Stand, consists of an area of covered terracing.
In the summer of 2020, a roof was added to the Holker Street End of the ground after the club had won through promotion return to the Football League.

In July 2022, SO Legal Ltd secured the sponsorship naming rights for Holker Street, which saw the stadium known as the SO Legal Stadium until the end of the 2023â24 season.
===Training ground===
Although the team plays its home games in Barrow, during the week the team shares the training ground of F.C. United of Manchester, Broadhurst Park, in Moston, Manchester (since summer 2023), having previously trained in Salford, Rochdale and Lancaster; amongst other places.

<doc id="712828" wikidata="Q938034" url="?curid=712828" title="X-Force">
<text>X-Force is a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most commonly in association with the X-Men. Conceived by writer/illustrator Rob Liefeld, the team first appeared in &quot;New Mutants&quot; #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series called &quot;X-Force&quot;. The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team the New Mutants.

X-Force&#x27;s first leader was the mutant Cable. An offshoot of the X-Men, X-Force takes a more militant and aggressive approach towards its enemies compared to the X-Men.

An alternate incarnation of X-Force appears in the 2018 film &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; as part of the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series. A planned X-Force film adaptation was in production at 20th Century Fox, but canceled after Disney acquired the studio.

==Publication history==
===Publication===

The &quot;X-Force&quot; series was successful in the early 1990s, with its popularity holding steady after Liefeld left. As with other X-titles in the 90s, Marvel implemented various reforms to the title throughout its run until 2001, with varying degrees of success. Declining sales on the &quot;X-Force&quot; series eventually prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self-interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X-Force. &quot;X-Force&quot; was canceled with #129 and relaunched as &quot;X-Statix,&quot; which coincided with a similar rebranding of the team in the story. After &quot;X-Statix&quot; was canceled with #26, Marvel reunited the original X-Force team for a six-issue 2004 miniseries plotted and drawn by Liefeld.

In 2007â2008, during the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot; crossover event, a new version of the X-Force team was formed with Wolverine leading a more militaristic black ops branch of the X-Men. This squad would form the basis for a new X-Force series starting February 2008 by writers Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost, plus Clayton Crain as the artist. The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the Second Coming storyline that ran through various X-titles. The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; with Rick Remender and Jerome OpeÃ±a as the creative team and Wolverine, Psylocke, Deadpool, Archangel, Fantomex, and E.V.A. as the initial roster.

The &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; series ended at issue #35 in 2012 and was once again relaunched as &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; (vol. 2) as part of Marvel NOW!, with a new team led by Storm and Psylocke, written by Sam Humphries. A concurrent X-Force book written by Dennis Hopeless, &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot;, was released at the same time, bringing Cable back into the X-Force fold. The two series ended in 2014 after a crossover between the two titled &quot;Vendetta&quot;. A new &quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 4), was launched featuring a black ops squad composed of Cable, Psylocke, Fantomex and Marrow, written by &quot;X-Men: Legacy&quot; writer Simon Spurrier.

===&quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot;===

&quot;X-Force&quot; was replaced in October 2010 with &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; by Rick Remender and Jerome OpeÃ±a. This new series introduces team members Psylocke, Fantomex, and Deadpool. According to Remender, &quot;This is a group of characters that have had their souls stained by evil forces in the past, a common thread connecting them. They&#x27;ve already made the hard compromises in the past; they&#x27;ve all taken life.&quot;

The title had a three-issue &quot;Fear Itself&quot; tie-in miniseries, written by Rob Williams, with art by Simone Bianchi. As of issue #34, thirty-one characters were killed and 14 of them were from the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline.

===&quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; (vol. 2): 2013â2014===

As part of Marvel NOW!, two new X-Force series would replace Remender&#x27;s &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot;. Prior to their announcement, the two titles were teased by a single word and the book&#x27;s creative team: &quot;Wanted&quot; with Dennis Hopeless and Salvador Larroca and &quot;Killers&quot; with Sam Humphries and Ron Garney. &quot;Wanted&quot; was first revealed to be the brand new &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot; with &quot;Killers&quot; later revealed to be a relaunched &quot;Uncanny X-Force.&quot;

&quot;Cable and X-Force&quot;, written by Dennis Hopeless and penciled by Salvador Larroca, featured Cable on the run after awakening from a coma in the post-AvX world. Harkening back to the early days of the original X-Force, Cable would lead an outlaw X-Force team consisting of Domino, Colossus, Forge, Doctor Nemesis and Boom-Boom, whose missions of stopping huge tragedies before they happen puts them at odds with the newly formed Uncanny Avengers, led by Cable&#x27;s uncle, Havok.

The relaunched &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; was written by Sam Humphries and penciled by Ron Garney, and featured a Psylocke-led team with an initial roster of Storm, Puck, and Cluster. They would be joined by Spiral and Bishop as they sought to locate a psychic mutant girl who had been kidnapped.

==Fictional history==
===&quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 3)===
====Angels and Demons====

The team&#x27;s first mission has them investigating the theft of Bastion&#x27;s head from a S.H.I.E.L.D. base. The trail leads back to the Purifiers, led by Matthew Risman and the mysterious Eli Bard. They attach Bastion&#x27;s head to the body of a Nimrod unit, to use the revived Bastion in their &quot;holy war&quot; against mutantkind. Bastion retrieves an offspring of the technarch Magus from the ocean floor and revives several deceased X-Men villains, including Cameron Hodge, Bolivar Trask and Graydon Creed, by infecting their corpses with the Technarch Transmode Virus. The virus allows Bastion a degree of mental control over the revived corpses. He also infects two living subjects with the virus: Donald Pierce and the Leper Queen.

During X-Force&#x27;s raid on a Purifer base, Risman holds Wolfsbane hostage. While Wolverine calls for the team to stand down, X-23 decides Risman is bluffing and activates a concealed detonator that sets off a series of powerful explosives. The explosion brings most of the base down around them, but Risman is able to escape with Wolfsbane during the chaos. Wolverine later admonishes Laura for being so reckless with the lives of her teammates and for allowing Rahne to be kidnapped. After interrogating and killing numerous Purifiers, X-Force finds Rahne held in a warehouse, barely alive. Angel retrieves Elixir to heal Rahne, who wakes up soon after. Laura then catches the scent of Elixir&#x27;s and Angel&#x27;s blood, and runs off to help them. She reaches the room just in time to see Wolfsbane standing above Angel with his severed wings in her jaws. While in the Purifiers&#x27; custody, Rahne had been brainwashed by her deranged father, Reverend Craig, causing her to go berserk at the sight of an angelic figure. Wolfsbane savagely attacks Laura before handing over Angel&#x27;s wings to the Purifiers.

Elixir heals both his and Angel&#x27;s wounds, then discovers that Angel&#x27;s wings aren&#x27;t organic and can&#x27;t be regrown. Angel transforms into Archangel, complete with metallic wings. Archangel wounds Wolverine and X-23 before taking off toward the Purifiers&#x27; base, sensing his old wings. Meanwhile, the Purifiers use samples of Angel&#x27;s stolen wings to develop techno-organic wings for their soldiers, giving them similar abilities to Archangel. The group of Purifiers given wings is dubbed &quot;The Choir&quot;. X-Force pursues Archangel to the Purifiers&#x27; base and slaughters most of The Choir, while Risman discovers Eli Bard absorbing the Technarch offspring into his hand. X-23 kills Risman with a headshot, and briefly fights Eli. Eli overpowers her, but is prevented from killing her when Warpath stabs him, causing him to flee. Wolverine takes on Bastion, who deems the threat posed by Wolverine &quot;unacceptable&quot; and retreats. Afterwards, X-Force finds Archangel unconscious and in human form, complete with feathered wings. Wolverine informs Cyclops of the turn of events, and Cyclops asks which of X-Force&#x27;s targets should be next.

====Old Ghosts====
Once X-Force regroups at Angel&#x27;s Aerie, they test the reactions of Rahne and Angel to one another. Rahne reverts to full feral form upon seeing Angel, who responds by transforming into Archangel. Wolverine and Elixir restrain Wolfsbane while Cyclops talks down Archangel, who has trouble controlling his Apocalypse-like mentality while in his transformed state. Laura calls in the Stepford Cuckoos to erase Elixir&#x27;s memories of X-Force, to help them remain covert. Before they do so, Angel informs them of a live telecast featuring Graydon Creed, who claims an L.M.D. was assassinated in his place and publicly denounces mutants once more. Cyclops assembles X-Force, including Elixir, and unexpectedly declares the Vanisher as their next target.

It is revealed that Scalphunter, a former Marauder, contacted Cyclops about a break-in at an old lab of Mister Sinister&#x27;s that held an altered version of the Legacy Virus. While in pursuit of the Vanisher, the team runs into Domino, who joins forces with them to recover the Legacy Virus. After cornering Vanisher and inducing an inoperable brain tumor (courtesy of Elixir) to ensure his cooperation, Vanisher reveals he lost the virus while escaping from a horde of Marauder clones that were awakened after the death of Sinister. X-Force returns to the lab and kill the cloned Marauders inside. Domino retrieves the virus, only to be confronted by The Right&#x27;s shocktroopers, who have come to take the virus for themselves. X-23 is injected with the virus while doing battle, and runs toward a nearby molten vat to destroy herself (thus destroying the virus). Elixir catches Laura as she jumps, and uses his healing powers to purge her of the virus, declaring that his purpose in X-Force is to ensure no more of his friends will die. With Vanisher in tow, X-Force returns home.

Meanwhile, Warpath returns to his tribe&#x27;s reservation at Camp Verde to visit his brother&#x27;s grave, but discovers the empty graves of his entire tribe before being violently attacked by the Demon Bear. Just as he&#x27;s about to be killed, Warpath is saved by Ghost Rider, who offers to teach him how to kill a demon. After engaging the Demon Bear in battle once more, Ghost Rider realizes the demon is reacting to pain caused by a dagger embedded in its body. Once Warpath removes the dagger, the demon is revealed to be the spirit guides of Warpath&#x27;s tribe, corrupted by the black magic of the dagger. These spirits grant Warpath a vision that reveals the history of the man responsible for digging up the graves of his tribe: Eli Bard. Warpath returns home and tells X-Force what the spirits showed him, which ends with the revelation that Eli is using the Technarch Transmode Virus to revive dead mutants as an offering to his queen, Selene.

Soon after, Beautiful Dreamer mysteriously dies after losing control of her powers and killing hundreds of civilians. Cyclops realizes this was likely caused by the mutated Legacy Virus, and assembles X-Force to deal with the situation. Cyclops also reveals he&#x27;s in the process of tracking down Cable, and gives each of them a time-travel device that will be remotely activated when Beast determines Cable&#x27;s exact location in the timestream. Fever Pitch loses control of his powers soon after, resulting in a similar massacre. While escaping the explosion, Archangel spots the Leper Queen and informs Cyclops. Once Boom-Boom, Hellion and Surge are kidnapped, the Stepford Cuckoos use Cerebra to track them down. Hellion and Surge are injected with the altered Legacy Virus and teleported out just as X-Force storm the Leper Queen&#x27;s base. As Wolverine questions the Leper Queen, Cyclops informs him that Cable has been found and X-Force is being sent after him. Despite Wolverine&#x27;s protests, Cyclops activates the time-travel devices, sending X-Force forward in time before they can kill the Leper Queen.

====Messiah War====

X-Force is involuntarily sent to the future to retrieve Cable and Hope. The landscape is a barren, ravaged area, and the team quickly encounters danger. Apocalypse has been defeated, and Stryfe controls this future. X-Force and Cable struggle to save Hope from Bishop and Stryfe.

====Not Forgotten====
&quot;Not Forgotten&quot; takes place directly after X-Force&#x27;s return to the present. X-23 emerges from the timestream just in time to save Boom-Boom from being killed by the Leper Queen. Seconds after she kills the Leper Queen, both she and Boom-Boom are taken into custody by agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. At the United Nations, Hellion and Surge are rescued from the Sapien League by Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir. Boom-Boom is freed from H.A.M.M.E.R. custody by Warpath, while X-23 is returned to The Facility. She wakes up to find her left arm severed by Kimura, wielding a chain saw. Before she can cut off the right arm, Kimura is shot by Agent Morales. Agent Young is revealed to be a member of The Facility that infiltrated H.A.M.M.E.R. to acquire the intel that Morales had on X-23. When Young tries to recruit Morales into The Facility, she rejects his offer by beating him unconscious. In the present, X-23 and Morales make their way to a Facility lab that holds mass amounts of the chemical trigger that forces X-23 to kill. While still in the room, X-23 cuts open her severed arm to remove the claws and she gives the claws to Morales to keep them safe. She improvises a Molotov cocktail and uses it to activate the sprinkler system. The soldiers of the Facility cut through to X-23 but Kimura notices that the sprinklers are instead spraying her Trigger Scent everywhere. Laura becomes feral and kills the soldiers and goes to the office of the Facility head, where the sprinklers begin spraying water, which washes away the Trigger Scent. Kimura is able to club Laura from behind to knock her out and then murders the Facility head, to frame Laura for his death. Agent Morales then arrives and lights Kimura on fire so she will be distracted while Morales and Laura escape. Morales reveals that she rigged the building to explode but they are able to get out before the explosing. The other members of X-Force arrive and they take Laura home with her severed claws, and this leads them into the events called Necrosha.

====Necrosha====

X-Force is involved in the battle against Selene&#x27;s resurrected mutant forces on Utopia, until Cyclops sends them to Genosha to kill Selene.

They arrive at Necrosha and manage to rescue Warpath, who then leads them in battle against a god-like Selene, and manage to kill her using an old ritual of Warpath&#x27;s tribe. Wolverine tells Cyclops that Warpath, X-23, Wolfsbane and Elixir are out of the team, but Cyclops insists that X-Force will be needed more than ever in the time ahead.

====X-Men: Second Coming====

X-Force is joined by Cable and Cypher on a time-traveling mission to stop an invasion of Nimrods sent from a possible dystopian future. As Cable only has one use remaining on his time-traveling device, it is believed to be a one-way suicide mission. After they complete their mission and Cable sacrifices himself to return X-Force to the present, Hope&#x27;s mutant powers emerge and she destroys Bastion. After the battle, Logan is confronted by Storm about X-Force. She tells Logan that he never should have involved James, Rahne and Laura, and Logan tells her that he never wanted them involved, but doesn&#x27;t regret what they did. Logan tells Laura that she&#x27;s out and to figure out what she wants from life. Afterward, Logan discusses the future of X-Force with Cyclops, who decides to disband the team. Logan meets with his new team a short time later, consisting of himself, Archangel, Fantomex, Psylocke and Deadpool, deciding to run a new X-Force team without the knowledge of Cyclops or the other X-Men.

===&quot;X-Force&quot; (vol. 4)===
====Dirty/Tricks====
The new X-force consists of Cable, Marrow (who despite losing her powers during M-Day is repowered using a psychic headband), Psylocke, Fantomex, and Dr. Nemesis. They are investigating an explosion in Alexandria that put Hope Summers into a coma and find a new mutant nicknamed Meme, since she can only communicate through computers, as her body is comatose. They discover Russian billionaire Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga is behind Alexandria explosion and the kidnapping. He has been kidnapping mutants and supercharging them with kinetic energy and making them into human bombs. While in Paris, they pretend to kill a mutant that can read the minds of cats, so the French secret mutant forces, Le Bureaus Discret, will come to investigate, then they kidnap Le Necrogateur, a mutant that can read the minds of the deceased. Using his powers they find Volga&#x27;s headquarters and that Volga found a mutant that can teleport between dimensions. Threatening the death of his family, they force the teleporting mutant to bring back a powerful weapon from Earth 1287, that creates super soldiers but greatly decreases their lifespan. During the attack on Volga&#x27;s base Marrow discovers that she was pregnant during M-Day and volunteered to get her powers back, but at the cost of her pregnancy. She has a mental breakdown and X-Force is captured. It seems all is lost when Cable is super-charged and blown up by Volga. It turns out that Cable was present at Alexandria and it was him and Hope that caused the explosion when he was supercharged by Volga&#x27;s henchman. Hope mimicked his powers and the chemicals caused her to fall into a coma. Cable survived the explosions since he wasn&#x27;t really thereâDr. Nemesis keeps Cable locked in stasis and creates a clone of him every day and uploads his memories. The Cable and Dr. Nemesis attack Volga&#x27;s base again and teleports his supercharged henchmen into outer space and then Volga seems to commit suicide by super-charging himself and killing the Cable clone again, but Marrow creates a bone shield to protect the team. Volga&#x27;s spirit survives the explosion and another Cable clone emerges from the X-Force base to mourn over Hope, who was able to manifest herself in a digital avatar by copying the powers of a brain-dead mutant, Meme. Psylocke is able to discover the switch with her psychic powers, but promises Hope that she won&#x27;t tell Cable.

====Hide/Fear====
Cable and the X-Force who have barely survived their ordeal with Volga, track a team of British special forces into the desert. The team is tracking terrorists known as the Quaddees. It turns out Volga sold his tech to both the British and the Quaddees. X-Force begins abducting the team, but are attacked by Pete Wisdom, Meggan, and Excalibur from MI-13. Soon the Quaddees kidnap one member of the team, so the three groups decide to work together. Psylocke is able to find out that the super-powered British Special forces team will all die soon from Volga&#x27;s tech, so the team sacrifices themselves so MI-13 and X-Force can escape. They also learn that there&#x27;s a secret organization called the Yellow Eye spying on all mutants, who also kidnapped Domino. This series also retcons multiple X-Men backstories with the introduction of ForgetMeNot. His power is to immediately be forgotten by anybody who speaks with him and to be completely unnoticed by people around him unless he acknowledges them. Only Xavier knows of his existenceâeven setting a psychic alarm clock to check in with ForgetMeNot every hour to remind him somebody remembers him. He hangs around the X-Mansion repelling attackers and saving the X-Men multiple times, without them realizing it and blaming it on dumb luck or a deus ex machina. Dr. Nemesis, using an algorithm based on blurs in camera footage and missing toilet paper at the X-Mansion creates a teleporter to bring ForgetMeNot to the X-Force base on an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The team has great difficulty catching ForgetMeNot, since whenever he hides they forgot about him then take a coffee break, where a prerecorded video by Dr. Nemesis plays reminding them to find ForgetMeNot. This turns into a vicious cycle, almost like a time loop, until ForgetMeNot realizes that he was brought here to trick the Yellow Eye spybots (which look like tiny gnats) into allowing himself to be tracked, place a reverse tracking beacon on one and then the drone will forget him immediately and not self-destruct. This plan works; however, Fantomex then kills ForgetMeNot. Stating that he knew about him all the time since he has three brains and nanobots in his brain. Fantomex says he does it because he is evil and bored. The ships cleaning bots sweep away ForgetMeNot&#x27;s body and Dr. Nemesis forgets speaking with him and assumes he figured out how to track the spybots on his own.

====Ends/Means====
The team attacks the Yellow Eye base, but during the battle Meme/Hope Summers hacks into Fantomex&#x27;s consciousness, thanks to his nanobot brain, in order to learn why he broke up with her. He then reveals that he knew Hope Summers was posing as Meme. He then betrays the team and plans to use the Yellow Eye tracking technology to find his missing clones (Cluster and Weapon XIII). Luckily, it turns out Domino was brainwashed by the Yellow Eye, but Meme was able to hack into her and free her. She then shoots Fantomex in the head. It turns out Yellow Eye is actually Mojo, who reveals that Meme is actually Hope Summers to the rest of the team. Cable debates using the Yellow Eye Technology, but Psylocke wants the facility destroyed. They don&#x27;t have time to debate since the second clone of Cable was already at the facility with Dr. Nemesis tracking Volga during the prior fight. The team doesn&#x27;t have time to debate the morality since Fantomex was able to recode Volga&#x27;s super virus code when he died and E.V.A. reloaded the virus to give her unlimited superpowers. However, since his mind is still mechanical Meme hacked into him making him think he killed the team, while they actually escaped. Back at the base Cable tricks Fantomex into fighting him, but is actually getting Fantomex to destroy various spy agencies and evil organizations. ForgetMeNot also reveals himself to Hope Summers and explains that the original Meme is still alive and saved him by transferring his consciousness and then repaired his body with the ships clean up bots. He reveals that Meme is actually dying, and once she dies Hope will not be able to copy Meme&#x27;s powers and communicate with the team using her hacking powers. After Meme dies, ForgetMeNot reveals himself to the team and asks Marrow to touch Hope&#x27;s body, then Hopes copies Marrow&#x27;s healing factor and is able to temporarily heal herself enough to play a video showing how Cable has been manipulating the team. ForgetMeNot then pushes Psylocke into Hope, who then copies her psychic powers and reveals to the team her troubles childhood and how despite Cable saving her life by traveling between dimensions, she has outgrown him morally and doesn&#x27;t look up to him. Marrow then kills the Cable clone. Hope also revealed their location to Fantomex, who is on his way to kill them. The team doesn&#x27;t think they have a chance at stopping him, but Hope has a plan that will only work if they act as a team. Domino and Psylocke distract Fantomex while ForgetMeNot sneaks up to him and teleports him to Hope, who copies his super-powers, as well as the entire teams. She releases all the Cable clones against Fantomex. Hope, using Dr. Nemesis&#x27;s super intellect, then figures out that Fantomex doesn&#x27;t believe he is imperfect, but reveals to him that perfect requires cracks and inadequacies and perfection is really being a team. Fantomex cannot comprehend this and has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psi-blade to scramble his mind. The team later reveals they &quot;fired&quot; Cable from the team.

==Awards==
Issues #57â58 of the first series were part of the Onslaught storyline which was a top vote-getter for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for 1997.

==The original X-Force==
Before the team best known as X-Force debuted, Marvel introduced an unrelated, little-known group also called X-Force. It was a short-lived group that was designed to replace Freedom Force. The members were not mutants, but received their powers artificially and were named after the X-Men. This group was organized by a government agency known as M Branch and only appeared in the pages of &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; #9â10 (1990).

==Other versions==
* In the alternate reality of the &quot;Days of Future Now&quot; storyline, the X-Force consists of Banshee, Black Tom Cassidy, Cannonball, Domino, Meltdown and Omega Red.
* In &quot;X-Men &#x27;92&quot;, the X-Force consists of Cable, Domino, Deadpool, Psylocke, Archangel, and Bishop.

==In other media==
===Film===

* 20th Century Fox were in the midst of developing a film adaptation of &quot;X-Force&quot;. On July 11, 2013, it was reported that Jeff Wadlow had been hired to write and direct the adaptation. Lauren Shuler Donner and Matthew Vaughn would have produced. On December 3, 2013, Rob Liefeld confirmed that Cable and Deadpool would be appearing in the film. The film was planned to be released sometime in the year 2017. In 2015, a piece of concept art depicting Cable, Domino, Warpath, Cannonball, and Feral as members of the team was released. After the release of the live-action film &quot;Deadpool&quot;, its leading actor Ryan Reynolds felt that the title character would soon be in an &quot;X-Force&quot; film, and producer Simon Kinberg stated that there was potential for &quot;X-Force&quot; to be rated-R like &quot;Deadpool&quot; in contrast to the PG-13 &quot;mainline X-Men movies&quot;. &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;X2&quot; director Bryan Singer stated in an interview with Fandango that he would like to see X-23 appear in the film as the new Wolverine. In addition, Psylocke was rumored to appear in the film as she is a very prominent member of the team in the comic books; however, actress Olivia Munn (who portrays Psylocke in the film &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;) has not addressed these rumors. On November 9, 2016, Kinberg announced to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that the film was still on their schedule. In February 2017, it was reported that Reynolds would co-write the script with Joe Carnahan. On September 7, 2017, Drew Goddard was brought on to write and direct &quot;X-Force&quot;. On February 21, 2018, &quot;Hollywood North Buzz&quot; reported that the film would start shooting that October before the Disney/Fox deal was finalized.
* X-Force appears in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, led by Deadpool and consisting of Domino, Bedlam, Shatterstar, Zeitgeist, Vanisher, and Peter. Deadpool and Weasel form the group to confront Cable. However, all except Deadpool and Domino are killed after their first mission begins. In a post-credits scene, Deadpool uses Cable&#x27;s time-travel device to travel back in time and successfully avert Peter&#x27;s death since he had come to like him.
* Following the release of &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, co-writer Rhett Reese confirmed the &quot;X-Force&quot; movie would be an R-rated take on the X-Men and would have &quot;all the sex, violence, and silliness one would expect from the Deadpool-skewed militarized mutant force&quot;. Reese also said &quot;they can get their hands dirty a little bit. There&#x27;s more gray area. It&#x27;ll be raunchier, it&#x27;ll be rated R, I&#x27;m sure. We&#x27;ll get to see an ensemble movie that&#x27;s pushed, hopefully, as far as the Deadpool individual movie was pushed.&quot;
* On February 5, 2019, X-Men film producer Lauren Shuler Donner revealed that &quot;X-Force&quot;, as well as the rest of the Fox Marvel films, were &quot;on hold&quot; until the Disney-Fox deal went through.

===Video games===
* X-Force appears in Deadpool&#x27;s ending in &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, consisting of Domino, Fantomex, and Archangel.
* X-Force appears in &quot;Marvel Contest of Champions&quot;, consisting of Archangel, X-23, Domino, Cable, Deadpool, and Psylocke.

<text>Matford was a French automotive manufacturer established as a joint venture in 1934 by local firm Mathis and US-based Ford Motor Company. The name &quot;Matford&quot; derived from both companies&#x27; names. The company ceased activities in 1940.

== Overview ==
In the early 1930s, the Ford Motor Company was quickly expanding its European production, while Mathis S.A. had financial problems, but also a large, underutilized factory at Strasbourg (which, following frontier changes formalized in 1919, was now in France).

Ford were keen to increase production and the Mathis plant in Strasbourg seemed more suitable than their existing workshop in AsniÃ¨res-sur-Seine. A joint venture between Ford and Mathis was created under the name of &quot;Matford S.A.&quot;, formally created on 1 October 1934, and owned by Ford and Matthis in the proportion 60:40. The initial cars were locally assembled versions of contemporary American and British Ford models.

The intention had been expressed to produce the Matford models alongside those from Mathis but the last Mathis was actually made in October 1934, which was also the month in which Matford was formally founded. During 1935, under the energetic direction of Maurice Dollfus who had joined Ford in 1930, Ford poured massive amounts of capital into modernising the Strasbourg plant. There were high hopes for the Matford collaboration which, in 1934, was expected to last for fifty years.

In 1935 a range of V8-engined Matfords was put on the market which were very similar to the American Ford Model 48s with their V-8 engines. A French version appeared in 1936 as the model that has come to be known as the Matford Alsace, with a choice of a 2,225 or 3,622Â cc V8 engine: a cabriolet was also listed. The 1937 models were generally known at the time simply as the Matford 13CV and the Matford 21CV which followed the convention of the time by using the cars&#x27; fiscal horse power ratings as model names. Both featured a V-shaped windscreen and in 1938 a US style timber bodied estate car joined the range. The steel car bodies were purchased from the coachbuilders Chausson rather than being built inhouse.

Volume passenger car production ended in 1940 with the buildup of truck orders for the French army, though an unknown number were made during the German occupation, at least till 1942. Under the occupation, because of its proximity to the German border, the contents of the Matford Stasbourg factory were moved to Ford&#x27;s Cologne plant, while a new Ford plant was opened at Poissy, near Paris, in 1940.

Ford&#x27;s links with Mathis were severed. Ford&#x27;s French business was restructured in 1940, now taking the name Ford SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme FranÃ§aise and this company used the Ford trademark. Ãmile Mathis, fearing persecution under German occupation, escaped to the United States where he spent the war, while Matford ceased to exist.

Matford cars achieved success at the Coupe de Dames (1936) and at Monte Carlo (1938).

<doc id="712832" wikidata="Q239105" url="?curid=712832" title="GraÃ§a Machel">
<text>GraÃ§a Machel (; ; born 17 October 1945) is a Mozambican politician and humanitarian. Machel is an international advocate for women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s rights and was made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for her humanitarian work. She is the only woman in modern history to have served as First Lady of two countries: South Africa and Mozambique. She is the widow of former President of Mozambique Samora Machel (1975â1986) and former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela (1998â2013).

GraÃ§a Machel is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. As a panel member, she facilitates coalition building to leverage and broker knowledge, and convenes decision-makers to influence policy for lasting change in Africa.

She was chancellor of the University of Cape Town between 1999 and 2019.

==Early life and education==

GraÃ§a Simbine was born 17 days after her father&#x27;s death, the youngest of six children, in rural Incadine, Gaza Province, Portuguese East Africa (modern-day Mozambique). She attended Methodist mission schools before gaining a scholarship to the University of Lisbon in Portugal, where she studied German and first became involved in independence issues.

Machel also speaks French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and English, as well as her native Xitsonga language.

== Political career ==
Simbine returned to Portuguese East Africa in 1973, joining the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) and working as a schoolteacher. Following Mozambique&#x27;s independence in 1975, Simbine was appointed Mozambican&#x27;s first Minister of Education and Culture on 25 June 1975.

During her tenure, the number of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools rose from about 40 per cent of all school-aged children to over 90 per cent for males and 75 per cent for females.

== Later career ==
GraÃ§a Machel received the 1992 Africa Prize, awarded annually to an individual who has contributed to the goal of eliminating hunger in Africa by the year 2000. Machel received the 1995 Nansen Medal from the United Nations in recognition of her longstanding humanitarian work, particularly on behalf of refugee children.

In 1997, Machel was honored with the Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions and services in the field of human rights protection. In the same year, she received the Global Citizen Award of the New England Circle. Machel was one of the two winners of the 1998 NorthâSouth Prize awarded by the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe.

Machel was chancellor of the University of Cape Town from 1999 to 2019. In 2009, Machel was appointed to the Commonwealth of Nations&#x27; Eminent Persons Group. She was named president of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London in 2012. In 2016, Machel was named chancellor of the African Leadership University, a role that she still holds today.

In July 2017, Machel was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy for the humanities and social sciences.
In 2018, she was awarded by the World Health Organization for her contributions to the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents.

On 17 July 2018, Machel attended the 16th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, which was located at the Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, alongside South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and former US President Barack Obama. The event was visited by nearly 15,000 people, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s birth.

In the leadup to COP27, Machel advocates that Africa&#x27;s youth should have a greater say in climate politics and warned that existing development aid programs covering, for example, education may well be cut and diverted to fund climate change adaptation instead.

=== United Nations ===
Following her retirement from the Mozambique ministry, Machel was appointed as the expert in charge of producing the groundbreaking United Nations report on the impact of armed conflict on children. From 2008 until 2009, she was a member of the High-Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems, co-chaired by Gordon Brown and Robert Zoellick. She served as the Chair of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health (PMNCH) from 2013-2018. In January 2016, she was also appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the High-level Advisory Group for &quot;Every Woman Every Child.&quot;

On 17 January 2016, she was appointed as a Sustainable Development Goals Advocate alongside 16 others, all appointed by Secretary-General of the United Nations

=== The Elders ===
On 18 July 2007 in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nelson Mandela, GraÃ§a Machel, and Desmond Tutu convened The Elders. Mandela announced its formation in a speech on his 89th birthday. The group works on thematic as well as geographically specific subjects. The Elders&#x27; priority issue areas include the IsraeliâPalestinian conflict, the Korean Peninsula, Sudan and South Sudan, sustainable development, and equality for girls and women.

Machel has been particularly involved in The Elders&#x27; work on child marriage, including the founding of Girls Not Brides: The Global Partnership to End Child Marriage.

<text>ÇXegwi (pronounced ), also known as &quot;Batwa,&quot; is an extinct ÇKwi language spoken at Lake Chrissie in South Africa, near the Swazi border. The last known speaker, Jopi Mabinda, was murdered in 1988. However, a reporter for the South African newspaper &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; reports that ÇXegwi may still be spoken in the Chrissiesmeer district.

The ÇXegwi name for their language has been spelled &quot;giÇkwiêgwi&quot; or &quot;kiÇkwiêgwi.&quot; Their name for themselves has been transcribed &quot;tlou tle&quot; or &quot;kxlou-kxle&quot;, presumably . The Nguni (Zulu and Swazi) called them &quot;(a)batwa, amaNkqeshe, amaNgqwigqwi&quot;; the Sotho called them &quot;Baroa/Barwa&quot;.

==Phonology==
ÇXegwi lost the abrupt clicks (the various manners of Ç and Ç) found in its relatives. It reacquired from Nguni Bantu languages, but clicks remained relatively infrequent, compared to other Tuu languages. It also had a series of uvular plosives not found in other Tuu languages.

<doc id="712838" wikidata="Q7107274" url="?curid=712838" title="Osnaburg">
<text>Osnaburg is a general term for coarse, plain-weave fabric. It also refers specifically to a historic fabric originally woven in flax but also in tow or jute, and from flax or tow warp with a mixed or jute weft.

== Historic osnaburg ==
Osnaburg fabric may have been first imported into English-speaking countries from the German city of OsnabrÃ¼ck, from which it gets its name. Scottish weavers produced a coarse lint- or tow-based linen imitation in the later 1730s, which quickly became the most important variety in east-central Scotland. Sales quadrupled, from 0.5 million yards in 1747 to 2.2 million yards in 1758. It was exported mainly to England, the Netherlands, and Britain&#x27;s colonies in America. In the Atlantic plantation complex, prior to the abolition of slavery, osnaburg was the fabric most often used for slave garments.

It was in widespread use worldwide for general utility and housework, with finer varieties used as common sheeting. Grades contained from 20 to 36 threads per inch and 10 to 15 picks per inch.

=== In culture ===
* &quot;Osnaburg covers&quot; are referenced by Cormac McCarthy as wagon coverings in his novel, &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; (1985), which details the murderous Texas Glanton gang of the 1850&#x27;s. 
* &quot;Osnaburg sheets&quot; are referenced by Josiah A. Gregg as cargo coverings in his 1844 book, &quot;Commerce of the Prairies,&quot; which details his eyewitness experiences as a trader on the Santa Fe Trail. 
* In &quot;The Prairie Traveler&quot; (1859) Captain Randolph B. Marcy recommends that every wagon used to cross the plains by settlers &quot;be furnished ... with double osnaburg covers, to protect its contents from the sun and weather.&quot; This use is also mentioned in Gwen Bristow&#x27;s novel &quot;Jubilee Trail&quot;: in Chapter 10, it is spelled &quot;osnabrig&quot;.
* In the novel &quot;S.&quot; by J.Â J. Abrams and Doug Dorst, there is a description of a sailor &quot;clad neck-to-shin in sailor&#x27;s osnaburg&quot;.
* In the novel &quot;Book of Negroes&quot; by Lawrence Hill, there is a description of slaves being given garments of osnaburg cloth to wear.
* In the novel &quot;The Water Dancer&quot; by Ta-Nehisi Coates, the main character, a slave named Hi, wears osnaburg clothing.

== Modern osnaburg ==
Fabric sold today as &quot;osnaburg&quot; is typically an unprocessed, relatively stiff cotton twill. Though rough by modern standards, it is much finer and softer than historic osnaburg.

The Spanish word &quot;osnaburgo&quot; is still commonly used in Chile for coarsely woven cotton or linen fabric.

<doc id="712844" wikidata="Q1606477" url="?curid=712844" title="Henry B. Payne">
<text>Henry B. Payne (November 30, 1810September 9, 1896) was an American politician from Ohio. Moving to Ohio from his native New York in 1833, he quickly established himself in law and business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874. In the House, he worked unsuccessfully for a compromise in the debate over whether all of the nation&#x27;s currency should be backed by gold. He was defeated for reelection, but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election.

He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock, who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884. His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery, but after investigation by the Senate, Payne was permitted to keep his seat. In the Senate, he voted for moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote. He did not run for reelection, and died in 1896.

==Early life ==
Henry Payne was born in Hamilton, Madison County, New York, in 1810, to Elisha and Esther (nÃ©e Douglass) Payne. Both of his parents were Connecticut natives who had moved to New York in the 1790s.

Payne attended the common schools and graduated from Hamilton College in 1832. After graduation, Payne read law in the Canandaigua office of John C. Spencer, a Whig politician and future Secretary of War. While working there, Payne became good friends with future United States Senator and 1860 Democratic presidential candidate Stephen A. Douglas, who was studying law with another local attorney.

==Career==
In 1833, Payne moved to Cleveland, Ohio, then a town of just 3000 people. Douglas preceded him there, but was ill, and Payne&#x27;s first task on arrival in Ohio was to nurse his friend back to health. Under Sherlock J. Andrews, Payne continued to study law, and was admitted to the bar in 1834. He opened his own practice the same year, forming a partnership with future United States federal judge Hiram V. Willson. The firm became successful quickly; within ten years Payne and Willson was among the top firms in Ohio.

Payne&#x27;s law practice continued to be successful through the early 1840s, but after suffering from attacks of hemoptysis (bleeding in the lungs), he was forced to curtail his activities. Instead, he devoted his time to business affairs and local politics. He began to promote the extension of railroads into Cleveland. Along with a few associates, Payne founded the Cleveland and Columbus Railroad in 1851, and served as its president. He also invested in several other local railroads. He resigned the railroad presidency in 1854, but the following year became president of a different railroad, the Painesville and Ashtabula. That same year, Payne became one of Cleveland&#x27;s first water works commissioners. He also invested in real estate, and in 1888 arranged for the construction of the Perry-Payne Building in the present-day Warehouse District.

===Ohio politics===
Payne entered local politics as a Democrat, serving as a Presidential elector in 1848 for Democratic nominees Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler. He was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 1849, and served there until 1854. At the same time, he was a member of the Ohio Senate from 1849 to 1851. His skill as a parliamentarian led his party to nominate him for the United States Senate in 1851, but the election went to Whig candidate, Benjamin Wade, by a vote of 44â34. Payne attended the 1856 Democratic National Convention, where he worked successfully for the nomination of James Buchanan. He ran for Governor of Ohio in 1857, but narrowly lost to the incumbent Republican, Salmon P. Chase. With more than 300,000 votes cast, Payne fell short of victory by just 1,503. In 1860, he again attended the Democrats&#x27; convention, where he helped nominate his old friend Stephen A. Douglas, and sided with Douglas&#x27;s faction as the party divided into northern and southern halves.

At the 1860 convention, Payne denounced the right of secession, and during the Civil War that began the next year, he was a staunch supporter of the Union. Although he was not an abolitionist, he opposed the further extension of slavery. During the war, Payne used some of his wealth to help equip Ohio regiments. He was 50 years old when the war began, too old to volunteer himself, but two of his sons served in the Union Army with his blessing. After the war, Payne continued his political activity, leading the Ohio delegation to the 1872 Democratic National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Horace Greeley. He campaigned on Greeley&#x27;s behalf, raising his own political profile in the process. In 1874, Payne ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio&#x27;s 20th district, and was elected with a 2500-vote majority over the incumbent Republican, Richard C. Parsons.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
When the 44th United States Congress assembled, the House was controlled by the Democrats for the first time since the Civil War. Payne was placed on the Banking and Currency Committee and the Committee for the Reform of Civil Service. At the time, the currency circulating in the United States was a mix of gold-backed dollars and &quot;greenbacks&quot; that were backed only by the credit of the United States, with the public considering greenbacks to be worth less than gold dollars. The previous Congress, controlled by Republicans, had passed the Specie Payment Resumption Act, which would return the United States to the gold standard by 1879. Opinion among Democrats was split, with Eastern Democrats supporting the Act, and Western and Southern members hoping for its repeal.

Payne drew up a compromise bill, in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual, partial return to gold-backed money. Under the Payne Act, national banks would be required to build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year, adding an additional three percent each year until 1885, when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks. At that point, greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold. This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard, and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill. Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House, but it was voted down, 81 to 157. The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act, 133 to 120, but the Senate declined to take up the matter. Specie resumption remained the law of the land when the 44th Congress&#x27;s term expired.

In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York in one of the most hotly contested presidential elections to that time in the nation&#x27;s history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Payne was named to the committee at Tilden&#x27;s request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After the Commissions result, Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall in accepting the commission&#x27;s result. The effort failed, and Hayes became president on March 4, 1877.

===Presidential politics===
Payne ran for reelection in 1876 but was defeated by Republican Amos Townsend. He remained involved in politics, however, and even considered running for the Democratic nomination for president in 1880. Tilden, while not officially a candidate, wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer. Tilden did tell some of his close supporters that, if he did not run, Payne would be his first choice and House Speaker Samuel J. Randall his second. With that, many of the Tilden loyalists pledged their support to Payne, at least until Tilden decided to enter the race. Although Tilden ultimately declined to be nominated, Payne&#x27;s chances were hindered when Ohio&#x27;s delegation remained loyal to Senator Allen G. Thurman. Although Payne place third on the convention&#x27;s first ballot, on the second the delegates stampeded to General Winfield Scott Hancock, who was nominated.

===Election to the U.S. Senate===
In 1884, the Democrats held a majority in the Ohio legislature. In a caucus meeting to determine the party&#x27;s choice for United States Senator, many Democratic legislators looked to replace the incumbent Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, because they disagreed with his advocacy of civil service reform and low tariffs. Some of Pendleton&#x27;s opponents, led by Oliver Payne, promoted Henry Payne for the Senate seat, recalling his opposition to both of those positions during his time in the House. After a secret ballot by the Democratic caucus, Payne received 46 out of 80 votes. Because Oliver was a trustee and treasurer of the Standard Oil company, many of the Pendleton supporters immediately alleged that $100,000 from the oil trust had been used to bribe Democratic legislators, and claimed that an open ballot would not have favored Payne.

When the full legislature met, Payne was elected with 78 votes out of 120. The Democratic legislature initially refused to investigate their members&#x27; alleged corruption, but when Republicans regained the majority in the next session, the legislature looked into the allegations and forwarded the results to the federal Senate. The evidence gathered was voluminous, but the Senate declined to expel Payne, who proclaimed his innocence. While there was never enough evidence for definitive proof of bribery, biographer Dewayne Burke wrote that the &quot;circumstantial evidence seems to convict Payne&quot; of the charge.

===Tariffs and interstate commerce===
In the Senate, the most prominent fight was over the need for a strong protective tariff, which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing. Payne supported a high tariff, but thought some small reductions would be prudent in order to reduce the federal government&#x27;s surplus. He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison, which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent. His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron. This Allison bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate, but failed to pass in the House, which was controlled by Democrats.

At the same time, the regulation of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation&#x27;s business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for a bill that would reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.

==Personal life==
In 1836, Payne married Mary Perry (1818â1895), the only child of Nathan Perry Jr., a wealthy local merchant who was the son of Nathan Perry, known as &quot;Major,&quot; and Sophia Leonora (nÃ©e Root) Perry, and his wife, Paulina (nÃ©e Skinner) Perry, a daughter of Abraham Skinner and Mary (nÃ©e Ayers) Skinner. Together, they were the parents of six children:

* Nathan P. Payne (1837â1885), who became the mayor of Cleveland.
* Oliver Hazard Payne (1839â1917), a Gilded Age businessman.
* Flora Payne (1842â1893), who married Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney.
* Henry Wilson Payne (1845â1878), who graduated from Columbia Law School in May 1870; died in poor health.
* Elisha Howard Payne (1851â1852), who died young.
* Mary Perry Payne (1854â1898), who married Charles William Bingham (1846â1929).

Payne died in Cleveland on September 9, 1896, at the age of eighty-five. He is interred in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. His descendants continued to be involved in Ohio politics. In addition to his sons Oliver and Nathan, his son-in-law was Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney of the politically prominent Whitney family. Payne was the maternal grandfather of Frances P. Bolton and great-grandfather of Oliver Payne Bolton, both of whom later served in the United States House of Representatives. The village of Payne, Ohio was named in his honor. He was also the great-grandfather of Michael Whitney Straight, a confessed spy for the KGB.

<doc id="712848" wikidata="Q1588047" url="?curid=712848" title="Alan Trammell">
<text>Alan Stuart Trammell ( ; born February 21, 1958) is an American former professional baseball shortstop, manager and coach and member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a player. His entire 20-year playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB) was with the Detroit Tigers. Trammell has served as a special assistant to the General Manager of the Detroit Tigers since the 2014 season.

Trammell won a World Series championship in over his hometown San Diego Padres, earning Series MVP honors, and an American League East division championship in 1987. Although his arm was not overpowering, he had a quick release and made accurate throws, ultimately winning four Gold Glove awards. Trammell&#x27;s defense perfectly complemented his double-play partner, Lou Whitaker. The two formed the longest continuous double-play combination in major league history, playing 19 seasons together. At the plate, Trammell was one of the best-hitting shortstops of his era and won three Silver Slugger awards.

Trammell later served as the Tigers&#x27; manager from 2003 through 2005. He also served as the interim manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks during the final three games of the 2014 season. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Playing career==

===Early years===
Trammell attended Kearny High School in San Diego, California, and played American Legion Baseball. He was named the 1989 American Legion Graduate of the Year.

The Detroit Tigers selected him in the second round of the 1976 MLB draft.

While playing for the Tigers&#x27; farm team in Montgomery of the Southern League, Trammell played his first game with teammate Lou Whitaker before the two infielders were promoted, making their major league debut at Fenway Park together, during the second game of a double-header on September 9, 1977, the first of nineteen seasons together. Both players became regulars at their positions the following season.

Trammell batted .300 in 1980 as he made the All-Star team for the first time. In 1983, he batted .319 with 14 home runs, 66 runs batted in and 30 stolen bases. Having hit .258 in both 1981 and 1982, Trammell won the 1983 MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award in the American League.

Trammell and Whitaker made a cameo appearance on the television show &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, starring Tom Selleck, during the 1983 season. Selleck&#x27;s character, Thomas Magnum, was a Tigers fan (as is Selleck himself).

===1984===
The Tigers enjoyed a championship-winning season in 1984, when they started the season 35â5 and led the American League wire-to-wire en route to winning the World Series. Despite a season-long battle with tendinitis in his shoulder which caused him to miss 23 regular season games, Trammell finished fifth in the AL batting race with a .314 mark and ranked eighth in on-base percentage (.382). In the 1984 American League Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals, he hit .364 with one home run and three RBI. Finally, in the World Series, he hit .450 (9-for-20) against the San Diego Padres, including a pair of two-run home runs that accounted for all of the Tigers&#x27; scoring in a Game 4 victory. Detroit won the series 4â1 and Trammell was named World Series MVP.

===1985â1988===
In 1985, after two consecutive years of batting not lower than .314, Trammell was hampered by injuries and posted only a .258 batting average. He underwent postseason surgery on his left knee and right shoulder. The following season, a fully healthy Trammell hit 21 homers and stole 25 bases, becoming only the second player in Detroit history to hit 20+ home runs and steal 20+ bases in the same season. (Kirk Gibson was the other, while Curtis Granderson and Robbie Grossman later joined the club.) Trammell also set a career-high with 75 RBI.

In 1987, asked by manager Sparky Anderson to replace the departed Lance Parrish as cleanup hitter, Trammell responded with his best major league season, hitting a career-high 28 home runs to go with a career-high .343 batting average (ranking third in the AL). In addition, Trammell appeared among the league leaders in most other AL offensive categories: third in hits (205), tenth in RBI (105), tied for fifth in runs (109), fourth in total bases (329), fifth in on-base percentage (.402), eighth in slugging average (.551), sixth in on-base plus slugging (.953), fifth in OPS+ (155), and tied for fifth in game-winning RBI (16). In September, he batted .416 with six homers and 17 RBI and put together an 18-game hitting streak in which he hit .457. On the penultimate day of the regular season, he hit a walk-off single against the Toronto Blue Jays to help his team take the AL East division lead, which they clinched the next day. He became the first Tiger to collect 200 hits and 100 RBI in the same season since Al Kaline did it in 1955. Trammell also became the first shortstop to hit at least .340 with 20+ home runs and 100+ RBI in a season in big league history. Despite his efforts, Trammell finished second to Toronto&#x27;s George Bell in the MVP voting (332â311). After the season finale, Whitaker gave him second base, on which he had written: &quot;To Alan Trammell, 1987 Most Valuable Player, from your friend Lou Whitaker.&quot;

Trammell followed up with a .311 season in 1988, though a stint on the disabled list limited him to 128 games that year.

===Later years, injuries and retirement===

Following the 1990 season, in which he hit .304 with 89 RBI in 146 games, Trammell suffered a long string of injuries that reduced his production over his final years. In 1991, knee and ankle injuries limited Trammell to 101 games. During the following season, he played in 29 games before breaking his right ankle and missing the remainder of the 1992 season. He hit .329 in a resurgent 1993 season but was ineligible to be ranked among the AL batting leaders because he only had 447 plate appearances. In his final five seasons, Trammell averaged 76 games played after averaging 140 games played the first 13 seasons of his career. From 1993 to 1996, Trammell saw less time at shortstop in favor of Travis Fryman and eventually Chris Gomez and AndÃºjar CedeÃ±o. He instead saw playing time at multiple defensive positions, including shortstop, third base, second base, left field, center field, and designated hitter. Trammell retired following the 1996 season.

In his 20-year career, Trammell batted over .300 seven times, ending with a career average of .285 and 185 home runs with 1,003 RBI, 1,231 runs, 2,365 hits, 412 doubles, 55 triples, 236 stolen bases and 850 walks in 2,293 games. He compiled a .977 fielding percentage at shortstop, his primary position.

After his retirement, Trammell coached for Detroit (1999, hitting coach), the San Diego Padres (2000â2002, first base coach), and managed the Tigers (2003â2005). He served as the bench coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks under former teammate Kirk Gibson until returning to the Tigers in late 2014 as a special assistant to the general manager.

In 2001, Trammell was rated as the ninth-best shortstop of all time in &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, placing him higher than fourteen Hall of Fame shortstops. In subsequent years, Trammell&#x27;s candidacy for the Hall of Fame picked up increasing support from the sabermetric community. In his first 12 years of eligibility, he received the following percentage of votes: 15.7% (2002), 14.1% (2003), 13.8% (2004), 16.9% (2005), 17.7% (2006), 13.4% (2007), 18.2% (2008), 17.4% (2009), 22.4% (2010), 24.3% (2011), 36.8% (2012), 33.6% (2013), and 20.8% (2014). His boost in later years was likely due to voters being more receptive to advanced metrics, such as WAR (Wins above replacement).

Trammell was on his 15th and final Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America ballot in 2016, failing to earn enough for induction. Trammell was one of the last candidates to be allowed on the ballot for 15 years after the BBWAA reduced eligibility to ten years, and would next be considered for the Veterans Committee Expansion starting from 2017. On December 10, 2017, he was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Modern Baseball Committee alongside his teammate Jack Morris. They were inducted in July 2018.

In 1998, Trammell was elected into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.

===Jersey number retirement===

Alan Trammell&#x27;s jersey #3 was retired by the Tigers in a ceremony on August 26, 2018. His name and number were added to the brick wall in left-center field at Comerica Park, alongside Charlie Gehringer (#2), Hank Greenberg (#5), Al Kaline (#6), Sparky Anderson (#11), Hal Newhouser (#16), Willie Horton (#23), Ty Cobb (no number) and Jack Morris (#47). Jackie Robinson&#x27;s #42 was retired throughout baseball in 1997. Double-play mate Lou Whitaker had his #1 retired in 2022, and it now fittingly stands to the right of Trammel&#x27;s on the outfield wall.

==Managerial and coaching career==

===Detroit Tigers===
Alan Trammell was named the manager of a struggling Tigers team on October 9, 2002. The team lost 119 games in his first season in 2003, an American League record, before posting a 72â90 record in 2004. In the 2005 season, however, the team&#x27;s record regressed slightly, finishing 71â91. During Trammell&#x27;s three years as manager, the Tigers compiled a record of 186â300.

During the 2003 season, Detroit nearly matched the modern MLB record of 120 losses, set by the expansion New York Mets (40â120) in 1962. The Tigers won five of their last six games to avoid the distinction.

On October 3, 2005, the Tigers released Trammell after three seasons in which the organization failed to post a winning record. Trammell was replaced by Jim Leyland on October 4, 2005. Leyland led Detroit to a 24-game improvement in the regular season, an AL pennant, and a World Series appearance in 2006. While there was some media criticism regarding Trammell&#x27;s managerial strategies and &quot;nice&quot; demeanor, others contend that he was a rookie manager put in charge of a team that was severely lacking in talent, and believe his managerial stint played an integral role in re-instilling professionalism and pride throughout the Detroit organization. Leyland himself attributed a degree of the success that the Tigers saw in the 2006 postseason to Trammell&#x27;s efforts in the three years prior.

In October 2006, Trammell returned to Comerica Park for the first time since his firing to participate, along with Sparky Anderson, in pregame festivities prior to Game 2 of the World Series. Trammell was showered with a lengthy standing ovation from Detroit baseball fans upon taking the field.

===Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks===

After being replaced by Leyland, Trammell turned down an offer to stay with the Tigers as a special assistant, instead opting to sit out 2006. In October 2006, he agreed to join the Chicago Cubs as a bench coach for the 2007 season, a possible precursor to an eventual return to managing a major league club.

During the four-game suspension of Lou Piniella in 2007, Trammell was acting manager of the Chicago Cubs.

Trammell was passed over for the Cubs&#x27; managerial position when Lou Piniella retired midway through the 2010 season.

Trammell was named bench coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks in October 2010 joining his former teammate Kirk Gibson who had earlier been named manager. Gibson had previously been Trammell&#x27;s bench and hitting coach with the Tigers. He and Gibson were fired on September 26, 2014, though Trammell stayed on for the final three games of the season to serve as the interim manager. He had a record of one win and two losses in those three games.

===Return to Detroit Tigers===
On November 3, 2014, it was announced that Trammell would return to Detroit as a special assistant to Tigers&#x27; general manager Dave Dombrowski. During the 2015 season Trammell served as interim first-base coach when Omar Vizquel temporarily left the team on bereavement leave. He wore #4 during this time as Ian Kinsler was wearing Trammell&#x27;s familiar #3. Trammell continued to serve as a special assistant to Tigers&#x27; GM Al Avila until Avila was dismissed in August 2022, and Avila was replaced as GM by Jeff Greenberg in September 2023, with Trammell continuing to serve.

<doc id="712862" wikidata="Q3116453" url="?curid=712862" title="Grendel (comics)">
<text>Grendel is a long-running series of comic books originally created by American author Matt Wagner. First published in 1982 by , Wagner later moved publication of the series to Dark Horse. Originally a noir comic in the style of European titles such as &quot;Diabolik&quot;, it has evolved into, in Wagner&#x27;s words, a study of the nature of aggression. In 2009, Hunter Rose (the first Grendel) was ranked as IGN&#x27;s 88th-greatest villain of all time.

== Overview ==
Grendel was the masked identity of Hunter Rose, a successful author. As Grendel, he worked as an assassin before taking control of New York City&#x27;s organized crime. He first appeared in October 1982 in the anthology &quot;Comico Primer&quot;, and was given his own series in 1983. This was quickly cancelled due to the publisher&#x27;s financial troubles. Wagner owned the character, however, so he used the opportunity to re-tell the story of Hunter Rose in a far less conventional style in &quot;Grendel: Devil by the Deed&quot;, serialized as a backup story in Wagner&#x27;s series &quot;Mage&quot;; this was subsequently collected as a 48-page one-shot.

There followed an ongoing series which lasted 40 issues. It was written by Wagner and drawn by a variety of artists, including the Pander Brothers, Bernie Mireault, Tim Sale, John K. Snyder III and others. It began with a story set in the near future, with Christine Spar, Hunter&#x27;s posthumous biographer, assuming the identity of Grendel to pursue a mission of revenge. The identity passed briefly, and tragically, to her deluded boyfriend Brian Li Sung. After a brief return to stories of Hunter Rose (actually two in-universe fictional novels written by Captain Wiggins, a supporting character from the Christine Spar arc), Wagner then spun the series further into the future, with the Grendel identity affecting a variety of people. The name Grendel took on several meanings as the stories portrayed a dystopian future. Grendel became a synonym for The Devil with the title held by the emperor of the world (Grendel-Khan) and members of a warrior society identical to samurai.

The publishing rights languished for several years after &#x27;s bankruptcy, but &quot;Grendel&quot; resurfaced at Dark Horse Comics with the ten-part series &quot;Grendel: War Child&quot;, written by Wagner. Dark Horse subsequently launched &quot;Grendel Tales&quot;, stories set in the world established by Wagner, created by other writers and artists, including Darko Macan and Edvin BiukoviÄ. The main story has also continued in novel form, written by Greg Rucka.

In the years since the publishing of &quot;War Child&quot;, Wagner has occasionally written short stories featuring Hunter Rose. In 2007, he launched an eight-issue miniseries, &quot;Behold the Devil&quot;, which reveals a secret of the character. In 2019, Wagner released &quot;Devil&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, returning to the dystopian future of Grendel-Prime.

== Publication history ==
===The early stories===

&quot;Comico Primer&quot; #2 (Oct. 1982) contained the first &quot;Grendel&quot; story, introducing debonair master-criminal Hunter Rose and his nemesis, Argent the wolf. Grendel soon got his own black-and-white title, published by , which lasted three issues. It ended prematurely, mid-story, because of Comico&#x27;s financial issues. Wagner considers these stories a &quot;rough draft&quot;. These issues, along with the aforementioned Grendel story from &quot;Comico Primer&quot; #2, were collected for the first time ever in the &quot;Grendel Archives&quot; collection in 2007, just in time for the 25th anniversary of the publication of the first Grendel story. The collection included an introduction by Wagner explaining the situation which led to the creation of Grendel, and dismissing rumors that he was unhappy to have the early work available.

===Devil by the Deed===
As a backup story in his other series, &quot;Mage&quot; (1984â1986), appearing from issues 6 to 14, Wagner reworked and retold Hunter Rose&#x27;s story in its entirety. It was collected by Comico in 1986. A new edition, recolored by Bernie Mireault, was published by Dark Horse in 1993. In 2007, it was released in hardcover colored only in black, white, and red. In 2023, a âMaster&#x27;s Editionâ was released by Dark Horse, expanding the story from 37 pages to 120.

The story begins with an extraordinarily gifted boy named Eddie. Because victory in his endeavors comes so easily, it all seems meaningless. In despair, he throws a world-championship fencing match and becomes romantically involved with Jocasta Rose, a trainer twice his age. When Jocasta dies, Eddie leaves behind his life and takes on two new identities: Hunter Rose, successful novelist and socialite, and Grendel, elegant costumed assassin and later crime boss. Grendel is hunted relentlessly by Argent, a several hundred year old Native American man-wolf cursed with a thirst for violence. Argent works with the police in an effort to turn his curse to good.

Hunter Rose later adopts Stacy Palumbo, the young daughter of a mobster he killed. Stacy also befriends Argent. Hunter is a loving father to Stacy, but she betrays him to Argent when she discovers that he is Grendel. Grendel and the wolf fight on the roof of a Masonic temple. The battle results in Argent&#x27;s paralysis and Grendel&#x27;s death and unmasking. The police discover Stacy&#x27;s role in this incident and that she murdered a governess to prevent interference with her plan. Developing severe psychological problems, Stacy is committed to a mental hospital until adulthood. After she is released, she marries her psychiatrist, but on their wedding night he rapes her and then commits suicide. The traumatic experience is enough that Stacy returns to institutionalization for the rest of her life. After she returns to the institution, she gives birth to a daughter named Christine Spar.

Christine Spar later publishes a biography of Hunter Rose and his life as Grendel, the source of the excerpts seen throughout the comics, which she entitles &quot;Devil by the Deed&quot;. It becomes a bestseller and makes Grendel a pop culture icon.

===Grendel â the series===
The ongoing &quot;Grendel&quot; series was published by Comico from 1986 to 1990, with Wagner as writer (and occasionally drawing short story arcs) collaborating with a variety of artists. This series was nominated for an Eisner Awards for Best Continuing Series, Best Single Issue (#12), earned Matt Wagner a nomination for Best Writer, and the Pander Brothers &amp; Jay Geldof a nomination for Best Art Team. The first fifteen issues relate different stories of people who are inspired by their circumstances to assume the identity of Grendel, a choice which seems destined to end in tragedy. There is a recurring idea that these people are influenced by the Grendel identity as if it&#x27;s a force or entity that chooses to possess them.

==== Issues #1â12: Devil&#x27;s Legacy ====

A collected edition was published by Comico in 1988. Dark Horse re-published &quot;Devil&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, recolored by Jeromy Cox, as a 12-issue miniseries in 2000 and a collected edition in 2002.

The first twelve issues, written and colored by Wagner and drawn by Arnold and Jacob Pander, were set in the near future and told the story of Stacy Palumbo&#x27;s daughter, Christine Spar. Christine&#x27;s son Anson is kidnapped by a vampire Kabuki dancer, Tujiro XIV. She takes on the identity of Grendel to rescue her child or avenge him, if necessary. The longer she operates as Grendel, Christine&#x27;s behavior and personality become increasingly violent.

The new Grendel&#x27;s activities draw the attention of the NYPD, in particular Captain Wiggins, whose cybernetic eye acts as a lie detector. Wiggins enlists the aid of Hunter Rose&#x27;s arch-enemy Argent. Eventually, Christine and Argent fight, resulting in both of their deaths.

==== Issues #13â15: The Devil Inside ====
Issues #13â15 were written by Wagner, drawn by Bernie Mireault, and colored by Wagner, Mireault and Joe Matt. A collected edition was published by Comico in 1990. It was republished as a miniseries by Dark Horse in 2001 and a collected edition in 2004.

The story follows directly from &quot;Devil&#x27;s Legacy&quot; and focuses on Brian Li Sung, the stage manager with Tujiro&#x27;s Kabuki group who met and romanced Christine Spar during her time as Grendel. After Spar&#x27;s death, Captain Wiggins hounds Brian. Wiggins believes Brian can lead him to Christine&#x27;s journals and secrets they hold about Grendel. Brian becomes increasingly confused and irrational, believing the spirit of Grendel is telling him to take action.

Brian finally adopts the Grendel identity and then attempts to murder Wiggins. During the battle, Brian Li Sung&#x27;s true personality reasserts control and denies the influence of the spirit of Grendel, giving Wiggins the opportunity to shoot and kill him.

==== Issues #16â19: Devil Tracks and Devil Eyes ====
When Bernie Mireault asked Wagner if Grendel could ever inhabit a crowd, Wagner was inspired to re-imagine the whole series. Starting with #16, he broke from the &quot;next person puts on the mask&quot; theme that connected the previous stories and instead had Captain Wiggins relate untold tales of Hunter Rose. &quot;Devil Tracks&quot; appeared in &quot;Grendel&quot; #16â17; &quot;Devil Eyes&quot; appeared in &quot;Grendel&quot; #18â19. Both were written and drawn by Wagner. Dark Horse republished them as a two-issue miniseries, &quot;Grendel Classics: Devil Tracks&quot; and &quot;Grendel Classics: Devil Eyes&quot;, in 1995, and collected them as &quot;Grendel: Devil Tales&quot; in 1999, now out of print.

The now-retired Captain Wiggins is asked to write about his experiences concerning Brian Li Sung and Christine Spar decades earlier. Not wishing to dredge up old ghosts from his past, Wiggins decides instead to tell stories concerning Hunter Rose, the original Grendel whom he never met. One story centers on NYPD Lt. Lewis Polk, who investigates a diamond smuggling operation supposedly engineered by Rose. Another story told by Wiggins expands on informant Tommy Nuncio, a character briefly mentioned in &quot;Devil by the Deed&quot;.

====Issues #20â23: The Incubation Years====
These four issues feature one-off stories, each taking place further into the future. They were written by Wagner and drawn by Hannibal King and Tim Sale. According to Dark Horse editor Diana Schutz and creator Matt Wagner, the original art for issues #20â22 had deteriorated to the point where the issues could not be reprinted. They were eventually reprinted in the third &quot;Grendel Omnibus&quot;.

After publishing stories of Hunter Rose (the same stories featured in issues #16â19), Captain Wiggins has become wealthy and famous. Christine Spar&#x27;s earlier biography of Hunter Rose made Grendel a pop culture icon and now Wiggins&#x27;s work has revived interest in the figure, making him a household name once more.

Wiggins then becomes concerned when the vision in his cybernetic eye becomes distorted, making others (including his new young wife) appear as grotesque caricatures. Physicians conclude the distortion is a result of stress brought on by newfound celebrity. Wiggins concludes that his lie-detector eye has become enhanced and now reveals the true ugliness of the world and that he is surrounded by greedy, shallow people who covet his fame and wealth. As his anger and paranoia increase, Wiggins is finally enraged by his wife&#x27;s nagging and murders her. After his rage subsides, he calmly waits for the police to arrest him.

The following three issues are more experimental than previous issues of the series, depicting the growth of the concept of Grendel from pop-culture villain to synonym for Satan, against a background of political upheaval, social breakdown, nuclear war and environmental catastrophe. Over the four issues, it is made implicit that &#x27;Grendel&#x27; is indeed a malevolent spirit and he acts as the narrator, mocking the frailties of the characters and explaining how their actions benefit him.

==== Issues #24â33: God and the Devil ====
&quot;God and the Devil&quot;, written by Wagner, drawn by John K. Snyder III and Jay Geldhof and colored by Joe Matt, ran in &quot;Grendel&quot; #24â33 and takes place during the 26th century. It was republished as a ten-issue miniseries, recolored by Jeromy Cox, by Dark Horse in 2003. A trade-paper collection of all 10 issues was published in 2008.

In the 26th century, much of Earth is contaminated and unfit for life. America is fragmented into a number of corporate &quot;systems&quot; dominated by a corrupt Catholic Church, now based in &quot;Vatican Ouest&quot; in Colorado and led by Pope Innocent XLII, who is greedily taxing resources to build a huge, ostentatious tower. Unknown to the public, Pope Innocent XLII is actually the vampire Tujiro, who centuries ago inspired Christine Spar to become the second Grendel and whose associate Brian Li Sung became the third Grendel. The true purpose of the Pope&#x27;s new tower is not pride but to house a weapon called the Sun Gun, which will block sunlight from reaching Earth.

Orion Assante, a corporate auditor and wealthy aristocrat, tries to work within the system to stem the Church&#x27;s financial corruption. Meanwhile, a factory worker named Eppy Thatcher becomes corrupted by a designer drug called Grendel. Convinced that God hates him and fueled by the drug, Thatcher becomes the new Grendel and acts as an anti-Church terrorist. Orion Assante feels his efforts to fight the Vatican&#x27;s corruption are overshadowed by this terrorist who uses a blasphemous costume and alias (as &quot;Grendel&quot; has now long been associated as another name for the Devil).

To combat this threat, the Church establishes a second Inquisition. Pellon Cross, head of the mercenary Confederacy Of Police (COP), is hired to provide added security. Tujiro uses Cross to retrieve materials needed to complete the Sun Gun. As an afterthought, he turns Cross into a vampire servant.

As the story goes on, Orion Assante is driven to desperation following the deaths of his loved ones and leads a private army to destroy the Sun Gun. Pellon Cross escapes Tujiro&#x27;s clutches and turns a number of his fellow COPs into vampires, enlisting their allegiance against the Pope. Thatcher, Pellon&#x27;s vampires and Orion&#x27;s army all attack the Vatican tower and it is destroyed before the Sun Gun is activated. Tujiro and Thatcher apparently perish in the process.

==== Issues #34â40: Devil&#x27;s Reign ====
&quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot;, written by Wagner, drawn by Sale and colored by Mireault, ran in &quot;Grendel&quot; #34â40. &quot;Grendel&quot; went on what was intended to be temporary hiatus, but Comico&#x27;s subsequent bankruptcy meant instead that this story was now the close of the series. It was republished as a seven-issue miniseries, recolored by Matt Hollingsworth, by Dark Horse in 2004. A trade-paper collection of all seven issues was released in 2008. It follows the events of &quot;God and the Devil&quot;, taking place in the 26th century.

Following the destruction of the Church, much of society crumbles. A community of vampires, led by Pellon Cross, establishes itself in the sovereign nation of VEGAS. Orion Assante, using his corporate connections and private wealth, gradually restores order through use of his army and a broadcasting network, both called &quot;Orion&#x27;s Sword&quot;. For his role in bringing down the Church, Orion is nicknamed &quot;Grendel&quot; by others.

In securing its borders, the newly united North America absorbs South America, Central America and Australia, presenting these conquests as corporate mergers. Other world powers, including China, Japan and Africa, are alarmed.

On a state visit to Africa, the world&#x27;s only remaining nuclear power, Orion&#x27;s wife Sherri Caniff is abducted by an African nationalist faction. Suspecting African government involvement, Orion sends forces to simultaneously seize the nuclear silos and free Sherri. Once in control of Africa, Orion discovers that Japan was behind the kidnapping. A state of cold war develops, with corresponding military build-up.

The unauthorized conquests of territories in Asia by a renegade general brings Orion&#x27;s Sword to the borders of China. The formerly aloof superpower then allies with Japan and global war results. The war does not go well for Orion, as his forces are overstretched and suffer many setbacks and defeats. In the midst of this, Sherri Caniff dies of cancer.

Orion comes to believe he is actually possessed by the devil, by the spirit of Grendel. He disappears from public life and tracks down Eppy Thatcher, who is alive, hiding in the sewers beneath Vegas. Interrogating Eppy, Orion has an inspiration. Adapting the technology of Tujiro&#x27;s sun gun, Orion develops a new weapon called the Sun-Disk and devastates Japan. China surrenders, making Orion Assante ruler of Earth, Orion I.

Embracing his originally derogatory nickname, Assante names his personal troops &quot;Grendels&quot;, the title now indicative of high-status and respect. As their leader, Orion I adopts the title of &quot;Grendel-Khan&quot;. The spirit of Grendel has, in effect, conquered the world. To ensure he has an heir to the world he&#x27;s built, and unwilling to trust anyone else to do it for him, he uses advanced technology to impregnate himself and gives birth to a son, Jupiter.

Each part of the main story is presented as a history text written by Assante&#x27;s stepdaughter and panels with the characters are presented like archived footage. A more traditional approach was done on the backup strips, which depicted the history of the vampire community as a counterpoint to Assante&#x27;s rise.

===Silverback===
In 1989 &quot;Silverback&quot;, a three-issue miniseries written by Wagner and William Messner-Loebs and drawn by Messner-Loebs and John Peck, told the story of Argent the wolf&#x27;s origin in a tale based on Native American mythology. Wagner has said that, due to problems with the original source material, which has deteriorated over time, it is unlikely that this will ever be collected or reprinted in any way.

===Devil&#x27;s Whisper===
The short piece &quot;Devil&#x27;s Whisper&quot; was published in 1989 in A1 Book 4. It was written by James Robinson and drawn by D&#x27;Israeli. The story takes place in between issues 15 and 16, and concerns Captain Wiggins briefly wearing Brian Li Sung&#x27;s Grendel mask.

===War Child===

As &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; came to a close, Wagner thought of an idea for a new storyline, which was intended to run as &quot;Grendel&quot; #41â50, after a brief publishing hiatus. Before that could happen, though, Comico went bankrupt. Finally, after Wagner regained the publishing rights, &quot;Grendel: War Child&quot; saw print in 1992 as a 10-issue miniseries from Dark Horse, written by Wagner, drawn by Patrick McEown and colored by Mireault. A collected edition was published in 1994.

Ten years after the death of Orion I, his son Jupiter is kidnapped from his home/prison at a base in the Dakota Black Hills by a lone Grendel in full black body armor. This Grendel is known to others as the &quot;paladin&quot;, and later adopts the name of Grendel-Prime. Orion&#x27;s widow Laurel Kennedy, now regent, sends the empire&#x27;s elite soldiers known as Red Devils after the renegade Grendel and his hostage. In the process of her rulership, Laurel further neglects and alienates her daughter Crystal.

Jupiter and the Grendel paladin flee to the jungles of Africa. Along the way, they cross wastelands, ruined cities and oceans, encountering not only the Red Devils but also bandits, mutants, pirates, dangerous wildlife, and other Grendels (both friend and foe). In the OPEC wastes, Grendel and Jupiter are captured by a band of rebels opposed to Laurel Kennedy. Grendel-Prime is disassembled and revealed as a solar-powered cyborg created by Orion I to protect Jupiter from political manipulators until he is old enough to assume the throne of the Grendel-Khan.

Jupiter is abducted from the rebel base by a group of vampires who take him to their lair in Siberia. The rebels and their charismatic leader, Azif a-Barouk, accompany Grendel-Prime to rescue the boy. Grendel-Prime slays the vampires&#x27; lord in the processâwho turns out to be none other than Orion Assante&#x27;s old foe, Pellon Cross.

Laurel Kennedy&#x27;s rule is undermined by the lack of an heir, so she decides to arrange a suitable dynastic marriage for her daughter. But Crystal is having a secret affair with her Grendel guard, Susan Veraghen. Rather than be forced into marriage, Crystal escapes the Black Hills complex and flees into the wilderness. Laurel becomes increasingly irrational, and effective rule of the empire passes to her minister, Abner Heath.

Ten years later, Laurel Kennedy is quietly displaced and imprisoned by Abner Heath, who becomes the acting leader of Earth. To hold the empire together, Heath wants to activate the Sun-Disc, Orion&#x27;s most formidable weapon, but meets with continual failure. Finally, Jupiter (now a young man) and Grendel-Prime act against the empire. Grendel-Prime and his team capture the Imperial palace and Jupiter raids the Black Hills complex, encountering his now frail and sickly mother. It is discovered that the missing component of the Sun-Disk is contained within the body of Grendel-Prime. He activates the weapon and destroys the government&#x27;s broadcasting satellites, enabling Jupiter to take over the airwaves and announce his succession. After Jupiter&#x27;s coronation, Grendel-Prime takes his leave of Jupiter and disappears into the wastelands.

===Batman/Grendel I===
A two-part Batman/Grendel crossover, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Riddle&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Masque&quot;, was written and drawn by Wagner and colored by Wagner at the time of the Comico series, but was delayed by Comico&#x27;s bankruptcy. It was finally published by DC in 1993.

The story assumes that Hunter Rose and Batman live in the same fictional universe and are contemporaries. Bored with Argent the wolf and the NYPD, Hunter Rose comes to Gotham City to challenge Batman (as the city&#x27;s protector) to stop him before he commits an audacious crime. Rose becomes increasingly impressed with Batman but is still able to accomplish his crime. However, Batman&#x27;s interference proves to be more trouble than Rose expected. Grendel unintentionally endangers a child and indirectly causes the death of someone Grendel did not consider an enemy. Grendel and Batman&#x27;s final battle results in a broken arm for the assassin who barely escapes Gotham.

Returning to New York, Hunter Rose concludes that he should be satisfied with the challenges provided by Argent the wolf and the NYPD rather than risk further challenging the Batman and attracting his notice. Hunter Rose says that Batman is not a wolf but a tiger, indicating the hero is too dangerous and too much like himself to risk making a true enemy.

Although this story can be seen as out of continuity, Hunter Rose is depicted with a broken arm in the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; short, featured in &quot;Grendel: Black, White, &amp; Red&quot;.

===&quot;Grendel Tales&quot;===
&quot;Grendel Tales&quot; is an irregular series of stories by other writers and artists set in the world Wagner had created. It was intended to follow the original comic series, but Comico&#x27;s bankruptcy derailed this plan (&quot;Grendel&quot; #40 did contain a short story by Steven T. Seagle and Ho Che Anderson, starting this idea). &quot;Grendel Tales&quot; finally began in 1993, published by Dark Horse as a series of miniseries.
* &quot;Four Devils, One Hell&quot; by James Robinson and Teddy Kristiansen (1993) â This story features the skull of Hunter Rose. The skull has a hole in the forehead, though it is not explained in the story why this is. The reason is revealed in the 1996 Batman/Grendel crossover.
* &quot;Devil&#x27;s Hammer&quot; by Rob Walton (1994)
* &quot;The Devil in Our Midst&quot; by Steven T. Seagle and Paul Grist (1994)
* &quot;Devils and Deaths&quot; by Darko Macan and Edvin BiukoviÄ (1994)
* &quot;Homecoming&quot; by Patrick McEown (1994)
* &quot;Devil&#x27;s Choices&quot; by Darko Macan and Edvin BiukoviÄ (1995)
* &quot;The Devil May Care&quot; by Terry Laban and Peter Doherty (1995)
* &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; by Jeffrey Lang and Steve Lieber (1997)

===Devil Quest===
Wagner wrote and painted a series of short stories as backups in &quot;Grendel Tales&quot;, starting in 1994 and collected in 1995. A hardcover collection of the story was released in June 2008.

Set 104 years after &quot;War Child&quot;, these back-up stories feature the Grendel-Khan, Jupiter Assante III, as he attempts to find Grendel-Prime in the wastelands. The cyborg, disillusioned by the decadence of the world, is attempting a bloody experiment/ritual to contact the soul of Hunter Rose, his namesake.

The ritual seems to work and Grendel-Prime disappears. He later reappears some distance away, badly damaged. What happened when he vanished and why he was damaged was not explained until 1996 with the publication of the second Batman/Grendel crossover.

===Grendel Cycle===
In 1995, &quot;Grendel Cycle&quot; was published. It was a 64-page recap of Grendel&#x27;s history, written by Matt Wagner and with art pulled from issues of the original series. It also contained an all-new 8-page primer, written and painted by Wagner, showcasing various characters and events from the series; a timeline of the Grendel legacy, giving some new information about the characters; and a cover gallery for the 40-issue Comico series and the &quot;War Child&quot; miniseries.

===Batman/Grendel II===
The second two-part Batman/Grendel crossover, titled &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bones&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Dance&quot;, was published in 1996. It tied directly into events from &quot;Devil Quest&quot;. A collection of both Batman/Grendel stories was released in hardcover (limited to only 300 copies) and paperback in April 2008.

In the present day, a museum in Gotham City is holding an exhibition of famous murderers, including as its prize exhibit the bones of Hunter Rose, the assassin and crime lord Grendel. In the 26th century, Grendel-Prime&#x27;s experiment in the story &quot;Devil Quest&quot; sends him back in time. In the present day, Grendel-Prime materializes in the Gotham City museum, drawn by the &quot;true skull&quot; of his namesake Hunter Rose. With the aid of a kidnapped WayneTech engineer, Grendel-Prime builds a device that will return him to the 26th century and kill thousands in the process, a blood sacrifice to enable contact with Hunter Rose&#x27;s soul. Batman prevents Grendel-Prime from carrying out the sacrifice.

===&quot;Black, White and Red&quot; and &quot;Red, White and Black&quot;===
Wagner returned to Hunter Rose in 1998 with a four-issue miniseries, &quot;Grendel: Black, White and Red&quot;, featuring short stories drawn by an array of artists. As the title suggests, the stories were drawn in black and white with red spot-color. A second series, &quot;Grendel: Red, White and Black&quot;, followed in 2002. Some of the artists included D&#x27;Israeli, Duncan Fegredo, David Mack, Mike Allred, Teddy Kristiansen, Woodrow Phoenix, Chris Sprouse, Stan Sakai, Jill Thompson, Kelley Jones, Andi Watson, Ashley Wood and Michael Zulli and Stan Shaw.

The collected versions of these two limited series also contain several short Grendel stories Wagner had published over the years, such as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Vagary&quot; (a 16-page one-shot from the &quot;Comico Collection&quot; slipcase), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Week&quot; (from &quot;A Decade of Dark Horse&quot; #1), &quot;Midnight Looms&quot; [Scared of the Devil] (from &quot;Dark Horse Extra&quot; #49â50), and &quot;Devils Duel&quot; (from &quot;Dark Horse Maverick&quot; 2001).

===Devil Child===
In 1999 a two-part series, &quot;Grendel: Devil Child&quot;, written by Diana Schutz and drawn by Tim Sale, told the harrowing story of Stacy Palumbo and the birth of her daughter, Christine Spar. A hardcover collection of the story was released in June 2008.

=== Past Prime ===
In 2000, &quot;Grendel: Past Prime&quot;, a novel written by Greg Rucka with illustrations by Wagner, was published, following the adventures of Grendel-Prime and Susan Veraghen after the assassination of Jupiter I.
=== Behold the Devil ===
In July 2007, Dark Horse debuted the new Hunter Rose series &quot;Grendel: Behold the Devil&quot; with a 50Â¢ #0 issue. This was released during 2007, the 25th anniversary of Grendel. The first issue hit comic stands in November. The series ran eight issues (nine including #0).

=== Sympathy from the Devil ===
In October 2011, Grendel appeared in the CBLDF&#x27;s fundraising Liberty Annual in a story addressing the book&#x27;s &quot;It Gets Better&quot; theme.

=== Grendel vs. The Shadow ===
Dark Horse and Dynamite Comics published a three-issue prestige format series featuring a team-up with Grendel and The Shadow entitled &quot;Grendel vs. The Shadow&quot;, starting in September 2014, written and drawn by Matt Wagner.

=== Devil&#x27;s Odyssey ===
Dark Horse announced a new eight-issue miniseries to be written and drawn by Matt Wagner. The series premiered in October 2019 and features the further adventures of Grendel Prime as he searches for a planet to be a new home for humanity. After a year long delay, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the final issue was published in July 2021 and a collection was published in December 2021.

=== Devil&#x27;s Crucible ===
An upcoming trilogy of four-issue mini-series was announced at the end of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;: &quot;Devil&#x27;s Crucible - Defiance&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Crucible - Sedition&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Crucible - Necrotic&quot;.

===Omnibus collections===
==Reception==
Martin A. Stever reviewed &quot;Grendel&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 83. Stever commented that &quot;this is one of the most exciting, dynamic, and unusual comic books ever conceived&quot;.

==In other media==
Netflix announced in September 2021 a television series adaptation with Andrew Dabb as showrunner and Abubakr Ali cast as Hunter Rose / Grendel. Other actors include Jaime Ray Newman as Jocasta Rose, Julian Black Antelope as Argent, Madeline Zima as Liz Sparks, Kevin Corrigan as Barry Palumbo, Emma Ho as Stacy Palumbo, Erik Palladino as Teddy Ciccone, Brittany Allen as Annabelle Wright and Andy Mientus as Larry Stohler.

<text>Israel Finkelstein (; born March 29, 1949) is an Israeli archaeologist, professor emeritus at Tel Aviv University and the head of the School of Archaeology and Maritime Cultures at the University of Haifa. Finkelstein is active in the archaeology of the Levant and is an applicant of archaeological data in reconstructing biblical history. Finkelstein is the current excavator of Megiddo, a key site for the study of the Bronze and Iron Ages in the Levant.

Finkelstein is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities an &quot;associÃ© Ã©tranger&quot; of the French AcadÃ©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2005, he won the Dan David Prize for his study of the history of Israel in the 10th and 9th centuries BCE. In 2009 he was named &quot;chevalier&quot; of the &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; by the French Minister of Culture, and in 2010, received a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Lausanne. He is a member of the selection committee of the Shanghai Archaeology Forum, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Among Finkelstein&#x27;s books are &quot;The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology&#x27;s New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of its Sacred Texts&quot; (2001) and &quot;David and Solomon: In Search of the Bible&#x27;s Sacred Kings and the Roots of the Western Tradition&quot; (2006), co-written with Neil Asher Silberman. Also he wrote the textbooks on the emergence of Ancient Israel, titled &quot;The Archaeology of the Israelite Settlement&quot; (1988); on the archaeology and history of the arid zones of the Levant, titled &quot;Living on the Fringe&quot; (1995); and on the Northern Kingdom of Israel, titled &quot;The Forgotten Kingdom&quot; (2013). Other books deal with biblical historiography: &quot;Hasmonean Realities Behind Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles&quot; (2018), &quot;Essays on Biblical Historiography: From Jeroboam II to John Hyrcanus&quot; (2022), and &quot;Jerusalem The Center of the Universe&quot; (2024).

== Background ==
=== Family ===
Israel Finkelstein was born to an Ashkenazi Jewish family in Tel Aviv, Israel, on March 29, 1949. His parents were Zvi (Grisha) Finkelstein (born 1908) and Miriam Finkelstein (maiden name Ellenhorn, born 1910). His great-grandfather on his mother&#x27;s side, Shlomo Ellenhorn, came to Palestine from Grodno (today in Belarus) in the 1850s and settled in Hebron. He was one of the first physicians in the Bikur Cholim Hospital in Jerusalem, and is listed among the group of people who purchased the land in 1878 in order to establish Petah Tikva â the first modern Jewish settlement in Palestine outside the four holy cities. Finkelstein&#x27;s father was born in Melitopol (Ukraine). He came to Palestine with his family in 1920.

Finkelstein is married to Joelle (maiden name Cohen). They are the parents of two daughters.

===Education===
Israel Finkelstein attended the PICA elementary school (1956â1963) and Ahad Ha&#x27;am High School (1963â1967), both in Petah Tikva. He then served in the Israel Defense Forces (1967â1970). He studied archaeology and Near Eastern civilizations, and geography at Tel Aviv University, receiving his BA in 1974. While there, Finkelstein was a student of Prof. Yohanan Aharoni. He continued as a research student under the supervision of Prof. Moshe Kochavi, receiving his MA in 1978 (thesis on Rural Settlement in the Yarkon Basin in the Iron Age and Persian-Hellenistic Periods). He graduated as a PhD in 1983 with a thesis titled &quot;The Izbet Sartah Excavations and the Israelite Settlement in the Hill Country&quot;.

== Academic career ==
From 1976 to 1990, Finkelstein taught at the Department of Land of Israel Studies, Bar-Ilan University, beginning as a teaching assistant. He spent the academic year of 1983â84 in a research group led by Prof. Yigael Yadin in the Institute of Advanced Studies in the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. In 1986/1987, Finkelstein taught at the Department for Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, University of Chicago. In 1987 he was appointed an associate professor with tenure at Bar-Ilan University and in 1990 moved to the Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Civilizations at Tel Aviv University. In 1992/93 Finkelstein spent a sabbatical year as a visiting scholar at the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Harvard University. Since 1992, he has been a Full Professor at Tel Aviv University. He served as the chairperson of the Department of Archaeology and Near Eastern Studies (1994â98) and as Director of The Sonia and Marco Nadler Institute of Archaeology (1996â2003). In 1998â99 Finkelstein was a visiting scholar in the Centre de Recherche d&#x27;ArchÃ©ologie Orientale and the Ãcole Pratique des Hautes Ãtudes in the Sorbonne, Paris.

Finkelstein was the editor of &quot;Tel Aviv&quot;, the journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University (2008-2021), and the executive editor of the Monograph Series by the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University (2005-2021). He is a member of editorial boards, including the Palestine Exploration Quarterly and the Archaeology and Biblical Studies series of the Society of Biblical Literature.

== Fieldwork ==

Finkelstein was trained as a field archaeologist in the excavations of Tel Beer Sheva (1971, Director: Yohanan Aharoni) and Tel Aphek (1973â1978, Directors: Moshe Kochavi and Pirhiya Beck). Starting in 1976, he carried out his own fieldwork in a variety of sites and regions:

=== Past excavations and surveys ===
In 1976-1978, he field-directed (under Prof. Moshe Kochavi) the excavations at &#x27;Izbet Sartah, an Iron I-Iron IIA village-site east of Tel Aviv (for the results see I. Finkelstein, Izbet Sartah: An Early Iron Age Site near Rosh Ha&#x27;ayin, Israel, Oxford 1986). In the same years he conducted surveys of Byzantine monastic remains in southern Sinai (for the results see I. Finkelstein, Byzantine Monastic Remains in Southern Sinai, Dumbarton Oaks Papers 39, 1985, pp.Â 39â75), and directed salvage excavations at the mound of ancient Bene Beraq near Tel Aviv (for the results see I. Finkelstein, Soundings at Ancient Bene-Beraq, &#x27;Atiqot 10, 1990, pp.Â 29â40). In 1980, Finkelstein co-directed (together with I. Beit-Arieh and B. Cresson) the excavation of Tel Ira, an Iron II site in the Beer-sheba Valley (for the results see I. Finkelstein and I. Beit-Arieh, Area E, in I. Beit-Arieh, editor, Tel Ira: A Stronghold in the Biblical Negev, Tel Aviv 1999, pp.Â 67â96).

In the 1980s Finkelstein moved to projects in the highlands. He directed the excavation at biblical Shiloh, a site which features Middle Bronze, Late Bronze and Iron I remains (for the results see I. Finkelstein, editor, Shiloh: The Archaeology of a Biblical Site, Tel Aviv 1993). Another comprehensive project was the Southern Samaria Survey, which covered an area of ca. 1000Â km2 in the highlands north of Jerusalem (for the results see I. Finkelstein, Z. Lederman and S. Bunimovitz, Highlands of Many Cultures, The Southern Samaria Survey, The Sites, Tel Aviv 1997). In parallel, he carried out soundings at sites northeast of Jerusalem: Khirbet ed-Dawwara, an Iron I-early Iron IIA site in the desert fringe near Jerusalem (for the results see I. Finkelstein, Excavations at Kh. ed-Dawwara: An Iron Age Site Northeast of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv 17, 1990, pp.Â 163â208); and the Intermediate Bronze site of Dhahr Mirzbaneh (for the results see I. Finkelstein, The Central Hill Country in the Intermediate Bronze Age, Israel Exploration Journal 41, 1991, pp.Â 19â45).

Finkelstein&#x27;s most extensive field work is the excavation at Megiddo (1994âpresent: co-directors David Ussishkin until 2012, and Matthew J. Adams and Mario A.S. Martin since 2014). Megiddo is considered one of the most important Bronze and Iron Age sites in the Levant.

In 2006-2020, Finkelstein was co-director of excavations and geo-archaeology work in the Iron Age sites of Atar Haroa and Nahal Boqer, and the Intermediate Bronze Age sites of Mashabe Sade and En Ziq (with Ruth Shahack-Gross). For the results see R. Shahack-Gross and I. Finkelstein, Settlement Oscillations in the Negev Highlands Revisited: The Impact of Microarchaeological Methods, Radiocarbon 57/2, 2015, pp.Â 253â264.

In 2017-2019, Finkelstein co-directed the Shmunis Family Excavations at Kiriath-Jearim, a biblical site in the highlands west of Jerusalem associated with the Ark Narrative in the Book of Samuel (with Christophe Nicolle and Thomas RÃ¶mer, the College de France).

== Other projects ==
In 2009â2014, Finkelstein was principal investigator of a European Research Council-funded project titled Reconstructing Ancient Israel: The Exact and Life Sciences Perspectives (with Steve Weiner of the Weizmann Institute of Science as co-Principal Investigator). The project was organized into 10 tracks dealing with radiocarbon dating, ancient DNA, geoarchaeology, paleoclimate, petrography, metallurgy, daily mathematics, advanced imaging of ostraca, residue analysis and archaeozoology. Samples were taken from a large number of sites in Israel and Greece.

Another project focused on the petrography of the Amarna clay tablets (1997-2022 with Yuval Goren and Nadav Na&#x27;aman; the results were published in: Y. Goren, I. Finkelstein and N. Na&#x27;aman; &quot;Inscribed in Clay: Provenance Study of the Amarna Letters and other Ancient Near Eastern Texts&quot;, Tel Aviv 2004.

Other studies dealt with the paleoclimate of the Levant (2009â2019, with Dafna Langgut of Tel Aviv University and Thomas Litt of the University of Bonn); The Archaeological and Historical Realities behind the Pentateuch (2016â2019, with Konrad Schmid of the University of Zurich, Thomas RÃ¶mer and Christophe Nihan of the University of Lausanne and Oded Lipschits of Tel Aviv University); ancient DNA of animals and Humans (2009âpresent, with Meirav Meiri of Tel Aviv University, in cooperation with Joseph Maran and Philipp Stockhammer of the Universities of Heidelberg and Munich, Liran Carmel of the Hebrew University, and David Reich of Harvard University).

Another project is the study of &#x27;Digital Epigraphy&#x27;, in which algorithmic methods were introduced to the study of Iron Age Hebrew inscriptions, 2008âpresent, with Eli Piasetzky of Tel Aviv University. This study was later expanded, introducing computer science methods to the investigation of biblical texts (with Barak Sober of the Hebrew University and Eli Piasetzky of Tel Aviv University).

== Scholarly contributions ==
Finkelstein has written on a variety of topics, including the archaeology of the Bronze Age and the exact and life sciences contribution to archaeology. Much of his work has been devoted to the Iron Age and, more specifically, to questions related to the history of Ancient Israel.

=== Emergence of Ancient Israel ===
The classical theories on the emergence of Israel viewed the process as a unique event in the history of the region. Finkelstein suggested that it was a long-term process of a cyclical nature. He demonstrated that the wave of settlement in the highlands in the Iron Age I (-950 BCE) was the last in a series of such demographic developments â the first had taken place in the Early Bronze and the second in the Middle Bronze. The periods between these peaks were characterized by low settlement activity. Finkelstein explained these oscillations as representing changes along the sedentary/ pastoral-nomadic continuum, which were caused by socioeconomic and political dynamics. Hence, a big portion of the people who settled in the highlands in the early Iron Age were locals of a pastoral-nomadic background. Others, who originated from local sedentary background, moved to the highlands as a result of the Bronze Age collapse â which in turn was related to a long period of dry climate in -1100 BCE. Since eventually these groups formed the Northern Kingdom of Israel, they can be labeled &quot;Israelites&quot; as early as their initial settlement process. The same holds true for the contemporary settlement process in Transjordan and western Syria, which brought about the rise of Moab, Ammon and the Aramean kingdoms of the later phases of the Iron Age.

Finkelstein regards the biblical account on the Conquest of Canaan in the Book of Joshua as an ideological manifesto of the Deuteronomistic author/s of the late 7th century BCE, describing a &quot;conquest to be&quot; under King Josiah of Judah rather than a historical event at the end of the Bronze Age. He proposed that the original Conquest Account may have originated in the Northern Kingdom of Israel in the early 8th century BCE; it could have been influenced by memories of the turmoil that had taken place in the lowlands in the late Iron I (10th century BCE), rather than the end of the Late Bronze Age (late 12th century BCE).

=== The Low Chronology ===
Until the 1990s, the chronology of the Iron Age in the Levant had been anchored in the biblical account of the great United Monarchy of David and Solomon. Accordingly, the Iron I ended ca. 1000 BCE and the Iron IIA was dated from 1000 BCE until the campaign of Pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak) ca. 925 BCE. The two Iron IIA palaces at Megiddo were conceived as the material manifestation for the Solomonic Empire. While preparing for the excavations at Megiddo in the early 1990s, Finkelstein noticed difficulties in this scheme. Noteworthy among them is the appearance of similar traits of material culture at Megiddo in a layer that was dated to the time of King Solomon in the middle of the 10th century, and at Samaria and Jezreel in contexts dated to the time of the Omride Dynasty (of the Northern Kingdom of Israel) in the early 9th century BCE. To resolve these difficulties, Finkelstein proposed to &quot;lower&quot; the dates of the Iron Age strata in the Levant by several decades.

According to Finkelstein&#x27;s Low Chronology, the Iron Age I lasted until the middle of the 10th century BCE, while the Iron IIA is dated between the middle of the 10th century and ca. 800 BCE, if not slightly later. This means that the Megiddo palaces and other features which had traditionally been attributed to the time of King Solomon â features which date to the late Iron IIA â should indeed be associated with the endeavors of the Omride Dynasty in the first half of the 9th century BCE. A big debate ensued. Starting in the late 1990s, the focus of the discussion shifted to the interpretation of radiocarbon determinations for organic samples from key sites, such as Tel Rehov and Megiddo. All in all, the radiocarbon results put the Iron I/IIA transition ca. the middle of the 10th century (rather than 1000 BCE as had traditionally been proposed), and the Iron IIA/B transition in the early days of the 8th century (rather than ca. 925 BCE). These data have far-reaching implications far beyond the Levant, first and foremost for the chronology of the Aegean basin.

In parallel, and not directly connected, Finkelstein dealt with the chronology of Philistine pottery of the Iron Age I. The traditional theory fixed the appearance of Philistine pottery â and hence the settlement of the Philistines in the southern coastal plain of the Levant â in accordance with the confrontation between Ramses III and the Sea Peoples in the early 12th century BCE. In other words, Philistine pottery appears during the last phase of Egyptian rule in Canaan. Finkelstein proposed that the locally-made Monochrome pottery known from several sites in Philistia, which is widely understood as representing the earliest phase of Philistine settlement, should be dated after the withdrawal of Egypt from Canaan in the 1130s.

Finkelstein sees the biblical description of the time of David and Solomon as multilayered. He acknowledges the historicity of the founders of the Davidic Dynasty, places them in the 10th century BCE, and considers the possibility that the description of the rise of David to power conceals old memories of his activity as a leader of an Apiru-band that was active in the southern fringe of Judah. Yet, he sees the description of a great United Monarchy as an ideological construct that represents the ideology of late-monarchic author/s in the late 7th century BCE, first and foremost the pan-Israelite ideology of the days of King Josiah of Judah. According to him, the historical David and Solomon ruled over a small territory in the southern highlands â a territory not very different from that of Jerusalem of the Late Bronze Age. Finkelstein sees much of the description of King Solomon as representing realities from late monarchic times: First, from the later days of the Northern Kingdom (for instance, the reference to Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer in and to the stables, horses and chariots of Solomon). Second, from the time of King Manasseh of Judah in the early 7th century BCE, under Assyrian domination (for instance, the visit of the Queen of Sheba in Jerusalem). He understands the description of the Philistines in the Bible as portraying realities in Philistia in late-monarchic times.

=== &quot;New Canaan&quot; ===
Following the results of the excavations at Megiddo, Finkelstein argued that the material culture of the Iron I in the northern valleys continues that of the Late Bronze Age. In other words, the collapse of the Late Bronze city-states under Egyptian domination in the late 12th century BCE was followed by revival of some of the same centers and rise of others in the Iron I. He termed this phenomenon &quot;New Canaan&quot;. Accordingly, the major break in the material culture of Canaan took place at the end of the Iron I in the 10th century BCE rather than the end of the Late Bronze Age. Finkelstein associated the violent destruction of the revived city-states with the expansion of the highlanders (early Israelites). He suggested that memories of the turmoil in the lowlands in the late Iron I can be found in northern traditions regarding skirmishes with Canaanite cities which appear in the heroic stories in the Book of Judges.

=== The Northern Kingdom ===
Finkelstein dealt with a variety of themes related to the archeology and history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. He proposed that the first North Israelite territorial polity emerged in the Gibeon-Bethel plateau in the late Iron I and early Iron IIA. He found archaeological evidence for this in the system of fortified sites, such as Tell en-Nasbeh, Khirbet ed-Dawwara, et-Tell (&quot;Ai&quot;) and Gibeon. Historical evidence for the existence of this polity can be found in the campaign of Pharaoh Sheshonq I in this region in the middle-to-second half of the 10th century BCE. According to Finkelstein, positive memories in the Bible of the House of Saul, which originated from the North, represent this early Israelite entity. He suggested that this north Israelite polity ruled over much of the territory of the highlands, that it presented a threat to the interests of Egypt of the 22nd Dynasty in Canaan, and that it was taken over during the campaign of Sheshonq I.

Finkelstein proposed that in its early days, the Northern Kingdom (Jeroboam I and his successors) ruled over the Samaria Highlands, the western slopes of the Gilead and the area of the Jezreel Valley. The expansion of Israel further to the north came during the days of the Omride Dynasty in the first half of the 9th century BCE, and even more so in the time of Jeroboam II in the first half of the 8th century BCE. Finkelstein described the special features of Omride architecture and, with his Megiddo team, dealt with different subjects related to the material culture of the Northern Kingdom, such as metallurgy and cult practices.

Finkelstein also reflected on biblical traditions related to the Northern Kingdom, such as the Jacob cycle in Genesis (a study carried out with Thomas RÃ¶mer), the Exodus tradition, the heroic stories in the Book of Judges and remnants of royal traditions in the Books of Samuel and Kings. He suggested that these North Israelite traditions were first committed to writing in the days of Jeroboam II (first half of the 8th century BCE), that they were brought to Judah with Israelite refugees after the takeover of Israel by Assyria, and that they were later incorporated into the Judahite-dominated Bible. Finkelstein sees the biblical genre of deploying &quot;history&quot; in the service of royal ideology as emerging from Israel (the North) of the 8th century BCE.

=== Archaeology and history of Jerusalem ===
Finkelstein has recently dealt with the location of the ancient mound of Jerusalem (with Ido Koch and Oded Lipschits). The conventional wisdom sees that &quot;City of David&quot; ridge as the location of the original settlement of Jerusalem. Finkelstein and his colleagues argued that the &quot;City of David&quot; ridge does not have the silhouette of a mound; that it is located in topographical inferiority relative to the surrounding area; and that the archaeological record of the ridge does not include periods of habitation attested in reliable textual records. According to them, the most suitable location for the core of ancient Jerusalem is the Temple Mount. The large area of the Herodian platform (today&#x27;s Harem esh-Sharif) may conceal a mound of five hectares and more, which â similar to other capital cities in the Levant â included both the royal compound and habitation quarters. Locating the mound of Ancient Jerusalem on the Temple Mount resolves many of the difficulties pertaining to the &quot;City of David&quot; ridge.

According to Finkelstein, the history of Jerusalem in biblical times should be viewed in terms of three main phases:

Firstly, until the 9th century BCE, Jerusalem was restricted to the mound on the Temple Mount and ruled over a modest area in the southern highlands. Accordingly, Jerusalem of the time of David and Solomon can be compared to Jerusalem of the Amarna period in the 14th century BCE: it had the size of a typical highlands mound (for instance, Shechem), ruled over a restricted area, but still had impact beyond the highlands.

Secondly, the first expansion of Jerusalem came in the 9th century BCE, perhaps in its second half, when the town grew significantly in a southerly direction. Remains of the Iron IIA were unearthed south of al-Aqsa Mosque, above the Gihon Spring and to the south of the Dung Gate of the Old City. In parallel to this development, Judah expanded to the Shephelah in the west and Beer-sheba Valley in the south, and for the first time became a territorial kingdom rather than a city-state restricted to the highlands.

Thirdly, the most impressive phase in the settlement history of Jerusalem commenced in the late 8th century BCE and lasted until its destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. At that time Jerusalem expanded dramatically, to include the entire &quot;City of David&quot; ridge, as well as the &quot;Western Hill&quot; (the Armenian and Jewish Quarter of today&#x27;s Old City). This expansion was the result of the arrival of Israelite refugees after the demise of the Northern Kingdom in 722â720 BCE. These groups brought with them traits of Northern material culture, and more important â their foundation myths, royal traditions and heroic stories. These Northern traditions were later incorporated into the Judahite Bible.

=== Jerusalem and Yehud/Judea of the Persian and Hellenistic periods ===
Finkelstein noted that in the Persian Period, Jerusalem was limited to the mound on the Temple Mount â and even there was sparsely settled â and that Yehud of that time was also thinly settled. As the description of the construction of the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah 3 must relate to the big city (extending beyond the old mound on the Temple Mount), it probably portrays the construction of the fortifications by the Hasmoneans.

Finkelstein further noted that many of the sites mentioned in the lists of returnees in Ezra and Nehemiah were not inhabited in the Persian Period and hence sees these lists as reflecting the demographic situation in days of the Hasmoneans. The same holds true, in his opinion, for the genealogies in 1 Chronicles. Finkelstein then looked into the accounts of Judahite monarchs in 2 Chronicles, which do not appear in Kings. He called attention to similarities between these texts and 1 Maccabees, and proposed to understand Chronicles as representing legitimacy needs of the Hasmoneans. This means that at least 2 Chronicles dates to the late 2nd century BCE, probably to the days of John Hyrcanus.

=== Scribal activity in Israel and Judah ===
Dating the appearance of inscriptions and the dissemination of writing in Israel and Judah has far-reaching implications in the study of the material culture of the Hebrew Kingdom and in biblical historiography. Finkelstein dealt with three aspects of this theme. (a) With Benjamin Sass, he suggested a new dating method for the alphabetic inscriptions which predate ca. 800 BCE. In the past, dating these inscriptions was based on assumptions which stemmed from interpretation of biblical texts, for instance the mention of scribes in the court of King David in the 10th century BCE. Yet, this is a circular argument, as biblical texts may portray realities of the time of their authors more than the situation in the past. Therefore, Finkelstein and Sass focused on the archaeological contexts of the inscriptions: the layer in which a given inscription was found, its relative chronology according to the ceramic assemblage, and absolute chronology according to 14c dating. They showed that Proto-Canaanite writing continued until the 9 th century BCE and that Hebrew writing did not appear before the very late 9 th century. (b) Following the same method â of scrutinizing the archaeological contexts of ancient inscriptions â Finkelstein dated the beginning of scribal activity in Judah to the late 8 th century BCE (about a century later than in Israel) and showed that writing disseminated there only in the 7 th century. (c) A research group which was headed by Finkelstein (with Eli Piasetzky and others)introduced computer science methods to the study of First Temple period Hebrew ostraca. The group concentrated on two avenues: multi-spectral imaging of inscriptions, and the number of &amp;quot;hands&amp;quot; in the Samaria and Arad ostraca; the latter enables better understanding of literacy and ability to compose biblical texts in Israel and Judah.

=== Archaeology of Jordan ===
On the archaeology of Jordan, Finkelstein suggested (with Oded Lipschits) a reconstruction of the Genesis of Moab and pointed to architecture characteristics of the Omride dynasty (Israel) in two sites in Moab which are mentioned in the late 9 th century BCE Mesha Inscription. In addition, he discussed the settlement history of the Transjordanian highlands, the copper industry in the eastern Arabah Valley, and sites in the Gilead, Ammon and Edom.

===Archaeology and history of arid zones ===
A central theme in Finkelstein&#x27;s work (with Ruth Shahak-Gross and others) is the archaeology and history of the arid zones, especially the Negev Highlands. Finkelstein concentrated on two waves of activity in this area. (a) The Early Bronze and the Intermediate Bronze. He showed that this wave of activity took place in the Early Bronze III and the first half of the Intermediate Bronze (ca. 2900-2200 BCE). The inhabitants of the sites engaged in animal husbandry but did not practice seasonal agriculture. The main impetus for this settlement wave was demand of copper in Old Kingdom of Egypt, which accelerated copper production in the Arabah Valley. Activity in the Negev Highlands sites ceased with the decline of the Old Kingdom. (b) An early phase of the Iron Age (ca. 950-850 BCE). The focus is on sites which were previously described as fortresses constructed by the United Monarchy of Ancient Israel. Finkelstein and his associates showed that they were built by the local inhabitants, who, in this case too, engaged in animal husbandry but not in seasonal agriculture. And yet again, the prosperity in the region was linked to copper production in the Arabah Vally. Another project focused on water cisterns and reservoirs in the region. It showed that the &quot;open&quot; (not rock-cut) water reservoirs,which had been dated solely to the Iron Age, were in fact the most common method of water-supply from the Early Bronze to medieval times.

=== Archaeological Science ===
Finkelstein played a pioneering role in the introduction of exact and life sciences methods and techniques to archaeology. He put special emphasis on advanced dating methods, first and foremost radiocarbon, but also archaeo-magnetism and OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence). He also engaged in studies of geo-archaeology (looking at sediments from ancient sites to identify subsistence patterns of their inhabitants), molecular residues in ceramic vessels (which points to early trade link with the Far East) and archaeo-metallurgy.

Three fields are of special interest: (a) Paleoclimate of the Levant according to pollen in sediments extracted from the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea (with DafnaLanggut). The study revealed patterns of climate change in the Bronze and Iron Ages; especially important is evidence for a dry period in the later part of the Late Bronze Age, that was a prime mover in the collapse of ancient civilizations during the &quot;Crisis Years&quot;; at the end of the Bronze Age. (b) A study of Ancient DNA of Bronze and Iron Age individuals (with researchers from the Hebrew University and Harvard), which pointed to migration of groups from the northeast of the ancient Near East to the Levant in the third and second millennia BCE. (c) Introduction of computer science methods to the study of ancient inscriptions and texts. One track â regarding Hebrew ostracaâwas described above; another track (with Eli Piasetzky, Nahum Dershovitz and Thomas Romer) deals with attempts to distinguish between genres in the biblical text.

The series is Produced by Djehuti Productions and the Albright Institute with a grant from the Shmunis Family Foundation.

== Awards and recognition ==
Finkelstein is the Laureate of the Dan David Prize in 2005. The select committee noted that he is &quot;widely regarded as a leading scholar in the archaeology of the Levant and as a foremost applicant of archaeological knowledge to reconstructing biblical Israelite history. He excels at creatively forging links between archaeology and the exact sciences and he has revolutionized many of these fields. â¦ Finkelstein has had an impact on radically revising the history of Israel in the 10th and 9th centuries BCE. He has transformed the study of history and archaeology in Israeli universities, moving from a &#x27;monumental&#x27; to a &#x27;systemic&#x27; study of the archaeological evidence.&quot;

In 2014, Finkelstein was awarded the Prix Delalande GuÃ©rineau: Institut de France, l&#x27;AcadÃ©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, for his book Le Royaume biblique oubliÃ© (The Forgotten Kingdom).

He is the recipient of the MacAllister Field Archaeology Award 2017 (The American Schools of Oriental Research).

His other awards include the French decoration of Chevalier de l&#x27;ordre des Arts et des Lettres, (2009) and the Doctorat honoris causa of the University of Lausanne (2010).

== Criticism ==
Finkelstein&#x27;s theories about Saul, David and Solomon have been criticized by fellow archaeologists. Amihai Mazar described Finkelstein&#x27;s Low Chronology proposal as &quot;premature and unacceptable&quot;. Amnon Ben-Tor accused him of employing a &quot;double standard&quot;, citing the biblical text where it suited him and deploring its use where it did not. Other criticisms came from William G. Dever (who dismissed the Low Chronology as &quot;idiosyncratic&quot;), Lawrence Stager, Doron Ben-Ami, Raz Kletter and Anabel Zarzeki-Peleg. David Ussishkin, despite agreeing with many of Finkelstein&#x27;s theories about the United Monarchy, has also shown doubts and reservations about Finkelstein&#x27;s Low Chronology.

Writing in the &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; and subsequently in the &quot;Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research&quot;, William G. Dever described &quot;The Bible Unearthed&quot; as a &quot;convoluted story&quot;, writing that &quot;This clever, trendy work may deceive lay readers&quot;. Ancient Near Eastern historian Kenneth Kitchen was also critical of the book, writing that &quot;[A] careful critical perusal of this workâwhich certainly has much to say about both archaeology and the biblical writingsâreveals that we are dealing very largely with a work of imaginative fiction, not a serious or reliable account of the subject&quot;, and &quot;Their treatment of the exodus is among the most factually ignorant and misleading that this writer has ever read.&quot; Another evangelical, Richard Hess, also being critical, wrote that &quot;The authors always present their interpretation of the archaeological data but do not mention or interact with contemporary alternative approaches. Thus the book is ideologically driven and controlled.&quot;

A 2004 debate between Finkelstein and William G. Dever, mediated by Hershel Shanks (editor of the &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot;), quickly degenerated into insults, with Dever calling Finkelstein &quot;idiosyncratic and doctrinaire&quot; and Finkelstein dismissing Dever as a &quot;jealous academic parasite&quot;. Dever later accused Finkelstein of supporting post-Zionism, to which Finkelstein replied by accusing Dever of being &quot;a biblical literalist disguised as a liberal&quot;. Shanks described the exchange between the two as &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

Following the publication of &quot;The Forgotten Kingdom&quot;, Dever once again harshly criticized Finkelstein: writing in the &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot;, he described Finkelstein as &quot;a magician and a showman&quot;. He stated that the book was full of &quot;numerous errors, misrepresentations, over-simplifications and contradictions&quot;. Another, more moderate, review was written on the same magazine by Aaron Burke: while Burke described Finkelstein&#x27;s book as &quot;ambitious&quot; and praised its literary style, he did not accept Finkelstein&#x27;s conclusions. He stated that the book engages in several speculations that cannot be proved by archeology, biblical and extra-biblical sources. He also criticized Finkelstein for persistently trying to downgrade the role of David in the development of ancient Israel.

<text>The Bergger company was begun over a century ago by French manufacturer Guilleminot. The company manufactures monochrome photographic film 35mm to 20&quot;x24&quot; as well as photographic paper and chemicals.

As of 2021, Bergger currently offer a single B&amp;W film manufactured on their behalf, Pancro 400 introduced in 2015 replacing BRF400Plus (in 120, 35 mm and sheet formats), and a low sensitivity (ISO 3) print film for darkroom use (in sheet format).

== History ==
Bergger was established in 1995 by Guy GÃ©rald, a chemical engineer and former employee of Guilleminot, and Daniel Boucher, an economics expert. The company specializes in producing black-and-white photosensitive materials in various formats and chemicals for photographic development.

In 2014, AurÃ©lien Le Duc became the majority shareholder and CEO. This led to the modernization of production lines that had remained largely unchanged since the 2000s. In 2015, Bergger introduced Pancro400 film for large format, which gained popularity among enthusiasts of black-and-white analog photography. By 2017, Pancro400 was also made available in 135 and 120 formats for traditional and medium-format cameras.

To further support analog photography, Bergger developed black-and-white film developers such as Berspeed and Superfine and revived traditional formulas like PMK, a pyrogallic acid-based developer dating back to the early days of photography. In 2019, Bergger launched the Bergger PrintFilm, a continuous-tone film on a PET base designed for creating inter-negatives or inter-positives for darkroom printing.

<doc id="712889" wikidata="Q507075" url="?curid=712889" title="Stanley Matthews (judge)">
<text>Thomas Stanley Matthews (July 21, 1824 â March 22, 1889), known as Stanley Matthews in adulthood, was an American attorney, soldier, judge and Republican senator from Ohio who became an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, serving from May 1881 to his death in 1889. A progressive justice, he was the author of the landmark rulings &quot;Yick Wo v. Hopkins&quot; and &quot;Ex parte Crow Dog&quot;

==Early life and education==
Matthews was born July 21, 1824, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was the oldest of 11 children born to Thomas J. Matthews and Isabella Brown Matthews (his second wife).

He graduated from Kenyon College in 1840. While there he met future president of the United States Rutherford B. Hayes and close friend John Celivergos Zachos. Matthews moved to his hometown Cincinnati with Zachos. Zachos and Matthews were roommates. In Cincinnati Matthews studied law under Salmon P. Chase but he moved to Columbia, Tennessee, where he practiced law and edited the local newspaper from 1842 and 1844. Matthews returned to Cincinnati in 1844, and was admitted to the bar the following year. In Cincinnati Matthews edited the antislavery newspaper &quot;Cincinnati Morning Herald&quot; and practiced law from 1853 to 1858.

In 1849, Stanley Matthews, John Celivergos Zachos, Ainsworth Rand Spofford and 9 others founded the Literary Club of Cincinnati. One year later Rutherford B. Hayes became a member. Other prominent members included future President William Howard Taft and notable club guests Ralph Waldo Emerson, Booker T. Washington, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde and Robert Frost.

==Early legal career==
 Matthews was selected to serve as the clerk of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1848, and afterward served as a county judge in Hamilton County, Ohio. He was then elected to the Ohio State Senate for the 1st district, where he served from 1856 to 1858. He was then appointed as United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, serving from 1858 to 1861.

==Military service==
At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Matthews resigned as U.S. Attorney and accepted a commission as lieutenant colonel with the 23rd Ohio Infantry Regiment of the Union Army. His superior officers included Colonel William S. Rosecrans and Major Rutherford B. Hayes, who would later become President of the United States. The regiment also included future President William McKinley, who served as a private and later rose to the rank of major.

Matthews served with the 23rd Ohio Infantry during the early campaigns in West Virginia and fought at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry on September 10, 1861. But Matthews did not enjoy the respect of his troops, and within a year he resigned from the 23rd Ohio Infantry.

After leaving the 23rd Ohio Infantry, Matthews was appointed colonel of the 51st Ohio Infantry Regiment in 1862. He commanded a brigade in the Army of the Ohio, which later became known as the Army of the Cumberland.

== State judge, lawyer and politician ==
In 1863, Matthews resigned from the Union Army and returned to Ohio, where he was elected judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati. Two years later, he returned to private practice. During the post-war reconstruction era, Matthews represented the railroad industry. His clients included Jay Gould.

He ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1876, but was defeated. Then, in early 1877, he represented Rutherford B. Hayes before the electoral commission that Congress created to resolve the disputed 1876 presidential election. That same year Matthews won a special election to the Senate to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of John Sherman. He did not seek reelection.

==Associate justice==
Matthews was initially nominated an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court on January 26, 1881, by President Hayes in the last weeks of Hayes&#x27;s presidency. The nomination ran into opposition in the U.S. Senate because of Matthews&#x27;s close ties to railroad interests and due to his close long-term friendship with Hayes. Consequently, the Judiciary Committee took no action on the nomination during the remainder of the 46th Congress.

On March 14, 1881, 10 days after taking office, President James A. Garfield re-nominated Matthews to the Court. Though a new nomination from a new president, earlier concerns about Matthews&#x27;s suitability for the Court persisted, and Garfield was widely criticized for re-submitting Matthews&#x27;s name. In spite of the opposition, and, although the Judiciary Committee made a recommendation to the Senate that it reject the nomination, on May 12, the Senate voted 24â23 to confirm Matthews. The vote was the closest for any successful Supreme Court nominee in U.S. Senate history; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.

Matthews&#x27;s tenure as a member of the Supreme Court began on May 17, 1881, when he took the judicial oath, and ended March 22, 1889, upon his death. He was regarded as one of the more progressive justices on the Court at the time.

==&quot;Yick Wo v. Hopkins&quot;==
In 1880, the city of San Francisco, California passed an ordinance that persons could not operate a laundry in a wooden building without a permit from the Board of Supervisors. The ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the city&#x27;s 320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings. Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by Chinese persons. Although most of the city&#x27;s wooden building laundry owners applied for a permit, none were granted to any Chinese owner, while virtually all non-Chinese applicants were granted a permit. Yick Wo (çå, Pinyin: YÃ¬ HÃ©, Americanization: Lee Yick), who had lived in California and had operated a laundry in the same wooden building for many years and held a valid license to operate his laundry issued by the Board of Fire-Wardens, continued to operate his laundry and was convicted and fined $10.00 for violating the ordinance. He sued for a writ of habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine.

The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as a blatant attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed.

==Personal life==
In 1843, Matthews married Mary Ann &quot;Minnie&quot; Black. They had 10 children, four of whom died during an outbreak of scarlet fever in 1859. Over a three-week period, the outbreak claimed the lives of their three eldest sons (nine-year-old Morrison, six-year-old Stanley, and four-year-old Thomas) as well as younger daughter Mary (age two-and-a-half). Oldest daughter Isabella (seven at the time) and baby William Mortimer survived the devastating outbreak, although Isabella would die in 1868 at the age of sixteen. Their four younger children (Grace, Eva, Jane, and another son named Stanley, later called Paul) were born after the scarlet fever outbreak.

&quot;Minnie&quot; died in Washington, D.C., on January 22, 1885, at age 63. Matthews married Mary K. Theaker, widow of Thomas Clarke Theaker, on June 23, 1886, in New York.

==Death and legacy==
Matthews&#x27;s health declined precipitously during 1888; he died in Washington, D.C., on March 22, 1889. He was survived by second wife Mary, as well as five of his children with Minnie: Mortimer, Grace, Eva, Jane, and Paul. He is interred at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Daughter Jane Matthews married her late father&#x27;s colleague on the Court, Associate Justice Horace Gray, on June 4, 1889. Daughter Eva Lee Matthews became a schoolteacher and monastic, founding the Community of the Transfiguration, which engaged in charity work in Ohio, Hawaii and in China, leading to her liturgical commemoration in the Episcopal Church. Son Paul Clement was bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey from 1915 to 1937. His son, Justice Matthews&#x27;s grandson, Thomas Stanley, was editor of &quot;Time&quot; magazine from 1949 to 1953.

A collection of Justice Matthews&#x27;s correspondence and other papers is located at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center library in Fremont, Ohio and open for research. Additional papers and collections are at: Cincinnati Historical Society, Cincinnati, Ohio; Library of Congress, Manuscript and Prints &amp; Photographs Divisions, Washington, D.C.; Ohio Historical Society, Columbus, Ohio; Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, New York; State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Archives Division, Madison, Wisconsin; and Mississippi State Department of Archives and History, Jackson, Mississippi.

<doc id="712892" wikidata="Q2086145" url="?curid=712892" title="ÇXam language">
<text>ÇXam (pronounced , in English as ) is an extinct language (or possibly cluster of languages) from South Africa formerly spoken by the ÇXam-ka ÇÊ¼Ä people. It is part of the ÇUi branch of the Tuu languages and closely related to the moribund NÇng language. Much of the scholarly work on ÇXam was performed by Wilhelm Bleek, a German linguist of the 19th century, who studied a variety of ÇXam spoken at Achterveld, and (with Lucy Lloyd) another spoken at Strandberg and Katkop while working with ÇKabbo, DiaÇkwÄin, ÇAÇkÃºá¹ta, ÇKweiten-ta-ÇKen, ÇHaá¹ÇkassÊ¼Å and other speakers. The surviving corpus of ÇXam comes from the stories told by and vocabulary recorded from these individuals in the Bleek and Lloyd Collection.

== Name ==
The pipe at the beginning of the name &quot;ÇXam&quot; represents a dental click, like the English interjection &quot;tsk, tsk!&quot; used to express pity or shame. The denotes a voiceless velar fricative click accompaniment.

Compared to other Khoisan languages, there is little variation in rendering the name, though it is sometimes seen with the simple orthographic variant ÇKham, as well as a different grammatical form, ÇKhuai.

==Doculects==
GÃ¼ldemann (2019) lists the following doculects as being well-enough attested to identify as ÇXam.

NÇusa is clearly ÇXam, but GÃ¼ldemann includes the three eastern ÇUi doculects (extending to Lesotho) under the term &quot;Wider ÇXam&quot;.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===
Compared to other Tuu languages like Taa, ÇXam has a more restricted inventory of consonants particularly the clicks, where there are only 8 series of click accompaniments, far fewer than East ÇXoon Taa&#x27;s 18. A preliminary consonant inventory of ÇXam, including egressive stops, fricatives, and affricates as well as ingressive clicks, is listed below.
=== Vowels ===
The five vowel sounds are noted as and are found with nasalization , pharyngealization , and glottalization .

=== Speech of mythological characters ===

Bleek notes that particular animal figures in ÇXam mythology have distinctive speech patterns. For example, Tortoise substitutes clicks with labial non-clicks, Mongoose replaces clicks with &quot;ts, tsy, ty, dy&quot; etc., and Jackal makes use of a &quot;strange&quot; labial click, &quot;which bears to the ordinary labial click Ê, a relation in sound similar to that which the palatal click Ç bears to the cerebral click Ç&quot;. The Moon, and perhaps Hare and Anteater, even use &quot;a most unpronounceable&quot; click in place of all clicks save the bilabial. Other changes noted include the Blue Crane&#x27;s speech, who ends the first syllable of almost every word with a /t/.

==== &quot;Fragment about the animal clicks and ways of speaking Bushman&quot; ====
* The jackal has a flat lip click. 
* A kind of side click in the middle of the mouth. (referring to the jackal?)
* The moon has the joint of the tongue being turned up and back to the roof of the mouth. This click has a kind of palatal click with it.
* The lion talks with a (?) side click and a (?) guttural with it. 
* The hyena has a flat click.

== Motto of South Africa ==

ÇXam is used for the South African motto on the coat of arms adopted on 27 April 2000:
The intended meaning is &quot;Diverse people unite&quot; or, on a collective scale, &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot;. The word-for-word translation is &quot;people who are different meet.&quot; However, it is not known if that phrase would have been idiomatic in ÇXam. Because it is extinct, ÇXam is not one of the twelve official languages of South Africa. Its last speakers died in the 1910s.

<text>&quot;The One with the Thumb&quot; is the third episode of &quot;Friends&quot;â³ first season. It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on October 6, 1994. This episode sees Chandler (Matthew Perry) pick up his old smoking addiction, a habit that the rest of the group finds hard to get him to break. Only Alan (Geoffrey Lower), the new boyfriend of Monica (Courteney Cox), can convince Chandler to drop the habit. The gang falls in love with Alan, but Monica does not see a future with him and the two break up, much to the disappointment of the friends. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) struggles to get rid of all the free money she is receiving, including $7,000 from a soda company when she finds a severed thumb in her drink. She uses the money to pay Chandler to stop smoking.

==Plot==
At the beginning of the episode, Chandler helps Joey rehearse for an audition. The rehearsal calls for Joey to smoke a cigarette, and as Joey is not a smoker and coughs after taking a drag, Chandler, who used to smoke, demonstrates the &quot;proper&quot; smoking technique to Joey. But as he begins to take a few drags, he becomes addicted and picks up his old habit again. Throughout the episode, the gang try to persuade him to quit, which irritates him greatly. He defends himself by saying it is just a flaw of his, and claims that they are being hypocritical, as they all have their own irritating habits (e.g. Monica&#x27;s snorting, Joey&#x27;s knuckle-cracking, Phoebe chewing her hair, and Ross&#x27;s over pronouncing of every word).

Phoebe discovers her bank has accidentally credited her with an extra $500. The gang persuades her to keep the money, but she decides to return it. However, instead of taking back the money, the bank gives her another $500 and a football phone. Not wanting to keep either the money or the phone, she gives both to Lizzy, a homeless woman. Lizzy buys a soda for Phoebe, who, upon opening the can, discovers a severed thumb floating in the soda. The soda company gives Phoebe $7,000.

Monica is afraid to introduce her new boyfriend Alan to the gang for fear of them ridiculing him and driving him away, as they have apparently done in the past with her other dates. Much to her surprise, the gang can find no fault with Alan, and enjoy his company very much. Alan even convinces Chandler to stop smoking in a very brief telephone conversation after repeated failed attempts by the gang. However, Monica does not quite share the gang&#x27;s enthusiasm for Alan, and decides to break up with him. Ironically, he tells her that he cannot stand the gang. Monica does not tell them about this in order to spare their feelings.

Chandler tries using patches to quit smoking, but gives up at the end of the episode, and announces he is getting cigarettes. Phoebe then offers him the $7,000 in return for not smoking again; Chandler gladly obliges.

==Reception==
In the original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 19.5 million viewers.

Sam Ashurst from Digital Spy ranked it #124 on their ranking of the 236 &quot;Friends&quot; episodes, and called it a &quot;strong, early episode&quot;.

&quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; also ranked &quot;The One with the Thumb&quot; #124 on their ranking of the 236 &quot;Friends&quot; episodes. They wrote that the show stealer was Chandler&#x27;s line &quot;Oh, Satanâs minions at work againâ¦&quot;.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;the Alan storyline isÂ pretty great, particularly because it extends that sense from the first episode that Monica&#x27;s friends are all very invested in her love life&quot;.

<text>Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is a protected area in the northern Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon in the United States. The 4,554-acre (1,843Â ha) park, including the marble cave, is 20 miles (32Â km) east of Cave Junction, on Oregon Route 46. The protected area, managed by the National Park Service (NPS), is in southwestern Josephine County, near the OregonâCalifornia border.

Elijah Davidson, a resident of nearby Williams, discovered the cave in 1874. Over the next two decades, private investors failed in efforts to run successful tourist ventures at the publicly owned site. After passage of the Antiquities Act by the United States Congress, in 1909 President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the United States Forest Service (USFS). The growing usage of the automobile, construction of paved highways, and promotion of tourism by boosters from Grants Pass led to large increases in cave visitation during the late 1920s and thereafter. Among the attractions at the remote monument is the Oregon Caves Chateau, a six-story hotel built in a rustic style in 1934. It is a National Historic Landmark and is part of the Oregon Caves Historic District within the monument. The NPS, which assumed control of the monument in 1933, offers tours of the cave from mid-April through early November. In 2014, the protected area was expanded by about and re-designated a National Monument and Preserve. At the same time, the segment of the creek that flows through the cave was renamed for the mythological Styx and added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

Oregon Caves is a solutional cave, with passages totaling about , formed in marble. The parent rock was originally limestone that metamorphosed to marble during the geologic processes that created the Klamath Mountains, including the Siskiyous. Although the limestone formed about 190Â million years ago, the cave itself is no older than a few million years. Valued as a tourist cave, the cavern also has scientific value; sections of the cave that are not on tour routes contain fossils of national importance.

Activities at the park include cave touring, hiking, photography, and wildlife viewing. One of the park trails leads through the forest to Big Tree, which at is the widest Douglas fir known in Oregon. Lodging and food are available at The Chateau and in Cave Junction. Camping is available in the preserve at the Cave Creek Campground, at a local USFS campground, and private sites in the area.

==Geography==

Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is in the Siskiyou Mountains, a coastal range that is part of the Klamath Mountains of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon. The monument consists of in the Rogue River â Siskiyou National Forest, about north of the OregonâCalifornia border in Josephine County. Elevations within the monument range from . Mount Elijah in the preserve rises to .

In December 2014 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, the U.S. Congress enlarged the protected area that includes the cave and changed its name from Oregon Caves National Monument to Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve. The preserve covers , and both it and the monument, which abuts the preserve, are administered by the same staff.

By highway, Oregon Caves is southwest of Grants Pass, south of Portland and north of San Francisco. The caves are east of the small city of Cave Junction via Oregon Route 46 off U.S. Route 199. The main cave has known passages totaling about in length. Eight separate smaller caves have also been discovered in the monument.

Runoff from the heavily wooded monument forms small headwater streams of the Illinois River, a major tributary of the Rogue River. One of five small springs in the monument becomes Upper Cave Creek, which flows on the surface before disappearing into its bed and entering the cave. Supplemented by water entering the cave from above, the stream emerges from the main entrance as Cave Creek. Within the cave, Cave Creek is known as the River Styx, named for the river Styx of Greek mythology connecting Earth to the Underworld. In late 2014, Congress added the River Styx to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, which added a level of protection aimed at keeping the stream free-flowing in perpetuity. It is the only subterranean river in the Wild Rivers system.

==History==
Archeologists believe the first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating suggests that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. Even so, no evidence has been found to suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thÂ century, used the cave.

Largely bypassed by the early non-native explorers, fur traders, and settlers because of its remote location, the region attracted newcomers in quantity when prospectors found gold near Jacksonville in the Rogue River valley in 1851. This led to the creation of Jackson County in 1852 and, after gold discoveries near Waldo in the Illinois River valley, the creation of Josephine County, named for the daughter of a gold miner. Even with an influx of miners and of settlers who farmed donation land claims, Josephine County&#x27;s population was only 1,204 in 1870.
Elijah Jones Davidson, who discovered the cave in 1874, had emigrated from Illinois to Oregon with his parents, who eventually settled along Williams Creek in Josephine County. Williams, as the community came to be called, is about northeast of the cave.

Only a few people visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, professor of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson&#x27;s brother, in 1884 he and a group of students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected by candlelight. Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.

In the early 1890s, the Oregon Caves Improvement Company, headed by Alfonso B. Smith of San Diego and two men from Kerby, Oregon, tried to raise capital for a larger tourist business at Oregon Caves. Smith made outlandish claims about the cave and its business potential, saying that it was long, that an ordinary horse and buggy could be driven through of it, that it had 600 separate chambers, and that the company planned to build something like a streetcar line from Williams to the cave. Smith succeeded in wooing &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, which twice sent reporters to the site. On the second visit, there was &quot;an orgy of destruction&quot; in which passages were widened, formations broken or deliberately removed, and directional arrows added to the cave walls. After Smith had spent all of the company&#x27;s money and borrowed more in its name, he disappeared in 1894, and the business collapsed.

Neither Burch nor Smith had owned the cave or the land around it, which belonged to the public. Beginning in the 1890s, the Federal government began regulating the use of public lands like these. In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt designated millions of acres of forest lands for protection, including what became Siskiyou National Forest, which surrounds the cave. The USFS was created in 1905 to manage these reserves. Three years later, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, which allowed the President to designate protected areas called National Monuments on public lands. In 1909, President William Howard Taft established Oregon Caves National Monument, to be managed by the USFS. A year later the USFS employed men to guard the cave and to serve as tour guides.

Isolated and difficult to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass â Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, the number of visitors to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.
The visitors&#x27; need for overnight lodging led to creation of public and private campsites and rustic cabins along highways near Cave Junction and the monument. In 1923, the USFS signed a contract with the Oregon Caves Company, based in Grants Pass, to run the cave tours and improve the park accommodations. Public-private partnerships between the USFS or NPS and concessionaires continued in various forms at Oregon Caves into the 21st century. The Chalet, a building with a kitchen, dining room, gift shop, ticket sales area, and a dormitory for women on the Oregon Caves Company staff, was completed later that year. Three years later, the company added seven two-bedroom cabins for tourists and a dormitory for male employees. In 1928, an Oregon Caves bill written by the USFS and introduced by Senator Charles McNary of Oregon won Congressional approval. It provided funds for electric lights, a power plant, a system of pipes and hoses to wash mud from the cave, and an artificial exit tunnel to eliminate the crowding that occurred when two groups on round-trip tours had to pass one another. The tunnel was completed in 1931.

Management of the monument was transferred from the Forest Service to the NPS in 1933, and a six-story hotel, the Oregon Caves Chateau, was completed at the site in 1934. Gust Lium, a builder from Grants Pass, oversaw construction of the Chateau and some of the park&#x27;s other buildings, which he designed in a rustic style. Mason Manufacturing of Los Angeles produced the Chateau&#x27;s furniture in a style called &quot;Monterey&quot;, valued in the 21stÂ century at up to $5,000 for a single chair. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) installed water and telephone lines, improved trails, and worked on landscaping at the park. The Chalet was rebuilt in 1942 to include a third story and a larger dormitory for women.

Although the Chateau suffered $100,000 in damage from a 1964 flood, it was repaired. By 1968, a total of oneÂ million people had visited the cave. In 1987, the Chateau was declared a National Historic Landmark, and in 1992, of the monument, including the Chateau and other rustic structures, were listed as the Oregon Caves Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2001, the NPS began running the cave tours formerly offered by private contractors, and two years later all the structures at the monument became public property managed by the NPS. The Illinois Valley Community Development Organization (IVCDO), a non-profit organization based in Cave Junction, runs the monument&#x27;s gift shop.

In 2014, the protected area was expanded by that was transferred from the Rogue River â Siskiyou National Forest to create the National Monument and Preserve. The preserve consists of forest, subalpine meadows, mountains, and creeks formerly managed by the USFS and now by the NPS. Named features within the addition include Mount Elijah (), Bigelow Lake, and a network of existing trails linked to the monument trails. Although hunting is allowed in the preserve but not in the monument, the new arrangement seeks to end cattle grazing in the Cave Creek â River Styx watershed.

==Geology and paleontology==
Most caves created from dissolved rocks are formed in limestone or dolomite, but Oregon Caves was formed in marble. Of the more than 3,900 cave systems managed by the NPS, only those in Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve, Kings Canyon National Park, and Great Basin National Park have marble caves.

The parent rock in which the cave developed was formed about 190Â million years ago as limestone that was part of a tectonic plate beneath the Pacific Ocean. Granitic plutons intruded this part of the ocean crust, the Applegate terrane, about 160Â million years ago. As the oceanic crust carrying the terrane subducted under the North American plate, the terrane accreted onto the North American Plate and the limestone was subjected to heat and pressure that metamorphosed it to marble. Further tectonic movements eventually lifted the marble to about above sea level. The marble block containing the cave is at least long, wide, and about high.

The cave&#x27;s creation took place long after the marble formed. As groundwater seeped into cracks in the marble, it eventually dissolved enough rock to expand some of the cracks to the size of tunnels. Generally, the age of a cave cannot be determined directly because the cave itself is an empty space, but scientists can sometimes determine the age of speleothems or sediments in a cave. An early 21st-century study of speleothem development in Oregon Caves focused on the past 380,000 years. Based on the available evidence, the cave is thought to be at least a million years old and &quot;probably not much older than a few million&quot; years.

Marble has a more coarse-grained texture than limestone, but both are made of calcite (). Caves often develop when slightly acidic groundwater dissolves calcite along natural fractures in the rock. A reversal of the dissolving process can create flowstone and dripstone such as stalactites, which hang from cave ceilings like icicles, and stalagmites, cone-shaped masses that form on cave floors, usually directly below stalactites. These structures form when acidic groundwater with a high concentration of dissolved calcite drips slowly from the ceiling of an air-filled cave, becomes less acidic, and leaves some of its calcite behind as a solid precipitate. Oregon Caves includes a variety of cave formations created through precipitation of calcite. Although many of the speleothems in the public sections of the cave have been broken, discolored by human skin oils, or otherwise damaged, the narrow twisting passages of the &quot;show cave&quot; have been largely preserved.

The cave is not pure marble. Streams have deposited silts and gravels from the surface. Dikes of diorite, an igneous rock that was part of a pluton, and shales and sandstones, sedimentary rocks interbedded with the marble, are part of the cave. 

The monument has more than 50 paleontological sites ranging in age from Late Pleistocene to Holocene. A fossil of a grizzly bear more than 50,000 years old and a jaguar fossil between 40,000 and 20,000 years old have been found in the cave. Other fossils include amphibians, and rare finds of the mountain beaver and the blue grouse. The monument&#x27;s
mammalian fossils, found in non-public sections of the cave, are of national significance.
==Climate==
The monument is in the mountains at elevations varying from above sea level. The park&#x27;s nearness to the ocean contributes to its relatively mild climate. Temperatures generally range between in winter and in summer. Inside the cave the temperature is always about . Annual precipitation, arriving mostly as wet snow, averages . Moderate winds are common.

==Flora and fauna==
Located within the KlamathâSiskiyou region, known for its high biodiversity, the monument supports 391 vascular plant species as well as many species of bryophyte, lichen, and macrofungi. Trees in the monument include Douglas fir, oak, white fir, and alder. Among the oldest trees is Big Tree, thought to be the widest Douglas fir in the state. It is in circumference near the base. Its age is estimated at 600 to 800 years, and it was described in the 1930s as in diameter. The monument contains no plants with special conservation status.

Species lists for the park include about 50 mammals, 86 birds, 11 reptiles and amphibians, 8 bats, more than 200 arthropods, 8 snails and slugs, 75 butterflies, more than 55 moths, and 8 aquatic macroinvertebrates. Of these species, 160 are found inside the cave. Outside the cave, the black-tailed deer, Steller&#x27;s jay, the common raven, and Townsend&#x27;s chipmunk are among animals often seen in the park. Less commonly sighted are the black bear, cougar, northern flying squirrel, and Pacific giant salamander. Springs and other wet places support flatworms, frogs, and snails.

Animal species in the park with special conservation status are the northern spotted owl, California mountain kingsnake, tailed frog, Del Norte salamander, northern goshawk, olive-sided flycatcher, little willow flycatcher, Siskiyou gazelle beetle, and Pacific fisher. Five at-risk bat species are found in the cave: Townsend&#x27;s big-eared bat, and the long-eared, fringed, long-legged, and Yuma myotis.

==Recreation and lodging==
Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is open year-round, although snow sometimes blocks the road to the park, and the visitor center is open when the cave is open for tours. Cave tours are usually offered from mid-April to early November, but the schedule depends in spring and fall on weather conditions. The Illinois Valley Visitor Center in Cave Junction, managed by the IVCDO under an NPS contract, also has information about the cave.

Cave-tour tickets are available online through the Recreation.gov website, and a limited number of tour tickets may sometimes be had first-come, first-served. Tours vary in length and duration. The basic ranger-guided &quot;discovery cave tour&quot;, 90 minutes long, requires negotiating more than 500 steep and uneven stairs and passageways with as little as between floor and ceiling. Not recommended by the NPS for anyone with heart, lung, or mobility problems, the tour involves a total climb of . Children under tall or who are unable to climb a set of test stairs on their own are not allowed on the full cave tour. The NPS offers a limited number of off-trail &quot;introduction to caving&quot; tours by reservation only.

Since the cave is only inside regardless of the outdoor temperature, the NPS recommends warm clothing for its tours. Good walking shoes are needed to negotiate slippery and uneven surfaces. Not allowed on the tours are flashlights, backpacks, large purses, tripods, or pets. To protect bats from white nose syndrome, visitors must not take any clothing or equipment into Oregon Caves that have previously entered any other cave or mine.

Lodging is available in the monument at the Chateau, which has 23 rooms to rent. Several hiking trails wind through the monument and adjacent forest lands. Big Tree Trail, long, gains in elevation between the visitor center and Big Tree. No Name Trail, long, begins behind the visitor center, follows Cave Creek, crosses it, and then climbs steeply to the west side of the monument. Two short side trails lead from the main trail to waterfalls along No Name Creek. Cliff Nature Trail, passing over marble outcrops and through fir forests, winds for about from near the cave entrance past the cave exit to Big Tree Trail. Old Growth Trail, long, links the Chateau and visitor center to the main parking lot. Other named trails entering the park include Cave Creek, Mt. Elijah, and Limestone. In 2012, the Oregon Caves Historic District was expanded to include several segments of the trail system.

Hotels, bed and breakfasts, motels, and resorts in the vicinity offer a variety of accommodations. Although no camping is allowed in the monument, the NPS maintains the Cave Creek Campground within the preserve. Additionally, the USFS maintains a campground nearby, and there are private campgrounds and recreational vehicle parks in the vicinity. The Chateau, generally open from early May to late October, has a restaurant, coffee shop, and delicatessen, and Cave Junction has several restaurants. The monument grounds include several picnic tables.

<text>Paeroa is a town in the Hauraki District of the Waikato Region in the North Island of New Zealand. Located at the base of the Coromandel Peninsula, it is close to the junction of the Waihou River and Ohinemuri River, and is approximately 20 kilometres (12.4 miles) south of the Firth of Thames.

New Zealanders know the town for its mineral springs, which in the past provided the water used in a local soft drink, &quot;Lemon &amp; Paeroa&quot;.

The town stands at the intersection of State Highways 2 and 26, and is the central service location for the Hauraki District. The town is about halfway between Auckland and Tauranga, and acts as the southern gateway to the Coromandel Peninsula, and as the western gateway to the Karangahake Gorge and the Bay of Plenty.

==History==
===Early history===
The west bank of the Ohinemuri River, north-west of Paeroa, was the site of Opukeko Pa, Te Raupa pÄ, Opita pÄ and Waiwhau pÄ, settled around the junction of the Waihou and Ohinemuri Rivers (originally due west of Paeroa). Te Raupa in particular was a heavily settled pÄ, likely settled between 1450 and 1500. The area was settled almost consistently until European contact, except for a brief period of river flooding. The area was originally settled by Ngamarama Ngati Tara, Ngati Koi [Bassett Kay, The Story of Ngati Tara Tokanui, Ngati Koi. Wai 714, 2001. pp 5.7.42] NgÄti Hako, and by NgÄti TamaterÄ from the 1600s.

Captain James Cook explored the Waihou River in 1779, taking a long-boat up as far as Netherton, just a couple of miles from where the town of Paeroa was built 100 years on. Samuel Marsden visited Raupa settlement in June 1820 for missionary work, and was impressed by the scale of wooden buildings he saw, and the number of people who settled in the area. During the Musket Wars, NgÄpuhi attacked the settlements in December 1821. Raupa was successfully defended, however the residents soon sought refuge in the Waikato. In 1830, NgÄti TamaterÄ returned to the area after the Battle of Taumatawiwi, however settled further south than the original settlements, and used Te Raupa as a burial site until the 1850s, when the iwi converted to Christianity.

The area was briefly explored in October 1826 by Captain James Herd, in command of the &quot;Lambton&quot; and the &quot;Isabella&quot; (or &quot;Rosanna&quot;). Herd was sent on an exploratory mission by the first organisation to be known as the New Zealand Company and claimed to have bought of land from local MÄori in Hokianga and Manukau.

By 1869, anticipating the rush to the Ohinemuri Goldfields, considerable numbers of miners camped at Cashell&#x27;s Landing &quot;Puke&quot;.

===Development of Paeroa township===
In 1870, Asher Cassrels, a Lithuanian, leased the block of land known as Paeroa from MÄori. This included Primrose Hill and most of what is now the town centre.

When James Mackay (surveyor) and Sir David McLean (Minister of Mines) completed negotiations six years later with the MÄori Chiefs, Tukukino and Taraia, the fields were declared open. Six hundred miners rushed to Karangahake, considered to be the El Dorado, on 3 March 1875. A canvas town of 1,600 people with about 20 stores and grog shops set the area going. The big gold reefs like Talisman and Crown were discovered but proved hard to work. Heavy machinery required for hard quartz mining had to be brought via the Waihou River and up to Paeroa. The river was the only highway and with two shipping companies in operation, Paeroa became a thriving transport and distribution centre.

When the Northern Steamship Company combined with its opposition, the wharves from near the Bank of New Zealand (Wharf Street) had to be shifted downstream in 1892, and eventually to just below Puke Bridge due to the silting from mining operations. A busy freight business developed with four ships regularly running from Auckland to Thames to Paeroa.

The Thames Branch railway line reached the town in 1881 at the Paeroa Railway Station, and gradually ships gave way to steam, which in turn gave way to road transport. Work on the PaeroaâPokeno Line commenced in the 1930s, but little was done and the proposal was abandoned.

A historic Paeroa building, in the town centre, is the former National Bank of New Zealand&#x27;s gold refinery, built in 1914 in Willoughby Street. The building is now a private home and business, hidden from street level view by a ponga fence. In 1911 the National Bank formed joint venture with the New Zealand Mining Trust and the bank purchased a section with a frontage by deep in Arthur Street (now Willoughby Street) for 200 pounds.

In the early 1900s, the Waihou River near Paeroa was straightened by making a canal, in order to protect farmland from flooding. By February, 1914, a Ferro-cement building , with an iron roof and a smokestack was completed. Inside was the main refining chamber, two assay offices, weighing room, accounting room, engine and dynamo rooms, two officers&#x27; bedrooms, sitting room and bathroom. Detached from the main building was a store room and coal bin.

===Modern history===

As late as 1928, the Waihou River was still navigable for larger ships all the way up to the town, and the Kopu Bridge was therefore constructed as a swing bridge.

When Brenan and Company, the largest horse and wagon operator, moved to trucking, they bought out the steamship company and named their trucks after the ships that plied the Ohinemuri River. Waimarie and Taniwha were always painted on the new International or Ford trucks that came into their fleet. When transport operator Sarjant&#x27;s amalgamated with Brenan, a large truck centre evolved in Paeroa.

As the passenger rail service dwindled, Paeroa eventually lost its railway, so much of the town had its beginnings in supply and transport to the Hauraki and District. The swings of time have enabled the town to boom and revert a number of times.

In 1981 there was a large flood in the Waikato due to heavy rain. Over 2,250 people were evacuated in Thames, Paeroa, and Waihi.

==Culture==
=== Lemon &amp; Paeroa ===

Paeroa is best known for the soft drink Lemon &amp; Paeroa (L&amp;P) that used to be produced in the town. The soft drink was made with lemon and carbonated mineral water from Paeroa. Today L&amp;P is owned by Coca-Cola and produced on the same production line as other Coca-Cola products sold in New Zealand.
A large L&amp;P bottle stands on the main road as a landmark in the town of Paeroa. In 1994 L&amp;P ran a series of advertisements based around Paeroa, the advert had locals standing in front of various parts of the town pointing out what the town isn&#x27;t famous for. In one advertisement, a local stands in front a 1930s bungalow making the comment, &quot;It&#x27;s not famous for its Hollywood mansions&quot;. Landmarks and features in the town included the towns Harbour Bridge (a small single lane bridge), bright lights (a flashing chemist sign), luxury hotels (a local motel), trendy shops (an Op Shop) and Opera House (the back of the local town hall).

At the end of each advert a group of people would end by saying &quot;But it is famous&quot; pointing to the landmark L&amp;P bottle in the background. The advert would end with the tag line L&amp;P World Famous in New Zealand. There were 3 separate advertisements all using the song &quot;Counting the Beat&quot; by The Swingers.

===Events===

Paeroa is known as the Events Capital of the Coromandel, as well as having a national reputation for horse racing. February is a busy event month in Paeroa and the motorcycle race âBattle of the Streetsâ and âPipe Band Tattooâ events both attract participants and crowds from all over New Zealand and overseas.

The horse track was closed in 2014 due to financial issues with the managers of the track.

===Marae===

There are a number of Marae associated with Paeroa: Ngahutoitoi the Marae of Ngati Tara Tokanui-Ngamarama-Ngati Koi is South of the township. Two &quot;marae&quot; (tribal meeting grounds) of the NgÄti TamaterÄ are located in Paeroa: Taharua and Te Pai o Hauraki. Each has a &quot;wharenui&quot; meeting house of the same name.

===Sports===
The Thames Valley Rugby Union are based in the Paeroa, and compete in the Heartland Championship. Several amateur sports clubs are also based in the town. These include clubs for rugby, soccer, netball, cricket, tennis, bowls and golf.

<doc id="712909" wikidata="Q6742173" url="?curid=712909" title="Minister Faust">
<text>Malcolm Azania (born 1969), is a Kenyan-Canadian novelist, teacher, writer, and journalist. He is primarily known by his pen name, Minister Faust. In addition to writing science fiction, he is a playwright, journalist, teacher, and poet. He has also written video games. He was writer in residence at the University of Alberta, 2014-2015.

== Personal life ==
Born in Edmonton, Alberta, Malcolm Azania is the son of a Kenyan and a Canadian. He attended local schools and started writing from an early age, showing an interest in science fiction.

== Career ==
Azania&#x27;s first published work was his science fiction play, &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1986), for Montreal&#x27;s Creations Etc.

He is the current writer in residence at the University of Alberta. Writing in the science fiction and fantasy genres, he refers to his subgenre of writing as imhotep-hop. Imhotep-hop is an Africentric subgenre that draws inspiration from numerous ancient African civilizations and focuses on a future in which people struggle for justice.

Most of his works deal with political themes in some way, with the most notable works being the ongoing War &amp; Mir series.

=== Novels ===
==== &quot;The Coyote Kings&quot; ====
Azania&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;The Coyote Kings, Book One: Space Age Bachelor Pad&quot; (2004), was a finalist for the Philip K. Dick award, The Locus Best First Novel Award, and The Compton-Cook Award. The novel follows Sherem, an Ethiopian savant, and Hamza and Yehat through a story filled with action, pop culture and Africentric themes.

==== &quot;From the Notebooks of Dr. Brain&quot; ====
His second book, &quot;From the Notebooks of Dr. Brain&quot; (2007), was the winner of the Carl Brandon Society Kindred Award and the runner-up for the Philip K. Dick Prize. The story explores around six fictional super heroes in therapy and their revelations of the difficulties of being a celebrity.

==== &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot; ====
&quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot; (2011) follows the paths of two Sudanese boys as they attempt to change the world.

 &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot; is a Science Fiction Afrofuturist novel written under Malcom Azaniaâs pen name: Minister Faust. This novel is broken up into four sections each containing its own collection of chapters. The chapters in this novel switch back and forth from âThe Book of Thenâ and âThe Book of Now.â There is a third book called âThe Book of the Golden Falcon,â which can be found at the end of the novel before the Falconic Glossary and map of Ancient and Modern Kush. In âThe Book of Then,â &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot;âs setting is in the Savage Lands and the Blacklands of Africa. âThe Book of Nowâ takes place in Canada. &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot; was published in July 2011. Each one of the three books contains 10 chapters. 

 In the Authorâs Note, Minister Faust gives some suggestions on how to read his work. Minister Faust writes âcertainly, feel free to read the novel in the path that itâs printedâ¦ But you could also read all the âThenââs as a group, followed by âNowââs together, ending with âThe Book of the Golden Falconââ¦ or read the first chapters of every âFalcon,â âThen,â and âNow,â all the way through to each oneâs tenth chapter.â

 Minister Faust incorporates the ancient practice of Alchemy, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, numerology, and mythology within &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot;. Minister Faust puts a heavy emphasis on past lives and reincarnation as well as following those karmic patterns within each spirit. In his own words, Minister Faust, in a YouTube interview, introduces the Alchemical system as âa mystical system; a knowledge system.â Faust fused âAncient Egyptian historyâ and âmodern African realitiesâ together to create &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot;, an Africentric novel. 

 The setting for &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot; âThe Book of Nowâ is in Kush located in E-Town (Edmonton), Canada. In his YouTube book trailer, Minister Faust describes E-Town as a âSomali, Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Sudanese district.â âThe Book of Thenâ takes place in Africa, in the Savage lands and the Blacklands over seven thoughts and years before âThe Book of Nowâ (modern day time) takes place. 
 For the 2017 published version of &quot;The Alchemists of Kush&quot;, the summary on the back of the novel reads âtwo Sudanese âLost Boys.â Both fathers murdered during civil war. Both mothers forced into exile through lands where the only law was violence. To survive, they became ruthless loners and child soldiers. Before finding mystic mentors who transformed them to achieve their destinies. Separated by seven thousand years, and connected by immortal truthâ¦ One, known to the streets as Supreme Raptor: the other, known to the Greeks as Horus, son of Osiris. Both born in fire. Both baptized with blood. Both brutalized by the wicked. Both sworn to transform the world and themselves by the powerâ¦ of Alchemy.â 

 ISBN No. 978-1737227748

In the game, the player controls a yeti who must take Santa&#x27;s place for one year, and deliver presents to everyone while evading the police.

<doc id="712911" wikidata="Q2281865" url="?curid=712911" title="Malcolm Winters">
<text>Malcolm Winters is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Originally and most recently portrayed by Shemar Moore, Darius McCrary took over between December 29, 2009, and October 17, 2011. Moore reprised the role for guest appearances in September 2014, April 2019 and May 2023.

Malcolm is the half-brother of longtime character, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John). His history includes getting Neil&#x27;s wife, Drucilla Winters, pregnant, as well as other conflicts with his brother, his history as a photographer, and marriages to Olivia Winters and Sofia Dupre. In March 2019, it was announced that Moore would reprise the role of Malcolm Winters for a two-episode stint, following St. John&#x27;s passing the month before.

==Casting==
The role was originated by Shemar Moore on May 5, 1994, who received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal in 2000, with nominations for Outstanding Younger Actor in 1996 and 1997. After much speculation that Moore would exit the soap opera in 2000, he confirmed that he would depart at the end of his contract in the spring of 2001. However, in February 2001, Moore announced that he had extended his contract through the end of that year. In December, he announced he was leaving &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and last aired on February 14, 2002. In September 2004, after a two-year absence, Moore was announced to reprise the role. Of Moore&#x27;s return, former co-head writer John F. Smith stated: &quot;We are thrilled to have Shemar back with us. His story will be something very unexpected, off the page, and exciting. The man is going to have impact.&quot; Moore made his return on November 1, 2004. However, within weeks, Moore&#x27;s publicist revealed that his return would be short-lived, as he had only signed a six-month contract. The publicist stated: &quot;He&#x27;s auditioning now [for other projects] and he has two or three films coming out next year. You know how this industry is. At least [The Young and the Restless will] have him for six months.&quot; Moore made his final appearance as the character on September 1, 2005.

In September 2009, it was announced that the soap opera had put out a casting call for the role of Malcolm. In November, Darius McCrary was announced to be joining the cast, in his first daytime television role, with his first appearance on December 29, 2009. In September 2011, it was announced that McCrary had been let go from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. He made his final appearance on October 17, 2011. On July 23, 2014, CBS Daytime announced that Moore would reprise the role of Malcolm for a two-episode guest stint starting on September 10, 2014. In March 2019, it was announced that Moore would return for another two-episode guest stint, following the death of Kristoff St. John.

==Storylines==
===1994â2002, 2004â05===
Malcolm first arrives in Genoa City in 1994, determined to rebuild his relationship with his estranged half-brother, Neil Winters. Neil, at first, wants nothing to do with his rebellious younger half-brother, but eventually decides to give him a second chance. With the help of Blade Bladeson, Malcolm became Genoa City&#x27;s most prominent photographer.

He develops a friendship with Neil&#x27;s wife Drucilla Barber, and is instantly smitten with her, but nothing becomes of it. However, Malcolm later discovers Drucilla after she has taken a good dose of cold medication, and thus mistakes Malcolm for Neil. After Drucilla calls out for Neil, making Malcolm realize her advances were not intended for him, Malcolm chooses to rape her. The following morning, Malcolm realizes what a mistake he has made and confides his crime to Dru&#x27;s sister, Olivia.

Nine months later, Drucilla gives birth to a daughter, Lily Winters. Having convinced herself that Neil is Lily&#x27;s father, Dru forgives Malcolm and Olivia soon fixes him up with her hospital colleague, Keesha Monroe. They fall in love and marry, just before Keesha dies of AIDS.

Malcolm then develops a relationship with recently widowed Olivia and grows very attached to her son Nathan Hastings, Jr. Malcolm and Olivia marry in 1997. One year later, Malcolm&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Callie Rogers arrives in town and Olivia becomes jealous that Malcolm is spending so much time with her. Olivia&#x27;s insecurity ultimately destroys her marriage to Malcolm and he rebounds back to Callie. The two become engaged but Callie soon breaks it off and leaves town. In the meantime, Malcolm continues his close relationship with his former stepson Nate, who views Malcolm as his father.

Malcolm and Neil soon find themselves fighting over a woman, attorney Alex Perez. Malcolm and Alex fall in love and become engaged, though she is also developing feelings for Neil. While the three of them are on business in Kenya, Malcolm mistakenly overhears Alex confess her feelings to Neil and leaves. While driving over a bridge, on the way to a photo shoot, the bridge collapses and Malcolm is presumed dead.

Malcolm returns to town two years later resenting Neil, believing he purposely did not do enough to rescue him in Kenya, so that he could have Alex for himself. Eventually the two bury the hatchet. While in town, Malcolm briefly has a fling with Adrienne Markham, Damon Porter&#x27;s ex-wife.

Malcolm then demands that Dru take a paternity test to determine once and for all if he is Lily&#x27;s biological father. When Malcolm is proven to be Lily&#x27;s father, he and Dru decide to keep it a secret and he leaves town. While Malcolm is gone, Lily and Neil discover the truth about her paternity, but are unable to contact him.

===2009â11===
Four years later, Malcolm returned to Genoa City while secretly working undercover as a corporate spy for Tucker McCall. He learns that Lily had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and attempted to support her while clashing with Neil. However, the two eventually put aside their differences and reconnected as brothers. Malcolm took a job as a photographer at &quot;Restless Style&quot; magazine and hired his adopted nephew, Devon Hamilton, as his assistant. Months after Malcolm mentioned he was engaged, his fiancÃ©e, Sofia Dupre, arrived in town. She worked for Tucker and had a business clash with Neil, and they ended up having a one-night stand and not telling Malcolm to act like it never happened. Malcolm and Sofia were married soon after.

Sofia is later found out to be pregnant, though the paternity of the baby was left undetermined. While pregnant, Sofia was forced to tell Malcolm the truth about her night with Neil, and that she wasn&#x27;t sure of the paternity of the baby. Sofia gave birth to a boy named Moses Winters, after her father. Afterward, a paternity test showed that Neil is Moses&#x27;s father. Devastated, Malcolm had to make a decision about his future with Moses, and visited Sofia in the hospital and asked her to sign divorce papers and tells her that he will be moving away, even though Sofia wanted to work out their marriage. Malcolm said goodbye to Genoa City and headed for the airport.

===2014===
In September 2014, Malcolm returned to Genoa City, planning to overcome his differences with Neil, and help him cope with his sudden blindness. The two re-establish their relationship as brothers and Malcolm heads off to his next photo shoot.

===2019===
After Neil&#x27;s sudden death, Malcolm returns to Genoa City to be with the family. At Neil&#x27;s funeral, Malcolm gives a tearful and emotional eulogy stating that while his relationship with his brother wasn&#x27;t always perfect, he always had an unconditional love and admiration for him. He thanks Neil for all he&#x27;s done for him and given him. After comforting everyone at the house, Malcolm heads back on the road, promising to stay in touch.

===2023===
Malcolm surprises the family with a brief visit to a gala in honor of Neil. They reflect and catch up before Malcolm heads back on the road.

==Reception==
Malcolm quickly won popularity with both viewers and critics as did Moore himself. He was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series three times in 1996, 1997, and 2000, winning in the latter year.

Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed the recasting of Malcolm on his list of the worst soap opera recasts of all time, saying &quot;Don&#x27;t blame Darius McCrary for this recast&#x27;s failure â the guy&#x27;s a fine actor who brought a cool edge to the role of Malcolm. Unfortunately, predecessor Shemar Moore had been soÂ &quot;extraordinarily&quot;Â popular in the part that no way, no how were viewers going to accept anybody else playing it. In fact, after McCrary&#x27;s two-year stint ended, Moore came back for not one but two visits.&quot; In 2022, Mason also placed Malcolm 14th on his list of the best 25 characters from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

<doc id="712912" wikidata="Q20785929" url="?curid=712912" title="The One with George Stephanopoulos">
<text>&quot;The One with George Stephanopoulos&quot; is the fourth episode of the first season of the NBC television series &quot;Friends&quot;. The fourth episode of the show overall, it was first broadcast on October 13, 1994. The episode was directed by James Burrows and written by Alexa Junge. This episode is the first of many that splits the gang into two separate stories based on gender. The guys go to a hockey game, where Ross (David Schwimmer) gets hit in the face with a hockey puck. The rest of the evening is spent in the ER, where a surly receptionist gets her nose broken when the puck goes flying. Meanwhile, the girls, sparked by celebrations over Rachel&#x27;s first paycheck, spy on George Stephanopoulos, then President Clinton&#x27;s top aide, which culminates in them seeing Stephanopoulos nude.

== Plot ==
When Phoebe cannot get any sleep because her grandmother is having loud sex with her boyfriend, Monica invites her to sleep over at her apartment with her and Rachel.

Chandler and Joey go to the coffee house to invite Ross to a hockey game as a &quot;late birthday present&quot;. Ross is reluctant after becoming depressed about the day being the anniversary of him and ex-wife Carol sleeping together for the first time. He eventually accepts after Joey is able to convince him after promising him a foam finger.

At the hockey game, Ross continues to reminisce on Carol, which makes him depressed once again, and annoys Chandler and Joey. He becomes happy again when the game starts but is soon hit in the face with the hockey puck and are forced to head to the hospital where they deal with a snippy receptionist, Nurse Sizemore (Mary Pat Gleason). While waiting around, Ross admits to Chandler and Joey that the memory is important to him as it was the day he lost his virginity. After Ross is fit in a nose cast, he encounters a bratty boy (Benjamin Caya) who &quot;found&quot; the hockey puck that hit Ross and claims it as his own. Ross asks for it back and the kid refuses. After a short brawl over the puck, it flies out of the boy&#x27;s grasp and it hits the receptionist in the face, which Ross admits was fun.

Meanwhile, Rachel receives her first paycheck. She is very excited at first only to discover she will not have much after taxes. She also gets reunited with her old friends, Leslie (Leesa Bryte), Kiki (Michele Maika), and Joanne (Marianne Hagan). While they boast about their career and family achievements, she feels increasingly depressed because of her low income. Back at the apartment, while the girls are getting ready for their slumber party, Rachel gets a call from her credit card company and complains about her low income. Monica and Phoebe try to cheer her up with no effect as it actually makes them depressed too.

A pizza delivery guy (Sean Whalen) arrives, although he brings them the wrong pizza; the one he brought was meant for &quot;G. Stephanopoulos&quot;, who is staying at one of the apartments across the street. The girls pay for the pizza and head to the balcony with binoculars to spy on George, who is on a date. As they spy on him and his date, they get drunk and start telling each other secrets. This ends up in a brawl between Monica and Rachel, with Phoebe stopping them once she spots George, and the three women are amazed when they see him nude after he takes his towel off.

During the credits, Joey and the girls are playing Twister. Rachel gets another call from her credit card company; Chandler takes her place in the game. When asked why she has not been using her card, she says she is doing fine, confident in her independence.

==Reception==
Joe Reid and Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club both commented on the episode, Saraiya said; &quot;&quot;The One With George Stephanopoulos&quot; uses a tried-and-true sitcom conventionâit splits the cast on gender lines and sends them off to different adventures, allowing them to &quot;bro out&quot; or have &quot;girl talk&quot; as need be. Chandler, Joey, and Ross have a hockey adventure, which is punctuated by Ross&#x27; reminisces of his &quot;first time&quot; with Carol and ends up, obviously, in the emergency room; meanwhile, the girls, led by Rachel, worry about their life plans and also get drunk and also spy on George Stephanopoulos, who is soooo dreamy. Of the two stories, the latter has real staying powerâthe conversation feels like it could have been written today, or to be more exact, it feels like it was transcribed verbatim from the conversation that occurred on my couch last night.&quot; Reid said; &quot;In &quot;The One With George Stephanopoulos,&quot; Rachel is very much questioning her decision, and after spending an afternoon with her squealing Fifth Avenue friends, she&#x27;s really having second thoughts. Of course, there isn&#x27;t an existential crisis on Earth that couldn&#x27;t have been solved by the chance to gawk at George Stephanopoulos from across an alleyway. At least in 1994. I was genuinely shocked to remember that there was a time that Stephanopoulos was a sex symbol. What desperate, pre-Clooney times those were!&quot;.

<doc id="712915" wikidata="Q2246528" url="?curid=712915" title="Drury, New Zealand">
<text>Drury is a rural town near Auckland, in northern New Zealand. Located 36 kilometres to the south of Auckland CBD, under authority of the Auckland Council. Drury lies at the southern border of the Auckland metropolitan area, 12 kilometres to the northeast of Pukekohe, close to the Papakura Channel, an arm of the Manukau Harbour.

==Name==
Drury is named after Commander Byron Drury, captain of HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;, who surveyed the Manukau Harbour in 1853.

==History==

Coal mining was a significant early industry established in Drury during the 1850s, and saw the formation of the Waihoihoi Mining and Coal Company in 1859. Continued success with coal mining led to the opening of one of New Zealand&#x27;s earliest tramways by the company in 1862, consisting of 4ft 8in gauge track with a length of 5.2km, whereby coal was transported to Slippery Creek for shipment to Onehunga. Another early industry seen in Drury was that of an extensive brick and pottery works, linked to a nearby quarry by a tram line at the foot of the Drury Hills. The brick and pottery industry in Drury appears to have operated until at least 1928.

Drury was a significant staging area for British soldiers during the New Zealand Wars, who established a camp in the village under the command of General Duncan Cameron. These soldiers also helped to construct an extension to the Great South Road south to the Mangatawhiri Stream.

During the major reform of local government in 1989, Drury was included in the Auckland Region and made up the southern edge of the Papakura District, along with a certain extent of the eastern surrounding rural areas, previously known as Franklin County. Drury was until recently a relatively small semi-rural area nestling at the foot of the low-lying Bombay Hills. Urban spread of Auckland has rendered it an extreme southern suburb, close to the junction between State Highways 1 and 22, both of which head south towards the Waikato region.

After a review of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, the entire Auckland Region was amalgamated into a single city authority, the Auckland Council, in 2010. The Papakura District and Franklin District, and all other territorial authorities in the region were abolished and incorporated into the new council. The town of Drury was included in the Franklin ward, one of the thirteen wards of the council.

==Future growth==
Auckland&#x27;s largest business park, expected to employ 6900 people, is currently under development in the south of Drury. An estimated 2500 homes are also set to be built in the west of Drury, with development already well underway.

In 2020 the size of the developments and of the Auckland Council contribution was under consideration.

<text>&quot;The One with the Blackout&quot; is the seventh episode of the first season of the NBC television series &quot;Friends&quot;. The seventh episode of the show overall, it was first broadcast on November 3, 1994.

In the episode, there&#x27;s a blackout in the city, and Chandler gets stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre and Ross attempts to tell Rachel his feelings for her.

This episode coined the term &quot;friend zone&quot;.

==Plot==
The episode begins with Monica, Rachel, Ross, and Joey watching Phoebe begin an acoustic set at Central Perk, only to get interrupted by a sudden blackout in New York City.

Chandler gets trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre, a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model, and nervously tries to impress her in various ways. When she offers him some chewing gum, he reluctantly accepts and tries to blow a bubble with the gum only to spit it out accidentally. He then tries to chew the gum again, only to realize it is someone else&#x27;s gum and then proceeds to choke on it from the shock. Jill gives him the Heimlich maneuver and saves his life, and the two spend the rest of the night hanging out and playing games together. When the lights come back on, Jill kisses Chandler on the cheek. A desperate Chandler then turns to the security camera in the corner and asks for a copy of the tape.

Back at Monica&#x27;s apartment, the rest of the friends have a discussion on the weirdest place they have ever had sex and Rachel confesses that hers was &quot;the foot of the bed&quot;. This leads to a conversation between her and Ross about how she wishes she had more excitement in her love life. Ross transposes his infatuation for her by predicting that her wish will come true in the future. Joey convinces Ross that he needs to tell Rachel how he feels about her before Ross enters the &quot;friend zone&quot;.

Ross works up the courage to speak to Rachel but before he can confess his feelings, a stray cat attacks him. Rachel and Phoebe search for the owner in the building. The owner turns out to be new Italian neighbor Paolo, whose sudden appearance is disconcerting to Ross, who even tries to warn him off of Rachel despite him not understanding English. The last candle in the apartment goes out and everyone tries to make the scariest noise possible. During Ross&#x27;s turn, the lights come back on and everyone sees Rachel and Paolo kissing.

==Reception==
&quot;Purple Clover&quot; called the episode one of the 20 funniest episodes of &quot;Friends&quot;.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the episode &quot;a little bit bland, a little too distressingly clichÃ©&quot;.

The British website Digital Spy put the episode on their list of &quot;&quot;Friends&quot;: The 15 Best Episodes of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the episode as one of the top 25 episodes of &quot;Friends&quot;.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked the episode as of the show&#x27;s top 25, calling it &quot;perfection&quot;.

<doc id="712932" wikidata="Q7358361" url="?curid=712932" title="Roger Howarth">
<text>Roger Howarth (born September 13, 1968) is an American actor. He played character Todd Manning on the daytime drama &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (&quot;OLTL&quot;); the character earned Howarth a Daytime Emmy Award in 1994, and is cited as an icon in the soap opera genre. He left the series in 2003 and joined soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, where he played the character of Paul Ryan until the series&#x27; final episode in 2010. Howarth returned to &quot;OLTL&quot; in May 2011, continuing the role on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in March 2012. Due to a lawsuit from Prospect Park, Howarth, along with Kristen Alderson and Michael Easton, were forced to exit their roles in March 2013, only to return as new characters in May of the same year. He returned as Franco on &quot;General Hospital,&quot; the character formerly created and portrayed by James Franco. When the character was written off in March 2021, Howarth returned two months later as a new character, Austin Gatlin-Holt. In addition to his soap opera work, Howarth has guest starred in television shows such as &quot;Prey, The Flash&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;.

==Early life==
Howarth was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. His father was involved in theater and wrote plays. Exposed to the arts at an early age, Howarth performed in the play &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; at the age of seven. He was active in his high school drama department and performed in numerous plays at school. He played soccer from the time he was a small child up until 19 years of age. He took the opportunity to play in other countries with the Puma Shoes U.S. National Soccer Team. In an interview, when asked if he was a professional soccer player, Howarth answered, &quot;No! Heavens no.&quot; He reiterated how he had played soccer as a child up to his late teenage years and said he was on a team that played in Europe, Brazil, and other countries, but that it was an amateur team; he &quot;never got paid&quot; to play, Howarth said.

Howarth initially resisted acting as a profession and studied political science at George Washington University. However, after one semester, he dropped out of college to join an intense acting program at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre Center in Connecticut.

==Career==
Howarth was discovered during a nationwide talent search and was cast in the role of Kent Winslow on the ABC daytime drama &quot;Loving&quot;. The role was short-lived. It was shortly after this that he was cast on the ABC daytime drama &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as rapist Todd Manning in what was supposed to be a day-player role, but became one of the genre&#x27;s most successful and enduring characters. The character has also been termed an icon by the press. Howarth portrayed Todd on-and-off since 1992. He was strongly praised for his work on the series, and won a Daytime Emmy Award in 1994 for the role. Subsequent attempts to redeem Todd, however, unnerved Howarth. After a female fan shouted &quot;Rape me, Todd!&quot; at a public appearance, his ambivalence about the role deepened. After attempts were made to romantically pair Todd with his victim, Marty Saybrooke, Howarth quit the show in 1995. He subsequently returned, but Todd was portrayed even more as a villain than a hero. His character&#x27;s pairing with Kassie DePaiva&#x27;s Blair Cramer won over fans and the two later became a supercouple. While with the series, Howarth found time to extend his career to primetime, and was cast as the murderous Randall Lynch for 4 episodes of the sci-fi series &quot;Prey&quot;.

In 1998, Howarth departed &quot;One Life to Live&quot; for a second time, looking to pursue other acting projects both on Broadway and in Hollywood. He made his first Broadway debut in &quot;The White Rose&quot;, but also did some theater work in &quot;Henry IV, Passions&quot;, &quot;You Touched Me&quot;, &quot;Mother Courage&quot;, and &quot;Orestes&quot;. A prominent stage appearance for Howarth was in James Goldman&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;The Lion In Winter&quot;. The play officially opened on Broadway on March 11, 1999, and ended with &quot;its final curtain&quot; on May 30, 1999. During the play&#x27;s run, Howarth appeared opposite Stockard Channing and Laurence Fishburne.

In 2000, Howarth returned to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He portrayed Professor Greg Hetson on the series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; in 2003 during a brief break from the role of Todd. Later that year, he decided it was time for him to move on from the role of Todd, and he signed on with CBS daytime drama &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, taking over the role of Paul Ryan in July 2003.

In August 2010, it was reported that Howarth would be returning to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; sometime in January 2011, though other sources disputed this. On April 4, 2011, it was confirmed that Howarth would be returning to the series. Before reclaiming his previous role, it was initially unknown if he would be returning as Todd or someone connecting him to the character. &quot;I am looking forward to returning to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;,&quot; stated Howarth. &quot;We are going to have a lot of fun telling this story, and I am excited to see how it will unfold.&quot; Howarth made his onscreen return on May 13, 2011.

Howarth, Michael Easton and Kristen Alderson appeared on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 2012 to 2013. Their characters of Todd Manning, John McBain and Starr Manning would return to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and likely be recast with new actors with the current actors receiving new characters once they return to &quot;General Hospital.&quot; Prospect Park owned the rights to all &quot;One Life to Live&quot; characters; &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that because ABC does not want to risk any further legal disputes with Prospect Park concerning the characters, the only way to avoid such disputes may be to have the former &quot;One Life to Live&quot; actors portray &quot;characters that in no way resemble the current ones&quot; in order to stay on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. ABC announced that the actors would be returning to &quot;General Hospital&quot; on May 13, 2013, but without naming the characters they would portray. Howarth also continued to portray Todd Manning on Prospect Park&#x27;s online version of &quot;One Life to Live.&quot;

On May 29, 2013, Howarth&#x27;s new character on &quot;General Hospital&quot; was revealed; he was cast as Franco, essentially recasting James Franco&#x27;s original character. Howarth is listed as a full-time contract cast member. On March 9, 2021, the character was written off after being fatally shot by Peter August (Wes Ramsey). That same day, it was announced Howarth had temporarily departed &quot;General Hospital&quot;, however, would return at a later date. He made his last appearance as Franco Baldwin on March 11, 2021. He returned on May 27 in the role of Dr. Austin Gatlin-Holt. In November 2023, Howarth announced his departure from &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Personal life==
Howarth met actress Cari Stahler in New York City when he lived above the cafÃ© where she worked. She asked him out on a date, which took place at Coney Island. They later married, and now have two children.

<text>&quot;The One with the Monkey&quot; is the tenth episode of theÂ NBCÂ television seriesÂ &quot;Friends&quot;. It is the tenth episode of the show&#x27;s first season and was broadcast on December 15, 1994. This episode marks the first appearance of Marcel, a monkey that Ross (David Schwimmer) adopts to keep him company. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) meets scientist David, though their relationship is short-lived, when David gets a grant to work in Minsk. The gang all make a no-date pact for their New Year&#x27;s Eve party, though all of them save for Ross end up breaking it, with undesired consequences.

==Plot==
In order to curb his loneliness after his divorce, Ross adopts a capuchin monkey named Marcel. Things start off on rocky footing â Marcel seems rebellious and unwilling to listen to Ross. However, Chandler bonds with him almost immediately. With New Year&#x27;s fast approaching, Chandler proposes that the gang make a no-date pact and have dinner together on New Year&#x27;s Eve, which everyone agrees to.

Phoebe sings 13 new songs she has written â all of them about her mother&#x27;s suicide. During her set, she is interrupted by two scientists arguing over her performance. She goes to confront them, and finds out that one of them â David (Hank Azaria) â thinks that she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen even though his partner, Max, begs to differ. Phoebe and David begin dating and she asks Chandler for permission to break the no-date pact for New Year&#x27;s. He agrees as he has already asked Janice, having snapped at the thought of being alone despite how annoying she is.

As the days pass, Monica plans on bringing her ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby, Rachel learns that Paolo will catch an earlier flight back to the US from Italy for New Year&#x27;s, and Joey invites Sandy, a single mom he meets while working as one of Santa&#x27;s elves at the mall. When Ross objects to all his friends breaking their no-date pact, Rachel suggests turning their New Year&#x27;s dinner into a New Year&#x27;s party to compensate so no one knows who is with whom. Max arrives and tells Phoebe that he and David have gotten a grant to study in Minsk for three years, and will be leaving on New Year&#x27;s Day. When she goes to congratulate David, he and Max inform her that he has rejected the opportunity to go, wishing to stay in New York with her.

The six friends end up keeping their no-date pact after all: Ross arrives at the party with only Marcel. Paolo has missed his flight, and Rachel gets attacked outside of the airport by a woman who thinks Rachel has stolen her cab. Max informs David that he is leaving for Minsk alone, and Phoebe convinces him to go with him, telling him he cannot stay just for her. Fun Bobby is depressed because his grandfather has just died, and makes the party even more depressing. Sandy not only brings her kids to the party, but she hooks up with Max. Chandler tries to tell Janice that he only invited her for New Year&#x27;s, but she gets upset at him and storms off.

At midnight, Phoebe is too sad to kiss anyone, Rachel&#x27;s lip was cut in the attack so she cannot kiss anyone, and Monica does not feel like kissing anybody. Chandler demands someone kiss him anyway â so Joey obliges.

== Reception ==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the episode a B, saying the episode introduces the monkey that was &quot;perhaps &quot;Friends&quot;â³ biggest blunder â forcing Schwimmer to do comedy opposite a simian is beneath him.&quot; The episode &quot;illustrates the writer&#x27; tendency to overplot&quot; (such as having Rachel get into a catfight at the airport), &quot;and the multiple story lines never quite jell. Still, any ep that gives Phoebe center stage gets bumped up a grade.&quot;

Sam Ashurst from Digital Spy ranked it #120 on their ranking of the 236 &quot;Friends&quot; episodes, and called it a &quot;strong, early episode&quot;.

&quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; wrote that the show stealer was Chandler&#x27;s line &quot;You don&#x27;t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I&#x27;m talking loud!&quot;

Distractify ranked it the number one &quot;Friends&quot; Christmas episode.
