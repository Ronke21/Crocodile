<text>The Canadian Federation of Students (CFS) is a student organization in Canada, representing over 530,000 students from across Canada. Formed in 1981, the stated goal of the Federation is to represent the collective voice of Canadian students and work at the federal level for high quality, accessible post-secondary education. The CFS has its roots in Canada&#x27;s long tradition of having national student organizations, such as formerly the National Union of Students (Canada), the Canadian Union of Students, the National Federation of Canadian University Students, the Canadian Student Assembly, and the Student Christian Movement of Canada (SCM).

CFS is composed of member local student unions. All members of the Canadian Federation of Students pay membership dues as a part of their membership.

In Canadian student politics, the decision of whether a student union should be a member of the Federation is a contentious issue, and the organization&#x27;s processes for joining or leaving its membership has been the subject of much debate.

==Structure==
The name &quot;Canadian Federation of Students&quot; is generally used to designate three legally distinct organizations: the national CFS, one of the provincial components of the Federation, and/or CFS-Services.

CFS and CFS-Services share the same bylaws and decision-making structures. These structures include biannual general meetings, where every member students&#x27; union receives one vote regardless of the size of their local membership, and an executive, which includes representatives of each provincial affiliate. In provinces where a significant number of students&#x27; unions are members of the CFS, the affiliated component (e.g. CFS-Ontario, CFS-NS) has its own general meetings and executive, the latter being formed by representatives of the local students&#x27; unions. In October 2009 CFS-Quebec ceased to operate as a recognized provincial affiliate of the CFS.

==History==
The CFS was officially formed on October 18, 1981, from the merger of two national organizations - the National Union of Students in Canada and the Association of Student Councils - and student federations from five Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Saskatchewan). The goal of the merger was to create a united student movement in Canada that could provide student-oriented services and political representation at the federal and provincial levels of government. Part of the impetus to organize came from the federal government&#x27;s announcement of $2 billion of cuts from Established Program Financing (including cuts to federal transfer payments for health and education). Another impetus was raising tuition fees, which had been a major issue for CFS&#x27; precursor organization. the NUS, starting in the late 1970s.

===Founding conference===
The founding conference was held at Carleton University between October 14–19, 1981. Mike McNeil was elected as the organization&#x27;s first Chairperson, along with Mike Walker (Treasurer), former NUS treasurer Kirk Falconer (International Affairs Commissioner), Kathie Cram (Women&#x27;s Commissioner), Brian Robinson (Graduate Student Representative), Ben Freedman (Member at Large), and Leslie Neilson (Member at Large). The Federation&#x27;s bylaws and constitution were finalized and over 50 motions were passed during the plenary. After hearing speeches by Salvadoran and Chilean students, delegates passed motions condemning human rights violations and anti-student policies in those countries.

A campaign strategy was also launched to oppose the federal government&#x27;s planned cut to Established Program Financing (EPF). The slogan for the campaign was &quot;Access not axe us&quot; and it called for an establishment of an all-grant system and a public inquiry into the future of post-secondary education. The campaign also called for alliance building with community groups and public sector workers to gain support and fight against cutbacks to social programs. The campaign was named after a research report of the same name, by Bruce Tate. The report focused on effects of the Government of Canada&#x27;s cutback to education and highlighted issues such as access and tuition fee levels.

The conference ended with a student presence in Question Period in the House of Commons of Canada, a meeting with Secretary of State Gerald Regan, and a one-on-one debate between Chairperson Mike McNeil and Member of Parliament John Evans (parliamentary secretary to Finance Minister Allan MacEachen) in the Snake Lounge at Carleton University. Delegates attending Question Period were denied entry by security guards. Mike McNeil and delegates were not satisfied with the outcome of the meeting with Gerald Regan.

===Evolution of membership===

====1992-1995====
In 1992, the CFS resolved that it would be a &quot;partner in the International Student Trade, Environment and Development Program.&quot; Member locals were urged &quot;to consider hosting international guests from the US.A and Mexico during the fall of 1992 to contribute to the national dialogue of the effects on the education system of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.&quot; (CFS Minutes, May 24-3th Centre Universitaire Saint-Louis Maillet, Edmundston, New Brunswick).

The CFS reached a membership of 440,000 students from 65 member students&#x27; unions in 1993–1994.

Overall, 20 membership votes were held in 1994–1995, with the net result that 59 member students&#x27; unions formed the CFS in September 1996.

====1995-2007====
Between 1995 and 2007, over twenty students&#x27; unions joined the CFS, including many graduate students&#x27; associations and part-time students&#x27; associations.

Several large undergraduate students&#x27; associations voted to join CFS during the same period. In 2002, the University of Toronto Students&#x27; Administrative Council, which had never been part of a national students&#x27; union before, voted to join the CFS. At the November 2005 Annual General Meeting of the Federation, the positive result of the votes at both University of Manitoba Students&#x27; Union and the University of Saskatchewan Students&#x27; Union were ratified. The latter vote result was challenged by former USSU director, and in 2007, the courts ruled the vote to be of no force or effect. The CFS website continues to list the USSU as Local 17. In October 2007, USSU voted to keep prospective membership in the CFS and hold a referendum in the next two years; however, in September 2009 the USSU voted to rescind that motion and claims that its affiliation with CFS is void.
====2008====
In March 2008, students at four campuses (Cape Breton University, Simon Fraser University, Kwantlen University-College, and Graduate students at University of Victoria) held votes to leave the CFS. The negative media coverage of the CFS was one of the reasons listed by the Kwantlen Student Association representatives for calling the votes. Members at CBU, the SFU and the UVic (graduate students) voted to leave. CFS representatives did not participate in the Cape Breton referendum, noting that the CBUSU failed to give proper notice. Fellow CFS members from other campuses participated in the Simon Fraser vote to leave CFS, but then national chairperson Amanda Aziz stated that problems with the voting process could result in the outcome not being recognized by the CFS. The SFU referendum, overseen by J.J. McCullough, saw a successful turnout with 67% of students voting to leave the CFS; though contested, it was finalized in 2012. The UVGSS result was not contested by the CFS. The Canadian Federation of Students petitioned the BC Supreme Court to postpone the Kwantlen referendum after Kwantlen Students Association representatives hired Schiffner Consultants to run the vote (contrary to CFS bylaws but in accordance with KSA standard operating procedures). Then-KSA chairperson Laura Anderson claimed that the Federation was attempting to stall the vote, but the court granted the CFS the injunction and the vote to leave CFS was rescheduled for April 2008. Three weeks after the referendums at SFU and UVic (graduate students), Kwantlen students voted to remain members of the CFS.

In the fall of 2008, the largest bilingual student association in Canada, the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa, re-joined the CFS. However, in December 2018 the SFUO will no longer be recognized as a student union by the Universities governing bodies, following a termination of their agreement.

====2009====
In October 2009, students at Carleton, Guelph, and Concordia organized a drive to leave CFS, resulting in petitions meeting the threshold necessary to initiate decertification votes. Students at the University of Victoria Students&#x27; Society, and the Graduate Student Association at the University of Calgary collected enough signatures to initiate a decertification vote.

====2010====
In the spring of 2010, undergraduate students at the University of Guelph and the Alberta College of Art and Design and graduate students at the University of Calgary and McGill University attempted to hold decertification votes. Only the Alberta College of Art and Design vote followed the applicable CFS bylaws. Several irregularities in the conduct of the students&#x27; unions at McGill and Calgary were cited by the CFS as reasons for invalidating the decertification votes.

====2011====
In March 2011, undergraduate students at the University of Victoria voted to leave the CFS.

====2012====
In January 2012, students of Laurentian University at Georgian College in Barrie joined the CFS as the Laurentian Students&#x27; Union (Local 111). In a February 7, 2012 article that appeared in The Concordian, it was reported that the CFS was alleging that the Concordia Students&#x27; Union owed $1.8 million in unpaid membership dues going back as far as the 1990s. Lex Gill, then-president of the CSU firmly denied the CFS&#x27; claim, while congratulating the SFSS for &quot;setting the tone&quot; with regards to legal proceedings. After challenging the legitimacy of SFU&#x27;s 2008 referendum, the CFS ultimately settled out of court, leading Simon Fraser University’s student union to officially leave in 2012.

====2018====
In June 2018, after a lengthy conflict between the CFS and the British Columbia Federation of Students (BCFS) over unpaid membership dues, the CFS voted to expel all member unions belonging to the CFS and the BCFS.

==Current campaigns==

===Fight the Fees===
The CFS actively lobbies on tuition-related issues, including meeting with MPs and organizing &quot;days of action&quot; to address such issues as eliminating tuition fees and reductions in interest rates on student loans. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the only province where all public college and university students&#x27; are members of the CFS, students pay the lowest average undergraduate tuition fees in Canada. There, tuition fees were reduced by 25% in the 1990s and have remained frozen. The current Progressive Conservative government has pledged to keep the freeze in place until the end of their mandate, and recently eliminated the interest on the provincial portion of student loans. In 2015, the provincial government in Alberta froze tuition fees.

In British Columbia, the CFS successfully lobbied the former New Democratic Party (NDP) government to introduce tuition fee freezes and reductions.

=== Fairness for International Students ===
In 2017, the CFS launched a campaign in support of international students. On average, international students pay $25,589.00 per year for a general arts degree in Canada; an amount close to four times more than domestic students. In March 2018, the CFS held a lobby week for international students, where students met with MPs and senators to lobby on the three pillars of the campaign: eliminating all differential tuition fees, providing universal public healthcare, and ensuring clear pathways to permanent residency.

===Indigenous student issues===
The Circle of First Nations, Metis and Inuit Students &quot;Circle&quot; is the mechanism with the CFS by which Indigenous students can organize campaigns. The Caucus has its own budget and runs campaigns such as Where&#x27;s the Justice, Not Your Stereotype, No More Stolen Sisters, and ReconciliAction. One of ReconciliAction&#x27;s, the Circle&#x27;s most recent campaign, main goal&#x27;s is to fulfill the Truth and Reconciliation Commission&#x27;s 16th recommendation by increasing support for indigenous language education at post-secondary institutions.

After extensive lobby by CFS members on increased funding for the Post-Secondary Student Support Program, the federal government announced in 2017 an increase of $90 million to the program for indigenous learners.

After serving as the chair of circle for two years, Coty Downey Zacheriah became the first Indigenous National Chairperson of the Canadian Federation of students, and is currently serving his second term.

Prior to 2017, the caucus was named National Aboriginal Caucus, abbreviated as NAC.

=== Sexualized and Gender Based Violence ===
One of the CFS&#x27;s longest-standing campaigns is the &#x27;No Means No&#x27; campaign, now called &#x27;Consent is Mandatory.&#x27; The CFS works closely with on-campus sexual assault centres to challenge rape culture, educate students about sexual consent and combat gender-based violence. In 2018 the federal government announced a National framework to address gender based violence in post-secondary education sector. In 2016, governments in Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia passed legislation requiring post-secondary institutions to have stand-alone sexual assault and harassment policies.

=== Mental Health ===
The CFS campaigns for increased support for on-campus mental health services and overall access to medication and counselling. The campaign saw early success. In 2017 colleges and universities received an additional $6 million of federal funding annually (promised for three years) to provide mental health services and supports for students, bringing the total amount of mental health funding to $15 million a year. In 2018, the Ontario government announced a $2.1 billion investment in mental health services.

=== End the Ban ===
In 1998, the CFS launched a campaign to change Canadian Blood Services&#x27; policy of prohibiting any man who has had sex with a man from donating blood. The campaign garnered significant media attention. In May 2013, Canadian Blood Services changed their lifetime ban to a five-year deferral if, during those five years, men do not have sex with men. In the spring of 2016, Canadian Blood Services changed the deferral to one year.

=== United for Equity ===
The United for Equity campaign &quot;aims to challenge all forms of discrimination and oppression on our campuses, in our communities, and in our student organizing spaces.&quot; The CFS produces a number of materials on challenging racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, islamaphobia and anti-semitism. The organization also helps student unions educate their members about these issues through workshops and awareness-raising. In 2006, the CFS completed a Taskforce on the Needs of Muslim Students.

===Graduate student issues===
The Canadian Federation of Students is the only student organization in Canada with a distinct graduate caucus that elects its own executive and operates with its own budget. Known as the National Graduate Caucus (NGC), it consists of 90,000 graduate students at 29 campuses across Canada.

====Commercialization of research====
The NGC campaigns to oppose commercialization of university research because its research shows that pressures from industry partners can threaten academic freedom and the public interest. It points to cases such as those of Nancy Olivieri and David Healy as examples of commercialization run amok.

====Whistleblowers campaign====
In 2006, the NGC began working with Christopher Radziminski, alumnus from the University of Toronto, to support his battle with the University of Toronto and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) over research conducted with ERCO Worldwide. The former student alleges that a drinking water experiment in Wiarton, Ontario was not accurately reported in scholarly journals, posing a serious health risk to Canadians. The NGC is supporting a judicial review of NSERC&#x27;s decision not to press for an investigation at the University of Toronto.

====Post-residency fees====
The NGC has an active campaign to reduce fees charged to graduate students after their residency period. Graduate student unions affiliated to the NGC urge graduate students to sign pledges that they will not make alumni donations until their university reduces post-residency fees.

====Copyright renewal====
The NGC has been lobbying the federal government in partnership with several organizations over current reform of the &quot;Canadian Copyright Act&quot;. This involves a letter writing campaign to MPs and participation in developing the Creative Commons project.

====Research funding====
The NGC advocates for increased graduate student funding in the form of scholarships and training programmes. In the 2016 federal budget, the Government of Canada allocated an additional $95 million towards public research through the Tri-Council granting agencies.

====BDS====

Although BDS is controversial, the union officially endorsed the campaign in November 2018.

==Services==

The Canadian Federation of Students-Services (CFS-Services) is a legally separate branch of the Federation, founded in the early 1980s as the successor organization to the Association of Students&#x27; Councils Canada (AOSC). Services made available to individual student members or member students&#x27; unions of the CFS include:

* the International Student Identity Card (see below);
* the StudentSaver Discount Card;
* the Student Work Abroad Program (SWAP);
* the National Student Health Network (NSHN), a non-profit health and dental benefits buying consortium;
* a handbook and day planner producing service, which aims to reduce the cost per handbook to the individual students&#x27; unions, through economies of scale;
* Digital services, including web services, a comprehensive web authoring solution for students&#x27; unions that allows them to easily publish and maintain database driven websites;
*Sexual health products, where members can purchase products for their membership at reduced cost;
* UFile, a partnership that allows students to file their taxes for free;
* Ethical Purchasing Network (EPN), which uses members&#x27; collective purchasing power to buy goods that are ethically sourced. Products are fair trade, union-made, or sweatshop-free.

===Travel CUTS===
Travel CUTS (Canadian Universities Travel Service) is a travel agency that was majority-owned and operated by CFS-Services (CFS-S), which operates in Canada and the United States. In 2009, Travel CUTS was sold to Merit Travel Group.

In 1996, the University Students&#x27; Council at the University of Western Ontario initiated a lawsuit against CFS-Services, to be later joined by three other student societies (Alma Mater Society of the University of British Columbia, Queen&#x27;s Alma Mater Society and University of Alberta Students&#x27; Union). The plaintiffs &quot;alleged the CFS-Services illegally transferred assets from the AOSC, including Travel CUTS, to itself at a 1987 meeting&quot;. A settlement was reached in 2006 through which the plaintiffs acquired 24 per cent of Travel CUTS and two seats on its board of directors.

=== International Student Identity Card ===
The CFS is the Canadian issuing agent for the International Student Identity Card (ISIC), an internationally recognized student identification that provides access to discounts on travel and other products. Only CFS members can obtain an ISIC at no charge. The ISIC sells for $20 to students who are not CFS members. The ISIC is considered to be the most direct financial benefit associated with CFS membership.

==Government relations==
A large part of the CFS&#x27; mandate is to lobby the federal government from its national office in Ottawa. Over the years, CFS representatives have testified to dozens of House of Commons committees, including the Standing Committee on Finance and the Standing Committee on Humans Resources Development and Persons with Disabilities (student loans). In 2009, the CFS national chairperson was invited to deliver a workshop on lobbying policy-makers at a conference hosted by the Federated Press.

The 2016 federal budget included several of the CFS&#x27; lobbying recommendations, including a 50% increase to the Canada Student Grants program, a $165 million investment in the Youth Employment Strategy, and additional public research funding.

In addition to the ongoing testimonies and meetings, the CFS holds an annual Lobby Week that brings together dozens of students from across Canada to meet with their local Members of Parliament and Senators. In 2017, over 150 meetings were held to lobby for eliminating domestic &amp; international student tuition fees, student debt relief, investing in indigenous learners, and more graduate research funding.

==Legal cases (advocacy)==

===Student loan bankruptcy===
In 1999, the CFS challenged the legality of the student loan bankruptcy prohibition.

===Translink and free speech===
The legally separate but closely related affiliate, the Canadian Federation of Students-British Columbia (CFS-BC), in participation with the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and British Columbia Teachers&#x27; Federation, won a case against Translink for refusing to put CFS-BC Vote Education advertising on buses that Translink deemed to be partisan advertising during an election. The case was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, where it ruled that Translink&#x27;s actions violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and in doing so, the Court set the precedent that &quot;arms-length&quot; government agencies such as Translink do come under Charter scrutiny.

===Injunction against Fair Elections Act===
In 2014, The Council of Canadians and the Canadian Federation of Students launched a challenge against the &quot;Fair Elections Act&quot;, which the organizations believed would disenfranchise Canadians and prevent the most marginalized people in our society from voting. While the matter is still before the courts, the Liberal government has promised to repeal the changes implemented by the Conservatives, which was the basis of the court challenge.

==Membership disputes==
Historically, the federation has had numerous legal disputes with student unions over its membership rules. Under its rules, student unions are contractually required to pay membership fees to the CFS, even if the student union leadership does not want to remain members of the organization. This arrangement has led to numerous legal battles between the federation and student unions wanting to leave or enter the organization.

===Cape Breton University===
In March 2008, students at Cape Breton University held a vote to leave the CFS, with 92% of voting students supporting exiting the organization. Arguing that the vote failed to follow the organization&#x27;s bylaws regarding notification of referendums, the CFS declined to recognize the results of the vote. After the referendum, the Cape Breton University Students Union (CBUSU) ceased collecting membership fees on behalf of the CFS. In 2009, the CFS filed suit for dues owed; further, in 2015 the Ontario Superior Court ordered the CBUSU to pay $293,000 in unpaid membership fees, plus the CFS&#x27; legal expenses. In August 2015, the CBUSU announced its decision to appeal. In September, 2015, a fourth year CBU student delivered a petition to the CBUSU signed by approximately 30% of the CBU student body seeking a new vote on exiting the CFS. However, the CFS&#x27; bylaws do not allow a member organization to hold an exit referendum while dues remain outstanding.

===Capilano University===
In March 2014, Capilano university students voted by referendum to terminate their membership.

===Concordia University===
The CFS is a defendant in a suit launched by the Concordia Students&#x27; Union seeking recognition of a vote to leave CFS in 2011. The National Executive refused to grant a disaffiliation vote before $1.8 million in alleged outstanding membership fees were remitted. The then-president of the Concordia Students&#x27; Union, Lex Gill, firmly denied this claim: &quot;I am completely firm in my conviction that we do not owe the CFS $1.8 million and never have.&quot; In 2015, CFS Entities and CSU reached an agreement that the CSU &quot;membership has been terminated.&quot; The Concordia Graduate Student Association (GSA) has also terminated its membership. The details of the agreement remain confidential.

===Post-Graduate Students&#x27; Society of McGill University===
In April 2010, members of the Post-Graduate Students&#x27; Society of McGill University (PGSS) voted 86% in favour of ending association with the CFS. The CFS did not recognize the results of this vote, leading the PGSS to file suit. The PGSS&#x27; lawsuit is still in progress. In January 2015, a second referendum on membership was held, following a court order against the CFS in response to a separate lawsuit filed by McGill student Ge Sa seeking recognition of an exit petition forwarded by Sa in 2014. In the 2015 referendum, McGill graduate students voted 2014 to 56 in favour of leaving the CFS.

===Simon Fraser University===
The CFS was a defendant in a case brought by the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS) at Simon Fraser University over the validity of a vote to leave CFS in March 2008. After a summary trial was rejected, the judge ruled that the SFSS had the option of holding another vote or continuing to resolve the legality of the disputed referendum through a trial. The judge urged both parties to consider settling the matter out of court before spending large amounts of money on a full-length trial. In early January, 2012, the CFS/CFS-Services/CFS-British Columbia and the SFSS agreed to an undisclosed settlement and ceased all court action.

===University of Guelph===
The Central Student Association representing undergraduate University of Guelph students submitted an injunction on February 16, 2010, against the CFS and its affiliates for denying the student association a vote to leave CFS as a result of a dispute over the validity of a petition required to initiate the referendum.

Justice O&#x27;Connor of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ordered that a vote be conducted and administered by a referendum oversight committee (ROC) based on CFS bylaws (consisting of two representatives selected by the CFS and two representatives selected by the student association). Justice O&#x27;Connor modified the committee by appointing former Ontario Superior Court Justice James Chadwick as a fifth member of the committee to act as an independent third party to break deadlocks should the two parties disagree on administration of the vote.

The court-ordered referendum was conducted online in early April 2010. Guelph students voted 73.5% in favour of leaving CFS in an online poll conducted by the university administration. CFS and CFS-O appealed Justice O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s decision and the matter was held on May 31, 2011 though the application Judge, Justice O&#x27;Connor, failed to provide any reasons for the decision, making it impossible to review the appeal. The Appeals Court Judges ordered the matter be heard by a different Judge.

===University of Victoria===
The University of Victoria Students&#x27; Society (UVSS) representing undergraduate University of Victoria students submitted legal action against the CFS in November 2010 to seek a vote to leave the Federation. The dispute centered around a petition submitted by UVic student Jose Barrios in the Fall of 2009 that had the required 10% of signatures needed to initiate a referendum. In Spring 2010, the CFS National Executive rejected this petition because hundreds of students signed a second petition calling for their names to be removed from Barrios&#x27; petition list. In November 2010, Barrios initiated legal action against the CFS.

Mr. Justice Malcolm D. Macaulay of the Supreme Court of British Columbia heard oral arguments from both sides on January 6 and 7, 2011. On February 1, 2011, Justice Macaulay ruled that the use of a &#x27;counterpetition&#x27; to nullify the original petition &#x27;must fail&#x27; and ordered that the process to hold a referendum on continued membership must move forward. On the applicability of the second &#x27;counterpetition&#x27;, Justice Macaulay wrote: &quot;The national executive of the CFS invoked a process that was not contemplated by the bylaws in effect at the time and, as a result, applied an irrelevant consideration in determining that the petition was not in order. The adoption of a process outside the bylaws amounted to an excess of jurisdiction.&quot;

The CFS refused to grant a decertification vote until the UVSS paid $100,000+ in outstanding membership dues. The UVSS rejected the claim that it owed money and took the CFS to court on February 17. The UVSS argued that by bringing up this issue so late, the CFS was making an intentional move to delay a vote from occurring before the end of the 2010–2011 academic year. Justice Macaulay ruled for the vote to take place regardless of outstanding dues. In March 2011 UVic undergraduate students voted to leave the Canadian Federation of Students. The National Federation recognized the result, but the CFS-BC refused, claiming the vote did not apply to the provincial affiliate. A subsequent legal battle ensued, leading to a new successful UVSS petition effort to trigger a CFS-BC membership vote. In 2013, one month before the UVSS was scheduled to vote on its CFS-BC membership, the CFS-BC voted to terminate the UVSS&#x27;s membership, marking the official end of all UVSS membership ties to the Canadian Federation of Students.

===Selkirk College===
The Selkirk College Students&#x27; Union representing all Selkirk College students submitted a petition for a vote on continued membership in the CFS in December 2016. The CFS verified that the petition was valid in early 2017. However, no referendum was scheduled by the Canadian Federation of Students at Selkirk College. The Students&#x27; Union asserts that its members followed the process, and that there is no reason not to move forward with a referendum. The CFS asserts that its ongoing dispute with the British Columbia Federation of Students means that students at Selkirk College cannot have a vote on continued membership.

===BCFS Expelled===

After years of dispute, a motion expelling all 12 members of the BCFS was unanimously passed, in the opening plenary of the 71 Semi-annual NGM. Resolving conflict.

== Criticism ==
The CFS has been criticized and remains a controversial topic in student politics.

The CFS has been labeled as anti-semitic by many Canadian Jewish organizations. During the 2019 CFS Referendum at Carleton University, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada, StandWithUs Canada, Hasbara Fellowships Canada, and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity released a letter calling on Ontario university students to opt-out of paying dues to CFS due to the organization&#x27;s support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctioning of Israel.

The CFS has been criticized for its management of the mandatory student-paid fees that it collects. For instance, a forensic audit conducted by accounting firm Grant Thornton LLP uncovered a hidden bank account controlled by the CFS with over $260,000 inside. The CFS failed to release the full forensic review as to what these unauthorized funds were spent on between July 2010 and December 2014.

Another area of criticism has been the CFS&#x27;s strict processes for decertification. The CFS is also criticised for being ineffective, with one student stating that &quot;They don&#x27;t put enough emphasis on focused lobbying of elected officials, and continue to prefer the protests and sit-ins.&quot; This criticism has been dismissed by many given the organization&#x27;s annual Lobby Week where students from across the country meet with MPs and senators to push for affordable post-secondary education, and the CFS&#x27;s presence on a variety of government committees. On the other hand, some Quebec student unions criticized the CFS for being too focused on government lobbying. The more radical protest focused culture of Quebec student politics was seen are incommensurate with the moderate CFS agenda.

When student unions hold referendums on joining the CFS, many CFS staff members campaign on campuses, despite not being students. In instances where students have voted to leave the CFS, the federation has opted to use student money to sue these schools for democratically choosing to leave the organization.

<doc id="709513" wikidata="Q7532988" url="?curid=709513" title="Sixes River">
<text>The Sixes River flows about through coastal forests in southwestern Oregon in the United States. It drains a rugged region of the Klamath Mountains along the Pacific north of Port Orford.

It rises in the mountains of northern Curry County, south of Sugarloaf Mountain in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest. It flows generally west, through Grassy Knob Wilderness and the small community of Sixes, and eventually enters the Pacific just north of Cape Blanco, the westernmost point in Oregon. The mouth of the river is along the coast in Cape Blanco State Park.

==Name==
Accounts vary as to the origin of the name &quot;Sixes&quot;. One local postmaster said Sixes was named for a Native American chief. Another source said that in 1851, the river was usually called the &quot;Sikhs River&quot; after the Chinook Jargon word for &quot;friend&quot;, and on maps it was called the &quot;Sequalchin River&quot;. Another source says the Native American name for the river was &quot;Sa-qua-mi&quot;. Hodge&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of American Indians&quot; says that one of the variants of the name of the local tribe, the Kwatami (a subdivision of the Tututni), was &quot;Sik-ses-tene&quot;, which is said to mean &quot;people by the far north country&quot;. Though this is most likely the real source of the name, the spelling &quot;Sixes&quot; was probably used by miners drawn to the Oregon gold rush who were familiar with the Chinook word &quot;sikhs&quot;. The current spelling was used as early as 1855.

==Copper Salmon Wilderness==
In 2009, along the north and south forks of the Elk River and the upper Middle Fork Sixes River were designated as the Copper Salmon Wilderness. The area contains one of the nation&#x27;s largest stands of low-elevation old-growth forest. Wildlife species include salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, marbled murrelets, northern spotted owls, and Roosevelt elk, among others.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries from source to mouth are Murphy Canyon, Haines Creek, North Fork Sixes River, Sugar and Sucker creeks, followed by the Middle Fork Sixes River. Below this come Big and Otter creeks, then the South Fork Sixes River. Further downstream are Elephant Rock, Little Dry, Pipeline, Dry, Edson, Koch, Jenny, Beaver, and Crystal creeks. Last is Sullivan Gulch.

<doc id="709519" wikidata="Q367733" url="?curid=709519" title="John Burke (North Dakota politician)">
<text>John Burke (February 25, 1859 – May 14, 1937) was an American lawyer, jurist, and political leader from North Dakota who served as the tenth governor of North Dakota from 1907 to 1913, and later served as the 24th treasurer of the United States under President Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1921. Following his term as treasurer, he subsequently served intermittently as Chief Justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court first from 1929 to 1931, then from 1935 until his death in 1937.

==Early life==
Burke was born in Sigourney, Iowa of Irish ancestry to John and Mary (née Ryan) Burke. He graduated from the University of Iowa in 1886 with a law degree. He married Mary Ellen Kane, a teacher, on August 22, 1891, and they later had three children.

After establishing two separate practices of middling success in the late 1880s, Burke moved to the Dakota Territory poor in 1888 where he acquired work wherever he could before settling down in St. John in Rolette County.

==Career==
Following his move to St. John, Burke began a legal practice and subsequently became a Rolette County judge in 1889.

Two years after the admission of North Dakota to the United States, Burke was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives in 1891 and later served in the North Dakota Senate from 1893 to 1896. In 1896, Burke unsuccessfully sought election to the United States House of Representatives for the Democratic Party, losing by 4,000 votes. Following this, Burke returned to Rolette County, serving as a county judge for another term from 1897 to 1899.

After reluctantly accepting the nomination to run for governor of North Dakota by unanimous vote, Burke secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and ousted incumbent Elmore Sarles in what was called the &#x27;Revolution of 1906&#x27;, being the first step in the dismantling of Republican National committeeman Alexander McKenzie&#x27;s political machine. Burke&#x27;s campaign attracted wide bipartisan support, mostly those Republicans and other majority groups who had distaste for the incumbent Sarles administration, and the McKenzie political machine which had dominated the state for the previous 20 years. Following his taking of office, Burke, a new-era progressive, instituted and pursued policies against the railroad monopolists which had dominated state politics previously, and a number of reforms against corruption, which Burke personally despised and had crusaded against in all offices. His personality, political beliefs, and actions had garnered him the nickname &#x27;Honest John&#x27;, a name which Burke himself disliked, not wanting to be compared to President Abraham Lincoln, who was nicknamed &#x27;Honest Abe&#x27; A number of reforms affecting working conditions were also carried out during his time as governor. 

At the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Burke enthusiastically supported the candidacy of Woodrow Wilson. Burke swung all of North Dakota&#x27;s votes to Wilson on the first ballot. William Jennings Bryan, himself a supporter of Wilson and also a good friend of Burke&#x27;s, wanted Burke to run for vice president. Burke demurred, however, due to a promise he had given Indiana delegates for their votes. As a result, Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana was chosen instead for the vice presidency. Burke was named United States Treasurer following Wilson&#x27;s election victory in November 1912. From 1913 to 1921, Burke was Treasurer of the United States under President Woodrow Wilson before he resigned two months prior to Wilson&#x27;s leaving office to start a brokerage firm on Wall Street. During his term as treasurer, Burke ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1916.

Following his resignation from the treasury, Burke founded the Kardos &amp; Burke brokerage firm with businessman Louis Montgomery Kardos Jr. on Wall Street. In 1924, the firm was made defunct after Kardos was found guilty of criminally defrauding investors in a bucket shop scheme. Burke was later exonerated of any association with the crimes, with his only personal investment being the loan which founded the firm. To please investigators, Burke sold all of his property and gave up a large amount of his wealth before moving back to Fargo, North Dakota.

He later served as a justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court, a position he had always desired, from 1924 to 1937. During this time he served as chief justice twice, from 1929 to 1931, and from 1935 to 1937.

==Death and legacy==
In the midst of his second term as chief justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court, Burke developed a pulmonary edema. For the edema, he underwent an operation to relieve it, but died following the operation on May 14, 1937.

Following Burke&#x27;s death, many politicians and officials mourned and remembered Burke for his character and ideals. By many, Burke is considered to be one of the greatest North Dakota politicians. During his lifetime, many called Burke a hero, as well as &#x27;the first citizen of North Dakota&#x27;. His remains are interred in Saint Mary&#x27;s Cemetery, Bismarck, North Dakota.

Burke County, North Dakota is named in honor of John Burke. The World War II ship SS &quot;John Burke&quot; is also named after Burke.

In 1963, the State of North Dakota donated a statue of Burke to the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. A similar statue also stands on the grounds of the North Dakota State Capitol in Bismarck.

<text>:&quot;This article about the geographical entity. For the American band, see Talking Heads post-breakup, for the UK stoner rock band, see The Heads (UK band)&quot;

The Heads is a rocky cape on the Pacific Ocean coast of southwestern Oregon in the United States. It is located in northern Curry County, just outside the town of Port Orford, along a mountainous stretch of coast bounded to the east by the Coastal Range. The cape is part of Port Orford Heads State Park.

It is approximately 5 mi (8 km) south along the coast from Cape Blanco, the westernmost point in the state of Oregon.

<text>Tomasz Nałęcz (born 29 October 1949 in Gołymin) is a Polish historian, leftist politician, former vice-Speaker of the Sejm, a former member of the Social Democracy of Poland party (SdPl)
In the past he used to be member of the communist Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) (1970–1990) and later its social-democratic successor, Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland. In the years 1993-2004 he was a prominent member of Labour Union. He left the Labour Union after SdPl was founded by Marek Borowski.

In 2003–2004 Nałęcz was also the chairman of the Sejm&#x27;s special parliamentary inquiring committee which tried to unravel the Lew Rywin affair.

In December 2009 Nałęcz was selected as the SdPl&#x27;s candidate for the election due to take place in autumn 2010. However, following the Smolensk plane crash which killed incumbent president Lech Kaczyński and brought forward the election to June, Nałęcz withdrew from the contest.

<text>The J-SH04 was a mobile phone made by Sharp Corporation and released by J-Phone (SoftBank Mobile). It was only available in Japan, and was released in November 2000. It was Japan&#x27;s second phone with a built-in, back-facing camera. It has a 110,000 pixel CMOS image sensor and a 256 color display. The phone weights 74g, and its dimensions are 127 × 39 × 17 mm. It was succeeded by the J-SH05 flip phone, which was released just one month later. It is also considered to be one of the first phones with polyphonic ringtones.

While the J-SH04 popularized the concept of a camera phone (branded as Sha-Mail) and was the world&#x27;s first fully integrated camera and telephone over a cellular mobile network, it had a number of predecessors. In December 1997, Kyocera released the VP-110, which was a PCMCIA videophone adapter with an 80,000-pixel CCD camera that swiveled 210° and attached to the DataScope DS-110 and DS-320 mobile phones. Kyocera released the first commercial mobile camera-phone in September 1999, the VP-210 Visual Phone which had a front-facing 110,000-pixel CMOS camera enabling both video calling and sending photos over the air. The VP-210 could send its still images as mail attachments or send video at 2 frames per second over a PHS network. In contrast, the J-SH04&#x27;s camera on the back of the phone was designed to take photos facing away from the user, which was a more popular way to use digital cameras at the time than video calling and selfie photos. The SH04 was the transformational moment for the camera phone.

Samsung&#x27;s SCH-V200 phone equipped with a VGA camera was released in South Korea several months before the J-SH04. The Samsung SCH-V200&#x27;s camera was inside the same case as the phone and used the same battery and memory, but it was not integrated with the phone function. It could not convey an image &quot;at a distance,&quot; which some regard as part of the definition of a &quot;camera phone.&quot; Instead, photos taken by the SCH-V200 had to be transferred to a PC in order to be sent over a network.

<text>Robert Leonard Burch Jr. (born September 30, 1949) is an American politician of the Democratic party.

In 1994, Burch, then an Ohio state senator, was the Democratic nominee for Ohio governor and he ran to unseat incumbent Republican Gov. George Voinovich. Burch&#x27;s campaign was woefully underfunded against Voinovich&#x27;s $8 million warchest and although he campaigned hard, his name never registered with the public and he was buried in the general election, winning only a quarter of the vote and joining his fellow Ohio Democrats in a series of defeats.

In 1996 and 1998, Burch ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives (Ohio&#x27;s 18th district), but lost to incumbent Republican Robert W. Ney both times.

<doc id="709530" wikidata="Q1427367" url="?curid=709530" title="Orthopraxy">
<text>In the study of religion, orthopraxy is correct conduct, both ethical and liturgical, as opposed to faith or grace. Orthopraxy is in contrast with orthodoxy, which emphasizes correct belief. The word is a neoclassical compound— () meaning &#x27;right practice&#x27;.

While orthodoxies make use of codified beliefs in the form of creeds and ritualism more narrowly centers on the strict adherence to prescribed rites or rituals, orthopraxy is focused on issues of family, cultural integrity, the transmission of tradition, sacrificial offerings, concerns of purity, ethical system, and the enforcement thereof.

In Hinduism, orthopraxy and ritualism are often interconnected. Judaism and Christianity are also considered both religions and orthopraxies, as they guide adherents in both practice and belief.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;orthopraxy&quot; comes from the Greek , meaning &quot;straight&quot;, and , meaning &quot;action&quot;. First used in 1851, there are two versions of the term: &quot;orthopraxis&quot; and &quot;orthopraxy&quot;. &quot;Orthopraxy&quot; is the older and more common term.

==Types of Orthopraxy==

===Christianity===


Although traditionally Christianity is seen as primarily orthodoxical (as in the Nicene Creed&#x27;s &quot;I believe in ...&quot;), some Christian denominations and leaders today, from Catholic to Evangelical Christians, have started to describe their religions as both orthodoxical and orthopraxic. The premise is correct belief compels correct action, and incorrect action is caused by incorrect beliefs.

Taking this combination of &quot;correct belief&quot; and &quot;correct action&quot; a step further, prosperity theology, found in charismatic and Pentecostal traditions, teaches correct religious belief and behavior receives material reward and physical healing, in addition to being a necessary component for accepting God&#x27;s grace. Prosperity theology is a concept known as reciprocity when discussing traditional or ethnic religions such as that in Ancient Greece, but is limited to correct behavior over any one theological idea.

The applicability of biblical law in Christianity is disputed. Most Christians believe that some or all of the Ten Commandments are still binding or have been reinstituted in the law of Christ. A minority of Christians are Torah-observant and at the other extreme are antinomian and Christian anarchistic views.

====Eastern Christianity====
Praxis is a key to understanding the Byzantine tradition, which is observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church and some Eastern Catholic Churches. This is because praxis is the basis of the understanding of faith and works as conjoint, without separating the two. The importance of praxis, in the sense of action, is indicated in the dictum of Saint Maximus the Confessor: &quot;Theology without action is the theology of demons.&quot;

Union with God, to which Christians hold that Jesus invited man, requires not just faith, but correct practice of faith. This idea is found in the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 11:2,
2 Thessalonians 2:14) and the Church Fathers, and is linked with the term &quot;praxis&quot; in Byzantine theology and vocabulary. In the context of Orthodoxy, praxis is mentioned opposite theology, in the sense of &#x27;theory and practice&#x27;. Rather, it is a word that means, globally, all that Orthodox do. Praxis is &#x27;living Orthodoxy&#x27;.

Praxis is perhaps most strongly associated with worship. &quot;Orthopraxis&quot; is said to mean &quot;right glory&quot; or &quot;right worship&quot;; only correct (or proper) practice, particularly correct worship, is understood as establishing the fulness glory given to God. This is one of the primary purposes of liturgy (divine labor), the work of the people. Some Byzantine sources maintain that in the West, Christianity has been reduced &quot;to intellectual, ethical or social categories,&quot; whereas right worship is fundamentally important in our relationship to God, forming the faithful into the Body of Christ and providing the path to &quot;true religious education&quot;. A &quot;symbiosis of worship and work&quot; is considered to be inherent in Byzantine praxis.

===Hinduism===
Hinduism places an emphasis on orthopraxy in that it is concerned with sanātana dharma (everlasting dharma, with dharma meaning, roughly, appropriate ways to live).

In the case of Hinduism orthopraxy and ritualism are conflated. Emphasis on ritual vs. personal salvation (&quot;moksha&quot;) was a major division in classical Hindu philosophy, epitomized by Purva Mimamsa vs. Uttara Mimamsa (Vedanta).

Ritual (&quot;puja&quot;) continues to play a central role in contemporary Hinduism, but the enormous complexity of ancient ritual (&quot;yajna&quot;) only survives in a tiny minority of Shrauta practitioners. Even Hindus who diligently practice a subset of prescribed rituals are called orthoprax, to contrast them with other Hindus who insist on the importance of correct belief or understanding. The correctness of one&#x27;s interpretation of the scripture is then considered less important than following traditions. For example, Srinivasa Ramanujan was a well-known example of an orthoprax Hindu.

In terms of &quot;proper conduct&quot; and other ethical precepts within the Hindu framework, the core belief involves the divinity of each individual soul (&quot;jivatma&quot;). Each person harbors this &quot;indwelling God (divinity)&quot;; thus, conduct which unifies society and facilitates progress is emphasized. Self-centered existence is discouraged as a result of this &quot;jivatma&quot; concept. The Uttara Mimamsa philosophical school explicates this concept eloquently. Moreover, within the context of Uttara Mimamsa the role of &quot;puja&quot; (ritual) also involves bringing the individual &quot;jivatma&quot; closer to the &quot;Paramatma&quot; (the Transcendent Divinity or God). Individuals who have attained this merging then become the spiritual guides to the community. Later developments within the Hindu religious and philosophic tradition thus try to unify these concepts of ritual, proper conduct, and personal salvation instead of leaving them in mutually conflicting terms. The movement inspired by Pandurang Shastri Athavale termed &quot;Swadhyaya&quot; seems to be one manifestation of this syncretism. However, other movements within the contemporary Hindu scene are also moving towards this union of external activity and internal development.

===Islam===

Islam generally stresses orthopraxy over orthodoxy. This can be seen in the fact that the account to be rendered on the day of judgement (yaum al-Din) is one of works. However, since the practice is held to come from doctrine, this is essentially orthodoxy applied to practice.

===Jainism===
Jain orthopraxy is based on two factors: Jain siddhanta (teachings of the Tirthankara) and &quot;kriya&quot; (practices prevalent at the time of the Tirthankaras). According to Jains, the Tirthankaras based their teachings and philosophy after knowing the realities on this universe (like &quot;dravya&quot; and &quot;tattva&quot;). Based on these realities, they propounded true and eternal principles like &quot;ahimsa&quot;, truth, karma etc. that govern the universe. Jain rituals were codified on the basis of these principles to give effect to the teachings of the Tirthankaras.

===Judaism===


Judaism is also considered both a religion and orthopraxy as it guides its adherents in both practice and belief.

Judaism attaches primary importance to the practice of the &quot;mitzvot&quot;, and that each act of daily life comply with the ethical and ritual teachings of the Torah. However, these gestures are intended to be motivated by the system of values and ethics of which they are a part, so that orthodoxy is not seen as simply a way of thinking according to established dogmas.

Moreover, Maimonides codifies his 13 principles of faith as a binding theological dogma, and according to Maimonides some laws of the Torah require the acceptance of certain basic beliefs, such as the first and second positive commandments in Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Sefer Hamitzvot&quot;, which mandate the belief in God and his indivisible unity, or the recitation of the &quot;Shema&quot;. Maimonides&#x27; codification of Jewish law even contains a section entitled &quot;Yesodei HaTorah&quot;, which delineates the required beliefs of Judaism.

===Neopaganism===
====British Traditional Wicca====
British Traditional Wicca is highly orthopraxic, with &quot;traditions&quot; (as denominations are called) being precisely that — defined by what is traditionally done, rather than shared beliefs. Other Neopagans may or may not share this quality, as noted by James R. Lewis, who draws a distinction between &quot;Religious Neo-Pagans&quot; and &quot;God/dess Celebrants.&quot; Lewis states the majority of the neopagan movement is strongly opposed to religionist traditions that incorporate any form of orthopraxy or orthodoxy. In fact, many Neopagan organizations, when discussing orthopraxy, limit themselves solely to ritualism.

====Kemetism====
Kemetism is the revival of Ancient Egyptian religious practices. They honor and follow their own selection of &quot;neter&quot; (Ancient Egyptian Deities; Egyptian Language: , ). They may choose to incorporate Ancient Egyptian philosophies in their daily lives.

====Polytheistic reconstructionism====

Reconstructionist religions make full use of orthopraxy, defining their practices as a lifestyle, and identifying correct action as living life in accord with specific ideals and principles, rather than focusing solely on ritual or promoting a single cosmology, metaphysical idea, or theological theory as absolute truth.

===Taoism===
Taoism understands the right way of living as one that is in alignment with the Tao, &quot;The Way&quot;, referring to the way of the universe - the patterns of existence around us, which are constantly being explored, understood, and re-interpreted. If you are living in accordance with the pattern of the Tao - the source, the universe, the pattern of everything - you are living rightly.

<text>Mount Royal Cemetery (French: Cimetière Mont-Royal) is a terraced cemetery on the north slope of Mount Royal in the borough of Outremont in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It opened in 1852. Temple Emanu-El Cemetery, a Reform Judaism burial ground, is within the Mount Royal grounds. The burial ground shares the mountain with the much larger adjacent Roman Catholic cemetery, Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery, and the Shaar Hashomayim Cemetery, an Ashkenazi Jewish cemetery. Mount Royal Cemetery is bordered on the southeast by Mount Royal Park, on the west by Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery, and on the north by Shaar Hashomayim Cemetery. It is known for its stunning views, birdwatching, cheery mix of old and new graves, meticulous upkeep, and diversity of trees. In the springtime, the Lilac Knoll section is flush with hydrangeas, and autumn leaf walking tours are frequent.

Although the cemetery is non-denominational today, it continues to be governed by its original charter, with a board of trustees representing the founding Protestant denominations. The cemetery is a private non-profit organization. While most sections of the cemetery are mixed, there are ‘neighbourhoods’ suitable for different communities and their burial needs, with rich histories. 

Burial rights have always been offered in perpetuity, with the commitment that no graves would ever be reused or abandoned. The founding charter stipulates that all profits should be entirely devoted to the embellishment and improvement of the property. Mount Royal Cemetery is still in operation, and even the older portions of the cemetery have some burial sites available, although casket-sized graves are increasingly in short supply.

==Design==
===Crematory===
The first crematory in Canada was built by Sir Andrew Taylor in 1901 on the eastern side of the Mount Royal Cemetery property with funds donated by Sir William Christopher Macdonald, a well-known tobacco tycoon and great philanthropist. This building is the oldest of its kind in the country and it remained the only crematorium in Quebec until 1975. The first cremation took place on April 18, 1902.

Built with Montreal limestone, the original building had a chapel, a room for the cremation chambers, a large winter storage vault and a conservatory filled with exotic plants. In the 1950s, for maintenance reasons, the conservatory was demolished but the original chapel, on the left of the building, is still intact with a handmade mosaic floor and casket-door that lowers to the crematorium and prep rooms beneath. The gatehouse to the left of the Chemin de la Forêt entrance, as well as the cemetery office, are some of the original structures — waiting attendants used to wait in the gatehouse for their carriages during the winter.

===War Graves section===
The cemetery contains 459 war graves of Commonwealth service personnel, 276 from World War I and 183 from World War II, most of which form two War Plots in Section G. A Cross of Sacrifice stands on the boundary with Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery.

Military graves at Mount Royal did not take significance until World War I, when Canada lost over 60 000 soldiers. After this event, the population of the city started taking public memory more seriously, and gave an entire section of the cemetery to war veterans and fallen soldiers.

<text>Oldway Mansion is a large house and gardens in Paignton, Devon, England. It was built as a private residence for Isaac Singer (1811–1875), and rebuilt by his son Paris Singer, in the style of the Palace of Versailles.

==History==
===19th century===
Around 1871, the Fernham estate in Paignton was purchased by Isaac Singer, the founder of the Singer Sewing Machine Company. The old buildings on the site were demolished and he commissioned a local architect, George Soudon Bridgman, to build a new mansion as his home. As part of the designs, Singer instructed Bridgman to build a theatre within the house. Bridgman was at that time being apprenticed by a young Frank Matcham, who had just returned from London where he had been studying architecture in a surveyors office. In an edition of &quot;The Builder&quot;, dated 1873, Matcham was named in the request for tender section as being the accepted party to work alongside Bridgman on the Oldway Mansion project. The architectural historian Gorel Garlick considers it entirely possible that Matcham was given sole responsibility by Bridgman for the theatre&#x27;s design because of his educational experiences in London. Singer spared no cost in terms of Oldway Mansion&#x27;s construction; he sourced the finest materials from around the world and instructed Bridgman to design the interior in exuberant French style. Garlick notes that it was highly likely that Singer&#x27;s exuberance would have influenced someone as architecturally impressionable as Matcham, whose later theatres used such extravagant decoration. The mansion was built in 1873. Singer died on 23 July 1875, and work on the mansion continued after his death.
Paris Singer, a son of Isaac Singer, supervised the alterations at Oldway Mansion between 1904 and 1907. The rebuilding work was modelled on the Palace of Versailles, and the eastern elevation of the building was inspired by the Place de la Concorde in Paris. The interior of the building is noted for its grand staircase made from marble, and balusters of bronze. The ceiling of the staircase is decorated with an ornate painting based on an original design for the Palace of Versailles for Louis XIV by the French painter and architect Charles Le Brun.

Above the grand staircase, there is a reproduction of the first version of Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s painting &quot;The Crowning of Josephine by Napoleon&quot;. The original was purchased by Paris Singer in the late 19th century; the painting was sold to the French government in 1946 and now hangs in the Palace of Versailles. The reproduction at the mansion, which hangs in the same place as the original did, is a copy made by Rutters Scanachrome and was unveiled in 1995.

The gallery on the first floor is a reproduction of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, and it is floored in parquet. The gallery leads into the ballroom, which contains walls of gilt panelling and mirrors. Above the fireplace, there is an oil painting of Louis de Bourbon dating from 1717.

Oldway Mansion is set in of gardens, which were laid out on an Italian theme by the French landscape gardener Achille Duchêne. Beneath the eastern elevation of the building is the maze, which consists of dwarf box hedging and flower beds. To the south of the mansion, there is a grotto garden, where a waterfall passes over a rocky cave into a pool below. The grounds of the mansion contain many sub-tropical plants and shrubs.
Opposite the main entrance to the mansion is a large round building known as The Rotunda. This was built in 1873, and it was used originally as a horse riding pavilion and exercise area. Isaac Singer gave this building the nickname of &quot;The Wigwam&quot;.

The formal gardens and parkland are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

===20th century===
A rock garden was laid out between 1900 and 1902 by Devon landscape gardener F. W. Meyer using 1,000 tonnes of stone.

Following the end of an affair with the dancer Isadora Duncan in 1917, Paris Singer became an American citizen and went to live in the United States. This was done partly for tax reasons, and after 1918, Oldway Mansion was no longer the permanent home of the Singer family.

During the period of the First World War from 1914 to 1918, Oldway Mansion was transformed into the American Women&#x27;s War Relief Hospital. The Rotunda was converted to house rows of beds for the wounded soldiers being brought back to England from the trenches of France and Belgium. King George V visited the mansion in 1915.

Oldway Mansion became the Torbay Country Club in 1929. During this period, tennis courts and a bowling green were added to the grounds.

Torbay Golf &amp; Country Club opened in 1933. Oldway Mansion was used as the club house, with the course in the hills above the Mansion. The course closed in the mid-1950s.

During the Second World War from 1939 to 1945, Oldway was used in the war effort by housing RAF cadets training to be aircrew. In 1943, Oldway was damaged in an air raid, along with many other buildings in Paignton.
==Modern history and disuse of the building==
Paignton Urban District Council purchased Oldway Mansion from the Singer family in 1946 for £46,000. It is estimated that around £200,000 was spent on building the mansion. Until 2013, the building was used as council offices and for civil marriage ceremonies. Oldway Mansion has been a Grade II* listed building since 1993.

In January 2007, Torbay Council announced that it was considering selling the mansion, as it had become too expensive to maintain. The suggestion was controversial since local residents argued that the mansion was sold at a reduced price on the understanding that it would be open to the public. On 30 April 2012, plans for Oldway Mansion to be converted into a luxury hotel and sheltered retirement flats were approved by Torbay Council. The deal was finalised in September 2012.

Oldway Mansion has been closed since Torbay Council stopped using the buildings in 2013, although the grounds have remained open to the public. The bowling green is still in use, but the tennis courts are closed.

In January 2016, it was reported that the property developer Akkeron had filed a claim for more than £8 million in damages against Torbay Council, due to a dispute over the leases which it said had caused a delay in starting work on the redevelopment. Torbay Council rejected the claim and said that it would defend itself against the allegations &quot;robustly&quot;. On 15 August 2016, it was reported that the agreement between Torbay Council and Akkeron to develop the mansion had been terminated. The legal dispute brought an end to the redevelopment plans, and the work on the site was never started.

A 2018 proposal by the elected Mayor of Torbay to sell the building was rejected by councillors. In January 2019, it was announced that Torbay Council had begun the process of setting up a charitable trust to allow community management of the building, with the aim of re-opening it. In March 2019, it was reported that planned open days allowing the public to see inside the mansion had been scrapped, as the building was in an unsafe condition. A bid was submitted to the National Lottery Heritage Fund for approximately £10 million to support a restoration scheme.

By 2020 the grotto, which is made of steel and concrete and lined with limestone, had deteriorated and become subject to vandalism leaving it at risk of collapse. As a result of this Torbay Council applied for planning permission to temporarily seal up the grotto using steel mesh. In January 2021, Torbay Council applied for permission to demolish the 1930s squash courts adjacent to the Mansion and Rotunda, as they were in a poor condition and putting other parts of the site at risk.

The building was added to Historic England&#x27;s &#x27;Heritage at Risk&#x27; Register in 2023.

==Other uses==
Oldway Mansion has been used as a film location on several occasions. During the spring of 2004, it doubled as Buckingham Palace for the filming of &quot;&quot;, starring Christian Slater and Neve Campbell. Pink gravel, guard houses and period vehicles were used to recreate the royal courtyard. The 1968 film &quot;Isadora&quot; starring Vanessa Redgrave and telling the life story of the dancer Isadora Duncan also used Oldway Mansion as one of its locations.
On 21 December 2005, the ballroom at Oldway Mansion was the location for Devon&#x27;s first civil partnership. The registration was officially witnessed by the Mayor of Torbay and his dignitaries.

<doc id="709548" wikidata="Q146661" url="?curid=709548" title="Redcurrant">
<text>The redcurrant or red currant (Ribes rubrum) is a member of the genus &quot;Ribes&quot; in the gooseberry family. It is native to western Europe. The species is widely cultivated and has escaped into the wild in many regions.

==Description==
&quot;Ribes rubrum&quot; is a deciduous shrub normally growing to tall, occasionally , with five-lobed leaves arranged spirally on the stems. The flowers are inconspicuous yellow-green, in pendulous racemes, maturing into bright red translucent edible berries about diameter, with 3–10 berries on each raceme. An established bush can produce of berries from mid- to late summer.

===Phytochemicals===
Redcurrant fruits are known for their tart flavor, a characteristic provided by a relatively high content of organic acids and mixed polyphenols. As many as 65 different phenolic compounds may contribute to the astringent properties of redcurrants, with these contents increasing during the last month of ripening. Twenty-five individual polyphenols and other nitrogen-containing phytochemicals in redcurrant juice have been isolated specifically with the astringent flavor profile sensed in the human tongue.

==Cultivation==
Several other similar species native in Europe, Asia and North America also have edible fruit. These include &quot;Ribes spicatum&quot; (northern Europe and northern Asia), &quot;Ribes alpinum&quot; (northern Europe, and at high altitudes south to the Alps, Pyrenees and Caucasus), &quot;R. schlechtendalii&quot; (northeast Europe), &quot;R. multiflorum&quot; (southeast Europe), &quot;R. petraeum&quot; (southwest Europe) and &quot;R. triste&quot; (North America; Newfoundland to Alaska and southward in mountains).

While &quot;Ribes rubrum&quot; is native to Europe, large berried cultivars of the redcurrant were first produced in Belgium and northern France in the 17th century. In modern times, numerous cultivars have been selected; some of these have escaped gardens and can be found in the wild across Europe and extending into Asia.

The white currant is also a cultivar of &quot;R. rubrum&quot;. Although it is a sweeter and less pigmented variant of the redcurrant, not a separate botanical species, it is sometimes marketed with names such as &quot;R. sativum&quot; or &quot;R. silvestre&quot;, or sold as a different fruit.

Currant bushes prefer partial to full sunlight and can grow in most types of soil. They are relatively low-maintenance plants and can also be used as ornamentation.

===Cultivars===
Many redcurrant and whitecurrant cultivars are available for domestic cultivation from specialist growers. The following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 
*&quot;Jonkheer van Tets&quot; 
*&quot;Red Lake&quot; 
*&quot;Stanza&quot; 
*&quot;White Grape&quot; (whitecurrant)

In a reference serving, redcurrants (or white) supply of food energy and are a rich source of vitamin C, providing 49% of the Daily Value (DV, table). Vitamin K is the only other essential nutrient in significant content at 10% of DV (table).

===Culinary===
With maturity, the tart flavour of redcurrant fruit is slightly greater than its blackcurrant relative, but with the same approximate sweetness. The white-fruited variant of redcurrant, often referred to as white currant, has the same tart flavour but with greater sweetness. Although frequently cultivated for jams and cooked preparations, much like the white currant, it is often served raw or as a simple accompaniment in salads, garnishes, or drinks when in season.

In the United Kingdom, redcurrant jelly is a condiment often served with lamb, game meat including venison, turkey and goose in a festive or Sunday roast. It is essentially a jam and is made in the same way, by adding the redcurrants to sugar, boiling, and straining.

In France, the highly rarefied and hand-made Bar-le-duc or &quot;Lorraine jelly&quot; is a spreadable preparation traditionally made from white currants or alternatively redcurrants. The pips are taken off by hand, originally by monks, with a goose feather, before cooking.

In Scandinavia and Schleswig-Holstein, it is often used in fruit soups and summer puddings (rødgrød, rote grütze or rode grütt). In Germany it is also used in combination with custard or meringue as a filling for tarts.

In Linz, Austria, it is the most commonly used filling for the Linzer torte. It can be enjoyed in its fresh state without the addition of sugar.

In German-speaking areas, syrup or nectar derived from the redcurrant is added to soda water and enjoyed as a refreshing drink named &quot;Johannisbeerschorle&quot;. It is so named because the redcurrants (&quot;Johannisbeeren&quot;, &quot;John&#x27;s berry&quot; in German) are said to ripen first on St. John&#x27;s Day, also known as Midsummer Day, June 24.

In Russia, redcurrants are ubiquitous and used in jams, preserves, compotes and desserts. It is also used to make kissel, a sweet dessert made from fresh berries or fruits (such as red currants, cherries, cranberries). The leaves have many uses in traditional medicine, such as making an infusion with black tea.

<doc id="709552" wikidata="Q1252873" url="?curid=709552" title="Eric Fingerhut">
<text>Eric David Fingerhut (born May 6, 1959) is an American politician, attorney, and academic administrator, serving as the President and CEO of The Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA). Prior to his appointment at JFNA, he served as president and CEO of Hillel International from 2013 to 2019. Earlier, he served as the corporate Vice President of Education and STEM Learning business at Battelle Memorial Institute, Chancellor of the Ohio Board of Regents, Ohio state senator and member of the United States House of Representatives for one term.

Fingerhut was appointed Chancellor of the Ohio Board of Regents on March 14, 2007 by Governor Ted Strickland. This position is a member of the Ohio Governor&#x27;s Cabinet. On February 22, 2011, he submitted his resignation to Gov. John Kasich, effective March 14, 2011, after serving four years of his five-year term. Chancellor Fingerhut earned a reputation as an innovative leader and ardent advocate of the value of higher education.

== Career ==
=== Support for Israel ===
While representing Ohio&#x27;s 19th congressional district in the 103rd Congress, Fingerhut was the co-sponsor of four bills in support of Israel. Including:

H.R. 1407 confronted a boycott of the State of Israel by aiming &quot;To prohibit government-to-government and commercial arms sales to any country that is participating in or cooperating with the boycott of Israel by Arab countries.&quot;H.R. 3656 unequivocally voiced its support for Israel seeking to &quot;restrict sales and leases of defense articles and defense services to any country or international organization which as a matter of policy or practice is known to have sent letters to United States firms requesting compliance with, or soliciting information regarding compliance with, the secondary or tertiary Arab boycott.&quot;

=== Tenure at Hillel International ===
Very quickly after beginning his tenure as CEO of Hillel International, the organization experienced a major controversy. The Hillel chapter at Swarthmore College declared itself an &quot;Open Hillel,&quot; choosing to welcome all guest speakers and student organizations, whether or not they support Zionism. Fingerhut responded, stating &quot;Let me be very clear – &quot;anti-Zionists&quot; will not be permitted to speak using the Hillel name or under the Hillel roof, under any circumstances.&quot; This controversy is widely seen as a key part of a broad conversation in the American Jewish community regarding whether or not Zionism is, or should be, a consensus issue.

Beginning in March 2015, Fingerhut was involved in a controversy with J Street U, the student arm of J Street. Fingerhut initially accepted an invitation to speak at the national student group meeting, but subsequently withdrew. Fingerhut then issued a statement saying he had withdrawn out of &quot;concerns regarding my participation amongst other speakers who have made highly inflammatory statements against the Jewish state.&quot; Several people involved in US Jewish student life noted that in an era when the number of Jewish students engaging with Jewish and Israel-related campus groups is shrinking, it might be unproductive to alienate the 3,000 participants in the J Street conference, a population that included 40 Hillel professionals, and that Hillel donor pressure was the likely cause of Fingerhut&#x27;s withdrawal. On March 23, 250 J Street students marched to Hillel headquarters, leaving letters for Fingerhut demanding a meeting with him and sharing their view that he caved to the demands of &quot;more conservative donors instead of engaging with the full range of student voices — including those on the more liberal end.&quot; Fingerhut then wrote to Benjy Cannon, the board president of J Street U and a senior at the University of Maryland, to arrange a meeting between the students and members of Hillel International’s board of directors. In his letter, Fingerhut said that there was &quot;work to do in the Jewish community at large to be one people that respects, honors and celebrates its diversity rather than fearing it. This incident taught me just how deep the divide is. I don’t yet have all the answers to how we will bridge this divide, but as Hillel’s president, I am committed to working with you to find them and I have no doubt we will be successful.&quot;

<doc id="709558" wikidata="Q586241" url="?curid=709558" title="Teton Range">
<text>The Teton Range is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in North America. It extends for approximately in a north–south direction through the U.S. state of Wyoming, east of the Idaho state line. It is south of Yellowstone National Park, and most of the east side of the range is within Grand Teton National Park.

One theory says the early French voyageurs named the range &#x27; (&quot;the three nipples&quot;) after the [[Breast-shaped hill|breast-like shapes]] of its peaks. Another theory says the range is named for the Teton Sioux (from Thítȟuŋwaŋ), also known as the [[Lakota people]]. It is likely that the local [[Shoshone people]] once called the whole range&#x27;, meaning &quot;many pinnacles&quot;.

The principal summits of the central massif, sometimes referred to as the Cathedral Group, are Grand Teton (), Mount Owen (), Teewinot (), Middle Teton () and South Teton (). Other peaks in the range include Mount Moran (), Mount Wister (), Buck Mountain () and Static Peak ().

==Geology==

Between six and nine million years ago, stretching and thinning of the Earth&#x27;s crust caused movement along the Teton fault. The west block along the fault line rose to form the Teton Range, creating the youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains. The fault&#x27;s east block fell to form the valley called Jackson Hole. The geological processes that led to the current composition of the oldest rocks in the Teton Range began about 2.5 billion years ago. At that time, sand and volcanic debris settled into an ancient ocean. Additional sediment was deposited for millions of years and eventually heat and pressure metamorphosed the sediment into gneiss. 

Subsequently, magma was forced up through the cracks in the gneiss to form granite, anywhere from inches to hundreds of feet thick. Other intrusive igneous rocks are noticeable as the black dikes of diabase, visible on the southwest face of Mount Moran and on the Grand Teton. Starting during the Cambrian period, deep deposits of sedimentary rock were deposited in shallow seas over the metamorphic basement rocks. Erosion and uplift have exposed the metamorphic and intrusive igneous rocks now visible on the east slope of the range and in the Cathedral Group and the Paleozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks on the west slope. As recently as 2.1 million years ago the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff was deposited along the west slope of the north part of the range.

One reason the Teton Range is famous is because of the dramatic elevation profile visible from the eastern side, which rises sharply from above the valley floor. Unlike most mountain ranges, the east side of the Teton Range lacks significant foothills or lower peaks which might obscure the view. This is due to the presence of the Teton Fault at the base of the east slope as well as the range being too young to have eroded into soft hills. The Snake River flows southward through the valley before turning to the west and entering Idaho.

==As a filming location==
The Tetons and Jackson Hole have been the setting for a number of films, including John Wayne&#x27;s film acting debut in &quot;The Big Trail&quot; in 1930 and the western film classic &quot;Shane&quot; in 1953. Mount Moran and the surrounding mountains were used as a backdrop for the lake/swamp setting in the original television series &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;. In addition, this mountain range is shown on the cover of rapper Kanye West&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Ye&quot;.

<text>Mary O. Boyle (born December 23, 1941) is an American politician who was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1979 to 1984. She was a member of the Ohio Democratic party.

Boyle started her career in elective office as a state legislator representing Cleveland Heights (Ohio District #9) in 1978. She was Elected Majority Whip in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1982. Following that, she served on the Board of County Commissioners of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, for twelve years. She was the first woman ever elected to a non-judicial county office in Cuyahoga County. She is married to the former Vice-President of Cleveland State, Jack Boyle.

Boyle was a candidate for the United States Senate in 1994, to replace the retiring Howard Metzenbaum, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Joel Hyatt. Republican Mike DeWine eventually was elected to the Senate seat in November 1994. In 1998, she was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate to replace the retiring John Glenn. She was defeated by then-Ohio Governor George Voinovich. She was the first (and still only) woman nominated by a major party for the Senate from Ohio. Boyle also ran for Treasurer of State in 2002 against Joseph T. Deters, which she lost.

Boyle is the mother of Ohio politician Jim Boyle and three other children: Catherine Boyle, John Boyle, and Peter Boyle.

<doc id="709586" wikidata="Q7152939" url="?curid=709586" title="Paul Pfeifer">
<text>Paul E. Pfeifer (born October 15, 1942) is an American politician and jurist. He served in both houses of the Ohio General Assembly as a member of the Ohio Republican party and was most recently an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.

==Background==
Pfeifer was born in Bucyrus in 1942. He grew up on his family&#x27;s dairy farm near Bucyrus. As a teenager, he raised purebred Yorkshire hogs to finance his college education. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in economics, political science, and history in 1963 from Ohio State University. In 1966, he also earned a law degree from the College of Law.

Pfeifer owns a cattle farm in Crawford County, near his childhood home. Pfeifer and his wife Julia have three children and four grandchildren.

From 1967 to 1970, he worked as an assistant attorney general under Ohio Attorney General William B. Saxbe. Pfeifer practiced law – tax and trial law – as a partner with the firm Cory, Brown &amp; Pfeifer from 1972 to 1992. From 1973 to 1976, he also served as an assistant to the Crawford County prosecutor.

==Political career==

===Ohio House of Representatives===
In 1970, Pfeifer was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. Pfeifer served as an Ohio state representative from 1971 to 1972. In 1976, he successfully ran for a seat in the Ohio Senate. Pfeifer was re-elected in 1980, 1984, and 1988. From 1983 to 1984, Pfeifer was minority floor leader and from 1985 to 1986, with a Republican majority in the Senate, Pfeifer became Assistant President Pro Tempore.

===Election bids===
In 1982, Pfeifer ran for the U.S. Senate, but was defeated by incumbent Democrat Howard Metzenbaum.

In 1990, Pfeifer ran for Ohio attorney general, losing to Democrat Lee Fisher by a narrow margin of just over 1,200 votes. Claiming that there were discrepancies between the total number of ballots cast and the number of signatures in the polling books, Pfeifer appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court to review the results, but the court refused.

=== Ohio Supreme Court justice ===
In 1992, Pfeifer was elected to the Ohio Supreme Court, defeating John T. Patton. In 1998, he was re-elected to the court, defeating Ronald Suster. Pfeifer was unopposed in his bid for re-election in 2004 and 2010. He retired January 1, 2017 when he was forced to leave the court after exceeding the age of 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges in Ohio. Pfeifer, as the longest serving associate Justice, became acting Chief Justice on April 2, 2010 upon the death of Chief Justice Thomas Moyer. Pfeifer remained in that capacity until May 3, 2010, when Franklin County Probate Court Judge Eric Brown, who was appointed Chief Justice by Governor Ted Strickland, took office.

Although nominally Republican, Pfeifer was often aligned with the Democratic minority on the Court.

<doc id="709616" wikidata="Q3115025" url="?curid=709616" title="Grande Ronde River">
<text>The Grande Ronde River ( or, less commonly, ) is a long tributary of the Snake River, flowing through northeast Oregon and southeast Washington in the United States. Its watershed is situated in the eastern Columbia Plateau, bounded by the Blue Mountains and Wallowa Mountains to the west of Hells Canyon. The river flows generally northeast from its forested headwaters west of La Grande, Oregon, through the agricultural Grande Ronde Valley in its middle course, and through rugged canyons cut from ancient basalt lava flows in its lower course. While it joins the Snake River upstream of Asotin, Washington, more than 90 percent of the river&#x27;s watershed is in Oregon.

The river was used for centuries by multiple Native American tribes, who fished, gathered and hunted across much of the watershed and convened in the Grande Ronde Valley for trade. European exploration began with the fur trade in the early 1800s; later, the Grande Ronde Valley provided a key resting point along the Oregon Trail. By the 1850s, the wave of settlement had spread to northeast Oregon, and the river was the scene of several conflicts, including the 1856 Grande Ronde massacre. Nearby gold discoveries drove emerging farming and logging industries in the Grande Ronde region, and by the 1880s most indigenous peoples had been forced away from the area and onto reservations, though several tribes maintain subsistence fishing rights along the river.

While the Grande Ronde and Wallowa Valleys developed into productive farming areas, further efforts to regulate and dam the river in the 20th century proved unsuccessful. Due to its free-flowing nature, the river provides a significant amount of spawning habitat for anadromous fish (salmon and steelhead) in the Columbia River system. These populations have declined due to the building of dams downstream on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, as well as habitat degradation in the Grande Ronde watershed. Despite efforts to protect and restore aquatic habitat, anadromous fish populations in the 21st century remain much lower than historical levels.

About of the Grande Ronde in Oregon are federally protected as a National Wild and Scenic River, in addition to parts of several tributaries including the Wallowa and Wenaha Rivers. Much of the Wild and Scenic section in Oregon, as well as the lowermost stretches of the river in Washington, can only be reached by water. The river&#x27;s undeveloped surroundings and abundant wildlife make it a popular location for sport fishing, hunting, wildlife viewing, and boating.

==Course==
The Grande Ronde&#x27;s source is an alpine meadow in southern Union County, Oregon, west of Anthony Lakes and the Anthony Lakes Ski Area, about above sea level. The headwaters are in the Elkhorn Mountains, a sub-range of the Blue Mountains. The river initially flows north through the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, turning east where Meadow Creek joins it from the left near Camp Elkanah. It then flows through Red Bridge and Hilgard Junction state parks, passing through a narrow canyon before entering the Grande Ronde Valley at the city of La Grande.

The Grande Ronde Valley, measuring about from north to south and up to from east to west, consists mostly of irrigated farmland and also includes the communities of Union, Cove, Imbler and Summerville. The river once flowed in a large U-shaped bend through the east side of the valley, but is now artificially diverted to the north via the State Ditch, bypassing the long meandering section to the east. At the end of the ditch the original channel – which now carries water from Catherine Creek– rejoins from the right. At the northern end of the valley, the Grande Ronde flows through Rhinehart Gap into the smaller Indian Valley and the city of Elgin, where it receives Clark Creek from the right and Phillips Creek from the left.
Below Elgin, the Grande Ronde enters a series of deep, winding canyons for the remaining of its course to the Snake River. It receives Lookingglass Creek from the left then crosses into Wallowa County at Rondowa, where it is joined from the right by its largest tributary, the Wallowa River. Entering the Umatilla National Forest, it turns east, receiving Bear and Elbow Creeks from the left and Wildcat, Mud and Courtney Creeks from the right, then the Wenaha River from the left at the settlement of Troy. From Troy, the terrain around the river becomes more open, with forests giving way to grassy ridges and rangeland. The stretch between the Wallowa River confluence and Wildcat Creek is inaccessible by road.

The Grande Ronde flows northeast, entering Asotin County, Washington at Horseshoe Bend, where it crosses the state border three times (into Washington, back into Oregon and into Washington again). It receives Menatchee and Cottonwood Creeks from the left, then is crossed by State Route 129 on the Grande Ronde River Bridge at Boggan&#x27;s Oasis southwest of Anatone. Below here, the river cuts through progressively more arid, sparsely vegetated landscapes with large areas of exposed rock. It is joined by Joseph Creek from the right before emptying into the Snake River at the unincorporated community of Rogersburg, upstream of Asotin, Washington and upstream of the Snake&#x27;s confluence with the Columbia River.

===Discharge===
By discharge, the Grande Ronde is the third largest tributary of the Snake River. Although water is diverted off the upper river for irrigation, water consumption in the Grande Ronde Valley represents only about 9 percent of its flow at the mouth, and with no large dams regulating its flow, the Grande Ronde runs high with spring snowmelt and reaches its lowest level in the fall. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has only one operational stream gage on the Grande Ronde, located downstream of the Wenaha confluence near Troy. The station measures runoff from an area of , or about 80 percent of the entire watershed. The mean annual discharge between 1944 and 2023 was , with a record high of on February 9, 1996, and a low of on August 20, 1977. Mean monthly discharge ranged from a high of in May to a low of in September.

The USGS also measured stream flow at several other locations along the river. At La Grande, just before the river enters the Grande Ronde Valley, the average discharge was for the period 1903–1989. This was from a drainage area of , or 16 percent of the entire Grande Ronde watershed. At Elgin, the average discharge was for the period 1955–1981, from a drainage area of , or 30 percent of the entire watershed.

==Watershed==
The Grande Ronde River&#x27;s watershed is located mostly in Union and Wallowa Counties in Oregon and Asotin County in Washington, with small parts extending into Umatilla County, Oregon and Columbia and Garfield counties in Washington. The Blue Mountains, mostly rising to about , form the western boundary of the watershed as they extend through northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. East of the Grande Ronde Valley are the Wallowa Mountains, whose highest peaks reach almost . Due to their higher elevation, the Wallowas were shaped by heavy Ice Age glaciation, leading to their nickname of the &quot;Oregon Alps&quot;. The Wallowa Valley, the second major mountain valley in the Grande Ronde watershed, is situated just north of the Wallowa Mountains; the Wallowa River drains this area into the Grande Ronde. The northeastern part of the Grande Ronde watershed, north of the Wallowa Valley and west of Hells Canyon, is defined by extensive flat-topped plateaus through which the river and its tributaries have cut canyons, creating a dissected plateau.
Most of the river&#x27;s watershed is in Oregon; only , or 8 percent, are in Washington. The U.S. Geological Survey considers the Upper Grande Ronde sub-basin to be the section upstream of the Wallowa River, with the Lower Grande Ronde sub-basin extending from there to the Snake River. The Upper Grande Ronde is , or about 40 percent of the total; the Lower Grande Ronde is , or about 37 percent. The Wallowa River sub-basin accounts for the remaining , or 23 percent of the whole.

The watershed is mostly rangeland and forest, with agriculture limited to the Grande Ronde and Wallowa Valleys. Population density is light at about 16.6 persons per square mile (6.4/km2). The largest city is La Grande, which as of the 2020 census had a population of 13,026. Other major towns include Union (2,152) in the southern Grande Ronde Valley, and Enterprise (2,052) in the Wallowa Valley. About 46 percent of the watershed is public land, managed primarily by the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Most of the Wallowa Mountains, and the Grande Ronde&#x27;s headwaters in the Elkhorn Mountains, are in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The Blue Mountains to the north are mostly in the Umatilla National Forest.

The Grande Ronde watershed experiences a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moderately snowy winters. Mean temperatures range from a daily minimum in January to a daily maximum of in July. Annual precipitation ranges from in the valleys to at higher elevations. Most precipitation in the Grande Ronde watershed falls as snow. Due to the lower elevation of the Blue Mountains, snowmelt occurs earlier in the upper Grande Ronde drainage, typically peaking in March or April; the Wallowa River, by contrast, peaks in May or June.

The Grande Ronde watershed is bordered by several other watersheds of the Columbia River basin. To the west are the watersheds of the Walla Walla, Umatilla and John Day Rivers, which all flow directly into the Columbia River. The Tucannon River and Asotin Creek to the north, the Imnaha River to the east, and the Powder River to the south are all tributaries of the Snake River.

==Geology==

The Grande Ronde River basin is founded on multiple terranes, or crustal fragments, that accreted onto the North American continent during the Mesozoic 248–65 million years ago (Ma). At that time, the area was still part of a shallow inland sea. About 160–100 Ma, multiple igneous plutons intruded into the crust beneath this area, the largest of which would eventually form the Wallowa Mountains as the region experienced tectonic uplift that raised the land above sea level. The general outline of the Columbia River basin and its tributaries began to take shape about 40 Ma.

The ancestral topography and drainage patterns were completely altered between 17–6 Ma with the eruption of the Columbia River basalts, a series of massive flood basalt events that engulfed much of eastern Washington and Oregon in the region now known as the Columbia Plateau. In parts of the Grande Ronde River basin, the basalt layers are more than thick. The Grande Ronde basalt sub-group erupted between 17 and 15.5 Ma and accounts for more than 80 percent of the total volume of the flows.

The outline of the Grande Ronde watershed began to take shape about 14 Ma, as tectonic uplift combined with the effects of basalt eruptions blocked westward drainage from the region to form a large geologic depression, the &quot;Troy basin&quot;. A landscape of shallow lakes and peat bogs developed; over millions of years, layers of peat were buried under sediment, forming lignite (low-grade coal) seams which appear in the Grouse Creek area near Troy. By 10 Ma the area had begun to drain northeast down an ancestral Grande Ronde river channel. Some of the later basalt eruptions flowed down this channel and spread over southeastern Washington. At this time, the land was still relatively flat and the river formed a meandering course through the developing soils atop the basalt layers.

From the end of the basalt eruptions around 6 Ma, the rate of uplift greatly increased as the present-day Blue Mountains began to rise. As the land rose, the river&#x27;s gradient increased and it began to incise into the landscape, entrenching its meanders and resulting in the river&#x27;s twisting course through its lower canyons. Along the lower Grande Ronde, the canyons have cut through and exposed the horizontal basalt layers, forming distinctive terraced cliffs. Although the Columbia River basalts encompass almost all the surface geology of the area, older rocks are exposed in a few places, including the Wallowa and Elkhorn mountains, and along the lower river in Washington where it cuts into rock below the basalt layers. In contrast, the Grande Ronde Valley was formed as a large graben, or fault-block, dropped below rising mountains on either side. Alluvial sediment deposits, up to thick in places, form the flat valley floor.

==History==
===Indigenous peoples===
The lower Grande Ronde watershed downstream of the Grande Ronde Valley was once within the territory of the Nez Perce. The higher elevations in the Blue Mountains to the west were used by the Nez Perce and multiple Columbia Plateau tribes, who traveled to these areas in summer to hunt, fish and gather roots and berries. The Grande Ronde headwaters above the valley were considered Cayuse territory. The Grande Ronde Valley itself was a major rendezvous site for the Nez Perce and tribes west of the Blue Mountains such as the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla. The Shoshone from the south would also visit the area. The valley was a place to trade and peacefully settle disputes, as well as to fish, bathe in hot springs, and bring the elderly and sick to recuperate.

People came to the Grande Ronde region via an extensive network of trails that laced the Blue Mountains. Trails connected the Grande Ronde Valley southeast to the Baker Valley, west to the Umatilla River valley, and north to the Walla Walla Valley. A major trail used by the Nez Perce ran from their villages at the Snake and Clearwater River confluence (modern-day Lewiston) up Asotin Creek and down to the Grande Ronde near the Wenaha River. From there it followed the Grande Ronde to Indian Valley where a branch crossed east towards the Wallowa Valley. The Wallowa Valley was a favorite hunting ground for the Wallowa band of Nez Perce, which in the 1870s was led by Chief Joseph. The Wallowa migrated seasonally on this route from winter villages on the lower Grande Ronde and Snake, gathering roots on high prairies in spring, and hunting and fishing in the Wallowa Valley in late summer and fall.

The Nez Perce and Cayuse called the upper section of the Grande Ronde &quot;Qapqápnim Wéele&quot;, meaning &quot;cottonwood stream&quot;. The joining of this stream with the &quot;Wall-low-how&quot; or Wallowa River formed the &quot;Way-lee-way&quot;, or the lower section of what is now the Grande Ronde. An important fishing village, Qapqápa, was located at present-day La Grande. Upstream of there, the river was known as ʔIyéexeteš, &quot;foaling area&quot;, by the Cayuse. The Cayuse and Walla Walla had a fishing village on the Grande Ronde called ʔUnéhe, near Courtney Creek upstream of the mouth of the Wenaha River. The Nez Perce had several villages on the Grande Ronde below the Wenaha, including Híinezpu at the mouth of Bear Creek, and Qemúynem at the confluence with the Snake River.

A Nez Perce legend tells that the course of the lower Grande Ronde was created by Beaver, after he stole fire from the pine trees in the Blue Mountains to bring to the other animals so they could warm themselves.

===Exploration and settlement===
The Grande Ronde Valley was explored and named by fur trappers in the early 19th century. In 1811 the Pacific Fur Company chartered an expedition, led by Wilson Price Hunt, to find a passage from the upper Snake River to the Pacific Ocean. Finding Hells Canyon to be impassable for boats, the expedition followed Native American trails on an overland route through the Blue Mountains. Starving and exhausted, they stumbled across the Grande Ronde Valley on Christmas Day, and replenished their supplies by trading with the natives. French-Canadian fur trappers who subsequently visited the area dubbed it &quot;Grande Ronde&quot;, meaning &quot;great circle&quot;, a name which was recorded by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. Ogden also referred to the river as the &quot;Clay River&quot;, the origin of which is not known.

U.S. Army officer Benjamin Bonneville explored the lower Grande Ronde River on an 1834 expedition, after also failing to find a way down the Snake through Hells Canyon. Bonneville&#x27;s party crossed the Wallowa Mountains and down Joseph Canyon to reach the Grande Ronde, recording the name &quot;Way-lee-way&quot;. At the confluence they encountered the winter camp of Chief Tuekakas and the Wallowa Nez Perce. Bonneville also called the river &quot;Fourche de Glace&quot;, &quot;river of ice&quot;. In 1843, John C. Frémont surveyed the Grande Ronde Valley for the Corps of Topographical Engineers. Emphasizing the agricultural potential of the valley, he described it thus:

Starting in the 1840s, settlers began to move through the area on the Oregon Trail, which passed through northeast Oregon roughly following the route of the Hunt expedition. From Idaho, the trail traveled up the Burnt River and through Baker Valley before entering the Grande Ronde Valley via Ladd Canyon. Passing through La Grande, it crossed the Grande Ronde River upstream at what is now Hilgard Junction State Park, before diverging northwest along what is now the I-84 route towards present-day Pendleton. Moses &quot;Black&quot; Harris led the first wagon train through the Grande Ronde Valley in 1844.

The fertile, well-watered valley, with its grasslands offering rich forage for animals, was a welcome respite after traveling through the deserts of eastern Oregon and Idaho. Native Americans in the valley engaged in a lucrative trade of oxen, trading one healthy, well-fed animal for every two exhausted, starving ones. They let the oxen graze and fatten up in the valley before selling them to the next party of travelers. An estimated 300,000 emigrants traveled through the Grande Ronde Valley from the 1840s to the 1870s.

As the wave of settlement spread to northeast Oregon, the 1850s saw increasing hostilities between Native Americans and settlers, particularly after the 1847 Whitman Massacre. The Walla Walla, Cayuse and Umatilla surrendered their lands in the upper Grande Ronde River in the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla in exchange for the Umatilla Indian Reservation, although they &quot;reserved their right to hunt, fish and gather at all usual and accustomed areas on and off the reservation.&quot; On July 17, 1856, a U.S. Army detachment led by Col. Benjamin F. Shaw killed fifty or sixty mostly unarmed Walla Walla, Umatilla and Cayuse near present-day Elgin, in what is now known as the Grande Ronde Massacre. This further inflamed tensions and led to the failure of peace talks in 1856. In 1862, settlers began homesteading in the Grande Ronde Valley and a group of Umatilla attempted to prevent them from claiming land. Soldiers sent to deal with the dispute ended up killing four Umatilla men, causing the rest of the group to flee. This brought an end to tribal resistance of settlement in the valley.

The Nez Perce retained control of their lands along the lower Grande Ronde River in the 1855 treaty. However, gold strikes near Lewiston led to a flood of prospectors onto Nez Perce treaty lands in the 1860s. Some Nez Perce leaders were pressured into signing a second treaty that greatly shrank the size of their reservation, eliminating all the lands in Washington and Oregon, and thus the Grande Ronde watershed, from their use. Several Nez Perce bands, including that led by Chief Joseph, refused to leave their lands in northeast Oregon. Joseph&#x27;s band held out in the Wallowa Valley until the Nez Perce War of 1877, when they were forced to flee ahead of the US Army&#x27;s arrival.

===Later development===

The Grande Ronde Valley became well established as an agricultural center in the 1860s and 1870s, providing food to gold mining districts in Idaho to the east. La Grande, founded in 1862, was the first permanent American settlement in northeast Oregon. Within a few years, farmers and ranchers had dug ditches, rerouted and channelized streams to drain the area&#x27;s natural wetlands. Timber cut in the surrounding mountains was floated down the Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek to sawmills in the valley. Gold was also discovered in Tanner Gulch near the river&#x27;s headwaters in 1862, and from the 1870s to the early 1900s the area hosted placer mining operations. The community of Hilgard developed on the old Oregon Trail about west of La Grande, as a supply point for miners, ranchers and loggers.

In 1884 the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&amp;N) built its tracks through the valley, connecting the area to Portland by rail. By 1890 the OR&amp;N had constructed a branch line to Elgin; in 1907 it was extended to Joseph in the Wallowa Valley. The rail line follows the winding Grande Ronde River canyon from Elgin to Rondowa, where it turns east up the Wallowa River canyon. It was primarily used to haul wood, grain and livestock and had a regular passenger service until 1960. The Wallowa Union Railroad Authority now operates the line; since 2004 it has hosted a heritage rail service, the Eagle Cap Excursion Train, between Elgin and Joseph.

During the 1860s, gold prospecting from Lewiston soon extended up the Snake to the Grande Ronde&#x27;s mouth, following rumors of a massive gold discovery on Shovel Creek, which flows into the Snake a short distance upstream from the Grande Ronde. By 1865 the Rogers brothers had established Rogersburg at the confluence of the Grande Ronde and Snake. Although the Rogers laid out the townsite with plans to sell lots, the town failed to grow because of the lack of road access. Steamboats on the Snake River were the primary means of transportation between Lewiston, the mouth of the Grande Ronde and points upstream. Mining traffic ceased in 1904, though boats started carrying passengers and mail again around 1910. The mouth of the Grande Ronde remained inaccessible by road until 1937.

The rugged, relatively inaccessible area around Troy was not settled until near the turn of the 20th century. William Adams and his wife Lou homesteaded near the Grande Ronde in 1893; their isolation in the wilderness prompted comparisons to Adam and Eve, and the well-timbered plateau between the Grande Ronde and Wenaha became known as &quot;Eden Ridge&quot;. Over the next few years more settlers arrived, and the first building in Troy was established in 1902. By 1904, a rough road had been constructed from Elgin to Eden. The route through mountainous terrain was &quot;a huge job for the small number of settlers&quot;.

With most of this land unsuitable for agriculture, the primary industry became livestock grazing. By the time the Wenaha Forest Reserve (now the Wenaha Ranger District of the Umatilla National Forest) was established in 1905, about 200,000 sheep, 40,000 cattle and 15,000 horses grazed in the area. The forest reserve was established in order to settle land disputes between cattle and sheep ranchers, and to protect the watershed from overgrazing. The canyons of the lower Grande Ronde were used for wintering livestock as well as growing fruits and vegetables. By the 1930s, many of the original homesteaders had sold out, and ranches consolidated into fewer, larger operations. Although livestock is still one of the region&#x27;s main industries, some parts of the Grande Ronde watershed have since been closed to grazing. In what would become the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness, grazing allotments were cancelled around 1965.

A number of dams were proposed for the Grande Ronde throughout the 20th century, though none were built. In 1944 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation proposed several dams on the upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek in response to repeated flooding in the Grande Ronde Valley. Congress authorized the flood control dams in 1968, but they were delayed due to environmental concerns. After the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation sued in 1974, the dam projects were &quot;indefinitely postponed&quot;. Downstream of Troy, the Wenaha Dam was proposed in 1963 for flood control and power generation. This high rockfill dam would have backed water more than up the Grande Ronde River. On October 28, 1988, the Grande Ronde was designated a Wild and Scenic River from the Wallowa River to near the Oregon–Washington border, making the section off limits to new dams.

==Ecology==
===Fish===

The Grande Ronde River supports an estimated 38 fish species, of which 15 are introduced. Like many rivers in the Columbia Basin, it once supported large runs of anadromous fish, which migrate from the Pacific to spawn in freshwater streams. These fish formed a major part of the diet for indigenous peoples in the region. Chinook salmon, steelhead and bull trout are federally listed as threatened species; their numbers have fallen due to dam construction along the Columbia and Snake Rivers and habitat degradation in the Grande Ronde river system. Sockeye salmon, which primarily spawned in Wallowa Lake, have been extirpated from the basin since the early 1900s, though Kokanee (landlocked sockeye) are still present in Wallowa Lake. The Grande Ronde was once the largest producer of coho salmon in the Snake River system, but the wild coho run had also disappeared by 1986. Hatchery coho were reintroduced to the Grande Ronde watershed in 2017. Hatchery coho returns rebounded enough to permit coho retention in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

The Grande Ronde River watershed has between of current or former salmon-bearing streams. Historically, twenty-one tributaries of the Grande Ronde supported salmon spawning, but by 1995, only eight tributaries did so. Before the turn of the 20th century, an estimated 20,000 spring chinook salmon spawned in the river, which had declined to 12,200 by 1957 and to just over 1,000 in 1992. Steelhead returns fell from about 16,000 in the 1960s to 11,000 in the 1990s. Water quality in the Grande Ronde basin has been impacted by logging, livestock grazing and agriculture, which have led to increased sedimentation rates and stream temperatures, and reduced water flows in late summer. In 1982 the Lookingglass Fish Hatchery was built to rear chinook salmon on Lookingglass Creek, a tributary of the Grande Ronde. The hatchery was one of several built throughout the Snake River system as part of the Lower Snake River Compensation Plan, to mitigate anadromous fish losses caused by dam projects.

In 1992, the Northwest Power Planning Council organized the Grande Ronde Model Watershed (GRMW) project to develop a comprehensive management strategy for the Grande Ronde and adjacent Imnaha River watersheds. The GRMW is intended to foster cooperation between public agencies, private landowners, fisheries management and environmental interests. Funded primarily by the Bonneville Power Administration, it has coordinated hundreds of projects in the Grande Ronde River basin to conserve instream flows, remove fish passage barriers, mitigate erosion and restore riparian habitats. However, chinook salmon and steelhead returns have not increased substantially in the 1992–2023 period, due to the effects of the Snake and Columbia River dams on fish migration.

Bull trout, once widely distributed in Oregon, now inhabit only a few streams due to the effects of logging, mining and agriculture. The Grande Ronde, Wenaha, and Wallowa Rivers and their tributaries host eleven surviving bull trout populations. Redband trout and Pacific lamprey are federally designated species of concern. Other native and introduced fish species in the Grande Ronde watershed include mountain whitefish, brook trout, northern pikeminnow, peamouth chub, longnose dace, speckled dace, redside shiner, largescale sucker, bridgelip sucker and mountain sucker.

===Plants and animals===
The Grande Ronde watershed occupies the eastern part of the Blue Mountains ecoregion, which is home to about 13 amphibian species, 285 bird species, 92 mammal species, and 21 reptile species. Rocky Mountain elk were widespread in the region for thousands of years, but their populations were almost eliminated by the 1880s due to hunting and habitat encroachment. Elk were reintroduced in the early 1900s. As of 2020, the Blue Mountains elk herd which ranges in the northern part of the Grande Ronde and Wenaha drainages numbered just over 4,000 head. Much of the Grande Ronde is also located within gray wolf range in Oregon. Union and Wallowa Counties each have eight known wolf packs. The range of four wolf packs in Washington also extends into or adjacent to the Grande Ronde watershed. The river bottoms also provide wintering habitat for bighorn sheep, elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer and bald eagles.

Grasslands dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass, sheep fescue and giant wildrye were once widespread across the watershed. Most of the original grasslands have been replaced by agriculture or heavily altered by livestock grazing, which has caused erosion and introduced invasive plants such as cheatgrass. The Grande Ronde watershed includes part of the Zumwalt Prairie, the largest intact bunchgrass prairie in the Pacific Northwest. Higher elevations transition into shrubland and eventually coniferous forest in the Blue and Wallowa Mountains. As elevation increases, principal tree species transition from ponderosa pine to Douglas-fir, grand fir, subalpine fir and mountain hemlock.

The Grande Ronde Valley was once home to extensive wetlands. The perennial Tule Lake was located in the southern part of the valley, where the Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek converged to form the most significant area of wetlands. The lake fluctuated from in size, expanding to more than in especially wet years. Beaver were widespread, and their ponds were a major factor in forming wetlands, creating a diversity of water depths and vegetation communities that provided shade and food sources for salmon and other fish. Robert Stuart, a member of Hunt&#x27;s 1811 expedition, described the wetlands as such:


Fur trappers eradicated beaver from the area and settlers drained most of the wetlands for agriculture in the 19th century. The State Ditch diverted the Grande Ronde River away from this flood-prone lowland area, leaving Catherine and Ladd Creeks as the only surface water inflows. In 1949, Ladd Marsh Wildlife Area was established in the southern part of the valley to conserve wetland habitat for migrating waterfowl. This is now the largest tule wetland remaining in northeast Oregon.

==Industries and economy==
Irrigation is the largest consumer of Grande Ronde River water. The Grande Ronde Valley has about of irrigated farmland, consuming of surface water and of groundwater each year. Municipal and industrial users consume about of combined surface and groundwater. Some of this water re-enters the river via irrigation return flows. There are eighteen small reservoirs in the upper Grande Ronde basin upstream of the Wallowa River, most of which store water for irrigation or recreation purposes. None of these reservoirs are on the main stem of the river, and their impact on the river&#x27;s overall flow is negligible. As a consequence, irrigators mostly depend on the natural availability of water, which can vary significantly from year to year. Another of surface water are used for irrigation in the Wallowa Valley. A dam regulates the level of Wallowa Lake to store up to ; this is the largest surface water storage facility in the Grande Ronde River system.
While water flows in the Upper Grande Ronde River Basin typically peak in March and April, agricultural water demand is highest in June and July. On average, the valley experiences an annual water supply deficit between about June and November. In late summers of dry years, irrigation diversions often leave very little water to flow out of the Grande Ronde Valley. Water deficits are most severe in the southern part of the valley, in the Catherine Creek sub-basin. On the other hand, spring snowmelt presents a high flood risk, due to the area&#x27;s naturally flat topography and the redevelopment of wetlands and floodplains that once buffered high flows. As of 2022, the state of Oregon was funding plans for off-stream reservoirs, groundwater recharge, water conservation and floodplain restoration in order to mitigate spring flooding and summer water shortages in the Grande Ronde Valley.

Logging has been a major industry in the Grande Ronde watershed since settlement in the 1860s. A water-powered sawmill was first built on the river in 1862 at Oro Dell, just upstream of La Grande. By 1890, the Grande Ronde Lumber Company had acquired large tracts of timberland in the upper Grande Ronde watershed. Several splash dams were constructed to store water for annual log drives down the river. Around the turn of the 20th century, about 10–20 million board feet of logs were floated down the river each year to mills in La Grande. In 1926, the Mount Emily Lumber Company acquired the Grande Ronde Lumber Company&#x27;s holdings. The river drives ended, with log hauls switching to rail, and later to truck.

In the mid-20th century, logging on federal (National Forest) lands increased greatly in both Union and Wallowa Counties, but the rate of harvest dropped off by the 1990s, with private industry making up the bulk of timber harvest in the 21st century. In 2004, about 118 million board feet were cut in Union and Wallowa Counties, compared to 200–300 million board feet per year in the 1960s–1980s. Although the river is no longer used for log transport, the effects of timber harvest continue to impact its tributaries. In many places, reduced forest canopy cover has elevated stream temperatures, to the detriment of cold-water fish such as trout and salmon. Since the 1970s, improved logging practices such as stream buffer zones have reduced the impact of timber harvest on the Grande Ronde.

Early gold mining along the river&#x27;s headwaters was followed by dredge mining in the 1930s and 1940s that deposited tailings along more than of the riverbed. The tailings buried the natural floodplain and forced the river into a constricted channel on the west side of the valley. Starting about 2010, the Forest Service has conducted restoration work along this reach.

==Recreation==

Several sections of the Grande Ronde and its tributaries are federally protected as National Wild and Scenic Rivers. The Wild and Scenic section of the Grande Ronde extends for from Rondowa, at the confluence of the Wallowa River, to the Oregon–Washington state line. The roadless stretch from Rondowa to Wildcat Creek is designated &quot;Wild&quot;, and from there downstream is &quot;Recreational&quot;. The Wallowa River is designated &quot;Recreational&quot; for from Minam to its confluence with the Grande Ronde. The entire main stem of the Wenaha River is protected, with the section in the Umatilla National Forest designated &quot;Wild&quot;, and from there to Troy as &quot;Scenic&quot; and &quot;Recreational&quot;. Parts of three other streams in the Grande Ronde watershed – the Minam River, Lostine River and Joseph Creek – also carry Wild and Scenic designations.

The Grande Ronde River is considered one of the top recreational fisheries in the Pacific Northwest, particularly for steelhead/rainbow trout and chinook salmon. Steelhead fishing is typically best from September or October to early December, when water temperatures fall low enough to draw steelhead out of the Snake River. Only hatchery fish with clipped adipose fins may be kept. Fly fishing for trout is good along the Wild and Scenic stretch in Oregon. Smallmouth bass are common in the lower river in Washington. The Grande Ronde&#x27;s tributary, the Wenaha River, is one of only a few Oregon rivers where fishing for bull trout is permitted (catch-and-release only). Because the 1855 Treaty of Walla Walla grants rights to Umatilla and Nez Perce subsistence fishing in the Grande Ronde River, the allowable harvest of fall chinook is apportioned evenly between the sport and subsistence fisheries.

Along the Oregon–Washington border, the river is accessible by road from Powwatka Bridge (Wildcat Creek) upstream from Troy, to Shumaker Creek about downstream from Boggan&#x27;s Oasis. The mouth of the river is also reachable by road from Asotin. While the Wild section of the Grande Ronde is entirely on the Umatilla National Forest, the Recreational section passes through a mix of public and private lands. Several public access points are maintained along this stretch. From this reach upstream to the Wallowa River confluence and down to the Snake River, the Grande Ronde is accessible only by boat. Fishing is often done from drift boats and rafts, and several private outfitters run multi-day floating trips on the river. 
Due to its abundant wildlife, the Grande Ronde area is frequented by hunters. Big game hunting for elk, deer, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, black bear and mountain lion draws about 40,000 people each year to the Umatilla National Forest. chukar, partridge and quail are common in riverside and grassland areas, and turkey and grouse are common in the upland forested areas. Due to the lack of roads, many hunters use boats on the river to access remote areas. Bird hunting locations near the river include the Wenaha Wildlife Area around Troy, and parts of Ladd Marsh in the Grande Ronde Valley.

The Grande Ronde has mostly beginner to intermediate level whitewater (class II-III), and is heavily used by rafters and kayakers. The Wallowa River at Minam is the main launching point for the Wild and Scenic section of the river. It usually takes 2–3 days to float the Wild and Scenic stretch from Minam to the Oregon–Washington border. There are no maintained camping facilities along most of the river. Primitive campsites on the river are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Boaters can also access the river at Powwatka Bridge, Mud Creek, Troy, Boggan&#x27;s Oasis and Shumaker Creek. Many boaters from Minam take out at Powwatka Bridge or Troy, while another popular shorter float is from Troy down to Boggan&#x27;s Oasis or Shumaker Creek. From Shumaker down to the mouth, there is no direct return by road.

Because the river is free-flowing, water levels can rise or fall quickly depending on precipitation and snowmelt. The most popular boating season is from about May to July. Before May, the river is typically running too high with spring melt, and by August water levels have fallen enough to expose numerous rocks and shoals. The Narrows, located about from the confluence with the Snake, is the only Class IV rapid on the Grande Ronde and is considered quite dangerous, especially at low water during which the river constricts into a small bedrock chute. All river trips require registering for a free permit from the Bureau of Land Management, which administers watercraft use of the river.

<text>Axel Stordahl (August 8, 1913 – August 30, 1963) was an American arranger and composer who was active from the late 1930s through the 1950s. He is perhaps best known for his work with Frank Sinatra in the 1940s at Columbia Records. With his sophisticated orchestrations, Stordahl is credited with helping to bring pop arranging into the modern age.

==Early years==
Stordahl was born in Staten Island, New York, United States, to Norwegian immigrant parents. He began his career as a trumpeter in jazz bands that played around Long Island and the Catskills during the late 1920s and early 1930s. He also began arranging around this time, and in 1933 he joined Anthony Fanzo&#x27;s orchestra in both capacities. Over the next couple of years, Stordahl sang on the side in a vocal trio dubbed the Three Esquires.

==Big bands==
In 1936, he joined Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s new orchestra and soon became the band&#x27;s main arranger. The same year appeared their first big hit, &quot;I&#x27;m Getting Sentimental Over You&quot;. The tune quickly became Dorsey&#x27;s theme song. In January 1940, Frank Sinatra joined the group as vocalist, and it became apparent that Stordahl&#x27;s arrangements were particularly well suited to the singer&#x27;s voice.

==Stordahl and Sinatra==
In January 1942, when Sinatra convinced Dorsey to let him record four songs without Dorsey, Stordahl arranged Sinatra&#x27;s very first commercial solo recordings for the RCA Victor subsidiary label Bluebird, and when Sinatra left Dorsey later that year to go solo, Stordahl went with him and became his music director. In the subsequent decade, Sinatra cut around three hundred sides for Columbia Records, of which three quarters were arranged by Stordahl. In addition, Stordahl provided the orchestral backings, both as arranger and conductor, for several hundreds of songs in various Sinatra radio programs. He was the credited orchestrator for the 1945 Academy Award-winning picture &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; which starred Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. His most successful songs of that time were the likes of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Know,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Is the Loneliest Night of the Week,&quot; &quot;They Say It&#x27;s Wonderful,&quot; and &quot;Mam&#x27;selle.&quot; In 1946 they recorded the album &quot;The Voice&quot; which was the first album with 8 ballads. His other songs as a composer such as &quot;I Should Care&quot; (1945), &quot;Day by Day&quot; (1946), and &quot;Night after Night&quot; (1949) were written with Paul Weston and Sammy Cahn.

Stordahl was admired for his skills in framing Sinatra&#x27;s voice, creating a soft, opulent sound with swirling strings, understated rhythms and woodwinds. He was one of the first American arrangers to tailor his accompaniments to the vocal qualities of a specific singer. When Sinatra moved to Capitol Records in 1953, Stordahl arranged his first recording session there. Afterwards, however, Sinatra worked extensively with Nelson Riddle, who cultivated his jazz-oriented qualities, as well as Gordon Jenkins, Billy May, Don Costa, Neal Hefti, Quincy Jones, and others.

Stordahl went on to work with other singers such as Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, Dinah Shore, Nat &#x27;King&#x27; Cole and Dean Martin, among others. Although best known as an arranger, Stordahl also composed a number of songs of which &quot;Day by Day&quot; with music by Axel Stordahl and Paul Weston and lyrics by Sammy Cahn, is the best known.

In 1961, Sinatra returned to collaborate with an ailing Stordahl for his final Capitol concept album, &quot;Point of No Return&quot;.

==Television and radio==
Stordahl worked with Eddie Fisher&#x27;s television program for four years and composed and orchestrated the theme to the popular television comedy series &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;.

In 1953, Fisher was signed to do a twice-weekly 15-minute program on NBC television with Coca-Cola as sponsor. Audio of the program was recorded and broadcast on a delayed basis on NBC&#x27;s radio network.

In addition to his work as conductor on Sinatra&#x27;s radio program, Stordahl conducted the orchestra on Eddie Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Coke Time&quot; show and worked on the radio version of &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;.

==Recording==
In addition to providing orchestral accompaniment for recordings of well-known vocalists, Stordahl also conducted orchestras for instrumental-music albums, such as &quot;Dreamtime: The Strings of Stordahl&quot; (1953), &quot;Jasmine &amp; Jade&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Magic Islands Revisited&quot; (1961).

==Personal life and honours==
Stordahl married singer June Hutton (of the Pied Pipers) in 1951. They made some joint recordings for Capitol records.

In 1967, the Los Angeles chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences established a scholarship in Stordahl&#x27;s memory at the University of California, Los Angeles. Only graduate students were eligible for the $300 scholarship through the music department.

Stordahl died August 30, 1963, at the age of 50 of cancer in Encino, California. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<text>Mac OS Roman is a character encoding created by Apple Computer, Inc. for use by Macintosh computers. It is suitable for representing text in English and several other languages that use the Latin script. Mac OS Roman encodes 256 characters, the first 128 of which are identical to ASCII, with the remaining characters including mathematical symbols, diacritics, and additional punctuation marks. Mac OS Roman is an extension of the original Macintosh character set, which encoded 217 characters. Full support for Mac OS Roman first appeared in System 6.0.4, released in 1989, and the encoding is still supported in current versions of macOS, though the standard character encoding is now UTF-8. Apple modified Mac OS Roman in 1998 with the release of Mac OS 8.5 by replacing the currency sign with the euro sign, but otherwise the encoding has been unchanged since its release.

== Character set ==

The following table shows how characters are encoded in Mac OS Roman. The row and column headings give the first and second digit of the hexadecimal code for each character in the table.

<text>Rhine Lana McLin (born October 1948) is an American Democratic politician from Ohio who served as the 54th mayor of Dayton, Ohio, from 2002 to 2010. McLin previously served as a member of both chambers of the Ohio General Assembly.

== Education ==

McLin received her Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and secondary education from Parsons College and her Master of Education in guidance counseling from Xavier University. She also holds an associate&#x27;s degree in mortuary science granted by the Cincinnati College of Mortuary Science.

== Career ==
In 1988, when McLin&#x27;s father, C. J. McLin, died, Rhine was appointed to serve the remainder of his term in the Ohio House of Representatives. She was then elected to the seat in 1990, and re-elected in 1992. She then was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1994, and re-elected to the senate in 1998. In 2001, McLin was named Minority Leader (completing the term of Ohio senator Ben Espy). She served as Minority Leader until she left the Senate in 2002, barred by term limits from running for re-election again that year. She ran for the office of mayor of Dayton.

McLin was elected mayor of Dayton in 2001, defeating incumbent Republican Michael R. Turner and began serving her term in 2002. She was re-elected in 2005, defeating opponent David R. Bohardt. McLin was an Ohio delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention. In 2009, she lost re-election for mayor.

In 1994, McLin became the first African-American woman elected to the Ohio State Senate. She was the first African-American woman to serve as Ohio Senate minority leader. Upon leaving the Senate, she became the first woman to serve as mayor of Dayton. She is the third African-American mayor of Dayton. Finally, in late 2005 she was the first African-American woman to serve as head of the Ohio Democratic Party.

Since 2012, McLin has served as the Vice Chairwoman of the Ohio Democratic Party. In August 2012, McLin was mentioned as a possible candidate to fill the Ohio state representative seat vacated by Clayton Luckie, but she ultimately declined to run.

<text>The Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE), based in Gallatin Gateway, Montana, is an American think tank that promotes free-market environmentalism. FREE emphasizes reliance on market mechanisms and private property rights, rather than on regulation, for protection of the environment. Its chairperson and founder, John Baden, stresses decentralization: a shift of control from what he calls &quot;green platonic despots&quot; in the federal government to &quot;local interests,&quot; including environmental groups. Citing conservation efforts such as those involving the Rocky Mountain Elk, Pheasants Forever, and Trout Unlimited, Baden asserts that the ideas FREE promotes have become &quot;the norm among progressive, intellectually honest and successful environmentalists.&quot; FREE&#x27;s mission is to attract and work with conservationists, conservatives, and classical liberals who treasure responsible liberty, sustainable ecology, and modest prosperity. 

John Baden has been a pioneer in free market environmentalism and its academic forerunner, the New Resource Economics. That work began with a 1973 article co-written with Richard Stroup, &quot;Externality, Property Rights, and the Management of Our National Forests,&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Law and Economics.&quot; This article identified problems with federal management of the national forests and explored the possible impacts of shifting those forests to private ownership. 

One of FREE&#x27;s past projects was the &quot;Charter Forest&quot; project, in which control of national forests were to be devolved to local trusts. The plan was endorsed by the Bush administration, but has yet to be put into effect.

Since 1992, FREE has offered expense-paid seminars in its philosophy to federal judges. These seminars have included such topics as &quot;Environmental Protection: The Role of Community-Based Solutions to Environmental Problems&quot;, &quot;The Environment: A CEO&#x27;s Perspective&quot;, and &quot;Liberty and the Environment: A Case for Judicial Activism&quot;. FREE says that nearly a third of the federal judiciary had either attended or were seeking to attend its seminars in the late 1990s. The group also offers expense-paid courses for university faculty and students, these reportedly taught on the campus of Montana State University.

Between August 14 and 19, 2004, FREE hosted the 2004 general meeting of the Mont Pèlerin Society at the Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City, Utah.

In 2013, she was recognized by Guinness World Records as the most prolific video game voice actor.

She also voices Thorn of the Hex Girls in various Scooby-Doo movies and TV episodes, as well as Cinderella and Princess Aurora in various Disney Princess media of the 2000s and 2010s. She is also known for voicing Jean Grey in a variety of Marvel media, most recently in &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;.

For her role as Commander Shepard, Hale was nominated for &quot;Best Performance by a Human Female&quot; twice at the 2010 and 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, as well as &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance&quot; at the 16th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards. In 2022, she has been nominated for &quot;Performer in a Leading Role&quot; at the 18th British Academy Games Awards, as well as &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Character&quot; at the 25th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, for her performance as Rivet in &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&quot;.

==Early life==
Hale was born in Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Her mother was what she called &quot;a wandering master&#x27;s degree pursuer&quot; and her stepfather was a microbiologist. She later told Tom Bissell of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that her biological father, James Learning, was an outdoorsman who was also a prominent NunatuKavut elder and environmental activist. Hale herself is a member of NunatuKavut, and self-identifies as being of partial southern Labrador Inuit descent. She would later call for support to free her father, who had advanced cancer, after he was imprisoned for refusing to sign an injunction to stay away from Muskrat Falls in 2017. Hale has a paternal half-sister, Carren Dujela, who works at the University of Victoria. She moved to the U.S. as a child and grew up in Alabama, mainly in Birmingham and Montgomery.

When Hale was a teenager, she got a voice-over spot at a local radio station, being paid $35 just to talk. In 1982, she graduated from Alabama School of Fine Arts, where she was in the theater department and was interested in being in a rock band. She stated, &quot;I started doing voice-over to pay for life and a PA system and everything else, and ended up that just sort of took over, acting took over.&quot; While in high school, she did more voice-over work for commercials, and also worked as a production assistant at age 17. She attended Birmingham–Southern College, where she found the program&#x27;s style was broader than what she wanted to do, and realized that she was more interested in film acting than theater acting. She graduated with a business degree. She began working as an actress and continued doing voice-overs, commuting frequently between Birmingham and Atlanta, Georgia.

==Career==
Hale&#x27;s first big break in acting was in 1988 for the made-for-television movie &quot;A Father&#x27;s Homecoming&quot;, which was an NBC movie of the week. She was also selected among a group of about six thousand girls in a nationwide search to be in several episodes of the &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; soap opera television series. After doing more regional work, she eventually moved to Los Angeles, where she took on sporadic guest roles typical for young actresses on shows such as &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, and &quot;Charmed&quot;. Her first major voice-over role in cartoons was the main character Ivy in &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; which was based on the computer game series. As it was her first cartoon, she sought extra classes and training. The show spanned multiple seasons until its final broadcast in 1999. Hale enjoyed the project and noted that it was one of the first network TV cartoons that met the educational requirements. Hale&#x27;s next animation project was &quot;Skeleton Warriors&quot; where &quot;there were ten cast members, [two] of whom were girls, and we blew stuff up and cartoon maimed each other every week.&quot;

The development of a tie-in video game for &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; gave Hale the opportunity to do her first ever voice-over for a video game. She describes her time with the game as a &quot;really confusing experience&quot; as it required a lot more lines and time than the show did. Her next major video game was with BioWare on their &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series on various roles, which would eventually lead to large roles in &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and other titles. She has been involved in many other cartoons. In 1994, she was cast as Felicia Hardy/Black Cat in &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, the first in a long line of Marvel Comics characters she has voiced. She plays Cinderella and Princess Aurora in various Disney projects, as well as voicing Dory from Finding Nemo throughout the Disney parks, filling in for Ellen DeGeneres. In 2003, Hale voiced Mrs. Little in the short-lived &quot;Stuart Little&quot; TV series.
Hale has provided the voice of lead character Sam and rival character Mandy in the French- and Canadian-produced animated television series &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;. In a 2004 interview, she said &quot;I&#x27;m so happy that David (Michel, creator and producer), Jamie (Simone, voice director) and everyone gave me the opportunity to be part of the show, it&#x27;s been one of my absolute favorite experiences.&quot; She describes Sam as &quot;smart and adventurous, but now you see more of her wacky side and her girly side as well,&quot; and Mandy as a &quot;total snot, which is fun too.&quot; She voiced the two characters as well as others for the show&#x27;s six seasons and its feature movie.
Hale voiced Bastila Shan in &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and returned for a brief appearance in the sequel &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords&quot;. She later voiced the female version of Jaden Korr in &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy&quot;. In the BioWare MMOPRG &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, Hale voiced the Republic Trooper Female as well as the recurring NPC Jedi Grand Master Satele Shan. Hale interpreted the voices of Fall-From-Grace and Deionarra in the role-playing computer game &quot;&quot;. She is also known as the &quot;voice&quot; of Samus Aran in all three games in the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; trilogy, providing grunts and screams as the player moves and takes damage. Hale is also known for playing several voices in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series (Naomi Hunter in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, and Emma Emmerich in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;).
Hale was also the voice of Jean Grey in &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; as well as a small role in &quot;Swat Kats&quot;. She also voiced British mercenary Jennifer Mui in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Mercenaries 2: World in Flames&quot;. In 2011, she was the voice of Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) on &quot;&quot;. She provided the voice of Leah in &quot;Diablo III&quot;, and appeared as Rosalind Lutece in &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;. Hale also played the role of Krem in BioWare&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Age: Inquisition&quot;. She also provided the voice for Kronika, the final boss of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;.
Hale was selected to voice Commander Shepard, the main player character in the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series. She had said that she is very invested in helping to &quot;create&quot; the stories of video games, though she herself is not a gamer. Although Hale does object to certain lines if they seem out-of-character in other works, she prefers not to mess with the words for Shepard and BioWare. Although reports showed that only 18% of players chose to play as a female Shepard in &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, (32% in &quot;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&quot;) vocal support for her character was high, leading to the fan-driven nickname &quot;FemShep&quot; and an e-mail campaign to put her character on the cover of &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;. She was nominated for &quot;Best Performance by a Human Female&quot; at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, in 2012, she was nominated again for &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;.

In February 2023, Hale guest voiced Riyo Chuchi, a Pantoran member of the Imperial Senate, in &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot;.

In 2021, Hale branched out from voice acting by founding two new businesses, Skills Hub and The Haven. Skills Hub is a coaching program for aspiring voice actors. Featuring 89 coaches including experienced voice actors and casting directors, Skills Hub teaches prospective voice actors skills on how to enter and navigate the VO/VA industry.

The Haven was a self help group led by Hale, run through Patreon. It featured monthly zoom calls and advice from Hale herself. The group was indefinitely paused as of June 2024 due to other commitments making scheduling difficult.

== Influences and reception ==

In an interview with &quot;The Geek Forge&quot; regarding her influences, Hale cited voice actors such as Dee Bradley Baker, Grey DeLisle, Phil LaMarr, Tress MacNeille, Kath Soucie, Frank Welker, and April Winchell, with emphasis on LaMarr. She also admires the work of actors Judi Dench, Edward James Olmos, and Mary McDonnell.

Hale&#x27;s peers and critics have noted her versatility in her roles: Michael Abbott, a professor at Wabash College who blogs about video games, said that she has made herself &quot;untraceable&quot; despite having voiced dozens of roles. Journalist Tom Bissell noted that she has been referred as &quot;a kind of Meryl Streep of the form&quot;. In an interview, she said, &quot;I love the anonymity. I could walk through Comic Con, and no matter how many people who might be a fan of what I do, we&#x27;re in proximity and no one knew. I&#x27;m invisible. If I&#x27;d have done as many on-camera roles as I&#x27;ve done voiceover, I couldn&#x27;t go to the grocery store in peace.&quot; She stated in the same interview, &quot;As cheesy as it sounds, the player is the star of the game. That&#x27;s the beauty of games—that it&#x27;s you that inhabits it. It&#x27;s not about someone else, it&#x27;s about that you get to be that person, and if I do my job right, I as a person disappear. Your experience is primary.&quot;
==Personal life==
Hale lived in the Los Angeles area, but since 2020, she has relocated back to Canada and now resides on Vancouver Island where she continues to do voice recordings from her personal home studio. She has a son. She has several pets and enjoys the outdoors, stating that she might have become an architect because she likes to redo houses. She has said that she was not allowed to watch cartoons as a child, and had not played any video games until her 2011 interview with Tom Bissell for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, in which she played &quot;Mass Effect&quot; for the first time. She likes horses and has mentioned being part of the local evacuation response team that rescues horses from advancing wildfires.

<text>A tribute act, tribute band, tribute group or tribute artist is a music group, singer, or musician who specifically plays the music of a well-known music act. Tribute acts include individual performers who mimic the songs and style of an artist, such as Elvis impersonators covering the works of Elvis Presley or groups like The Iron Maidens, an all-female band that pays tribute to Iron Maiden.

Many tribute bands, in addition to playing the music of an artist or group, also try to emulate the vocal styles and overall appearance of that group, to make as close an approximation as possible. Others introduce a twist on the original act; for example, Dread Zeppelin plays Led Zeppelin songs in a reggae style with a lead singer dressed up as Elvis Presley, while Gabba perform the songs of ABBA in the style of the Ramones.
Tribute bands usually name themselves based on the original band&#x27;s name (sometimes with a pun), or on one of their songs or albums.

==History==
In 1997, the British journalist Tony Barrell wrote a feature for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; about the UK tribute-band scene, which mentioned bands including Pink Fraud, the Pretend Pretenders and Clouded House. In the article, Barrell asserted that &quot;the main cradle of the tribute band...is Australia. Starved of big names, owing to their reluctance to put Oz on their tour itineraries, Australians were quite unembarrassed about creating home-grown versions. Then, like an airborne seed, one of these bands just happened to drift to Britain.&quot; The band in question was the ABBA tribute Björn Again, who staged a successful publicity stunt in the early 1990s, arriving at Heathrow Airport in white one-piece outfits similar to the ones worn by ABBA on the cover of their 1976 album, &quot;Arrival&quot;. Other tribute acts such as The Beatnix (Beatles), Zeppelin Live, and The Australian Pink Floyd Show have experienced continued popularity for over a decade.

Lead singer Rob Halford left Judas Priest in 1992 and was replaced by Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens from the tribute band British Steel in 1996. This was the first publicised example of a tribute performer joining the band they were paying tribute to and was the inspiration for the 2001 film &quot;Rock Star&quot;. Owens eventually left Judas Priest in 2003 when Halford rejoined the band. Later occurrences of this same phenomenon include Tommy Thayer replacing Ace Frehley in Kiss in 2002 and Benoît David replacing Jon Anderson in Yes after performing with a Yes tribute band called Close to the Edge. 

In 2000, filmmakers Jeff Economy and Darren Hacker produced the documentary film &quot;...An Incredible Simulation&quot;, which examined the tribute band phenomenon. The title was taken from the promotion of Beatlemania advertised as &quot;Not the Beatles, but an incredible simulation.&quot;

<text>Björn Again is an ABBA-inspired tribute band from Australia, consisting of performers from various countries. The name is a reference to ABBA guitarist and vocalist Björn Ulvaeus. The band has performed worldwide since it was formed in 1988.

==Character of the show==
Björn Again parodies Swedish pop group ABBA, using a mix of English and Swedish language known as &quot;Swenglish&quot; or pidgin Swedish. The performers use the stage names Agnetha Falstart, Benny Anderwear, Frida Longstokin and Björn Volvo-us in homage to the original ABBA members, plus bassist Rutger Sonofagunn and drummer Ola Drumkitt, based on Rutger Gunnarsson and Ola Brunkert. The show features choreographed acts with unique costumes and song arrangements that differ from ABBA&#x27;s original performances.

==History==

Björn Again was founded in 1988 in Melbourne, Australia, by Rod Stephen and John Tyrrell. The style is a light-hearted parody of ABBA performed in pidgin Swedish or &#x27;Swenglish.&#x27; Original band members included Rod Stephen, Peter Ryan, John Tyrrell, Dorina Morelli, Kathy Riseborough, Gavin Charles, and later Janette Stuart. Since the band&#x27;s debut in 1989, Björn Again has performed approximately 5,500 shows in 72 countries over 34 years. By 1997, the band had three touring lineups. John Tyrrell has been the band&#x27;s manager since the outset. Rod Stephen manages the UK/Europe lineup and John Tyrrell manages the Australasian lineup.

The band has recorded and performed live a total of 133 songs, including 55 ABBA songs, seven originals, and 62 covers by other artists. They released an EP of covers of Erasure songs performed in the style of ABBA, called Erasure-ish, which included the songs &quot;Stop!&quot; and &quot;A Little Respect&quot; that reached Number 25 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1992.

Björn Again has performed at events worldwide, ranging from large rock festivals, including Reading and Glastonbury, to private performances for celebrities, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, comedian Rowan Atkinson, actor Russell Crowe, and Russian president Vladimir Putin.

In 1999, the UK Bjorn Again took part in a documentary for Channel 5 entitled &quot;ABBA: Bjorn Again!&quot;, which featured the band on tour. Throughout the program the band members spoke in &quot;Swenglish&quot; accents. Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson have both praised Björn Again. After ABBA&#x27;s former members said they were not going to perform together again, Andersson was quoted as saying in 1999, &quot;Bjorn Again are the closest you can get to seeing ABBA.&quot;

The band attended a celebrity gala in costume at the London Savoy and received an award on behalf of ABBA from the Radio Times, to commemorate the 30 years since their Eurovision Song Contest win with &quot;Waterloo&quot; in Brighton on 6 April 1974. 

In 2009 the band performed Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, with an additional drummer, to a Sonisphere Festival crowd at Knebworth, as a nod to the headlining act. They were the opening act on the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 1999, 2009, and 2019.

On 17 December 2012, Björn Again performed at the Buckingham Palace Christmas party in London, attended by the Queen and members of the royal family. They also presented a show in honor of Agnetha Fältskog at Stockholm&#x27;s TV3/TV6 tenth-anniversary party, when Fältskog was quoted saying “It was a great show. I loved the choreography&quot; and &quot;Good luck for the tour.”

<text>George H. Walsh (November 24, 1845 – April 2, 1913) was an American newspaper editor and publisher from Grand Forks, North Dakota. He served on the council of the Dakota Territory and was instrumental in the founding of the University of North Dakota.

Walsh was one of the earliest settlers of Grand Forks. He was selected as a member of the Territorial Council, serving from 1879 until 1889. The council, in turn, elected him their president from 1879 until 1881. He also served in the North Dakota House of Representatives and as speaker during the 1893 session.

==Honors==
In 1881, when the territorial legislature authorized a new county north of Grand Forks, they named it Walsh County in his honor. Walsh Hall at the University of North Dakota bears his name.

<text>Riverdance is a theatrical show that consists mainly of traditional Irish music and dance. With a score composed by Bill Whelan, it originated as an interval act during the Eurovision Song Contest 1994, featuring Irish dancing champions Jean Butler, Michael Flatley and the vocal ensemble Anúna. Shortly afterwards, husband and wife production team John McColgan and Moya Doherty expanded it into a stage show, which opened in Dublin on 9 February 1995. As of 2023, the show continues to tour the world.

==Background==
Riverdance is rooted in a three-part suite of baroque-influenced traditional music called &quot;Timedance&quot;. The suite was composed, recorded and performed for the Eurovision Song Contest 1981, which was held in Ireland. At the time, Bill Whelan and Dónal Lunny composed the music, augmenting the Irish folk band Planxty with a rock rhythm section of electric bass and drums and a four-piece horn section. The piece was performed, with accompanying dancers from Dublin City Ballet, during the interval of the contest, and later released as a Planxty single. Whelan had also produced &quot;EastWind&quot;, a 1992 album by Planxty member Andy Irvine with Davy Spillane, which fused Irish and Balkan folk music and influenced the genesis of &quot;Riverdance&quot;. After composing &quot;Riverdance&quot;, Whelan said, &quot;It was no mistake of mine to call it Riverdance because it connected absolutely to Timedance&quot;.

==History==
===1994===

Riverdance was first performed during the seven-minute interval of the Eurovision Song Contest 1994 at the Point Theatre in Dublin on 30 April 1994. The performance was transmitted to an estimated 300 million viewers worldwide and earned a standing ovation. The performance is often considered the most well-known interval act in Eurovision history and is credited with transforming Irish dance from a chaste and reserved traditional dance form into a new, modern form. The original seven-minute version was invited to perform at Dominion Theatre in London at the Royal Variety Performance in the presence of Prince Charles in November 1994.

The song &quot;Riverdance&quot;, featuring Anúna and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, was released as a single and subsequently topped the Irish Singles Chart for a record-setting 18 weeks. As of 2010, it was still the second highest-selling single of all time in Ireland, behind only Elton John&#x27;s 1997 double A-side &quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;/&quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot;.

===1995===

After witnessing the initial enthusiasm for the interval act performance in Ireland, husband and wife production team John McColgan and Moya Doherty invested over $1 million into producing a full-length show. Tickets for the show were released for a five-week run and sold out within three days of going on sale.

&quot;Riverdance: The Show&quot; opened at the Point Theatre in Dublin on 9 February 1995. The show starred lead dancers Michael Flatley and Jean Butler. The video of the show topped the Irish and UK charts in 1995.

The show moved to London in June 1995, where it had a sell-out four-week run at The Apollo. During its time in London, Riverdance performed at the Royal Gala 50th Anniversary of VE Day celebrations at the invitation of Prince Charles and at the Royal College of Music in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II.

The show returned to the Point Theatre in July 1995 for a sell-out six-week run.

The show&#x27;s growing success coincided with lead dancer Michael Flatley clashing with the producers over salary and royalty fees. By early October 1995, a contract dispute over creative control led to Riverdance parting ways with Flatley on the eve of reopening for a second sell-out run at The Apollo. He was replaced by Colin Dunne. At the same time, female lead Jean Butler was unable to perform due to an injury. As a result, Dunne paired up with Eileen Martin for the opening night. The initial six weeks at The Apollo was extended twice. During this extended period, Riverdance returned to the Royal Variety Performance at Dominion Theatre.

===1996–1998===
Riverdance travelled to the United States for the first time in March 1996. On 13 March, the show opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York City for the first of eight sold-out performances over five days. Costing about $2 million to bring the show from Ireland, Riverdance broke even in its first New York outing.

Upon returning from New York, Riverdance went on to have another notable extended run at The Apollo between May 1996 and January 1997. By late 1996, Riverdance had created separate companies in order to tour multiple cities at the same time. The Lee company began a U.S. tour in October 1996. Riverdance toured Australia for the first time in 1997.

In 1997, Bill Whelan received a Best Musical Show Album Grammy Award for his recording of &#x27;Riverdance&#x27;.

A number of notable cast departures occurred around this time, with Anúna leaving in September 1996; Butler leaving in January 1997; and Dunne leaving in June 1998.

===Early 2000s===
In 2000, Riverdance performed on Broadway in New York at the Gershwin Theatre. In 2003, Riverdance featured at the Opening Ceremony of the Special Olympics in Dublin and toured China for the first time.

==Legacy==

In 2020, Riverdance&#x27;s 25th Anniversary show began touring. As of 2023, Riverdance has played more than 15,000 performances across 49 countries and six continents. The show has been seen live by more than 30 million people.

In 2021, an animated feature film titled &quot;&quot; was released.

<doc id="709683" wikidata="Q370335" url="?curid=709683" title="Criticism of Microsoft">
<text>Criticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Issues with ease of use, robustness, and security of the company&#x27;s software are common targets for critics. In the 2000s, a number of malware mishaps targeted security flaws in Windows and other products. Microsoft was also accused of locking vendors and consumers in to their products, and of not following or complying with existing standards in its software. Total cost of ownership comparisons between Linux and Microsoft Windows are a continuous point of debate.

The company has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, brought by several governments and by other companies, for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the European Union found Microsoft guilty in the &quot;Microsoft Corp. v. Commission&quot; case, and it received an 899 million euro fine.

== Ties to US Government departments ==
On September 14, 2019, Microsoft&#x27;s flagship store was shut down by protestors as part of a direct action organized by Close the Camps NYC. The action was in response to Microsoft&#x27;s $19.4 million contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Microsoft&#x27;s relationship with the immigration enforcement agency was revealed by executive Tom Keane, through a company blog post that describes ICE&#x27;s use of the company&#x27;s high-security cloud storage product Azure Government. He went on to say the company is &quot;proud to support&quot; the work of ICE. Microsoft has stated it &quot;is not working with the U.S. government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border.&quot;

In February 2019, some of Microsoft’s employees protested the company&#x27;s war profiteering from a $480 million contract to develop augmented reality headsets for the United States Army.

== Vendor lock-in ==
From its inception, Microsoft defined itself as a platform company and understood the importance of attracting third-party programmers. It did so by providing development tools, training, access to proprietary APIs in early versions, and partner programs. Although the resulting ubiquity of Microsoft software allows a user to benefit from network effects, critics and even Microsoft itself decry what they consider to be an &quot;embrace, extend and extinguish&quot; strategy of adding proprietary features to open standards or their software implementations, thereby using its market dominance to gain unofficial ownership of standards &quot;extended&quot; in this way.

Microsoft software is also presented as a &quot;safe&quot; choice for IT managers purchasing software systems. In an internal memo for senior management Microsoft&#x27;s head of C++ development, Aaron Contorer, stated:

More recently, Microsoft had their OOXML specification approved by the ISO standards body in a manner consistent with previous attempts to control standards.
With the release of Windows 8, Microsoft began requiring OEM devices to ship with UEFI system firmware, configured by default to only allow the execution of operating system binaries digitally signed by Microsoft (UEFI secure boot). Concerns were raised that this requirement would hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as Linux. In a post discussing secure boot on the &quot;Building Windows 8&quot; blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that &quot;At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC. Microsoft&#x27;s philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves.&quot; As such, vendors were required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot (although devices running Windows RT, a variation of Windows 8 for ARM architecture, have locked firmware where this cannot be disabled). No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs.

== Copyright enforcement ==
When Microsoft discovered that its first product, Altair BASIC, was subject to widespread unauthorized copying, Microsoft founder Bill Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists that openly accused many hobbyists of stealing software. Gates&#x27; letter provoked many responses, with some hobbyists objecting to the broad accusation, and others supporting the principle of compensation.
This disagreement over whether software should be proprietary continues into the present day under the banner of the free software movement, with Microsoft characterizing free software released under the terms of the GPL as being &quot;potentially viral&quot; and the GNU General Public License itself as a &quot;viral license&quot; which &quot;infects&quot; proprietary software and forces its developer to have to release proprietary source to the public.

The Halloween documents, internal Microsoft memos which were leaked to the open source community beginning in 1998, indicate that some Microsoft employees perceive &quot;open source&quot; software — in particular, Linux — as a growing long-term threat to Microsoft&#x27;s position in the software industry. The Halloween documents acknowledged that parts of Linux are superior to the versions of Microsoft Windows available at the time, and outlined a strategy of &quot;de-commoditize[ing] protocols &amp; applications.&quot;
Microsoft stated in its 2006 Annual Report that it was a defendant in at least 35 patent infringement lawsuits. The company&#x27;s litigation expenses for April 2004 through March 2007 exceed $4.3 billion: over $4 billion in payouts, plus $300 million in legal fees.

Another concern of critics is that Microsoft may be using the distribution of shared source software to harvest names of developers who have been exposed to Microsoft code, as some believe that these developers could someday be the target of lawsuits if they were ever to participate in the development of competing products. This issue is addressed in published papers from several organizations including the American Bar Association and the Open Source Initiative.

Starting in the 1990s, Microsoft was accused of maintaining &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;secret&quot; APIs: interfaces to its operating system software that it deliberately keeps undocumented to gain a competitive advantage in its application software products.
Microsoft employees have consistently denied this;
they claim that application developers inside and outside Microsoft routinely reverse-engineered DOS and 16-bit versions of Windows without any inside help, creating legacy support problems that far exceeded any alleged benefit to Microsoft.
In response to court orders, Microsoft has published interfaces between components of its operating system software, including components like Internet Explorer, Active Directory, and Windows Media that sell as part of Windows but compete with application software.

On October 10, 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents.

== Mono patent concerns ==

On July 6, 2009, Microsoft announced that it was placing their ECMA 334 and ECMA 335 specifications under their Community Promise pledging that they would not assert their patents against anyone implementing, distributing, or using alternative implementations of .NET. Mono&#x27;s implementation of those components of the .NET stack not submitted to the ECMA for standardization has been the source of patent violation concerns for much of the life of the project. In particular, discussion has taken place about whether Microsoft could destroy the Mono project through patent suits.

The base technologies submitted to the ECMA, and therefore also the Unix/GNOME-specific parts, are claimed to be safe due to Microsoft&#x27;s explicitly placing both ECMA 334 (C#) and ECMA 335 (CLI) standards under the Microsoft Community Promise. The concerns primarily relate to technologies developed by Microsoft on top of the .NET Framework, such as ASP.NET, ADO.NET and Windows Forms (see non-standardized namespaces), i.e. parts composing Mono&#x27;s Windows compatibility stack. These technologies are today not fully implemented in Mono and not required for developing Mono-applications, they are simply there for developers and users who need full compatibility with the Windows system.

In June 2009 the Ubuntu Technical Board stated that it saw &quot;no reason to exclude Mono or applications based upon it from the archive, or from the default installation set.&quot;

The Free Software Foundation&#x27;s Richard Stallman has stated on June 2, 2009, that &quot;[...] we should discourage people from writing programs in C#. Therefore, we should not include C# implementations in the default installation of GNU/Linux distributions or in their principal ways of installing GNOME&quot;. On July 1, 2009, Brett Smith (also from the FSF) stated that &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s patents are much more dangerous: it&#x27;s the only major software company that has declared itself the enemy of GNU/Linux and stated its intention to attack our community with patents.&quot;, &quot;C# represents a unique threat to us&quot; and &quot;The Community Promise does nothing to change any of this&quot;.

Fedora Project Leader Paul Frields has stated, &quot;We do have some serious concerns about Mono and we&#x27;ll continue to look at it with our legal counsel to see what if any steps are needed on our part&quot;, yet &quot;We haven&#x27;t come to a legal conclusion that is pat enough for us to make the decision to take mono out&quot;.

In November 2011 at an Ubuntu Developer Summit, developers voted to have the Mono-based Banshee media player removed from Ubuntu&#x27;s default installation beginning on Ubuntu 12.04; although reported reasonings included performance issues on ARM architecture, blocking issues on its GTK+ 3 version, and it being, in their opinion, &quot;not well maintained&quot;, speculation also surfaced that the decision was also influenced by a desire to remove Mono from the base distribution, as the remaining programs dependent on Mono, gbrainy and Tomboy, were also to be removed. Mono developer Joseph Michael Shields defended the performance of Banshee on ARM, and also the claims that Banshee was not well-maintained as being a &quot;directed personal insult&quot; to one of its major contributors.

== Ignoring unauthorized copying ==

Microsoft ignored unauthorized copying of its own software for their benefit on the long term. While talking about users in China who do not pay for the software they use in 2006, to an audience at the University of Washington, Bill Gates said &quot;And as long as they&#x27;re going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They&#x27;ll get sort of addicted, and then we&#x27;ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.&quot;

The practice allowed Microsoft to gain some dominance over the Chinese market and only then taking measures against unauthorized copies. In 2008, by means of the Windows update mechanism, a verification program called &quot;Windows Genuine Advantage&quot; (WGA) was downloaded and installed. When WGA detects that the copy of Windows is not genuine, it periodically turns the user&#x27;s screen black. This behavior angered users and generated complaints in China with a lawyer stating that &quot;Microsoft uses its monopoly to bundle its updates with the validation programs and forces its users to verify the genuineness of their software&quot;.

== Licensing agreements ==
A common complaint comes from those who want to purchase a computer that usually comes preinstalled with Windows &quot;without&quot; a copy of Windows pre-installed and without paying extra for the license either so that another operating system can be used or because a license was already acquired elsewhere, such as through the MSDN Academic Alliance program. Microsoft encourages original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to supply computers with Windows pre-installed by presenting their dominance in computer sales and arguing that consumers benefit by not having to install an operating system. Because the price of the license varies depending on discounts given to the OEM and because there is no similar computer that the OEM offers without Windows, there is no immediate way to find the size of the refund. In 2009, Microsoft stated that it has always charged OEMs about $50 for a Windows license on a $1,000 computer.

While it is possible to obtain a computer with no or free operating systems, virtually all large computer vendors continue to bundle Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges. The claimed increase in the price of a computer resulting from the inclusion of a Windows license has been called the &quot;Windows tax&quot; or &quot;Microsoft tax&quot; by opposing computer users. The Findings of Fact in the United States Microsoft antitrust case of 1998 established that &quot;One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed. In 1998, all major OEMs agreed to this restriction.&quot; Microsoft also once assessed license fees based on the number of computers an OEM sold, regardless of whether a Windows license was included; Microsoft was forced to end this practice due to a consent decree. In 2010, Microsoft stated that its agreements with OEMs to distribute Windows are nonexclusive, and OEMs are free to distribute computers with a different operating system or without any operating system.

Microsoft does not provide refunds for Windows licenses sold through an OEM, including licenses that come with the purchase of a computer or are pre-installed on a computer.

According to Microsoft&#x27;s End-user license agreement for Windows 7 the ability to receive a refund for the operating system is determined by the hardware manufacturer: Acer Inc. has a policy of requiring the customer to return items at their own expense, and the balance received by the customer can be as low as €30. In other cases, vendors have asked that customers requesting refunds sign non-disclosure agreements.

Older versions of Microsoft Windows had different license terms with respect to the availability of a refund for Windows: Based on the updated language, vendors refused to issue partial refunds for Windows licenses, requiring that the computer be returned altogether. In some countries, this practice has been ruled a violation of consumer protection law.

Additionally, the EULA for Windows Vista was criticized for being too restrictive.

== Litigation ==
Microsoft&#x27;s market dominance and business practices have attracted widespread resentment, which is not necessarily restricted to the company&#x27;s competitors. In a 2003 publication, Dan Geer argued the prevalence of Microsoft products has resulted in a monoculture which is dangerously easy for viruses to exploit.

On June 25, 2024, the European Commission accused Microsoft of violating the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by bundling Microsoft Teams with Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office. 

== Labor practices ==
Microsoft has been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as &quot;temporary,&quot; and therefore without medical benefits), use of forced retention tactics, where departing employees would be sued to prevent departure, as well as more traditional cost-saving measures, ranging from cutting medical benefits to not providing towels in company locker rooms.

Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a &quot;Velvet Sweatshop&quot;, a term which originated in a 1989 &quot;Seattle Times&quot; article, and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft&#x27;s own employees. This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health. For example, the kitchenettes have free beverages and many buildings include exercise rooms and showers. However, the company has been accused of attempting to keep employees at the company for exceptionally long hours. This is detailed in several books about Microsoft, including &quot;Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire&quot;.

A US state lawsuit was brought against Microsoft in 1992 representing 8,558 current and former employees that had been classified as &quot;temporary&quot; and &quot;freelance&quot;, and became known as &quot;Vizcaino v. Microsoft&quot;. In 1993, the suit became a US Federal Class Action in the United States District Court Western District Of Washington at Seattle as No. C93-178C. The Final Settlement came in 2005. The case was decided on the (IRS-defined) basis that such &quot;permatemps&quot; had their jobs defined by Microsoft, worked alongside regular employees doing the same work, and worked for long terms. After a series of court setbacks including three reversals on appeal, Microsoft settled the suit for US$97 million.

A side effect of the &quot;permatemp&quot; lawsuit is that now contract employees are prevented from participating in team morale events and other activities that could be construed as making them &quot;employees&quot;. They are also limited to 18-month contracts and must leave after that time for 6 months before returning under contract.

Microsoft is the largest American corporate user of H-1B guest worker visas and has joined other large technology companies like Google in recently lobbying for looser H-1B visa restrictions.

Jesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. Jackson has urged other companies to diversify their workforce. He believes that Microsoft made some progress when it appointed two women to its board of directors in 2015.

== Advertising and public relations ==
Critics have alleged that Microsoft has used funding to drum up support from think tanks and trade organizations such as the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI), the Independent Institute, and Americans for Technology Leadership (ATL). During the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft, ATL sent a poll to 19 state attorneys general purporting to show that &quot;the public believes state AGs should devote their energy to causes other than Microsoft&quot;. Also during the case the Independent Institute ran full-page advertisements in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; defending Microsoft, which was later revealed to have funded the ad campaign. The institute published &quot;Winners, Losers, and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology&quot; shortly thereafter.

In June 2002, the AdTI published a report, quickly pulled under the argument that it was a draft version, which contained criticism of the copyleft model and the GNU General Public License. A May 2002 press release for the report stated that it would contain arguments suggesting that governments could be threatened by hackers and terrorists (who could study potential vulnerabilities due to source availability) if it used open source software. However, the draft contained no references to these topics. Open Source Initiative (OSI) founder Bruce Perens felt that the report had &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s paws all over [it]&quot;. Microsoft argued that its funding was for AdTI&#x27;s operations as a whole, and not relevant to any specific research by the organization.

&quot;Champagne&quot;, a 2002 British television advert for the Xbox, received 136 complaints from viewers to the Independent Television Commission (ITC) over its content. The advert featured a newborn baby being launched out of its mother—aging as it flies through the air, and crashing into a gravestone. It contained the tagline &quot;Life is short, play more.&quot; The advert was banned from television by the ITC, who considered it to be &quot;offensive, shocking and in bad taste&quot;, noting complaints citing the advert&#x27;s themes of death and the &quot;traumatic experience&quot; the person was facing in the ad.

In August 2004, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ordered Microsoft to pull ads in Britain that claimed that the total cost of ownership of Linux servers was ten times that of Windows Server 2003. The comparison included the cost of hardware, and put Linux at a disadvantage by installing it on more expensive but poorer-performing hardware compared to that used for Windows.

On January 22, 2007, Rick Jelliffe made a claim on his blog that a Microsoft employee offered to pay him to make corrections in English Wikipedia articles concerning Office Open XML. Microsoft spokesperson Catherine Brooker expressed the belief that the article had been &quot;heavily written&quot; by IBM employees who supported the rival OpenDocument format, though she provided no specific evidence. Internet entrepreneur and Wikimedia Foundation founder Jimmy Wales described Microsoft&#x27;s offer as unethical.

In 2009, it was found that a photo on the Polish version of Microsoft&#x27;s business productivity website—which depicted three people of various races during an office meeting—had been edited to replace the head of an African-American man with that of a Caucasian, whilst also failing to edit the person&#x27;s hand to match the different skin color. Microsoft apologized and quickly removed the image.

In 2011, Moneylife.in alleged that two &quot;anonymous comments boosting their product&quot;—one by a Nokia employee and another by a Microsoft employee—were posted on their review of Nokia Lumia 800, which was based only on the &quot;technical specifications&quot; and the reviewer &quot;hadn&#x27;t laid a finger on the phone&quot;. In conclusion, Charles Arthur argued &quot;Nobody has come out of the episode looking good. Sapkale was accused of breaking his own site&#x27;s privacy policy by posting the IP and email addresses of the commenters, while the commenting duo&#x27;s failure to declare any interest looked, at best, like astroturfing.&quot;

In 2014 details on a partnership between Machinima.com and Microsoft came to light regarding a marketing campaign for Xbox One. Machinima would offer some of its users $3 per thousand views if the user showed 30 seconds of an Xbox One game and mentioned the system by name. Controversy arose when it was reported that, under the terms of the promotion, participants were not allowed to disclose that they were being paid for said endorsements, which Ars Technica said conflicted with FTC regulations requiring recipients to fully disclose when such actions occur. Machinima stated that the confidentiality clause only applied to the terms of the agreement, and not to the existence of the agreement, and Microsoft ended the promotion and directed Machinima to add disclosures to the videos involved. In September 2015, Machinima settled with the FTC over charges that the ad campaign failed to comply with FTC endorsement guidelines; the FTC decided not to take action against Microsoft since it already has &quot;policies and procedures designed to prevent such lapses&quot;.

Since the 2010s, Microsoft has faced criticism for using adware-like tactics to market recent software and services. Microsoft faced criticism over its marketing and distribution of no-cost Windows 10 upgrades for Windows 7 and 8 users, which included a &quot;Get Windows 10&quot; application automatically downloaded via Windows Update that displayed popups advertising the offer, use of dark patterns to coax users into installing the operating system, downloading installation files without user consent, and making it difficult for users to suppress the advertising and notifications if they did not wish to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft has used advertising embedded in the Microsoft Bing search engine and Microsoft Edge web browser to discourage the use of competing web browser Google Chrome (which shares the same engine as Edge), including displaying prominent ads on specific search terms, and programming Edge to inject on-screen notifications and banner advertising when browsing Chrome&#x27;s web site. In 2023 and 2024, Microsoft began using notifications to encourage Chrome users to switch to Microsoft Bing and Microsoft Copilot.

== Tax avoidance ==

As reported by several news outlets, an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for &#x27;Microsoft Round Island One&#x27;, a subsidiary that collects licence fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP in the UK said, &quot;It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business&quot;.

In 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of &quot;nearly 0%.&quot; When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations.

== Blacklisting of journalists ==
John C. Dvorak said that in the 1980s, Microsoft classified journalists as &quot;Okay&quot;, &quot;Sketchy&quot;, or &quot;Needs work&quot; and targeted &quot;Needs work&quot; journalists in an attempt to have them terminated. Dvorak said that he was denied information about Windows because he was on a blacklist. Mary Jo Foley stated that she was denied interviews with Microsoft personnel for several years following the publication of a story based on a memo describing the number of bugs in Windows 2000 at release.

== Censorship in China == 
Microsoft (along with Google, Yahoo, Cisco, AOL, Skype, and other companies) has cooperated with the Chinese government in implementing a system of Internet censorship. Human rights advocates such as Human Rights Watch and media groups such as Reporters Without Borders criticized the companies, noting for example that it is &quot;ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor.&quot; Since 2009, Microsoft has run a local version of Bing in China that censors thousands of websites and phrases such as &quot;human rights&quot; and &quot;Communist Party corruption&quot;.

=== Bing censorship of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre ===

On June 4, 2021, the 32nd anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, searches for the Tank Man image and videos were censored by Microsoft Bing search engine worldwide. Hours after Microsoft acknowledged the issue, the search returned only pictures of tanks elsewhere in the world. Search engines that license results from Microsoft such as DuckDuckGo and Yahoo faced similar issues. Microsoft said the issue was &quot;due to an accidental human error.&quot; According to a &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; investigation, the full explanation was that Microsoft accidentally applied its Chinese blacklist to the rest of the world.

The director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, said he found the idea it was an inadvertent error &quot;hard to believe&quot;. David Greene, Civil Liberties Director at Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that content moderation was impossible to do perfectly and &quot;egregious mistakes are made all the time&quot;, but he further elaborated that &quot;At worst, this was purposeful suppression at the request of a powerful state.&quot;

== Privacy issues ==
=== Collaboration with the NSA on internet surveillance ===
Microsoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program, according to leaked NSA documents obtained by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak. The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program.

In July 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; elaborated that leaked documents show that:
* Microsoft helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to intercept web chats on Outlook.com and gave it unencrypted access to Outlook.com and Hotmail email.
* Microsoft provided the NSA with access to users&#x27; data on its cloud storage service OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive).
* After Microsoft bought Skype, the NSA tripled the number of Skype video calls being collected through PRISM.
In a statement, Microsoft said that they &quot;provide customer data only in response to legal processes.&quot;

=== Telemetry and data collection ===
Windows 10 was criticized on-launch for having default settings that send various information regarding user behaviors to Microsoft and its &quot;trusted partners&quot;, such as data regarding user contacts and calendar events, location data and history, &quot;telemetry&quot; (diagnostics data); this could not be fully disabled on non-enterprise versions of Windows 10), an &quot;advertising ID&quot;, as well as further data when the Cortana assistant is enabled in full.

Microsoft faced criticism from France&#x27;s data protection commission and the European Union for its practices in regards to Windows 10. On subsequent iterations of the OS, Microsoft has clarified its data collection policies, and made its out-of-box experience provide clearer information on Windows privacy settings, and the effects they have on the overall user experience. Microsoft also simplified its &quot;telemetry&quot; options to only consist of &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Full&quot; modes, and reduced the amount of system information collected in &quot;Basic&quot; mode.

In November 2018, the Dutch government issued a report stating that telemetry implementations in Office 365 violated the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In July 2019 the company tasked with investigating the privacy risks reported that Microsoft had adequately addressed these issues in Office 365 ProPlus, while the other concerns still remained.

==Robot journalism==
In May 2020, Microsoft announced that a number of its MSN contract journalists would be replaced by robot journalism leading to criticism about which stories would be displayed and their quality.

==Xbox live controversies==
===Xbox Live prohibition on use of the word &quot;gay&quot;===
Microsoft has come under some criticism for its attitude to homosexuality and Xbox Live. Users may not use the string &quot;gay&quot; in a gamertag (even in a non-homosexual context, for example as part of a surname), or refer to homosexuality in their profile (including self-identifying as such), as the company considers this &quot;content of a sexual nature&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; to other users and therefore unsuitable for the service. After banning &#x27;Teresa&#x27;, a lesbian gamer who had been harassed by other users for being a homosexual, a senior Xbox Live team member, Stephen Toulouse, has clarified the policy, stating that &quot;Expression of any sexual orientation [...] is not allowed in gamertags&quot; but that they are &quot;examining how we can provide it in a way that won&#x27;t get misused&quot;. GLAAD weighed in on the controversy as well, supporting the steps that Microsoft has taken over the years to engage the LGBT community.

===2021 Xbox Live subscription price increase===
On January 22, 2021, Microsoft announced that the pricing model for Xbox Live subscriptions would be increasing across each price tier, with a year of the service doubling from US$60 to US$120 for users. The move was met with widespread criticism from users and news media, with speculation that the change was meant to make the Xbox Game Pass subscription more enticing. In response to the backlash, on the same day that the price increase was announced, Microsoft reversed the decision to increase the price of Xbox Live.

== ANS patent controversy ==
Asymmetric numeral systems is widely used family of method in data compression, whose author gave it to public domain - wanting to be unrestricted by the patent system, also successfully defending from patent by Google. In June 2019 Microsoft lodged a patent application called &#x27;Features of range asymmetric number system encoding and decoding&#x27;. The USPTO issued a final rejection of the application on October 27, 2020. Yet on March 2, 2021, Microsoft gave a USPTO explanatory filing stating &quot;The Applicant respectfully disagrees with the rejections, seeking to overturn the final rejection under the &quot;After Final Consideration Pilot 2.0&quot; program. The application is currently still pending, as USPTO has not confirmed if it will allow the rejection appeal to proceed.

== Xinjiang region ==

In 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute accused at least 82 major brands of being connected to forced Uyghur labor in Xinjiang. Microsoft is reported as being supplied by three Chinese factories employing Uyghur and Xinjiang workers. In 2024, a Microsoft incubator was reported to have provided support to two Chinese companies that sell software used for censorship in China.

<text>Leominster was a non-metropolitan district in Hereford and Worcester, England from 1974 to 1998. The council was based in the town of Leominster.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of six former districts, which were abolished at the same time:
*Kington Rural District
*Kington Urban District
*Leominster Municipal Borough
*Leominster and Wigmore Rural District
*Tenbury Rural District
*Weobley Rural District
The Tenbury district had previously been in Worcestershire, the other five districts had previously been in Herefordshire. The two counties merged at the same time to become Hereford and Worcester, with Leominster being one of nine districts in the new county, and one of only two which straddled the two historic counties (the other being Malvern Hills District).

In 1998, the district of Leominster and the county of Hereford and Worcester were both abolished, with the former Herefordshire parts of Leominster district becoming part of the new unitary authority of Herefordshire, whilst the former Worcestershire parts were transferred to a redefined Malvern Hills District, which remained in a two tier structure with a re-established Worcestershire County Council as its new county council.

<doc id="709691" wikidata="Q1370595" url="?curid=709691" title="Straperlo">
<text>Straperlo was a scheme which originated in the Netherlands in the 1930s and was then introduced in Spain. In essence it was a fraudulent roulette which could be controlled electrically with the push of a button. The ensuing scandal was one of the several causes of the fall of the Republican government and the polarization of the parliament, which finally led to the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).

==Name==
The name had its origin in the names of the Dutch partners, one of whom was Daniel Strauss, but sources differ on the exact name or names of the others. Some sources say that there was just one other, called Jules Perel. Others state that there was a third female partner, Lowann, the wife of Strauss, but Paul Preston holds Perlowitz as the second partner. According to other sources, the name was in reference to the roulette machines (extra pearl).

==Scandal==
In the Netherlands, Straperlo had been introduced at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen in June 1933. By October 1933, it had been banned by the Dutch Ministry of Justice.

In 1934, Rafael Salazar Alonso was the conservative Minister of Interior in Spain. He was one of several prominent Radical Republican Party figures to accept bribes in order to legalize the fixed roulette. He received a gold watch and 100,000 pesetas (€221,172 historic standard of living value in 2021). Other high-ranking officials in his Ministry also accepted them.

Still, Salazar Alonso considered it too little, demanded more, and eventually arranged a police raid into the Grand Casino Kursaal of San Sebastián on the inauguration day. To get back at him, the inventors leaked documents on the matter to President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora. A complementary version notes that since they had invested a lot of money in the venture, they tried to recover it by blackmailing Prime Minister Alejandro Lerroux, whose nephew was involved in the scheme and influence peddling.

Lerroux refused to get involved, and Strauss denounced the affair to President Alcalá-Zamora, who made it public. The matter was debated at the Spanish Cortes in October 1935, which exonerated Salazar Alonso, with the help of CEDA. José Antonio Primo de Rivera, disgusted by the corruption on display, shouted an ironic &quot;Long live the Straperlo!&quot; from the gallery. Despite Alonso&#x27;s official exoneration, the affair permanently ruined his reputation and doomed the Radical Party, although he hung onto his position as mayor of Madrid.

==Consequences==
The reaction of the parties in the opposition, along with the reaction to the Nombela affair, caused the fall of Lerroux and his Radical Republican Party government. The new elections were won by the Popular Front and supported by the Communist Party of Spain, amid great instability, while the Radical Republicans collapsed. The election ultimately resulted in the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; promulgated by General Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists in July 1936.

==Usage==
After the scandal, especially after the Spanish Civil War, the word was incorporated as &quot;estraperlo&quot; into the Spanish language, and into the Catalan language, with the meaning of any scheme which is illegal or corrupt, particularly the black market.

<doc id="709692" wikidata="Q862461" url="?curid=709692" title="Bill Sienkiewicz">
<text>Boleslav William Felix Robert Sienkiewicz ( ; ; born May 3, 1958) is an American artist known for his work in comic books—particularly for Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;New Mutants&quot;, &quot;Moon Knight,&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He is the co-creator of the character David Haller / Legion, the basis for the FX television series &quot;Legion&quot;. 

Sienkiewicz&#x27;s work in the 1980s was considered revolutionary in mainstream US comics due to his highly stylized art that verged on abstraction and made use of oil painting, photorealism, collage, mimeograph, and other forms generally uncommon in comic books.

==Early life==
Sienkiewicz was born May 3, 1958, in Blakely, Pennsylvania. When he was five years old, he moved with his family to the Hainesville section of Sandyston Township, New Jersey, where he attended elementary and secondary school. Sienkiewicz began drawing &quot;when [he] was about four or five&quot;, and continued doing and learning about art throughout his childhood. His early comic book influences include artist Curt Swan Superman comics, and artist Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

Sienkiewicz received his classical art education at the Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts in Newark, New Jersey.

After art school, he showed a portfolio of his work to DC Comics&#x27; art director Vince Colletta, which led to his entering the comics field at age 19. The artist recalled in 1985, &quot;They didn&#x27;t have any work for me, but that didn&#x27;t bother me. I just figured that if comics didn&#x27;t work out I&#x27;d have done advertising or illustration. Vinnie called [renowned comics and advertising artist] Neal Adams, who put me in touch with [Marvel Comics editor-in-chief] Jim Shooter. Soon after that I was drawing &quot;Moon Knight&quot;, in &quot;The Hulk&quot; [black-and-white comics] magazine&quot;. His early art style was heavily influenced by Neal Adams.

==Career==
===Comics===

Sienkiewicz continued as the artist of the &quot;Moon Knight&quot; color comics series, starting with the first issue (November 1980). His eclectic art style helped shed the early perception of Moon Knight as a mere Batman clone. Four years later, after a stint as artist on the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, he became the artist on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; spin-off &quot;New Mutants&quot;, beginning with issue No. 18 (August 1984), producing cover paintings and character designs. From this period on, Sienkiewicz&#x27;s art evolved into a much more expressionistic style, and he began experimenting with paint, collage, and mixed media. He illustrated &quot;New Mutants&quot; from 1984 to 1985.

Sienkiewicz produced covers for a range of Marvel titles, including &quot;Rom&quot;, &quot;Dazzler&quot;, &quot;The Mighty Thor&quot;, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; and &quot;The Transformers&quot;, and drew the comic adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;.

Sienkiewicz&#x27;s own first writing credit was for the painted story &quot;Slow Dancer&quot; in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; in 1986. Sienkiewicz both wrote and illustrated the 1988 miniseries &quot;Stray Toasters&quot;, an idiosyncratic work published by Epic Comics about a criminal psychologist investigating a series of murders. His first major interior work for DC Comics was contributing to &quot;Batman&quot; #400 (October 1986).

He illustrated the 1986-87 eight-issue &quot;&quot; limited series and the &quot;Daredevil: Love and War&quot; graphic novel which were both written by Frank Miller.

After this, he collaborated with writer Andy Helfer on the first six issues of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;The Shadow&quot; series.

In 1988, he contributed to the &quot;Brought to Light&quot; graphic novel with writer Alan Moore. In 1990, Sienkiewicz and Moore published the first two issues of the uncompleted series &quot;Big Numbers&quot;. Sienkiewicz painted the &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; adaptation of the novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

Sienkiewicz was the subject of a 2008 full-length documentary/interview produced by Woodcrest Productions, &quot;The Creator Chronicles: Bill Sienkiewicz&quot;.

In 2007, Sienkiewicz penciled &quot;30 Days of Night: Beyond Barrow&quot;. In 2008, Sienkiewicz illustrated a story for &quot;The Nightmare Factory - Volume 2&quot; graphic novel. That same year, he inked the &quot;Reign in Hell&quot; limited series for DC. In 2010–2012, he inked several issues of Neal Adams&#x27; &quot;&quot; project for DC Comics.

In October 2012, Sienkiewicz teamed with fellow artists Klaus Janson and David W. Mack on the eight-issue Marvel mini-series &quot;&quot;. Regarding the contrast in art styles, Sienkiewicz related that it was deliberate, in order to &quot;give a very definite break from the &quot;everyday reality&quot; that Klaus&#x27; art is meant to portray, as well as the impression of a flashback.&quot;

In June 2014, Sienkiewicz was the guest of honor at ceremony for the 2014 Inkwell Awards at HeroesCon in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In April 2022, Sienkiewicz was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sienkiewicz would provide one of the covers to the softcover edition of the book.

===Other work===

In addition to his work in comics, Sienkiewicz has also worked in numerous other media, especially in the music and trading card industries. His artwork has been published in magazines including &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot;. In 1998, he collaborated with writer Martin I. Green to produce the children&#x27;s book &quot;Santa, My Life &amp; Times&quot;.

In 1989, Sienkiewicz painted the art for the &quot;Friendly Dictators&quot; card set published by Eclipse Comics which portrayed various foreign leaders such as Mobutu Sese Seko, Ferdinand Marcos, and Anastasio Somoza Debayle. This card set was followed by &quot;Coup d&#x27;etat : the assassination of John F. Kennedy&quot; (1990), a 36-card set including his meticulously detailed and stylized imagery of Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and Marilyn Monroe.

Sienkiewicz has illustrated cards for the &quot;&quot; collectible card game. In 2004, Sienkiewicz contributed to card art for VS System, a collectible card game published by Upper Deck Entertainment. In 1995, he illustrated &quot;Voodoo Child: The Illustrated Legend of Jimi Hendrix&quot; the biography of Jimi Hendrix by Martin I. Green. In 1996, he provided the artwork for the Bruce Cockburn album &quot;The Charity of Night&quot;. Additional Sienkiewicz album covers include RZA&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Digital in Stereo&quot; (1998), EPMD&#x27;s &quot;Business as Usual&quot; (1990), and Kid Cudi&#x27;s &quot;Man on the Moon: The End of Day&quot; (2009). Also in 2006, Sienkiewicz teamed with Neal Adams to create art for former Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters.

Sienkiewicz has worked on character design for animation. His work on the television series &quot;Where on Earth Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; received two Emmy Award nominations in 1995 and 1996. In 2006, Sienkiewicz designed the layout and art for &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; season one DVD set. He designed the cover art for the season three DVD and Blu-ray set.

<text>Odontites is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae.

==Phylogeny==
The phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. &quot;Odontites&quot; belongs to the core Rhinantheae. It is the sister genus to &quot;Bellardia&quot;, and then to &quot;Tozzia&quot; and &quot;Hedbergia&quot;. These taxa are closely related to the genus &quot;Euphrasia&quot;. In turn, these five genera share phylogenetic affinities with &quot;Bartsia&quot;.

==Conservation==
One of the &quot;Odontites&quot; species, &quot;O. granatensis&quot;, endemic to the Sierra Nevada in Spain, was so threatened that in 1993 only 1,500 plants survived in two locations. Due to conservation efforts the plant has made a comeback, numbering over 100,000 in 2006.

<text>Revive Adserver is an open-source advertising server that is licensed under the GNU General Public License. It features an integrated banner management interface and tracking system for gathering statistics. It used to be known under different names in the past, most recently as OpenX Source. In Sep 2013, OpenX Source was sold to Andrew Hill and rebranded Revive Adserver. The current code base for OpenX Enterprise and Revive Adserver (formerly known as OpenX Source) are completely separate.

The software enables web site administrators to rotate banners from both in-house advertisement campaigns as well as from paid or third-party sources, such as Google&#x27;s AdSense. Revive Adserver provides standard banner rotation, click tracking, zone-based ad selection, zone-based campaign targeting, direct ad selection, ad targeting (per browser, domain, language, etc.), ad capping and support for Adobe Flash banners.

==History==

OpenX Source began as phpAdsNew, a fork from a similar project called phpAds, created by Tobias Ratschiller in 1998. When the phpAds project came to a halt in 2000, Wim Godden decided to create phpAdsNew by expanding the project with new features. He hoped the &#x27;New&#x27; moniker would be temporary, lasting only until Ratschiller could update the phpAds website. Unfortunately, this only happened years later, after the name phpAdsNew was too well established to be changed.

During the time period between 2001 and 2002, Wim Godden led the phpAdsNew project and later received help from developers such as Niels Leenheer and Phil Hord, continually adding new features and improving the existing ones. After the release of version 1.9, a completely revised version 2.0 was created. This task was led by Niels Leenheer. The new version included many new features as well as a revised graphical user interface.

After gaining in popularity and earning support from the open-source community, the project was renamed to OpenAds. Features that were built for phpAdsNew 2.0 were also integrated into the latest OpenAds software, which at this point had reached version 2.3.

When version 2.4.4 was released in 2007, OpenAds was once again rebranded under a new name: OpenX. The final 2.4 version is v2.4.11 and was released in March 2009.

In 2011, the OpenX company disabled direct downloads of the software (a form must be filled out). Wim Godden subsequently made all GPL versions from phpAds 1.2.0 to OpenX 2.8.11 available.

Revive Adserver can be extended with help of plug-ins.

In 2020 and 2021, compromised Revive ad servers were used to deliver malvertising (advertisements which led victims to install malware). Researchers estimated number of victims to be in &quot;the tens if not hundreds of million of devices&quot;.

<text>Claudia Anne Irena Winkleman (born 15 January 1972) is an English broadcaster and writer. She has been nominated three times for the British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance for co-presenting the BBC One dancing competition show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; (2010–present). Winkleman received her fourth BAFTA nomination and first win for presenting the BBC One reality show &quot;The Traitors&quot; (2022–present)&quot;.&quot; She previously hosted the Saturday mid-mornings show on BBC Radio 2.

==Early life==
Claudia Anne Irena Winkleman was born into a Jewish family in the Westminster district of London on 15 January 1972, the daughter of author and journalist Eve Pollard and her husband Barry Winkleman. She grew up in the Hampstead area of London. Her parents divorced when she was three, and both re-married when she was seven. Her mother married newspaper editor Sir Nicholas Lloyd, while her father married children&#x27;s author Cindy Black. 

Her father&#x27;s marriage to Black gave her a younger half-sister, actress Sophie Winkleman, who married Lord Frederick Windsor. Her mother&#x27;s marriage to Lloyd gave her a younger half-brother, Oliver. She was educated at the City of London School for Girls and New Hall, Cambridge, where she obtained an MA in art history.

==Television career==
===1991–2000===
In 1992, she began appearing frequently in the long-running BBC series &quot;Holiday&quot;, and this continued throughout the mid-1990s. This culminated in a special documentary in which she travelled around the world for 34 days reporting from Japan, India, Costa Rica and Dubai. Throughout this period, she appeared as a reporter on other shows, particularly &quot;This Morning&quot; interviewing various celebrities. During the late 1990s, Winkleman presented a number of programmes on smaller digital channels. She had a stint on the cable channel L!VE TV, but soon left to pursue other projects. In 1996, Winkleman hosted Granada programmes &quot;God&#x27;s Gift&quot; (taking over from Davina McCall) and &quot;Pyjama Party&quot; (co-hosted with Katie Puckrik and Michelle Kelly).

Winkleman also presented a number of gameshows including the dating show &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, LWT show &quot;Talking Telephone Numbers&quot;, the second series of Granada TV show &quot;God&#x27;s Gift&quot; and &quot;Fanorama&quot;. In 1997 she was the co-host of children&#x27;s Saturday morning TV show &quot;Tricky&quot;. She was also an occasional team captain on a gameshow called &quot;HeadJam&quot;, hosted by Vernon Kay.

===2001–2006===
Winkleman&#x27;s first major television job was in 2001, on the regional discussion programme &quot;Central Weekend&quot;. Between 2002 and 2004, Winkleman began her first daily TV role when she hosted the BBC Three Entertainment update show &quot;Liquid News&quot;, taking over from Christopher Price on the now defunct BBC Choice. She shared the presenting duties with Colin Paterson, and later Paddy O&#x27;Connell. The show featured celebrity interviews.

In 2003, &quot;Fame Academy&quot; appointed Winkleman to present a daily update show on BBC Three, in conjunction with its second series. She repeated the show in 2005 for the much shorter celebrity version &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot;. Also in 2005, Winkleman co-hosted &quot;The House of Tiny Tearaways&quot;, a BBC Three reality TV show. She also began hosting &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot;, a supplementary programme to &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, taking over from Justin Lee-Collins.

Winkleman then presented several more reality shows including &quot;End of Story&quot; and &quot;Art School&quot;.

===2007–2012===
Winkleman presented many prime time programmes. In 2007, she took over from Cat Deeley as the main host for the third series of &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot;, co-hosting with Patrick Kielty. She co-hosted the inaugural Eurovision Dance Contest 2007 alongside Graham Norton for BBC One in September of that year and again in 2008. She co-presented the UK selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 called &quot;&quot;, this time accompanied by Eurovision stalwart Terry Wogan. In March 2008, Winkleman rekindled her partnership with Kielty when the pair hosted the final leg of &quot;Sport Relief 2008&quot;.

In 2007, Winkleman was the face of Sky Movie Premiere&#x27;s coverage of the 79th Academy Awards, repeating it for the 80th Academy Awards in 2008. The show was broadcast live in conjunction with the ceremony itself, running right through the night into the early hours of the morning. Winkleman has made many guest appearances on panel and talk shows, including: &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; and &quot;Lily Allen and Friends&quot;. In February 2008, she appeared on the British version of the comedy improvisational show &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, hosted by Paul Merton.

Winkleman narrated the 2008 BBC Three show &quot;Glamour Girls&quot;, a documentary series about glamour modelling in Britain.

In March 2009, Winkleman was announced as the host of the new series of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; on ITV1. She fronted the nightly show live from the restaurant in East London in its fourth series in the spring. On 14 November 2009, she appeared on the main show of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; to present backstage, due to main presenter Bruce Forsyth being on sick leave. She co-hosted the show with Tess Daly and guest presenter Ronnie Corbett.

On 29 March 2010, she was named as one of the new co-presenters of &quot;the Film programme&quot;, replacing Jonathan Ross. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated, through her recent hosting of Sky Television&#x27;s coverage of The Oscars, Winkleman had &quot;proved both a passionate and engaging advocate of cinema&quot;, while her husband Kris Thykier is a film producer with credits on several mainstream releases.

===Since 2013===

On 2 April 2013, Winkleman began presenting the BBC Two sewing competition &quot;The Great British Sewing Bee&quot;, until 2016. The show went off air for 2017, but was brought back in 2018, with Joe Lycett replacing Winkleman as presenter. 

In 2015, she appeared on &quot;The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz&quot;. In May 2015, she appeared on an episode of &quot;Watchdog&quot; on BBC One in which she discussed, during a segment on dangerous Halloween costumes, that the previous year her daughter had been badly burned when the costume she was wearing caught fire. In November 2016, Winkleman presented the one-off BBC special &quot;Bublé at the BBC&quot; with Michael Bublé.

From 2018, she presented &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Home Cook&quot; and &quot;The Makeover Show&quot; for BBC One. In May 2018, Winkleman co-presented &quot;The Biggest Weekend&quot; on BBC Two and BBC Radio 2.

In 2022, she assumed the hosting duties for the widely acclaimed BBC reality gameshow &#x27;The Traitors UK,&#x27; where contestants navigate challenges testing loyalty and deception in a thrilling competition. A second series was announced in February 2023 with Winkleman returning as host, premiering on 3 January 2024.
Winkleman returned to host the third series, premiering on 1 January 2025.

In 2023, Winkleman hosted a five-part Channel 4 competition show &quot;The Piano&quot; which gave amateur pianists the chance to perform at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall. It was announced that the show had been renewed for a second and third series, a Christmas special, and a documentary focusing on the winner of the first series, Lucy Illingworth.

===&quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;===

&quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; was devised as a companion show to run conjoined with the second series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, and continues to run to date. It follows a similar format to the one Winkleman made popular on &quot;Fame Academy&quot;, and sees the presenter deliberating and dissecting the ins and outs of the main competition, accompanied by an array of dance experts, assorted guests and the competitors themselves. The show is aired every weekday at 6:30 pm on BBC Two throughout the course of the series.

&quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot; was originally hosted by Winkleman since its inception. In 2011, former contestant Zoe Ball took over as host from Winkleman.

In 2010, Winkleman became co-host of the Sunday night results show of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, presenting alongside Tess Daly. In 2014, Winkleman&#x27;s role on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; expanded to presenting the main show, following the departure of Bruce Forsyth.

==Writing==
Winkleman started her journalism career as a travel writer, writing columns about her various worldwide excursions. She did so in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;, but also contributed to the free daily London paper &quot;Metro&quot; in a similar capacity. As her television career and family evolved, she travelled less, and began to write more general work, opinion-led lifestyle journalism about womanhood, sex and relationships. She wrote for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Tatler&quot; amongst others. Between 2005 and 2008, she wrote a regular weekly column for &quot;The Independent&quot; called &quot;Take It From Me&quot;.

==Radio work==
In April and May 2008, Winkleman hosted a six-part comedy quiz series taking a humorous look into the week&#x27;s celebrity gossip, called &quot;Hot Gossip&quot;. The show was broadcast on a Saturday afternoon on BBC Radio 2; points were awarded to those who dished out dirt. The show featured pundits including Will Smith, Phil Nichol, Jo Caulfield, Rufus Hound and Jonathan Ross&#x27; brother, Paul.

She hosted a weekly show on BBC Radio 2 every Friday night between 10pm and midnight called &quot;Claudia Winkleman&#x27;s Arts Show&quot; consisting of interviews with people from the arts world, as well as reviews and debate. In July 2010, Winkleman sat in for Dermot O&#x27;Leary. She covered for Ken Bruce on several occasions from 2012 until 2014.

In April 2016, she began presenting her own Sunday night show on BBC Radio 2 called &quot;Claudia on Sunday&quot; from 7 to 9pm. In June 2017, Winkleman covered for &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; from 2 to 5pm. 

In 2020, &quot;Claudia on Sunday&quot; was displaced from the schedules and subsequently ended due to the COVID pandemic. It was announced on 23 November 2020 that Winkleman had taken over the Saturday mid-morning slot on BBC Radio 2 from Graham Norton. Winkleman&#x27;s last Saturday morning show was broadcast on 23 March 2024, with Romesh Ranganathan taking over.

==Charity==

In 2007, Winkleman answered telephones at the BT Tower for the Disasters Emergency Committee in response to humanitarian crisis in Darfur. In May 2007, she helped relaunch The National Missing Persons Campaign, and also supported a Christmas campaign by the charity Refuge, which aimed to stop domestic violence.

In June 2008, Winkleman was depicted in &quot;Heat&quot; magazine with no make-up on as part of a stand against the excessive airbrushing of prominent women, which she described as &quot;pretty terrifying&quot;.
On 18 March 2011, Winkleman was one of the presenters of BBC&#x27;s Comic Relief.

In 2012, Winkleman was one of the judges and the host of the FilmNation shorts at the British Film Institute, which (as part of the Cultural Olympiad for the 2012 Summer Olympics) encouraged people aged 14–25 to get involved in filmmaking.

== Personal life ==
In June 2000, Winkleman married film producer Kris Thykier at Marylebone Town Hall. They have three children together.

On 31 October 2014, Winkleman&#x27;s eight-year-old daughter was taken to hospital after being seriously injured when her Halloween costume caught fire. Winkleman stated that the costume had brushed against a lit candle in a pumpkin. The incident prompted the UK government to tighten the flame retardant standards of Halloween costumes.

Her half-sister, Sophie, married into the British royal family when she became the wife of Lord Frederick Windsor, the son of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent.

In April 2024, satirical London mayoral candidate Count Binface stated in his manifesto that he would honour Winkleman by declaring her signature fringe Grade I listed; however, he was not elected, finishing in 11th place out of 13 candidates with 24,260 votes (1% of the overall votes).

<doc id="709718" wikidata="Q1934461" url="?curid=709718" title="The Motors">
<text>The Motors were a British pub rock band formed in London in 1977 by former Ducks Deluxe members Nick Garvey and Andy McMaster together with guitarist Rob Hendry (who was replaced in May 1977 by Bram Tchaikovsky) and drummer Ricky Slaughter. Their biggest success was with the McMaster-penned song &quot;Airport&quot;, a number 4 UK hit single in 1978.

== History ==
Having left Ducks Deluxe in early 1975, Garvey formed a band called The Snakes with Slaughter and vocalist Robert Gotobed, who would later form the post-punk band Wire. The group released only one single before splitting up. At the suggestion of his manager, Richard Ogden, Garvey formed his own band. He began recording demos with former bandmate Andy McMaster in January 1977. The Motors&#x27; debut live performance was at the Marquee Club in March 1977, and they recorded three songs for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show the same month (22 March 1977).

By May they had been signed to Virgin Records and recorded material for another John Peel session on 12 September of that year. The Motors&#x27; original recording line-up released two albums, both of which met with modest success; &quot;1&quot; released in October 1977 and &quot;Approved by the Motors&quot; the following year.

Their first single &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot;, which was released in September 1977 reached number 42 in the UK Singles Chart. Two other sizeable hits followed. In 1978, the band released &quot;Airport&quot; – which proved to be the band&#x27;s biggest seller – and which peaked at number 4. The song was also a minor hit in the United States. The follow-up, &quot;Forget About You&quot;, was released two months later.

The Garvey/McMaster/Tchaikovsky/Slaughter line-up split when Tchaikovsky left after they played at the Reading Rock Festival on 28 August 1978. It would become The Motors’ final UK concert. They played as first support to Status Quo. Slaughter also left the group soon afterwards. Tchaikovsky would subsequently release three solo albums, the first of which took him into the American Top 40 with the power pop song &quot;Girl of My Dreams&quot;.

Following the departure of Tchaikovsky and Slaughter, bassist Martin Ace and drummer Terry Williams were recruited to fill in the Motors&#x27; studio line-up. Martin and Terry had together made up the rhythm section for 1970s rockers Man; Martin later relaunched Man whilst Terry joined Rockpile and later had a stint with Dire Straits.

Following the release of The Motors&#x27; third album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Tenement Steps&quot;, which contained the minor chart hit &quot;Love and Loneliness&quot;, Garvey and McMaster finally announced that they had dissolved the group.

== After The Motors ==

Tchaikovsky was – if briefly – the most visible former member of the group thanks to his solo career. His band toured with The Joe Perry Project, The Cars and Alice Cooper and performed on Don Kirshner&#x27;s syndicated &quot;Rock Concert&quot; television programme. Following the release of his final solo album (1981&#x27;s &quot;Funland&quot;, produced by Garvey) he operated a recording studio during the 1980s and occasionally played blues gigs in the early 1990s. Garvey released one solo album (1982&#x27;s &quot;Blue Skies&quot;) following the final split with McMaster and did session work with Paul McCartney and others through the 1980s. He produced (with the band) the third album by The Sunnyboys, &quot;Get Some Fun&quot;, released in 1984. McMaster is reported to still be recording music and living in a small town in the southeast of England, and Slaughter continued to play with a number of bands through the 1980s, including Fallen Angels, which included Knox, former lead vocalist of The Vibrators (and Slaughter&#x27;s cousin).

The band&#x27;s three albums were reissued on 27 March 2006 in the UK with a variety of live tracks, B-sides and remixes. These were on the Captain Oi! label, with sleeve notes by Record Collector&#x27;s Joe Geesin and quotes from guitarist Nick Garvey.

Of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s three solo albums, the first two &quot;Strange Man Changed Man&quot; and &quot;The Russians Are Coming&quot; were released on CD in 1998 as part of a &quot;British Rock&quot; reissue series, WEA Japan re-released both using original master tapes and artwork. In addition to the original artwork and liner notes, each CD contained extensive historical information, song lyrics and musical commentary (albeit in Japanese). These CDs were only available in Japan and are now out of production.

An expanded version of &quot;Stranger Man Changed Man&quot; has appeared on CD, with 21 tracks and includes rare b-sides and live cuts. The audio for the reissue of &quot;Strange Man Changed Man&quot; is sourced from vinyl LPs and 45s and not the original master tapes. In December 2007, &quot;Strange Man Changed Man&quot; was issued on Compact Disc in the US by Hip-O Select with full artwork and master tapes sequenced for the original US album release. This edition has a track order from the UK LP and also different from the 1998 Japanese CD.

Garvey&#x27;s one solo album, &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, has yet to be reissued in any form. Garvey appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 2001 in the Identity Parade round.

<text>George Washington Cass (March 12, 1810 – March 21, 1888) was an American industrialist and president of the Northern Pacific Railway.

== Family ==
George Washington Cass was born near Dresden, Ohio, March 12, 1810, to George W. and Sophia (Lord) Cass. He married Louisa Dawson in 1842.

== Education ==
Cass attended Detroit Academy, 1824 to 1827, in Detroit, Michigan, while living with his uncle Lewis Cass, governor, Michigan Territory. He then graduated from U.S. Military Academy, West Point, New York, class of 1832.

== Career ==
Cass joined United States Army Corps of Engineers circa 1832, working on improvements to the Cumberland Road. Cass helped design Dunlap&#x27;s Creek Bridge, the first cast iron arch bridge in the United States at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, later designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Cass left the Army as a first lieutenant in 1836 and settled into private business in Brownsville, Pennsylvania.

From 1836 to 1855 Cass organized steamboat and stagecoach lines. Due to his efforts, he was appointed president of Adams &amp; Co., predecessor to Adams Express. He expanded the Boston-based shipping company to points as far away as St. Louis, Missouri, and Richmond, Virginia.

From Adams, Cass went into railroading, becoming president of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1856, and the successor Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad (PFW&amp;C) in 1857. He held the latter position until 1883. During this period the PFW&amp;C became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Cass joined the Northern Pacific Railway as a director in 1867, four years before the company laid its first rail near Carlton, Minnesota. He was appointed president in 1872, and saw the company through the difficult years following the failure of Jay Cooke and Company and the Panic of 1873. He remained as president until 1875, when the company succumbed to its first bankruptcy. Cass was named its receiver and remained until Frederick Billings reorganized the company circa 1878. He died March 21, 1888, in New York City.

==Legacy==
Cass County, North Dakota was named after him, as was the city of Casselton, North Dakota.

<doc id="709720" wikidata="Q3566461" url="?curid=709720" title="Warthog Games">
<text>Warthog Games Limited, or Warthog plc, was a British video game developer, located in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, with studios in Sweden and the United States.

The developer later developed titles as Gizmondo Europe, before the company disbanded; key staff formed Embryonic Studios and the brand was relaunched by CFAO as Warthog Entertainment.

==Subsidiaries==
*Warthog: Texas: A susidiary in Austin, Texas, USA. In February 5, 2003, Warthog plc announced the acquisition of Fever Pitch Studios. In February 6, 2003, Fever Pitch Studios was renamed to Warthog: Texas.
*Warthog Sweden/42-bit AB: Originally Atod AB, and became Warthog Sweden/42-bit AB after being acquired in 2002.
*Zed Two: Acquired in 2002.

==History==
Warthog was founded in April 1997, the core of the development team composed of ex-Electronic Arts personnel responsible for, amongst other titles, the hit &quot;Privateer 2: The Darkening&quot;. With this as the basis, Warthog began to develop something of a speciality in space-flight sims, with follow-up titles &quot;Starlancer&quot; (which sold over 330,000 units, mainly on PC) and &quot;Star Trek: Invasion&quot; (achieving over 230,000 units on PlayStation). Since 1999, the company also developed expertise in children&#x27;s titles, with releases based upon well known franchises such as &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Asterix&quot;. Warthog was one of the companies considered to develop the game engine for BBC&#x27;s game show &quot;FightBox&quot;.

In 2004, Warthog itself was acquired by Tiger Telematics and became a part of Gizmondo Studios. Collectively, the Cheadle and newly acquired Sweden studios became known as Gizmondo Europe, with the recently acquired Warthog Texas becoming Gizmondo Texas. Their focus from then on would be on the Gizmondo handheld console.

After Gizmondo went bankrupt, key staff from the original team established a new development company, Embryonic Studios.

Warthog were affiliated with the Manchester Metropolitan University course Computer Games Technology. They provided feedback on course content and a selection of placement jobs for third-year students.

==List of games==

===Cancelled titles===
*&quot;BattleBots&quot;
*&quot;Momma Can I Mow the Lawn&quot;
*&quot;Johnny Whatever&quot;
*&quot;X10&quot;
*&quot;Conquest 2: The Vyrium Uprising&quot;
*&quot;Wrath &amp; Skeller&quot;
*&quot;Fallen Kingdoms&quot;

&quot;BattleBots&quot; was a video game based on the &quot;BattleBots&quot; license for PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It got fairly far in development. Many screenshots were released to media outlets and it obtained a rating from the ESRB, but it was ultimately cancelled after the show was cancelled. However, prototypes of the game were sold on the BattleBots website for $299.98. Additionally, photographic evidence of the game being played proves that there are copies in existence, so the game could be brought to the Internet in the form of a ROM. It has been the dream of lead designer Zuby Ahmed to one day recreate this canceled game.

&quot;Momma Can I Mow The Lawn&quot; is a video game which started off in development for formats such as the PlayStation 2, but after the developer Warthog Games was purchased by Tiger Telematics to produce titles for the Gizmondo handheld console, it was moved to the Gizmondo. Tiger Telematics went bankrupt in 2006 when the Gizmondo was discontinued, and the status of this game is publicly unknown. It was most likely cancelled.

&quot;Johnny Whatever&quot; was announced on 20 July 2004 but was later cancelled. It was planned as an action game in a third-person environment, following a punk hero in a futuristic city who used his guitar as his weapon against villains. It started off in development for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but became a Gizmondo exclusive when the developer was purchased by Tiger Telematics, makers of the Gizmondo. The game was scheduled for a September 2006 release. A demo for the Gizmondo was made, but it was never released. Upon liquidation of Tiger Telematics and their UK subsidiary Gizmondo Europe in February 2006, the ownership of Johnny Whatever was sold back to the CEO of Warthog Games.

<text>Riḍván (; Bahá&#x27;í orthography: Rezván, ) is a twelve-day festival in the Bahá&#x27;í Faith commemorating Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s declaration that he was a Manifestation of God. In the Bahá&#x27;í calendar, it begins at sunset on the 13th of Jalál, which translates to the 20th or 21 April, depending on the date of the March equinox (exactly one month on the Gregorian calendar after the equinox). In 2025, it begins in the evening of 20 April. On the first, ninth and twelfth days of Ridván, work and school should be suspended.

&quot;Riḍwān&quot; is named for the Garden of Ridván, Baghdad, where Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh stayed for twelve days after the Ottoman Empire exiled him from the city before he journeyed to Constantinople.

It is the holiest Bahá&#x27;í festival, and is also referred to as the &quot;Most Great Festival&quot; and the &quot;King of Festivals&quot;.

==History==
===Context===
In 1844 Ali-Muhammad of Shiraz proclaimed that he was the Báb (Arabic for &#x27;Gate&#x27;), after a Twelver Shi&#x27;i religious concept. His followers were therefore known as Bábís. The Báb&#x27;s writings introduced the concept of &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot;, a Messianic figure whose coming, according to Bahá&#x27;ís, was announced in the scriptures of all of the world&#x27;s great religions.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh claimed that his mission as the Promised One of the Báb, was revealed to him in 1852 while imprisoned in the prison known as the Black Pit of Qajar Iran. After his release from the Black Pit, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh was banished from Qajar territory and he settled in Baghdad, which became the centre of Bábí activity. Although he did not openly declare this prophetic mandate, he increasingly became the leader of the Bábí community.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s rising prominence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in the ulema and the Qajar government. They were eventually successful in having the Ottoman government summon Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh from Baghdad to Istanbul.

===Najibiyyih garden===
Before Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh left for Constantinople, many visitors came to visit him. To allow his family to prepare for the trip, and to be able to receive all these visitors, he decided to move to the Garden of Ridwan across the Tigris from Baghdad. He entered the garden on 22 April 1863 (31 days after Nawrúz, which usually occurs on 21 March) accompanied by his sons ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Mírzá Mihdí and Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí, his secretary Mirza Aqa Jan, and some others, and stayed there for eleven days.

After he arrived in the garden, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh announced his mission and station for the first time to a small group of family and friends. The exact nature and details of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s declaration are unknown. Bahíyyih Khánum is reported to have said that Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh stated his claim to his son ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá and four others. While some Bábís had come to the realization that Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh was claiming to be the Promised One through the many remarks and allusions that he had made during his final few months in Baghdad, it appears that most other Bábís were unaware of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s claim until a few years later while he was in Edirne.

For the next eleven days Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh received visitors including the governor of Baghdad. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s family was not able to join him until 30 April, the ninth day, since the river had risen and made travel to the garden difficult though lasting only nine days was a comparatively mild flooding of the river. On the twelfth day of their stay in the garden, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and his family left the garden and started on their journey to Constantinople.

==Festival==
In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, written during 1873, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh ordains Ridván as one of two &quot;Most Great Festivals&quot;, along with the Declaration of the Báb. He then specified the first, ninth, and twelfth days to be holy days; these days mark the days of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s arrival, the arrival of his family and their departure from the Ridván garden, respectively.

The Festival of Ridván is observed according to the Bahá&#x27;í calendar, and begins on the thirty-second day of the Bahá&#x27;í year, which falls on 20 or 21 April. The festival properly starts at two hours before sunset on that day, which symbolises the time that Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh entered the garden. On the first, ninth, and twelfth days, which are Bahá&#x27;í Holy Days, work is prohibited. Currently, the three holy days are usually observed with a community gathering where prayers are shared, followed by a celebration.

==Significance==

The time that Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh spent at the Garden of Ridván in April 1863, and the associated festival and celebration, has a very large significance for Bahá&#x27;ís. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh calls it one of two &quot;Most Great Festivals&quot; and describes the first day as &quot;the Day of supreme felicity&quot; and he then describes the Garden of Ridvan as &quot;the Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendours of his Name, the All-Merciful&quot;.

The festival is significant because of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s private declaration to a few followers that he was &quot;Him Whom God shall make manifest&quot; and a Manifestation of God, and thus it forms the beginning point of Bahá&#x27;ism distinct from Bábism It is also significant because Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh left his house in Baghdad, which he designated the &quot;Most Great House&quot;, to enter the Garden of Ridván. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh compares this move from the Most Great House to the Garden of Ridwan to Muhammad&#x27;s Hijrah.

Furthermore, during Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s first day in the garden, he made three further announcements: (1) abrogating religious war, which was permitted under certain conditions in Islam and the Bábí faith; (2) that there would not be another Manifestation of God for another 1000 years; and (3) that all the names of God were fully manifest in all things. These statements appear in a text written some years after 1863, which has been included in the compilation &quot;Days of Remembrance&quot; (section 9). Nader Saiedi states that these three principles are &quot;affirmed, expounded, and institutionalized&quot; in Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s , which was completed in 1873.

==Related texts==
Throughout his life, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh wrote several tablets and prayers on the occasion of Ridván, among which are the following.

* (&quot;Tablet of the Maid of Heaven&quot;) 
* (&quot;Tablet of the Lover and the Beloved&quot;)
* ( &quot;of the Pen&quot;)

These and several others are published in the volume titled &quot;Days of Remembrance&quot;.

==Bahá&#x27;í elections==
The Ridván period is also the time when Bahá&#x27;í elections for the local and national Spiritual Assemblies take place every year, as well as the election of the Universal House of Justice, every five years.

==Ridván messages==
Annually, during Ridván, the Universal House of Justice sends a &#x27;Ridván message&#x27; to the worldwide Bahá&#x27;í community, which generally looks back on the previous year, and provides further guidance for the coming year.

<text>The Big River is a tributary of the Coast Fork Willamette River, approximately long, in western Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of the Calapooya Mountains south of Eugene.

It rises in northern Douglas County, northwest of Huckleberry Mountain, approximately south-southeast of Cottage Grove at . It flows northwest through Lane County to form the Coast Fork of the Willamette at its confluence with the Little River, about south of Cottage Grove at 

==Course==
Flowing northwest from the northern flanks of the Calapooya Mountains in Douglas County, Big River enters Lane County about downstream from the source. Box Canyon enters from the right at about river mile (RM) 9 or river kilometer (RK) 14. Big River receives Boulder Creek from the left, then Edwards Creek enters from the right at about RM 6 (RK 10). After receiving Bar Creek from the left and Martin Creek from the right, Big River meets Little River to form the Coast Fork Willamette River about from where the larger stream meets the Middle Fork Willamette River to form the Willamette River.

<text>In United States law, depraved-heart murder, also known as depraved-indifference murder, is a type of murder where an individual acts with a &quot; indifference&quot; to human life and where such acts result in a death, despite that individual not explicitly intending to kill. In a depraved-heart murder, defendants commit an act even though they know their act runs an unusually high risk of causing death or serious bodily harm to a person. If the risk of death or bodily harm is great enough, ignoring it demonstrates a &quot;depraved indifference&quot; to human life and the resulting death is considered to have been committed with malice aforethought. In some states, depraved-heart killings constitute second-degree murder, while in others, the act would be charged with &quot;wanton murder&quot;, varying degrees of manslaughter, or third-degree murder.

If no death results, such an act would generally constitute reckless endangerment (sometimes known as &quot;culpable negligence&quot;) and possibly other crimes, such as assault.

It [&quot;depraved heart&quot; murder] is the form [of murder] that establishes that the wilful doing of a dangerous and reckless act with wanton indifference to the consequences and perils involved is just as blameworthy, and just as worthy of punishment, when the harmful result ensues as is the express intent to kill itself. This highly blameworthy state of mind is not one of mere negligence... It is not merely one even of gross criminal negligence... It involves rather the deliberate perpetration of a knowingly dangerous act with reckless and wanton unconcern and indifference as to whether anyone is harmed or not. The common law treats such a state of mind as just as blameworthy, just as anti-social and, therefore, just as truly murderous as the specific intents to kill and to harm.

The common law punishes unintentional homicide as murder if the defendant commits an act of gross recklessness. A classic example of depraved-heart murder under the common law is in the case &quot;Commonwealth v. Malone&quot;, a Pennsylvania case in which the court affirmed the second-degree murder conviction of a teenager for a death arising from a game of modified Russian roulette in which each player pointed and fired the gun at the other, eventually resulting in the death of one of them.

==Under the Model Penal Code==
Depraved-heart murder is recognized in the Model Penal Code § 210.2(1)(b). The Model Penal Code considers unintentional killing to constitute murder when the conduct of the defendant manifests &quot;extreme indifference to the value of human life&quot;.

==International equivalents==
===Canada===
The Canadian Criminal Code categorises murder as first- and second-degree for sentencing purposes. However, the Supreme Court of Canada held that murder requires, at minimum, subjective knowledge that death is a likely consequence of the defendant&#x27;s actions. 

Section 229(a)(ii) of the Canadian Criminal Code is most closely analogous to depraved-heart murder, applying where the defendant intended to cause bodily harm to the deceased that he subjectively knew was likely to cause death, and was reckless as to the risk of death.

===England and Wales===
Murder is not classified into degrees in England and Wales, unlike in Canada, but sentences are more severe (always life, but with a longer period when the offender is ineligible for parole) in cases where there are more aggravating than mitigating factors. Murder requires intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm; recklessness as to harm will not suffice. In a case where death results from recklessness, the defendant will be guilty of manslaughter.

===Germany===
A similar concept is , also called &quot;dolus eventualis&quot; or &quot;bedingter Vorsatz&quot; (literally: &quot;conditional intent&quot;). Under this concept, a court can treat the result of a criminal act as intentional if the defendant did not explicitly intend this result, but realized it was not unlikely and knowingly accepted this risk.

While &quot;Eventualvorsatz&quot; can apply to any crime, it is usually only applied in cases involving bodily harm or murder. Typical cases where courts recognized &quot;Eventualvorsatz&quot; (in this case for murder) include setting fire to an inhabited house and reckless speeding in an urban area.

==Well-known cases==
=== 1946 Russian roulette case ===
In the 1946 case, &quot;Commonwealth v. Malone&quot;, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the conviction of a teenager on the charge of second degree murder using the depraved-heart doctrine. The teenager in question had set up a game of Russian roulette which ended in the death of another teenager, a friend of the defendant. When tried for the crime of murder, his defense argued that since the defendant had no intent to kill, he could not be convicted of murder. The prosecution successfully argued using the depraved-heart doctrine that the defendant&#x27;s recklessness and carelessness amounted to a level of negligence sufficient to serve as evidence of criminally culpable intent.

=== 2015 death of Freddie Gray ===

Caesar Goodson, Jr., a Baltimore police officer, was charged on May 21, 2015, with second-degree depraved heart murder for his alleged involvement in the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray while in police custody. Gray died several days after he was arrested and driven in a police van to jail. The van was shown on video during the trial to have been driven normally, but was alleged to have been driven aggressively with no regard for the safety of the prisoner, who was not adequately secured for safety. Further, the prisoner was shackled, preventing him from protecting himself. The prosecution alleged that the injuries were inflicted during the ride and that pleas for medical attention were ignored. Officer Goodson was charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder before the internal investigation was completed. He was found not guilty on June 23, 2016. Of the six officers charged, three were acquitted, and charges were dropped against the remaining three.

=== Murder of George Floyd===
The murder of George Floyd, an African-American man, occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota on May 25, 2020. Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, kept his knee on Floyd&#x27;s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, 2 minutes and 53 seconds of which occurred after Floyd became unresponsive, according to the criminal complaint filed against Chauvin. Floyd was handcuffed and lying prone on the road throughout that time. Officers Thomas K. Lane, Tou Thao, and J. Alexander Kueng participated in Floyd&#x27;s arrest, with Kueng holding Floyd’s back, Lane holding his legs, and Thao looking on as he stood nearby. Chauvin was charged with third-degree depraved heart murder under Minnesota law on May 29, 2020. On April 20, 2021 Chauvin was convicted of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, while the other officers pled guilty for various charges related to the murder.

<text>The Coast Fork Willamette River is one of two forks that unite to form the Willamette River in western Oregon in the United States. It is about long, draining an area of the mountains at the south end of the Willamette Valley south of Eugene.

==Course==
The Coast Fork Willamette River is formed in southwestern Lane County, in the Calapooya Mountains, by the confluence of the Little River and the Big River. The Coast Fork flows north through the mountains, through the Cottage Grove Lake reservoir, to Cottage Grove, where it receives the Row River from the southeast. It continues north past Creswell and joins the Middle Fork from the south, about southeast of Eugene, to form the Willamette.

<text>Blå Jungfrun, also known as &quot;Blåkulla&quot;, in English sometimes rendered literally as The Blue Maiden is a Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. It is situated in the Kalmar Strait, between the mainland province of Småland and the island province of Öland. Administratively, the uninhabited island is part of the municipality of Oskarshamn and covers an area of approximately with a mean height above sea level of . Home to black guillemots and a Swedish National Park since 1926, freedom to roam at Blå Jungfrun is limited with visitors prohibited from staying overnight on the island or making fires.

The island consists partly of bare rock with the remainder covered in dense hardwood forest. There are several caves and an ancient stone labyrinth from which it is forbidden to remove stones.

Geologically the island is an ancient inselberg rising from the Sub-Cambrian peneplain. After its formation in the Precambrian, Blå Jungfrun was buried in sandstone, which protected it from any further erosion, until it was finally freed from its sandstone cover in geologically recent times. In 2014 the island became object of archeological interest when a group of researchers discovered a cultural layer after probating the soil. At the time the authorities had given them the permission to only operate in a small area and could not take samples; three years later they were able to recover shards made out of quartz, which date to the Stone Age and had been probably produced by a settlement of hunter-gatherers. The exact age of the site remains uncertain, but it is estimated to have existed around 8500BC, about 10,000 years ago.

== Legends ==

The island plays an important role in Swedish folklore, where it is viewed as an evil and magical place. The name Blå Jungfrun was originally used by sailors to avoid provoking the evil spirits who dwelt on the island. According to a widespread belief, related already by Olaus Magnus in 1555, witches meet there each Maundy Thursday. Carl Linnaeus, who visited the island in 1741, was sceptical:
&quot;Women and fairy-tales ... generally say that all witches will go here (truly a rather difficult journey) each Maundy Thursday; but those who have visited the place once are not likely to return, and should find out the reason for the fable: If any place in the world looks hideous, this is surely one of the most cruel.&quot;

==Modern traditions==
In Sweden and Swedish-speaking parts of Finland, to commemorate the travel of witches to the legendary Blåkulla (synonymous in some traditions with Blå Jungfrun), children dress as witches, old women, and old men on Easter and go door-to-door for treats similar to the trick-or-treating tradition of Halloween. The children sometimes present hand-made cards and other greetings.

== Park establishment and tourism ==
Between 1904 and 1925 the red granite of Blå Jungfrun was extracted in three quarries on the south of the island. It was exported chiefly to Germany as decorative stone. The destruction led to efforts to protect the island. A donation from the Swedish entrepreneur Torsten Kreuger made it possible to acquire the island and stop the quarrying. The national park was established on February5, 1926 by the Government of Sweden.

In summer, the island can be visited by tour boats from Oskarshamn or from Byxelkrok. Regular trips began in the 1950s. A park guide on Blå Jungfrun informs the visitors about the national park and its regulations. A visit to the island lasts for around 3,5 hours.

<doc id="709783" wikidata="Q1158962" url="?curid=709783" title="Strategy-stealing argument">
<text>In combinatorial game theory, the strategy-stealing argument is a general argument that shows, for many two-player games, that the second player cannot have a guaranteed winning strategy. The strategy-stealing argument applies to any symmetric game (one in which either player has the same set of available moves with the same results, so that the first player can &quot;use&quot; the second player&#x27;s strategy) in which an extra move can never be a disadvantage. A key property of a strategy-stealing argument is that it proves that the first player can win (or possibly draw) the game without actually constructing such a strategy. So, although it might prove the existence of a winning strategy, the proof gives no information about what that strategy is.

The argument works by obtaining a contradiction. A winning strategy is assumed to exist for the second player, who is using it. But then, roughly speaking, after making an arbitrary first move – which by the conditions above is not a disadvantage – the first player may then also play according to this winning strategy. The result is that both players are guaranteed to win – which is absurd, thus contradicting the assumption that such a strategy exists.

Strategy-stealing was invented by John Nash in the 1940s to show that the game of hex is always a first-player win, as ties are not possible in this game. However, Nash did not publish this method, and József Beck credits its first publication to Alfred W. Hales and Robert I. Jewett, in the 1963 paper on tic-tac-toe in which they also proved the Hales–Jewett theorem. Other examples of games to which the argument applies include the &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-games such as gomoku. In the game of Chomp strategy stealing shows that the first player has a winning strategy in any rectangular board (other than 1x1). In the game of Sylver coinage, strategy stealing has been used to show that the first player can win in certain positions called &quot;enders&quot;. In all of these examples the proof reveals nothing about the actual strategy.

== Example ==
A strategy-stealing argument can be used on the example of the game of tic-tac-toe, for a board and winning rows of any size. Suppose that the second player (P2) is using a strategy &quot;S&quot; which guarantees a win. The first player (P1) places an X in an arbitrary position. P2 responds by placing an O according to &quot;S&quot;. But if P1 ignores the first random X, P1 is now in the same situation as P2 on P2&#x27;s first move: a single enemy piece on the board. P1 may therefore make a move according to &quot;S&quot; – that is, unless &quot;S&quot; calls for another X to be placed where the ignored X is already placed. But in this case, P1 may simply place an X in some other random position on the board, the net effect of which will be that one X is in the position demanded by &quot;S&quot;, while another is in a random position, and becomes the new ignored piece, leaving the situation as before. Continuing in this way, &quot;S&quot; is, by hypothesis, guaranteed to produce a winning position (with an additional ignored X of no consequence). But then P2 has lost – contradicting the supposition that P2 had a guaranteed winning strategy. Such a winning strategy for P2, therefore, does not exist, and tic-tac-toe is either a forced win for P1 or a tie. (Further analysis shows it is in fact a tie.)

The same proof holds for any strong positional game.

== Chess ==
There is a class of chess positions called Zugzwang in which the player obligated to move would prefer to &quot;pass&quot; if this were allowed. Because of this, the strategy-stealing argument cannot be applied to chess. It is not currently known whether White or Black can force a win with optimal play, or if both players can force a draw. However, virtually all students of chess consider White&#x27;s first move to be an advantage and White wins more often than black in high-level games.

== Go ==
In Go passing is allowed. When the starting position is symmetrical (empty board, neither player has any points), this means that the first player could steal the second player&#x27;s winning strategy simply by giving up the first move. Since the 1930s, however, the second player is typically awarded some compensation points, which makes the starting position asymmetrical, and the strategy-stealing argument will no longer work.

An elementary strategy in the game is &quot;mirror go&quot;, where the second player performs moves which are diagonally opposite those of this opponent. This approach may be defeated using ladder tactics, ko fights, or successfully competing for control of the board&#x27;s central point.

== Constructivity ==
The strategy-stealing argument shows that the second player cannot win, by means of deriving a contradiction from any hypothetical winning strategy for the second player. The argument is commonly employed in games where there can be no draw, by means of the law of the excluded middle. However, it does not provide an explicit strategy for the first player, and because of this it has been called non-constructive. This raises the question of how to actually compute a winning strategy.

For games with a finite number of reachable positions, such as chomp, a winning strategy can be found by exhaustive search. However, this might be impractical if the number of positions is large.

In 2019, Greg Bodwin and Ofer Grossman proved that the problem of finding a winning strategy is PSPACE-hard in two kinds of games in which strategy-stealing arguments were used: the minimum poset game and the symmetric Maker-Maker game.

<text>Hydrogen peroxide–urea (also called Hyperol, artizone, urea hydrogen peroxide, and UHP) is a white crystalline solid chemical compound composed of equimolar amounts of hydrogen peroxide and urea. It contains solid and water-free hydrogen peroxide, which offers a higher stability and better controllability than liquid hydrogen peroxide when used as an oxidizing agent. Often called carbamide peroxide in dentistry, it is used as a source of hydrogen peroxide when dissolved in water for bleaching, disinfection and oxidation.

== Production ==
For the preparation of the complex, urea is dissolved in 30% hydrogen peroxide (molar ratio 2:3) at temperatures below 60 °C. upon cooling this solution, hydrogen peroxide–urea precipitates out in the form of small platelets.

Akin to water of crystallization, hydrogen peroxide cocrystallizes with urea with the stoichiometry of 1:1. The compound is simply produced (on a scale of several hundred tonnes a year) by the dissolution of urea in excess concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution, followed by crystallization. The laboratory synthesis is analogous.

==Structure and properties==
The solid state structure of this adduct has been determined by neutron diffraction.

Hydrogen peroxide–urea is a readily water-soluble, odorless, crystalline solid, which is available as white powder or colorless needles or platelets. Upon dissolving in various solvents, the 1:1 complex dissociates back to urea and hydrogen peroxide. So just like hydrogen peroxide, the (erroneously) so-called adduct is an oxidizer but the release at room temperature in the presence of catalysts proceeds in a controlled manner. Thus the compound is suitable as a safer substitute for the unstable aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. Because of the tendency for thermal decomposition, which accelerates at temperatures above 82 °C, it should not be heated above 60 °C, particularly in pure form.

The solubility of commercial samples varies from 0.05 g/mL to more than 0.6 g/mL.

==Applications==

===Disinfectant and bleaching agent===
Hydrogen peroxide–urea is mainly used as a disinfecting and bleaching agent in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. As a drug, this compound is used in some preparations for the whitening of teeth. It is also used to relieve minor inflammation of gums, oral mucosal surfaces and lips including canker sores and dental irritation, and to emulsify and disperse earwax.

Carbamide peroxide is also suitable as a disinfectant, e.g. for germ reduction on contact lens surfaces or as an antiseptic for mouthwashes, ear drops or for superficial wounds and ulcers.

===Reagent in organic synthesis===
In the laboratory, it is used as a more easily handled replacement for hydrogen peroxide. It has proven to be a stable, easy-to-handle and effective oxidizing agent which is readily controllable by a suitable choice of the reaction conditions. It delivers oxidation products in an environmentally friendly manner and often in high yields especially in the presence of organic catalysts such as &quot;cis&quot;-butenedioic anhydride or inorganic catalysts such as sodium tungstate.

It converts thiols selectively to disulfides, secondary alcohols to ketones, sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones, nitriles to amides, and &quot;N&quot;-heterocycles to amine oxides.

Hydroxybenzaldehydes are converted to dihydroxybenzenes (Dakin reaction) and give, under suitable conditions, the corresponding benzoic acids.

It oxidizes ketones to esters, in particular cyclic ketones, such as substituted cyclohexanones or cyclobutanones to give lactones (Baeyer–Villiger oxidation).

The epoxidation of various alkenes in the presence of benzonitrile yields oxiranes in yields of 79 to 96%.

The oxygen atom transferred to the alkene originates from the peroxoimide acid formed intermediately from benzonitrile. The resulting imidic acid tautomerizes to the benzamide.

== Safety ==
The compound acts as a strong oxidizing agent and can cause skin irritation and severe eye damage. Urea–hydrogen peroxide was also found to be an insensitive high explosive, capable of detonation by strong impulse under heavy confinement.

<text>Luther College is a private Lutheran liberal arts college in Decorah, Iowa. Established as a Lutheran seminary in 1861 by Norwegian immigrants, the school today is an institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The upper campus was listed as the Luther College Campus Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.

==History==
On October 10, 1857, the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church (NELC) created a seminary to supply ministers for Norwegian congregations in the Upper Midwest. Until the seminary was established in 1861, students studied at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. On October 14, 1859, the Rev. Peter Laurentius Larsen was appointed professor to the Norwegian students at Concordia by the NELC.

Upon the closing of the seminary in April 1861, at the start of the Civil War, the NELC decided to open its own college that fall in a former parsonage at Halfway Creek, Wisconsin, just north of La Crosse, Wisconsin, and close to present-day Holmen, Wisconsin. On September 1, 1861, classes officially began with an enrollment of 16. The following year classes moved to Decorah, Iowa, with NELC Pastor Ulrik Vilhelm Koren successfully arranging the college&#x27;s relocation and permanent settlement.

In 1866, a group of students signed a &quot;bill of rights&quot; criticizing the rigid schedule, the rules about going downtown, the lack of windows in some of the sleeping rooms, and the woodcutting and shoe-shining chores, concluding that &quot;there was not enough freedom.&quot; The leader of the group, 18-year-old Rasmus Anderson, was expelled. This event was viewed as a rebellion and &quot;the worst of sins&quot; by the pastors assembled in a pastoral conference shortly after.

In 1905, Carlo A. Sperati, an 1888 graduate of Luther, became the music director of the college and developed the Luther College Concert Band, founded in 1878, on the model of the wind ensemble pioneered by John Philip Sousa. Under Sperati, the band undertook several tours of Europe, their first in 1914, earning international acclaim for their musical talent. Sperati remained on the faculty until his death in 1945.

In 1932, Luther College dropped its mandatory study of the classics and embraced the modern concept of the liberal arts education. Due to financial constraints associated with the Great Depression, the college decided to admit women as students in 1936. During the 1960s Luther constructed several new campus buildings and adopted a 4-1-4 semester schedule (two 4-month semesters with a 1-month session between them).

In 1964, Luther&#x27;s museum collection became separate from the college and was established as the Norwegian-American Museum. Now known as Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum, it is the largest and most comprehensive museum in the United States devoted to a single immigrant group. Nordic Fest, started in 1967, grew from Luther College Women&#x27;s Club&#x27;s annual celebration of Norwegian Constitution Day.

==Campus==
Luther lies at the edge of Decorah, a small town situated in the hilly driftless region of the Upper Midwest. The Upper Iowa River flows through the lower portion of the nearly central campus. The college owns an adjoining devoted to environmental research, biological studies, and recreation.

Luther student housing includes residence halls (Miller Hall, Dieseth Hall, Ylvisaker Hall, Farwell Hall, Brandt Hall, Larsen Hall, and Olson Hall) and several houses, townhouses, and apartment buildings. Ninety-five percent of Luther students live on campus all four years. Farwell, an upperclassmen dorm consisting of both double and single rooms housing 259 students, opened in 1991. Designed by Hammel, Green, &amp; Abramson Inc., the building has nine stories costing approximately $7,000,000.
In the 2000s, the college engaged in extensive building projects. A renovation of residence halls and the Dahl Centennial Union was completed in 2006, and Sampson Hoffland Laboratories, an extension of Valders Hall of Science, was completed in 2008.

The Center for Faith and Life is Luther&#x27;s largest and primary performing arts facility. Other performance areas on campus include the Center for the Arts and Jenson-Noble Hall of Music.

In 2021, the historic upper campus was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 33 resources, which included 17 contributing buildings, four contributing objects, seven non-contributing buildings, and five non-contributing objects. One of the contributing buildings, Koren Hall, was individually listed on the National Register in 1984.

==Academics==
Luther is an exclusively undergraduate institution, enrolling 1,744 students as of fall 2021 and employing 177 full-time faculty in 2015–2016. The college is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It is a member institution of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest and the Annapolis Group.

Among private liberal arts colleges, Luther was ranked 102nd by the 2021 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s college and university rankings.

Tuition and fees are shown as $61,500 for 2023–2024, with 98 percent of students receiving need- and/or merit-based financial aid.

Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Nursing (39)
::Management (31)
::Biology (29)
::Psychology (27)
::Music (19)
::Social Work (18)
::Political Science (17)

==Music==
Luther has a number of music organizations that tour and sell recordings internationally. The Nordic Choir, Concert Band, Symphony Orchestra and Jazz Orchestra are the college&#x27;s four internationally touring ensembles, which have performed in many of the major concert halls and music centers of Europe, as well as Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, and the Caribbean. About 40 percent of the students participate in at least one of the college&#x27;s five choirs, two concert bands, two string orchestras, and two jazz ensembles. &quot;Christmas at Luther,&quot; Luther&#x27;s annual Christmas concert, is broadcast nationwide each year. The concert broadcast is updated annually.

Much of Luther&#x27;s musical heritage can be attributed to the influence of two long-serving individuals. The 40-year tenure of Dr. Carlo A. Sperati, Class of 1888, fostered the college&#x27;s Lutheran musical tradition beginning in 1905 and developed the Luther College Concert Band into one of the first nationally touring music ensembles. Sperati&#x27;s Concert Band achieved national acclaim, and famed bandmaster John Philip Sousa canceled a performance of his own touring ensemble so that he could attend a performance of the Luther College Concert Band, which was scheduled to appear in a nearby city.

Sperati&#x27;s foundation was built upon by Weston Noble &#x27;43, himself a student of Sperati. Following three years of U.S. Army enlistment in World War II, Noble returned to his alma mater to conduct the Concert Band and the Nordic Choir, direct Christmastime performances of George Frederic Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, and teach in the Music Department. Noble&#x27;s bands (which he conducted until 1973) and choirs completed coast-to-coast tours and international appearances. Ensembles under his direction performed solo concerts at such venues as Lincoln Center and Town Hall in New York; the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC; the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City; Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles; Orchestra Hall at Symphony Center in Chicago; Orchestra Hall and the State Theatre in Minneapolis; and the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts in Saint Paul. Under Noble&#x27;s direction, Luther ensembles also appeared at historic cathedrals and concert halls throughout Europe, Russia, and Scandinavia, as well as on the programs of many national conventions of the American Bandmasters Association, the American Choral Directors Association, and the Music Educators National Conference.

The Nordic Choir was featured in the film &quot;The Joy of Bach&quot;, and in four weekly international broadcasts of &quot;The Hour of Power&quot; from the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. Weston Noble retired from the faculty at the close of the academic year in 2005, having served continuously for 57 years, from 1948 to 2005. A new film documentary &quot;To This Day&quot; about the first international tour of the Nordic Choir in 1967 was released in October 2017.
The Nordic Choir, which tours internationally, is one of the five choral ensembles at Luther. Collegiate Chorale is a SATB choir composed of upperclassmen and Cathedral Choir is a SATB choir composed of sophomores only. Aurora and Norskkor, featuring soprano-alto and tenor-bass voices, respectively, are composed entirely of first-year students. In addition to the five choirs, students have opportunities with Collegium Musicum and Vocal Jazz Ensemble. Collegium Musicum is an early music ensemble specializing in the music of the medieval, Renaissance, and baroque periods. The ensemble focuses more on instrumental works but incorporates vocal music throughout the academic year. The ensemble is open to singers of all years at Luther. The Vocal Jazz Ensemble is open to all students and often performs jointly with Luther&#x27;s instrumental jazz ensembles.

Symphony Orchestra, Jazz Orchestra, and Concert Band also tour internationally. Symphony Orchestra establishes residency in Vienna every four years, and Jazz Orchestra has toured in the Caribbean and Brazil. Concert Band travels internationally every five years and have visited countries such as Spain, Iceland, Norway, and more. Other instrumental ensembles include Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonia, Jazz Band, Symphonic Band, Brass Ensemble, among others.

Luther students also participate in faculty-coached student chamber ensembles ranging from piano trios to a full flute choir. Some of these ensembles include the Luther Ringers student handbell choir; the 40+ member Trombone Choir; five student-led, small-group a cappella ensembles; the Luther College Balalaika ensemble; and the student-led Luther Gospel Choir.

In 1996, musician Dave Matthews appeared in concert with Tim Reynolds at Luther College in the Center for Faith and Life, which resulted in their 1999 album &quot;Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds Live at Luther College&quot;.

In 2002, the Empire Brass, with college organist William Kuhlman, appeared in concert and recorded an album, &quot;Baroque Music for Brass and Organ&quot;, in the Center for Faith and Life. In 2008, musician Ben Folds appeared for his second time in concert at the Center for Faith and Life.

==Study abroad==
Each year, between 400 and 500 Luther students participate in international study, ranking Luther among the top baccalaureate colleges in the nation for the percentage of students who study abroad prior to graduation—over two-thirds. Over the years, more than 150 Luther faculty have led Luther students on programs in more than 70 countries.

==Athletics==
The Luther Norse have been a member of the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (now known as the American Rivers Conference (A-R-C) since its founding in 1922. Luther competes in 11 men&#x27;s and 10 women&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic programs. Since joining the Iowa Conference, Luther has won 237 IIAC/A-R-C titles.

Three hundred thirty-eight All-American honors have been earned by Luther student-athletes, and twenty-nine athletes have been crowned national champions. Sixty-eight student-athletes have been awarded the CoSIDA Academic All-American honor, and forty-two have received the distinguished NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship.

Since 1993–1994, the first year of the award, 1,929 academic all-conference honors have been earned by Luther student-athletes. To earn academic all-conference honors, a student-athlete must have a grade point average of 3.50 or greater on a 4.0 scale, have attended the school for a full year, and have competed in a varsity sport.

Approximately 25 percent of Luther students participate in one of the 21 varsity sports offered. A large majority of the study body participates in intramural activities which vary by semester and is offered by the Recreational Services program. Outdoor Recreational Services is an extension of the Recreational Services program in which students/staff lead outdoor activities such as slacklining, kayak trips on the Upper Iowa River, fall break trips, rock climbing, and whitewater rafting.

===Varsity sports===

===Club sports===

===Outdoor facilities===
Carlson Stadium: 5,000 seats; blue turf football field; eight-lane, 400-meter polyurethane track with two-directional approaches for pole vault and all jumping events; two shot put circles; discus/hammer cage; and multi-directional javelin-throwing areas.

Other outdoor facilities include 12 tennis courts, baseball and softball diamonds with enclosed dugouts, lighted soccer field, cross-country running course, intramural rugby, soccer, and ultimate frisbee pitches, fitness trail, ropes course, and room for cross country skiing.

===Indoor facilities===
The Regents Center Main Gymnasium: three full-sized basketball courts and seating capacity for 2,600. Used for practice and playing of volleyball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, and as the competition site venue for wrestling. Norse basketball teams also have access to full-sized cedar basketball court in the north gym and two basketball courts in the Sports and Recreation Center.

Sports and Recreation Center: newly renovated in 2022.

Legends Fitness Center: training center.

The Aquatic Center features a 25-yard, eight-lane pool with separate one-meter and three-meter diving well and a shallow area for swimming lessons, adaptive physical education classes, and water aerobics.

<text>Porfirio Rubirosa Ariza (January 22, 1909 – July 5, 1965) was a Dominican diplomat, race car driver, soldier and polo player. He was a supporter of dictator Rafael Trujillo, and was rumored to be a political assassin under his regime. Rubirosa made his mark as an international playboy for his jetsetting lifestyle and his legendary sexual prowess with women. His five spouses included two of the richest women in the world.

==Early life==
Porfirio Rubirosa Ariza was born in 1909 in San Francisco de Macorís, the third and youngest child of an upper-middle-class Criollo family. His parents were Pedro María Rubirosa and Ana Ariza Almánzar. The eldest child was named Ana and the elder son was named César. His paternal grandparents were Pedro Rovirosa, a Catalan immigrant, and María de la Paz Rossi, the daughter of an Italian immigrant. His maternal grandparents were Buenaventura Ariza y Castillo, who was from the provincial elite, and María Dolores Almánzar.

His father, also a womanizer, was at one time a &quot;general&quot; of a militia of heavily armed men working with the government in the mountainous Cibao region. Don Pedro advanced to become a diplomat, and after a stint at St. Thomas was made Chief of the Dominican Embassy to Paris in 1915. Rubirosa thus grew up in Paris, France, and returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of 17 to study law. But he soon changed course and enlisted in the military.

==Diplomat==
In 1931, Rubirosa met Rafael Trujillo at a country club. Trujillo asked to see him the next morning, and made him a lieutenant of his Presidential Guard. Their relationship lasted throughout their lives, went up and down, mostly close, but not without episodes of danger for Rubirosa, and defined his professional career when he became a diplomat of the Dominican Republic in 1936.

In this role, he was sent to embassies, first at Berlin (during the 1936 Olympic Games) and soon to Paris, where he spent most of his time; he also served at the embassies at Vichy, Buenos Aires, Rome, Havana (witnessing the Cuban Revolution), and Brussels. He was a frequent visitor to New York, Washington, Florida, and California. Rubirosa, who defined himself a &quot;Trujillista&quot;, moved freely among the rich and famous, made the connections, and kept the secrets. His 1938 divorce of Trujillo&#x27;s daughter seemed, at least on the surface, to have little influence over his erstwhile father-in-law&#x27;s affection for, or trust in, him. However, at times, when his escapades stirred up too much notoriety, Trujillo would dismiss him – as from his post in Paris in 1953 – or move him to another place. Trujillo recognized what an asset Rubirosa was for his regime, remarking: &quot;He is good at his job, because women like him and he is a wonderful liar.&quot;

After Trujillo&#x27;s assassination on May 30, 1961, Rubirosa supported his son, Rafael &quot;Ramfis&quot; Trujillo, as successor and attempted to persuade John F. Kennedy to help his government. Ramfis, however, lived a hedonistic playboy lifestyle much like Rubirosa himself. Not only were both men notorious womanizers, both men would later die in separate instances of a crash while car racing, something they both were very fond of. After his father&#x27;s assassination, Ramfis was unable to effectively stabilize the Dominican political situation and was ousted. When Ramfis and his family fled the Dominican Republic, Rubirosa&#x27;s career came to an end. On January 2, 1962, the Council of State removed him from his unique appointment as &quot;Inspector of Embassies&quot;. After he lost his diplomatic immunity, he was questioned by the New York District Attorney concerning the disappearance of Trujillo opponents Sergio Bencosme in 1935 and Jesus Galíndez in 1956, but was never charged. 

==Personal life==
Rubirosa was linked romantically to Dolores del Río, Eartha Kitt, Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner, Maria Montez, Rita Hayworth, Dorothy Dandridge, Lupe Vélez, Soraya Esfandiary, Peggy Hopkins Joyce, Joan Crawford, Veronica Lake, Kim Novak, Judy Garland, Eva Perón and Amália Rodrigues. He dallied with his ex-wife Flor de Oro Trujillo Ledesma during his marriage to Doris Duke. He and Zsa Zsa Gabor were seen together during her marriage to George Sanders. When she would not marry him, although George was divorcing her, Rubirosa married Barbara Hutton. He was named a co-respondent in George Sanders&#x27; divorce suit from Gabor.

Rubirosa was married five times, but he never had any children. His wives were:
* Flor de Oro Trujillo, Rafael Trujillo&#x27;s eldest daughter, December 2, 1932 – 1937
* Danielle Darrieux, French actress, September 18, 1942 – May 21, 1947
* Doris Duke, American heiress, September 1, 1947 – October 30, 1948; with marital gifts and final settlement he received an alimony ($25,000 per year until remarriage), a fishing fleet off Africa, several sports cars, a converted B-25 bomber (&quot;La Ganza&quot;), and a 17th-century house in Rue de Bellechasse, Paris.
* Barbara Hutton, American heiress, December 30, 1953 – February 20, 1954; in the settlement he received a coffee plantation in the Dominican Republic, another B-25, polo ponies, jewelry, and a reported $2.5 million.
* Odile Rodin, French actress, October 27, 1956 – July 5, 1965 (his death).

His playboy lifestyle was matched by stories of his sexual prowess. His reputedly larger than average penis size inspired Parisian waiters at Maxim&#x27;s to name gigantic pepper mills &quot;Rubirosas&quot;. The name stuck and has been in use all over the world. A high relief, life-size reproduction of Rubirosa&#x27;s swollen tool features among the artworks of the Saint Fracasso church in Velletri, near Rome, where it is worshipped by church-goers suffering from erectile dysfunctions. 

==Polo and car racing==
After World War II, Rubirosa became engaged in two major passions, polo and car racing, both expensive sports that would be supported in years to come by his wives. He organized and led his own polo team &quot;Cibao-La Pampa&quot; that was an often successful contender for the &quot;Coupe de France&quot;. Rubirosa played polo until the end of his life. In the same period, he started to acquire fast cars and form friendships with racing car drivers. He would own a number of Ferraris. His first race at 24 Hours of Le Mans took place in June 1950 with his partner Pierre Leygonie, and his second race, this time with Innocente Baggio, was four years later; in both races his car did not finish. Rubirosa participated in a number of races at Sebring, all but once as a private entry.

Rubirosa entered one Formula One race, in 1955, the Grand Prix de Bordeaux on April 25. He planned to drive his own Ferrari 500, identical to the one which brought Alberto Ascari the and Drivers&#x27; World Championship. However, he fell ill before the race and did not drive.

==Death==

Rubirosa died in the early morning of July 5, 1965, at the age of 56, when he crashed his silver Ferrari 250 GT cabriolet into a horse chestnut tree in the Bois de Boulogne after an all-night celebration at the Paris nightclub &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s&quot; in honor of winning the polo Coupe de France. He is buried in Cimetière de Marnes la Coquette, in Paris.

<doc id="709838" wikidata="Q7615300" url="?curid=709838" title="Steven Stefanowicz">
<text>Steven Anthony Stefanowicz was involved, as a private contractor for CACI International, in the interrogations at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.

== Life prior to Abu Ghraib ==

Steven Stefanowicz grew up in the suburban Philadelphia town of Telford, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Souderton Area High School in 1988. He was a center on the boys&#x27; basketball team, and a class leader. He graduated with a B.S. from the University of Maryland in 1995. He moved to Australia in 1999 following his Australian then-girlfriend Joanna Buttfield. A naval reservist, following the September 11 attacks, he sought full-time deployment with the Navy in 2002. He left the Navy in September 2003 and found employment with CACI.

== Activity related to Abu Ghraib ==

Stefanowicz was &quot;a contract interrogator for the 205th Intelligence Brigade.&quot; He was known in the prison by the nickname &quot;Big Steve&quot;. It has been alleged that he ordered and oversaw abusive interrogations which some have labelled as torture.

According to the New York Times, &quot;In mid-August, a team of civilian interrogators led by Steven Stephanowicz, a former Navy petty officer and an employee of a Virginia company called CACI International, began work at Abu Ghraib under a classified one-year military contract. ... Their job was to conduct interrogations in conjunction with military police and military intelligence units, according to a company memorandum.&quot;

In the report by Major General Antonio M. Taguba regarding the alleged acts of brutality, abuse, and torture at the Enemy Prisoner of War facility at Abu Ghraib and other Enemy Prisoner of War Camps in Iraq and Afghanistan, Taguba said, &quot;&#x27;Specifically I suspect that Col. Thomas M. Pappas, Lt. Col. Steve L. Jordan, Mr. Steven Stephanowicz and Mr. John Israel were either directly or indirectly responsible for the abuses at Abu Ghraib and strongly recommend immediate disciplinary actions ...&quot; 
In an interview with a military investigator, Col. Thomas Poppas described Stefanowicz as &quot;out of control&quot; in his commission of abuses. Poppas claims to have spoken to his superiors about this multiple times.

Taguba said that Stefanowicz &quot;should be given an official reprimand, have [his security clearance] reviewed, and, in the case of Stephanowicz, have his security clearance revoked and his employment as a civilian contractor terminated.&quot;

However, the online diary of another CACI interrogator at Abu Ghraib, Joe Ryan, reveals that a &quot;Steve Stefanowicz&quot; was still working at the prison on April 26, 2004, suggesting that Taguba&#x27;s conclusions were ignored until the prison abuse scandal broke in the media.

== Alleged abuses ==

According to testimony given by military policeman Pvt. Ivan Frederick II at the court-martial of Sgt. Michael J. Smith, Stefanowicz ordered the use of unmuzzled dogs to scare prisoners. The Fay Report finds this allegation &quot;highly plausible&quot;.

&quot;In an interview with Army investigators on April 6 and 7, 2005, Cpl. Charles Graner accused Stefanowicz of leading abuse...Under Stefanowicz&#x27;s direction, according to Graner, prisoners could be put on sleep plans: 20 hours awake, four hours of rest. They could be put in stress positions. They could be sexually humiliated.&quot;

Stefanowicz allegedly ordered women&#x27;s underwear put on a prisoner&#x27;s head, and tying that same prisoner&#x27;s hands above his head to a window until the prisoner passed out.

It is also alleged that Stefanowicz ordered a prisoner apparently suffering from appendicitis not be given his prescribed pain medication.

== Credibility of abuse allegations ==

Stefanowicz and his attorney denied these allegations, and claimed that Stefanowicz had even attempted to address a case of suspected abuse.

General Taguba considers Stefanowicz&#x27;s denials false, saying he &quot;made a false statement to the investigating team regarding the locations of his interrogations, the activities of his interrogations and his knowledge of abuses.&quot; Taguba&#x27;s report further states, &quot;He also allowed and possibility instructed MPs who had no knowledge of interrogation techniques to facilitate the activities by setting conditions which he &#x27;clearly knew his instructions equated to physical abuse&#x27;&quot;.

Army Chief Warrant Officer John D. Graham – an interrogation operations officer at Abu Ghraib – supports Stefanowicz and says Stefanowicz expressed concern of the treatment of prisoners and took the issue of mistreatment to superiors.

== Legal repercussions ==

Stefanowicz has not been criminally prosecuted based on the allegations. A court martial is not possible because Stefanowicz was a civilian. Standard criminal prosecution may not be possible due to legalities surrounding private military contractors in Iraq, including the fact that the CACI contract was with the Department of the Interior.

On July 30, 2004 the Al Rawi v. Titan Corporation class-action civil suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California naming Stefanowicz as a defendant.

On May 5, 2008, Stefanowicz was named as a defendant in the civil suit &quot;Emad Khudhayir Shahuth Al-Janabi v. Steven A. Stefanowicz, et al&quot; in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

<text>The Cucamonga Valley is a region of southwestern San Bernardino County and northwestern Riverside County, in southern California. It is located below the San Gabriel Mountains in the Inland Empire region.

==Geography==
It is a region of the eastern Pomona Valley and western San Bernardino Valley. It is located between Los Angeles and San Bernardino.

The Cucamonga Valley AVA, a designated American Viticultural Area, is in the valley region. It was a major site of wine production in the late 19th through mid−20th centuries, before regional urban expansion with land development and suburbanization spread into the area.

===Cities===
*Corona
*Eastvale
*Fontana
*Jurupa Valley
*Norco
*Ontario
*Rancho Cucamonga
*Rialto

==Demographics==
The demographics of the Cucamonga Valley have been shifting in recent years. The population of European Americans, who once constituted a large majority, is on the decline while the population of Latinos and African Americans is growing. Unlike most of Southern California, there is not a particularly strong representation of Asian Americans in the Cucamonga Valley, although it is steadily increasing. The city of Rancho Cucamonga has the highest population of Asian Americans in the Cucamonga Valley, at 9.0% of the population.

<text>The speckled wood (Pararge aegeria) is a butterfly found in and on the borders of woodland areas throughout much of the Palearctic realm. The species is subdivided into multiple subspecies, including &quot;Pararge aegeria aegeria&quot;, &quot;Pararge aegeria tircis&quot;, &quot;Pararge aegeria oblita&quot;, and &quot;Pararge aegeria insula&quot;. The color of this butterfly varies between subspecies. The existence of these subspecies is due to variation in morphology down a gradient corresponding to a geographic cline. The background of the wings ranges from brown to orange, and the spots are either pale yellow, white, cream, or a tawny orange. The speckled wood feeds on a variety of grass species. The males of this species exhibit two types of mate locating behaviors: territorial defense and patrolling. The proportion of males exhibiting these two strategies changes based on ecological conditions. The monandrous female must choose which type of male can help her reproduce successfully. Her decision is heavily influenced by environmental conditions.

==Taxonomy==
The speckled wood belongs to the genus &quot;Pararge&quot;, which comprises three species: &quot;Pararge aegeria&quot;, &quot;Pararge xiphia&quot;, and &quot;Pararge xiphioides&quot;. &quot;Pararge xiphia&quot; occurs on the Atlantic island of Madeira. &quot;Pararge xiphioides&quot; occurs on the Canary Islands. Molecular studies suggest that the African and Madeiran populations are closely related and distinct from European populations of both subspecies, suggesting that Madeira was colonized from Africa and that the African population has a long history of isolation from European populations. Furthermore, the species &quot;Pararge aegeria&quot; comprises four subspecies: &quot;Pararge aegeria aegeria&quot;, &quot;Pararge aegeria tircis&quot;, &quot;Pararge aegeria oblita&quot;, and &quot;Pararge aegeria insula&quot;. These subspecies stem from the fact that the speckled wood butterfly exhibits a cline across their range. This butterfly varies morphologically down the 700 km cline, resulting in the different subspecies corresponding to geographical areas.

==Description==
The average wingspan of both males and females is , although males tend to be slightly smaller than females. Furthermore, males possess a row of grayish-brown scent scales on their forewings that is absent in the females. Females have brighter and more distinct markings than males. The subspecies &quot;P. a. tircis&quot; is brown with pale yellow or cream spots and darker upperwing eyespots. The subspecies &quot;P. a. aegeria&quot; has a more orange background and the hindwing underside eyespots are reddish brown rather than black or dark gray. The two forms gradually intergrade into each other. Subspecies &quot;P. a. oblita&quot; is a darker brown, often approaching black with white rather than cream spots. The underside of its hindwings has a marginal pale purple band and a row of conspicuous white spots. The spots of subspecies &quot;P. a. insula&quot; are a tawny orange rather than a cream color. The underside of the forewings has patches of pale orange, and the underside of the hindwing has a purple-tinged band. Although there is considerable variation with each subspecies, identification of the different subspecies is manageable.

The morphology of this butterfly varies as a gradient down its geographic cline from north to south. The northern butterflies in this species have a bigger size, adult body mass, and wing area. These measurements decrease as one moves in a southerly direction in the speckled wood&#x27;s range. Forewing length on the other hand increases moving in a northerly direction. This is due to the fact that in the cooler temperatures of the northern part of this butterfly&#x27;s range, the butterflies need larger forewings for thermoregulation. Finally, the northern butterflies are darker than their southern counterpart, and there is a coloration gradient, down their geographical cline.

==Habitat and range==
The speckled wood occupies a diversity of grassy, flowery habitats in forest, meadow steppe, woods, and glades. It can also be found in urban areas alongside hedges, in wooded urban parks, and occasionally in gardens. Within its range the speckled wood typically prefers damp areas. It is generally found in woodland areas throughout much of the Palearctic realm. &quot;P. a. tircis&quot; is found in northern and central Europe, Asia Minor, Syria, Russia, and central Asia, and the &quot;P. a. aegeria&quot; is found in southwestern Europe and North Africa. Two additional subspecies are found within the British Isles: the Scottish speckled wood (&quot;P. a. oblita&quot;) is restricted to Scotland and its surrounding isles, and the Isles of Scilly speckled wood (&quot;P. a. insula&quot;) is found only on the Isles of Scilly. &quot;P. a. tircis&quot; and &quot;P. a. aegeria&quot; gradually intergrade into each other.
==Life history==


The eggs are laid on a variety of grass host plants. The caterpillar is green with a short, forked tail, and the chrysalis (pupa) is green or dark brown. The species is able to overwinter in two totally separated developmental stages, as pupae or as half-grown larvae. This leads to a complicated pattern of several adult flights per year.

===Food sources===
Larval food plants include a variety of grass species such as &quot;Agropyron&quot; (Lebanon), &quot;Brachypodium&quot; (Palaearctic), &quot;Brachypodium sylvaticum&quot; (British Isles), &quot;Bromus&quot; (Malta), &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot; (Spain), &quot;Dactylis glomerata&quot; (British Isles, Europe), &quot;Elymus repens&quot; (Lebanon), &quot;Elytrigia repens&quot; (Spain), &quot;Holcus lanatus&quot; (British Isles), &quot;Hordeum&quot; (Malta), &quot;Melica nutans&quot; (Finland), &quot;Melica uniflora&quot; (Europe), &quot;Oryzopsis miliacea&quot; (Spain), &quot;Poa annua&quot; (Lebanon), &quot;Poa nemoralis&quot; (Czechia/Slovakia), &quot;Poa trivialis&quot; (Czechia/Slovakia), but the preferred species of grass is the couch grass (&quot;Elytrigia repens&quot;). The adult is nectar feeding.

===Growth and development===
The growth and development of the speckled wood butterfly is dependent on the larval density and the sex of the individual. High larval densities result in decreased survivorship as well as a longer development and smaller adults. However, females are much more adversely affected by this phenomenon. They depend on their larval food stores during oviposition, so a high larval density in the larva stage can result in lower fecundity for females in the adult stage. Males can compensate for their smaller size by feeding as adults or switching mate-locating tactics, so they are less affected by high larval densities. A high growth rate can also negatively affect larval survivorship. Those with high growth rates will also have high weight-loss rates if food becomes scarce. They are less likely to survive if food becomes available once again.

==Mating behavior==
In the speckled wood butterfly females are monandrous; they typically only mate once within their lifetime. On the other hand, males are polygynous and typically mate multiple times. In order to locate females, males employ one of two strategies: territorial defense and patrolling.

During territorial defense, the male defends a sunny spot in the forest, waiting for females to stop by. Another strategy is patrolling, during which males fly through the forest actively searching for females. Then, the female must make a choice between mating with a patrolling male or a territorial male. By mating with a territorial male, a female can be sure that she has chosen a high quality male, as the ability to defend a territory reflects the genetic quality of a male. Therefore, by choosing a territorial male, the female is being more picky about which male she chooses to mate with.

The choice is most likely dependent on the search costs associated with finding a mate. When actively searching for a male, a female must spend her precious time and energy, which results in search costs, especially when she has a limited life span. As search costs increase, female choosiness for a mate decreases. For example, if a female&#x27;s life span is shorter, she has a higher cost associated with searching for the ideal mate. Therefore, she is likely to mate within a day of her emergence as an adult, and will most likely mate with a patrolling male, as they are easier to find. However, if a female lifespan is longer, then the search costs associated with finding a mate are lower. The female is then more likely to actively search for a territorial male. Since the search costs vary depending on environmental conditions, strategies vary from population to population.

Males employing different strategies, territorial defense or patrolling, can be differentiated by the number of spots on their hindwings. Those with three spots are more likely to be patrolling males, while those with four spots are more likely to be defending males. The frequency of the two phenotypes depends on the location and time of year. For example, there are more territorial males in areas where there are many sunny spots. Furthermore, the development of wingspots is influenced by environmental conditions. Therefore, the strategy employed by males is heavily dependent on environmental conditions.

==Territorial behavior==
Territorial defense involves a male flying or perching in a spot of sunlight that pierces through the forest canopy. The speckled wood butterfly spends the night high up in the trees, and territorial activity commences once sunlight passes through the canopy. The males often remain in the same sunspot until the evening, following the sunspot as it moves across the forest floor. The males often perch on vegetation near the forest floor. If a female flies into the territory, the resident male flies after her, the pair drop to the ground, and copulation follows. If another species flies through the sunspot, the resident male ignores the intruder.

However, if a conspecific, a male of the same species, enters the sunspot, the resident male flies towards the intruder almost bumping into him, and the pair fly upwards. The winner flies back towards the forest floor within the sunspot, while the defeated male flies away from the territory. The pattern of flight during this encounter depends on the vegetation. In an open understory, the pair fly straight upwards. In a dense understory, this flight pattern is not possible, so the pair spiral upwards.

In most of these interactions, the conflict is relatively short, and the resident male wins. The intruder most likely backs down as a serious confrontation could be costly, and there is an abundance of equally desirable sunspots. However, if both males believe they are the &quot;resident&quot; male, the conflict escalates. If a previous owner of the sunspot tries to reclaim his territory after he has left for mating, a longer and more costly fight ensues. In these serious fights, the winner of the contest is not predictable.

The abundance of territorial behavior depends on the environmental conditions. At the beginning of the mating season, fights over ownership of a sunspot territory are lengthy. The duration of the conflict quickly decreases during a period of two weeks. This pattern is correlated with the progression of the season, as temperature and male density rise. Sunspots are more attractive when temperatures are low, as they provide the warmth needed for higher levels of activity. As male density increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to hold onto a territory, so territoriality decreases and more males exhibit patrolling behavior.

===Asymmetry and territoriality===
In butterflies, asymmetrical wings are observed in three different ways: fluctuating (small, random variations from the standard bilateral symmetry), directional (variations that are biased towards a particular side so one wing is larger than the other), and antisymmetry (similar to directional but half of the individuals of the species find that a particular wing, such as their left, is larger, and the other half of the individuals find that their right is larger.

Both genders of the speckled wood butterfly exhibit asymmetrical wings; however, only males show directional asymmetry (likely to be caused by genetic factors). Also, females show more asymmetry in general compared to males. Within male speckled wood butterflies, the melanic form shows greater directional asymmetry and grows more slowly than the pale, territorial males. Furthermore, males that are most successful in territorial disputes are only slightly asymmetrical, as opposed to complete symmetry or asymmetry; this indicates that sexual selection affects asymmetry.

==Reproduction and offspring==
A female&#x27;s fecundity is dependent on body mass, as females deprived from sucrose during their oviposition period have reduced fecundity. Therefore, heavier females will produce a larger number of eggs. In addition to body mass, the number of eggs laid by a female may also be related to the time spent searching for an oviposition site. The number of eggs laid is inversely proportional to egg size. However, egg size was not found to have any influence on egg or larval survival, larval development time, or pupal weight under experimental conditions. One explanation may be that there is a tradeoff between the number of eggs laid and the time spent searching for the optimal oviposition site. A female would produce more eggs in an optimal environment, so she can produce more offspring and increase her reproductive fitness.

===Paternal investment===
During copulation in butterfly species, the male deposits a spermatophore in the female consisting of sperm and a secretion high in proteins and lipids. The female uses the nutrients in the spermatophore in egg production. In a polyandrous mating system, where sperm competition is present, it is beneficial for males to deposit a large spermatophore in order to fertilize the largest amount of eggs possible and possibly prevent the female from mating again.

Since most females in the speckled wood butterfly behave monandrously, there is decreased sperm competition, and the male&#x27;s spermatophore is much smaller relative to other species. The speckled wood male&#x27;s spermatophore size increases as body mass of the male increases. The spermatophore in the second copulation is significantly smaller, so copulation with a virgin male results in a higher number of larval offspring. Therefore, there is a cost to females associated with mating with a non-virgin male.

<text>Battle for the Planet of the Apes is a 1973 American science fiction film directed by J. Lee Thompson from a screenplay by John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington, based on a story by Paul Dehn. The film is the sequel to &quot;Conquest of the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1972) and the fifth and final installment in the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; film series. It stars Roddy McDowall, Claude Akins, Natalie Trundy, Severn Darden, Lew Ayres, Paul Williams, and John Huston. In the film, after conquering the oppressive humans, Caesar (McDowall) tries to keep the peace amongst the humans and apes, but uprisings endure.

&quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; was released in the United States on June 13, 1973, by 20th Century-Fox. The film received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics, grossing $8.8 million against a budget of nearly $2 million.

==Plot==
The orangutan Lawgiver, in &quot;North America – 2670 A.D.&quot;, explains to an unseen audience some key events of ape and human events in the late 20th century, then moves forward to the story of the chimpanzee Caesar in the early 21st century, years after a global nuclear war has destroyed human civilization.

Living with his wife, Lisa and their son, Cornelius, Caesar creates a new society while trying to cultivate peace between the apes and remaining humans. Caesar is opposed by an aggressive gorilla general named Aldo, who wants to imprison the humans who freely roam Ape City while doing menial labor.

After defusing followers of Aldo who attacked a human teacher Abe for saying &quot;No&quot; to apes, Caesar wonders if his own parents could have taught him how to make things better. MacDonald, Caesar&#x27;s human assistant reveals to Caesar that his older brother told him of archived footage of Cornelius and Zira within the underground, now radioactive ruins of what is known as the Forbidden City from the last film. Caesar travels with MacDonald and his orangutan advisor Virgil to the Forbidden City to find the archives.

It is revealed that mutated and radiation-scarred humans are living within the city, under the command of Governor Kolp, the man who once captured Caesar. Caesar and his party view the recordings of his parents, learning about the future and Earth&#x27;s eventual destruction before they are forced to flee when Kolp&#x27;s soldiers hunt them. Fearing the mutant humans may attack Ape City, Caesar reports his discoveries. When Caesar calls MacDonald and a select group of humans to the meeting, Aldo leads the gorillas away.

Kolp&#x27;s scouts find Ape City. Believing Caesar is planning to finish off all mutant humans, Kolp declares war on Ape City despite his assistant Méndez&#x27;s attempt to get him to see reason. Aldo plots a coup d&#x27;état in order for the gorillas to take control. Cornelius overhears from a nearby tree, but is critically wounded when Aldo spots him and hacks off the tree branch he is on with his sword. The next day, after a gorilla scouting pair are attacked by Kolp&#x27;s men, Aldo takes advantage of a grieving Caesar&#x27;s absence to have all humans corralled while looting the armory. Cornelius eventually dies from his wounds, leaving a devastated Caesar with the revelation that Cornelius was not hurt by humans.

When Kolp&#x27;s ragtag force launches their attack, Caesar orders the defenders to fall back. Finding Caesar lying among dozens of fallen apes, Kolp expresses his intention to personally kill him. The apes, however, are merely feigning death and launch a counterattack that captures most of the mutant humans. Kolp and his remaining forces try to escape, only to be slaughtered by Aldo&#x27;s troops once they are out in the open.

Aldo confronts Caesar about releasing the corralled local humans and orders the gorillas to kill them. When Caesar shields the humans and Aldo threatens him, Virgil, having learned the truth from MacDonald, reveals Aldo&#x27;s role in Cornelius&#x27;s death. Enraged with Aldo for breaking their most sacred law, &quot;ape shall never kill ape&quot;, all the apes begin to angrily approach Aldo. Caesar pursues him up a large tree, their confrontation resulting in Aldo falling to his death.

With Caesar now realizing that apes are no different than their former human slaveowners, he agrees to MacDonald&#x27;s request for humans to be treated as equals, co-existing in a new society. They store their guns in the armory; Caesar and Virgil reluctantly explain to the armory&#x27;s overseer, an orangutan named Mandemas, that they will still need their weapons for future conflicts and can only wait for the day when they will no longer need them.

The scene returns to the Lawgiver, saying it has now been over 600 years since Caesar&#x27;s death. His audience is revealed to be a group of young humans and apes, the Lawgiver noting that their society still waits for a day when their world will no longer need weapons, while they &quot;wait with hope&quot;. A closeup of a statue of Caesar shows a single tear falling from one eye.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
Initially, writer Paul Dehn, who had provided the script for every previous sequel, was hired to provide a story treatment for the fifth film in the series. Dehn withdrew from the project prior to completing the screenplay for health reasons. Screenwriters John William Corrington and Joyce Hooper Corrington were brought in after the success of their film &quot;The Omega Man&quot;, although prior to that, neither one of them had written any science fiction films. Joyce Carrington later admitted they had never seen any of the &quot;Apes&quot; films prior to being hired to write the script for &quot;Battle&quot;. Dehn was unavailable for the initial rewrites, but was hired to come in and do a final polish on the script. Dehn was given a story credit despite an appeal to the Writers Guild of America for shared credit on the screenplay. Dehn claimed to have rewritten 90% of the dialogue and he altered the ending. The original script by the Corringtons ended on a playground with ape and human children fighting. Dehn chose to go with a close up of a statue of Caesar with a tear falling from its eye which Joyce Corrington characterized as &quot;...stupid. It turned our stomachs when we saw it.&quot; The Writers Guild of America ruled in favor of the Corringtons for sole screenplay credit.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place on the Fox Movie Ranch for an estimated budget of $1.7 million. Heading into filming, director J. Lee Thompson was unhappy with both the script and the scope of the production, which he felt could have used a bigger budget to assist in the portrayal of &quot;Battle&quot;. Thompson had agreed to direct without a script in place and regretted that Paul Dehn could not have been on the project throughout the writing process.

&quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; was the second-to-last film produced by Arthur P. Jacobs. He died June 27, 1973, at age 51, exactly two weeks after its release.

==Extended cut==
The syndicated television version adds a few scenes cut from the theatrical release. One scene takes place after Aldo chases teacher Abe, where MacDonald reminds him why humans should not say &quot;no&quot; to an ape.

Another scene towards the end of the film shows the beginnings of the House of Mendez cult, as the humans in the city are about to fire off the doomsday bomb (as seen in &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;), but decide not to, as it would destroy the world. In &quot;Beneath&quot;, one can see many signs of Mendez in the Forbidden Zone, a hymnal on the pipe organ reading &quot;Mendez II&quot;, busts of past leaders of the mutant society (such as Mendez XIV), and the mutant leader in &quot;Beneath&quot; is also named Mendez. It is clear that Governor Mendez is a different leader than his predecessors, Breck and Kolp, since he is more sympathetic to the apes, as long as they do not invade their territory.

In 2006, the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; movies were re-released separately and in a new box set. This version was earlier released in a Japanese laserdisc boxset. Listed are the additional scenes:

* Near the end of the opening credits, the score continues to its original ending for 25 seconds, with extra footage of General Aldo approaching Ape City on his horse.
* The chase of the teacher of the apes is longer by 20 seconds.
* The mutant chief is walking around in his HQ, and has more dialogue.
* The entry into the ruins of the Forbidden City of the ape scout party with Caesar is 40 seconds longer, with more dialogue.
* The escape from the Forbidden City shows more footage and dialogue involving the apes.
* The scene where Cornelius is &quot;shot&quot; by a human boy begins slightly earlier, making it clear that the shooting is a game – which makes more sense, since no mutant party had yet even approached Ape City.
* DELETED SCENE: In this edited scene, Governor Kolp tells his lieutenant to fire an atomic missile on Ape City when he gives the signal.
* The mutant assault is 45 seconds longer. In this sequence, there were three more smaller cuts that reduced the battle scene by 40 additional seconds, and originally there was no musical score.
* The scene where Governor Kolp calls &quot;Sergeant York&quot; is missing.
* There are additional shots and dialogue before the mutants lay down the smoke screen.
* Roughly six minutes of the battle were cut.
* The scene where Aldo kills Governor Kolp and his followers in the school bus has been restored.
* The fight between Aldo and Caesar is longer.
* DELETED SCENE: Mendez has become the new governor and talks the mutant lieutenant out of firing the atomic missile. As they argue, they discover it is the Alpha-Omega bomb from &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; grossed a domestic total of $8.8 million, making it the lowest-grossing film in the series.

The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. The film holds a 36% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 28 critical reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Bereft of bright ideas and visually shabby, &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; takes a celebrated franchise and blows it all up -- the maniacs!&quot; On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 40 out of 100 based on 5 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four, stating, &quot;&quot;Battle&quot; looks like the last gasp of a dying series, a movie made simply to wring the dollars out of any remaining ape fans.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded one star out of four and wrote, &quot;The fifth and last in the successful Apes series is the worst of the lot, a bloody bore.&quot; A.D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; noted, &quot;This is the fifth and last feature film of the &#x27;Apes&#x27; series, and the fact shows too obviously in the Arthur P. Jacobs production, which is routine programmer material for fast playoff ... J. Lee Thompson&#x27;s perfunctory direction both reflects and sets the sluggish tone pervading the 86-minute film.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that director J. Lee Thompson &quot;will not win any awards for &#x27;Battle,&#x27; but the film&#x27;s simplicity defuses criticism. The chimpanzee and orangutan make-up remains remarkable, and the lines are occasionally bright and funny. There are far worse ways of wasting time.&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;ends it all with more of a thud than a bang—prolonging the concept but, again, failing to extend the idea.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in a positive review that although the film &quot;is launched from a more thinly contrived premise than any of its predecessors it becomes just as involving as they were, thanks to the strong appeal of the series&#x27; allegorical underpinnings and to the adroit direction of J. Lee Thompson, who stages several spectacular (rather than gory) battle scenes with the same finesse he displays in the film&#x27;s more intimate moments.&quot; David McGillivray wrote that &quot;almost every line of the Corringtons&#x27; thin script attests the strain of having to find anything new for the apes to say or do.&quot;
John Dooley has remarked that the taboo on &quot;No!&quot; sounds like the N-word taboo, building on the series allegory about racism.

==Legacy==
In the 2012 film &quot;Argo&quot;, based on the 1980 &quot;Canadian Caper&quot; rescue from Iran of U.S. diplomats hiding at the Canadian ambassador&#x27;s residence, Tony Mendez gets the idea for the fictitious &quot;Argo&quot; cover story from watching &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; on television. This was a nod to the role of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; make-up artist John Chambers in the Canadian Caper.

<text>The Skylab Rescue Mission (also SL-R) was an unflown rescue mission, planned as a contingency in the event of astronauts being stranded aboard the American Skylab space station. If flown, it would have used a modified Apollo Command Module that could be launched with a crew of two and return a crew of five.

Astronauts Vance Brand and Don Lind were assigned as the rescue crew, in the event of the mission&#x27;s necessity. A rescue mission was considered when the Skylab 3 Command/Service Module (CSM) developed problems in its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters while docked to the station. On the ground, space vehicles were assembled to fly rescue missions in support of both Skylab 3 and Skylab 4. However, no rescue mission ever proved necessary. All astronauts visiting Skylab returned safely to Earth in their original command modules.

==History==
Plans for outfitting an Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) as a space rescue vehicle date back to November 1965 when North American Rockwell technicians conceived the possibility of a rescue mission for astronauts trapped in lunar orbit. After a rescue mission in Earth orbit was depicted in the 1969 film &quot;Marooned&quot;, the company revived the concept in November 1970. Marshall Space Flight Center issued a formal Mission Requirements document on 17 May 1972, with subsequent revisions.

Skylab 3 astronauts Alan Bean and Jack Lousma helped design the &quot;field modification kit&quot; to use a standard CSM for rescue, and would have flown the CSM for their mission to rescue Skylab 2 if necessary. The standard Skylab Command Module accommodated a crew of three with storage lockers on the aft bulkhead for resupply of experiment film and other equipment, as well as the return of exposed film, data tapes and experiment samples. To convert the standard CSM to a rescue vehicle, the storage lockers were removed and replaced with two crew couches to seat a total of five crewmen. The biggest risk in a rescue was the three upper seats &quot;stroking&quot; or collapsing onto the two lower seats in a rough landing, but no stroking occurred in previous missions.

===AS 208===
Soon after Skylab 3&#x27;s launch the crew&#x27;s CSM developed a problem with Quad B, one of its four reaction control system thrusters. On August 2, 1973, six days later, a snowstorm-like effect outside the station startled the crew during breakfast. What appeared to be &quot;a real blizzard&quot; was fuel leaking from Quad D, opposite from Quad B. The malfunctions left two available quads, and while the spacecraft could operate with just one, the leaks posed a possible risk to other systems. The fuel for all quads and the main service propulsion system (SPS) engine were from the same batch; if the SPS fuel was contaminated, the CSM might not be able to deorbit.

NASA considered bringing the crew home immediately, but because the astronauts were safe on the station with ample supplies and because plans for a rescue flight existed, the mission continued while the Saturn IB rocket AS 208 with CSM 119 was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Launch Complex 39 for possible use. It was at one point rolled out to LC-39B.

NASA announced on August 4 that Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 backup crewmen Vance Brand and Don Lind would fly any rescue mission; they had immediately begun training for the flight once the second quad had failed on August 2. After engineers found that the leaks would not disable the spacecraft, the two men used simulators to test reentry using two quads. If ground personnel worked 24 hours a day and skipped some tests, the mission could launch on September 10, and would last no more than five days. The astronauts would attempt to prepare Skylab for further use but returning experimental data and diagnosing the cause of the problem were more important, with Lind choosing what would be brought back. Human urine and feces samples and Apollo Telescope Mount and other film were the priorities. Although Skylab had two docking ports the primary one would be used if possible, jettisoning the Skylab crew&#x27;s CSM if necessary.

While many within NASA believed that the rescue mission would occur, within hours of the failure of the second quad the agency canceled the rescue mission. Beyond NASA&#x27;s conclusion that the failed quads would not disable the Skylab 3 CSM and the SPS fuel was uncontaminated, Brand and Lind had already shown during their training as backup Skylab crewmen that a reentry with failed quads was safe. They also devised a method to deorbit with the command module&#x27;s attitude control system. Later joking that they were &quot;very efficient but perfectly stupid, because we have literally worked ourselves out of the mission&quot;, Brand and Lind continued to train for a rescue mission, as well as for their backup roles, but the Skylab 3 crew was able to complete its full 59-day mission on the station and safely return to Earth using the two functional RCS thruster quads, using the SPS engine once instead of twice as precaution.

===AS 209===

After the Skylab 4 launch, another rescue flight was assembled as a backup contingency. The Saturn IB rocket AS 209 was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Launch Complex 39 for possible use. It also used the CSM 119 Command Module that was to be launched with Brand and Lind.

There were also plans for a short 20-day Skylab 5 flight that would use this backup CSM. The crew, likely consisting of Brand, Lind, and Skylab backup Science Pilot William B. Lenoir, would have performed some scientific research and closed out the station until the Space Shuttle was operational. However, the extension of Skylab 4 from fifty-six to eighty-four days obviated the need for the additional mission.

==Crew==
Brand and Lind were assigned as the rescue mission&#x27;s crew, had it proven necessary. Although the rescue contingency was not flown, both astronauts made later spaceflights. Brand flew in 1975 as the Command Module Pilot of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project before commanding three Space Shuttle missions: STS-5 in 1982, STS-41-B in 1984, and STS-35 in 1990. Lind would wait another decade before he flew as a mission specialist on STS-51-B in 1985.

== Current location ==
Skylab Rescue hardware in now on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. CSM 119 is located in the Apollo/Saturn V Center. The Saturn IB booster for AS 209 is currently located in the Visitor Complex&#x27;s Rocket Garden. It is displayed horizontally, mated to an Apollo FVV (Facilities Verification Vehicle) which was formerly displayed at the VAB&#x27;s Visitor Complex circa October 1968.

In 2007, after the command module had sat untouched for over 30 years, NASA engineers used it for studies on the spacecraft&#x27;s life-support adapter assembly – the projecting aerodynamic fairing that allows oxygen, water, and electricity to flow from the Service Module to the Command Module. This was in support of the design and construction of a similar system on the new Orion spacecraft, which resembles the Skylab Rescue configuration.

It was planned that the crew which launched aboard Soyuz 32 would return to Earth using the Soyuz 33 spacecraft, while the crew launching with Soyuz 33 would visit briefly and return using the older Soyuz 32 spacecraft, the latter nearing the end of its design life. However, Soyuz 33 was unable to dock, endangering the cosmonauts aboard the station. As a contingency, the Soyuz 34 spacecraft was launched to the station without a crew aboard. The crew which had docked with Salyut 6 aboard Soyuz 32 returned safely to Earth via the Soyuz 34 spacecraft.

<text>USS &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; (CG-72) was a guided missile cruiser that served with the United States Navy. She was the second ship named for the Battle of Vella Gulf, a naval engagement in the Solomons campaign of World War II, the first being , an escort carrier commissioned in 1945. The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down on 22 April 1991 at Pascagoula, Mississippi, by Ingalls Shipbuilding, then a division of Litton Industries. She was launched on 13 June 1992, sponsored by Mary A. McCauley, wife of Vice Admiral William F. McCauley (Ret.), and commissioned on 18 September 1993 at Naval Station Norfolk.

Designed as a multi-mission ship, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; was capable of sustained combat operations in Anti-Air, Anti-Submarine, Anti-Surface, and Strike warfare environments. She supported carrier battle groups, amphibious assault groups, ballistic missile defense, as well as interdiction and escort missions. Her diverse combat capability was orchestrated by the Aegis Combat System, a fully integrated electronic detection, engagement, and fire-control system. Aegis enabled &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; to detect, evaluate, and engage an enemy with great firepower and accuracy.

==Ship history==
===1990s===
&quot;Vella Gulf&quot; successfully completed sea trials during the month of February 1998. In the months of May and June, she completed a two-month cruise, taking part in the 26th annual maritime exercise U.S. Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) &#x27;98 in the western Baltic Sea from 8 to 19 June 1998. During the exercise, the commander, Carrier Group Eight, commanded the exercise from the ship. She then completed an underway replenishment, her LAMPS helicopters moved aboard, she completed a successful command and control exercise (C2X), and had made a port call at Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands. Upon the completion of C2X, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; continued pre-deployment work-ups.

In January 1999, after winning her fifth consecutive &quot;Battle &quot;E&quot;,&quot; the ship commenced training operations while hosting the week-long course Force Air Defense Commander training. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot;″s successful completion, in February 1999, of Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) &#x27;99 marked the end of a ten-month work-up. The vessel headed out for deployment to the Adriatic Sea on 26 March 1999. After a six-day transit, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; took her position in the Adriatic Sea and participated in everything from Tomahawk Strike Ops to Fast-track Logistics Ops as part of Operation Noble Anvil. In May and June, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; continued to participate in support of combat operations, fired Tomahawks, assumed warfare commander duties (ADC, ASUWC, ASWC and Launch Area Coordinator), and conducted numerous at-sea refueling and stores replenishment events until the relaxation of weapons posture and cessation of hostilities. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; began the month of August engaged in multi-ship exercises, where she participated in DIVTACS, LeapFrogs, Tomahawk exercises, submarine exercises, Flight Ops, and Gunnery practice. On 22 September 1999 she returned home, then in November sailed to Yorktown, Virginia for a complete weapons offload.

===2000s===

As part of the Carrier Battle Group (CVBG), and in response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the ship set sail in support of defense and humanitarian efforts off the coast of New York. A week later, she deployed as part of the Carrier Battle Group, to the Mediterranean, and South Asia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; Carrier Battle Group transited the Suez Canal on 13 October and arrived in the Arabian Sea on 15 October, before returning home in April 2002.

In March 2003 she was assigned to Carrier Strike Group Eight.

On 5 January 2007, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; departed on a six-month cruise as part of the expeditionary strike group (BATESG). She conducted operations in the Persian Gulf, Northern Arabian Sea with the French aircraft carrier (in support of Operation Enduring Freedom), Gulf of Oman and Gulf of Aden. She participated in multi-national exercises, including AMAN &#x27;07, hosted by Pakistan. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; visited Agadir, Morocco and Gaeta, Italy as liberty ports of call, and twice visited Manama, Bahrain. She returned to her home port in Norfolk, Virginia on 3 July 2007.

====Anti-piracy operations====

&quot;Vella Gulf&quot; was identified as one of the U.S. Navy ships surrounding , a Ukrainian-owned, Belizean-registered ship carrying 33 T-72 tanks, RPGs and other munitions, after she was seized by pirates off Somalia on 25 September 2008. Ultimately the ship was not recaptured, and a ransom was paid.

On 11 February 2009 &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; responded to a distress call from the tanker &quot;Polaris&quot; in the Gulf of Aden. &quot;Polaris&quot; reported that pirates in a single skiff were attempting to board the tanker with ladders, though &quot;Polaris&quot;″s crew was able to thwart their efforts. Upon arriving in the area, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; intercepted a skiff with seven men aboard. The crew aboard &quot;Polaris&quot; identified them as the attackers, and they were taken aboard &quot;Vella Gulf&quot;, transferred to the supply ship for processing, and sent to Kenya for trial.

The following day, 12 February, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; responded to a distress call from the Indian freighter &quot;Premdivya&quot; which reported that she had been pursued by pirates who had fired at the ship. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; dispatched a helicopter to the scene which fired warning shots and chased the pirate skiff down. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; launched a boarding party in two RHIBs (inflatable boats) and captured nine pirates, who were again transferred to &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot; for processing.

===2010s===
In 2012 while &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; was at sea, a petty officer sexually assaulted a female sailor, telling her he planned to kill her and dispose of her body overboard. He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment.

In December 2015 the ship was assigned to Carrier Strike Group 12. On 23 April 2017, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; left for an eight-month deployment to support maritime security operations in the Persian Gulf.&quot; In July, she joined Carrier Strike Group 11 for three months, conducting air strikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and Syria. She returned on 15 December.

===2020s===

In 2020, a U.S. Navy budget plan proposed putting &quot;Vella Gulf,&quot; along with her &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class sister ships , , and , on a path to early decommissioning, as they had not been modernized.

In December 2020 the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels stated that the ship was planned to be placed Out of Commission in Reserve in 2022.

On 4 August 2022, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; was decommissioned at Naval Station Norfolk following just under 29 years of service. Disposal arrangements have not been announced. The ship will be berthed at Philadelphia.

<doc id="709887" wikidata="Q854730" url="?curid=709887" title="Bhairava">
<text>Bhairava (, ), or Kāla Bhairava, is a Shaivite and Vajrayāna deity worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists. In Shaivism, he is a powerful manifestation, or avatar, of Shiva. In the tradition of Kashmir Shaivism, Bhairava represents the Supreme Reality, synonymous to Para Brahman. Generally in Hinduism, Bhairava is also called Dandapāni (&quot;[he who holds the] danda in [his] hand&quot;), as he holds a rod or &quot;danda&quot; to punish sinners, and Svaśva, meaning, &quot;he whose vehicle is a dog&quot;. In Vajrayana Buddhism, he is considered a fierce emanation of boddhisatva Mañjuśrī, and also called Heruka, Vajrabhairava, Mahākāla and Yamantaka.

Bhairava is worshipped throughout India, Nepal, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Japan, as well as in Tibetan Buddhism.

== Etymology ==
Bhairava originates from the word &quot;bhīru&quot;, which means &quot;fearsome&quot;. Bhairava means &quot;terribly fearsome form&quot;. It is also known as one who destroys fear or one who is beyond fear.

==Hinduism==
=== Legend ===

The legend of the origin of Bhairava is traced back to a conversation between Brahma and Vishnu described in the Shiva Purana.

Shiva manifested as a pillar of light to settle the dispute of superiority between Brahma and Vishnu. Brahma dishonestly proclaimed his victory, stating that he had discovered the higher end of the pillar of light. To punish him for his dishonesty and arrogance, Shiva produced Bhairava from the region between his brows. When Bhairava sought instruction from Shiva, the deity directed him to &quot;worship Brahma with his sharp-pointed quick-moving sword&quot;. Bhairava decapitated the fifth head of Brahma for uttering the falsehood. Vishnu interceded on Brahma&#x27;s behalf and sought mercy, and the two deities then worshipped Shiva.

Having committed the sin of &quot;brahmahatya&quot; (the murder of a Brahmin) by decapitating Brahma, Bhairava was pursued by the terrible female personification of the sin. The skull of Brahma was still attached to his hand. To expiate himself of the sin, Bhairava roamed the three worlds. He visited Vaikuntha, where he was honoured by Vishnu and Lakshmi. When Bhairava visited Kashi, the city of the liberated, Brahmahatya left him, and the skull of Brahma was released from his hand.

In another legend, Brahma is regarded to have stated to Vishnu to worship him as the supreme creator of the universe. Noting that both Shiva and he had five heads, Brahma came to believe that he was identical to Shiva and was equal to his powers. When his arrogance started to affect his role in the universe, Shiva threw a lock of his hair from his head. This assumed the form of Bhairava, who decapitated one of Brahma&#x27;s heads. When the skull (kapala) of Brahma was held in the hand of Bhairava, the creator deity&#x27;s ego was destroyed and he became enlightened. In the form of Bhairava, Shiva is said to guard each of the Shakti Pithas (A group of temples dedicated to the goddess Shakti). Each Shakti Pitha is accompanied by a temple dedicated to Bhairava.

=== Depiction ===


In Kashmir Shaivism, Bhairava is the ultimate form of manifestation.

===Trika System===
Trika or Kashmiri Shaivism names the Absolute Reality (Para Brahman) as Bhairava. The Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra is a key Tantra text of the Trika System. Cast as a discourse between the god Bhairava and his consort Bhairavi it briefly presents 112 Tantric meditation methods or centering techniques (Dharana). The text is a chapter from the Rudrayamala Tantra, a Bhairava Agama. Bhairavi, the goddess, asks Bhairava to reveal the essence of the way to realization of the highest reality. In his answer Bhairava describes 112 ways to enter into the universal and transcendental state of consciousness. References to it appear throughout the literature of Trika, Kashmir Shaivism, indicating that it was considered to be an important text in the schools of Kashmir Shaiva philosophy and Trika.

== Buddhism ==
Buddhism also adopted Bhairava (Tibetan: &#x27;Jigs byed; Chinese: Buwei) as a deity and a dharmapala or dharma protector. The various buddhist forms of Bhairava (variously called Herukas, Vajrabhairava, Mahākāla and Yamantaka) are considered fierce deities and yidams (tantric meditational deity) in Tibetan Buddhism. They also have their own set of Buddhist tantras, the &quot;Vajrabhairava tantras.&quot; According to Tibetan tradition, these tantras were revealed to Lalitavajra in Oddiyana in the tenth century.

These texts play a particularly important role in the Sarma (new translation) traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, especially among the Gelug school where Vajrabhairava is one of the three central highest yoga tantra practices of the lineage.

Bhairava - Mahakala is also popular in Mongolia as a protector deity and was also popular among the Manchus.

The deity is also central to Newar Buddhism. The tantric practices associated with Bhairava focus on the transformation of anger and hatred into understanding.

==Worship==

Temples or shrines to Bhairava are present within or near most Jyotirlinga temples. There are also the sacred twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva which can be found all across India including the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi and the Kal Bhairava temple, Ujjain. The Patal Bhairava and Vikrant Bhairava shrines are located in Ujjain as well.

Gorat Kashmiris are known to worship Bhairava during Shivratri. The renowned Hindu reformer, Adi Sankara composed a hymn on &quot;Kala Bhairava&quot; called &quot;Sri Kalabhairava Ashtakam&quot; in the city of Kashi.

==Observances==
&quot;Bhairava Ashtami&quot;, commemorating the day &quot;Kala Bhairava&quot; appeared on earth, is celebrated on Krishna paksha Ashtami of the Margashirsha month of the Hindu calendar. It is a day filled with special prayers and rituals.

==Iconography==

Bhairava is depicted as being ornamented with a range of twisted serpents, which serve as earrings, bracelets, anklets, and sacred thread (&quot;yajnopavita&quot;). He wears a tiger skin and a ritual apron composed of human bones. Bhairava has a dog (&quot;shvana&quot;) as his divine &quot;vahana&quot; (vehicle). Bhairavi is a fierce and terrifying aspect of the Devi who is virtually indistinguishable from Kali, with the exception of her particular identification as the consort of Bhairava.

Bhairava himself has eight manifestations called the Ashta Bhairava:

* Asitāṅga Bhairava
* Ruru Bhairava
* Chaṇḍa Bhairava
* Krodha Bhairava
* Unmatta Bhairava
*Kapala Bhairava
* Bhīṣaṇa Bhairava
* Saṃhāra Bhairava

Kala Bhairava is conceptualized as the &quot;guru-natha&quot; (teacher and lord) of the planetary deity Shani (Saturn).

Bhairava is known as Bhairavar or Vairavar in Tamil, where he is often presented as a &quot;grama&quot; &quot;devata&quot; or village guardian who safeguards the devotee in eight directions (&quot;ettu tikku&quot;). Known in Sinhalese as Bahirawa, he is said to protect treasures. He is the main deity worshipped by the Aghora sect.

==Temples==

Thennaga Kasi Bairavar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Bairavar, a fierce form of Lord Shiva. It is located in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India. This temple is renowned for its unique architectural style and spiritual significance.

Bhairava is an important deity of the Newars of Nepal. All the traditional settlements of Newars have at least one temple of Bhairava. Most of the temples of Bhairava in Nepal are maintained by Tantric Newar priests. There are several Bhairava temples in the Kathmandu valley and other old newar settlements out of valley like Panauti,Banepa, Dhulikhel,Palpa and Pokhara.There are Different Jatras and chariot processions held each year in different newar towns and cities Dedicated to lord Bhairava and these Bhairava jatras are celebrated and continued from several hundreds of years in Nepal.Kalbhairava,Aakash bhairava, Shwet bhairava, Batuk bhairava, Pachali bhairava, aananda bhairava,Unmatta bhairava,mashaan bhairava,Baag bhairava, haygribha bhairava and Kritimukha Bhairava are Bhairavas widely worshipped and believed as the guardians of the Newar settlements.

In south Karnataka, Lord &quot;Sri Kalabhairaveshwara&quot; is present as &quot;Kshetra Palaka&quot; in Sri Adichunchanagiri Hills.

&quot;Kala Bhairava&quot; temples can also be found around &quot;Shaktipeeths&quot;. It is said that Shiva allocated the job of guarding each of the 52 &quot;Shaktipeeths&quot; to one Bhairava. There are said to be 52 forms of Bhairava, which are considered a manifestation of Shiva himself. Traditionally, &quot;Kala Bhairava&quot; is the &quot;Grama devata&quot; in the rural villages of Maharashtra, where he is referred to as &quot;Bhairava/Bhairavnath&quot; and &quot;Bairavar&quot;. In Karnataka, Lord Bhairava is the supreme God for the Hindu community commonly referred to as Vokkaligas (Gowdas). Especially in the Jogi Vokkaliga, he is considered the caretaker and punisher. Shri Kala Bhairava Nath Swami Temple of Madhya Pradesh is also popular.

<text>Dagmar Ingrid Braun Celeste (&quot;née&quot; Braun; born November 23, 1941) is an American counselor, and author. The former first lady of Ohio, she was married to former Ohio governor (1983–1991) and U.S. ambassador Richard F. Celeste, whom she met while attending Oxford University in England. They have six grown children, and were divorced in 1995.

==Early life and education==
Celeste was born in Krems, Lower Austria, Nazi occupied Austria. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in women&#x27;s studies, a public policy law degree from Capital University, and a master&#x27;s degree in alcoholism and drug abuse ministry from the Methodist Theological School in Ohio. She is also a licensed polarity practitioner.

==Politics and social issues==

Some notable achievements as first lady of Ohio included chairing the Ohio Recovery Council, spearheading the drive to establish the first state-sponsored on-site child care center and Employee Assistance Program in Ohio, initiating the Task Force on Family Violence, co-chairing the Governor&#x27;s Commission on Volunteerism, and serving as co-chair of the Council on Holocaust Education. She was an Ohio delegate to the Democratic Convention in 1980. Since 1992, she has continued to remain politically active through such organizations as the National Peace Institute, Women&#x27;s Action for Nuclear Disarmament, the Council for Ethics in Economics, and the Women&#x27;s Community Fund in Cleveland.

==Ordination==

In 2002, Celeste announced that she had secretly been ordained a priest of the Roman Catholic Church under the pseudonym of &quot;Angela White&quot;. She was one of seven women, the &quot;Danube Seven&quot;, ordained by Argentinian independent Catholic bishop Rómulo Antonio Braschi on a boat on the Danube River, making her the first female American Roman Catholic to call herself a priest. Celeste was subsequently excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church, which does not recognize the validity of the ordination of women.

==Other activities==

Celeste serves as the executive director of the Tyrian network, &quot;an intentional learning community founded in 2000 on Kelleys Island, Ohio and dedicated to Brigid, both the Goddess and the Saint&quot;. She is the author of the auto-biographical book &quot;We Can Do Together: Impressions of a Recovering Feminist First Lady&quot;. She has also participated in productions of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. She is a long-standing professional Life Balance coach who developed an individualized three-month coaching process designed to empower one to discover a life worth living by embracing the life one is truly called to.

<text>Swadlincote is a historic mining town in the district of South Derbyshire, in the county of Derbyshire, England. It lies within The National Forest area. It borders the counties of Leicestershire and Staffordshire, southeast of Burton upon Trent and north-west of Ashby-de-la-Zouch and southwest of Derby. It covers the suburban areas of Church Gresley, Goseley, Midway, Newhall, Oversetts and Woodville and had a population of 34,576 at the 2021 census.

==History==
Swadlincote&#x27;s name is derived from the Old English &#x27;, &#x27; being a man&#x27;s name and &quot;&quot; meaning cottages. Past forms of the name include Sivardingescote and Swartlincote. Local residents sometimes shorten its name to &quot;Swad&quot;.

The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded Swadlincote as a small manor. It was part of the parish of Gresley (latterly Church Gresley) until the 19th century.

The first record of mineral extraction in the area is from the end of the 13th century, but the area remained rural until the industrialisation in the 18th century. The presence of coal and clay in the area led to urbanisation, as collieries (such as the Granville Colliery), brickworks and potteries came to dominate. These industries continued to expand until the Second World War. One traditional bottle-shaped kiln survives in Alexandra Road.

The fire-clay strata in the coal measures has a high alumina content. Swadlincote is one of only six places in Britain with clay deposits of such quality. This makes it particularly suitable for salt glazing. The properties of the clay mean it is easily shaped into pipes that are resistant to sewage. The Public Health Act 1875 created a huge demand for locally produced pipes.

Emmanuel Church of England parish church is a Gothic Revival building consecrated in 1846, designed by Henry Isaac Stevens and completed in 1848. Swadlincote also had a Wesleyan chapel by then. Today the town has also the Roman Catholic church of Saints Peter and Paul designed by the architect George Bernard Cox and completed in 1958. 

Swadlincote Town Hall was completed in 1861. The first local-government body for the town was Swadlincote District local board of health, formed in 1871. Its area consisted of three civil parishes: Church Gresley, Stanton and Newhall and Swadlincote. Under the Local Government Act 1894, this became Swadlincote and District Urban District, renamed Swadlincote Urban District in 1951. In 1974 the urban district was merged with Repton Rural District and part of South East Derbyshire Rural District to form the present South Derbyshire District.
The urban district council was granted a coat of arms in 1947, in a design that reflected how Swadlincote was formed of part of the ancient parish of Church Gresley. Round the edge of the shield was a &quot;bordure&quot; or border in a &quot;vairy&quot; pattern of red and ermine, from the arms of the Gresley family, who took their name from the parish. The dedication of Gresley parish church to Saint George and Saint Mary was represented by their symbols: a cross and a fleur de lys respectively. The quartered ermine and red field of the shield was taken from the arms of the Stanhope family, Earls of Harrington. The Tudor roses were taken from the arms of Derbyshire County Council. Above the arms was a crest depicting a human arm holding a &quot;billet or&quot;: a yellow brick for the local brick-making industry. The arm rose from flames, indicative of mining of fireclay and coal. The Latin motto adopted: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Riches from the earth&quot;) also referred to the mineral industries of Swadlincote. The current arms of South Derbyshire District Council, which bear the motto &quot;The Earth Our Wealth&quot;, and also reflect this heritage.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the town&#x27;s Rink venue (now demolished and the site of industrial units) hosted major British and American pop stars. Gene Vincent appeared on 7 September 1963, and Ringo Starr in 1962, while he was drummer for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.

==Governance==
Swadlincote covers four of the 15 wards of South Derbyshire District, returning 12 of the 36 district councillors: Church Gresley (three councillors), Newhall and Stanton (three), Midway (three) and Swadlincote (three). As of the 2023 election, all twelve are Labour Party councillors.

Swadlincote forms part of the South Derbyshire parliamentary constituency. Between 1997 and 2010 its MP was Mark Todd (Labour). In the 2010 general election, the seat was won by the Conservative Party candidate Heather Wheeler, an ex-leader of the Conservative group on South Derbyshire District Council. Labour&#x27;s Samantha Niblett won the seat from Wheeler in the 2024 general election and serves as the current MP. A notable previous MP is Edwina Currie (Conservative). Until 1983 the area was part of the Belper constituency.

==Geography==
The town is located within the Leicestershire and South Derbyshire Coalfield. Its landscape is marked by shallow valleys and ridges, shaped particularly by the mining activity which once dominated the area. Swadlincote lies within the National Forest, and there has been significant tree planting around Gresley Common, Swadlincote Woodlands and Church Gresley.

The suburbs of Newhall and Stanton to the north-west lie along the Burton upon Trent and Swadlincote Green Belt, as a curb to development which could have caused Swadlincote to merge with the Winshill and Stapenhill districts of Burton-on-Trent. Most of the green belt lies in Derbyshire, with small tracts in Staffordshire. Hence most of Swadlincote&#x27;s 21st-century expansion has been to the south and east of the centre, particularly adjacent to Woodville and Church Gresley.

Swadlincote is encircled by several villages and hamlets including Hartshorne, Albert Village, Blackfordby, Overseal, Moira, Linton, Boundary, Norris Hill and Spring Cottage.

==Demography==
Swadlincote had a population of 34,576 in the 2021 Census. 

The town&#x27;s ethnicity composition was recorded at: 

*White - 33,534 (97%)
*Mixed Race - 457 (1.3%)
*Asian - 348 (1%)
*Black - 135 (0.4%)
*Other - 94 (0.3%)

==Economy==
The town originally had a prominent manufacturing heritage that made pipes and earthenware. It was the centre of the South Derbyshire coalfield, but mining ceased when Rawdon Colliery closed in 1993. Light manufacturing and service companies are sited on large industrial estates.

Swadlincote has a moderate-sized town centre typical of the Midlands, containing national chain stores and small local businesses. It had a branch of Somerfield before the Co-operative Group took over the chain in 2009. The opening of a large chain supermarket on Coppice Side has been blamed as a factor behind the closure of several small independent shops. The shops that lined West Street and High Street from 1901 had disappeared by the early 21st century. Hepworth Retail Park is a modern development with a restaurant, cinema and various shops.

Plans were announced in 2008 for a new retail complex consisting of a cinema, DIY store and a nationally recognised clothing store. A link road called Sir Herbert Wragg Way has been built, named after the area&#x27;s mid-20th century Member of Parliament and pipe-yard owner.

A pub bar and restaurant opened on the former Empire Cinema site in April 2007, named &quot;The Paramount&quot; after Paramount Cars, a manufacturer based in the town in the 1950s. The pub closed in June 2013. Masseys DIY store, which was founded in Swadlincote in 1947, won the 2023 East Staffordshire and South Derbyshire Business Awards.

==Transport==
Swadlincote is near the junction of the A514 (Derby to A444) and A511 (Burton-upon-Trent to Ashby-de-la-Zouch) roads.

In 1804 the Ashby Canal opened, with its northern terminus at Moira, Leicestershire. Also built were tramways to carry coal and ceramics from Swadlincote and elsewhere to the canal for shipment.

The Midland Railway opened its Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line in 1845, with Gresley railway station to serve the area. It later built a branch with two stations, at Swadlincote itself and neighbouring Woodville. Passenger services on the branch ended in 1947. British Railways closed Gresley in 1964, making the nearest station, away. The Leicester to Burton Line, via Gresley, remains open for goods traffic and in the 1990s there were plans to restart the passenger service as the second phase of Leicestershire&#x27;s Ivanhoe Line. This plan was shelved after the privatisation of British Rail, and Swadlincote remains one of the UK&#x27;s largest towns without a railway station.

Swadlincote is served by the Arriva Midlands and Diamond East Midlands bus companies.

Swadlincote is on National Cycle Network Route 63. Though currently under development, it is signed from Civic Way through to Church Gresley via Maurice Lea Park with links onward to the heart of the National Forest.

==Media==
Television signals can only be received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter which broadcast BBC West Midlands and ITV Central (West). However, BBC East Midlands and ITV Central (East) are also received through cable and satellite television such as Freesat and Sky. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby on 104.5 FM, Capital Mid-Counties (formerly Touch FM) on 101.6 FM, Smooth East Midlands on 101.4 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 106.0 FM.

==Education==
Schools in Swadlincote include Granville Academy at Woodville, Mercia Academy (formerly the William Allitt School) at Newhall, St George&#x27;s School and Pennine Way Junior Academy in Church Gresley, Belmont and Springfield Junior Schools and The Pingle Academy on Coronation Street, which with 1,200 pupils is Swadlincote&#x27;s largest secondary school.

The closest university is the University of Derby, 18 miles (29 km) to the north, with Staffordshire University&#x27;s Lichfield campus an equal distance to the south-west.

==Amenities==

The main attractions in Swadlincote are local parks, such as Maurice Lea Memorial Park at Church Gresley, Eureka Park and Cadley Park which have all been awarded Green Flag status. Other amenities include Green Bank Leisure Centre, a large dry ski slope, golf course, library and a &#x27;50s American Diner, said to be the largest such establishment in the UK. All are within easy reach of the town centre.

Swadlincote Woodlands Forest Park is an 80-acre site, with more than 40,000 trees, two recreational forest trails and has a number of view points across the town. It is also the proposed site for the Pipeworks arts and media project, a charity-based community theatre and media production facility.

The town&#x27;s one museum is the Sharpe&#x27;s Pottery Museum, devoted to the town&#x27;s ceramic heritage. It contains a café, gift shop of locally produced wares, and The Magic Attic local history archive. The town&#x27;s Tourist Information Centre is located at 1 High Street.

Local youth organisations include No. 1211 (Swadlincote) Squadron of the Air Training Corps based in Eureka Park.

==Sport==
Gresley Rovers is a semi-professional association football team based at Moat Street, Church Gresley.

A greyhound racing track existed from 1948 to 1962, it was called the Darklands Sports Stadium and was located off Darklands Lane. The racing was independent (known as a &quot;flapping&quot; track) because it was unaffiliated to the sport&#x27;s governing body, the National Greyhound Racing Club. The venue was also used for Harness, Pony Racing and Stock Car Racing. 

==Accent and dialect==
The area around Swadlincote has historically had a distinct dialect. It shares terms and pronunciations common in Burton-upon-Trent (West Midlands) and Derby (East Midlands).

Recently, people have been moving to the town from Staffordshire (Tamworth, Rugeley, Lichfield, etc.), who use Swadlincote as a dormitory site, working elsewhere. This West Midlands accent can be heard alongside the traditional one.

<doc id="709923" wikidata="Q833454" url="?curid=709923" title="Brent Cross">
<text>Brent Cross is a major traffic interchange and area in the London Borough of Barnet, England. Originally the name of a crossroads, it is located a mile from the centres of Hendon and Golders Green. Notably, the Brent Cross Shopping Centre, a major retail facility, was opened in 1976, south of the interchange. The &quot;Brent Cross Flyover&quot; A41 runs to the east of the shopping centre over the A406 North Circular Road, while the M1 motorway and A5 Edgware Road are to the west at Staples Corner interchange. In addition, the Northern line (Edgware branch) and Thameslink rail routes run on viaducts.

The River Brent passes through the area, flowing from east to west in a man-made channel. The Shopping Centre falls within the NW4 postcode district; the Brent South Retail Park falls within NW2; and the Brent Cross tube station is within NW11.

== History ==

&quot;Brent Cross&quot; was originally the name of a crossroads in the vicinity of the current Brent Cross Flyover. By 1944, the term was being used to describe addresses north of the A406 North Circular Road and west of the A41 Hendon Way and after the eponymous shopping centre was built it was also used to describe business addresses south of the North Circular.

Previously the area had been known as Renters Farm, a name dating from 1309, and it remained largely farmland until the nineteenth century. In the late nineteenth century a sewage works was built there and Hendon Greyhound Stadium stood there from 1935 to 1972. In 1976 the Brent Cross Shopping Centre was opened, the first stand-alone shopping centre to be built in the United Kingdom.

In the 1920s and 1930s, two major roads through the area were constructed, the east–west A406 North Circular Road and the north–south A41 Hendon Way. In 1923 the Northern line (Edgware branch) was extended on a short viaduct over the River Brent.

In 1964–1965 the Brent Cross Flyover was built to carry the Hendon Way over the North Circular. During its construction, a fatal accident occurred on 20 June 1964 while erecting a large crane at the site. The crane jib buckled and collapsed onto a coach travelling east on the North Circular Road killing seven passengers on board. A question was raised in Parliament about the accident on 22 June.

Brent South Shopping Park, a retail park, was built in 2004. The park has 10 retail stores including Next, DFS and Sports Direct.

Whilst three-level roundabouts are compact and initially cheap to build, they have been criticised for their short lifespans, turning difficulties and limited capacity. Soon after construction, some engineers had concerns regarding the interchange. In October 2022, Transport for London (TfL) imposed a 7.5 tonne weight restriction on the flyover due to issues with the bridge&#x27;s structural integrity. According to TfL, a £50 million investment from the Department for Transport would be required to complete a repair of the flyover, though some criticised the plans in light of other issues with TfL&#x27;s maintenance of infrastructure. TfL issued contracts for renewal works in early 2024, with at least £2.5 million allocated to the project, not including £2.4 million spent on a feasibility study.

=== Brent Cross Cricklewood development ===
Brent Cross Cricklewood is a planned new town centre development in Hendon and Cricklewood. The development is planned to cost around £4.5 billion to construct and will include 7,500 homes, of offices, four parks, transport improvements and a extension of Brent Cross Shopping Centre. The developers of the scheme are Hammerson and Abrdn. 200 new retail stores are included in the original plan. To counter the disruption of the area by the building works, the developers have offered to &#x27;green up&#x27; the bridge over the North Circular and maintain it as a &#x27;living bridge&#x27; making a horticultural contribution to the basic scheme. As market for new retail stores changes and demand is expected to decline with the shift to online shopping, BXS is changing its delivery plan and intends to focus on residential development first. Construction was planned to start in 2018 and be completed in 2021-22 but the retail development has currently been put on hold.

The London Underground stations nearest to the shopping centre are Brent Cross and Hendon Central, both on the Northern line. According to the council, both &quot;feel very remote and lack adequate pedestrian links and signage&quot;, and the 10 to 15-minute walks are through &quot;a hostile pedestrian environment.&quot;. Transport schemes have been proposed involving Brent Cross, as part of, or concurrent to, the Brent Cross Cricklewood development. These include measures promoted by the Brent Cross Cricklewood developers but the subjects of objections to their planning application, including
*a new railway station on the Thameslink line
*new bridges over the A406 North Circular, but the removal of another bridge
*moving the bus station closer to the A406 North Circular
*significant changes to the road network within and around the development.

<text>Craniodiaphyseal dysplasia (CDD), also known as lionitis, is an extremely rare autosomal recessive bone disorder that causes calcium to build up in the skull, disfiguring the facial features and reducing life expectancy.

These calcium deposits decrease the size of cranial foramina, and can decrease the circumference of the cervical spinal canal. In the few cases recorded, most died in childhood.

==Symptoms and signs==

==Cause==
The underlying genetics are uncertain.

==Diagnosis==
Among the medical signs are dacryocystitis, seizures, intellectual disability, and paralysis, each of which is a complication resulting from the diminutive foramina. A common sign reported as a result of the disease has been widely spaced eyes.

==Society and culture==
Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s 1985 drama film &quot;Mask&quot; drew public attention to the case of Roy Lee &quot;Rocky&quot; Dennis, an American boy with this disorder who died at the age of 16, in 1978.

In the American medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; episode &quot;Yesterday&quot;, Jesse Plemons plays a teenage boy with lionitis.

The main character of the two-issue comic book miniseries &quot;Friday the 13th: How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot; by Wildstorm Productions is a 13-year-old boy with the disorder. 

In the anthology television series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; season 1, Beauregard, the brother of Tate and Adelaide, has lionitis.

<text>Severny Island () is a Russian Arctic island. It is the northern island of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago.
It was historically called Lütke Land after Friedrich Benjamin von Lütke, who explored it. It lies approximately 400 km north of the Russian mainland. It has an area of , making it the 30th-largest island in the world and the 3rd-largest uninhabited island in the world, although there was formerly a settlement at Lagerni on the northern shore of the narrow Matochkin Strait. It is part of Russian Arctic National Park.

==Geography==
Severny Island is separated from Yuzhny Island (&quot;Southern&quot;) by the narrow Matochkin Strait. Forty percent of the island is covered by the Severny Island ice cap, which is the largest glacier by area and by volume in Europe (if counted as part of it). Severny Island is known for its numerous glaciers. Cape Flissingsky is the easternmost point of Severny Island, while Cape Zhelaniya is the northernmost point; the most westterly point is Sukhoy Nos.

==Climate==
Severny Island has a cold tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;), with average temperatures barely reaching the freezing mark in the warmest months. The temperature varies from in winter to in summer.

===Ice cap and glaciers===
Unlike Yuzhny Island, Severny has an inner ice cap with numerous glaciers, most of which have their terminus on the eastern or western shore of the island.

==History==
The cape of Sukhoy Nos, located at the southern end of the island, was used for nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961. The Tsar Bomba hydrogen bomb test on October 30, 1961 destroyed all buildings in the village of Severny (both wooden and brick). The village was located 55 kilometres (34 miles) from ground zero within the Sukhoy Nos test range. Tsar Bomba was the most powerful nuclear weapon detonated and was the most powerful anthropogenic explosion in human history. It had a yield of 50 megatons of TNT, scaled down from its maximum 100 megaton design yield. Severny is now the site of a Russian Army base and has a harbor.

There is a meteorological station at Cape Zhelaniya, Severny&#x27;s northernmost cape.

<doc id="709954" wikidata="Q1345782" url="?curid=709954" title="John Balance">
<text>Geoffrey Nigel Laurence Rushton (16 February 1962 – 13 November 2004), better known under the pseudonyms John Balance or the later variation Jhonn Balance, was an English musician, occultist, artist and poet.

He was best known as a co-founder of the experimental music group Coil, in collaboration with his partner Peter &quot;Sleazy&quot; Christopherson. Coil was active from 1982 to Balance&#x27;s death in 2004. He was responsible for the majority of Coil&#x27;s vocals, lyrics and chants, along with synthesizers and various other instruments both commonplace and esoteric.

Outside Coil he collaborated with Cultural Amnesia (at the beginning of the 1980s), Nurse with Wound, Death in June, Psychic TV, Current 93, Chris &amp; Cosey, Thighpaulsandra, and produced several Nine Inch Nails remixes.

==Early life and career==
Balance was born Geoffrey Laurence Burton. He took the surname &#x27;Rushton&#x27; from his stepfather. During his teens, Balance became acquainted with Christopherson as a fan of the latter&#x27;s group Throbbing Gristle. The duo were both members of Psychic TV, Christopherson&#x27;s next project after Throbbing Gristle. They eventually quit Psychic TV to form Coil.

Balance was extremely active as a youth and in his early twenties. Apart from his early musical releases and involvement in bands before Coil, he published seven issues of a fanzine, &quot;Stabmental&quot;, and was a tireless correspondent with members of the alternative musical and cultural scene in the UK and also abroad. He also released three compilation albums of music by bands and artists about which he was enthusiastic: &quot;Endzeit&quot;, &quot;Bethel&quot; and &quot;The Men with the Deadly Dreams&quot;. The compilations are today collector&#x27;s items and fetch high prices. Also from his youth, Balance was an avid occultist, maintaining a lifelong interest in the likes of Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare.

==Death==
On 13 November 2004, during a period of heavy drinking, Balance fell from a two-storey balcony at his home and died that evening in the hospital. Peter Christopherson announced Balance&#x27;s death on the Threshold House website, and provided details surrounding the accident. Balance&#x27;s memorial service was held near Bristol on 23 November, and was attended by approximately 100 people. November 2014 saw the publication of a retrospective volume of his art called &quot;Bright Lights and Cats with no Mouths&quot; by Edition Timeless.

==Discography==
Balance first recorded using the alias &quot;Murderwerkers&quot;. The Murderwerkers track, &quot;Blue Funk (Scars for E)&quot;, was included on the Sterile Records cassette compilation &quot;Standard Response&quot;. Balance also published an underground zine, &quot;Stabmental&quot;, and released a track, &quot;A Thin Veil of Blood&quot;, also using the nom de guerre Stabmental. &quot;A Thin Veil of Blood&quot; was included on the cassette compilation &quot;Deleted Funtime – Various Tunes for Various Loons&quot;. Balance then joined up with Peter Christopherson and Boyd Rice to record &quot;Nightmare Culture&quot; under the moniker &quot;The Sickness of Snakes&quot;. Balance subsequently joined Psychic TV and performed alongside Christopherson; however in 1984, Balance and Christopherson left the group to develop Coil. A short collaboration with Zos Kia produced the split tape &quot;Transparent&quot;. Credit for the album was shared, and marked Coil&#x27;s first release. The original Coil / Zos Kia tape, &quot;Transparent&quot;, was released as a &quot;His-Storical&quot; CD reissue in 1997.

During Coil&#x27;s 23-year career, Balance collaborated with a number of his peers, including Jim Thirlwell/Clint Ruin (Foetus), Marc Almond, Thighpaulsandra, NON, Current 93, and CoH; appearing on many of these artists&#x27; albums.

<doc id="709958" wikidata="Q2420453" url="?curid=709958" title="Matrioshka brain">
<text>A matrioshka brain is a hypothetical megastructure of immense computational capacity powered by a Dyson sphere. It was proposed in 1997 by Robert J. Bradbury (1956–2011). It is an example of a class-B stellar engine, employing the entire energy output of a star to drive computer systems. 
This concept derives its name from the nesting Russian matryoshka dolls.
The concept was deployed by Bradbury in the anthology &quot;Year Million: Science at the Far Edge of Knowledge&quot;.

==Concept==

The concept of a matrioshka brain comes from the idea of using Dyson spheres to power an enormous, star-sized computer. The term &quot;matrioshka brain&quot; originates from matryoshka dolls, which are wooden Russian nesting dolls. Matrioshka brains are composed of several Dyson spheres nested inside one another, the same way that matryoshka dolls are composed of multiple nested doll components. 

The innermost Dyson sphere of the matrioshka brain would draw energy directly from the star it surrounds and give off large amounts of waste heat while computing at a high temperature. The next surrounding Dyson sphere would absorb this waste heat and use it for its computational purposes, all while giving off waste heat of its own. This heat would be absorbed by the next sphere, and so on, with each sphere radiating at a lower temperature than the one before it. For this reason, Matrioshka brains with more nested Dyson spheres would tend to be more efficient, as they would waste less heat energy. The inner shells could run at nearly the same temperature as the star itself, while the outer ones would be close to the temperature of interstellar space. The engineering requirements and resources needed for this would be enormous.
=== Jupiter Brain ===
The term &quot;matrioshka brain&quot; was invented by Robert Bradbury as an alternative to the Jupiter brain—a concept similar to the matrioshka brain, but on a smaller planetary scale and optimized for minimal signal propagation delay. A matrioshka brain design is concentrated on sheer capacity and the maximum amount of energy extracted from its source star, while a Jupiter brain is optimized for computational speed. Jupiter brain is related to the idea of the hypothetical material computronium, which could be enmassed to sizes of entire planets and even stars.

==Possible uses==

Some possible uses of such an immense computational resource have been proposed.
* An idea suggested by Charles Stross, in his novel &quot;Accelerando&quot;, would be to use it to run perfect simulations or uploads of human minds into virtual reality spaces supported by the matrioshka brain. Stross even went as far as to suggest that a sufficiently powerful species utilizing enough raw processing power could launch attacks upon, and manipulate, the structure of the universe itself.
* In &quot;Godplayers&quot; (2005), Damien Broderick surmises that a matrioshka brain would allow simulating entire alternate universes.
* The futurist and transhumanist author Anders Sandberg wrote an essay speculating on implications of computing on the massive scale of machines such as the matrioshka brain, published by the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies.
* Matrioshka brains and other megastructures are a common theme in the fictional Orion&#x27;s Arm universe, where they are used by superintelligences as processing nodes connected by artificial wormholes.

* The Dennis E. Taylor novel Heaven&#x27;s River mentions building a Matrioshka brain for use with replicant and artificial intelligence.

* In the Evan Currie novel, &quot;A Seed That Was Sown&quot;, the beginning of a new series subsequent to his &quot;Odyssey One&quot; series, makes use of a Matrioshka Brain as a central threat. Currie routinely uses tech at the edge of human knowledge for story components.
* In &quot;the Expanse&quot; novel series, a crystalline sphere the size of Jupiter was found in a white dwarf system, dubbed the Adro Diamond. It was built by the ancient Ring Builder civilization as a massive computer and data storage archive. Estimated to be five billion years old, the Adro Diamond orbits a white dwarf star called Adro (with its name derived from the star it orbits), and possesses a machine-perfect smooth surface and is composed of densely packed carbon, making it almost transparent. Seemingly abandoned, the species that built the structure has long been extinct.

<text>Yuzhny Island () is the southern island of Russia&#x27;s Novaya Zemlya archipelago, lying north of mainland Russia. It has an area of , which while smaller than the northern island of Severny, still makes it one of the largest islands in the world. It is separated from Severny Island by the narrow Matochkin Strait, which is covered with ice most of the year. West of Yuzhny Island lies the Barents Sea, to the north the Arctic Ocean, to the east the Kara Sea, and to the south the Pechora Sea.

==History==
Originally home to the Nenets people, the island was largely evacuated in the 1950s to make way for nuclear weapons testing.

==Ecology==
Yuzhny Island is known for its large seabird population. The island&#x27;s vegetation largely consists of tundra.

<doc id="709989" wikidata="Q3444092" url="?curid=709989" title="Valve trombone">
<text>The valve trombone is a brass instrument in the trombone family that has a set of valves to vary the pitch instead of (or in addition to) a slide. Although it has been built in sizes from alto to contrabass, it is the tenor valve trombone pitched in B♭ an octave lower than the trumpet which has seen the most widespread use. The most common models have three piston valves. They are found in jazz and popular music, as well as marching bands in Europe, where they are often built with rotary valves and were widely used in orchestras in the 19th century.

== History ==

The valve trombone emerged concurrently with the invention of valves in the early 19th century. Most early instruments retained the shape and form of the slide trombone, employing three valves with the tubing arranged in place of the slide; others used the new valve mechanism as an opportunity to explore different configurations while retaining the overall cylindrical bore and bell profile.

It enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 19th century, when the technology of valves was developing rapidly. They became popular in European orchestras particularly in Italy and Austria, where composers wrote with a section of three valve trombones in mind. Among the first French valve trombones was the , configured upright with three Stölzel valves, briefly replacing the quinticlave in bands until it was itself replaced by saxhorns.

Valve trombones were made in many configurations for marching bands, and in particular for mounted bands. A type of invented by Adolphe Sax in the 1860s has six valves, instead of the usual three, one for each position on the trombone slide. Instead of adding tubing, these valves isolate different amounts of tubing from the total length. Their unusual shape was designed to make it easier for players in cavalry bands to hold and use while mounted. They were included in the curriculum at the Conservatoire de Paris in the last half of the 19th century, and used in French orchestras for a time despite the large amounts of tubing which made the instruments heavy and unwieldy to play. In Austria-Hungary in the 1860s, instrument makers V. F. Červený &amp; Synové invented a family of () in sizes from E♭ alto to B♭ contrabass, also designed for use in mounted and marching bands.

The valve trombone was popular in American brass bands and military bands in the mid to late 19th century. In New Orleans the slide trombone did not appear until the &quot;tailgate&quot; style of playing emerged around 1904.

Valved alto trombones in E♭ were occasionally built but remain rare instruments; a few survive in museums.

A contrabass valve trombone known as the was developed in the late 19th century and is used mainly in operas by Verdi and Puccini. This instrument was the prototype for the modern &quot;cimbasso&quot;, which has seen a 21st century revival in video game music and film scores.

By the beginning of the 20th century, mass production of reliable instruments with high quality slides led to a return to popularity of the slide trombone. Despite this, valve trombones still remain popular in parts of eastern Europe and Italy, in Banda music, military and brass bands in South America and India, and in jazz, often as a doubling instrument for trumpet players.

== Performance characteristics ==

Some passages, particularly fast musical figures, are easier to execute on a valve trombone than on a slide trombone. Italian composers in particular, such as Verdi and Rossini, made use of its agility. The valve trombone is also useful for situations when the movement of a slide can be impractical, such as when marching, mounted, or playing in a cramped orchestra pit.
Many players consider the tone of a valve trombone to be stuffier and less open, and it is no longer common in orchestras. 

== In jazz ==
As the B tenor valve trombone uses the same fingering as the B trumpet, it is occasionally a doubling instrument for jazz trumpeters. Notable jazz musicians who play the B tenor valve trombone include Maynard Ferguson, Bob Brookmeyer, Clifford Thornton, Juan Tizol of the Duke Ellington Orchestra, Rob McConnell and Bob Enevoldsen.

In the 1920s a valve trombone reconfigured into a saxophone shape was developed in Germany, called the &quot;normaphone&quot; (). It was later taken up by American jazz musicians, including William &quot;Hicky&quot; Kelly in the 1960s and Scott Robinson in the 70s.

== Hybrid slide-valve trombones ==
Trombones that combine both a slide with a set of valves were built in the late 19th century by Besson and C.G. Conn. In the 1940s, jazz musician and machinist Brad Gowans invented a &quot;valide&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;valve&quot; and &quot;slide&quot;) with three piston valves and a short four-position slide. 
In the 1970s, jazz trumpeter Maynard Ferguson and Larry Ramirez of Holton Musical Instruments developed and patented the Holton TR-395 &quot;Superbone&quot; for Ferguson to use in his band. Similar to the 19th century instruments, it has a very narrow bore of , three piston valves, and adds a slide lock which frees the player to operate the valves or the slide with either hand. Holton manufactured it between 1974 and 2004. Subsequent models developed in the early 21st century by British instrument maker Wessex and Australian jazz musician James Morrison use a larger bore. Morrison&#x27;s model, built by Austrian instrument manufacturer Schagerl, has three rotary valves built into the bell section.

<text>In mathematics, a Clifford module is a representation of a Clifford algebra. In general a Clifford algebra &quot;C&quot; is a central simple algebra over some field extension &quot;L&quot; of the field &quot;K&quot; over which the quadratic form &quot;Q&quot; defining &quot;C&quot; is defined.

The abstract theory of Clifford modules was founded by a paper of M. F. Atiyah, R. Bott and Arnold S. Shapiro. A fundamental result on Clifford modules is that the Morita equivalence class of a Clifford algebra (the equivalence class of the category of Clifford modules over it) depends only on the signature . This is an algebraic form of Bott periodicity.

==Matrix representations of real Clifford algebras==
We will need to study &quot;anticommuting&quot; matrices () because in Clifford algebras orthogonal vectors anticommute
:formula_1

For the real Clifford algebra formula_2, we need mutually anticommuting matrices, of which &quot;p&quot; have +1 as square and &quot;q&quot; have −1 as square.
:formula_3

Such a basis of gamma matrices is not unique. One can always obtain another set of gamma matrices satisfying the same Clifford algebra by means of a similarity transformation.

:formula_4

where &quot;S&quot; is a non-singular matrix. The sets &quot;γ&quot;&quot;a&quot;′ and &quot;γ&quot;&quot;a&quot; belong to the same equivalence class.

==Real Clifford algebra R3,1==

Developed by Ettore Majorana, this Clifford module enables the construction of a Dirac-like equation without complex numbers, and its elements are called Majorana spinors.

The four basis vectors are the three Pauli matrices and a fourth antihermitian matrix. The signature is (+++−). For the signatures (+−−−) and (−−−+) often used in physics, 4×4 complex matrices or 8×8 real matrices are needed.

<doc id="710004" wikidata="Q2842971" url="?curid=710004" title="American Liberty League">
<text>The American Liberty League was an American political organization formed in 1934. Its membership consisted primarily of wealthy business elites and prominent political figures, who were for the most part conservatives opposed to the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The group emphasized private property and individual liberties. Its leader Jouett Shouse called on members to:
:defend and uphold the constitution of the United States ... to teach the necessity of respect for the rights of persons and property as fundamental to every successful form of government ... teach the duty of government to encourage and protect individual and group initiative and enterprise, to foster the right to work, earn, save, and acquire property, and to preserve the ownership and lawful use of property when acquired.

It was highly active in spreading its message for two years. Following the landslide re-election of Roosevelt in 1936, it sharply reduced its activities and disbanded entirely in 1940.

==History==

===Formation and leadership===
The creation of the league was announced in Washington, D.C., on August 22, 1934, by a group of Democrats and a smaller number of Republicans. Jouett Shouse, who had been prominent in Democratic politics and the anti-Prohibition movement, became the group&#x27;s first chairman. The makeup of the league&#x27;s executive committee was designed to demonstrate its bipartisan nature. It included: John W. Davis and Al Smith, former Democratic candidates for president; wealthy businessman Irénée du Pont, who left the Republicans to support Al Smith in 1928 and Roosevelt in 1932; and two New York Republicans, Nathan L. Miller, the state&#x27;s former governor, and Representative James W. Wadsworth. The moving spirit behind the launch of the organization was John Jacob Raskob, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and the foremost opponent of Prohibition, former director of General Motors and a board member of DuPont.

Reaction to the league formation was generally skeptical of its non-partisan nature. President Roosevelt told a press conference that the league seemed founded &quot;to uphold two of the Ten Commandments,&quot; stopping at protecting property and drawing no inspiration from the command to &quot;Love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; Arthur Krock wrote a few weeks later, just after the November election, that the league was prepared to announce more eminent members of its leadership group &quot;to eradicate the purely political and anti-administration tinge that colored the league in the beginning.&quot;

The league proceeded to name a National Executive Committee of 25 and a National Advisory Council of about 200. Those named constituted a geographically diverse group, almost all drawn from the upper echelons of American industry. Among the notable exceptions were Hollywood movie producer Hal Roach and naval hero Richmond Pearson Hobson. More typical were Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. of General Motors and J. Howard Pew of Sun Oil Company.

Membership exceeded 36,000 in July 1935, only 27% of whom were contributors. It doubled by January 1936, peaked at 125,000 in the middle of 1936, and then declined rapidly following the 1936 election.

The league targeted college students for membership and had particular success at state universities. There were 345 chapters with more than 10,000 members by April 1936. Academics played a variety of roles. For example, New York University economist Walter Spahr gave speeches that the league reproduced in pamphlet form, though an attempt to organize a committee of academic economists failed.

=== Alleged conspiracy ===
Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler, alleged in November 1934 that a bond salesman named Gerald C. MacGuire told him that leaders in the League wanted Butler to lead 500,000 veterans in a coup to overthrow President Franklin Roosevelt. Butler and MacGuire were not active in the league and it rejected the allegations as nonsense. Butler admitted he never was approached by any league official and admitted he got the story from Maguire, a local bond salesman who had no role in the league. Maguire told Congress there was no such plot, and historians are divided on the allegations. Butler would repeat his claims about the plot at paid speeches to left wing groups.

===1936 campaign===
Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign manager accused the Liberty League of being an &quot;ally of the Republican National Committee&quot; which would &quot;squeeze the worker dry in his old age and cast him like an orange rind into the refuse pail.&quot;

The Republican campaign, not content with the league&#x27;s declaration of non-partisanship, asked it to &quot;stay aloof from too close alliance with the Landon campaign.&quot; FDR&#x27;s campaign manager used that information as the basis for saying that the league had behaved so badly that it &quot;had to be repudiated by the regular Republican organization,&quot; further drawing the league into protestations of nonpartisanship that highlighted its partisan role.

===Dissolution===
Following the 1936 elections in which FDR won by a landslide and his party expanded its majorities in both houses of Congress, the league eliminated its public activities and restricted itself to reviewing legislation and sending its assessments to members of Congress. A small national staff remained, but all state and local offices closed. Only the three du Pont brothers, Irénée, Lammot and Pierre, financed the organization, until the du Ponts decided to devote as much of their financial resources as possible to Republican Willkie&#x27;s 1940 campaign. The league closed its Washington office in September 1940.

==Education programs==
The league produced 135 pamphlet titles during its first two years, printed for easy distribution by mail. Half of them originated as speeches or radio addresses delivered by league officers or its most prominent supporters. A total of more than five copies went to newspapers and government agencies, public and college libraries, all members of Congress, and other political groups, often generating new stories and reports in other publications. It also produced two-page monthly bulletins in a more popular style, but distributed to the same audience as the pamphlets. A different promotional tactic that downplayed the role of the league itself was the creation of a syndicated news service. Before its discontinuation near the end of 1936, the league reached 1600 newspapers through the Western Newspaper Union. Finally, the league took advantage of offers of free radio time.

==Positions==
Regarding the controversial National Recovery Administration (NRA), the league was ambivalent. Jouett Shouse, the league president commented that &quot;the NRA has indulged in unwarranted excesses of attempted regulation&quot;; on the other, he added that &quot;in many regards [the NRA] has served a useful purpose.&quot; Shouse said that he had &quot;deep sympathy&quot; with the goals of the NRA, explaining, &quot;While I feel very strongly that the prohibition of child labor, the maintenance of a minimum wage and the limitation of the hours of work belong under our form of government in the realm of the affairs of the different states, yet I am entirely willing to agree that in the case of an overwhelming national emergency the Federal Government for a limited period should be permitted to assume jurisdiction of them.&quot;

The League labeled Roosevelt&#x27;s Agricultural Adjustment Administration &quot;a trend toward Fascist control of agriculture&quot; and supported the Farmers Independence Council of America to oppose the administration. Social Security was said to &quot;mark the end of democracy.&quot;

Lawyers for the American Liberty League challenged the validity of the Wagner Act (National Labor Relations Act), but in 1937, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The American Federation of Labor accused the League of hiring detectives to infiltrate labor unions and incite strikes and violence.

==Funding==
On the national level, the league&#x27;s total expenditures over its six-year life amounted to $1,200,000, with more than a million of that being spent during its most active months before the 1936 election. Wealthy donors dominated, so that &quot;fewer than two dozen bankers, industrialists, and businessmen&quot; accounted for more than half the league&#x27;s 1935 monies on the national level, with the du Pont family responsible for 30% of the total. The next year, 30 donors provided two-thirds of the funds and the du Ponts&#x27; share of the total exceeded 25%. Few continued to contribute after the 1936 elections.

During the 1936 campaign, Postmaster General James Farley, FDR&#x27;s campaign manager, mocked it as the &quot;du Pont Liberty League.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1940, Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington reporter and later columnist Thomas L. Stokes looked back on the American Liberty League and called it &quot;a very vulnerable straw man&quot; for New Deal Democrats. FDR wanted to run in 1936, he wrote, without emphasizing his Democratic identity. The league&#x27;s alliance of conservative Democrats &quot;in whom the rank and file long ago had lost confidence&quot; like Al Smith with &quot;conservative Republicans, among whom were lawyers for great corporations&quot; helped President Roosevelt&#x27;s backers to present him as a man independent of traditional politicians and political alliances.

In 1950, Roosevelt&#x27;s successor Harry Truman branded critics who labelled his programs &quot;socialism&quot; as the heirs of the Liberty League of the 1930s.
J. Carlyle Sitterson, Professor of American History at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, characterized the American Liberty League as &quot;The Cellophane League&quot; - because it was a duPont product, and &quot;you could see right through it!&quot;

<doc id="710011" wikidata="Q775072" url="?curid=710011" title="List of hospitals in the Netherlands">
<text>This is a list of [[hospital]]s in the [[Netherlands]].

Most general hospitals provide broad care. Early 2024 there were 143 hospital locations for general care.

The eight university hospitals offer the highest level of care available in the Netherlands. Each of these hospitals offers specialized services such as neurosurgery, cardiac surgery, a high-level emergency department, advanced oncology, departments for infectious diseases, and other services such a nuclear medicine generally not found in other hospitals.

There are also a number of specialised centers that provide the most specialised care to the entire country or a larger region. These include specialised children hospitals. With the exception of the Juliana Children Hospital in The Hague, all Dutch Children Hospitals are part of a University hospital. Other specialised centers are the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, the national burn center associated with the Red Cross Hospital in Beverwijk, the Central Military Hospital, in Utrecht, and the national Major Incident Hospital (at University Medical Center Utrecht) consisting of a sleeping hospital with a capacity of 100 beds consisting of a mix of intensive, mid and low level care, surgery rooms etc. The Major Incident Hospital can be activated within 30 minutes.

==Teaching hospitals==
All hospitals listed here are also listed under their respective provinces.

The 8 university hospitals are involved in the teaching of medical doctors and other medical staff. Their teaching includes teaching at all levels from vocational nursing training through undergraduate medical school (bachelor level) to MSc and PhD levels in medicine.

A larger number of high quality hospitals participate in training of medical doctors, nurses and lab technicians in the lasts years of their study.

===University hospitals===
The Dutch university hospitals are:
* Amsterdam University Medical Centers &quot; Amsterdam UMC &quot; (AUMC), Amsterdam, has 2 location and emerged from merger of the VU University Medical Center (VUmc) and Academic Medical Center (Amsterdam) (AMC). Includes the Emma Children Hospital
* University Medical Center Groningen &quot;Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen&quot; (UMCG), Groningen, Includes the Beatrix Children Hospital
* University Medical Center Utrecht &quot;Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht&quot; (UMCU), Utrecht. Includes the Wilhelmina Children&#x27;s Hospital, the Prinses Maxima Center (children oncololgy), the national Major Incident Hospital (on standby until needed), and closely collaborates with the (located next door).
* Leiden University Medical Center &quot;Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum&quot; (LUMC), Leiden
* Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre &quot;Radboudumc&quot; (previously, Universitair Medisch Centrum St. Radboud), Nijmegen, includes Amalia Children&#x27;s hospital
* Maastricht UMC+ &quot;Maastricht Universitair Medisch Centrum &quot; (MUMC+), Maastricht

===Non-university teaching hospitals===
A number of hospitals that deliver a broad spectrum of specialised care at high level contribute to training of healthcare professionals by offering internships as part of the later years of university medical doctor training and contribute to education programmes of other medical staff (e.g. nursing, laboratory technicians). Several of these hospitals have organised themselves into an association of top hospitals. Hospitals can apply for membership if they provide (at least) 12 different specialisations at top level and contribute to teaching (members of top hospital association are indicated with * in the following list).

<text>Keōua Hale was the mansion of Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani at 1302 Queen Emma Street in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii.

== History ==
The mansion was built upon the site of Ruth and her adoptive son Leleiohoku&#x27;s residence in Honolulu, &quot;Kaakopua&quot;. It burned down in 1873 and plans were made to build a grander home on the location. In the meantime Keelikōlani and Leleiohoku resided in another house on King Street until the house was completed, although most of her time was spent on the Big Island of Hawaii at the Hulihee Palace. Leleiohoku never saw the building completed, dying in 1877.

The main architect behind new structure was Charles J. Hardy, an American from Chicago, employed at the Enterprise Planing
Mill in Honolulu. The gaslit interior of the mansion was celebrated for its ornate plaster work and frescoes. It followed the Second Empire architecture, or so-called French style of architecture, and was considered a classical Victorian-style mansion. Surrounded by extensive, well-kept gardens, it was characterized by mansard roof, broad lanais, from which lofty flights of steps led down into the gardens, and a large drawing-room upon the ceiling of which was emblazoned the Hawaiian coat of arms.

In the spring of 1883 the building was completed. It was larger than the ʻIolani Palace. Ruth gave a grand luau to celebrate the event. This was followed by a ball in the evening, which was attended by all the best society of Honolulu, whether of native or foreign birth. But after these festivities the princess was taken suddenly ill, and left for Kailua on Hawaii island hoping to restore her health. She received medical attention, but did not recover. On 24 May her remains were brought back to Honolulu, and lay in state in the new house. It was later inherited by Princess Bernice Pauahi who died in it.

Today, the site of Keōua Hale is occupied by Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani Middle School, formerly known as Central Middle School.

<doc id="710020" wikidata="Q6780988" url="?curid=710020" title="Mary Worth">
<text>Mary Worth is an American newspaper comic strip that has had an eight-decade run from 1938. Distributed by King Features Syndicate, this soap opera-style strip influenced several that followed. It was created by writer Allen Saunders and artist Dale Connor, and initially appeared under the pseudonym &quot;Dale Allen&quot;. Ken Ernst succeeded Connor as artist in 1942.

&quot;Mary Worth&quot; is associated with an older comic strip, Apple Mary, sometimes subtitled &quot;Mary Worth&#x27;s Family&quot;, which dates from 1934 and features the character &quot;Apple Mary&quot; Worth, as well as several supporting characters who would continue into the new strip.

==Publication history==
=== Origins ===
Many reference sources state that &quot;Mary Worth&quot; was a continuation of Publishers Syndicate&#x27;s Depression-era strip &quot;Apple Mary&quot;, created by Martha Orr in 1934, centering on an old woman who sold apples on the street and offered humble common sense. Though usually called &quot;Apple Mary&quot;, the character&#x27;s full name is given as Mary Worth in at least one 1935 strip. &quot;Apple Mary&quot; ran through 1938, at which point, writes comics historian Don Markstein, &quot;It&#x27;s generally thought that under a new writer (Allen Saunders, whose credits include &quot;Kerry Drake&quot; and &quot;Steve Roper&quot;) and artist (Dale Connor, formerly Orr&#x27;s assistant), it gradually metamorphosed into &quot;Mary Worth&quot;. As late as February 1940, the strip appeared as &quot;Apple Mary&quot;, subtitled &quot;Mary Worth&#x27;s Family&quot;. (See example below.)

King Features, which began syndicating &quot;Mary Worth&quot; in 1987, gives the debut year of &quot;Mary Worth&quot; as 1938, denies any connection between the strips, saying, &quot;Contrary to popular belief, &quot;Mary Worth&quot; is not a continuation of the Depression-era favorite &quot;Apple Mary&quot;. The strip was created as a replacement feature offered to newspapers when Martha Orr, who created the dowdy apple peddler, retired. The only thing the new title character had in common with her predecessor was a first name.&quot;

There is, however, significant evidence that the two comic strips share an unbroken narrative featuring identical characters. Besides the character of Mary Worth herself, Mary&#x27;s grandson Dennie is featured in both comic strips, regularly appearing from 1934 to 1944, and reappearing as an adult in stories published from 1955-1957, 1959, 1961, and 1963. Mary&#x27;s son, &quot;Slim&quot; Worth, is featured in stories appearing in 1936–37, 1940–41, 1961–62, and 1963. Mary&#x27;s friend, Bill Biff, is featured in stories appearing between 1935 and 1944.

Saunders himself recalled that &quot;Apple Mary&quot; became &quot;Mary Worth&quot;:
By 1976, &quot;Mary Worth&quot; was being distributed by the Field Newspaper Syndicate to more than 300 newspapers worldwide.

=== Later history ===
Saunders retired in 1979 (and died in 1986), and Ernst died in 1985. Bill Ziegler, who did backgrounds on the strip for many years, took over the strip after Ernst&#x27;s death, continuing from 1986 to 1990. In 1987, King Features Syndicate began syndicating &quot;Mary Worth&quot;.

Other artists and writers who worked on the strip include Saunders&#x27; son, John Saunders (1974–2003), and Ernst&#x27;s son-in-law, Jim Armstrong (1991). Former DC Comics artist Joe Giella took over the art in 1991 with Karen Moy writing the strip as of the death of John Saunders in 2003.

Giella said in 2010:
Giella retired from drawing the strip in 2016, with his last strip appearing July 23. June Brigman and Roy Richardson, who had begun drawing the Sunday strips in May 2016, took over full-time artistic duties upon Giella&#x27;s retirement.

Under Allen Saunders, the daily strips usually had four panels with multiple exchanges among the characters and several stories per year. Under his son, the norm became two panels, with less dialog and stories stretching as long as 18 months. Moy has sought to reverse that &quot;glacial&quot; pace and to show Worth as not only a &quot;figure of common sense and compassion&quot; but also as &quot;human&quot; in her own flaws and experiencing &quot;jealousy, self-doubt, fear, and anger&quot;.

==Characters and story==

As scripted by Saunders, each story (and its cast) was largely independent, though some popular characters would reappear. Mary Worth herself, though always a presence in each story, was almost never the central character.

Typically, a story would revolve around the troubles of someone who was somehow in Mary&#x27;s orbit. Mary herself might not appear in the strip for weeks at a time, although she would eventually be around to give timely advice and support (or occasionally, a stern talking-to, if appropriate) to a character at a crucial point. The most popular early reoccurring characters were former showgirl Leona Stockpool (1939, 1942, 1948), spoiled actress Angel Varden (1941, 1942, 1949, 1969), and tough-talking show business writer, &quot;Brick&quot; Bricker (multiple stories between 1946 and 1953). Mary&#x27;s cousins, Hildy Worth Brant (multiple stories between 1955 and 1964) and Constance Moneta Hansen (multiple stories between 1958 and 1970), were also featured. Mary would visit her friends, Frank and Anne Crawford in Jennings, Ohio, roughly once a year between 1965 and 1979. While Mary generally made only brief appearances to react and give her matronly advice, she had occasional longer appearances that chronicled her unsuccessful romances: Colonel Everett Canfield (1942), &quot;Drum&quot; Greenwood (1949, 1950), and Admiral &quot;Reef&quot; Hansen (1959). 

When Saunders&#x27; son John fully took over the narrative, he had his largely nomadic heroine put down roots, becoming the in-house manager of the Charterstone Condominium Complex in 1979 in fictional Santa Royale, California. There, Mary serves as an observer of and adviser to her fellow residents, tackling issues such as drug and alcohol abuse, infidelity and teen pregnancy. Around the same time, the previous recurring characters were quietly dropped, including Mary&#x27;s son and grandson, who were essentially retconned out of existence. From 1979, the strip centered somewhat more on the title character than in previous years, along with a regular cast of her closest friends, most of whom were introduced to the strip after 1980: the genial but somewhat pompous Professor Ian Cameron and his insecure younger wife Toby (1980); buffoonish, romantically inept advice columnist Wilbur Weston and his college-student daughter Dawn (1993); and Dr. Jeff Cory, Mary&#x27;s perennial beau, and his two physician adult children, Drew and Adrian Cory (1996). All these characters would have featured storylines—Mary herself could still be absent from the strip for weeks at a time—as the strip developed into a soap opera-ish saga of the lives and loves of Mary&#x27;s long-term friends and the various Charterstone tenants. 

When Karen Moy took over the strip in 2003, she provided an updated background for Mary, establishing that the character is a former teacher, used to live in New York, and is the widow of Wall Street tycoon Jack Worth.

Moy&#x27;s handling of the strip during a 2006 plot line in which Mary was stalked by Aldo Kelrast (&quot;Kelrast&quot; being an anagram of &quot;stalker&quot;), a man rumored to have killed his late wife, drew media attention partly because of perceived unintentional humor due to the character&#x27;s resemblance to Captain Kangaroo. An intervention staged by Mary and her friends drove Aldo to returning to finding comfort in alcohol, which led to his death in a drunk driving incident, in which he drove off a cliff. A subsequent plot development was the arrival of Ella Byrd, another elderly dispenser of advice, who not only aroused feelings of jealousy and inadequacy in Mary, but also, as a psychic, alerted her to Dr. Jeff being in danger.

Later story lines introduced an additional foil, the alcoholic hospital administrator Jill whose anti-marriage diatribes (caused by her being jilted at the altar by her fiancé) put her into Mary&#x27;s orbit when she offers to help Jeff&#x27;s daughter plan her wedding. Others include plot lines regarding Internet addiction, Mary&#x27;s refusal to trade in her beloved PC for an iPad, and a lengthy story line where Mary must confront an old flame, whose meddling with his daughter&#x27;s love life led to her ex-boyfriend dying months later, alone and unloved.

==Comic books==
The &quot;Apple Mary&quot; comic strip was among those reprinted in some of the earliest American comic books, Eastern Color Printing&#x27;s &quot;Famous Funnies&quot;, in 1936, and continuing in Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Popular Comics&quot; and Western&#x27;s &quot;Mammoth Comics&quot; at least sporadically through 1938. &quot;Mary Worth&quot; would in turn be reprinted in comic books by Pines Publications, Magazine Enterprises, and Harvey Comics—initially as a backup feature in issues &quot;Green Hornet Comics&quot; and &quot;Black Cat&quot;, and later in &quot;Love Stories of Mary Worth&quot; #1-5 (Sept. 1949 - May 1950). More reprints followed in Argo Publications&#x27; single-issue &quot;Mary Worth&quot; (March 1956), and in the late 1990s in American Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Storyline Strips&quot;.

==Parodies==
In a run of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; Sunday strips in 1957, Al Capp lampooned &quot;Mary Worth&quot; as &quot;Mary Wart&quot;. The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody, with a caricature of Allen Saunders portraying her put-upon, long-suffering son-in-law. Saunders returned Capp&#x27;s fire with the introduction of the character &quot;Hal Rapp,&quot; a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist (Capp was a teetotaler). Later, the feud was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders &quot;feud&quot; fooled both editors and readers, generating plenty of free publicity for both strips—and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed. 

A 1988 storyline of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; comic strip had a boy character trying to sell comic strips to J. Jonah Jameson; one strip was called &quot;Mary Worse&quot;.

In season two, episode six of the television series &quot;Taxi&quot;, Louie accuses Alex of being &quot;Mary Worth&quot; when he becomes a referee to Tony and Bobby&#x27;s love triangle.

An episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart Sells His Soul&quot;, features Comic Book Guy displaying &quot;a very rare Mary Worth in which she has advised a friend to commit suicide&quot;. In another episode, &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;, he trades a Mary Worth telephone to Bart Simpson for an Itchy and Scratchy animation cel. In the episode &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Criticize Dinner?&quot;, the tour of the Springfield Shopper leads them to the comic department which is headed by the author of Mary Worth. The guide asks: &quot;Who reads &quot;Mary Worth&quot;?&quot;, to which the group remains silent, and the guide says: &quot;Let&#x27;s move on.&quot; 

In the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Why of Fry&quot;, Fry remarks: &quot;There are guys in the background of &quot;Mary Worth&quot; comics that are more important than me,&quot; upon finding out that Leela, his love interest, is about to go on a date with an important mayor&#x27;s aide. 

In a &quot;FoxTrot&quot; strip, the characters are discussing how many comic strips that day have jokes based on golf. Jason comments: &quot;I loved Mary Worth&#x27;s line about sand traps.&quot; In another &quot;FoxTrot&quot; strip, after being bombarded by Jason&#x27;s suggestions, the newspapers give Mary Worth vampire fangs. In a &quot;Pearls Before Swine&quot; strip, Rat, on steroids, decides he &quot;will kick Mary Worth&#x27;s &amp;#$*%!&quot; 

In a &quot;Far Side&quot; strip, two characters, both of whom are styled after &quot;Mary Worth&quot; characters, are seen at the door of a typical Far Side character (with a pet cow and snake), who tells them &quot;You must be looking for &quot;&quot;Apartment 3-G&quot; or &quot;Mary Worth&quot; or one of those other serious cartoons&quot;. In an &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; Sunday strip, Verne ends with &quot;Maybe Mary Worth needs a pet turtle&quot; (signifying his frustration with his co-characters&#x27; disconnection from reality) after RJ and Hammy discusses rather surrealistically around the life of missing socks, as if the socks were individual life forms on their own.

An issue of &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; features a &quot;Mary Worth&quot; strip with a comatose Mary. Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat comments that she hasn&#x27;t been the same since her stroke.

In response to readers of &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in Shreveport, Louisiana, voting to drop &quot;Mary Worth&quot;, the comic strip &quot;The New Adventures of Queen Victoria&quot; devoted its September 25–29, 2007 strips to Victoria planning Mary&#x27;s funeral.

The strip was spoofed as &quot;Mary Worthless&quot; on a 1975 episode of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.
