===2000–current===
==U.S.–Native American treaties==
From 1778 to 1871, the United States government entered into more than 500 treaties with the Native American tribes; all of these treaties have since been violated in some way or outright broken by the U.S. government, with Native Americans and First Nations peoples still fighting for their treaty rights in federal courts and at the United Nations.

In addition to treaties, which are ratified by the U.S. Senate and signed by the U.S. President, there were also Acts of Congress and Executive Orders which dealt with land agreements. The U.S. military and representatives of a tribe, or sub unit of a tribe, signed documents which were understood at the time to be treaties, rather than armistices, ceasefires and truces.

:The entries from 1784 to 1895 were initially created by information gathered by Charles C. Royce and published in the U.S. Serial Set, Number 4015, 56th Congress, 1st Session, in 1899. The purpose of the &quot;Schedule of Indian Land Cessions&quot; was to indicate the location of each cession by or reservation for the Indian Tribes. Royce&#x27;s column headings are titled: &quot;Date, Where or how concluded, Reference, Tribe, Description of cession or reservation, historical data and remarks, Designation of cession on map, Number, Location&quot;.

The Ratified Indian Treaties that were transferred from the U.S. State Department to the National Archives were recently conserved and imaged for the first time, and in 2020 made available online with additional context at the Indigenous Digital Archive&#x27;s Treaties Explorer, or DigiTreaties.org.

Treaty-making between various Native American governments and the United States officially concluded on March 3, 1871 with the passing of the United States Code Title 25, Chapter 3, Subchapter 1, Section 71 (). Pre-existing treaties were grandfathered, and further agreements were made under domestic law.

<text>Bronze race () is a term used since the early 20th century by Hispanic American writers of the &quot;indigenista&quot; and &quot;americanista&quot; schools to refer to the mestizo population that arose in the Americas with the arrival of Latin European (particularly Spanish) settlers and their intermingling with the New World&#x27;s Amerindian peoples.

Mexican poet Amado Nervo wrote &quot;La Raza de Bronce&quot; (&quot;The Bronze Race&quot;) as an elegiac poem in honor of former president Benito Juárez in 1902. Bolivian &quot;indigenista&quot; writer Alcides Arguedas used the term in his 1919 work, &quot;La Raza de Bronce&quot;, a study of the natives of the Andean Altiplano. It was later used by Mexican luminary José Vasconcelos in &quot;La Raza Cósmica&quot; (1925).

The term was revived in the 1960s by Chicano ethnic group MEChA to refer to Mexican Americans in the United States and the people in Mexico as a unified &quot;race&quot;, similar to the black and white races. In this sense it is largely synonymous to the notion of the Chicano nation. The decision to call it a separate &quot;race&quot; may have been influenced by the contemporary negative views of &quot;ethnic&quot; or &quot;nation&quot; based nationalism and positive views of &quot;race&quot; based nationalism. The notion was first enunciated in the Plan Espiritual de Aztlán document.

<text>Robert Kelker-Kelly (born April 18, 1964) is a former American soap opera actor and current professional aircraft pilot, best known for playing Bo Brady on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1992 to 1995. He is also known for his portrayals of Sam Fowler (originating the role) from 1987 to 1990 and Dr. Shane Roberts from 1996 to 1998 on &quot;Another World&quot;, and for the role of Stavros Cassadine on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 2001 to 2003 and 2013 to 2014.

==Early life==
He was born to Jonetta Kelker, a nurse, and Robert Kelly, a pathologist. He has 3 sisters. His parents divorced when he was 7 years old, and he moved in with his dad. At 11, when his father remarried, Kelker-Kelly, moved back with his mother. Three months later his dad died at 42 from a heart attack.

Kelker-Kelly attended Wichita Collegiate School in Wichita, Kansas from 1977 to 1980, where he was active in the theatre and had major roles in several plays, including Rusty in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, Bill Sikes in &quot;Oliver!&quot; and Sir Lionel in &quot;Camelot&quot;. He briefly attended the University of Kansas but decided to forgo college in favor of pursuing his acting career. In 1988, he married Linda Rattner; the couple divorced in 1992.

After dating actress Miriam Parrish for years, the couple married in 1997. The same year he left Los Angeles and his acting career briefly behind. He earned a certification in airframe and powerplant mechanics. From 2002 to 2003 he was an acting teacher at the Pioneer Valley Performing Arts Charter Public School in South Hadley, Massachusetts.

Kelker-Kelly became a professional pilot, working in that field from 2003 to 2015. He is type rated in the GIV, LR60, LR45, CE560 and CE500. He is still an active pilot and teaches people how to fly.

==Career==
Kelker made his acting debut in 1987 as Sam Fowler on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, a role he originally played from 1987 to 1990. The character of Sam was involved in a front-burner story with socialite Amanda Cory.

In 1992, Kelker-Kelly was chosen to portray Bo Brady, an established role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; that was being vacated by the creator of the role, actor Peter Reckell. Although Kelker-Kelly was a recast, fans accepted his portrayal of Bo. The character&#x27;s pairing with Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso) and reformed bad girl Billie Reed (Lisa Rinna) was a popular storyline and garnered Kelker-Kelly his widest audience. He was replaced by Peter Reckell in August 1995. In 1996 he returned to &quot;Another World&quot; playing a new role, that of professional race car driver Bobby Reno, who was later discovered to actually be Dr. Shane Roberts. He played the role until 1998.

He portrayed Stavros Cassadine on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 2001, with guest spots in 2002, 2003, 2013 and 2014.

<text>Norfolk County, Massachusetts Colony was one of the original four counties created in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The land was originally granted as separate from Massachusetts, but boundary disputes among the settlers led to their petitioning to join the colonial government to the south. The county was created by the Massachusetts General Court on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered &quot;that the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four sheires&quot;.

Norfolk County contained the settlements of Salisbury, Hampton, Haverhill, Exeter, Dover, and Portsmouth. It effectively encompassed all settlements from the Merrimack River, north to the Piscataqua River, and extending inland about a dozen miles. In 1680, the Province of New Hampshire was formally separated from Massachusetts, with Norfolk County forming the core. Massachusetts retained the northern bank of Merrimack River and the towns of Salisbury and Haverhill were added to Essex County. Hampton, Exeter, Dover, and Portsmouth were governed at two levels, town and province/colony, until 1769, when New Hampshire was itself divided into counties, so that Norfolk ceased to exist.

The former Norfolk County is often referred to as &quot;Old Norfolk County.&quot;

Four volumes of records of the Old Norfolk County exist and are at the Essex County Registry of Deeds in Salem. They have been electronically imaged into JPG image files but are not yet online. These four record books were also abstracted by Sidney Perley in &quot;The Essex Antiquarian&quot;. This magazine (published 1897 to 1911) has also been electronically imaged and some volumes are available at Google Books.

A new, unrelated county was established as Norfolk County, Massachusetts from most of the southern portion of Suffolk County in 1793.

<doc id="704820" wikidata="Q1537553" url="?curid=704820" title="Gooderham Building">
<text>The Gooderham Building, also known as the Flatiron Building, is an historic office building at 49 Wellington Street East in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the eastern edge of the city&#x27;s Financial District (east of Yonge Street) in the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, wedged between Front Street and Wellington Street in Downtown Toronto, where they join up to form a triangular intersection. Completed in 1892, the red-brick edifice was an early example of a prominent flatiron building.

The Gooderham Building is the focal point of one of Toronto&#x27;s most iconic vistas: looking west down Front Street towards the building&#x27;s prominent rounded corner, framed on the sides by the heritage commercial blocks along Front Street, and with the skyscrapers of the Financial District towering in the background. The CN Tower is also visible from certain angles behind Brookfield Place. This vista frequently appears in imagery of the city.

==History==

The previous building on the site was shorter, but in the same shape, and it was called the Coffin Block. The current building was designed by architect David Roberts Jr. and originally cost $18,000 to construct for distiller George Gooderham Sr. (1830–1905), a son of the Gooderham and Worts distillery&#x27;s founder, William Gooderham. The building served as the office of the Gooderham and Worts distillery until 1952, and it was sold by the Gooderham family in 1957.

Bought in 1975 and saved (and partially restored) by David Walsh and Robert Phillips, further restoration took place in 1998 by owners Michael and Anne Tippin. The building was designated a historic site under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in 1975, then the Ontario Heritage Foundation attained a Heritage Easement in 1977. It was subsequently owned and managed by the Woodcliffe Corporation.

On 12 October 2011, the Woodcliffe Corporation announced that it would be selling the building. Previously, the building had sold for $10.1 million in 2005, and for $2.2 million in 1999. The building is currently owned and managed by Lee Chow Group.

==Architecture and art==
The Gooderham Building is well-known both for its narrow wedge shape and for the mural on its back wall. &quot;The Flatiron Mural&quot; by renowned Canadian artist Derek Michael Besant uses a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; effect to not only make the wall appear to have more windows than it does, but to also give it a more mobile effect by having its edges &#x27;fluttering&#x27; away where they are not &#x27;tacked&#x27; down. It is a picture of the Perkins Building, which is located directly across the street.

The building has a Romanesque cornice and frieze above the arched windows on the 4th floor. The main entrance located on Wellington Street makes use of a French Gothic archway. The foundation is made of sandstone. The steep copper roof has eight gable dormers: four on the south facade and four on the north facade.

With its linear pattern of fenestration distributed equally on all floors, it conveys a light feeling of a corporate office building. The Gooderham Building is set on a high foundation that reaches half a storey above the ground. These days, it is still being used as an office building. The 1st floor uses rectangular sliding windows on the south side, but it has fixed windows on the north side. Conversely, on the 2nd floor, it uses fixed windows on the south side and rectangular sliders on the north side. On the 3rd, 4th and 5th floors, the Gooderham Building has single-hung and arch-hung windows.

The Gooderham Building has three entrances. Two of the entrances lead to the pub in the basement known as The Flatiron and Firkin. Entrance doors are in pairs, and have wooden frames for windows. The pub in the basement has a large patio around the south side of the building. Entrances for the pub are located in the basement and the 1st floor on the Front Street side. There is no public access to the pub from the building. The entrance for the Flatiron Building is located on the north side, and is made up of fanciful pinnacle dormers and arch frames with French Gothic styling.

==Berczy Park==
Berczy Park is a small park located behind the Gooderham Building at Front Street and Wellington Street in Toronto. The site was home to several buildings with the most notable being the Clarendon Hotel around the mid-19th century. By the late 19th century and early 20th century, commercial buildings ranging from offices, wholesalers, jewellers and lithographers occupied the area:

* Pacific Buildings at 26 to 34 Front - demolished between 1966 and 1967
* unnamed offices at 36-38 Front
* Sterns Building at 40-42 Front - home jeweller Samuel Stern until 1910 and demolished between 1962 and 1963
* unnamed silverware factory and offices at 44 Front
* unnamed wholesalers at 46-48 Front
* Janus (later as Frontwell) Building at 50 Front - demolished between 1966 and 1967

Once these buildings were demolished the site became a vacant lot and then as parking lot in the mid-1960s and informal grass lot by 1975, but did not become a city park with a few benches and walled sections in 1980. The current tree-lined city park was added and renovations, completed in 2017, added a large three-tier fountain designed by Montreal landscape architect Claude Cormier. The fountain features 27 cast-iron dogs spouting water, a cast-iron cat looking at two bird sculptures on a nearby wire, and a bone crowning the fountain. The fountain, which features a trough for dogs to drink from, became a popular destination, particularly for dog lovers.

<doc id="704826" wikidata="Q917761" url="?curid=704826" title="Dulce de leche">
<text>Dulce de leche (), caramelized milk, milk candy, or milk jam is a confectionery popular in Latin America, France, Poland, and the Philippines prepared by slowly heating sugar and milk over several hours. The substance takes on a spreadable, sauce-like consistency and derives its rich flavour and colour from non-enzymatic browning. It is typically used to top or fill other sweet foods.

Since 1998, and at the initiative of the Argentine Center for the Promotion of Dulce de Leche and Related Products, International Dulce de Leche Day is celebrated every October .

== Names and similar confections ==
Spanish &quot;dulce de leche&quot; and Portuguese &quot;doce de leite&quot; () mean &quot;sweet [made] of milk&quot;. Other names in Spanish include &quot;manjar&quot; (&quot;delicacy&quot;), &quot;arequipe&quot; and &quot;leche quemada&quot; (&quot;burnt milk&quot;, a term popular in Mexico); also in Mexico and some Central American countries &quot;dulce de leche&quot; made with goat&#x27;s milk is called &#x27;cajeta&#x27;.

In the Philippines, &quot;dulce de leche&quot; made with carabao (water buffalo) milk is called &quot;dulce gatas&quot;, and is a specialty of Negros Occidental province.

In French, it is called &quot;confiture de lait&quot; (milk jam). In France, it is traditional in the regions of Normandy and Savoy, where it is commonly served with &quot;fromage blanc&quot; or crêpes.

The same confectionery is also known as &quot;kajmak&quot; in Polish cuisine, named after Turkish kaymak, a kind of clotted cream. &quot;Kajmak&quot; is most commonly used for wafers or the mazurek pie traditionally eaten at Easter.

== History == 
There are various stories about its origin. Some reports say it originated in Indonesia in the 6th century. Later it would have been brought to the Philippines, Spain, and finally into Latin America. Apocryphal stories also suggest it was brought to the Americas by important historical figures like Napoleon or Argentinian general Juan Manuel de Rosas.

In 2003, Argentina attempted to declare dulce de leche as national patrimony but countries across South America and Central America objected due to its popularity all over the continent.

== Preparation ==
The most basic recipe calls for slowly simmering milk and sugar, stirring almost constantly until the sugar dissolves (baking soda then can be added), after more constant stirring (between 1.5 – 2 hours) until the mixture thickens and finally turns a rich brown golden-brown colour.

Other ingredients such as vanilla may be added for flavor. Much of the water in the milk evaporates and the mix thickens; the resulting &quot;dulce de leche&quot; is usually about a sixth of the volume of the milk used. The transformation that occurs in preparation is caused by a combination of two common non-enzymatic browning reactions called caramelization and the Maillard reaction. 

Another method of preparation, similar to Russian boiled condensed milk known as &quot;varyonaya sgushchyonka&quot;, involves using canned or boxed sweetened condensed milk and cooking it in a pressure cooker for 20 to 25 minutes for a light color and slightly soft consistency, or 40 to 45 minutes for a darker color and firmer consistency. If using condensed milk from a box, it should be wrapped in about 5 to 6 layers of aluminum foil to prevent it from bursting.

It is also possible to place the condensed milk in a glass jar and boil it in the pressure cooker. In this method, different ingredients can also be added to the sweetened condensed milk, such as shredded coconut or peanuts. However, certain precautions need to be taken, such as wrapping the jar with a kitchen towel and lining the pressure cooker with another kitchen towel so that the bottom of the jar does not touch the cooker (as contact may cause the glass to shatter). The cooking time is similar to the previous method (around 35 to 40 minutes). Water should be added to the pressure cooker – enough to cover the cans, boxes, or jars of condensed milk. A small amount of vinegar can be added to the water in the pressure cooker to prevent it from becoming discolored at the bottom. In all cases, once ready, it is important to let the &quot;dulce de leche&quot; cool completely, which takes about 2 hours.

== Use ==
&quot;Dulce de leche&quot; can be eaten alone, but is more commonly used as a topping or filling for other sweet foods, such as cakes, churros, cookies (see &quot;alfajor&quot;), waffles, flan cakes (aka crème caramel (known as &quot;pudim&quot; among Portuguese-speakers) (not to be confused with British pie-like variant of flan), fruits like bananas and candied figs, and ice creams; it is also a popular spread on crepes (panqueques), obleas (wafers), and toast.

<text>In politics, the terms war hawk and hawk describe a person who favours starting armed conflicts or escalating ongoing ones instead of attempting to solve problems through dialogue or other nonviolent methods. Hawkish individuals are the opposite of war doves, who advocate negotiations and peaceful settlements to resolve disputes and view the option of going to war as one to be avoided by any means unless absolutely necessary. The terms are derived by historical analogy with the birds of the same name: hawks are predatory birds that attack and eat other animals, whereas doves eat seeds and fruit and are a symbol of peace.

Variations of the term include chicken hawk, referring to a person who supports waging war but previously avoided or is actively avoiding military service (i.e., cowardice); and liberal hawk, referring to a person who adheres to passive liberalism in domestic politics while simultaneously having a militaristic and interventionist foreign policy.

==Historical group==
The term &quot;war hawk&quot; was coined in 1792 and was often used to ridicule politicians who favored a pro-war policy in peacetime. Historian Donald R. Hickey found 129 uses of the term in American newspapers before late 1811, mostly from Federalists warning against Democratic-Republican foreign policy. Some antiwar Democratic-Republicans used it, such as Virginia Congressman John Randolph of Roanoke. There was never any &quot;official&quot; roster of War Hawks; as Hickey notes, &quot;Scholars differ over who (if anyone) ought to be classified as a War Hawk.&quot; However, most historians use the term to describe about one or two dozen members of the Twelfth Congress. The leader of this faction was Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina was another notable War Hawk. Both of these men became major players in American politics for decades, despite failing to win the presidency themselves. Other men traditionally identified as War Hawks include Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky, William Lowndes of South Carolina, Langdon Cheves of South Carolina, Felix Grundy of Tennessee, and William W. Bibb of Georgia.

President James Madison set the legislative agenda for Congress, providing committees in the House of Representatives with policy recommendations to be introduced as bills on the House floor. Nevertheless, he was regarded as a &quot;timid soul&quot; and tried to restrain the martial zeal of the War Hawks.

==Variations of the term==
The term has also been expanded into &quot;chicken hawk&quot;, referring to a war hawk who avoided military service. 

The term &quot;liberal hawk&quot; is a derivation of the traditional phrase, in the sense that it denotes an individual with socially liberal inclinations coupled with an aggressive outlook on foreign policy.

In modern American usage, &quot;hawk&quot; refers to a fierce advocate for a cause or policy, such as &quot;deficit hawk&quot; or &quot;privacy hawk&quot;. It may also refer to a person or political leader who favors a strong or aggressive military policy, though not necessarily outright war.

<doc id="704834" wikidata="Q7200914" url="?curid=704834" title="Plan de Santa Bárbara">
<text>El Plan de Santa Bárbara: A Chicano Plan for Higher Education is a 155-page document, which was written in 1969 by the Chicano Coordinating Council on Higher Education. Drafted at the University of California Santa Barbara, it is a blueprint for the inception of Chicana/o studies programs in colleges and universities throughout the US. The Chicano Coordinating Council expresses political mobilization to be dependent upon political consciousness, thus the institution of education is targeted as the platform to raise political conscious amongst Chicanos and spur higher learning to political action. The Plan proposes a curriculum in Chicano studies, the role of community control in Chicano education and the necessity of Chicano political independence. The document was a framework for educational and curriculum goals for the Chicano movements within the institution of education, while being the foundation for the Chicano student group Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán (MEChA).

The plan itself begins with a manifesto which calls for a renaissance and a &quot;quest for cultural expression and freedom&quot; and continues by pushing back against racist power structures and assimilation and a push toward the importance of community and pride in Chicanismo. The manifesto asks the colleges and universities within state of California to act in the following areas:
:1. Admission and recruitment of Chicano students, faculty, administrators, and staff;
:2. A curriculum program and an academic major relevant to the Chicano cultural and historical experience;
:3. Support and tutorial programs;
:4. Research programs;
:5. Publications programs; and
:6. Community, cultural, and social action programs.

Finally, it calls for students, faculty, employees and the community to come together as &quot;central and decisive designers and administrators of these programs&quot;.

Following the manifesto, the document lays out a plan for organizing Chicano programs; recruitment and admissions, support programs, curriculum, political action, the outline of the degrees offered including a Bachelor of Arts and an associate degree, and proposed courses including those for Chicano history, contemporary politics of the Southwest, and Mexican American sociology. The document closes with an outline of a Barrio Center program which aims to reach out to students outside of the colleges and universities in regards to dissemination of college entrance information, community engagement and the presence of on-going research proposed by Chicano scholars. Throughout the plan are pictures of those in the Chicano movement as well as art drawn by members of MEChA. This manifesto was adopted in April 1969.

== Critical response ==
Indigenous history and traditional myths were used in the Chicano movement to create a nationalist political identity based on reclaiming cultures and histories. They were also purposed to imagine Aztlán, the mythical homeland for Chicana/o people, as both a physical place and a nexus for change in educational and academic communities. The concept of Aztlán is given a home in higher education, as those who created this plan were “students, faculty, administrators, and community delegates representing…La Alta California, Aztlán.” This text includes myriad references to “La Raza de Aztlán” and indigenous ways of knowing across subjects. Proposed curricula include indigenous histories of science, sociology, architecture, and music, among many other subjects. Because of this, some argue that the Chicano movement was exemplified and institutionalized through projects like El Plan de Santa Bárbara. Imagining the future of education is described as a matter of social justice for Chicana/o authors, as it is a way for them to imagine a world outside of colonial constructs. Thus, professors, students, and administrators from UC Santa Barbara and Chicana/o Studies departments across the country reference El Plan de Santa Bárbara as a key player in the institutionalization of Chicano ideology and its recognition across the Southwest and within the academic community. Given the context of Chicana/o exclusion in academia, this plan is described as an explicit call for equity. 

== Critiques ==
Despite the emphasis on equality in higher education curricula, the androcentrism and heteronormativity of the Chicano movement is recognized and critiqued as a site for future improvement in which a diverse Chicana/o population can be included. Academics of Chicana/o Studies argue that the exclusion of women and the LGBT community in Chicano manifestos such as El Plan de Santa Bárbara and El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán embody the limitations of the future this movement was working towards, as it was exclusionary. Chicana feminism is explained as a response to the limitations of texts like El Plan de Santa Bárbara, such that Chicana feminists had to work to reassert overlooked identities in contemporary and future discussions of Chicana/o movements for social change. UC Santa Barbara’s Office of Public Affairs and Communications maintains that the work of the movement is still in progress, and professors argue that, while El Plan has solidified the presence of Chicana/o Studies in higher education, further implementation of the original plan’s true intentions of community-building will lead to more inclusive representation of Chicana/o students.

<text>Devonshire County, Massachusetts was a short-lived county formed in 1674 during colonial territorial disputes between the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Province of New York. The county existed from 1674 to 1675, and encompassed land claimed by Massachusetts between the Kennebec River and Penobscot Bay in what is now Maine. This overlapped the New York claim, which extended from the Kennebec to the Saint Croix River (Maine&#x27;s present easternmost boundary). Settlements in the territory were attacked during King Philip&#x27;s War (1675-1676) and the area was abandoned until the 18th century. It was incorporated into the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692, which initially governed it as part of York County. The area is now divided into a number of Maine counties.

<text>The Plan Espiritual de Aztlán (English: &quot;Spiritual Plan of Aztlán&quot;) was a pro-indigenist manifesto advocating Chicano nationalism and self-determination for Mexican Americans. It was adopted by the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference, a March 1969 convention hosted by Rodolfo Gonzales&#x27;s Crusade for Justice in Denver, Colorado.

==Background==
In 1848, the Mexican–American War created the Xicano with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on Feb 2 of that year. In a land colonized by three European/Western nations (Spain, France and the United States), the original occupants of these lands began to rebuild their own national identity, an identity focused on ancient ties to the occupied Americas and indigeneity. Ernesto Mireles says, &quot;For the portion of the Xicano/a community engaged in resistance writing, the necessities of survival under colonial rule have overshadowed Aztlán and its mythology for centuries.&quot; The tie to the land known as Aztlan (Southwest United States, Northern Mexico) had emerged in the contemporary Xicano Movement as a pre-Cuauhtemoc trope and gives claim of this occupied territory to Xicano and Indigenous peoples. Beginning with the Chicano power movement of the 1960s and 70s the Xicano re-emerged as indigenous and no longer a foreigner of their own land.

The Xicano power movement of the 1960s and 1970s was a continuation of the centuries-old question surrounding the natural inheritance of indigenous people and national identity. This conversation around Indigenous national liberation and the expulsion of foreign invaders has a long history over the past 500 years. The Provisional Directorate of the Plan of San Diego, Texas written in 1915 states, &quot;we will arise in arms against the government, and country of the United States of North America, one as all and all as one, proclaiming the liberty of the individuals of the black race and its independence of yankee tyranny which has held us in iniquitous slavery since remote times&quot;. This plan was written as the battle of the west started to come to a close and the settling was almost done. This is one declaration of a sovereignty prior to the plan de Aztlan by a formerly sovereign people that continues the discussion of natural inheritance.

== National liberation ==
El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan is about national liberation. Aztlan is only good to build power for the Xicano Movement. As Corky Gonzalez quotes,

”The publication of a revolutionary paper is equal to the taking of a city. The proclamation of a political plan is the same as the bloodiest combat. . . they form equal parts of a rebellion and are inherent in it. . . I have never seen, nor will I ever see a revolution without the propagation of ideas as a preliminary, and the shedding of blood, as the inevitable means of deciding the outcome” Cultural and political mobilization is the goal of this document. The idea of Aztlan has survived numerous conquests and hundreds of years of settler-colonial oppression which means the tie to land and indigeneity is the engine to mobilization.

The goal of national mobilization is to create a nation a return to history. Declaring full sovereignty of the south west from the settler nation of the United States of America. The revolutionary caucus of the 1969 Chicano Youth Conference states,

“We, a non-conquered people living in a conquered land, come together hoping that a plan of liberation, a concrete revolutionary program acceptable to the entire southwest, will from this conference. Subjected to a system that has denied our human dignity, our rights are also being denied under a constitution which we had no part in formulating but more fundamentally the rights protected under the Guadalupe-Hidalgo treaty which grants the right to cultural autonomy have been violated. For 144 years we have been trying to peacefully coexist yet no peace has come to our communities. Revolution is the only means available to us. We owe no allegiance, no respect, to any of the laws of this racist country. Our liberation struggle is a war of Survival.” The Revolutionary caucus is calling for action such as described in El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan. They are calling for the complete succession of Xicano and Indigenous land from a nation that does not recognize them as fully human. 
Succession only works with the complete national sovereignty of a people and fully removed for the structure created to oppress the Indigenous / Xicano. The creation of a new national identity and the creation of a nation. It is laid out by Gonzalez as,

“La Crusada Para La Justicia exists as an expression of some members of La Raza consciously creating social systems that are parallel to and independent of the anglo systems imposed by war, annexation, and conquest. It offers a wide range of services: education, counseling, legal, medical, and financial: it focuses as a center for art, music, and drama: it builds barrio identity, political power, economic muscle.”
This statement offers Xicanos / Xicanas a basis of what to accomplish and how to build power for the Xicano / Indigenous communities.

Aztlan is firmly the idea of indigeneity and natural inheritance to a land stolen by occupying power. Aztlan gives the Xicano / Indigenous community power to build national liberation movement. Rodolfo Gonzalez writes, 
“Aztlan, a mythical land of the Aztecs? Aztlan an abstract illusion of a Nation? Aztlan a common denominator that la gente de La Raza, the mestizo, the Chicano can agree upon is not based on a phantasma of romantic delusions it is conceived on the foundations of history and the reality of its existence can and will be proven by law; not a law based on political courts of injustice and cold anglo legalities, but based on human fact and historical inheritance.” In other words, Aztlan means to build power, and this power is based on historical facts and rightness. The land of the Mexica, Dine, Hopi, Apache, Yaqui, Yavapai, and many more.

== Organizational goals ==
This list of organizational goals is pulled directly from the El Plan de Aztlan document itself.

&quot;1. UNITY in the thinking of our people concerning the barrios, the pueblo, the campo, the land, the poor, the middle class, the professional-all committed to the liberation of La Raza.

2. ECONOMY: economic control of our lives and our communities can only come about by driving the exploiter out of our communities, our pueblos, and our lands and by controlling and developing our own talents, sweat, and resources. Cultural background and values which ignore materialism and embrace humanism will contribute to the act of cooperative buying and the distribution of resources and production to sustain an economic base for healthy growth and development Lands rightfully ours will be fought for and defended. Land and realty ownership will be acquired by the community for the people&#x27;s welfare. Economic ties of responsibility must be secured by nationalism and the Chicano defense units.

3. EDUCATION must be relative to our people, i.e., history, culture, bilingual education, contributions, etc. Community control of our schools, our teachers, our administrators, our counselors, and our programs.

4. INSTITUTIONS shall serve our people by providing the service necessary for a full life and their welfare on the basis of restitution, not handouts or beggar&#x27;s crumbs. Restitution for past economic slavery, political exploitation, ethnic and cultural psychological destruction and denial of civil and human rights. Institutions in our community which do not serve the people have no place in the community. The institutions belong to the people.

5. SELF-DEFENSE of the community must rely on the combined strength of the people. The front line defense will come from the barrios, the campos, the pueblos, and the ranchitos. Their involvement as protectors of their people will be given respect and dignity. They in turn offer their responsibility and their lives for their people. Those who place themselves in the front ranks for their people do so out of love and carnalismo. Those institutions which are fattened by our brothers to provide employment and political pork barrels for the gringo will do so only as acts of liberation and for La Causa. For the very young there will no longer be acts of juvenile delinquency, but revolutionary acts.

6. CULTURAL values of our people strengthen our identity and the moral backbone of the movement. Our culture unites and educates the family of La Raza towards liberation with one heart and one mind. We must insure that our writers, poets, musicians, and artists produce literature and art that is appealing to our people and relates to our revolutionary culture. Our cultural values of life, family, and home will serve as a powerful weapon to defeat the gringo dollar value system and encourage the process of love and brotherhood.

7. POLITICAL LIBERATION can only come through independent action on our part, since the two-party system is the same animal with two heads that feed from the same trough. Where we are a majority, we will control; where we are a minority, we will represent a pressure group; nationally, we will represent one party: La Familia de La Raza!&quot;

==Origin and adoption==
During the conference, a young poet named Alurista, born in Mexico but raised in San Diego, took the stage. To a captivated audience, he read the words, In the spirit of a new people that is conscious not only of its proud historical heritage but also of the brutal &quot;gringo&quot; invasion of our territories, we, the Chicano inhabitants and civilizers of the northern land of Aztlan from whence came our forefathers, reclaiming the land of their birth and consecrating the determination of our people of the sun, declare that the call of our blood is our power, our responsibility, and our inevitable destiny.

The poem, &quot;El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán&quot;, became the title of the manifesto, and the poem became its preamble. Alurista went on to become the &quot;poet laureate of Aztlán&quot;.

<text>Eric Williams Plaza, also known as the Eric Williams Financial Complex, located on Independence Square, Port of Spain, consists of two of the tallest buildings in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as in the English-speaking Caribbean. It consists of a pair of skyscrapers 22 stories high and 302 ft (92 m) tall, locally known as the &quot;Twin Towers&quot;. Construction on the complex started in 1979 and ended in 1986. The complex was officially opened on March 29, 1986. The architect who managed the construction was Anthony C. Lewis Partnership.

The Eric Williams Plaza was named after Eric Williams, the first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago. The first tower houses the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago while the second tower houses the Ministry of Finance. The first tower&#x27;s official name is Eric Williams Financial Tower and the second tower&#x27;s official name is the Central Bank Tower. The building surrounding the towers is the old Central Bank. The old Central Bank building has gold and currency vaults, administrative areas, an auditorium and a concert hall. It is one of the finest facilities in the country. It is also part of the complex. Both towers contain building security, communications, and life-safety systems.

The towers have an earthquake resistant design. The cross braces and core walls in both towers are designed to take earthquake forces with the former taking 15% of the forces and the latter taking 85%. Additionally, great care was taken in the detailing of the reinforcement.
The thickness of the basement under each tower is 25&#x27;. The pile cap under each tower is a cellular raft which is a combination of 9&#x27; × 6&#x27; beams and an 18&quot; slab. Water storage for the complex is located in the basements of the towers.

The building is located on the Brian Lara Promenade, Independence Square (formerly Marine Square) in downtown Port of Spain. It was the tallest building in Trinidad and Tobago until the Nicholas Tower was constructed by businessman Issa Nicholas.

From 1993 to January 1999, the office of the Prime Minister was housed here; in 1999 it was returned to the Whitehall.

==Central Bank Auditorium==
The Central Bank Auditorium constructed in 1986 still stands as one of the finest facilities of its type in the country. The facility was constructed not only to serve the Bank&#x27;s needs, but also as a civic contribution aimed at enhancing the performing arts in Trinidad and Tobago.

The Auditorium is located at the South-East corner of the Central Bank building. It has a seating capacity for 400 and provides computerised lighting and sound controls. The Auditorium also boasts of an infra-red listening system designed to facilitate the hearing impaired.

The Lights
The lighting system comprises some of the top brand names in the world of theatrical lighting. An ETC Expression 3 Lighting Console is at the head of the system with an array of lighting fixtures by manufacturers such as Colortran, Altman, Rainbow, Clay Paky and ETC Source Fours, High End.

A 96 dimmer per circuit system exists. These circuits are distributed along the balcony rail, side ports, forestage grid and deck.

The Sound
The Central Bank Auditorium is at the forefront of the industry, being the only theatre in the country with a Digital Audio Workstation composed of Digidesign and MacIntosh systems. Two Tascam DM24 Digital Consoles head the list of highly professional audio equipment used at the Auditorium. The Auditorium also has an array of microphones, tape machines and amplifiers.

The Auditorium also boasts of an Infra-Red Listening System designed to facilitate the hearing impaired.

The Dressing Rooms
Refurbishing of the Dressing Room area has recently been completed, with a more modern layout and comfort to performers. Performances onstage can be monitored in both the Dressing Rooms and Green Room areas via ideally located video and audio monitors. Intercom service is also provided in these areas.

The Facilities
Some of the facilities provided with the Auditorium include:

A Steinway Baby Grand Piano,
In House Technical Crew,
In House Bar Service,
Janitorial Service,
Security.

<doc id="704916" wikidata="Q33559" url="?curid=704916" title="Ingrian language">
<text>Ingrian (, ), also called Izhorian (, , ), is a Finnic language spoken by the (mainly Orthodox) Izhorians of Ingria. It has approximately 70 native speakers left, most of whom are elderly.

The Ingrian language should be distinguished from the Ingrian dialect of the Finnish language, which became the majority language of Ingria in the 17th century with the influx of Lutheran Finnish immigrants; their descendants, the Ingrian Finns, are often referred to as Ingrians. The immigration of Lutheran Finns was promoted by Swedish authorities, who gained the area in 1617 from Russia, as the local population was (and remained) Orthodox.

==Dialects==
Four dialects groups of Ingrian have been attested, two of which are probably extinct by now:
* Hevaha, spoken along Kovashi River and nearby coastal areas (†)
* Soikkola, spoken on Soikinsky Peninsula and along Sista River
* Ylä-Laukaa (Upper Luga or Oredezhi), spoken along Oredezh River and the upper Luga River (†)
* Ala-Laukaa (Lower Luga), a divergent dialect influenced by Votic
** The extinct Kukkuzi dialect of Votic is often considered a mixed language of Lower Luga Ingrian and Votic.
** Siberian Ingrian Finnish is a mixed language of Lower Luga Ingrian Finnish and Lower Luga Ingrian spoken near Omsk in Siberia.
A fifth dialect may have once been spoken on the Karelian Isthmus in northernmost Ingria, and may have been a substrate of local dialects of southeastern Finnish.

==History==

===Origin===

Ingrian is classified, together with Finnish, Karelian (including Livvi), Ludic and Veps, in the Northern Finnic branch of the Uralic languages.

The exact origin of Izhorians, and by extension the Ingrian language, is not fully clear. Most scholars agree that Ingrian is most closely related to the Karelian language and the Eastern dialects of Finnish, although the exact nature of this relationship is unclear:

A popular opinion holds that the split of the Karelian and Ingrian languages can be traced back to around the 8th-12th centuries A.D., with the Ingrian language originating from a Pre-Karelian group travelling westward along the Neva river.

===Pre-Soviet descriptions===
The first Ingrian records can be traced back to the &quot;Linguarum totius orbis vocabularia comparativa&quot; by Peter Simon Pallas, which contains a vocabulary of the so-called Chukhna language, which contains terms in Finnish, Votic and Ingrian.

Not much later, Fedor Tumansky, in a description of the Saint Petersburg Governorate adds vocabularies of various local languages, among which one he dubbed &quot;ямский&quot; (&quot;the language of Yamburg&quot;), corresponding to the modern Ala-Laukaa dialect of Ingrian.

During the Finnish national awakening in the end of the 19th century, as the collection of Finnic folk poetry became widespread, a large number of poems and songs were recorded in lands inhabited by Izhorians, as well, and ultimately published in various volumes of &quot;Suomen kansan vanhat runot&quot;. The songs, although originally sung in the Ingrian language, have been noted using Finnish grammar and Finnish phonology in many cases, as the collectors were not interested in the exact form of the original text.

One of the collectors of the Ingrian poems, , has gone on to write a first grammatical description of Ingrian, including sections on the Ingrian dialects of Finnish. This grammar includes a thorough analysis of the Soikkola, Hevaha, and Ala-Laukaa dialects, and includes a handful of texts (notably, fairy tales, including traditional versions of &quot;The Little Humpbacked Horse&quot; and &quot;Tsarevitch Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf&quot;) in all four dialects of Ingrian.

===Early Soviet period===

In 1925, Julius Mägiste wrote a second grammatical description of Ingrian, this time of the Finnic varieties spoken in a handful of villages along the , which showed both Ingrian and Finnish features. This variety was closely related to the modern Siberian Ingrian Finnish. Simultaneously, in the late 1920s, Ingrian-speaking selsovets started to form across the Ingrian-speaking territory.

In 1932, a total of 19 schools were opened where education was performed in Ingrian. A first primer in the Ingrian language was published, based on a subdialect of Soikkola Ingrian. The primer was the first of a series of schoolbooks written in this dialect. A number of features characteristic of the language in which these books were written included the vowel raising of mid vowels, and a lack of distinction between voiced, semivoiced and voiceless consonants.

By 1935, the number of Ingrian schools increased to 23 (18 primary schools and 5 secondary schools). At the same time, a systematic process of assimilation had begun.

In 1936, , one of the authors of the above mentioned books, wrote a grammar of the Ingrian language, in Ingrian. In the grammar, Junus introduced a literary language for Ingrian, which he based on the then most populous dialects: the Soikkola and Ala-Laukaa dialects. Junus&#x27; grammar included rules for spelling and inflection, as well as a general description of the spoken Ingrian language. The grammar introduced a new age of written Ingrian, and was soon followed by another wave of schoolbooks, written in the new literary variety of Ingrian.
The Ingrian schools stayed open until the mass repressions in 1937, during which Väinö Junus and many other teachers were executed, the schoolbooks were confiscated, and by 1938, the Ingrian selsovets were closed. Many Izhorians were sent to concentration camps or executed.

During the world war, many Izhorians fell in battle, and starved due to the famine the war brought. A large number of Izhorians was deported, among with Ingrian Finns and Votians to Finland in 1943-1944, as part of an agreement between Finland and Germany during the Continuation War. Almost all Izhorian families decided to return to the Soviet Union after the war ended. Upon return to the Soviet Union after the war, Izhorians were banned from settling their native lands, and were instead scattered across the nation.

Due to the many repressions, deportations and war, the number of Izhorians, as well as Ingrian speakers, decreased dramatically. The 1926 census counted over 16.000 Izhorians. In 1939 this number decreased to just over 7.000, and by 1959 just 369 people claimed to be native Ingrian speakers.

===Alphabet (1932)===

=== Alphabet (1936) ===

The order of the 1936 alphabet is similar to the Russian Cyrillic alphabet.

===Alphabet (2005–present)===
The order of the current alphabet matches the Finnish alphabet.

==Grammar==

Like other Uralic languages, Ingrian is a highly agglutinative language. Ingrian inflection is exclusively performed using inflectional suffixes, with prefixes being only used in derivation.

Ingrian nouns and adjectives are inflected for number (singular and plural) and case. Ingrian nominals distinguish between twelve cases, with a thirteenth (the comitative) only being present in nouns. Like Finnish, Ingrian has two cases used for the direct object: the nominative-genitive (used in telic constructions) and the partitive (used in atelic constructions). Ingrian adjectives often have a separate comparative form, but lack a morphologically distinct superlative.

Ingrian distinguishes between three persons. There is no distinction in gender, but there is an animacy distinction in interrogative pronouns.

Ingrian verbs feature four moods: indicative, conditional, imperative and the now rare potential. Verbs are inflected for three persons, two numbers and a special impersonal form for each of the moods, although the imperative lacks a first person form. The indicative has both present and past forms. Negation in Ingrian is expressed by means of a negative verb that inflects by person and has separate imperative forms.

==Phonology==

The phonology of the two extant Ingrian varieties differs substantially. The Soikkola dialect features a threefold contrast in consonant length ( vs vs ) as well as a threefold distinction in voicing ( vs vs ). The Ala-Laukaa dialect, on the contrary only has a twofold contrast in both length and voicing ( vs vs ), but features highly prominent vowel reduction, resulting in phonetically both reduced and voiceless vowels ( vs vs ).

Both dialects show various processes of consonant assimilation in voicing and, in the case of the nasal phoneme , place of articulation. The consonant inventory of the Ala-Laukaa dialect is relatively larger, as it includes a number of loaned phonemes not or only partially distinguished in the Soikkola dialect.

To the right, the consonant inventory of Ingrian is shown. The consonants highlighted in red are only found in the Ala-Laukaa dialect or as loaned phonemes, while consonants in green are only found in the Soikkola dialect. Both phonemes (slashes) and allophones (brackets) are shown.

Stress in Ingrian generally falls on the first syllable, with a secondary stress on every uneven nonfinal syllabe (third, fifth, etc.). An exception is the word &quot;paraikaa&quot; (&quot;now&quot;), which is stressed on the second syllable. Furthermore, some speakers might stress borrowed words according to the stress rules of the donor language.

==Morphophonology==
The Ingrian language has several morphophonological processes.

Vowel harmony is the process that the affixes attached to a lemma may change depending on the stressed vowel of the word. This means that if the word is stressed on a back vowel, the affix would contain a back vowel as well, while if the word&#x27;s stress lies on a front vowel, the affix would naturally contain a front vowel. Thus, if the stress of a word lies on an &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, the possible affix vowels would be &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, while if the stress of a word lies on an &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot; or &quot;y&quot;, the possible affix vowels to this word would then be &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot; or &quot;y&quot;:
: nappi (button, &quot;nominativa&quot;); nappi&quot;a&quot; (button, &quot;partitiva&quot;)
: näppi (pinch, &quot;nominativa&quot;); näppi&quot;ä&quot; (pinch, &quot;partitiva&quot;)
The vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are neutral, that is to say that they can be used together with both types of vowels.

==Vocabulary==
The words in the Ingrian language are mostly of native Finnic origin, and show great similarity with the surrounding Finnish and Estonian languages. Below is given a Leipzig-Jakarta list of the Ingrian language:

Nevertheless, borrowings from Russian, both old and new, are very common. Some borrowings from Finnish, Estonian and Votic are also present:

<doc id="704925" wikidata="Q738747" url="?curid=704925" title="Willy Wonka">
<text>Willy Wonka is a fictional character appearing in British author Roald Dahl&#x27;s 1964 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, its 1972 sequel &quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot; and several films based on those books. He is the eccentric founder and proprietor of the Wonka Chocolate Factory.

Wonka has been portrayed in film multiple times. In 1971, Willy Wonka was portrayed by Gene Wilder in &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;. Wilder&#x27;s portrayal in the film is considered widely beloved and one of his greatest roles. Johnny Depp&#x27;s portrayal of the character in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; polarized critics and audiences. In 2023, Timothée Chalamet portrayed the character in a standalone film that tells his origin story titled &quot;Wonka&quot;. Chalamet&#x27;s performance was both praised and criticized. Wilder, Depp, and Chalamet all received Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical for their performances.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;===
In &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, Wonka has hidden five Golden Tickets inside his chocolate bars. The finders are rewarded with a tour of his factory, each accompanied by an adult of their choice, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The children are unaware, though, that the tour is also a competition to test their moral character. As the tour proceeds, four of the children are eliminated, leaving Charlie Bucket the winner. At this point, Wonka reveals that the real prize is the factory itself, as he needs someone to take it over once he retires, and look after the Oompa-Loompas who work there.

Wonka is introduced as a &quot;little man&quot; with a goatee, wearing a purple coat, green trousers and a top hat. He is high-spirited and moves quickly like a squirrel, though he later tells Charlie that he is &quot;much older than you think.&quot;

===&quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;===
Wonka goes aboard the Great Glass Elevator with Charlie and his family and links up with the Space Hotel USA. The Space Hotel tracks the Elevator down back to Wonka&#x27;s factory. Wonka then goes with Charlie and his family to the White House in the United States.

===&quot;Wonka&quot;===
In 2023, Sibéal Pounder wrote a novelisation of the screenplay of &quot;Wonka&quot; as an origin story for the chocolatier.

==Film adaptations==
===&quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (1971)===
Willy Wonka (portrayed by Gene Wilder) has hidden five Golden Tickets amongst his famous Wonka Bars. The finders of these special tickets will be given a full tour of his tightly guarded candy factory, as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate. During the tour, Wonka tempts each of the bad children to disobey his orders with something related to their individual character flaws. One by one, each child disappears from the tour, until eventually Charlie Bucket is the only remaining child. However, Charlie and Grandpa Joe have also succumbed to temptation by this time and sampled Fizzy Lifting Drinks, Mr. Wonka&#x27;s experimental line of beverages that gives the drinker the power to float temporarily. The drinks, still too strong, brought Charlie and Grandpa Joe close to death.

Wonka informs Charlie that the tour is over, abruptly dismisses him and Grandpa Joe, and disappears into his office without mentioning the promised grand prize of a lifetime supply of chocolate. They both go into Wonka&#x27;s office to confront him. Grandpa Joe asks about the prize, but Wonka tells him that Charlie will not receive it because he broke the rules, angrily referring to the forfeiture clause of the contract that the ticket holders signed at the start of the tour. Charlie&#x27;s drinking of the Fizzy Lifting Drinks amounted to theft, so he violated the contract and gets nothing. Wonka then dismisses them with a furious, &quot;Good day, sir!&quot; Grandpa Joe angrily berates him for destroying his grandson&#x27;s hopes, but Wonka is unmoved and angrily dismisses him again.

Grandpa Joe vows to get revenge on Wonka by selling the Everlasting Gobstopper to Slugworth (Wonka&#x27;s main rival), but in honest acknowledgement of his wrongdoing, Charlie decides to return the Gobstopper to Wonka&#x27;s desk before turning to leave. Seeing how Charlie did not resort to revenge, Wonka sees an honest character in him and decides to let the fizzy lifting drink incident pass. He joyfully tells Charlie that he passed his test and reinstates his prize. Wonka then reveals that Slugworth, who had been spying on the kids, was actually his own employee in disguise.

The trio enter the Great Glass Elevator, which goes high into the sky as Wonka reveals that the grand prize is really the entire factory and business, which Charlie will get when Wonka retires, and in the meantime Charlie and his whole family will move into the factory. Wonka reminds Charlie not to forget what happened to the man who got everything that he ever wanted: &quot;He lived happily ever after.&quot;

===&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005)===
Willy Wonka (portrayed by Johnny Depp as an adult and by Blair Dunlop in his youth) is once again the owner of a famous chocolate factory. Due to problems concerning industrial espionage, he has laid off all his employees, among them Charlie&#x27;s Grandpa Joe, and closed his factory for many years. Wonka announces a contest in which five Golden Tickets have been hidden under the wrappers of Wonka Bars throughout the world. The finders will each receive a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate; in addition, one winner will receive a special prize at the end of the tour. Charlie is the last to find a Golden Ticket.

On the day of the tour, Wonka greets the winners and the adults accompanying them at the factory gates and leads them through the compound. Grandpa Joe, who accompanies Charlie, introduces himself to Wonka as a former employee, but Wonka is still suspicious of him. One by one, all of the children except Charlie succumb to temptations offered by Wonka and are removed from the tour. Wonka offers Charlie a chance to live and work with him in the factory, explaining that he is getting old, and that the purpose of the contest was to find a successor to take over as owner once he retires. However, Wonka expects Charlie to leave his family behind forever, seeing family as a hindrance to a chocolatier&#x27;s creative freedom.

Wonka&#x27;s position stems from a complicated relationship with his father, Wilbur, a prominent dentist, in which Wilbur forbade him to eat any candy and made him wear a large, cumbersome set of uncomfortable braces in order to keep his teeth in good condition. Wonka secretly sampled some candy one day and was instantly enthralled, running away from home and travelling to Switzerland and Bavaria in order to pursue a career in making it. When he returned home, he found that Wilbur had moved the entire house to an unknown location, true to his word that if Willy ran away, Wilbur would not be there when he came back.

Charlie, who is not prepared to part with his family, rejects the offer, prompting Wonka to fall into a deep depression that saps his creativity and causes his business to suffer. With Charlie&#x27;s help, Wonka locates Wilbur. As Wilbur checks Wonka&#x27;s teeth, from which he recognises his son, Charlie finds that Wilbur is genuinely proud of his son, having saved every news clipping of Wonka&#x27;s success. The two reconcile, and Wonka invites the entire Bucket family to live in the factory.

===&quot;Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2017)===

In 2017, a direct-to-DVD animated film featuring Tom and Jerry in an adaptation of the 1971 film was released. The main storyline is largely taken verbatim from the 1971 film, and thus Wonka (voiced by J. P. Karliak) is portrayed largely the same as in that adaptation. During the tour, Wonka becomes suspicious that one of the guests has smuggled a cat into the factory after seeing bits of fur left by Tom, who along with Jerry had previously been adopted by Charlie, and snuck into the factory in an attempt to stop what they believe to be Slugworth plotting to steal it from Wonka.

Wonka eventually notices Tom and Jerry&#x27;s presence, and accuses Charlie of smuggling them into the factory (along with his theft of the Fizzy Lifting Drinks) in order to justify denying him the lifetime&#x27;s supply of chocolate, though this also turns out to be part of the same test that Charlie was put through. Additionally, this version confirms that Wonka and &quot;Slugworth&quot; had intended from the very start to make Charlie the next owner of the factory, something that is left ambiguous by the other versions of the story.

===&quot;Wonka&quot; (2023)===
In the 2023 film &quot;Wonka&quot;, he is portrayed by Timothée Chalamet. The film tells a standalone origin story of the character about his early days as a chocolatier. In this version, a new backstory was added which reveals his even more troubled upbringing: Willy Wonka&#x27;s mother (who made chocolate bars) had died and the young Wonka traveled to Europe to open his own chocolate shop. At the end of the film, after exposing the crimes of the local Chocolate Cartel, Wonka opens the last chocolate bar his mother left him, which is revealed to contain a golden paper with a message telling him that chocolate is best shared with others. He and Lofty, an Oompa Loompa, would then acquire an abandoned castle to commence building a new factory.

==Musical adaptations==
===&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2013)===

In 2013, an adaptation of the novel was produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the West End starting on 25 June 2013. Willy Wonka in this production was originated by Douglas Hodge. In the play, Wonka decides to open his factory to five children who can find one of five Golden Tickets hidden in the wrappers of Wonka Bars. The play begins with Charlie in a large trash pile looking for items that are &quot;almost nearly perfect&quot;. He later goes home and we see the Golden Ticket winners on an oversized television with actors inside it. Once all the tickets have been won, Willy Wonka invites the children into his factory, where he then tempts each of them with a weakness. Finally, only Charlie is left. Willy Wonka and Charlie board Wonka&#x27;s &quot;Great Glass Elevator&quot;, which takes off over the audience.

===&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2017)===
A reworked version of the musical, featuring added songs from the 1971 film adaptation, premiered on Broadway in 2017. Wonka was portrayed this time by Christian Borle. While the Broadway version received mixed to negative reviews, Borle&#x27;s performance was praised. A U.S. tour commenced in 2018, with Noah Weisberg playing Wonka, and the musical premiered in Australia in 2019.

==Film characters==
===2005 film adaptation===

Early on in the production of the 2005 film, Nicolas Cage was under discussions for portraying Willy Wonka, but lost interest. Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn wanted Tom Shadyac to direct Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka, believing the duo could make &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; relevant to mainstream audiences, but Roald Dahl&#x27;s widow Liccy Dahl opposed this. After Tim Burton was hired as director in May 2003, Burton immediately thought of Johnny Depp for the role of Willy Wonka, who joined the following August for his fourth collaboration with the director.

Burton and screenwriter John August worked together in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy&#x27;s domineering dentist father. &quot;You want a little bit of the flavor of why Wonka is the way he is,&quot; Burton reasoned. &quot;Otherwise, what is he? He&#x27;s just a weird guy.&quot; Warner Bros. and Burton held differences over the characterization of Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie Bucket had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would not be a good father, finding the character similar to a recluse. &quot;In some ways,&quot; Burton protested, &quot;he&#x27;s more screwed up than the kids.&quot;

Johnny Depp was the only actor that Burton had considered for the role. He signed on without reading the script, under the intention of going with a completely different approach than what Gene Wilder did in the 1971 film adaptation. &quot;Regardless of what one thinks of that film,&quot; Depp explained, &quot;Gene Wilder&#x27;s persona, his character, stands out.&quot; Depp stated on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; that he based the character on what he believed an &quot;incredibly stoned&quot; George W. Bush would act like.

Comparisons were drawn between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson, due to Wonka&#x27;s more childish demeanour. Burton joked, &quot;Here&#x27;s the deal. There&#x27;s a big difference: Michael Jackson &quot;likes&quot; children, Willy Wonka &quot;can&#x27;t stand them&quot;. To me that&#x27;s a &quot;huge&quot; difference in the whole persona thing.&quot; Depp explained that the similarities with Jackson never even occurred to him. &quot;I say if there was anyone you&#x27;d want to compare Wonka to it would be a Howard Hughes, almost. Reclusive, germaphobe, controlling.&quot; Burton agreed with the Hughes similarities, and additionally supplied Charles Foster Kane in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as inspiration. &quot;Somebody who was brilliant but then was traumatized and then retreats into their own world.&quot; Depp wanted to sport prosthetic makeup for the part and have a long, elongated nose, but Burton believed that it would be too outrageous.

==Critical analysis==
===Gene Wilder&#x27;s performance===
Wilder&#x27;s performance as Willy Wonka was well received and remains one of his best-known roles. &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; called it &quot;Great fun, with Wilder for once giving an impeccably controlled performance as the factory&#x27;s bizarre candy owner.&quot; Critic Jeffrey M. Anderson, of Combustible Celluloid, wrote, &quot;[W]hen the movie does actually reach the factory, and Gene Wilder takes the stage, the movie is saved. Wilder was in the middle of an incredible run of subtle comic performances ... and he was at the height of his powers here.&quot; Wilder himself considered the role to be one of his signature roles, with his next of kin noting that he purposely kept his diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease private because so many young children would recognize him on the street as Wonka and he wanted those encounters to be joyful experiences.

Regarding Wilder&#x27;s effect, Anderson wrote &quot;If you&#x27;re a kid, Wonka seems magical, but watching it now, he has a frightening combination of warmth, psychosis, and sadism.&quot; Kevin Carr, of 7M pictures wrote &quot;This is Gene Wilder&#x27;s legacy. He was perfect for the role, and it was his mixture of childlike wonder and bitter, deserved vengeance that made the character so compelling.&quot;, while critic Widgett Walls simply called it &quot;Probably Gene Wilder&#x27;s finest, most manic hour.&quot; Wilder received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for his role as Willy Wonka, but lost to Chaim Topol as Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

===Johnny Depp&#x27;s performance===
Johnny Depp&#x27;s portrayal of Willy Wonka polarized critics and audiences. Critic Andrew Sarris, of &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Observer&quot;, who did not enjoy the film&#x27;s style in general, wrote &quot;I wonder if even children will respond to the peculiarly humorless and charmless stylistic eccentricities of Mr. Burton and his star, Johnny Depp.&quot; Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also criticized Depp&#x27;s acting; &quot;The cumulative effect isn&#x27;t pretty. Nor is it kooky, funny, eccentric or even mildly interesting. Indeed, throughout his fey, simpering performance, Depp seems to be straining so hard for weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip.&quot; Roger Ebert wrote &quot;Depp, an actor of considerable gifts, has never been afraid to take a chance, but this time he takes the wrong one. His Willy Wonka is an enigma in an otherwise mostly delightful movie from Tim Burton.&quot;

Positive reactions to Depp&#x27;s performance include Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, who wrote that &quot;Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka may be a stone freak, but he is also one of Burton&#x27;s classic crackpot conjurers, like &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; or &quot;Ed Wood&quot;.&quot; Mick LaSalle from the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; found that &quot;all the laughs [in the film] come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva&quot;. Peter Travers wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that &quot;Depp&#x27;s deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka&#x27;s secret heart than what Gene Wilder did.&quot; Depp received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for his role as Willy Wonka, but lost to Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in &quot;Walk the Line&quot;.

===Timothée Chalamet&#x27;s performance===
Chalamet&#x27;s take on the character received mixed reviews. David Fear of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; likened Chalamet to a &quot;void&quot;: &quot;You wish that Chalamet was bringing something, anything, to what too often feels like character karaoke. He’s not bad, just blank.&quot; Alison Willmore of &quot;Vulture&quot; cited Chalamet&#x27;s performance as the weakest part of &quot;Wonka&quot;, &quot;which isn’t to say that he’s bad in the movie – just hesitant, like he’s working in an idiom that doesn’t come naturally to him, which is odd.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Chalamet&#x27;s performance &quot;one-dimensional&quot; and criticized him as &quot;a character so purely benevolent and selfless that he makes Jesus, Gandhi and the Buddha look like a bunch of hooligans.&quot;

Courtney Howard of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised Chalamet&#x27;s performance: &quot;His magical emcee isn’t too far off from Gene Wilder’s as glimpsed in his physicality and vocal intonations, but his performance has its own unique sway and ease.&quot; Kristy Puchko of Mashable called Chalamet &quot;marvelous&quot; as Wonka: &quot;He is positively lovely, like he&#x27;s got some bottled sunshine of his own... Giddy and genuine, Chalamet is a prince of musical theater, whether dancing with a rousing ensemble or waltzing with a hat and coat on a walking stick as a stand-in partner.&quot; Katie Walsh of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; offered similar praise: &quot;[He] gives himself over fully to the wonderment and vocal demands of the role.&quot;

Chalamet received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for the role but lost to Paul Giamatti for &quot;The Holdovers&quot;.

==Merchandising==
Wonka served as the mascot of &quot;The Willy Wonka Candy Company&quot;, a real-life brand of confectioneries marketed by Nestlé Candy Shop. Real-life versions of the Everlasting Gobstopper and the Wonka Bar were produced, along with a line of other candies not directly related to the book or the film. The company had originated as a tie-in with the 1971 film, originally by Quaker Oats before a series of sales led to the company being acquired by Nestlé in 1988. The Wonka brand was discontinued in 2015; its products have since been sold to Ferrero, which produces them under the Ferrara brand.

<text>Longueuil—Saint-Hubert (formerly Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher and Longueuil) is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, represented in the House of Commons of Canada from since 2015 

==Geography==
This South Shore district in the Quebec region of Montérégie includes the eastern part of the City of Longueuil.

The neighbouring ridings are Longueuil—Charles-LeMoyne, Montarville, Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères, La Pointe-de-l&#x27;Île, and Hochelaga.

==Profile==
This mainly Francophone riding is one of the NDP&#x27;s safer seats on the South Shore. The NDP did well across the district, with the BQ coming in distant second for the most part. The Liberals and Conservatives did poorly in this riding, although the Liberals had a tiny pocket of somewhat strong support around Parc Michel-Chartrand. Despite winning the riding again in 2015, it was an extremely close contest. The Liberals surged into second place, just one point away from defeating the incumbent NDP candidate.

==Demographics==
:&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census&quot;
* Twenty most common mother tongue languages (2016) : 83.5% French, 3.5% English, 3.1% Spanish, 2.1% Arabic, 1.0% Creole languages, 0.7% Romanian, 0.6% Farsi, 0.5% Portuguese, 0.5% Italian, 0.5% Russian, 0.5% Vietnamese, 0.4% Mandarin, 0.3% Kabyle, 0.2% Cantonese, 0.2% Greek, 0.1% Polish, 0.1% Ukrainian, 0.1% Bulgarian, 0.1% German, 0.1% Lao, 0.1% Wolof

==History==
The electoral district was created as &quot;Longueuil&quot; in 1952 from parts of Chambly—Rouville and Châteauguay—Huntingdon—Laprairie ridings. It was renamed &quot;Longueuil—Pierre-Boucher&quot; in 2004.

This riding was largely replaced with &quot;Longueuil—Saint-Hubert&quot;, losing territory to Pierre-Boucher—Les Patriotes—Verchères and gaining territory from Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

===Members of Parliament===
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<doc id="704933" wikidata="Q145464" url="?curid=704933" title="Lorenzo Lamas">
<text>Lorenzo Fernando Lamas (born January 20, 1958) is an American actor and producer. He is widely known for his role of Lance Cumson, the irresponsible grandson of Angela Channing—played by Jane Wyman—in the soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1981–1990), for which he received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.

Lamas is also known for his roles as Reno Raines in the crime drama series &quot;Renegade&quot; (1992–1997), Dr. Hollywood on the Nickelodeon TV show &quot;Big Time Rush&quot; (2009-2013), Hector Ramirez in the soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (2004–2006), and Meap on the television show &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;. He served as a judge on ABC television&#x27;s &quot;Are You Hot?&quot;, and starred in his own reality show, &quot;Leave It to Lamas&quot;, a series about his real-life family.

As an executive producer, he worked on such films as &quot;Night of the Warrior&quot; (1990, starring himself, his wife Kathleen Kinmont, and his mother Arlene Dahl), &quot;Ulterior Motives&quot; (1990, starring Thomas Ian Griffith, Marry Page Keller, and Ken Howard), and &quot;Mom and Dad Save the World&quot; (1991, starring Teri Garr, Jeffrey Jones, and Jon Lovitz).

==Early life==
Lamas was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Argentine actor Fernando Lamas and Norwegian American actress Arlene Dahl. He is the stepson of swimmer and film star Esther Williams, who married his father when Lamas was 11 years old. Both Williams and Dahl were best friends of actress Jane Wyman (who knew him from birth), and would later work alongside Lamas on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. He was brought up in Pacific Palisades, California, and moved to New York City in 1971. In 1979, he took up Taekwondo, earning a third-degree black belt, also Shotokan Karate, Ju jitsu and Aikido, earning black belts in each. He graduated from the Admiral Farragut Academy in Pine Beach, New Jersey, in 1975.

==Career==
===Early career===
Lamas had longed to be in show business since the age of five, when he approached his mother and said, &quot;I want to be a star...I mean, an actor.&quot; With a smile, she replied, &quot;I heard you the first time, son.&quot;

Lamas first studied acting in Tony Barr&#x27;s Film Actors Workshop and quickly thereafter obtained his first TV acting role in 1976. As a last-minute replacement for Steven Ford, Lamas secured a non-speaking role as a jock in the 1978 musical film &quot;Grease&quot;, in which he dyed his hair blond. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lamas had guest-starring roles in a number of TV series including &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;Sword of Justice&quot;, &quot;Dear Detective&quot;, &quot;Secrets of Midland Heights&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Hotel&quot;.

===&quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1981–1990)===
In 1980, Lamas auditioned for and won the role of Lance Cumson, for the pilot of a new series entitled &quot;The Vintage Years&quot;. The pilot was later retooled to become the hit prime time drama series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, which aired on CBS for nine seasons from December 4, 1981, to May 17, 1990. During a 2006 TV interview with a Norwegian television team, Lamas said that to get the role he had auditioned twice and beat out five other actors for the part. Lamas was nominated for a Golden Globe and two Soap Opera Digest Awards for his work on the series; he was the only actor to appear in all 227 episodes.

During his tenure on the show, Lamas had the lead role in the poorly received film &quot;Body Rock&quot; (1984), where he was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor. He also performed a song on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, and the track &quot;Fools Like Me&quot; became his only single to date to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at #85. The co-founder of the Golden Raspberry Awards, John J.B. Wilson, later named &quot;Body Rock&quot; as one of &quot;The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made&quot;.

===Later career===
Lamas began carving out a niche for himself as an action-hero, showcasing his martial-arts skills by starring in such movies as the &quot;Snake Eater&quot; trilogy (1989–1992), &quot;Bounty Tracker&quot; (1993), &quot;Gladiator Cop&quot; (1995), &quot;Terminal Justice&quot; (1996), and many similar low-budget action-films. From 1992 to 1997, Lamas played the lead role of Reno Raines (a falsely accused cop) in the syndicated series &quot;Renegade&quot;, which allowed him to exercise his enthusiasm for Harley-Davidson motorcycles as well as martial arts. The show was seen in over 100 countries, and during its fifth and final season, it moved from first-run syndication to the USA Network. Lamas had been keeping his hair long (past his shoulders) during this time, so when he had it cut short following the end of the fourth season of &quot;Renegade&quot;, he had to wear a long-haired wig for filming of the final season. In 2004, Lamas joined the soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; as Hector Ramirez, remaining on the show until 2006.

In August 2007, Lamas starred as the King of Siam in &quot;The King and I&quot; at the Ogunquit Playhouse in Ogunquit, Maine. That fall, he performed at Kean University Premiere Stages in Union, New Jersey, in the title role in Steven Dietz&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;. In June 2008, he performed as El Gallo in &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; at the Casa Mañana Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas. In June 2009, Lamas returned to the Ogunquit Playhouse as Zach in &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. 

In 2015, Lamas was a cast member of the reality TV series &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;.

As of 2016, Lamas was working as a helicopter pilot, flying people on day trips to the Grand Canyon from Los Angeles. According to his Twitter account, he is currently flying as a helicopter tour pilot with HeliNY in New York City.

==Personal life==
Lamas has been married six times and has six children. His first marriage was to Victoria Hilbert (1981–1982). His second marriage (1983–1985) was to his publicist, Michele Cathy Smith, with whom he had two children: son Alvaro Joshua &quot;A.J.&quot; (b. 1983) and daughter Shayne (b. 1985), both actors. Lamas was then in a relationship with actress Daphne Ashbrook; the couple had a daughter.

Lamas was married to his third wife, &quot;Renegade&quot; co-star Kathleen Kinmont, from 1989 to 1993. Playmate of the Month Shauna Sand (who made guest appearances in &quot;Renegade&quot;) became Lamas&#x27; fourth wife in 1996. The couple had three daughters before divorcing in 2002.

After five months of dating, Lamas married his fifth wife, Shawna Craig, 2011 in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. He told reporters that he would change his name to Lorenzo Lamas-Craig. This decision was motivated by the fact that his previous wife, Shauna, kept the surname Lamas, and is legally named Shauna Lamas, and new bride Shawna, whose given name is a homonym and almost identical to that of Shauna, did not wish to have a virtually identical full name. In June 2018, Lamas filed for divorce from his fifth wife citing irreconcilable differences.

Lamas started dating Kenna Scott in April 2020. The couple got engaged in Las Vegas in February 2021. The wedding was on October 29, 2023, at the Wonderland on the cruise ship &quot;Wonder of the Seas&quot;.

Lamas enjoyed close friendships with his &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; co-stars Ana Alicia and Jane Wyman. He continually praised
Wyman&#x27;s professionalism and credited her as a &quot;huge influence&quot; on his life and career. After Wyman&#x27;s death in 2007, Lamas released a statement: &quot;Next to my parents, Jane was the most influential person in my young career. She has left an incredible body of work and accomplishments that cannot go without being recognized and celebrated. I will miss her greatly.&quot;

Lamas&#x27; stepmother, Esther Williams, died on June 6, 2013, at the age of 91, in Los Angeles, California. He stated on Twitter: &quot;The best swim teacher and soul mom RIP.&quot;

Lamas published his autobiography, &quot;Renegade at Heart&quot; (co-written by celebrity biographer Jeff Lenburg) in December 2014.

<text>Orange Sky Golden Harvest (OSGH) (), previously known as Golden Harvest () from 1970 to 2009, is a film production, distribution, and exhibition company based in Hong Kong. It dominated Hong Kong cinema box office sales from the 1970s to the 1980s, and played a major role in introducing Hong Kong action films to the world, especially those by Bruce Lee (Concord Production Inc.), Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Sammo Hung.

==History==
Notable names in the company include its founders, the veteran film producers Raymond Chow, Peter Choy, and Leonard Ho. Chow, Ho and Choy were executives with Hong Kong&#x27;s top studio Shaw Brothers but left in 1970 to form their own studio. They succeeded by taking a different approach from the highly centralised Shaw model. Golden Harvest contracted with independent producers and gave talent more generous pay and greater creative freedom. Some filmmakers and actors from Shaw Brothers defected. But what really put the company on the map was a 1971 deal with soon-to-be martial arts superstar Bruce Lee with the film &quot;The Big Boss&quot;, after he had turned down the low-paying standard contract offered him by the Shaws. Golden Harvest&#x27;s films with Lee were the first Hong Kong films to reach a large worldwide audience.

In 1973, Golden Harvest entered into a pioneering co-production with Hollywood for the English-language Bruce Lee film, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (), a worldwide hit made with the Warner Bros. studio and Concord Production Inc.

Following Lee&#x27;s death, Golden Harvest found success with the Hui Brothers&#x27; comedies such as &quot;Games Gamblers Play&quot; (1974), &quot;The Last Message&quot; (1975), &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; (1976), &quot;The Contract&quot; (1978) and &quot;Security Unlimited&quot; (1981). The studio supplanted Shaw Brothers as Hong Kong&#x27;s dominant studio by the end of the 1970s and retained that position into the 1990s. 

Golden Harvest developed a worldwide film distribution operation and started producing films for an international market and had released eight by 1980, including &quot;The Amsterdam Kill&quot; (1978) starring Robert Mitchum and &quot;The Boys in Company C&quot; (1978) directed by Sidney J. Furie. It also released Jackie Chan&#x27;s first film for the international market, &quot;The Big Brawl&quot; (1980), although it did not match the success of &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. In 1981, &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; was a big hit. The studio also made Tom Selleck&#x27;s first two films with him in a starring role, &quot;High Road to China&quot; (1983) and &quot;Lassiter&quot; (1984). Following the disappointing performance of these and others, Golden Harvest quietly withdrew from the US market.

From the 1980s until very recently, the studio produced almost all of the films of Jackie Chan, the studio&#x27;s greatest asset for years. Golden Harvest has also produced a number of films with Jet Li, Cynthia Rothrock and Donnie Yen. 

Starting in 1990, Golden Harvest had a big international success again with the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; trilogy. Allegedly, the company once attempted to produce a &quot;Daimajin&quot; film by starring Kevin Costner. 

In 1992, Golden Village, a 50:50 joint venture between Golden Harvest and Village Roadshow of Australia was set up to develop and operate modern, multiplex cinemas in Singapore. In 1993, Golden Harvest sold its film library to Star TV.

Golden Harvest was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1994.

Golden Harvest&#x27;s activity has declined since the death of Leonard Ho in 1998. In 2003, they withdrew from film-making to concentrate on film financing, distribution, and cinema management in Hong Kong and in Mainland China.

In 2004, Li Ka-shing and EMI became shareholders of the company. In 2007, Raymond Chow sold the company to Chinese businessman Wu Kebo, who owns the China-based Orange Sky Entertainment Group. In early 2009, Golden Harvest merged with Orange Sky and was renamed Orange Sky Golden Harvest (). From 2009 to 2011 it was operated by Kelvin Wu King Shiu who become the CEO of the company. At that time Golden Harvest announced their relaunch and previewed a new trailer set for movies in 2010.

In October 2017, Golden Harvest acquired the other 50% stake of Golden Village from its joint venture partner, Village Roadshow, and therefore having full ownership of Golden Village. This was after a prior bid by Singapore-based media mini-conglomerate MM2 Asia to acquire the Village Roadshow stake in June 2017, as Village Roadshow failed to secure the approval of Golden Harvest. It is unknown whether the Village name will be dropped from Golden Village as a result of the acquisition.

==Cinemas==

Orange Sky Golden Harvest has cinemas not only in Hong Kong, but also in Mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore. Most of these are joint ventures. Golden Village, now fully owned by Orange Sky Golden Harvest, was a former joint venture with Village Roadshow responsible for the operation of Gold Class cinemas and Asia&#x27;s first multiplex.

In Malaysia, the group was instrumental in the formation of the country&#x27;s two largest cinema chains: Golden Screen Cinemas, a joint venture with Malaysia&#x27;s PPB Group who bought out Golden Harvest&#x27;s stake for full ownership, and TGV Cinemas (formerly Tanjong Golden Village), a joint venture with Tanjong of Malaysia and Village Roadshow of Australia, the former having bought out the remaining stakes for full ownership.

The company has recently acquired Warner Village in Taiwan.

<text>The KROQ Top 106.7 Countdowns is an end-of-year countdown that lists the top &quot;106.7&quot; songs on the Los Angeles station KROQ as voted by listeners. The countdown started in 1980, and ran every year until 2009. Since 2009, the list has been compiled by fans from playlist data.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, KROQ&#x27;s proximity to Hollywood and the Los Angeles music scene gave it a unique place in the development of the punk, new wave and alternative rock genres. In its heyday, KROQ was considered the most powerful radio station in the world. It was the top-rated station in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, and its &quot;ROQ of the 80s&quot; format was copied nationwide. Its renegade roots, and willingness to experiment, came along at the same time as the birth of punk and new wave. The choices made by the station and its staff had a worldwide impact. This is reflected in the annual list of most popular songs.

The end of year countdown was the first among the station&#x27;s &quot;lists&quot;. Among others released are the &quot;List Of 106.7 Biggest KROQ Bands&quot; and &quot;Flashback 500&quot; or &quot;Firecracker 500&quot; (presenting the 500 most popular songs). In April 2020, the station released a COVID Quarantine edition of the &quot;Top 106.7 Songs of All Time&quot;, with Everlong by the Foo Fighters topping the list.

==Countdowns by year==
==Lack of female artist representation==

Over the years, bands like the Go-Gos and the Bangles made the list, but didn&#x27;t make the top spot. Missing Persons, fronted by Dale Bozzio, topped the chart in 1981, the chart&#x27;s second year. However, since its inception, the number of female artists has decreased over the years, with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor being the only woman, or female act, to top the countdown. This is the same phenomena seen on the Billboard&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart that went seventeen years without a woman topping the chart from 1996 to 2013.

Over the years, KROQ&#x27;s Weenie Roast has also faced allegations that it does not pay enough attention to gender equity.

<doc id="704953" wikidata="Q7923378" url="?curid=704953" title="Vesta Victoria">
<text>Vesta Victoria (born Victoria Lawrence, 26 November 1873 – 7 April 1951) was an English music hall singer and comedian. She was famous for her performances of songs such as &quot;Waiting at the Church&quot; and &quot;Daddy Wouldn&#x27;t Buy Me a Bow Wow&quot;, both of which were written specially for her. Vesta&#x27;s comic laments delivered in deadpan style were even more popular in the USA: she was, at the beginning of the twentieth century, one of the most successful British entertainers in America.

==Life and career==
Vesta Victoria was born Victoria Lawrence at 8 Ebenezer Place in Holbeck, Leeds, on 26 November 1873. Her parents, Joe and Emma (née Thompson), were themselves entertainers, and she made her stage debut aged six weeks in one of her father&#x27;s sketches.

Billed as &quot;Baby Victoria&quot; until nearly ten years of age, she was &quot;Little Victoria&quot; by her first London appearance in 1883.
The painter Walter Sickert (1860–1942) made a portrait of her performing – &quot;Vesta Victoria at the Old Bedford&quot; – in about 1890.
Though Yorkshire-born, Vesta assumed a Cockney stage persona. Her singing career escalated in 1892 when &quot;Daddy Wouldn&#x27;t Buy Me a Bow Wow&quot; became a huge hit. She sang it first at South London Palace, a music hall in Lambeth, and to high success on her first trip to the United States in 1892, when she appeared for eight weeks at Tony Pastor&#x27;s theatre in New York City.

Vesta married twice, both marriages producing a daughter. She was married to music hall manager Frederick Wallace McAvoy from 1894 to 1904. They had a daughter, Irene. The marriage ended in divorce, because McAvoy was a cruel, abusive and adulterous husband. In 1912, Vesta announced in New York that she was married to William Terry. In 1913, the couple had a daughter, Iris. But the 1912 &quot;marriage&quot; may have been invented, as English records show that Vesta and William Terry were married in Wandsworth in 1920. In any event, the marriage ended in 1926, when Vesta filed for divorce on the grounds of &quot;Ill-usage and association with other women&quot;.

One of the most highly paid vaudeville stars, Vesta bought a considerable amount of property in America. By the 1920s, she is estimated to have been worth around £3.25 million – the equivalent in 2014 of around £975 million. She retired after World War I, but re-recorded many of her hits in 1931 in a series of Old-Time Medleys, and performed at the Royal Variety Show of 1932. She also appeared in a number of films in the 1930s. Unlike younger music hall contemporaries Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel, Victoria remained principally a live performer in England instead of becoming a full-time film performer in the USA; next to nothing remains of what film work she did.

Vesta died of breast cancer in Hampstead, north London, on 7 April 1951. She did not leave a will, and at probate her estate was valued at £15,631.17s. 5d. The large fortune she amassed by the 1920s is thought to have been lost in the interim partly to the scheming of handsome young men, and partly as a result of the news-making robbery of her famous jewellery collection.

She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, where a lilac tree (no longer in existence) was planted in her memory.

==Legacy==
Dr Carol Morley argues that Vesta&#x27;s characterisations of downtrodden women laughing off problems were, in their time, an influence on the development of the emerging musical form of the blues.

By 1906, Vesta&#x27;s fame in America was then such that one of San Francisco&#x27;s main roads was renamed &quot;Vesta Victoria Avenue&quot; in her honour; the city was grateful that she performed numerous benefit concerts for the relief of sufferers in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Actress Helen Fraser toured her one-woman show &quot;Vesta&quot;, based on Vesta Victoria&#x27;s life and work, in the 1990s, playing over 90 performances in the UK and across America.

<doc id="704958" wikidata="Q1358683" url="?curid=704958" title="Wilson Phillips">
<text>Wilson Phillips is an American pop vocal group formed in Los Angeles in 1989. The group consists of sisters Carnie and Wendy Wilson, the daughters of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, and Chynna Phillips, the daughter of John and Michelle Phillips of The Mamas &amp; The Papas.

Their 1990 eponymous debut album sold over 10 million copies worldwide and included five major US hit singles, four of which cracked the Top 10, with three peaking at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The group has been nominated for five Grammy Awards including Best New Artist, Album of the Year for &quot;Wilson Phillips&quot;, and Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Hold On&quot; at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards, as well as Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;You&#x27;re in Love&quot; at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards. The group has also been nominated for two American Music Awards, and in 1990, won the Billboard Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year for &quot;Hold On&quot;.

==History==
===1989–1991: Formation and &quot;Wilson Phillips&quot;===
The Wilson sisters and Phillips grew up together in the Los Angeles area in the 1970s and 80s. The three shared a love of music, and developed their singing and vocal harmonies. In 1989, the trio landed a deal with SBK Records.
All three are the offspring of prominent musicians; Chynna is the daughter of John and Michelle Phillips of the Mamas &amp; the Papas, and Carnie and Wendy are the daughters of Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and Marilyn Rovell of the Honeys. Wilson Phillips released their debut album, &quot;Wilson Phillips&quot;, in 1990. Their debut single, &quot;Hold On,&quot; hit number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on June 9, 1990. The single was also number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary and became a hit in several other countries; peaking at number two in Australia, number six in the UK, number seven in Ireland, number 10 in Sweden, and number 15 in the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. The single also won Wilson Phillips the Billboard Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year for 1990. The second single, &quot;Release Me&quot;, spent two weeks at number one. Their third single, &quot;Impulsive, became another top ten hit, peaking at number four on the Hot 100, while fourth single &quot;You&#x27;re in Love&quot; hit number one in the US for one week. The fifth single, &quot;The Dream Is Still Alive&quot;, peaked at number twelve on the Hot 100.

In 1991, the group contributed a version of the song &quot;Daniel&quot; to the tribute album &quot;Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John &amp; Bernie Taupin&quot;. While not released as a single, it peaked at number seven on the US Adult Contemporary chart due to strong airplay. Their single &quot;You&#x27;re in Love&quot; was released that same year, which scored as a number one (and to date, their last top ten) pop single. In 1992, Wilson Phillips also made history as &quot;Billboard&quot; declared their debut album, at that time, the best-selling album of all time by an all female act; the album peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, while it had sales of 5 million copies in the US, with a total of 8 million copies sold worldwide. That achievement, however, was later surpassed with the 1996 album &quot;Spice&quot; by the Spice Girls.

===1992–1993: &quot;Shadows and Light&quot; and breakup===
In June 1992, Wilson Phillips released their second album, &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;. The album was deeply personal and adopted a more serious tone, with tracks exploring issues such as child abuse (&quot;Where Are You&quot;) and their estrangement from their fathers (&quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, &quot;All the Way From New York&quot;). The first single, &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me Cry,&quot; peaked at number 20 in the US and number 18 in the UK, the first time they had a higher-ranking single in the UK than in the US. The single gave them a hit in the US and the UK, and saw the album peak at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it was eventually certified platinum in the US. However, the second single &quot;Give It Up&quot; became a moderate hit, peaking at number thirty, and third single &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; failed to crack the Hot 100. Shortly after, the group decided to break up, parting just after their second album. Chynna Phillips announced plans for a solo career, however, the group performed the US national anthem in a baseball stadium.

Less than a year after the release of their second album, the group had gone their separate ways. In 1993, Wendy and Carnie Wilson released the Christmas album &quot;Hey Santa!&quot;, a collection of classic Christmas songs which included an original song, &quot;Hey Santa&quot;. In 1995, Chynna Phillips released a solo album, &quot;Naked and Sacred&quot;. Also in 1995, Carnie went on to host her own short-lived syndicated television talk show titled &quot;Carnie!&quot; In 1997, Carnie and Wendy, along with their father Brian Wilson, released the album &quot;The Wilsons&quot; and the single &quot;Monday Without You.&quot; Capitol Records released a Wilson Phillips &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in 2000.

On March 29, 2001, the group reunited to perform The Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;You&#x27;re So Good to Me&quot; at a tribute show to Brian Wilson held at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall. Chynna Phillips also dedicated the performance to her father John Phillips, who had died a few days earlier.

===2004: First reunion===
Wilson Phillips reunited in 2004 to release a new album, &quot;California&quot;, a collection of cover songs. A single, &quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; a song originally recorded by Fleetwood Mac, peaked at number 13 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. The album fared moderately well on the charts, debuting and peaking at number 35 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart with 31,000 copies sold in its first week of release. In New Zealand, the album reached the top 10 and amassed gold status after &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; topped the country&#x27;s adult contemporary radio chart. The group parted ways once again.

===2010–present: Second reunion===
On October 12, 2010, Wilson Phillips released a Christmas album, &quot;Christmas in Harmony&quot;. The album yielded a single, &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday,&quot; a cover of the popular seasonal tune that first was a hit in 1973 for English glam-rock band Wizzard. The group had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; (2011) and performed &quot;Hold On&quot;. Bandmember Chynna was a contestant on season 13 of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot; and explained that &quot;Hold On&quot; was written by herself, Carnie, and Wendy about Chynna&#x27;s recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. Chynna made it to week four of the competition.

On March 20, 2012, the group appeared on QVC to promote their release &quot;Dedicated&quot;, a studio album composed of covers of songs by both The Beach Boys and The Mamas and the Papas. On April 3, 2012, the group released &quot;Dedicated&quot;, which peaked at number 29 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The trio appeared in their own reality show, &quot;Wilson Phillips: Still Holding On&quot;, which debuted on TV Guide Network in April 2012. In 2015, Wilson Phillips contributed backup vocals to the song &quot;FourFiveSeconds&quot; by Rihanna, Paul McCartney, and Kanye West for Rihanna&#x27;s eighth studio album.

Her father, who was of English, Irish, and Swiss descent, was from a Protestant background.

Brenneman was raised in Glastonbury, Connecticut, where she participated in theatre as a teenager, both in school at Glastonbury High School and with a local theater group. She graduated from Harvard University, where she majored in comparative religion, in 1987. While at Harvard, she co-founded Cornerstone Theatre Company, with which she traveled for several years after graduation.

==Career==

Brenneman began her career in the short-lived CBS series &quot;Middle Ages&quot; in 1992. The next year she was cast in her first major role as mob-connected uniformed officer Janice Licalsi on the ABC police drama series, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. Her story arc, which included a romantic relationship with David Caruso&#x27;s character, ran through the show&#x27;s first season (1993–1994) and the first few episodes of the second season. She was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1994 and for Outstanding Guest Actress the following year.

After leaving &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, Brenneman made her way into film. In 1995, she appeared in &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot;, &quot;Casper&quot;, and the critically acclaimed crime drama &quot;Heat&quot;. In 1996, Brenneman had the female lead role opposite Sylvester Stallone in disaster thriller &quot;Daylight&quot;, and also starred in another thriller, &quot;Fear&quot;. In 1997, she played the leading role in the independent drama film &quot;Nevada&quot;. The next year she starred in &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; directed by Neil LaBute. In 1998–1999 season, she returned to television with a recurring role on the NBC comedy, &quot;Frasier&quot;, as Faye Moskowitz.

In 1999, Brenneman became creator and executive producer of her own television series &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, in which she played the title character. Brenneman portrayed a divorced single mother working as a Family Court Judge in Hartford, Connecticut. The show&#x27;s concept was based on the real-life experiences of her mother, Frederica Brenneman, as a superior court judge in the state of Connecticut. Frederica Brenneman was one of Harvard Law School&#x27;s first female graduates and became a juvenile court judge in Connecticut when Amy was three years old. Amy has said, &quot;I play my mother&#x27;s job, not my mother.&quot; &quot;Judging Amy&quot; ran on CBS for six seasons and 138 episodes from September 19, 1999, to May 3, 2005, to good ratings. In 2002, she was awarded the Women in Film Lucy Award in recognition of her excellence and innovation in her creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.

Brenneman starred in ensemble cast film &quot;Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her&quot; directed by Rodrigo García in 2000. In 2005, she starred in another Rodrigo García&#x27;s independent drama, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;. In 2007, Brenneman played the role of Sylvia Avila in &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot; based on 2004 novel of the same name by Karen Joy Fowler. In 2008, Brenneman co-starred in &quot;88 Minutes&quot; alongside Al Pacino.

In March 2007, Brenneman was cast as Violet Turner in the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; spin-off, &quot;Private Practice&quot;. The Shonda Rhimes series ran on ABC from September 26, 2007, to January 22, 2013. She later starred in films &quot;The Face of Love&quot; and &quot;Words and Pictures&quot;, and was cast in HBO drama series &quot;The Leftovers&quot; opposite Justin Theroux. Also in 2013, Brenneman played the role of Mary of Guise, the series&#x27; lead character&#x27;s mother, in &quot;Reign&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Brenneman married director Brad Silberling in the garden at her parents&#x27; home. They had originally met on the set of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. Brenneman and Silberling have two children, Charlotte Tucker and Bodhi Russell, in Pasadena.

Brenneman is an Episcopalian.

Brenneman signed the &quot;We Had Abortions&quot; petition which appears in the October 2006 issue of &quot;Ms. Magazine&quot;. The petition contains signatures of over 5,000 women declaring that they had an abortion and were &quot;unashamed of the choice they made.&quot;

In the February 28, 2007, all-star benefit reading of &quot;The Gift of Peace&quot; at UCLA&#x27;s Freud Playhouse, she portrays an entrepreneur, alongside actors Ed Asner, Barbara Bain, George Coe, Wendie Malick, and James Pickens, Jr. The play was an open appeal and fundraiser for passage of U.S. House Resolution 808, which sought to establish a Cabinet-level &quot;Department of Peace&quot; in the United States government, funded by a two percent diversion of The Pentagon&#x27;s annual budget.

In July 2008, Brenneman was nominated as a candidate on the Unite for Strength slate for a place on the national governing board of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) in elections scheduled for September 18, 2008. The bid was successful.

Brenneman is also a strong supporter of more restrictive gun laws, and in 2009 she hosted the Target for a Safe America gala at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun control group that favors restrictive gun laws and supports gun bans.

<doc id="704976" wikidata="Q435271" url="?curid=704976" title="Dennis Franz">
<text>Dennis Franz Schlachta (; born October 28, 1944), known professionally as Dennis Franz, is an American retired actor best known for his role as NYPD Detective Andy Sipowicz in the ABC television series &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1993–2005), a role that earned him a Golden Globe Award, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and four Primetime Emmy Awards. He also portrayed two different characters on the similar NBC series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1983, 1985–1987) and its short-lived spinoff, &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot; (1987–1988).

==Early life==
Franz was born October 28, 1944, in Maywood, Illinois, the son of German immigrants Eleanor ( Mueller), a postal worker from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, and Franz Ferdinand Schlachta, who was a baker and postal worker of German and Polish descent. He has two older sisters, Heidi Deigl (born 1935) and Marlene Schraut (born 1938).

Franz is a 1962 graduate of Proviso East High School in Maywood. During his high school years, he was active in baseball, football and swimming. He attended Wilbur Wright College and Southern Illinois University Carbondale, graduating from the latter with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in speech and theater in 1968.

After graduating from college, Franz was drafted into the U.S. Army. He served eleven months with the 82nd Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam.

==Career==

Franz began his acting career at Chicago&#x27;s Organic Theater Company. Although he has in the past performed Shakespeare, his physical appearance led to his being typecast early in his career as a cop. (By Franz&#x27;s own count, the character of Andy Sipowicz was his 28th role as a police officer.) He also guest starred in shows such as &quot;The A-Team&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;. Other major roles were on the television series &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; in which he played two characters over the run of the show. Franz first played the role of the corrupt Detective Sal Benedetto in the 1982–1983 season. Benedetto eventually commits suicide when a large-scale scam he was running fails. Franz returned to the series in 1985 as main character Lt. Norman Buntz, remaining until the show&#x27;s end in 1987. He also starred in the short-lived &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot; as the same character.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Franz worked regularly with directors Brian De Palma and Robert Altman. He appeared in three of Altman&#x27;s films from this period, and five of De Palma&#x27;s. In addition, he appeared as airport police captain Carmine Lorenzo in the 1990 film &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;. His final film role to date was as Nathaniel Messinger in the 1998 film &quot;City of Angels&quot;.
Franz went on to win four Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Andy Sipowicz on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; from 1993 to 2005. The character of Sipowicz was ranked No. 23 on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Greatest TV Characters list. In 1994, while still on NYPD Blue, Franz made a cameo voice appearance as himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer Badman&quot;, in which Homer is accused of sexually harassing a babysitter and the case becomes tabloid fodder, generating an exploitative television movie, &quot;Homer S.: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber&quot;, in which Franz portrays Homer. Franz also voiced Captain Klegghorn, the commanding officer and head of the Anaheim Police Department on the Disney cartoon &quot;Mighty Ducks: The Animated Series&quot;, which ran from September 1996 to January 1997.

In 2000, Franz starred as Earl, an abusive husband, in the Dixie Chicks&#x27; music video &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;. The next year he competed on the May 11 celebrity edition of the hit television game show &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, winning $250,000 for his charity, the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance. As a commercial spokesman for Nextel in the early 2000s, Franz appeared as a caricature of himself in commercials, &quot;refusing&quot; to do the commercials, saying they were not something he did.

===Post-&quot;NYPD Blue&quot;===
After the end of the show in 2005, Franz retired from acting to focus on his private life. He has told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that he would be interested in returning to acting if given the right opportunity. He and his wife spend their summers in their lake home in Northern Idaho. He spoke of wartime experiences and postwar trauma of veterans at a Memorial Day concert in 2012 (speaking in the first person, although it was not his own story). He and his former &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; co-star, Jimmy Smits, made a surprise appearance at the 2016 Primetime Emmy Awards, presenting the award for Outstanding Drama Series to &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Franz married Joanie Zeck; they met in 1982. He is the stepfather of Zeck&#x27;s two daughters from her previous marriage.

<doc id="705004" wikidata="Q1481957" url="?curid=705004" title="Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)">
<text>The Treaty of Fort Laramie (also the Sioux Treaty of 1868) is an agreement between the United States and the Oglala, Miniconjou, and Brulé bands of Lakota people, Yanktonai Dakota, and Arapaho Nation, following the failure of the first Fort Laramie treaty, signed in 1851.

The treaty is divided into 17 articles. It established the Great Sioux Reservation including ownership of the Black Hills, and set aside additional lands as &quot;unceded Indian territory&quot; in the areas of South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, and possibly Montana. It established that the US government would hold authority to punish not only white settlers who committed crimes against the tribes but also tribe members who committed crimes and were to be delivered to the government, rather than to face charges in tribal courts. It stipulated that the government would abandon forts along the Bozeman Trail and included a number of provisions designed to encourage a transition to farming and to move the tribes &quot;closer to the white man&#x27;s way of life.&quot; The treaty protected specified rights of third parties not partaking in the negotiations and effectively ended Red Cloud&#x27;s War. That provision did not include the Ponca, who were not a party to the treaty and so had no opportunity to object when the American treaty negotiators &quot;inadvertently&quot; broke a separate treaty with the Ponca by unlawfully selling the entirety of the Ponca Reservation to the Lakota, pursuant to Article II of this treaty. The United States never intervened to return the Ponca land. Instead, the Lakota claimed the Ponca land as their own and set about attacking and demanding tribute from the Ponca until 1876, when US President Ulysses S. Grant chose to resolve the situation by unilaterally ordering the Ponca removed to the Indian Territory. The removal, known as the Ponca Trail of Tears, was carried out by force the following year and resulted in over 200 deaths.

The treaty was negotiated by members of the government-appointed Indian Peace Commission and signed between April and November 1868 at and near Fort Laramie, in the Wyoming Territory, with the final signatories being Red Cloud himself and others who accompanied him. Animosities over the agreement arose quickly, with open war breaking out again in 1876, and in 1877 the US government unilaterally annexed native land protected under the treaty.

The treaty formed the basis of the 1980 Supreme Court case, &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot;, in which the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the treaty had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest. As of 2018 this amounted to more than $1 billion. The Sioux refused the payment, having demanded instead the return of their land which would not be possible to contest if the monetary compensation was accepted.

==Background==
The first Treaty of Fort Laramie, signed in 1851, attempted to resolve disputes between tribes and the US Government, as well as among tribes themselves, in the modern areas of Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. It set out that the tribes would make peace among one another, allow for certain outside access to their lands (for activities such as travelling, surveying, and the construction of some government outposts and roads), and that tribes would be responsible for wrongs committed by their people. In return, the US Government would offer protection to the tribes, and pay an annuity of $50,000 per year.

No land covered by the treaty was claimed by the US at the time of signing. The five &quot;respective territories&quot; of the participating tribes – Sioux, Arapaho and Cheyenne, Crow, Assiniboine, Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan – were defined. North of the Sioux, the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan held a joint territory. The territory of the Crows extended westward from that of their traditional enemies in the Sioux tribe. The Powder River divided the two lands.

When the Senate reduced the annuity to 10 years from originally 50, all tribes except the Crow accepted the cut. Nevertheless, the treaty was recognized as being in force.

The 1851 treaty had a number of shortcomings which contributed to the deterioration of relations, and subsequent violence over the next several years. From an inter-tribal view, the lack of any &quot;enforcement provisions&quot; protecting the 1851 boundaries proved a drawback for the Crow and the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan. The federal government never kept its obligation to protect tribal resources and hunting grounds, and only made a single payment toward the annuity.

Although the federal government operated via representative democracy, the tribes did so through consensus, and although local chiefs signed the treaty as representatives, they had limited power to control others who themselves had not consented to the terms. This of course is impossible to confirm as the Indians had no writing and hence no way of recording their political philosophy. The discovery of gold in the west, and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, led to substantially increased travel through the area, largely outside the 1851 Sioux territory. This increasingly led to clashes between the tribes, settlers, and the US government, and eventually open war between the Sioux (and the Cheyenne and Arapaho refugees from the Sand Creek massacre in Colorado, 1864) and the whites in 1866.

None of the other tribes signing the 1851 treaty engaged in battle with the US soldiers, and most allied with the Army. With the 1851 intertribal peace soon broken, the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan called for US military support against raiding Sioux Indians in 1855. By summer 1862, the three tribes had abandoned all their permanent villages of earth lodges in the treaty territory south of the Missouri, which was now under Sioux control, and lived together in Like-a-Fishhook Village north of the river.

In the mid-1850s, the western Sioux bands crossed the Powder River and entered the Crow treaty territory. Sioux chief Red Cloud organized a war party against a Crow camp at the mouth of Rosebud River in 1856. Despite the Crows fighting &quot;... large-scale battles with invading Sioux&quot; near present-day Wyola in Montana, the Sioux had taken over the western Powder River area by 1860.

In 1866 the United States Department of the Interior called on tribes to negotiate safe passage through the Bozeman Trail, while the United States Department of War moved Henry B. Carrington, along with a column of 700 men into the Powder River Basin, sparking Red Cloud&#x27;s War. However, most of the wagon track to the city of Bozeman &quot;crossed land guaranteed to the Crows under the 1851 treaty&quot; &quot;... the Sioux attacked the United States anyway, claiming the Yellowstone was now their land.&quot; Red Cloud&#x27;s war &quot;... appeared to be a great Sioux war to protect their land. And it was – but the Sioux had only recently conquered this land from other tribes and now defending the territory both from other tribes&quot; and the passing through of whites. During the war, the Crows sided with the soldiers in the isolated garrisons. Crow warrior Wolf Bow urged the Army to, &quot;Put the Sioux Indians in their own country, and keep them from troubling us.&quot;

After losing resolve to continue the war, following defeat in the Fetterman Fight, sustained guerrilla warfare by the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho, exorbitant rates for freight through the area, and difficulty finding contractors to work the rail lines, the US Government, organized the Indian Peace Commission to negotiate an end to ongoing hostilities. A peace counsel chosen by the government arrived on April 19, 1868, at Fort Laramie, in what would later become the state of Wyoming. The outcome would be the second treaty of Fort Laramie Treaty, signed in 1868.

==Articles==
The treaty was laid out in a series of 17 articles:

===Article I===
Article one called for the cessation of hostilities, stating &quot;all war between the parties to this agreement shall for ever cease.&quot; If crimes were committed by &quot;bad men&quot; among white settlers, the government agreed to arrest and punish the offenders, and reimburse any losses suffered by injured parties. The tribes agreed to turn over criminals among them, any &quot;bad men among the Indians,&quot; to the government for trial and punishment, and to reimburse any losses suffered by injured parties. If any Sioux committed &quot;a wrong or depredation upon the person or property on any one, white, black, or Indians&quot; the US could pay damages taken from the annuities owed the tribes. These terms effectively relinquished the authority of the tribes to punish crimes committed against them by white settlers. In addition, these terms would subject tribal members to judgment under the U.S. government.

Similar provisions appeared in nine such treaties with various tribes. In practice, the &quot;bad men among the whites&quot; clause was seldom enforced. The first plaintiff to win a trial case on the provision did so in 2009, based on the 1868 Fort Laramie treaty.

In 1873, the US exercised the right to withhold annuities and compensate for Sioux wrongs against anyone, including Indians. After a massacre on a moving Pawnee camp during a legal Sioux hunting expedition in Nebraska, the Sioux &quot;were made to pay reparations for the loss of life, meat, hides, equipment, and horses stolen...&quot; The Pawnee received $9,000.

===Article II===

Article two of the treaty changed the boundaries for tribal land and established the Great Sioux Reservation, to include areas of present day South Dakota west of the Missouri River, including the Black Hills. This was set aside for the &quot;absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians&quot;. In total, it allocated about 25% of the Dakota Territory as it existed at the time. It made the total tribal lands smaller, and moved them further eastward. This was to &quot;take away access to the prime buffalo herds that occupied the area and encourage the Sioux to become farmers.&quot;

The government agreed that no parties, other than those authorized by the treaty, would be allowed to &quot;pass over, settle upon, or reside in the territory&quot;. According to one source writing on article two, &quot;What remained unstated in the treaty, but would have been obvious to Sherman and his men, is that land not placed in the reservation was to be considered United States property, and not Indian territory.&quot;

As in 1851, the US recognized most of the land north of the Sioux reservation as Indian territory of the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan. In addition, the US still recognized the 1851 Crow claim to the Indian territory west of the Powder. The Crow and the US came to an agreement about this expanse on May 7, 1868.

With the reservation border following &quot;the northern line of Nebraska&quot;, the Peace Commission ceded to the Sioux the original Ponca Reservation, which had already been guaranteed the Ponca in multiple treaties with the government. &quot;No one has ever been able to explain&quot; this blunder, which was nonetheless enforced by the government, irrespective of their earlier agreements.

===Article III===
Article three provided for allotments of up to of tillable land to be set aside for farming by members of the tribes. By 1871, 200 farms of and 200 farms of had been established including 80 homes. By 1877, this had risen to 153 homes &quot;50 of which had shingle roofs and most had board floors&quot; according to an 1876 report by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

===Article IV===
The government agreed to build a number of buildings on the reservation: 

* Warehouse 
* Store-room 
* Agency building
* Physician residence
* Carpenter residence
* Farmer residence 
* Blacksmith residence
* Miller residence
* Engineer residence
* School house
* Saw mill
Article four also provided for the establishment of an agency on the reservation for the purpose of government administration. In practice, five were constructed and two more later added. These original five were composed of the Grand River Agency (Later Standing Rock), Cheyenne River Agency, Whetstone Agency, Crow Creek Agency, and Lower Brulé Agency. Another would later be set up on the White River, and again on the North Platte River, but would later be moved to also be on the White.

===Articles V through X===
The government agreed that the agent for the Bureau of Indian Affairs shall keep his office open to complaints, which he will investigate and forward to the Commissioner. The decision of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of the Interior, &quot;shall be binding on the parties&quot;.

Article six laid out provisions for members of the tribes to take legal individual ownership of previously commonly held land, up to for the heads of families, and for any adult who was not the head of a family. This land then &quot;may be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, so long as he or they may continue to cultivate it.&quot;

Article seven addressed education for those aged six to 16, in order, as the treaty states, to &quot;insure the civilization of the Indians entering into this treaty&quot;. The tribes agreed to compel both male and females to attend school, and the government agreed to provide a schoolhouse and teacher for every 30 students who could be made to attend.

In article eight, the government agreed to provide seeds, tools, and training for any of the residents who selected tracts of land, and agreed to farm them. This was to be in the amount of up to $100 worth for the first year, and up to $25 worth for the second and third years. These were one of a number of provisions of the treaty designed to encourage farming, rather than hunting, and move the tribes &quot;closer to the white man&#x27;s way of life.&quot;

After 10 years the government was able to withdraw the individuals from article 13, but if so, it would provide $10,000 annually &quot;devoted to the education of said Indians ... as will best promote the education and moral improvement of said tribes.&quot; These were to be managed by a local Indian agent under the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

Article 10 provided for an allotment of clothes, and food, in addition to one &quot;good American cow&quot; and two oxen for each lodge or family who moved to the reservation. It further provided for an annual payment over 30 years of $10 for each person who hunted, and $20 for those who farmed, to be used by the Secretary of the Interior for the &quot;purchase of such articles as from time to time the condition and necessities of the Indians may indicate to be proper.&quot;

===Article XI===

Article 11 included several provisions stating the tribes agreed to withdraw opposition to the construction of railroads (mentioned three times), military posts and roads, and will not attack or capture white settlers or their property. The same guarantee protected third parties defined as &quot;persons friendly&quot; with the United States. The government agreed to reimburse the tribes for damages caused in the construction of works on the reservation, in the amount assessed by &quot;three disinterested commissioners&quot; appointed by the President. It guaranteed the tribes access to the area to the north and west of the Black Hills as hunting grounds, &quot;so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase.&quot;

As one source examined the treaty language with regard to &quot;so long as the buffalo may range&quot;, the tribes considered this language to be a perpetual guarantee, because &quot;they could not envision a day when buffalo would not roam the plains&quot;; however:

The concept was clear enough to the commissioners … [who] well knew that hide hunters, with Sherman&#x27;s blessing, were already beginning the slaughter that would eventually drive the Indians to complete dependence on the government for their existence.

Despite Sioux promises of undisturbed construction of railroads and no attacks, more than 10 surveying crew members, US Army Indian scouts and soldiers were killed in 1872 and 1873.

Because of the Sioux massacre on the Pawnee in southern Nebraska during a hunting expedition in 1873, the US banned such hunts outside the reservation. Thus, the US decision nullified a part of Article XI.

===Article XII===
Article 12 required the agreement of &quot;three-fourths of all the adult male Indians&quot; for a treaty with the tribes to &quot;be of any validity&quot;. Hedren reflected on article 12 writing that the provision indicated the government &quot;already anticipated a time when different needs would demand the abrogation of the treaty terms.&quot; These provisions have since been controversial, because subsequent treaties amending that of 1868 did not include the required agreement of three-fourths of adult males, and so under the terms of 1868, are invalid.

===Articles XIII through XV===
The government agreed to furnish the tribes with a &quot;physician, teachers, carpenter, miller, engineer, farmer, and blacksmiths&quot;.

The government agreed to provide $100 in prizes for those who &quot;in the judgment of the agent may grow the most valuable crops for the respective year.&quot; Once the promised buildings were constructed, the tribes agreed to regard the reservation as their &quot;permanent home&quot; and make &quot;no permanent settlement elsewhere&quot;.

===Article XVI===

Article 16 stated that country north of the North Platte River and east of the summits of the Big Horn Mountains would be &quot;unceded Indian territory&quot; that no white settlers could occupy without the consent of the tribes. This included of land outside the reservation which were previously set aside by the 1851 treaty, as well as around an additional . As part of this, the government agreed to close the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail. Article 16 did not however, address issues related to important hunting grounds north and northwest of the reservation. The Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan held the treaty right to the bigger part of those hunting grounds according to the 1851 treaty. With the 1868 treaty, the Sioux ceded land to the US directly north of the reservation.

This article proclaims the shift of the Indian title to the land east of the summits of the Big Horn Mountains to Powder River (the combat zone of Red Cloud&#x27;s War). In 1851, the US had acknowledged the claim of the Crow to this area. Following defeat, the Peace Commission recognized it as &quot;unceded Indian territory&quot; held by the Sioux. The US Government could only dispose of Crow treaty territory, because it held parallel negotiations with the Crow tribe. The talks ended on May 7, 1868. The Crows accepted to give up large tracts of land to the US and settle on a reservation in the heart of the 1851 territory.

It was possible for the Peace Commission to allow the Sioux to hunt on the Republican Fork in Nebraska (200 miles south of the Sioux reservation) along with others, because the US held the title to this river area. The Cheyenne and Arapaho had ceded the western part of the Republican Fork in 1861 in a more-or-less well-understood treaty. The US had bought the eastern part of the Republican Fork from the Pawnee in 1833. The Pawnee held a treaty right to hunt in their ceded territory. In 1873, the Massacre Canyon battle took place here.

===Article XVII===
The treaty, as agreed to &quot;shall be construed as abrogating and annulling all treaties and agreements heretofore entered into.&quot;

==Signing==
Over the course of 192 days ending November 6, the treaty was signed by a total of 156 Sioux, and 25 Arapaho, in addition to the commissioners, and an additional 34 signatories as witnesses. Although the commissioners signed the document on April 29 along with the Brulé, the party broke up in May, with only two remaining at Fort Laramie to conclude talks there, before traveling up the Missouri River to gather additional signatures from tribes elsewhere. Throughout this process, no further amendments were made to the terms. As one writer phrased it, &quot;the commissioners essentially cycled Sioux in and out of Fort Laramie ... seeking only the formality of the chiefs&#x27; marks and forgoing true agreement in the spirit that the Indians understood it.&quot;

Following initial negotiations, those from the Peace Commission did not discuss the conditions of the treaty to subsequent tribes who arrived over the following months to sign. Rather, the treaty was read aloud, and it was permitted &quot;some time for the chiefs to speak&quot; before &quot;instructing them to place their marks on the prepared document.&quot; As the source continues:

These tribes had little interest in or understanding of what had taken place at the Fort Laramie councils. They wanted the whites out of their country and would fight as long as necessary.

The process of abandoning the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail, as part of the conditions agreed to, proved to be a long process, and was stalled by difficulty arranging the sale of the goods from the fort to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Fort C.F. Smith was not emptied until July 29. Fort Phil Kearny and Fort Reno were not emptied until August 1. Once abandoned, Red Cloud and his followers, who had been monitoring the activities of the troops rode down and burned what remained.

The peace commission dissolved on October 10 after presenting its report to Congress, which among other things, recommended the government &quot;cease to recognize the Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations,&quot; and that no further &quot;treaties shall be made with any Indian tribe.&quot; William Dye, the commander at Fort Laramie was left to represent the commission, and met with Red Cloud, who was among the last to sign the treaty on November 6. The government remained unwilling to negotiate the terms further, and after two days, Red Cloud is reported to have &quot;washed his hands with the dust of the floor&quot; and signed, formally ending the war.

The US Senate ratified the treaty on February 16, 1869.

==Aftermath and legacy==

Although the treaty required the consent of three-fourths of the men of the tribes, many did not sign or recognize the results. Others would later complain that the treaty contained complex language that was not well explained in order to avoid arousing suspicion. Yet others would not fully learn the terms of the agreement until 1870, when Red Cloud returned from a trip to Washington D.C.

The treaty overall, and in comparison with the 1851 agreement, represented a departure from earlier considerations of tribal customs, and demonstrated instead the government&#x27;s &quot;more heavy-handed position with regard to tribal nations, and ... desire to assimilate the Sioux into American property arrangements and social customs.&quot;

According to one source, &quot;animosities over the treaty arose almost immediately&quot; when a group of Miniconjou were informed they were no longer welcome to trade at Fort Laramie, being south of their newly established territory. This was notwithstanding that the treaty did not make any stipulation that the tribes could not travel outside their land, only that they would not permanently occupy outside land. The only travel expressly forbidden by the treaty was that of white settlers onto the reservation.

Although a treaty between the US and the Sioux, it had profound effect on the Crow tribe, since it held the title to some of the territories set aside in the new treaty. By entering the peace talks &quot;... the government had in effect betrayed the Crows, who had willingly helped the army to hold the [Bozeman Trail] posts ...&quot;.

When the Sioux Indians had stopped the advance of the US in 1868, they quickly resumed their &quot;own program of expansions&quot; into the adjoining Indian territories. Although all parties took and gave, the Sioux and their allies once again threatened the homeland of some of the Indian nations around them. Attacks on the Crows and the Shoshones were &quot;frequent, both by the Northern Cheyennes and by the Arapahos, as well as the Sioux, and by parties made up from all three tribes&quot;. The Crows reported Sioux Indians in the Bighorn area from 1871. This eastern part of the Crow reservation was taken over a few years later by the Sioux in quest of buffalo. When a force of Sioux warriors confronted a Crow reservation camp at Pryor Creek in 1873 throughout a whole day, Crow chief Blackfoot called for decisive actions against the Indian intruders by the US. In 1876, the Crows (and the Eastern Shoshones) fought alongside the Army at the Rosebud. They scouted for Custer against the Sioux, &quot;who were now in the old Crow country&quot;.

Both the tribes and the government chose to ignore portions of the treaty, or to &quot;comply only as long as conditions met their favor,&quot; and between 1869 and 1876, at least seven separate skirmishes occurred within the vicinity of Fort Laramie. Prior to the Black Hills expedition, Army sources mention attacks in Montana north of the Yellowstone and north of the Sioux reservation in North Dakota carried out by unidentified groups of Sioux. Large war parties of Sioux Indians left their reservation to attack distant Indian enemies near Like-a-Fishhook Village. The first talks of actions against the Sioux arose. In his 1873 report, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs advocated, &quot;that those [Sioux] Indians roaming west of the Dakota line be forced by the military to come in to the Great Sioux Reservation.&quot;

The government eventually broke the terms of the treaty following the Black Hills Gold Rush and an expedition into the area by George Armstrong Custer in 1874, and failed to prevent white settlers from moving onto tribal lands. Rising tensions eventually led again to open conflict in the Great Sioux War of 1876.

The 1868 treaty would be modified three times by the US Congress between 1876 and 1889, each time taking more land originally granted, including unilaterally seizing the Black Hills in 1877.

===United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians===

On June 30, 1980, the US Supreme Court ruled that the government had illegally taken land in the Black Hills granted by the 1868 treaty, by unlawfully abrogating article two of the agreement during negotiations in 1876, while failing to achieve the signatures of two-thirds the adult male population required to do so. It upheld an award of $15.5 million for the market value of the land in 1877, along with 103 years worth of interest at 5 percent, for an additional $105 million. The Lakota Sioux, however, have refused to accept payment and instead continue to demand the return of the territory from the United States. the Sioux interest on the money has compounded to over 1 billion dollars.

===Commemoration===
Marking the 150th anniversary of the treaty, the South Dakota Legislature passed Senate Resolution 1, reaffirming the legitimacy of the treaty, and according to the original text, illustrating to the federal government that the Sioux are &quot;still here&quot; and are &quot;seeking a future of forward-looking, positive relationships with full respect for the sovereign status of Native American nations confirmed by the treaty.&quot;

On March 11, 2018, the Governor of Wyoming, Matt Mead signed a similar bill into law, calling on &quot;the federal government to uphold its federal trust responsibilities,&quot; and calling for a permanent display of the original treaty, on file with the National Archives and Records Administration, in the Wyoming Legislature.

===Herrera v. Wyoming===
In May 2019, in a 5–4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the &quot;Herrera v. Wyoming&quot; case that Wyoming&#x27;s statehood did not void hunting rights which were guaranteed to the Crow tribe by the treaty.

<doc id="705008" wikidata="Q7164702" url="?curid=705008" title="Pensacola Pelicans">
<text>The Pensacola Pelicans were a minor league baseball team based in Pensacola, Florida. In various incarnations, they played in three different independent baseball leagues (leagues unaffiliated with Major League Baseball) from 2002 to 2010. They played their games at Pelican Park.

The initial incarnations Pelicans began play in 2002 as charter members of the new, independent Southeastern League. The league folded after the 2003 season, and team owner Quint Studer purchased a franchise in the Central Baseball League, moving the Pelicans to the new organization. When the CBL folded in 2004 the Pelicans joined the new American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. They won the Southeastern League championship in 2002.

In 2010 Studer sold his American Association franchise to a group in Amarillo, Texas as part of a move to bring Class Double-A affiliated baseball to Pensacola. The franchise became the Amarillo Sox for the 2011 season; the new team, the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, began play in 2012.

==History==
===Independent leagues===
The Pensacola Pelicans were incorporated in 2002, when the Southeastern League decided to place a team in the Pensacola area. Midway through the 2002 season, Quint Studer and his wife Rishy Studer bought the team from the league and was approved under the Commissioner James Gamble. The 2002 season was a very successful one for the Pelicans; they had the league&#x27;s best record and won the championship in an extra-innings victory against the Montgomery Wings. The 2003 season was also successful, with the Pelicans once again claiming the league&#x27;s best record, but losing to the Baton Rouge Riverbats in the championship series.

Before the 2004 season, the affiliated Orlando Rays of the Southern League moved to Montgomery, Alabama, the location of a key Southeastern League franchise. Unable to compete with an affiliated baseball club in one of its cities, the Southeastern League folded, and the Pelicans were left without a league in which to play.

In order to join the Central Baseball League for the 2004 season, Pelicans owner Studer purchased the rights to the Springfield Ozark Mountain Ducks franchise, and the Pelicans took that team&#x27;s spot in the league. Former major league standout Bernie Carbo was the team&#x27;s manager and he was aided by former major leaguer Pedro Borbon as pitching coach.

The CBL folded in 2005 and the Pelicans joined the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball after the 2005 season, and named Kash Beauchamp as manager. After leading the Pelicans to a 39–57 season, Beauchamp was released of his managerial duties. The Pelicans were led by Mac Seibert in 2007 and 2008, finishing 39–56 in &#x27;07 and 43–53 in &#x27;08. Seibert left after his second year to take a job in the New York Mets organization. The Pelicans won the South Division in 2009, making the championship round before losing to the Lincoln Saltdogs in 5 games.

===Southern League===
In 2010 Studer orchestrated a complicated series of purchases and moves to bring affiliated Class Double-A baseball to Pensacola. First, he sold his American Association franchise to a group in Amarillo, Texas, where they became the Amarillo Sox, now known as the Amarillo Thunderheads. Then, he purchased the Carolina Mudcats, a Southern League team from Zebulon, North Carolina. To settle the deal, however, he had to facilitate the move of the Kinston Indians to Zebulon, where they took up the Mudcats name. Additionally, as Pensacola is within the franchise territory of the Mobile BayBears, he had to compensate that team. The arrangements cost Studer a total of $2 million.

It was initially reported that Studer&#x27;s team would take up the Pelicans name, but it was later announced a new name would be chosen by fan contest. Per said contest, the team was named the Pensacola Blue Wahoos; they began play in the Southern League in 2012.

<doc id="705022" wikidata="Q158427" url="?curid=705022" title="German cruiser Deutschland">
<text>&#x27; was the lead ship of her class of heavy cruisers (often termed pocket battleships) which served with the of Nazi Germany during World War II. Ordered by the Weimar government for the , she was laid down at the shipyard in Kiel in February 1929 and completed by April 1933. Originally classified as an armored ship () by the , in February 1940 the Germans reclassified the remaining two ships of this class as heavy cruisers. In 1940, she was renamed &#x27;, after the unfinished heavy cruiser was sold to the Soviet Union the previous year.

The ship saw significant action with the , including several non-intervention patrols in the Spanish Civil War, during which she was attacked by Republican bombers in the Deutschland incident. At the outbreak of World War II, she was cruising the North Atlantic, prepared to attack Allied merchant traffic. Bad weather hampered her efforts, and she sank or captured only a handful of vessels before returning to Germany. She then participated in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway. Damaged at the Battle of Drøbak Sound, she was recalled to Germany for repairs. While en route, she was torpedoed and seriously damaged by a British submarine.

Repairs were completed by March 1941, and in June she left Germany for a commerce raiding operation in the Atlantic. Before reaching the Atlantic, she was torpedoed by a British aircraft and had to return. After repairs, returned to Norway to join the forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She ran aground during Operation Rösselsprung, a planned attack on Convoy PQ 17, and returned to Germany for repairs. She next saw action at the Battle of the Barents Sea with the heavy cruiser , which ended with a failure to destroy Convoy JW 51B. Engine problems forced a series of repairs culminating in a complete overhaul at the end of 1943, after which the ship remained in the Baltic as a training ship. In October 1944 re-entered front line service with Task Force Thiele, participating in shore bombardments of Russian positions in support of the German army. Sunk in shallow waters in the in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, was used as a stationary gun battery until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a target in the Baltic.

== Design ==
 was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of , though the ship was officially stated to be within the limit of the Treaty of Versailles. was powered by four sets of MAN 9-cylinder double-acting two-stroke diesel engines. The ship&#x27;s top speed was , at . At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for .

Since the Treaty of Versailles limited the total strength of the to 10,000 men, could not take on a full complement. Only 33 officers, 595 enlisted men and 15 civilians could be taken aboard, 474 of them came from the light cruiser , which was temporarily decommissioned to provide men for . After 1935, when Adolf Hitler renounced the Treaty of Versailles and concluded the Anglo-German Naval Agreement these restrictions were lifted and received a full complement of 43 officers, 943 sailors and 14 civilians. When prepared for war patrols, more officers and crew were taken aboard in order to establish prize crews for captured merchant ships.

″s primary armament was six SK C/28 guns mounted in two triple gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The ship carried a secondary battery of eight SK C/28 guns in single turrets grouped amidships. Her anti-aircraft battery originally consisted of three L/45 guns, though in 1935 these were replaced with six 8.8 cm L/78 guns. Two SL-2 stabilized anti-aircraft director posts were also installed for these guns, one above the signals bridge and one abaft the funnel. In 1940, the 8.8 cm guns were removed, and six L/65 guns, four guns, and ten guns were installed in their place. By the end of the war, her anti-aircraft battery had again been reorganized, consisting of six L/60 guns, ten 3.7 cm guns, and twenty-eight 2 cm guns.

The ship also carried a pair of quadruple deck-mounted torpedo tubes placed on her stern. The ship was initially not equipped equipped with seaplanes but became in 1935 the first German warship to install a catapult, seaplane handling cranes and a Heinkel He 60 floatplane. ″s armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick while the main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 80 mm thick sides. In Autumn 1937 a FMG G(gO) &quot;Seetakt&quot; set radar operating on a Wavelength of 80 cm was installed; in 1942, a FuMO 26 set was added.

== Service history ==
 was ordered by the Reichsmarine from the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel as , a replacement for the old pre-dreadnought battleship . Her keel was laid on 5 February 1929, under construction number 219. The ship was launched on 19 May 1931; at her launching, the ship accidentally started sliding down the slipway while German Chancellor Heinrich Brüning.was giving the christening speech and before German President Paul von Hindenburg could christen the ship with the traditional bottle of Sekt. After the completion of fitting out work, initial sea trials began in November 1932. The ship was commissioned into the on 1 April 1933.

 spent the majority of 1933 and 1934 conducting training maneuvers; early speed trials in May 1933 indicated that a top speed of was preferable, but the ship comfortably reached on speed trials in June. Trials were completed by December 1933, and the ship was ready for active service with the fleet. The ship also made a series of goodwill visits to foreign ports, including visits to Gothenburg, Sweden, and in October 1934, a formal state visit to Edinburgh, Scotland. In April 1934, Adolf Hitler visited the ship; he reportedly toured the ship alone, speaking informally with crewmen.

The ship conducted a series of long-distance training voyages into the Atlantic in 1935. In March 1935, she sailed as far as the Caribbean and South American waters. After returning to Germany, she went into dock for routine maintenance work, as well as installation of additional equipment. She had her aircraft catapult installed in this period, and was provided with a He 60 floatplane. The first He 60 was damaged during the tests with a new helping device for landing and recovering floatplanes, and a replacement He 60 was flown in. participated in fleet maneuvers in German waters in early 1936. She was joined by her newly commissioned sister ship for a cruise into the mid-Atlantic, which included a stop in Madeira.

=== Spanish Civil War ===
Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, and were deployed to the Spanish coast on 23 July 1936 to cover the evacuation of diplomatic personnel and civilians from Spanish ports. At the end of August, she assisted in the evacuation of San Sebastián, Bilbao, Santander, Gijón and A Coruña on the Atlantic coast, followed in July by Cádiz, Almería, Ceuta, Málaga, Alicante, Valencia and Barcelona. During the deployment, her gun turrets were painted with large black, white, and red bands to aid in identification from the air and indicate her neutral status. By end October, the German navy had evacuated 15,317 people, amongst them many foreigners. On 31 August, was back in Wilhelmshaven.

On 1 October, left Germany for Spain on her first non-intervention patrol off the Republican-held coast of Spain. Her duties during the deployment included evacuating refugees fleeing from the fighting, protecting German ships carrying supplies for Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists, and gathering intelligence for the Nationalists. On 21 November, the ship was back in Germany but left from Kiel for her third patrol on 31 January 1937. On this patrol, her main duty was to control Spanish ships in the Mediterranean Sea and verify if a Non-Intervention Committee observer was aboard in order to avoid the transport of arms or international volunteers trying to join the Republican side. In April, returned to Germany but on 10 May the ship embarked upon her fourth patrol. By this time the Non-Intervention Committee had divided the Spanish coast in four sectors and Germany was allocated the coast between Portugal and Valencia. made a visit to the British base in Gibraltar and participated in exercises together with a British and an Italian cruiser.

On 24 May 1937, the ship was docked in the port of Palma on the island of Majorca, along with several other neutral warships, including vessels from the British and Italian navies. The port was attacked by Republican aircraft, though anti-aircraft fire from the warships drove them off. The torpedo boats and escorted to the island of Ibiza on 26 May. While moored in port there, she was again attacked on 29 May by Republican bombers; a pair of Soviet-built SB-2 bombers, secretly flown by Soviet Air Force pilots, bombed the ship. At the same time four Republican destroyers shelled the port with inaccurate fire. Two bombs struck the ship; the first penetrated the upper deck near the bridge and exploded above the main armored deck while the second hit near the third starboard 15 cm gun. Splinters from this hit perforated the seaplane fuel tanks and set it on fire, the burning fuel igniting the munitions for the starboard 15 cm guns. The first hit caused serious fires below decks. The attack killed 31 German sailors and wounded 74.

 quickly weighed anchor and left port. She rendezvoused with to take on additional doctors before proceeding to Gibraltar where the dead were buried with full military honors. Ten days later, however, Hitler ordered the men be exhumed and returned for burial in Germany. The ship&#x27;s wounded men were also evacuated in Gibraltar for treatment. Hitler, furious over the attack, ordered to bombard the port of Almería in retaliation for the so-called &quot;&quot;Deutschland&quot; incident&quot;. Stalin subsequently issued orders that further attacks on German and Italian warships were strictly prohibited. On 15 June, was back in Wilhelmshaven where the 31 deceased sailors were buried. Repairs of the bomb damage took ten days. On 1 October, &quot;KzS&quot; Paul Wenneker took command of . His first assignment was taking the ship once more to patrol off Spain to protect merchant shipping. During this patrol she was replenished in Italian ports. In February 1938 she was back in Germany. By now the ship had sailed over 130,000 nautical miles and her motor room was in need of an extensive overhaul. Especially the diesel engine mountings proved to be too fragile and suffered from cracking.

=== Pre-war maneuvres ===
Rising tensions with France and the UK during the Sudeten crisis in September 1938 led to war preparations: on 20 September left Germany to take up a position in the Mid-Atlantic in order to wage commerce raiding on the shipping lanes to South America and Cape of Good Hope. The replenishment oiler was also sent into the Atlantic to support during her operations, but first replenished from the tanker in the Spanish port Vigo. There she made the first operational use of her Seetakt radar to slip out of Vigo in dense fog, and escaped her British shadowers. With the Munich Agreement on 29 September, a war was avoided. continued her patrol for training purposes. She simulated war operations together with the U-boats and . It proved to be too difficult to direct U-boats operating independently from a ship at sea, and as a result, the advocated by Karl Dönitz became more prominent. paid a visit to Tangier and Gibraltar before returning to Germany. Between 6 and 26 February the ship was again in Spanish waters, for gunnery exercises and visits to Palma, Tenerife and Ferrol.

On 23 March 1939 Hitler boarded in Swinemünde to lead the ship to Memel which was then part of Lithuania, and which he wanted Heim ins Reich. Faced with the arrival of , its two sister ships and , the light cruisers , , and , and several destroyers, torpedo boats and mine sweepers, the Lithuanian government accepted the German ultimatum to Lithuania and ceded the Memel region to Germany.

On 17 April left for the Atlantic under the command of the Wilhelm Marschall. During the sortie a new type of commerce raiding was exercised: the should operate in a task force together with reconnaissance forces and the new s. In the absence of the not yet operational or the yet-to-build , three destroyers operated as support for . After the conclusion of the exercises the German force paid an official visit to Malaga following the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War 1939. Together with the ships stationed in the Mediterranean during their now-concluded Spain patrols, and the new battleship coming from Germany, the German forces started a major fleet exercise. At the core of the exercise were some twenty U-boats directed by Dönitz from the submarine tender , simulating attacks on a convoy, whilst the surface ships focused on the diversion of the enemy forces.

=== World War II ===
On 24 August 1939, a week before the German invasion of Poland, set sail from Wilhelmshaven, bound for a position south of Greenland. Here, she would be ready to attack Allied merchant traffic in the event of a general war following the attack on Poland. The supply ship &quot;Westerwald&quot; was assigned to support during the operation. Just two days before leaving Wilhelmshaven, her obsolete He 60 biplane floatplane was replaced by a modern Ar 196 with closed cockpit. After reaching the Atlantic through the Denmark Strait, received the first replenishment from on 30 August close to Greenland. was ordered to strictly observe prize rules, which required raiders to stop and search ships for contraband before sinking them, and to ensure that their crews are safely evacuated. The ship was also ordered to avoid combat with even inferior naval forces, as commerce disruption was the primary objective. Hitler hoped to secure a negotiated peace with Britain and France after he overran Poland, and he therefore did not authorize to begin her raiding mission against British and French shipping until 26 September. By this time, had moved south to hunt in the Bermuda-Azores sea lane.

On 5 October, she found and sank the British transport ship &quot;Stonegate&quot;, though not before the freighter was able to send a distress signal informing vessels in the area of &quot;Deutschland&quot;″s presence. She then turned north to the Halifax route, where on 9 October, she encountered the American ship . The freighter was found to be carrying contraband, and so was seized. A prize crew was dispatched to the ship; they took the ship with the original crew held prisoner to Germany via Murmansk. The ship was seized by Norway when she anchored in Haugesund, however, and control of the ship was returned to the original crew. Meanwhile, on 14 October, encountered and sank the Norwegian transport , of some . The same day, she stopped the neutral Danish steamer , though when it became apparent that she was headed for a neutral port, the prisoners from were placed aboard her and she was allowed to proceed. later reported the encounter to the British Royal Navy and confirmed as the raider operating in the North Atlantic.

Severe weather in the North Atlantic hampered ″s raiding mission, though she did tie down several British warships assigned to track her down. The French , centered on the battleship , was occupied with protecting convoys around Britain to prevent them from being attacked by . In early November, the Naval High Command recalled ; she passed through the Denmark Strait on 15 November and anchored in Gotenhafen on the 17th. In the course of her raiding mission, she sank only two vessels and captured a third. 

Immediately after her arrival in Germany, was re-rated as a heavy cruiser and renamed . Hitler himself made the decision to rename the ship, recognizing that the sinking of a warship, always possible, was a propaganda disaster if it bore the name of its country. Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander in chief of the , also hoped that renaming the ship would confuse Allied intelligence; the was designated for sale to the Soviet Navy, and it was hoped that the use of her name for would hide the transaction. Since had returned undetected to Germany, the renaming would also fool the British into believing was still operating in the Atlantic and commit its forces into searching her there. Before went into harbor for refit, she participated in the fleet operations in the North Sea in support of the attack of the German battleships and on the Northern Patrol. On 24 and 25 November, operated together with the light cruisers and in the Skagerrak against merchant traffic and as a decoy for the battleships operations.

In early December 1939, the ship underwent a big overhaul, during which a raked clipper bow was installed to improve her sea-keeping qualities. In February 1940 Wenneker was promoted to and was replaced by &quot;KzS&quot; August Thiele. The refit was completed in March 1940, after which it was intended to send the ship on another commerce-raiding operation into the South Atlantic. In April she was assigned to forces participating in the invasion of Norway.

==== Operation Weserübung ====
The Germans planned to start the invasion of Norway with landings by six naval forces in Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, Kristiansand, Oslo and Egersund. was initially assigned to Group2 together with the heavy cruiser , tasked to occupy Trondheim. After the landings at Trondheim, was to break out to the Atlantic for commerce-raiding. But on 4 April cracks were discovered in the diesel engine mountings which reduced the top speed of the cruiser to 21 knots and mandated further repairs in Germany. As a consequence, the Atlantic sortie was cancelled and was re-assigned to Group 5, alongside the new heavy cruiser , the light cruiser and the torpedo boats &quot;Albatros&quot;, and under the command of Oskar Kummetz. Kummetz flew his flag in . Group 5 was tasked with capturing Oslo, the capital of Norway, and transported a force of 2,000 mountain troops from the Wehrmacht. embarked over 400 of the soldiers for the voyage to Norway. After the negative experiences during the Atlantic sortie in 1939 with the single Ar 196 floatplane often breaking down, received a spare Ar 196 which was stored behind the stack. The force left Germany on 8 April and passed through the Kattegat. While en route, several submarine alarms were given. fired a broadside with the secondary artillery in the direction of a detected periscope, only resulting in blast damage to the seaplane on the catapult which was disabled. In the evening the British submarine attacked the flotilla; identifying as the main threat, &quot;Triton&quot; fired a full spread of ten torpedoes at her but missed as was turning away at the right time on a zigzag course. The German torpedo boats drove the submarine off. 

Shortly before midnight on the night of 8 April, Group 5, with in the lead, passed the outer ring of Norwegian coastal batteries. followed directly behind the flagship, with astern. Heavy fog and neutrality requirements, which required the Norwegians to fire warning shots, permitted the Germans to avoid damage. The Norwegians, including those manning the guns at the Oscarsborg Fortress were on alert, however. Steaming into the Oslofjord at a speed of , the Germans came into range of the Norwegian guns; the 28 cm, 15 cm and 57 mm guns opened fire on the invaders. During the ensuing Battle of Drøbak Sound, was hit by many shells and two torpedoes. She quickly capsized and sank with the loss of approximately 1,000 sailors and soldiers. was hit three times by 15 cm shells from Oscarsborg&#x27;s Kopås battery, causing significant damage.
″s forward gun turret was hit by one of the 15 cm rounds, which disabled the center gun and damaged the right barrel. Four men were wounded. A second shell struck the ship&#x27;s deck and penetrated the upper and main armored decks; starting a fire in the cruiser&#x27;s hospital and operating theater, killing two soldiers and severely wounding six others. A third struck her superstructure behind the port-side aircraft crane. The spare aircraft stored behind the stack was severely damaged, and four gunners were killed by the third shell. The ship was only able to fire her secondary battery in return. The heavy damage forced and the rest of the squadron to reverse course and exit the fjord. She eventually landed her troop complement in Verle Bay, after which she used her operational 28 cm guns to provide fire support. By the afternoon of 9 April, most of the Norwegian fortresses had been captured and the commander of the remaining Norwegian forces opened negotiations for surrender. The delay had, however, allowed enough time for the Norwegian government and royal family to flee Oslo.

The damage sustained prompted the to order her to return to Germany for repairs, the rest of Group 5 remained in Norway. Despite the danger of submarines, which had attacked and sunk many ships during operation Weserübung, Thiele ordered his available escorts, the torpedo boats and to stay back to assist the damaged and relied on ″s top speed of 24 knots to avoid submarines. Nevertheless, the British submarine attacked the ship on 11 April and scored a serious hit. The torpedo destroyed ″s stern, causing it to collapse and nearly fall off, and blew off her steering gear. Unable to steer, she was towed back to port and decommissioned for repairs, which lasted for nearly a year. During the attack on Norway, the ship suffered nineteen dead, and another fifteen were killed by the torpedo strike. Despite the setback, Thiele was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions during the Battle of Drøbak Sound, during which he took command of the task force after the loss of .

During her time in drydock and on the dockside in Kiel, was often attacked by British bombers. Only during the night of 8 July the bombers managed to score a hit on the forecastle, but the bomb failed to explode. The cruiser was recommissioned for service on 31 March 1941 under a new commander, KzS Leo Kreisch. The initially planned to send the ship on the commerce raiding operation planned the previous year. Her sister ship had successfully concluded such an operation in March 1941 and was to join for the operation in July. Despite the loss of the battleship and Hitler&#x27;s instruction not to take risks with the big ships, on 12 June departed for Operation Sommerreise, escorted by the destroyers , , , and . The destroyers were to provide escort until Norway, for escort and scouting in the Denmark Strait the U-boats and were detached from their Atlantic operations. A single British Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber found off Egersund during the night. The bomber held off its attack until the Germans were deceived into thinking it was a German patrol aircraft and then scored a hit that disabled her electrical system and rendered the ship motionless. Only three sailors were wounded, but took on a severe list to port and the port shaft was damaged. The smokescreen generator was activated by the torpedo hit which caused a second attacking torpedo bomber to miss the ship. The crew effected emergency repairs that allowed her to return to Germany; repair work in Kiel took six months. By 10 May 1942, the ship was finally pronounced ready for action.

==== Deployment to Norway ====
In Operation Waltzertraum left Swinemünde on 15 May 1942 for Norway to join forces intended to disrupt Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She was escorted by the destroyers , , and and the escort &quot;F1&quot;. At the same time the damaged heavy cruiser returned following makeshift repairs from Trondheim to Germany. There was heavy British air and submarine activity against the two forces; whilst was able to break through to Germany, sought shelter in Kristiansand on 17 May. Between 18 and 20 May was moving in stages to Trondheim with her four destroyers and the torpedo boat . By 25 May she had joined in Bogen Bay. She was made the flagship of the now Kummetz, the commander of 2. Fuel shortages restricted operations, although and were able to conduct limited battle training exercises. In July fuel stocks were sufficient to allow operations with capital ships and the Germans intended to attack the next convoy PQ 17 with the complete surface fleet in Operation Rösselsprung. On 1 July the convoy was located by the B-Dienst and detected by U-boats. The next day, the first stage of Operation Rösselsprung was set in motion when German forces concentrated in Altafjord from where they could sortie against the convoy. 

On 2 July, the battleship , the heavy cruiser , the destroyers , , and , and the torpedo boats and left Trondheim for Altafjord, followed on 3 July by the cruisers and and the destroyers , , , , and coming from Narvik. In order to avoid British reconnaissance, the German fleet did not steer into open waters but remained close to the coast and between islands. In fog ran aground in the narrow Tjeldsundet, and the destroyers , and struck uncharted rocks at Grimsöy in Vestfjorden and all these ships fell out for the operation. Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty, which ordered the convoy to disperse in the evening of 4 July. In the morning of 5 July the Germans became aware that the escorts were withdrawing and the merchants were continuing independently. The second stage of Operation Rösselsprung was initiated at 11:37 and the German fleet minus left Altafjord to attack the convoy. During the evening it became clear that they had been detected and the Germans aborted the operation. U-boats and Luftwaffe sank 21 of the 34 fleeing transports. 

The grounding at Tjeldsundet had damaged the outer hull over a length of 80 meter. The bottom was bent 30 centimeter inwards at some places and seven fuel cells were leaking oil, but the ship remained operational. On 9 July moved to the Lofjord close to Trondheim, escorted by the destroyers and , and the torpedo boats and . On 9 August, left for Germany in Operation Eiche, escorted by two torpedo boats. She arrived in Kiel on 20 August for repairs, which took until the end of October. On 9 November she moved to the Baltic Sea for see trials and artillery drill. On 8 December returned to Norway in Operation Prometheus, escorted by the destroyers , and , arriving in Narvik on the 12th. Five days later moved further North: in Operation Rudelsburg, escorted by the destroyers and she left for the Kåfjord joining there the cruisers , and . The Allies had paused the sailings of Arctic convoys in August. From October some merchants sailed independently to and from Murmansk and against this traffic Operation Aurora was planned: a sortie of into the Arctic. But in December the Arctic convoys resumed and the operation was not carried out.

===== Operation Regenbogen =====
On 30 December, , , and six destroyers left Narvik for Operation Regenbogen, an attack on convoy JW 51B, which was reported by German intelligence to be lightly escorted. Kummetz&#x27;s plan was to divide his force in half; he would take and three destroyers north of the convoy to attack it and draw away the escorts. and the remaining three destroyers would then attack the undefended convoy from the south. At 09:15 on the 31st, the British destroyer spotted the three destroyers screening for ; the Germans opened fire first. Three of the other four destroyers escorting the convoy rushed to join the fight, while laid a smoke screen to cover the convoy. Kummetz then turned back north to draw the destroyers away. Captain Robert Sherbrooke, the British escort commander, split his force: two destroyers were to stay with the convoy while he took the other two to pursue . Between 09:41 and 11:30 the cruiser attacked the escorts in several runs, sinking &quot;Achates&quot; and the minesweeper and heavily damaging the destroyer .

 meanwhile steamed toward the convoy from the south, and at 09:22 she saw some ships. Not able to identify the ships in the snow squalls and bad light at this latitude, she did not open fire until 11:42. The harsh conditions made accurate fire difficult; she ceased shooting by 12:03 without any hits. Only the freighter &quot;Calobre&quot; was damaged by splinters. Rear Admiral Robert Burnett&#x27;s Force R, centered on the cruisers and , standing by in distant support of the Allied convoy, raced to the scene. At 11:30 the cruisers engaged , which had been firing to port at the destroyer . Burnett&#x27;s ships approached from ″s starboard side and achieved complete surprise. The British cruisers scored three hits on and sank the destroyer . Following his orders not to risk the big ships even against inferior opponents, Kummetz ordered all ships to withdraw. inadvertently came alongside &quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Jamaica&quot;, and after identifying them as hostile, engaged them, though her fire remained inaccurate. The British cruisers turned toward and came under fire from both German cruisers. Burnett quickly decided to withdraw in the face of superior German firepower; his ships were armed with guns, while carried guns, and had 28 cm guns.

Hitler was furious over the failure to destroy the convoy, and ordered that all remaining German major warships be broken up for scrap. In protest, Raeder resigned; Hitler replaced him with Admiral Karl Dönitz, who persuaded Hitler to rescind the order to dismantle the surface ships of the . remained in Kafjord until 8 March, and moved to Bogen Bay on 9 March, where she was joined in March by the battleships and . All these ships moved to Altafjord on 22 March, where they were well positioned to attack Arctic convoys. This concentration of the German fleet prompted the Allies to again pause the Arctic convoys. The Germans now considered Operation Husar, (a repeat of Operation Wunderland) a sortie into the Kara Sea by . This operation relied heavily on air reconnaissance and since experience had shown that its single Ar 196 was not sufficient, during July 1943 trained refueling long-range reconnaissance BV 138 flying boats at sea in the Langfjorden. The operation was postponed on 14 July because of the simultaneous breakdown of all four diesel generators and was finally cancelled in August when a BV 138 operating out of a secret temporary base on the Northeast coast of Novaya Zemlya reported no traffic and heavy ice.

On 6 September the Germans launched Operation Zitronella: a raid by the German surface fleet on Svalbard but was left behind in Norway as her top speed was insufficient to cooperate with the other big ships. On 22 September the British executed Operation Source, in which they planned to attack , , and with ground mines laid by six X-class midget submarines. The attack on failed as its allocated attacking submarine was lost in transfer from the UK to the Norwegian coast. In the end only was heavily damaged by the ground mines of two submarines.

==== Operations in the Baltic ====
On 23 September, in Operation Hermelin left Altafjord for the Baltic escorted by the destroyers , , and . When the German force was detected on 26 September, the British tried to attack with a motor torpedo boat flotilla and thirty-nine Bristol Beaufighters and Grumman Tarpon torpedo bombers of 832 Naval Air Squadron. But because of bad weather and an unexpected course reversal of , the Germans were able to evade all attacks. When passing Kristiansand ran out of fuel and was replaced by . The cruiser arrived on 1 October in Gotenhafen, where on 9 October she survived a daylight attack by the Eighth Air Force without damage. underwent an overhaul in Libau, after which she remained in the Baltic Sea. In March 1944 became a training ship for Seekadetten. On 28 June was moved to the port of Utö in preparation of Operation Tanne West, a planned invasion of the Åland isles in case of a Finnish surrender, but the operation was cancelled on 8 July. In order to avoid heavy Russian air attacks, returned to Germany, but in September she returned to the entrance of the Gulf of Finland, covering the evacuation of troops and refugees over sea from Finland and Tallinn to the Baltic islands. To counter the threat of the Russian armored Ilyushin Il-2, the light anti-aircraft guns were reinforced with six 4 cm Bofors. 

In October the first Russian troops reached the Baltic in the Battle of Memel, as part of their Baltic offensive. On 11 October , the heavy cruiser , the destroyers , and , and the torpedo boats , , and bombarded Memel in support of the German defense of the port. hit twenty targets with four hundred 28 cm and two hundred and forty-five 15 cm shells while fired six hundred and seventy-three 20 cm shells. Three days later the operation was repeated. Returning from the operation, collided with and had to be repaired so only was available for a third operation on 22 October. During the Memel operations, the Ar 196 from and the two Ar 196 from were operated from the seaplane tender . The three Ar 196s were continuously in the air and it was too risky for the cruisers to stop to recover the floatplanes, since Russian submarines were operating in the area. The Ar 196s were used for artillery direction, spotting the fall of shot, anti-submarine patrol and even engaged Russian fighters and bombers. The Russians had also executed landings on the strategically important Baltic Island Ösel. The German army was retreating towards the peninsula of Sworbe on the island. On 23 and 24 October, bombarded Russian positions at Sworbe and thwarted the final Russian attack. The defenders held their bridgehead but one month later the Russians renewed their attacks. was called in again on 23 November but the German army evacuated the same day.

On 18 December was in Gotenhafen when No. 5 Group RAF executed a raid with 236 Avro Lancasters. Many ships were sunk in the harbor but although there were several near-misses was not hit. At the end of December the cruiser moved to Pillau, where in January two hundred survivors of the sinking of were embarked to replace the . In early February was again in action with Task Force Thiele: on 8 February four targets in Frauenburg and Elbing were bombarded in support of the German 4th Army against the advance made by the Russian 3rd Army and 48th Army. As the Soviet army advanced along the Baltic coast, evacuated on 6 March to Swinemünde. The cruiser did not enter the harbor but took up a position in the . There on 12 March she escaped a heavy daylight attack on the port of . On 23 March, the Russian East Pomeranian offensive reached the Baltic coast in Zoppot between Gotenhafen and Danzig. Between 23 March and 4 April, was continuously in action in the Gdańsk Bay, shelling Russian positions and warding off air attacks. A 17 cm Russian shell hit the conning tower but caused only minimal damage. On 3 April, the cruiser covered the evacuation of troops and refugees from Gotenhafen to Hela in Operation Walpurgisnacht,On 13 April 1945, thirty-four Lancaster bombers from 617 (&quot;Dambusters&quot;) squadron and No. 9 Squadron RAF launched an attack on and in . Some Lancasters carried 1000-pound bombs, others carried the super-heavy Tallboy bomb with which they had sunk in November 1944. The raid had to be aborted because of cloud cover over the targets. A second raid by twenty Lancasters of 617 squadron two days later failed again because of cloud cover. On 16 April, eighteen Lancasters from 617 squadron were more successful. Three 1000-pound bombs hit the ship. One bomb hit the bow and another fell close to the aft turret, but both were duds. Another bomb destroyed the range finder and all platforms on the battle mast. Seven Tallboys were dropped, one of which exploded between the ship and the shore and tore a one-by-ten meter hole in hull. was prevented from capsizing by her superstructure hitting the shore. Most of the lower decks were flooded but power could be partially restored and the list eliminated. The aft turret fell out but the fore turret could be made operational. Despite sinking, the water was shallow enough that her main deck was still above water, permitting her use as a stationary gun battery against advancing Soviet forces. She continued in this role until 4 May, by which time she had expended her main battery ammunition. Her crew rigged scuttling charges to destroy the hull but a fire caused the explosives to detonate prematurely. 

The fate of was long unclear, as with most of the ships seized by the Soviet Navy. According to the historians Erich Gröner and M. J. Whitley, the Soviet Navy raised the ship in September 1947 and broke her up for scrap in 1948–1949. The historians Hildebrand, Röhr and Steinmetz, in their book , state that she instead sank off Kolberg, claiming that the broken up in the late 1940s was instead the -class that had been sold to the Soviet Union in 1940. The historian Hans Georg Prager examined the Soviet archives in the early 2000s and discovered that had been sunk in weapons tests, in the Baltic Sea off Świnoujście in Poland (under German control and named during the war), on 22 July 1947.

In October 2020 an unexploded Tallboy bomb from the attack on was found in the Piast Canal ( during the war). After evacuating approximately 750 people who lived nearby, an attempt was undertaken to deflagrate it with a remote-controlled device, but it exploded without casualties.

<text>Jean Picard (21 July 1620 – 12 July 1682) was a French astronomer and priest born in La Flèche, where he studied at the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand.

He is principally notable for his accurate measure of the size of the Earth, based on a careful survey of one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian.

==Geodesy==
Picard was the first person to measure the size of the Earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy in an arc measurement survey conducted in 1669–70, for which he is honored with a pyramid at Juvisy-sur-Orge. Guided by Maurolycus&#x27;s methodology and Snellius&#x27;s mathematics for doing so, Picard achieved this by measuring one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using triangulation along thirteen triangles stretching from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens.

His measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. Isaac Newton was to use this value in his theory of universal gravitation.

The polar radius has now been measured at just over 6357 km. This was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value. This was another example of advances in astronomy and its tools making possible advances in cartography.

==Instruments==

Picard was the first to attach a telescope with crosswires (developed by William Gascoigne) to a quadrant, and one of the first to use a micrometer screw on his instruments. The quadrant he used to determine the size of the Earth had a radius of 38 inches and was graduated to quarter-minutes. The sextant he used to find the meridian had a radius of six feet, and was equipped with a micrometer to enable minute adjustments. These equipment improvements made the margin of error only ten seconds, as opposed to Tycho Brahe&#x27;s four minutes of error. This made his measurements 24 times as accurate.

==Other work==
In 1670–71, Picard travelled to the site of Tycho Brahe&#x27;s Danish observatory, Uraniborg, in order to assess its longitude accurately so that Tycho&#x27;s readings could be compared to others.

Picard collaborated and corresponded with many scientists, including Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens, Ole Rømer, Rasmus Bartholin, Johann Hudde, and even his main competitor, Giovanni Cassini, although Cassini was often less than willing to return the gesture. These correspondences led to Picard&#x27;s contributions to areas of science outside the field of geodesy, such as the aberration of light he observed while he was in Uraniborg, or his discovery of mercurial phosphorescence upon his observance of the faint glowing of a barometer. This discovery led to Newton&#x27;s studies of light&#x27;s visible spectrum.

Picard also developed what became the standard method for measuring the right ascension of a celestial object. In this method, the observer records the time at which the object crosses the observer&#x27;s meridian. Picard made his observations using the precision pendulum clock that Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens had recently developed.

==Legacy==
* His book &quot;Mesure de la Terre&quot; was published in 1671.
* There is a lunar crater named after Picard, on the southwest quadrant of Mare Crisium. 
* The PICARD mission, an orbiting solar observatory, is named after Picard.

<doc id="705037" wikidata="Q2554169" url="?curid=705037" title="Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>Richard Wilkins III (commonly referred to as The Mayor) is a fictional character in the fantasy television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). Portrayed by Harry Groener, he is the mayor of Sunnydale, a fictional town rife with vampires and demons in which the main character, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) lives. The premise of the series is that Buffy is a Slayer, a young girl endowed with superhuman powers to fight evil, which she accomplishes with the help of a small group of friends and family, called the Scooby Gang. During the show&#x27;s second season, it becomes apparent that local authorities are aware of the endemic evil in the town, and either ignore it or are complicit in making it worse. The third season reveals that the Mayor is behind this conspiracy to hide and worsen Sunnydale&#x27;s supernatural phenomena, as part of his century-long plot to take over the world, making him the season&#x27;s primary villain, or Big Bad. His genial demeanor, promotion of family values, casual phobia of germs, and dislike of swearing belie his evil nature. The series regularly employs monsters and elements of horror to symbolize real problems, and the abuse of power in relation to the forces of darkness is a repeated theme throughout the series, as well as in its spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;.

This season also marks Buffy&#x27;s and her friends&#x27; last year in high school, and introduces a long-running character named Faith (Eliza Dushku), who is also a Slayer. After many months of fighting alongside Buffy and being under the authority of Buffy&#x27;s Watcher, Giles, Faith becomes estranged from Buffy and aligns herself with the Mayor, who both employs her as an assassin and becomes a father figure to her while preparing to become a powerful demon that will destroy the town.

==Creation and casting==
In planning for the third season, series creator Joss Whedon and the team of writers for the show sought to explore the issues of the abuse of power, and the choices people in or with power make. Veteran stage actor Harry Groener was cast in the role of the Mayor of Sunnydale, the embodiment of a quintessential American politician. In the second season, it becomes clear that the authorities at Sunnydale High School — under which a portal to hell called a Hellmouth is situated — are aware of the perpetual influence of evil at the school and have been reporting events to the Mayor&#x27;s office. While there are scenes in season 2 which indicate that the Mayor is a fear-inspiring figure, he is not seen until the third season.

Series writer Jane Espenson credited Groener&#x27;s performance and his chemistry with co-star Eliza Dushku with propelling his character to greater importance and making their relationship a central focus of the season. The writers created the blue collar Slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) as an anti-Buffy: a young woman given extraordinary physical powers with no moral foundation. Whereas Buffy has had a stable family life up until her parents&#x27; divorce two years earlier, Faith does not know her father, and it is revealed that her mother was an alcoholic who beat Faith, before her death. She has been surviving on her own since her original Watcher, someone who teaches her about the demons and monsters she will face, was tortured and killed shortly before Faith&#x27;s arrival in Sunnydale.

Groener loved the part and was impressed with the writing. As a stage actor used to having rehearsal time to prepare for a role, he found himself often with little time for rehearsal in the environment of television production; actors sometimes get their lines the night before and must memorize them, then spend time on set learning how to block shots for cameras. Consequently, Groener said he did not have much time to rehearse and prepare for the role of the Mayor. He was surprised to see how involved Joss Whedon was in preparing scripts: sometimes Whedon would rewrite lines on set. Groener said, &quot;Poor Joss. Here is a man who I think never sleeps. He never, ever sleeps and of course he was writing and directing the last two episodes, and there were times when we would simply get a synopsis the night before...and while they&#x27;re setting everything up and getting everything ready to shoot the next scene, Joss is over in a corner writing the scene that&#x27;s going to happen after that. It can be kind of nuts! But it all gets done. That&#x27;s the magic of it.&quot;

==Establishment==
Wilkins is first alluded to in the second season&#x27;s third episode, &quot;School Hard&quot;, in a conversation between Principal Snyder and Police Chief Monroe, who agree to cover up the vampire attack which took place during the episode, and report the incident to the mayor. Similar conversations occurred between the two characters on a couple more instances throughout the season, most notably in episode 19, &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot;. The Mayor&#x27;s backstory is revealed throughout Season 3. Richard Wilkins III is also Richard Wilkins I and II; and he has been in office for over a century, pretending to be his own son in order to disguise his immortality, and maintaining his long life and political power by paying tribute to an array of demons who live in or under Sunnydale. He has been aware of Buffy&#x27;s presence in the town from the very beginning and has kept tabs on her through Sunnydale High School&#x27;s Principal Snyder (Armin Shimerman). Buffy and the rest of the town—except for a small group of his aides—are unaware of the Mayor&#x27;s dark nature.

The script for the third season&#x27;s fifth episode &quot;Homecoming&quot;, where audiences are first introduced to the mayor, describes him as a man who &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more unassuming ... one feels that this man has not raised his voice in years, and although he is mild enough in demeanor, one hopes he won&#x27;t.&quot; In the previous episode, Faith arrives in Sunnydale, as does a vampire named Mr. Trick (K. Todd Freeman), who tries to kill both Faith and Buffy. When this is unsuccessful, he attempts to kill both Slayers again—for fun—in &quot;Homecoming&quot;, billing it as &quot;Slayerfest&quot; and charging a fee to those who have come to hunt the two. Impressed with his initiative, the Mayor invites Mr. Trick to work for him. Mr. Trick&#x27;s first assignment is to distract the entire town so four infants can be taken from the hospital to serve as a sacrifice to a demon in &quot;Band Candy&quot;. Buffy and the Scooby Gang thwart the Mayor&#x27;s plans; their successful interference signals to the Mayor that Buffy&#x27;s efficiency as a fighter of evil will have long-ranging consequences for him. He tells Mr. Trick to keep an eye on her.

The Mayor carries out his evil schemes while exhibiting a paradoxical &quot;fifties sitcom-dad demeanor&quot;. He dislikes swearing and disallows its use in his presence. He asserts that he is a family man; a specifically conservative politician who espouses family values. Inside his office cabinet he keeps a variety of skulls, shrunken heads, weapons, and other evil objects alongside a box of hand wipes, which he uses frequently in between dispensing &quot;goofily prudish advice&quot; tainted with dark threats. His phobia of germs was an homage to &quot;Buffy&quot; producer David Greenwalt, who exhibits similar positive enthusiasm while often wiping his hands with wet towelettes. Groener&#x27;s acting was praised by author Nikki Stafford, who writes that he &quot;is consistently wonderful in this role, one that would have been very difficult for many actors to maintain&quot;. Likewise, Jane Espenson remarked that Groener played the part exhibiting a &quot;wonderful innocent glee&quot; towards evil that she thought was &quot;delightful&quot;. Groener stated that when he tried to play the Mayor too dark or evil, Joss Whedon or other directors would ask him to tone it down, take it easy and make the part &quot;real nice&quot;. In contrast to the series&#x27; previous villains and monsters, the Mayor&#x27;s evil hides behind a mask of humanity. Groener enjoyed this, saying &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be Snidely Whiplash to be evil. Look at Ted Bundy.&quot; The Mayor&#x27;s unassuming appearance, pleasure in such harmless activities as miniature golf and reading &quot;The Family Circus&quot;, and his quirky mysophobia are a part of the season&#x27;s exploration of moral ambiguity.

==Conflict with Buffy and relationship with Faith==
During the episodes which reveal the Mayor&#x27;s true nature, Faith&#x27;s darker nature also begins to appear. She shows herself to be purely motivated by pleasure, even enjoying to excess her fighting as a Slayer, but unreliable regarding the duties associated with that role. Her character tests ethics more than any other on the series, highlighting the repeated theme of the role of free will in the struggle between good and evil. Her reaction to killing demons and vampires is &quot;positively joyful&quot; contrasting with Buffy&#x27;s frequent admissions that she considers her responsibilities an imposition on her life—although she is committed to her duty. In the early part of the season, Faith&#x27;s actions aid the cause of good, but her motivations are ambiguous. She never reveals, other than the pleasure she receives, why she fights evil.

Faith, Buffy, and the Mayor come into conflict during &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, an episode in which Buffy allows herself to break rules and ignore responsibility. Needing to distract the Slayers so that he can be assured of the privacy required to complete an important ritual, the Mayor ensures they learn of a cult of vampires loyal to a demon named Balthazar, knowing they will be fully engaged in defeating him, giving the Mayor time to enact a ritual required as part of his preparation to become a demon (referred to as his Ascension). Its outcome is his invulnerability for the next 100 days, illustrated when he allows one of Balthazar&#x27;s minions to slice his head in two so it can mend itself.

In their efforts to track and defeat Balthazar and his cohorts, Buffy and Faith flirt with lawlessness, breaking into a store and stealing weapons, then escaping police custody to complete their mission. The Deputy Mayor, who has begun to show a reluctance to participate in the Mayor&#x27;s plans and is keeping track of the Slayers, follows them to warn them of Mr. Trick and the Mayor&#x27;s intention to have them killed. In the heat of fighting, Faith accidentally stakes and kills the Deputy Mayor, believing him to be a vampire. While Buffy feels terrible guilt for being a part of the Deputy Mayor&#x27;s death, Faith claims not to, and resents Buffy for continuing to speak of it in &quot;Consequences&quot;. Faith tells Buffy&#x27;s Watcher Giles (Anthony Head) that it was Buffy who killed the Deputy Mayor; he does not believe her and she is taken into custody to be dealt with by the Watchers&#x27; Council. She escapes and tries to leave town, only to be stopped by Buffy. Mr. Trick appears on the scene to try to kill them both, and Faith saves Buffy by killing Mr. Trick. She then goes to the Mayor&#x27;s office and offers him her services, but continues to pretend to be fighting on Buffy&#x27;s side. Eventually her alliance with the Mayor is exposed and she is revealed as Buffy&#x27;s enemy.

The Mayor puts Faith up in a large, fully furnished apartment, buys her clothes, a video game system, and an expensive knife. He nurtures her, giving her a sense of belonging after her rift with the Scoobies, asking only in return she kill people when required. Faith has no problem with this arrangement and enjoys the lifestyle. &quot;Buffy&quot; writer Marti Noxon states that villains who seek out love and social connections to counter their loneliness are complex and interesting to write. The Mayor shows absolute confidence in Faith&#x27;s abilities and she in turn is validated by him. Among the characters who know them both, the Mayor is the only one who never compares Faith to Buffy. When Faith calls him her &quot;sugar daddy&quot;, he gently scolds her, reminding her that he is a &quot;family man&quot;. According to author Lorna Jowett, his rejection of any sexual element in their relationship makes their bond stronger. Faith&#x27;s experience with sex has left her apathetic about her partners, but when the Mayor demands loyalty, she is able to give it. His affection for Faith is genuine; like Faith, he has no living family, his wife having died of old age. The Mayor, according to Harry Groener, is a lonely father figure who &quot;loves unconditionally&quot;. In series writer Doug Petrie&#x27;s opinion, the Mayor is well-matched to Faith, who Petrie sees as &quot;the loneliest person in Sunnydale&quot; who &quot;desperately needs a father&quot;. Eliza Dushku states that one of Faith&#x27;s major life battles is constructing a viable self-esteem, which the Mayor never challenges, but his evil amplifies the &quot;crazy&quot; aspect of her nature. Whedon declared Faith the writing team&#x27;s first &quot;really human monster&quot;. The Mayor intends Faith to inherit his evil empire, and shows unabashed pride in her achievements. Their tenderness with each other, according to Whedon, is a &quot;beautiful counterpoint&quot; to the violence and evil they wreak on the town.

==Demise==
The Mayor plans his Ascension to demon form to coincide with Sunnydale High School&#x27;s graduation day. In &quot;Choices&quot;, the Mayor must complete another ritual involving a box full of grotesquely large insects which will, after he ingests them, imbue him with greater power. Faith retrieves the box for him, which Buffy then steals in order to prevent this important ritual from occurring. In the process, Buffy&#x27;s best friend Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) is captured by Faith, and the Mayor meets Buffy for the first time when they exchange Willow for the box. During the confrontation, the Mayor pointedly asks questions about the viability of Buffy&#x27;s relationship with Angel (David Boreanaz), a vampire who has been re-ensouled and who fights alongside Buffy. Although Buffy and Angel have been trying to avoid acknowledging the difficulties involved with continuing a relationship that can make neither of them happy, the Mayor&#x27;s fatherly questions about their future and his comparison to his own experience of watching his wife Edna Mae die at an old age while he remained youthful, becomes a factor which forces them to admit that the relationship should end.

Buffy and Angel mutually but sadly concede they cannot be happy together in the next episode but they continue to work toward the goal of defeating the Mayor&#x27;s plan. The two-part season finale &quot;Graduation Day&quot; reveals that the Mayor will be the keynote speaker at Sunnydale High&#x27;s commencement ceremony, where he will be able to feed on the students after his transformation. On orders from the Mayor, Faith murders a geologist who has uncovered evidence of a previously ascended demon, then shoots Angel with a poisoned arrow to distract Buffy and the Scoobies, who have to care for, and try to save, Angel. When they learn that the only antidote to the poison is the blood of a Slayer, Buffy tries to capture Faith in order to use her blood to cure Angel. During the fight to do so, Buffy stabs Faith with the knife given to her by the Mayor; Faith escapes, but her injuries put her into the hospital, comatose. Buffy then offers her own blood to Angel, who feeds on her, then takes her to the hospital after he recovers. There, the Mayor is poignantly grieving for Faith. He discovers Buffy in the next room and tries to smother her, but is stopped by Angel.

In a redemptive turn, Faith comes to Buffy in a dream to tell her how to defeat the Mayor, saying &quot;Want to know the deal? Human weakness. It never goes away. Even his.&quot; The knife the Mayor gave to Faith then flashes in the palm of Buffy&#x27;s hand. A fully recovered Buffy and the Scoobies enlist the graduating students of Sunnydale High, outfitting them with weapons to attack immediately after the Mayor&#x27;s transformation, after learning his invulnerability will end once he is in demon form. The Mayor gives a speech about changes, growing up and moving on, mirroring the loose ends created by the series and the season. A solar eclipse occurs during his speech, signaling the start of the Ascension. He transforms into an enormous snake-like demon, and devours the universally loathed Principal Snyder when the latter admonished him for disrupting the event. While Angel and the Scoobies fight the Mayor&#x27;s force of vampires, Buffy taunts the now-transformed Mayor with Faith&#x27;s knife and runs into the school. The Mayor follows her to the library, which is rigged with explosives, killing him and destroying the school with a series of explosions.

== Influence ==
Author Lorna Jowett considers the Mayor a classic villain, similar to the first season&#x27;s vampire Master. Although the Mayor&#x27;s appearance is not as frightening as the Master&#x27;s, both are heads of hierarchies and symbols of patriarchy whose names are their titles. Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox calls the Mayor — particularly after his transformation — &quot;Mr. Patriarchal Phallus of 1999&quot;. Faith&#x27;s relationship to the Mayor in many ways mirrors Buffy&#x27;s relationship to her Watcher, Giles, who is Buffy&#x27;s father figure. Doug Petrie characterizes Faith as &quot;Buffy&#x27;s evil twin&quot;, who gets to do what Buffy would like to do, but cannot because Buffy is moral and not as &quot;free-spirited&quot; as Faith, according to Whedon. Through the Mayor&#x27;s effort to nurture his relationship with Faith she becomes his subordinate, despite her assertions to Buffy that she is independent. Her motivation to kill the geologist is never more complicated than, &quot;The boss wants you dead&quot;, which she tells him just before stabbing him to death. Unlike Giles&#x27; mentoring of Buffy, in which he encourages her to make her own decisions despite what she is ordered to do by the similarly patriarchal Watcher&#x27;s Council, Faith complies with everything the Mayor wants, creating &quot;unquestioning service of the power structure for the sake of approval, comfort, and support of the father&quot;. In contrast, Buffy soon stops taking orders from the Watchers&#x27; Council. Jowett writes, &quot;The Mayor is ultimately a &#x27;bad&#x27; father because he holds the status quo: like the Master before him, he is a powerful patriarch who wants to maintain his position at the top, and the children of such parents will never be able to grow up.&quot;

Faith does not die from her injuries, but returns in the fourth season in &quot;This Year&#x27;s Girl&quot;. While still in her coma, she dreams of a pleasant picnic with the Mayor, who picks up a small snake that has slithered onto the blanket and tells it that it does not belong there. The dream-picnic is interrupted by Buffy who stabs him to death. Faith awakens in the hospital to discover that the Mayor has in fact died and left her a video and a device that will allow her to switch bodies with Buffy. After Buffy recovers her own body, Faith goes to Angel in Los Angeles, turns herself in to the police and goes to prison, later emerging to begin her redemption on &quot;Angel&quot;. She returns to Sunnydale in season 7, not only to help Buffy and the Scoobies, but to perform in a position of leadership. In season 7 the Mayor also returns as one of the faces of the First Evil in &quot;Lessons&quot; and &quot;Touched&quot;.

<text>Maury Island is a tied island in Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. It is connected to Vashon Island by an isthmus built by local homeowners in 1913. Before construction of the isthmus, the island was connected to Vashon only during low tide. The island is rural with large areas of farmland, forest, and relatively undeveloped shoreline. Currently, environmental issues on the island are under considerable scrutiny.

Maury Island was named in 1841 during the Wilkes Expedition in honor of William Lewis Maury, who between 1863 and 1864 raided Union ships on behalf of the Confederacy and is buried in Caroline County, Virginia. It was the site of the Maury Island incident, a case of an alleged encounter with a UFO.

Point Robinson Light is located on Point Robinson, the easternmost point on Maury Island. Dockton was once the site of a dry dock as well as a salmon cannery.

Maury and Vashon Islands are home to the &quot;Vashon-Maury Island Community Council&quot;. In the 1940s, Vashon had a chamber of commerce that acted more like a community council than a traditional chamber. By the 1950s, the precursor to today&#x27;s community council was organized and called itself the &quot;Civic Assembly.&quot; Today, the Community Council is charged with working to preserve the rural nature of Vashon and Maury Islands.

Maury Island was also the center of controversy between the locals and Glacier Northwest, a company that supplies ready-mixed concrete owned by the Taiheiyo Cement Company of Japan. The company intended a 300-fold expansion of their existing gravel mine on the island, which was previously permitted to extract up to 20,000 tons per year. With the expansion, the company would have gained the capability to extract up to 40,000 tons per day. The opposition group made up of local islanders was known as Preserve Our Islands and staunchly advocated gathering more information before continuing mining operations on the island. The affected shoreline is located within the state&#x27;s only existing aquatic preserve for notably diverse marine ecosystems. Opponents of the mine disputed many of the claims made by Glacier Northwest and alleged that the project will severely impact sensitive shoreline habitat . On December 30, 2010, King County bought the property and took possession of the land, including the keys to the property gate. The council adopted King County Executive Dow Constantine&#x27;s proposed purchase and sale of the property on December 6, including the adoption of his financing package. The King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks will now work with the community to improve the property for public open space, while restoring the ecological habitat for wildlife. The mile of shoreline that is part of the purchase is the longest undeveloped stretch of shore in King County, and will be a critical part of the region&#x27;s wildlife habitat for fish, birds and Puget Sound marine life.

<text>Arthur Stanley Wint OD MBE (25 May 1920 – 19 October 1992) was a Jamaican Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot during the Second World War, sprinter, physician, and later High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Competing at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics, whilst a medical student at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, London, he won two gold and two silver medals, becoming the first Jamaican Olympic gold medalist.

==Biography==
Arthur Wint, known as the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot;, was born in Plowden, Manchester, Jamaica. While at Calabar High School, he ran sprints and did both the high jump and long jump. He later transferred to Excelsior High School, where he finished his secondary education. In 1937 he was the Jamaica Boy Athlete of the year, and the following year won a gold medal in the 800 metres at the Central American Games in Panama.

In 1942 he joined the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and set the Canadian 400-metre record while training there. He was sent to Britain for active combat during World War II as a pilot. He left the Royal Air Force in 1947 to study medicine at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, through the British further education and vocational training scheme for ex-servicemen.

In the 1948 London Games, Wint won Jamaica&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal for the 400 metres (46.2 seconds), beating his team-mate Herb McKenley. In the 800 metres he won silver, after American Mal Whitfield&#x27;s gold. Wint missed a probable third medal when he pulled a muscle in the 4 × 400 metres relay final.

In Helsinki in 1952 he was part of the historic team setting the world record while capturing the gold in the 4 × 400 metres relay. He also won silver in the 800 metres, again coming second to Mal Whitfield.

Wint ran his final race in 1953 at Wembley Stadium, finished his internship, and graduated as a doctor. The following year he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1954 New Year Honours. In 1955 Wint returned to Jamaica, eventually settling in Hanover as the only resident doctor in the parish. In 1973 he was awarded the Jamaica honour of the Order of Distinction. He served as Jamaica&#x27;s High Commissioner to Britain and ambassador to Sweden and Denmark from 1974 to 1978. He was inducted in the Black Athlete&#x27;s Hall of Fame in the US (1977), the Jamaica Sports Hall of Fame (1989) and the Central American &amp; Caribbean Athletic Confederation Hall of Fame (2003).

==Death and legacy==
Wint died on Heroes Day in Linstead, aged 72. His funeral was attended by hundreds of people, including the Jamaican Prime Minister. In 2012, a Blue Heritage Plaque was unveiled at 22 Philbeach Gardens in Earls Court, London, where he lived while studying medicine. At the same event, his daughter launched her book about him, titled &quot;The Longer Run&quot;.

<doc id="705045" wikidata="Q1983282" url="?curid=705045" title="J. Pat O'Malley">
<text>James Rudolph O&#x27;Malley (15 March 1904 – 27 February 1985) was an English actor and singer who appeared in many American films and television programmes from the 1940s to 1982, using the stage name J. Pat O&#x27;Malley. He also appeared on the Broadway stage in &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; (1944) and &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; drama critic Theodore Goldsmith praised O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s performance in &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, calling him &quot;a rara avis, a comedian who does not gauge the success of his efforts by the number of laughs he induces at each performance&quot;.

==Career==
===Early years===
Born into an Irish family in Burnley, Lancashire, O’Malley sang with Jack Hylton and his orchestra in the United Kingdom from 1930 to 1935. Known at that time as Pat O&#x27;Malley, in 1930 he sang &quot;Amy, Wonderful Amy&quot;, a song about aviator Amy Johnson, performed by Jack Hylton&#x27;s band.

At the end of 1935, Hylton and O&#x27;Malley came to the United States to record with a band composed of American musicians, thus emulating Ray Noble and Al Bowlly. The venture was short-lived. O&#x27;Malley remained in the US, known professionally as J. Pat O&#x27;Malley (to avoid confusion with another film actor named Pat O&#x27;Malley); he had a long and varied acting career, including the 1943 film &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot; as &quot;Hynes&quot;.

===Television career===

O&#x27;Malley guest-starred in 1951 as a sheriff on the syndicated western series, &quot;The Adventures of Kit Carson&quot;. From 1950 to 1955, he appeared in five episodes of &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;. From 1951 to 1957, he was cast in eight episodes of another anthology series, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;. Other television work from this period includes roles in &quot;Spin and Marty&quot; film (1955) and serial (1955–57) as the always-faithful ranch steward, Perkins.

In 1956, O&#x27;Malley guest-starred in &quot;The Guilty&quot;, one of the last episodes of the NBC legal drama &quot;Justice.&quot; In 1958, he was a guest star in &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; (Season 1, Episode 3, &quot;The Vicious Dog&quot;) as Homer Tweed.

O&#x27;Malley also appeared in the syndicated &quot;City Detective&quot; in the episode &quot;Found in a Pawnshop&quot; (1955).

<doc id="705052" wikidata="Q5057071" url="?curid=705052" title="Cedric Belfrage">
<text>Cedric Henning Belfrage (8 November 1904 – 21 June 1990) was an English film critic, journalist, writer and political activist. He is best remembered as a co-founder of the radical US weekly &quot;National Guardian&quot;. Later Belfrage was referenced as a Soviet agent in the US intelligence Venona project, although it appears he had been working for British Security Co-ordination as a double agent.

==Early years==
Cedric Henning Belfrage was born in Marylebone, London, on 8 November 1904, the son of Sydney Henning Belfrage and Frances Grace (née Powley). He was educated at Gresham&#x27;s School, before entering Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. There he had the same room as Christopher Marlowe had in the 16th century.

While still a Cambridge student, Belfrage began a writing career as a film critic, with a first article in &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; in 1924. In 1927 he went to Hollywood, where he was hired by the &quot;New York Sun&quot; and &quot;Film Weekly&quot; as a correspondent. Belfrage returned to London in 1930 as Sam Goldwyn&#x27;s press agent. Returning to Hollywood, he became politically active, joining the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and co-editing a left-wing literary magazine called &quot;The Clipper&quot;. He decided to make the United States his home and took out first papers for citizenship in 1937, although he failed to complete the process within the statutory seven-year time limit.

Belfrage joined the Communist Party USA in 1937, but withdrew his membership a few months later. Thereafter, he maintained a friendly but critical relationship as a so-called &quot;fellow traveler&quot; outside party membership and discipline, recalling in his 1978 memoir that for &quot;temperamentally argumentative&quot; adherents of socialism such as himself, such status as a &quot;non-Communist, non-anti-Communist... suited us better.&quot; Despite his non-membership in the American Communist Party, Belfrage remained a believer that it functioned as &quot;the core of the radical movement.&quot;

==Second World War==
During the Second World War, Belfrage worked in the British Security Coordination for the Western hemisphere. After the fall of Nazi Germany, he was appointed as a &quot;press control officer&quot; in the Anglo-American Psychological Warfare Division and was dispatched to Germany to help reorganize that nation&#x27;s newspapers. He and his associates requisitioned buildings, equipment, and supplies for a new &quot;democratic&quot; German press and oversaw a purge of Nazi collaborators from the new German newspaper industry.

It was while Belfrage was in Frankfurt working to establish the &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot; – a new daily – that he met James Aronson, a veteran newspaper reporter and editor from Boston who shared Belfrage&#x27;s radical politics. Aronson was attached to Belfrage and together the pair helped to establish new newspapers in Heidelberg, Kassel, Stuttgart, and Bremen, developing a friendship and forging vague plans to launch a new radical newspaper in the United States following the end of the war.

Belfrage was soon discharged from the Army and returned to the United States, however, and nothing immediately came of the pair&#x27;s plans. Aronson returned to a job with the then-liberal &quot;New York Post&quot; in April 1946, moving later that year to a new job with &quot;The New York Times.&quot;

==&quot;National Guardian&quot;==
In 1948, Belfrage co-founded, together with James Aronson and John T. McManus, a radical weekly newspaper called the &quot;National Guardian&quot;. He would remain affiliated with the publication – renamed &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1967 – until late in the 1960s.

==Later years==
At the height of McCarthyism, Belfrage was summoned in 1953 to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In 1955, he was deported back to England. His wife, Molly Castle, had already been deported by that time. He travelled to Cuba in 1961. In 1962, he travelled throughout South America, finally settling in Cuernavaca, Mexico.

Belfrage returned to the US for the first time in 1973, touring around the country with to promote his new book, &quot;The American Inquisition&quot;. He later debuted as a Spanish-English translator, notably for the Latin American author Eduardo Galeano. He was commissioned by &quot;Monthly Review Press&quot; to translate Galeano&#x27;s &quot;Open Veins of Latin America&quot;. Belfrage continued to write extensively until his last years.

==Intelligence allegations==
According to FBI files, Belfrage was questioned by the FBI in 1947 about his involvement with the Communist Party. The interview covered his relations with CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder, Jacob Golos, V. J. Jerome, and surveillances and documents about Scotland Yard and the Vichy Government of France. In her 1951 memoir &quot;Out of Bondage&quot;, Elizabeth Bentley (who had reported to Golos) recounted Belfrage&#x27;s interactions with Golos.

In 1995, intercepts decrypted by Venona – a project between the US and British intelligence services to decipher Soviet messages – were made public. United States intelligence has alleged that Unnamed Codename Number 9 (UNC/9) was Belfrage. Venona also had a cover name &quot;Charlie&quot; that was not identified by the FBI.

The 1948 &quot;Gorsky Memo&quot;, found in Soviet Archives, identifies Belfrage as having a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence as a member of the &quot;Sound&quot; and &quot;Myrna&quot; groups. Seven Venona decrypts reference UNC/9 in passing conversations between Belfrage&#x27;s bureau chief and Winston Churchill on to the Soviets. During the period in question, the United States and the Soviet Union were wartime allies while at the same time the Soviet Union maintained a spy network of American citizens who passed US secrets to the Soviets.

==Personal life==
He and his wife, Molly Castle, had two children; Sally and Nicolas. He also had a child, Anne Hertz (Zribi), with partner Anne-Marie Hertz. Cedric was the younger brother of actor and BBC newsreader Bruce Belfrage (1900–1974). Cedric&#x27;s uncle was Bryan Powley, the actor who began his career in the era of Silent film.

==Death==
Cedric Belfrage died on 21 June 1990 in Mexico, aged 85.

==Present-day allegations==
In August 2015, Christopher Andrew, professor of modern history at Cambridge and official historian of MI5 accessed documents released from the UK National Archive which confirmed that Belfrage worked for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) during the war and also spied for the Soviet Union. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; described Belfrage as &quot;a &#x27;sixth man&#x27; to stand alongside the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring.&quot; Other UK print, TV and radio media carried the story.

On 17 September 2015 a BBC Radio Four documentary &quot;The Hollywood Spy&quot; examined Christopher Andrew&#x27;s allegations, but also put forward information by historian John Simkin that Belfrage was working for British Security Co-ordination as a double-agent, which would explain why he handed information to the Soviets.

<doc id="705053" wikidata="Q1644435" url="?curid=705053" title="Treaty of Easton">
<text>The Treaty of Easton was a colonial agreement in North America signed in October 1758 during the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) between British colonials and the chiefs of 13 Native American nations, representing tribes of the Iroquois, Lenape (Delaware), and Shawnee. Negotiations over more than a week were concluded on October 26, 1758, at a ceremony held in Easton, Pennsylvania between the British colonial governors of the provinces of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and representatives of 13 Indian nations, including the Iroquois, who sent chiefs of three of their nations to ensure their continued domination of their Ohio Country region; the eastern and western Lenape (Delaware), represented by two chiefs and headmen; Shawnee and others. More than 500 Native Americans attended the outdoor ceremony, after lengthy negotiations to bring peace to the regions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and the Ohio Country.

Conrad Weiser served as an interpreter and arbitrator for the British colonial governments. Charles Thomson served as secretary and advisor to Teedyuscung, who was referred to as &quot;King of the Delawares&quot;. The negotiations were held to hopefully resolve conflicts created by The Walking Purchase of 1737, which had lasting effects on the relationships between the Native Americans and the colonists. Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Benjamin Chew, Esq. attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Easton and documented the proceedings in his &quot;Journal of a Journey to Easton&quot;. Charles Thomson also wrote about the Easton treaty negotiations in 1759 in a work entitled &quot;An Enquiry into the Causes of the Alienation of the Delaware and Shawanese Indians from the British Interest&quot;, which blamed the war on the proprietors (i.e. the sons of William Penn).

The treaty specified that the Native American nations would not fight on the side of the French against the British in the current war. In return, Pennsylvania returned large blocks of land which the Iroquois had ceded a few years before; the British colonial governors promised to recognize Iroquois and other tribes&#x27; rights to their hunting grounds in the Ohio River valley; and to refrain from establishing colonial settlements west of the Allegheny Mountains after the conclusion of the war. This clause of the treaty contributed to the Crown&#x27;s subsequent Proclamation of 1763, by which it attempted to reserve territory west of the Appalachians for Native Americans and prohibit European-American advancement into the area. In addition, colonial governor William Denny of Pennsylvania agreed to negotiate directly with the Lenape-Delaware again without Iroquois intervention and marked the agreement by rekindling a &quot;council fire.&quot; The conference concluded on October 26, 1758, and in November, Governor Denny announced to the Pennsylvania Assembly that &quot;a general peace was secured at Easton.&quot;

By the treaty, the Lenape ceded all remaining claims to land within the Province of New Jersey for the sum of one thousand Spanish dollars. They received payment immediately.

<doc id="705056" wikidata="Q5346696" url="?curid=705056" title="Edwin Newman">
<text>Edwin Harold Newman (January 25, 1919 – August 13, 2010) was an American newscaster, journalist, and author. After beginning his career with the wire services and serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Newman worked in radio for CBS News. He is known for a 23-year career with NBC News, from 1961 to 1984.

==Early life and education==
Newman was born on January 25, 1919, in New York City to Myron, a credit manager, and Rose (née Parker) Newman. His older brother was M.W. Newman, a longtime reporter for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. His grandparents were all Russian-Jewish immigrants. Newman married Rigel Grell (1923–2020) on August 14, 1944. They had one daughter, Nancy, who was born on October 6, 1945, and who married the political scientist and university fund-raiser Henry Drucker (1942–2002) in 1975. Nancy died in Oxford on December 8, 2020, aged 75.

After graduating from George Washington High School Newman attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison, serving on the staff of &quot;The Daily Cardinal&quot; and earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science in 1940. He briefly did postgraduate work in American government at Louisiana State University before becoming a journalist.

==Career==

===1940s===
Newman initially worked for the wire services: first for the International News Service as a copy boy, mostly in the Senate, and then United Press. On Sunday, December 7, 1941, the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, he heard the news during a radio concert. When he rang the office asking if he should come in, the reply was &quot;Hell yes!&quot; Newman took dictation for 12 hours as United Press reporters phoned in their stories.

He served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945 as a signal officer, stationed first in Trinidad and then at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Following the war Newman worked as a reporter for United Press (1945–1946, primarily reporting about the State Department), before moving to the CBS News radio division (1947–1949) as assistant to Eric Sevareid.

===1950s===
Between 1949 and 1952 Newman worked as a freelancer, primarily for NBC News. He wrote for a number of publications and, in 1951, worked for the Marshall Plan in Greece. In 1952, Newman began to work full-time for NBC. He covered significant stories: the 1952 funeral of King George VI from the freezing battlements of Windsor Castle; Britain&#x27;s emergence as a nuclear power; and the 1956 Suez Crisis. At the same time, Newman enjoyed quirky stories; he once climbed a tree in Kensington Gardens dressed in a hunting outfit (complete with deerstalker hat and whistle) to investigate a report that ducks were nesting in trees.

Newman was an NBC bureau chief, first in Rome and then in Paris. In both assignments, diplomatic and political news (such as the twists and turns of the Cold War and the increasingly divisive anti-colonial Algerian War) vied with stories elsewhere in Europe and beyond. Newman covered the accession to power of President Charles de Gaulle in 1958. He was decorated as Chevalier of the Legion of Honour for his coverage of de Gaulle&#x27;s funeral in 1970 and for improving the understanding of France in the United States.

===1961–1984: NBC News===

Between 1961 and 1984, Newman participated in a wide variety of NBC programs, primarily for NBC News. He was a regular on the &quot;Today&quot; show and was its news anchor from July 24 to December 22, 1961, then a contributor and guest host. On &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, he was a frequent panelist and moderator.

From 1960 to 1984 Newman played a central role in NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Republican and Democratic national conventions, when gavel-to-gavel coverage was the norm. In 1964 and 1968, he, John Chancellor, Frank McGee, and Sander Vanocur (dubbed &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;) were fitted with state-of-the-art backpacks enabling them to roam the convention floor and conduct live interviews with delegates.

Newman specialized in reporting breaking news. In 1963, he made the first announcement on NBC Radio of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s death. He anchored the television coverage of the 1967 Six-Day Arab-Israeli War, the 1968 assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and the 1973 Vietnam ceasefire. In 1981, immediately after the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, he was chosen to anchor NBC&#x27;s television coverage until full news teams were mustered.

Newman was the only radio journalist to interview Emperor Hirohito (Emperor Shōwa) of Japan. The interview took place in September 1975 at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, shortly before Hirohito&#x27;s diplomatically delicate visit to the United States. For his program &quot;Speaking Freely&quot;, he conducted more than 250 hour-long interviews with leading figures of the day between 1967 and 1976. Among interviewees were director Ingmar Bergman, zoologist Konrad Lorenz, classical guitarist Andrés Segovia, founder of Transcendental Meditation Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, boxer Muhammad Ali, and the first and fourth prime ministers of Israel, David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir. The series was broadcast on Sunday mornings by local New York station WNBC, and syndicated to other stations.

Newman moderated two presidential debates, both of which demanded the calm and courtesy for which he was known. The 1976 debate, between incumbent Gerald Ford and Georgia governor Jimmy Carter, was the first presidential debate since 1960 and was marred by a 27-minute loss of audio (during which the candidates stood silently by their lecterns). In 1984, President Ronald Reagan faced former Vice President Walter Mondale; when Reagan overran the time limit for his closing statement, Newman was obliged to cut off Reagan&#x27;s remarks.

Newman participated in a number of documentaries at NBC, including &quot;Japan: East is West&quot; (1961); &quot;Who Shall Live?&quot; (about kidney dialysis, 1965); &quot;Pensions: The Broken Promise&quot; (1972); &quot;Violence in America&quot; (1977); &quot;Land of Hype and Glory&quot; (1977); &quot;Spying for Uncle Sam&quot; (1978); &quot;Reading, Writing and Reefer&quot; (1978); &quot;Oil and American Power&quot; (1979); and &quot;The Billionaire Hunts&quot; (1981).

===Other work===
Newman enjoyed music and hosted summer Boston Symphony concerts from Tanglewood. He contributed to the work of the Religious Affairs Unit at NBC, and was a Broadway drama critic from 1965 to 1971. As a baseball and boxing aficionado from childhood, he also enjoyed sports broadcasting. He provided in-studio news updates in 1980, during the short-lived morning version of &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;. Newman also showed his singing voice and hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, becoming the first network news anchor to host (despite claims that Brian Williams is, though Williams is the first network news anchor to host a Lorne Michaels–produced episode). He also wrote a book called &quot;Strictly Speaking&quot; in 1974.

===1984 and beyond===
After leaving NBC in January 1984 Newman was in demand as an interviewer, narrator, and moderator, participating in many programs on PBS and cable networks. One series to which he was particularly committed was &quot;Congress: We the People&quot;. Beginning in 1983 Newman moderated annual televised conferences of former Secretaries of State, and conducted a series of interviews with Dean Rusk (US Secretary of State, 1961–69) for the Southern Center for International Studies in Atlanta, Georgia. He narrated a series of programs about the restoration of Michelangelo&#x27;s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. In 1988 he hosted and narrated an eight-part PBS documentary on the technical and social history of television, produced by PBS affiliates KCET and WNET. He was in demand to play himself in films and on television. Among his film credits were &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, &quot;Spies Like Us&quot;, and &quot;My Fellow Americans&quot;; television appearances included episodes of &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Wings&quot;, and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. He lectured extensively on the English language and the news business. 

In 1990, he was a narrator for an Audio Renaissance dramatization of Ernest Callenbach&#x27;s utopian novel &quot;Ecotopia&quot;, reading the news reports of William Weston as he tours the breakaway republic.

==Final years==
Newman spent his final years quietly, moving with his wife to England in 2007 to be nearer their daughter. He died of pneumonia in Oxford on August 13, 2010. The public announcement of his death was delayed for a little over a month (until September 15), to allow a period of private mourning for his family. Newman was survived by his wife and daughter. Rigel Newman died in May 2020, shortly followed by their daughter in December 2020 aged 75, following years of ill health.

==Humor and publications==
Newman had a blend of seriousness and humor. For a 1964 documentary he traveled from Paris on the Orient Express, talking to people along the way and ending up in a bubble bath in Istanbul. Newman enjoyed puns: when he worked on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, his doggerel poem reviewing each year&#x27;s events would end &quot;Happy Noo Year to Yoose from Edwin Newman NBC Noose&quot;. On several occasions, he placed a whoopie cushion on the chair of Roger Mudd, Washington correspondent for NBC News. Around the time Newman left NBC in 1984, he twice hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; on one occasion, to the delight of the audience, he sang &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Talk About Me When I&#x27;m Gone&quot; as part of the opening monologue. On both occasions, as well as for a third special guest appearance on the show later in the season, he hosted the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; faux newscast. Newman also briefly anchored a faux newscast based on the tabloid newspaper &quot;Weekly World News&quot; for the USA Network in 1996.

In 1974 Newman&#x27;s first book, &quot;Strictly Speaking: Will America be the Death of English?&quot; reached #1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; nonfiction bestseller list. &quot;A Civil Tongue&quot; followed in 1976, &quot;Sunday Punch&quot; (a comic novel) in 1979, and &quot;I Must Say&quot; in 1988. The latter (a collection of his syndicated columns for King Features) ranged over U.S. politics and foreign policy, his journalistic assignments, and the state of the English language. Newman served for a number of years as chairman of the usage panel at Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s American Heritage Dictionary.

<doc id="705058" wikidata="Q3149892" url="?curid=705058" title="Maury Island incident">
<text>The Maury Island incident refers to claims made by Fred Crisman and Harold Dahl of falling debris and threats by men in black following sightings of unidentified flying objects in the sky over Maury Island, Washington, United States. The pair claimed that the events had occurred on June 21, 1947. The incident is widely regarded as a hoax, even by believers of flying saucers and UFOs.

On August 1, two Air Force officers tasked with investigating the incident were killed when their plane crashed outside of Kelso, Washington. Project Blue Book chief Edward J. Ruppelt characterized the story as &quot;the dirtiest hoax in the UFO history.&quot;

The Maury Island incident has inspired an eponymous film, artwork, and local celebrations in Des Moines, Washington. In 2017, the Washington State Senate acknowledged the 70th anniversary of the event.

==Background==
On June 24, 1947, private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported that he saw a string of nine shiny unidentified flying objects flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 miles an hour (1,932 km/h). Arnold&#x27;s report garnered nationwide news coverage and his description of the objects also led to the press quickly coining the terms &quot;flying saucer&quot; and &quot;flying disc&quot; as popular descriptive terms for UFOs. Ten days later, Capt. E.J. Smith, his co-pilot, and a stewardess reported witnessing unidentified objects in the Pacific Northwest.

After his story was publicized, Arnold was contacted by Raymond A. Palmer, the editor of the science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, who is sometimes associated with the coining of the descriptive term, &quot;UFO&quot;. Palmer relayed to Arnold the story of two harbor patrolmen in Tacoma who reportedly possessed fragments of a &quot;flying saucer&quot;. Palmer requested that Arnold fly to Tacoma to investigate, and on July 28, Palmer wired $200 to Arnold to fund the investigation.

==Initial story==
On July 29, Arnold interviewed Harold Dahl, who reported:
On June 21, 1947 in the afternoon about two o&#x27;clock, I was patrolling the east bay of Maury Island [...] I, as captain, was steering my patrol boat close to the shore of a bay on Maury Island. On board were two crewmen, my fifteen-year-old son and his dog. As I looked up from the wheel on my boat I noticed six very large doughnut-shaped aircraft.

Dahl said that one of the objects &quot;began spewing forth what seemed like thousands of newspapers from somewhere on the inside of its center. These newspapers, which turned out to be a white type of very light weight metal, fluttered to earth&quot;. According to Dahl, a substance resembling lava rocks fell onto their boat, breaking a worker&#x27;s arm and killing a dog.

Dahl said his superior officer, Fred Crisman, investigated the incident. Dahl also claimed he was later approached by a man in a dark suit and told not to talk about the event. Crisman, when interviewed, reported having recovered debris from Maury Island and having witnessed an unusual craft.

==Further investigation==
Arnold first recruited Captain E.J. Smith of United Airlines, who had reported witnessing a flying disc on July 4. Crisman showed &quot;white metal&quot; debris to Arnold and Smith, who interpreted it as mundane and inconsistent with Dahl&#x27;s description. Arnold then decided to contact Lieutenant Frank Brown of Military Intelligence, Fourth Air Force, Hamilton Field, California. Brown arrived at Arnold&#x27;s hotel in Tacoma along with Captain William L. Davidson.

Davidson and Brown conducted interviews, collected fragments, and prepared for the return flight to California out of McChord Field. In the early hours of August 1, the B-25 Mitchell the two officers were piloting crashed outside of Kelso, Washington, killing both men.

The FBI then began a formal investigation into Dahl and Crisman&#x27;s claims, and quickly determined that they were false, noting that Dahl stated &quot;if questioned by the authorities he was going to say it was a hoax because he did not want any further trouble over the matter.&quot; FBI files also detail a few alternate stories communicated by Crisman and Dahl to local newspapers and other media outlets, and conclude that the two men had contacted a variety of publications &quot;in the hope of building up their story through publicity to a point where they could make a profitable deal with &quot;Fantasy Magazine&quot;, Chicago, Illinois.&quot;

==Legacy==
Writing in 1956, Air Force officer Edward J. Ruppelt concluded, &quot;The whole Maury Island Mystery was a hoax. The first, possibly the second-best, and the dirtiest hoax in the UFO history.&quot; Ruppelt observed:
The majority of the writers of saucer lore have played this sighting to the hilt, pointing out as their main premise the fact that the story must be true because the government never openly exposed or prosecuted either of the two hoaxers. This is a logical premise, but a false one. The reason for the thorough investigation of the Maury Island Hoax was that the government had thought seriously of prosecuting the men. At the last minute it was decided, after talking to the two men, that the hoax was a harmless joke that had mushroomed, and that the loss of two lives and a B-25 could not be directly blamed on the two men.

Despite the FBI promptly determining that the entire incident was a hoax, the tale has been retold numerous times. Gray Barker&#x27;s 1956 book &quot;They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers&quot;, which helped to popularize the concept of &quot;men in black&quot;, cited the supposed event. The debunked Majestic 12 documents also referenced the story, claiming that the metal fragments were part of a nuclear reactor, and had been turned over to the CIA. In &quot;The UFO Investigator&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, published in 1999, Craig Glenday gives the Maury Island incident and Arnold&#x27;s sighting as examples of notable UFO encounters in the area of Mount Rainier, which he describes as a &quot;UFO laborator[y]&quot;.

The story continues to be noted locally as well. The 2014 short film &quot;The Maury Island Incident&quot; depicts the hoax and resulting events from Dahl&#x27;s point of view. Art patron John White commissioned a mural by Nancy and Zach Pahl depicting the incident. The artwork is in Des Moines, which is East of Maury Island, on the opposite side of Puget Sound. In 2017, the Washington State Senate passed a resolution acknowledging the 70th anniversary of the alleged event. In 2024, the city of Des Moines held their third annual &quot;Men in Black Birthday Bash&quot; on June 22.

<doc id="705068" wikidata="Q1438650" url="?curid=705068" title="Fort Pickens">
<text>Fort Pickens is a historic pentagonal United States military fort on Santa Rosa Island in the Pensacola, Florida, area. It is named after American Revolutionary War hero Andrew Pickens. It is the largest of four forts built to defend Pensacola Bay and its navy yard. The fort was completed in 1834 and was one of the few forts in the South that remained in Union hands throughout the American Civil War. It remained in use until 1947. Fort Pickens is included within the Gulf Islands National Seashore, and as such, is administered by the National Park Service.

== Design ==
Fort Pickens was part of the Third System of Fortifications, meant to enhance the old earthworks and simple, obsolete designs of the First and Second System of Fortifications. Fort Pickens was of a Pentagonal design, with broader western walls to provide a wide range of fire over the bay.

The fort had a counterscarp to the east side exclusively, to create a defensive moat in the event that a land invasion came from the west. The westernmost Bastions were also equipped with mine chambers, to be detonated in a last-ditch-effort to save the fort from invaders.

==History==
After the War of 1812, the United States decided to fortify all of its major ports. French engineer Simon Bernard was appointed to design Fort Pickens. Construction lasted from 1829 to 1834, with 21.5 million bricks being used to build it. Much of the construction was done by enslaved persons. Its construction was supervised by Colonel William H. Chase of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. During the American Civil War he sided with the Confederacy and was appointed to command Florida&#x27;s troops.
 the largest of a group of fortifications designed to defend Pensacola Harbor. It supplemented Fort Barrancas, Fort McRee, and the Navy Yard. Located at the western tip of Santa Rosa Island, just offshore from the mainland, Fort Pickens guarded the island and the entrance to the harbor.

==1858 fire==
On the night of 20 January 1858, the USCS &quot;Robert J. Walker&quot; was at Pensacola when a major fire broke out at Fort Pickens. The cutter&#x27;s men and boats, joined by the hydrographic party of the United States Coast Survey steamer USCS &quot;Varina&quot;, rallied to fight the fire. The next day, the captain of the &quot;Robert J. Walker&quot; received a communication from Captain John Newton of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, who commanded the harbor of Pensacola, acknowledging the important service rendered by the &quot;Robert J. Walker&quot;.

==Civil War==
By the time of the American Civil War, Fort Pickens had not been occupied since shortly after the Mexican–American War. Despite its dilapidated condition, Lieutenant Adam J. Slemmer, in charge of United States forces at Fort Barrancas, decided Fort Pickens was the most defensible post in the area. He decided to abandon Fort Barrancas when, around midnight of January 8, 1861, his guards repelled a group of local civilians who intended to occupy the fort. Some historians claim that these were the first shots fired in the Civil War.

On January 10, 1861, the day Florida declared its secession from the Union, Slemmer destroyed over 20,000 pounds of gunpowder at Fort McRee. He then spiked the guns at Fort Barrancas, and moved his small force of 51 soldiers and 30 sailors to Fort Pickens. On January 15, 1861, and January 18, 1861, Slemmer refused surrender demands from Colonel William Henry Chase of the Florida militia. Chase had designed and constructed the fort as a captain in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Slemmer defended the fort against threat of attack until he was reinforced and relieved on April 11, 1861, by Colonel Harvey Brown and the USS &quot;Brooklyn&quot;. The fort was further reinforced by Colonel William Wilson and elements of the 6th New York Infantry Regiment by late June 1861.

The Confederates attacked the Fort on October 9, 1861, in the Battle of Santa Rosa Island, with a force of a thousand men. The attack came from the east, after forces landed four miles away. The attack was repelled by artillery and gunfire, and the Confederates retreated with 90 casualties.

=== Bombardments ===
After tensions in Pensacola grew, and the Confederates secured posts at Fort McRee and Fort Barrancas, the Federal forces decided to shell the confederate forts. On November 22, two Union warships, the &quot;Niagara&quot; and the &quot;Richmond&quot;, sailed into the bay, and the bombardment began. The attack lasted two days, and the results were in the Union&#x27;s favor. Fort McRee was nearly destroyed, and the town of Warrington and the Navy Yard were destroyed.

A second bombardment, meant to finish off the Confederates, was initiated on New Year&#x27;s Day 1862. Fort McRee was almost destroyed, and any buildings near Fort Barrancas were burned.
=== Confederate surrender ===
Running low on supplies, and with dwindling morale, the Confederates began to doubt their chances of success in the Battle of Pensacola. Eventually, the Battle of Mobile Bay drew the last of the southern forces westward to Alabama to defend against Admiral Farragut&#x27;s invasion forces. On May 10, 1862, the last Confederates at Pensacola surrendered to Fort Pickens.

Despite repeated Confederate threats, Fort Pickens was one of only four Southern forts to remain in Union hands throughout the war, the others being Fort Taylor at Key West, Florida, Fort Jefferson at Garden Key, Florida in the Dry Tortugas, and Fort Monroe in Virginia.

==Indian wars==
Captives from Indian Wars in the West were transported to the East Coast to be held as prisoners. From October 1886 to May 1887, Geronimo, a noted Apache war chief, was imprisoned in Fort Pickens, along with several of his warriors. Their families were held at Fort Marion in St. Augustine.

==Endicott era==
During the late 1890s and early 20th century, the Army had new gun batteries constructed at Fort Pickens. These batteries were part of a program initiated by the Endicott Board, a group headed by a mid-1880s Secretary of War, William C. Endicott. Instead of many guns concentrated in a traditional thick-walled masonry structure, the Endicott batteries are spread out over a wide area, concealed behind concrete parapets flush with the surrounding terrain. The use of the accurate, long-range weapons eliminated the need for the concentration of guns that was common in the Third System fortifications. Battery Pensacola was constructed within the walls of Fort Pickens, while other similar concrete batteries were constructed to the east and west as separate facilities. The ruins of these later facilities are also included in the Gulf Islands National Seashore complex. As at many posts, obsolete weapons were repurposed during World War I; Battery Cooper&#x27;s 6-inch M1905 guns on disappearing carriages were removed in 1917, but a piece located at West Point was moved to Battery Cooper in 1976.

Little consideration was given to the preservation of the old fort during the construction of Endicott Batteries. The parapet on The south wall of the fort was demolished, along with the officers&#x27; quarters beneath. The barbette on the southeast wall was also removed, along with the casemate arches of the southernmost bastion. These changes were made to allow the firing arc of Battery Pensacola&#x27;s 12-inch Guns to clear with having to raise the battery.
On June 20, 1899, a fire in Fort Pickens&#x27; Bastion D reached the bastion&#x27;s magazine, which contained of powder. The resulting explosion killed one soldier and obliterated Bastion D. The force of the explosion was so great that bricks from Bastion D&#x27;s walls landed across the bay at Fort Barrancas, more than 1.5 miles (2.4 km) away. The damage was relatively confined to Bastion D, but the foundations were torn away along with sections of the walls to allow for easier access to the batteries. This proved easier than trying to fit mechanical equipment for Battery Pensacola through the Sally Port.

==Post WW I==

=== GPF Battery ===
As with many other forts, Panama mounts were planned for in the interwar era, beginning in 1937. Four 155mm GPF guns were placed around Battery Cooper, two forward, and one to each side, in 1942. The guns used concrete rings for positioning and aiming, which still remain today. The guns, however, have been long since removed. The 155 battery used Battery Cooper&#x27;s magazines, communications, and other support facilities.

=== Battery Langdon ===
Battery Langdon was constructed in 1923, with 12-inch guns meant to complement those already in place at Battery Pensacola. The guns were originally exposed to fire, but the ammunition and command center was stored inside of a reinforced embankment between the guns. The guns were later casemated in 1943.

== World War II ==
Fort Pickens was of interest in World War II to the U.S. Navy, and it was decided that the defenses of the fort needed to be strengthened. A specific threat was German U-Boats, which were already operating in the Gulf of Mexico.

=== Battery 234 ===
One addition to Fort Pickens&#x27;s defense was Battery 234, which was meant to function alongside Battery 233 across the bay on Perdido Key. Many of these batteries were built across the nation, all with the same design, to replace the role of light artillery formerly held by the 3-Inch M1903 guns. Both batteries were designed to equip two 6-Inch M1905 guns in cast-steel casemates. The command center is buried underneath an artificial hill to protect from air attacks. The guns were never fitted during the war, but were donated in 1976 by the Smithsonian and are present today. 

=== Battery Langdon (1943) ===

To protect from the threat of German dive bombers, Battery Langdon was casemated in 1943. The 12-inch barbette guns that were in place were kept, but 17 feet of concrete was added to create a bomb proof bunker. The bunker was then covered in sand and dirt to create an artificial hill around the battery, for additional protection.

==Nearby fortifications==
Fort McRee was built on Perdido Key across Pensacola Pass from Fort Pickens. Abandoned by Union forces and taken over by Florida and Alabama militia in January 1861, it was badly damaged by Union bombardment during the American Civil War later that year. Abandoned by Confederate forces, Fort McRee remained in ruins for the next three decades. Although improved in the late 19th century during the run-up to the Spanish–American War, the fort was struck by a hurricane on September 26–27, 1906 that destroyed most of the newer structures erected since 1898. After the hurricane, only a minimal caretaker staff was based there to ensure security of the site. Due to its site being accessible only by foot or boat, Fort McRee was left to the elements. Storms and erosion have battered the site; today, nothing more than a few scattered foundations remain.

Fort Barrancas, which was built around previously constructed 17th- and 18th-century Spanish forts, as well as Fort Barrancas&#x27; associated Advanced Redoubt approximately a mile (1.6 km) to the northwest of Fort Barrancas, are located across Pensacola Bay on the grounds of what is now Naval Air Station Pensacola. When Union forces abandoned Fort McRee in 1861, they also abandoned Fort Barrancas, pulling back to Fort Pickens. This fort was also occupied by Florida and Alabama militia forces, who were subsequently integrated into the Confederate forces. In May 1862, after hearing that the Union Army had taken New Orleans, Confederate troops abandoned Pensacola and Fort Barrancas. The fort reverted to Union control.

<doc id="705070" wikidata="Q1428686" url="?curid=705070" title="Oculus (architecture)">
<text>An oculus (; : oculi) is a circular opening in the center of a dome or in a wall. Originating in classical architecture, it is a feature of Byzantine and Neoclassical architecture. 

A horizontal oculus in the center of a dome is also called opaion (; : opaia).

==Oeil-de-boeuf==


An oeil-de-boeuf (; ), also œil de bœuf and sometimes anglicized as ox-eye window, is a relatively small elliptical window, typically for an upper storey, and sometimes set in a roof slope as a dormer, or above a door to let in natural light. These are relatively small windows, traditionally oval. The term is increasingly used for circular windows (in which case it could also be called an oculus), but not for holes in domes or ceilings.

Windows of this type are commonly found in the grand architecture of Baroque France. The term is also applied to similar round windows, such as those found in Georgian architecture in Great Britain, and later Greek Revival and Colonial Revival styles in North America, so that must be considered part of the usage. The term initially applied to horizontal elliptical windows, but is also used for vertical ones.

The spread is not limited to ecclesiastical architecture. This type of window can also be found in the late Romanesque period in the area of secular architecture in the castles of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, Holy Roman Emperor from 1220 to 1250, (Castel del Monte, Palazzo San Gervasio, on the donjon in the castle of Lucera, etc.), later also in Renaissance palaces and villas and in the Baroque.

==History==
===Classical===
The oculus was used in Ancient Roman architecture, one of the finest examples being that in the dome of the Pantheon, Rome. Open to the weather, it allows rain and air to enter and fall to the floor, where it is carried away through drains. Though the opening looks small, it actually has a diameter of , allowing it to light the building.

===Byzantine===
The oculus was widely used in the architecture of the Byzantine Empire. It was applied to buildings in Syria in the 5th and 6th centuries and again in the 10th century. In Constantinople&#x27;s Myrelaion Church (c. 920), there are two oculi above the stringcourse on both lateral facades.

===Renaissance===
Early examples of the oculus in Renaissance architecture can be seen in Florence Cathedral, in the nave clerestory and topping the crowns of the arcade arches.

===Neoclassical===
Since the revival of dome construction beginning in the Italian Renaissance, open oculi have been replaced by light-transmitting cupolas and other round windows, openings, and skylights. They can be seen in the pediments of Palladio&#x27;s Villa Rotonda, though not in the dome. Use of oculus windows became more popular in Baroque architecture. Widely used by Neo-Palladian architects including Colen Campbell, one can be seen in the dome of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Rotunda at the University of Virginia.

<text>Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line, titled Dragon Warrior II when initially localized to North America, is a 1987 role-playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix for the Nintendo Entertainment System as a part of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series. Enix&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary published the American release, &quot;Dragon Warrior II&quot;, for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; is set one hundred years after the events of the first game.

The game&#x27;s story centers on the prince of Midenhall, who is ordered to stop an evil wizard named Hargon after Hargon destroys Moonbrooke Castle. On his adventure, he is accompanied by his two cousins, the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke. &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; expands on the first game by having a larger party, more areas to explore, multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, and a sailing ship. The game&#x27;s successor, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, follows the ancestor of the main characters, the legendary hero Erdrick; and the three games are collectively called &quot;Erdrick Saga Trilogy&quot;.

Planning began a month before the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in &quot;Wizardry&quot;. The artwork that was used as the basis for the characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students not familiar with the coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;.

&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; was successful in Japan; the original Famicom version shipped over copies. Later, the game was remade for the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Color and combined with the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game in a release entitled &quot;Dragon Quest I &amp; II&quot;. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on June 26, 2014, and worldwide on October 9, 2014, as &quot;Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line&quot;. The game was praised for improving on almost all aspects of the original, including having better graphics, having a larger world to explore, and more characters to participate in a more dynamic combat system.

&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; is known as one of the most difficult &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, especially in its late game, and retained that reputation even in later ports to other platforms that made the game somewhat more forgiving.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; is a role-playing video game. It allows the player to control more than one character, each of whom has their own characteristics, and it is the first game in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members during the course of the game. The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.

While wandering fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, the player randomly encounters monsters, after which the game shifts to battle mode. The game&#x27;s battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the one-on-one battles of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. In the battle mode, the player gives orders to the characters on how to fight the monsters. Once the player defeats all of the monsters, the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters&#x27; experience levels. This improves the characters&#x27; attributes, and they may also learn new spells.

To win, the player must fight monsters to improve the characters&#x27; experience levels and get gold to buy better weapons and armor. Eventually, the player&#x27;s characters become strong enough to make it to the next town or dungeon. This repeats until the player reaches the final boss and defeats him. However, the gameplay is not necessarily linear, especially after the player gets the boat. Exploration is a key component of the game. The game offers a few spots to save the game. In most of the towns, talking to a king or minister saves the game. In the American version, which incorporated a battery for saved games rather than the password system of the original, talking to the king also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games.

&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the previous game, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. The game is the first in the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, &quot;Dragon Warrior II&quot; offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. &quot;Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line&quot; was also the first &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).

== Plot ==
&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; is set one hundred years after &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard, Hargon, who seeks to summon the demon, Malroth, to destroy the world. A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs the king of the attack before he dies. The king then commands his son, who is a descendant of Erdrick (known as Loto in Japanese translations and some later localizations), to defeat Hargon.

The Prince begins his quest alone, but is later joined by two cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey at the same time as the Prince of Midenhall, they restore the Princess of Moonbrooke to her human form, having been transformed into a dog during Hargon&#x27;s assault on Moonbrooke Castle, which was reduced to ruins. As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure a ship that allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, including Alefgard, which is where &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; took place. There, they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information. He tells them that, by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create the Charm of Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions. After obtaining the Charm of Rubiss, the party travels to Hargon&#x27;s castle in the ice-covered plateau of Rhone and confronts Hargon in his throne room. Hargon is defeated, but he offers himself to Malroth and the demon emerges to destroy the heroes. Together, the three heroes slay Malroth and return to Midenhall, where the Prince is named the new king.

== Development ==

Like other main games in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, Yuji Horii wrote the story for &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, Akira Toriyama did the artwork, and Koichi Sugiyama composed the music. Co-creator Koichi Nakamura, Chunsoft&#x27;s president, directed the game and did half of the programming.

Planning for &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; began in April 1986, a month before the release of the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. With the system and memory map decided, they started development in early July. At the beginning of development, producer Yukinobu Chida asked director and programmer Koichi Nakamura for a definite release date, and he offhandedly set one. Then the development team was divided into two groups, with one designing the story, as well as the monsters, and one doing the programming. The initial deadline was set for early November, but the game ultimately suffered a small delay. The development team had finished programming almost everything by the time of the initial release and believed the game could be released by the end of that year. In the Japanese magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, published on November 11, 1986, it was announced that the game would be released in late December. However, the developers found that the game was too difficult, so it was delayed for a month to adjust the balance. They had to finish the final version in mid-December, which they did, and then rushed to deliver to Nintendo to make the physical game cartridges. The game was released on January 26, 1987.

The developers believed that &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;″s one-vs-one combat system was &quot;tedious&quot; and too simple, and that the leveling system was &quot;boring&quot;, so they decided to have &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; use a party system with players controlling multiple characters. In another game from the time entitled &quot;Wizardry&quot;, players can control a party of up to six characters directly; Nakamura saw this, liked the idea, and wanted to do something similar. Due to technical restrictions, they decided to use only three characters; the Famicom video game system supports the display of up to eight sprites side by side, and one game character used two units in a direction, so it was possible for up to three characters to talk with a non-playable character (NPC). Yuji Horii believed many players would play &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; without first playing &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and thus had players search for the other party members. During development, the staff discussed the idea of deprecating the &quot;stair&quot; command of the predecessor several times. Nakamura has stated that the Cave of Rhone found in the game is inspired by a classic trick to exit mazes, that of always moving forward while sticking to the right-hand side wall to avoid traps.

In the story group, monsters were the first thing designed. The monsters&#x27; names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full drawings rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story&#x27;s plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5 mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that was easy for organizing; their manuscript thickness is 15 cm.

Compared with its predecessor, the game was more advanced in nearly all technological aspects. Koichi Nakamura programmed with several students, but since it was his first time working with a team, he did not know how to delegate work or communicate his goals. Since the students were unfamiliar with the coding process, they did not know how to debug or to keep track of whose code it came from, so Nakamura had to do it himself, which caused delays. In programming, they did the maps first. Then they worked on characters, including numbered characters in maps for assigned lines, and designed the NPC&#x27;s moving route. The next step was programming the items, while the final step was setting the monsters data and converting Toriyama&#x27;s artwork. This work was completed by the end of October.

Due to the aforementioned balance issues, the game was initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat that he used to adjust the game&#x27;s setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Furthermore, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura did not think over the boat, so if players get the boat to some land might be quickly defeated. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.

Due to a lack of cartridge space, many ideas were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is assassinated by the Prince of Cannock&#x27;s sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes. Also, the Promontory of Olivia in &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; was initially an idea for &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;. The game cartridge&#x27;s ROM capacity is 1 Mbit, but only about 10 bytes of free space remains in final products.

=== 1990 North American localization ===

The North American release of the game as &quot;Dragon Warrior II&quot; was created by Enix themselves and published in 1990. Unlike the original Japanese Famicom version, which used passwords for saving, the NES version used an internal battery backup instead to record the player&#x27;s progress. The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is presented exclusively in &quot;Dragon Warrior II&quot;. In the Japanese original, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, seeking help from its king. The dialogue of the American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version. Like &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, the American version of &quot;Dragon Warrior II&quot; was censored in some aspects; for example, it used a ghost-like sprite instead of the original defeated character&#x27;s coffin with cross sprite.

=== Music ===

Koichi Sugiyama composed and directed the music for the game. The first album of &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, &quot;Suite Dragon Quest II ~Gods of the Evil Spirits~&quot;, was released in February 1987. It covers ten orchestra version soundtracks with a twenty-five minute &quot;original sound story&quot;; this suite was performed by the Tokyo Strings Ensemble. Some of the tracks are classical and some are jazz. On August 20, 1987, the first &quot;Family Classic Concert&quot; was held. In this concert, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;&#x27;s music was performed by the Tokyo Strings Ensemble. Later in October 1987, the concert recording was released as a symphonic suite CD under the title &quot;Dragon Quest in Concert&quot;. Music of &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; were also released as a piano CD, a Drama CD and several Symphonic Suite albums. &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;&#x27;s musics were also collected in music compilations, like &quot;Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Best Selection Vol.1 ~Roto~&quot; (1997), &quot;Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1&quot;–&quot;3&quot; (2001–2002), &quot;Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD-Box&quot; (2003) and &quot;Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Scene-Separated I~IX&quot; (2011).

&quot;Only Lonely Boy&quot;, the background music in the game&#x27;s name and password input interface, was arranged as a vocal promotional song and released as a single by Anna Makino named “Love Song Sagashite”. Since the sequel takes place 100 years after the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, Sugiyama decided to use pop music to suggest the game took place at a later time than the previous game. This music is also used for Japan professional baseball team Chiba Lotte Marines&#x27; fight song. The song that is played when wandering the fields of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Unknown World&quot;, is also played when the Hero is in that area. The ending theme &quot;My Road, My Journey&quot; is also the ending song of related anime &quot;Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai&quot;.

=== Remakes ===

&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; was ported to MSX computers in February 1988, but the ported version had many issues like choppy scrolling, black-surround characters titles, poor graphics, along with sluggish combat and menus. The MSX2-ported version was released in May 1988 in Japan.

On December 18, 1993, &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; was remade and combined with &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; as part of &quot;Dragon Quest I &amp; II&quot; for the Super Famicom, which used &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;&#x27;s engine. Besides enhanced in graphics and sound, gameplay was also improved. The Super Famicom remake features an improved enemy targeting system: if an enemy is defeated before a character who was assigned to attack can perform its attack move, the character will attack another enemy rather than do nothing like in the Famicom version. And like its successors, players can find stat-improving items from pots or dressers. The Super Famicom remake was only released in Japan.

In 1999, &quot;Dragon Quest I &amp; II&quot; was released for Game Boy Color; the game is also compatible with the Game Boy. A year later, it was localized in America as &quot;Dragon Warrior I &amp; II&quot;. This remake is similar to the Super Famicom version, but with 8-bit graphics. Compared with the NES version, it featured better graphics and was less difficult. The remake also provided a quick-save function to allow players save and load game anywhere unless they reset the Game Boy. In the Game Boy Color localization, the main characters&#x27; and towns&#x27; names were retranslated to be similar to the original Japanese names: legendary hero &quot;Erdrick&quot; was retranslated as &quot;Loto&quot;, and the castle name &quot;Midenhall&quot; was re-dubbed &quot;Lorasia&quot;. The original translation had a lot of errors, and Enix changed the names to help fix that.

&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; was remade for Japanese NTT DoCoMo brand cell phones in 2005. The remakes size was four times bigger than the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; port, and since phone capacity was limited, the game was divided into two parts. The first part was pre-installed in cell phones and the second part could be downloaded for free. The world map was provided by a pre-installed PDF file. In 2006 Japanese mobile companies BREW and SoftBank also started selling the game on their mobile platforms.

Both the Famicom and Super Famicom versions of this game, along with &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;, were re-released under the &quot;Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Collection&quot; compilation for the Wii in Japan on September 15, 2011. The Wii compilation featured interruptive save functions for each games. The compilation also included original copies of the strategy guides for the games, along with original artwork and material on the games&#x27; development.

Square Enix announced the first eight &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; titles would be re-released on Android and iOS in Japan. This &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; was based on the previous cell phone version while optimized for smartphones and was released on June 26, 2014, in Japan. An English version was released on October 9, 2014, under the title &quot;Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line&quot;. Square Enix registered this trademark in Japan in 2013, and in United States in early 2014.

In the Nintendo Direct in June 2024, a HD-2D remake of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;II&quot; was announced to be released in 2025 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

== Other media ==
Several guide books were published: the first was published by Shueisha in February 1987, the second by Tokuma Shoten in July 1987, and the third by game publisher Enix in 1988 as an &quot;official guide book&quot;.

Similar to other early main games in the series, &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; was novelized and adapted to game books. The &quot;Dragon Quest II Novel&quot; was written by Hideo Takayashiki and published in 1989; it was reprinted in 1991 and 2000. The &quot;Dragon Quest II Game Book&quot; series was also published in 1989.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Sales ===
&quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; received both critical and financial success in Japan. The Famicom version sold 500,000 copies on its first release in Japan, and copies by the end of the year, grossing several hundred million dollars. The Famicom version&#x27;s total sales had later increased to as of 2008. The Super Famicom and Game Boy Color remakes together shipped in excess of 1.92 million copies worldwide. The Japan Mobile version was downloaded more than one million times. The game was included in a 2011 compilation called &quot;Dragon Quest Collection&quot; for the Wii, which sold 403,953 copies.

=== Reviews ===
Readers of &quot;&quot; gave it a score of 28.02 out of 30, and named it the best overall cartridge game of the year. In 2006, readers of &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine voted the game the 17th best video game of all time.

The game is generally known for fixing problems found in the first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a larger world, better graphics, and the ability to carry more items. Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game&#x27;s music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy. Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom version&#x27;s difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss&#x27;s ability to cast a &quot;Healall&quot; spell, and this has led to some critics calling the game &quot;the most difficult &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;&quot;. After &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot; was released, director Koichi Nakamura said &quot;In result, &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; received favourable reviews from everybody, but as myself on the creator&#x27;s side, I feel that I did about only half what I wanted to do.&quot;

Remakes of &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; were also successful and well received. &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded the Japanese Super Famicom remake a 35/40. The Game Boy Color remake got a 30/40 from &quot;Famitsu&quot;, and the U.S. version, &quot;Dragon Warrior I &amp; II&quot;, received fairly high marks, including an 8.0 out of 10 from IGN, a 9.6 out of 10 from GameSpot, and 8 out of 10 from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. It also received the RPGamer&#x27;s Game Boy Color Award of the Year for 2000.

=== Other media ===
The release of &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; also promoted sales of the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, and with the success of &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, the series became a Japanese cultural phenomenon. The sequel to &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation&quot;, was released in 1988 in Japan. It serves as a prequel to the first two games and follows the ancestor of the main characters, the legendary hero, Erdrick; the three games are collectively called &quot;Erdrick Saga Trilogy&quot;. Also with the success of the Game Boy Color remake, Enix released a Game Boy Color &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; in 2001, which was based on the Japan-only Super Famicom update of the original &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. The world of &quot;Dragon Quest II&quot; was later used as the setting of &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart&quot; on the Game Boy Advance.

<doc id="705082" wikidata="Q2025080" url="?curid=705082" title="John Steel (drummer)">
<text>John Steel (born 4 February 1941) is an English musician who is the long-serving drummer for the Animals. Having served as the band&#x27;s drummer at its inception in 1963, he is the only original band member playing in the current incarnation of the Animals. He was inducted with the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

==Early life==
John Steel was the youngest of four children. He attended Gateshead Grammar School. As a child, he and his siblings took piano lessons, though only Steel would go on to have a career in music. Growing up, Steel was exposed to records from Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Fats Waller and Sid Phillips.

==Career==
===Early career===
Steel started his career as a musician while still in school around 1957. He met the future lead singer of the Animals, Eric Burdon, while they were studying together at the Newcastle College of Art and Industrial Design. After the college and before forming the band, he obtained a job in the drawing office of an aircraft company, which he later labelled &quot;awful&quot;. 

His main instrument at this time was the trumpet, which was the instrument he played in the first group that he and Burdon were in together. Steel&#x27;s musical influences initially came from traditional jazz, but he later drew influence from modern jazz. When he transitioned to drums, Steel admired jazz drummers such as Elvin Jones and Art Blakey. They switched from jazz to embrace the new rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll explosion.

=== The Animals ===

In March 1959, Steel met Alan Price at a church hop in Byker, Newcastle, and with Hilton Valentine (guitar) and Chas Chandler (bass) formed a band; by 1960 the Alan Price Combo had acquired a reputation in Newcastle. Burdon joined in 1962 from a band called the Pagans, and the Animals were born. Their career went worldwide in late 1964 with their rendition of the traditional folk song The House of the Rising Sun.

Steel went on to play and record with them until February 1966. His last charted single with the group was &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot;. Over the years Steel has remained active as a part-time local drummer and has joined several Animals&#x27; reunion incarnations.

In 1977, Steel played and recorded with the original members of The Animals during a brief reunion and he joined them again for a further revival in 1983.

Steel, with all but lead singer Eric Burdon of the classic members, were present at the bands induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

===Business career and Eggs over Easy===
Subsequently, Steel returned to Newcastle and became a businessman, while also working in former bandmate Chas Chandler&#x27;s management and publishing organisations. In 1971, Chandler introduced him to the band Eggs over Easy, with whom he played as they started the pub rock music genre.

=== Newer versions of The Animals ===
Since 1993, Steel has toured as the drummer with variations of the Animals line-up including Hilton Valentine, Dave Rowberry, Zoot Money and Mick Gallagher. 

In 1993, Hilton Valentine formed &quot;Animals II&quot;, which was joined by John Steel in 1994 and Dave Rowberry in 1999. Other members of this version of the band include Steve Hutchinson, Steve Dawson and Martin Bland. From 1999 until Valentine&#x27;s departure in 2001, the band toured as the Animals. 

After Valentine left this Animals incarnation in 2001, Steel and Rowberry continued as &quot;Animals and Friends&quot;, with Peter Barton, Jim Rodford and John Williamson, joined on occasion by ex-&quot;New Animals&quot; bassist Danny McCulloch. When Rowberry died in 2003, he was replaced by Mickey Gallagher (who had briefly replaced Alan Price in 1965). Animals and Friends continues to perform today, and frequently plays engagements on a Color Line ship that travels between Scandinavia and Germany. 
=== Other works ===
In 2003, Steel provided an invited review of &quot;Sick of Being Me&quot;, a novel by Sean Egan, a novelist and journalist with a number of publications relating to the music industry. The novel concerned the challenges to a struggling musician in the 1990s.

===Ownership of Animals name===
In 2008, an adjudicator determined that John Steel owned &quot;The Animals&quot; name in Britain, by virtue of a trademark registration Steel had made in relation to the name. Eric Burdon had objected to the trademark registration, arguing that Burdon personally embodied any goodwill associated with &quot;the Animals&quot; name. Burdon&#x27;s argument was rejected, in part based on the fact that he had billed himself as &quot;Eric Burdon and the Animals&quot; as early as 1967, thus separating the goodwill associated with his own name from that of the band.

In 2013, Eric Burdon won an appeal, allowing both to use the Animals name.

<doc id="705092" wikidata="Q5196940" url="?curid=705092" title="Cutter John">
<text>Cutter John is a fictional character in the 1980s comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot; by Berke Breathed.

Cutter, a Vietnam War veteran using a wheelchair due to paraplegia from a war injury, was one of the county&#x27;s most well-liked citizens. Despite being somewhat childish and awkward at times, he was very popular with the ladies, particularly schoolteacher Bobbi Harlow. His aging mother, who visited on December 9, 1982, still called him &#x27;Pumpkin&#x27;. Cutter also was a good friend to many of the animal characters of Bloom County, often role-playing &quot;Star Trek&quot; with them (using his wheelchair as the &quot;Enterpoop&quot;): in the reboot, they engage in &quot;Star Wars&quot; roleplay (aboard the recumbently configured &quot;Aluminum Falcon&quot;).

Cutter claims he was injured outside Quảng Trị in 1969, in a booby-trapped tunnel. He says that three of his buddies risked their lives to save him. Because he was inside a tunnel, he probably was a tunnel rat during the war.

In one story arc, he and Opus the Penguin were lost at sea (after Oliver Wendell Jones had converted Cutter&#x27;s wheelchair into a helium balloon) while attempting to cause havoc at the South African embassy in Washington, D.C. (their goal was to turn the South African ambassador black).

Having blown off course and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, Cutter was captured by a Soviet submarine and held as a spy. Opus developed amnesia during the incident and found his way back to the Bloom Boardinghouse, and told everyone what had happened once his memory returned. Eventually Cutter was traded for Bill the Cat, who had apparently been moonlighting as a spy. He appeared much less often after that. In one Sunday strip, it is revealed that &quot;Cutter John&#x27;s&quot; true name is Cutter Jeff. He prefers to be called Cutter John, though.

Cutter John is one of Breathed&#x27;s oldest characters, first appearing in &quot;The Academia Waltz&quot;. (In those days his name was given as &quot;Saigon John&quot; and his war injury is described as taking a shot (presumably friendly fire) while smoking a bong (improvised from his M16) with a North Vietnamese soldier, making his tunnel rat story presumably a retcon). His more familiar name is most likely a reference to Trapper John McIntyre from &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. While a major character in the first half of &quot;Bloom County&quot; nine-year run, his role was reduced to only occasional cameos for the remainder of that strip and its immediate spin-off, &quot;Outland&quot;. In the commentary in one of the &quot;Bloom County&quot; collections, Breathed observed that he dropped Cutter John from the strip because it was too artistically challenging and &quot;frustrating&quot; to draw someone sitting down in every panel of the comic. According to Breathed, a wheelchair-using fan of the strip, upon hearing this observation, said Breathed &quot;ought to try sitting in a wheelchair [himself] for real frustration&quot;. In the revival &quot;Bloom County&quot; strips, Cutter John has been seen standing with the aid of forearm crutches.

His sole appearance in Breathed&#x27;s last strip, &quot;Opus&quot;, comes in a one-panel cameo, alongside Bill the Cat, Michael Binkley, Milo Bloom, and Oliver Wendell Jones, when Steve Dallas &quot;flashes back&quot; and sees them shortly before going to see Opus in the Animal Shelter in the strip&#x27;s final storyline. This makes Cutter the second character (after Dallas) to appear in all four of Breathed&#x27;s comics.

He returns in the 2015 &quot;Bloom County&quot; revival, where after accidentally running her over during one of his pop culture mash-up fantasies, begins dating Cozy Fillerup, who lives in the Bloom Boarding House.

<text>The Bihu dance is an indigenous folk dance from the Indian state of Assam related to the Bihu festival and an important part of Assamese culture. Performed in a group, the Bihu dancers are usually young men and women, and the dancing style is characterized by brisk steps and rapid hand movements. The traditional costume of dancers is centered around the red color theme, signifying joy and vigour. It is performed by Kundan.

== History==
The origins of the dance lies in ethnic groups, such as Deoris, Sonowal Kacharis, Morans, Chutias, Boros, Rabhas, and Borahis, among others. According to scholars, the Bihu dance has its origins in ancient fertility cults that were associated with increasing the fertility of the population as well as the land. Traditionally, local farming communities performed the dance outdoors, in fields, groves, forests or on the banks of rivers, especially under the fig tree.

Bihu is mentioned in the inscriptions of the 14th-century Chutia King Lakshminaryan as well.

== Description==

The dance begins with the performers, young men and women, slowly walking into the performance space. The men then start playing musical instruments, like drums (particularly the double-headed dhol), horn-pipes and flutes, while the women place their hands above their hips with their palms facing outwards, forming an inverted triangular shape. The women then start to slowly move in tune with the music by swaying, while bending slightly forward from the waist. Gradually, they open up their shoulders and place their legs slightly apart, adopting the main posture used in the Bihu dance. Meanwhile, the music played by the men picks up in temp, leading women to thrust forward their breasts and pelvis, alternatively, to the tune.

Some variations include men and women forming lines that face one other by holding each other&#x27;s neck or waist, with more advanced sequences of the dance including men and women pairing up at the center of the performance area and dancing in a manner that imitates copulation.

== Culture and social ==
The Bihu dance takes its name from the Bohag Bihu festival (also called &quot;Rangali Bihu&quot;), the national festival of Assam, which celebrates the Assamese New Year. The festival takes place in mid-April, and the Bihu dance is meant to celebrate and emulate the seasonal spirit, celebrating fertility and passion.

Bihu is performed by groups of young men and women, and in earlier times, it served principally as a courtship dance. The Bihu dance&#x27;s association with fertility refers to both human fertility, through the erotic nature of the dance, as well as the fertility of nature, meaning the celebration of spring and the welcoming of the life-giving spring rain. The use of instruments such as drums and hornpipes is believed to replicate the sound of rain and thunder as a way of invoking actual precipitation.

Historically, there is evidence that the Bihu dance was looked down upon in Assamese society, especially during colonial times, because of the sexually charged nature of the performance, which clashed with the Victorian views that were dominant at the time among British colonists.
Presently, the Bihu dance is a cultural emblem in modern-day Assamese society, becoming a symbol of the Assamese cultural identity. The first time that the Bihu dance was performed on a stage was in 1962, as part of a cultural event that took place in Guwahati.

== Mega Bihu Event ==
Assam state has made a Guinness world record for performing the largest Bihu dance in one single venue on April 14, 2023. The event took place at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium, Guwahati Assam. A group of 11,000 Bihu dancers and drummers participated.

<doc id="705109" wikidata="Q3787698" url="?curid=705109" title="Hurt No More">
<text>Hurt No More is the second studio album by American singer Mario Winans. It was released by Bad Boy Records and Universal Records on April 20, 2004, in the United States.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Hurt No More&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. Allmusic editor Andy Kellman called the album &quot;one of the finest R&amp;B albums of the year.&quot; He found that while &quot;nothing about &quot;Hurt No More&quot; is radically exceptional, it is, however, full of small surprises [and] as rich as humbled, sincerely sensitive male R&amp;B gets in 2004.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; writer Steve Jones wrote that &quot;in his second solo album, Winans spends much of his time taking the blows from all sorts of bad relationships [...] After years of playing in the background, it seems that the talented Winans is ready for his close-up.&quot; &quot;Vibe&quot; editor Tim Bower called the album a &quot;charming throwback.&quot; Jon Caramanica from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated &quot;Hurt No More&quot; two out of five starts. He felt that &quot;though his melodies are strong, his lyrics lack punch. And while his voice quivers with hurt, it never achieves true angst, suggesting that even heartbreak can be smoothed over.&quot; &quot;musicOMH&quot;″ Azeem Ahmad found that &quot;the album isn&#x27;t great, and other than &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know there&quot; isn&#x27;t much in the way of mainstream single potential, but that&#x27;s the nature of the genre. This is a must-have for any R&amp;B fan – anyone else should approach with caution.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Hurt No More&quot; debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 behind Usher&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; (2004), and atop the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, selling 223,000 copies in its first week. It also debuted and peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; was issued as the album&#x27;s lead single. Based on a sample of the song &quot;Boadicea&quot; by Irish singer Enya from her 1987 self-titled album which came to prominence on The Fugees track &quot;Ready or Not&quot; from the album &quot;The Score&quot; (1996), the song features a rap by P. Diddy. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; was released in early 2004 and became a worldwide hit, reaching number in Germany and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythmic Top 40, also peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

<doc id="705114" wikidata="Q5110363" url="?curid=705114" title="Christian politics in New Zealand">
<text>This article discusses Christian politics in New Zealand.

The monarch of New Zealand, who is New Zealand&#x27;s head of state, is also the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. But the country itself, unlike the United Kingdom, has no official or established religion, and freedom of religion has been protected since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. As of the 2018 census, 37% of New Zealanders were affiliated with a Christian religion of some denomination, compared with 48% who had no religion, 9% who followed another religion, and 7% who objected to answering. There are a range of views on the extent to which Christianity affects New Zealand politics.

During the nineteenth century, many church-oriented bodies sponsored and fostered several of the original European settlement-ventures in the period 1840–1850, notably the settlements of Otago (1848, Free Church of Scotland) and Canterbury (1850, Church of England)—and many evangelicals, fundamentalists and conservative Catholics see Christianity as underlying New Zealand&#x27;s entire political system.

On the other hand, a notable politician of the late 19th century, Sir Robert Stout, had a considerable reputation as a freethinker.

Christianity has never had an explicit role in the major political parties, and the religious elements in these parties have taken varying forms, and cannot easily be classified as a single movement.

Māori Christianity, particularly the Rātana movement has often been of importance, with an historic alliance between it and the Labour Party signed in 1936, and many other parties now vying for their support, but this is generally regarded as a political rather than religious matter.

In the 1990s a series of Christian political parties such as Christian Heritage, the Christian Democrats, the Christian Coalition and Destiny New Zealand arose out of a Christian conservative strand in the 1970s and 1980s, mostly in reaction to a perceived decline of social standards; but none reached 5% of the vote in any election. To date, the same has been true of the New Conservative Party, New Zeal Party and Freedoms New Zealand, their contemporary successors in the 2020s.

== Before the 1970s: debates over prohibition and capital punishment ==
Before the establishment of major specifically Christian parties in the 1970s, evangelical or fundamentalist Christianity had had little specific effect on mainstream New Zealand politics in society. While the Baptist Union endeavoured to get alcohol-prohibition policies passed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Catholic Church urged its members to vote against such laws, concerned that the measures would outlaw wine for the Eucharist. A referendum on prohibition took place in 1919, but the return of demobilised New Zealand soldiers from World War I defeated the measure. Evangelical and Catholic New Zealanders did not respond as corporate institutions to the debates on capital punishment in New Zealand in the thirties, forties and fifties, but individual laypeople and clergy did make their opposition heard. The Anglican Church of New Zealand became more forthright in its opposition to the death penalty, and as the largest Christian denomination in New Zealand, it made its presence felt.

== Christianity within mainstream political parties ==
Neither the Labour Party nor the National Party, the two traditional dominant mainstream political parties in New Zealand since the 1930s, represent explicitly religious traditions. Nevertheless, both parties have occasionally contained people who saw their political mission in religious terms. A number of early politicians, both in Labour and in National, saw their respective political ideologies as an extension of &quot;Christian values&quot;.

In the early Labour Party a significant sub-set of the party promoted what one might call &quot;Christian socialism&quot;, New Zealand&#x27;s first Labour Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage is said to have personified Labour&#x27;s &quot;Applied Christianity&quot;. Labour won an overwhelming victory by presenting itself as the party of practical Christian compassion, in contrast to the &quot;anti-family&quot; depression-era coalition government. It was in this context that Savage—who would later return to his Roman Catholic roots—described Labour&#x27;s Social Security Act (1938), intended to afford security for all New Zealanders &#x27;from cradle to grave&#x27;, as &#x27;applied Christianity&#x27;.

A number of early Labour politicians had Christian backgrounds. One of the first leaders of the Labour Party, HE Holland (1919–1933), had been a street preacher with the Salvation Army in Australia prior to his migration to New Zealand. Savage&#x27;s successor, Peter Fraser (1940–49), reflected in his personal life on the lasting impact of his Scottish Presbyterian upbringing, and the next leader, Walter Nash, was &quot;an avowed Christian strongly committed to the Anglican Church&quot;. Subsequent Labour Party leaders also had church backgrounds. Arnold Nordmeyer, the leader of the Labour Party in opposition from 1963 to 1965, was an ordained Presbyterian minister. David Lange, (Prime Minister 1984–1989) was Methodist, while Norman Kirk (Prime Minister 1972–74) was raised by devout members of The Salvation Army.

Such church connections are also present in the National Party. For example, Keith Holyoake (Prime Minister 1957, 1960–72), was &quot;brought up in a strict Open Brethren environment&quot;, and in later years was an irregular attender of the Presbyterian church. John Marshall (deputy Prime Minister 1957, 1960–72; Prime Minister 1972) was active in the Presbyterian church, while Robert Muldoon (Prime Minister 1975–84) was raised as a Baptist and continued as a church member until he married and became an Anglican like his wife Thea.

The National Party, the ostensibly more socially conservative of the two &quot;major&quot; traditional parties, apparently received increasing proportional support from religiously identifiable voters between 2002 and 2005.

Also, the Rātana movement has some influence in New Zealand politics (see Māori Christianity, below).

In , however, religion has not usually formed a major component of either Labour or National platforms—and three of the last four prime ministers have described themselves as agnostic. Christopher Luxon, the opposition leader since 2021 and Prime Minister from 2023, is described as Evangelical. Michael Wood, former transport minister in the sixth Labour Government, is a practising Anglican.

== Evangelical political activism: anti-abortion activism in the 1970s ==
Beginning in the 1970s a significant increase in activism by New Zealand evangelical and conservative Catholic-based organisations occurred. Much of this opposed reforms undertaken by governments. In the 1970s and 1980s, two significant campaigns opposed the liberalisation of abortion rules and the legalisation of homosexual acts. Perhaps surprisingly, members of the generally conservative National Party (George Gair and Venn Young, respectively) championed each of these legislative measures. Organisations such as the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (now Voice for Life) and the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards (SPCS) served as a focus for Christian conservatism. Eventually, the conservatives won their initial battles against homosexual law reform, but lost their ongoing battle over abortion during the late seventies and early eighties. For more about the history of the New Zealand abortion debate, see abortion in New Zealand.

==Liberal Protestant activism: 1981–2001==
Mainline Protestant churches became involved with ending sporting contacts with South Africa during the apartheid era ( 1948–1994), culminating when many liberal Protestants and Catholics participated in mass protests against the New Zealand Rugby Football Union&#x27;s 1981 Springbok Tour of New Zealand. Shortly afterward, many of the same liberal Christians participated in the peace movement of the 1980s, which resulted in New Zealand becoming a declared nuclear free zone in 1987. During the New Zealand National Party governments of the 1990s, these liberal Christians became involved in organising against New Right cutbacks to social-welfare benefits (cutbacks supported by the New Zealand Business Roundtable, ACT New Zealand and similar organisations).

==Evangelical political activism: 1980s: moral activism==
By the early 1980s, the Christian evangelical revival of the 1960s had developed into a social movement that utilised community and political action in response to &quot;moral&quot; issues. These developments were influenced by the emergence of a vocal Christian Right in the Reagan-era United States, represented by figures such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and groups such as the Moral Majority and Christian Coalition. As with their American counterparts, these conservative evangelicals opposed homosexuality, abortion, feminism, sex education, and supported traditional family and moral values. Opposition by conservative elements within mainstream denominations towards a perceived &quot;liberal trend&quot; led to a decline in church membership by 7 percent between 1976 and 1981. By contrast, church membership at more conservative denominations, such as the Pentecostal churches, rose by 127 percent during that period.

In March 1985, Labour&#x27;s Fran Wilde introduced a new homosexual law reform bill. This became a moral issue for New Zealand religious conservatives to rally against. Two National members of parliament, Graeme Lee and Norman Jones, organised a petition against the bill; and three Labour MPs, Geoff Braybrooke, Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan, and Allan Wallbank supported their campaign. A number of activists from the United States provided advice. At about the same time, the Coalition of Concerned Citizens (CCC) formed, using the motto &quot;For God, Family and Country&quot;, while many liberal Anglicans and Methodists formed a &quot;Christians for Homosexual Law Reform&quot; network to counter their efforts. The campaign against homosexual law reform eventually failed, however, and the bill became law in 1986.

Like their American counterparts, conservative evangelical movements in New Zealand also tended to be strongly anti-Communist. One such activist, Barbara Faithfull, founder of the pressure group CREDO, alleged that Soviet Communists were using sex education, abortion, and homosexuality to undermine the &quot;moral fabric&quot; of Western civilization. Some conservative evangelical elements, such as Faithfull and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens, also joined forces with other right-wing groups in alleging that there was a conspiracy by Communist groups such as the pro-Moscow Socialist Unity Party (SUP) to infiltrate the Labour Party, the trade unions, and exploit various popular issues such as the anti-Springbok tour protests, the Māori biculturalism, and the anti-nuclear movement. In response to perceived Communist influence within these popular causes, some conservative Christian elements such as the CCC and former–Communist–turned–right-wing pundit Geoff McDonald supported maintaining ties with South Africa and preserving the ANZUS security alliance with the United States and Australia.

The CCC and another evangelical advocacy group, the Concerned Parents Association (CPA), also criticised the introduction of Māori biculturalism and multiculturalism into the education system as &#x27;anti-Christian&#x27; for allegedly promoting alternative religious beliefs. The CPA and Geoff McDonald also criticised the National Council of Churches in NZ for allegedly creating a sense of guilt among White New Zealanders by highlighting historic issues such as Māori land confiscations during the New Zealand Wars. Several conservative evangelical periodicals such as &quot;Coalition Courier&quot;, &quot;Family Alert&quot; and &quot;Challenge Weekly&quot; were used to disseminate these ideas.

During the 1987 general election, conservative Christian elements including the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), Women for Life and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens tried to infiltrate the National Party by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates. Conservative Christian groups and periodicals, such as the &quot;Coalition Courier&quot; and &quot;Challenge Weekly&quot;, also attacked the Labour government&#x27;s policies towards peace education, sex education, abortion, and Māori biculturalism. However, they met little success in this effort and the National Party leadership responded by quietly centralizing its candidate selection procedures. Increased evangelical political activism did, however, set the stage for the emergence of several evangelical Christian political parties during the next twenty-five years (see below).

==Evangelical parties==
A number of New Zealand evangelical Christian political parties emerged in times:
*Christian Heritage Party (1989–2006)
*Christian Democrat Party (1995–1998)
*Destiny New Zealand (2007–10)
*Family Party (2007–10)
*Vision New Zealand (2019–) (initially to be Coalition NZ)
===ONE Party (2020–23)/ New Zeal Party (2023–) ===

In June 2020, another Christian party called ONE Party was launched under the leadership of Stephanie Harawira and Edward Shanly. The ONE Party says that it wants to promote a Christian voice in Parliament.

== Māori Christianity ==
The first significant specifically Christian political party activity in New Zealand came at the behest of the Rātana movement. The Rātana Church, established by Māori spiritual leader Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana in 1925, gained particularly strong support from Māori of lower socio-economic status. The Rātana movement actively participated in the world of politics, and the first Rātana Member of Parliament gained election in a 1932 by-election.

In Parliament, the Rātana movement co-operated closely with the Labour Party, the rising force in New Zealand politics in the 1930s. In the 1935 elections, Rātana won two of the four Māori seats, and shortly afterwards allied itself with the Labour Party, which had won the election. The Labour Party and the Rātana movement have remained closely allied since this point, although the alliance has grown strained at times, and both National and the Māori Party also vie for their support.

===Piri Wiri Tua Movement===
In years at least one independent attempt has occurred to bring the Rātana religion to politics — the Piri Wiri Tua party, although not part of the Rātana Church, has strong roots in Ratanadom.

<doc id="705128" wikidata="Q4907706" url="?curid=705128" title="Dupin cyclide">
<text>In mathematics, a Dupin cyclide or cyclide of Dupin is any geometric inversion of a standard torus, cylinder or double cone. In particular, these latter are themselves examples of Dupin cyclides. They were discovered by (and named after) Charles Dupin, while he was still a student at the École polytechnique following Gaspard Monge&#x27;s lectures. The key property of a Dupin cyclide is that it is a channel surface (envelope of a one-parameter family of spheres) in two different ways. This property means that Dupin cyclides are natural objects in Lie sphere geometry.

Dupin cyclides are often simply known as &quot;cyclides&quot;, but the latter term is also used to refer to a more general class of quartic surfaces which are important in the theory of separation of variables for the Laplace equation in three dimensions.

Dupin cyclides were investigated not only by Dupin, but also by A. Cayley, J.C. Maxwell and Mabel M. Young.

Dupin cyclides are used in computer-aided design because cyclide patches have rational representations and are suitable for blending canal surfaces (cylinder, cones, tori, and others).

==Definitions and properties==
There are several equivalent definitions of Dupin cyclides. In formula_1, they can be defined as the images under any inversion of tori, cylinders and double cones. This shows that the class of Dupin cyclides is invariant under Möbius (or conformal) transformations.
In complex space formula_2 these three latter varieties can be mapped to one another by inversion, so Dupin cyclides can be defined as inversions of the torus (or the cylinder, or the double cone).

Since a standard torus is the orbit of a point under a two dimensional abelian subgroup of the Möbius group, it follows that the cyclides also are, and this provides a second way to define them.

A third property which characterizes Dupin cyclides is that their curvature lines are all circles (possibly through the point at infinity). Equivalently, the curvature spheres, which are the spheres tangent to the surface with radii equal to the reciprocals of the principal curvatures at the point of tangency, are constant along the corresponding curvature lines: they are the tangent spheres containing the corresponding curvature lines as great circles. Equivalently again, both sheets of the focal surface degenerate to conics. It follows that any Dupin cyclide is a channel surface (i.e., the envelope of a one-parameter family of spheres) in two different ways, and this gives another characterization.

The definition in terms of spheres shows that the class of Dupin cyclides is invariant under the larger group of all Lie sphere transformations; any two Dupin cyclides are Lie-equivalent. They form (in some sense) the simplest class of Lie-invariant surfaces after the spheres, and are therefore particularly significant in Lie sphere geometry.

The definition also means that a Dupin cyclide is the envelope of the one-parameter family of spheres tangent to three given mutually tangent spheres. It follows that it is tangent to infinitely many Soddy&#x27;s hexlet configurations of spheres.

== Parametric and implicit representation ==
: (CS): A Dupin cyclide can be represented in two ways as the envelope of a one parametric pencil of spheres, i.e. it is a canal surface with two directrices. The pair of directrices are focal conics and consists either of an ellipse and a hyperbola or of two parabolas. In the first case one defines the cyclide as &quot;elliptic&quot;, in the second case as &quot;parabolic&quot;. In both cases the conics are contained in two mutually orthogonal planes. In extreme cases (if the ellipse is a circle) the hyperbola degenerates to a line and the cyclide is a torus of revolution.

A further special property of a cyclide is:
: (CL): Any curvature line of a Dupin cyclide is a &quot;circle&quot;.

=== Elliptic cyclides ===
An elliptic cyclide can be represented parametrically by the following formulas (see section Cyclide as channel surface):

:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6
The numbers formula_7 are the semi major and semi minor axes and formula_8 the linear eccentricity of the ellipse: 
:formula_9 
The hyperbola formula_10
is the focal conic to the ellipse. That means: The foci/vertices of the ellipse are the vertices/foci of the hyperbola. The two conics form the two degenerated focal surfaces of the cyclide.

formula_11 can be considered as the average radius of the generating spheres.

For formula_12 , formula_13 respectively one gets the curvature lines (circles) of the surface.

The corresponding implicit representation is:
:formula_14

In case of formula_15 one gets formula_16, i. e. the ellipse is a circle and the hyperbola degenerates to a line. The corresponding cyclides are tori of revolution.

More intuitive design parameters are the intersections of the cyclide with the x-axis. See section Cyclide through 4 points on the x-axis.

=== Parabolic cyclides ===
A parabolic cyclide can be represented by the following parametric representation (see section Cyclide as channel surface):

:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20 determines the shape of both the parabolas, which are focal conics: 
:formula_21 and formula_22

formula_23 determines the relation of the diameters of the two holes (see diagram). formula_24 means: both diameters are equal. For the diagram is formula_25.

A corresponding implicit representation is
:formula_26

&quot;Remark&quot;: By displaying the circles there appear gaps which are caused by the necessary restriction of the parameters formula_27.

== Cyclide as channel surface ==

There are two ways to generate an elliptic Dupin cyclide as a channel surface. The first one uses an ellipse as directrix, the second one a hyperbola:

=== Ellipse as directrix ===

In the x-y-plane the directrix is the ellipse with equation
:formula_28 and formula_29. 
It has the parametric representation
:formula_30
formula_31 is the semi major and formula_32 the semi minor axis.
formula_8 is the linear eccentricity of the ellipse. Hence: formula_34.
The radii of the generating spheres are
:formula_35
formula_11 is a design parameter. It can be seen as the average of the radii of the spheres. In case of formula_16 the ellipse is a circle and the cyclide a torus of revolution with formula_11 the radius of the generating circle (generatrix).

In the diagram: formula_39.
=== Maxwell property ===
The following simple relation between the actual sphere center (ellipse point) and the corresponding sphere radius is due to Maxwell:

* The difference/sum of the sphere&#x27;s radius and the distance of the sphere&#x27;s center (ellipse point) from one (but fixed) of the foci is constant. 

;Proof
The foci of the ellipse formula_40 are formula_41. If one chooses formula_42 and calculates the distance formula_43, one gets formula_44. Together with the radius of the actual sphere (see above) one gets formula_45.
&lt;br&gt;
Choosing the other focus yields: formula_46 

Hence:

In the x-y-plane the envelopes of the circles of the spheres are two circles with the foci of the ellipse as centers and the radii formula_47 (see diagram).

=== Cyclide through 4 points on the x-axis ===


The Maxwell-property gives reason for determining a ring cyclide by prescribing its intersections with the x-axis:

&quot;Given:&quot; Four points formula_48 on the x-axis (see diagram).

&quot;Wanted:&quot; Center formula_49, semiaxes formula_50, linear eccentricity formula_8 and foci of the directrix ellipse and the parameter formula_11 of the corresponding ring cyclide.

From the Maxwell-property one derives
:formula_53 
Solving for formula_54 yields
:formula_55 formula_56
The foci (on the x-axis) are 
:formula_57 and hence
: formula_58 
The center of the focal conics (ellipse and hyperbola) has the x-coordinate
:formula_59

If one wants to display the cyclide with help of the parametric representation above one has to consider the shift formula_49 of the center !

;Meaning of the order of the numbers formula_61:
(The calculation above presumes formula_48, see diagram.)

(H) Swapping formula_63 generates a horn cyclide.&lt;br&gt;
(S) Swapping formula_64, generates a spindel cyclide.&lt;br&gt;
(H1) For formula_65 one gets a 1-horn cyclide.&lt;br&gt;
(R) For formula_66 one gets a ring cyclide touching itself at the origin.

=== Parallel surfaces ===
By increasing or decreasing parameter formula_11, such that the type does not change, one gets parallel surfaces (similar to parallel curves) of the same type (see diagram).

=== Hyperbola as directrix ===

The second way to generate the ring cyclide as channel surface uses the focal hyperbola as directrix. It has the equation

:formula_68
In this case the spheres touch the cyclide from outside at the second family of circles (curvature lines). To each arm of the hyperbola belongs a subfamily of circles. The spheres of one family enclose the cyclide (in diagram: purple). Spheres of the other family are touched from outside by the cyclide (blue).

Parametric representation of the hyperbola:
:formula_69
The radii of the corresponding spheres are 
:formula_70

In case of a torus (formula_16) the hyperbola degenerates into the axis of the torus.

===Maxwell-property (hyperbola case)===
The foci of the hyperbola formula_72 are formula_73. The distance of hyperbola point formula_74 to the focus formula_75 is formula_76 and together with the sphere radius formula_77 one gets formula_78. Analogously one gets formula_79 . For a point on the second arm of the hyperbola one derives the equations: formula_80

Hence: 

In the x-z-plane the circles of the spheres with centers formula_81 and radii formula_82 have the two circles (in diagram grey) with centers formula_83 and radii formula_84 as envelopes.

=== Derivation of the parametric representation ===
==== Elliptic cyclide ====

The ellipse and hyperbola (focal conics) are the degenerated focal surfaces of the elliptic cyclide. For any pair formula_85 of points of the ellipse and hyperbola the following is true (because of the definition of a focal surface):
:1) The line formula_86 is a normal of the cyclide and
:2) the corresponding point formula_87 of the cyclide divides the chord formula_88 with relation formula_89 (see diagram).

From the parametric representation of the focal conics and the radii of the spheres
:Ellipse: formula_90
:Hyperbola: formula_91

one gets the corresponding point formula_87 of the cyclide (see diagram):
:formula_93
(For the unusual but convenient parametric representation of the hyperbola: see hyperbola.)

Calculation in detail leads to the parametric representation of the elliptic cyclide given above.

If one uses the parametric representation given in the article on channel surfaces, then, in general, only one family of parametric curves consists of circles.

==== Parabolic cyclide ====

The derivation of the parametric representation for the parabolic case runs analogously:

With the parametric representations of the focal parabolas (degenerated focal surfaces) and the radii of the spheres:
:formula_94
:formula_95

one gets 
:formula_96
which provides the parametric representation above of a parabolic cyclide.

== Dupin cyclides and geometric inversions ==

An advantage for investigations of cyclides is the property:
: (I): Any Dupin cyclide is the image either of a right circular cylinder or a right circular double cone or a torus of revolution by an inversion (reflection at a sphere).

The inversion at the sphere with equation formula_97 can be described analytically by:
: formula_98
The most important properties of an inversion at a sphere are:
# Spheres and circles are mapped on the same objects.
# Planes and lines containing the origin (center of inversion) are mapped on themselves.
# Planes and lines &quot;not&quot; containing the origin are mapped on spheres or circles passing the origin.
# An inversion is involutory (identical with the inverse mapping).
# An inversion preserves angles.

One can map arbitrary surfaces by an inversion. The formulas above give in any case parametric or implicit representations of the image surface, if the surfaces are given parametrically or implicitly. In case of a parametric surface one gets:
:formula_99

But: Only in case of right circular cylinders and cones and tori of revolution one gets Dupin cyclides and vice versa.

=== Example cylinder ===
a) Because lines, which do not contain the origin, are mapped by an inversion at a sphere (in picture: magenta) on circles containing the origin the image of the cylinder is a ring cyclide with mutually touching circles at the origin. As the images of the line segments, shown in the picture, there appear on line circle segments as images. The spheres which touch the cylinder on the inner side are mapped on a first pencil of spheres which generate the cyclide as a canal surface. The images of the tangent planes of the cylinder become the second pencil of spheres touching the cyclide. The latter ones pass through the origin.
b) The second example inverses a cylinder that contains the origin. Lines passing the origin are mapped onto themselves. Hence the surface is unbounded and a parabolic cyclide.

=== Example cone ===
The lines generating the cone are mapped on circles, which intersect at the origin and the image of the cone&#x27;s vertex. The image of the cone is a double horn cyclide. The picture shows the images of the line segments (of the cone), which are circles segments, actually.

=== Example torus ===
Both the pencils of circles on the torus (shown in the picture) are mapped on the corresponding pencils of circles on the cyclide. In case of a self-intersecting torus one would get a spindle cyclide.

;Villarceau circles

Because Dupin ring-cyclides can be seen as images of tori via suitable inversions and an inversion maps a circle onto a circle or line, the images of the Villarceau circles form further two families of circles on a cyclide (see diagram). 

;Determining the designparameters formula_7
The formula of the inversion of a parametric surface (see above) provides a parametric representation of a cyclide (as inversion of a torus) with circles as parametric curves. But the points of a parametric net are not well distributed. So it is better to calculate the design parameters formula_7 and to use the parametric representation above:
&quot;Given:&quot; A torus, which is shifted out of the standard position along the x-axis. 
Let be formula_102 the intersections of the torus with the x-axis (see diagram). All not zero. Otherwise the inversion of the torus would not be a ring-cyclide.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Wanted:&quot; semi-axes formula_50 and linear eccentricity formula_8 of the ellipse (directrix) and parameter formula_11 of the ring-cyclide, which is the image of the torus under the inversion at the unitsphere.

The inversion maps formula_106 onto formula_107, which are the x-coordinates of 4 points of the ring-cyclide (see diagram). From section Cyclide through 4 points on the x-axis one gets 
:formula_108 formula_109 and
:formula_110 
The center of the focal conics has the x-ccordinate
:formula_111

==Separation of variables==
Dupin cyclides are a special case of a more general notion of a cyclide, which is a natural extension of the notion of a quadric surface. Whereas a quadric can be described as the zero-set of second order polynomial in Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2,&quot;x&quot;3), a cyclide is given by the zero-set of a second order polynomial in (&quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2,&quot;x&quot;3,&quot;r&quot;2), where
&quot;r&quot;2=&quot;x&quot;12+&quot;x&quot;22+&quot;x&quot;32. Thus it is a quartic surface in Cartesian coordinates, with an equation of the form:
:formula_112
where &quot;Q&quot; is a 3x3 matrix, &quot;P&quot; and &quot;R&quot; are a 3-dimensional vectors, and &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are constants.

Families of cyclides give rise to various cyclidic coordinate geometries.

In Maxime Bôcher&#x27;s 1891 dissertation, &quot;Ueber die Reihenentwickelungen der Potentialtheorie&quot;, it was shown that the Laplace equation in three variables can be solved using separation of variables in 17 conformally distinct quadric and cyclidic coordinate geometries. Many other cyclidic geometries can be obtained by studying R-separation of variables for the Laplace equation.

<doc id="705144" wikidata="Q697530" url="?curid=705144" title="Amurru (god)">
<text>Amurru, also known under the Sumerian name Martu (in Sumerian and Sumerograms: 𒀭𒈥𒌅), was a Mesopotamian god who served as the divine personification of the Amorites. In past scholarship it was often assumed that he originated as an Amorite deity, but today it is generally accepted that he developed as a divine stereotype of them in Mesopotamian religion. As such, he was associated with steppes and pastoralism, as evidenced by his epithets and iconography. While this was initially his only role, he gradually developed other functions, becoming known as a god of the mountains, a warlike weather deity and a divine exorcist.

He is first attested in documents from the Ur III period, chiefly in Sumerian and Akkadian theophoric names. Later he also came to be worshiped in Babylon, Assur and other locations in Assyria and Babylonia. He had his own cult center somewhere in the area known as the Sealand in Mesopotamian texts. 

Only a single myth about Amurru is known. It describes the circumstances of his marriage to Adgarkidu, the daughter of Numushda, the city god of Kazallu. Other sources attest different traditions about the identity of his wife. The goddess Ashratum is particularly well attested in this role. His father was the sky god Anu and it is presumed that his mother was usually Urash.

==Origin==
Amurru was a divine representation of the Amorites, a group living in areas west of Mesopotamia. The names Amurru (Akkadian) or Martu (Sumerian) could refer both to the god and to the people. The origin of both these words is unknown, and according to Paul-Alain Beaulieu neither of them has a plausible Sumerian, Akkadian or West Semitic etymology. There is also no indication that either of them ever served as the endonym of the groups they described. 

In older literature, as late as the 1980s, it was commonly assumed that Amurru originally an eponymous deity of the Amorites themselves. However, there is general agreement that he was instead a Mesopotamian god representing the westerners.

Amurru is absent from Amorite names from the Ur III period. The evidence from the Old Babylonian period is similarly lacking: while around seven thousand linguistically Amorite names are known, none of them are theophoric names invoking Amurru. However, he appears within many Sumerian theophoric texts as Martu, especially in texts from Lagash. He is also attested in Akkadian names, though even in this case his popularity appears to be smaller in areas where a higher percentage of population was Amorite, for example in the kingdom of Mari, while in Nippur, where very few, if any, Amorites lived, they are common. Tonia Sharlach notes that the perception of Amorites in Mesopotamia is a complex issue. While literary texts describe them as archetypal barbarians, and walls were built on the borders to prevent their entry, king Shulgi was supposedly proficient in the Amorite language, and people of Amorite origin held various offices in the royal administration, and could serve as priests. Most likely the creation of a god representing them was meant to provide them with a symbolic place in Mesopotamian religion due to their growing political importance. 

Other analogous deities are also attested: Kaššû and Kaššītu, a pair of deities, respectively male and female, represented the Kassites, Aḫlamayītu was &quot;the Aramean goddess,&quot; while Sutītu - &quot;the Sutean goddess.&quot; However, these deities only emerged in the first millennium BCE, and are not attested earlier.

==Character==
In texts from the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods, Amurru chiefly functioned as a divine stereotype of Amorites. However, he gradually acquired other functions, possibly due to the growing power of Amorite dynasties in the early second millennium BCE and due to assimilation of Amorite groups into Mesopotamian society. In the Kassite period, when Amorites ceased to function as a distinct group in Mesopotamia, Amurru lost his initial function as a representation of them. As early as in the Old Babylonian period, he came to be viewed as a divine exorcist. This became his primary role at least until the reign of Sennacherib.

An association between Amurru and steppes is well attested. He could be called &quot;bel seri&quot;, &quot;the lord of the steppe.&quot; His wife, Ashratum, was referred to with the feminine equivalent of the same title, &quot;belet seri&quot;. Due to the fact that the logogram could refer to both steppes and mountains, Amurru also came to be associated with the latter environment. While the related phrase (sometimes shortened to or simply ) usually designated Enlil, there is evidence that from the Kassite period onward it could be employed to represent Amurru. Examples include theophoric names from Kassite Nippur and texts from Neo-Babylonian archive of the Eanna temple in Uruk. Amurru&#x27;s role as a mountain god is particularly commonly referenced in hymns, where his most frequent epithet is &quot;the man of the mountains,&quot; &quot;lu hursagga&quot;. A mountain range particularly frequently associated both with the god and with the historical Amorites in Mesopotamian texts was Bashar, known today as Jebel Bishri.

Amurru&#x27;s character has also been sometimes compared to that of a weather god, and in hymns he could be described as a warlike deity armed with lightning. However, he was regarded as separate from Ishkur/Adad, and his other functions did not overlap with those of weather deities.

===Iconography===
Amurru&#x27;s main attribute was the &#x27;, a type of crooked staff. Its presence has been used to identify depictions of this god on cylinder seals. It has been proposed that the &#x27; was originally a type of ordinary staff used by shepherds, perhaps to be identified with the &#x27;, &quot;large Amorite crooked staff,&quot; mentioned in a text from the Isin-Larsa period. The word &#x27; and its Ugaritic equivalent &quot;&quot; has been interpreted as referring to a type of scimitar or sickle in the past, but according to Aicha Rahmouni this translation is incorrect.

In art, Amurru could be accompanied by a horned animal interpreted as either a goat or a gazelle. In some case the animal alone could be used as a symbolic representation of the god. There is also textual evidence for an association between him and mice. It is possible the latter association was initially derogatory and was meant to imply the Amorites bring rodents with them.

Amurru is sometimes described and depicted as a sickle sword (gišzubi/gamlum).

==Worship==
Earliest indisputable evidence of the worship of Amurru comes from the Ur III period. The only possible older attestation is a name known from a document from the reign of Shar-Kali-Sharri, now considered to be dubious. Evidence for state-sponsored veneration of Amurru in the Ur III period is scarce, with only five documents mentioning offerings to him. Tonia Sharlach assumes that he was initially associated with Eridu and Kuara, as according to one of the known documents he received offerings in a temple of Damkina in the latter of these two cities.

Amurru came to be more commonly worshiped during the reign of the First Dynasty of Babylon. Later texts attest that two temples of Amurru existed in this city: Enamtaggaduha (Sumerian: &quot;house which undoes guilt&quot;) located in its eastern part and Emesikil (&quot;house of pure &quot;me&quot;s&quot;) on the opposite side. A statue of the god from the former was renewed by Esarhaddon. A temple bearing the name Emesikil was also rebuilt by Damiq-ilishu, but according to Andrew R. George it is uncertain if it was the same one known from texts about Babylon or if Amurru had a separate temple in Isin. Paul-Alain Beaulieu in a more recent publication favors the former possibility.

As early as in the Old Assyrian period, Amurru was also worshiped in Assyria, as attested in oath formulas. In Assur he was worshiped in the Enindabadua (&quot;house where bread portions are baked&quot;), which was likely a part of the temple complex of Gula. It was rebuilt by Tiglath-Pileser I. Additionally, Sennacherib installed new doors depicting Ashur accompanied by Amurru in the &quot;akitu&quot; temple of the former god. Paul-Alain Beaulieu proposes that in this case Amurru was reinterpreted as a divine representation of Arameans, who rose to prominence in Assyrian society in the first millennium BCE. He points out that in the same time period, the god started to appear in West Semitic, rather than Akkadian, theophoric names for the first time in history, which might indicate that the Arameans living in Assyria chose him as their tutelary deity. 

Amurru&#x27;s newfound popularity among speakers of West Semitic languages is also attested in the late sources from Babylonia, where he is the fourth most common deity in their theophoric names after Bel (Marduk), Nabu and Nanaya. Much of the evidence for this phenomenon comes from the Sealand, where he likely had a cult center of his own. References to it are known from the Eanna archive from Uruk. For example, one text mentions legal proceedings between two citizens of the Sealand province during which a priest and a scribe from the temple of Amurru acted as witnesses.

==Associations with other deities==
Anu was regarded as Amurru&#x27;s father. It has additionally been proposed that a variant writing of Amurru&#x27;s name, AN.dMARTU (AN.AN.MAR.TU) represents a &quot;conjoined deity&quot; consisting of Amurru and Anu. However, according to Tonia Sharlach and Paul-Alain Beaulieu it most likely should be read as the genitive Akkadian phrase &quot;dIl Amurrim&quot;, &quot;the god of Amurru,&quot; a reading according to them supported by a Hurrian translation known from a bilingual text from Emar, &quot;de-ni a-mu-ri-we&quot;, which has the same meaning. Beaulieu also points out that a Hurrian ritual text from Ugarit written in the local alphabetic script mentions &quot;i[n] amrw&quot;, which he assumes to be another reference to the Hurrian translation of Il Amurrim. Daniel Schwemer accepts that AN.AN.MAR.TU is simply a form of Amurru, but argues that the genitive interpretation is incorrect, and the name should instead be read as Ilamurrum, an extended form of the standard name, formed in an analogous way to the also attested Iluwer (Wer) or to the name of the god Ilaba. He also assumes that &quot;i[n] amrw&quot; is more likely to be a collective term, &quot;gods of the land of Amurru&quot; (in this context referring to the kingdom south of Ugarit), as it appears in sequence with &quot;in alḏyg&quot; and &quot;in ugrtw&quot;, terms which according to him are likely to refer collectively to &quot;gods of Alashiya&quot; and &quot;gods of Ugarit&quot; than to singular otherwise unattested deities.

Dietz Otto Edzard argued that the fact Amurru was regarded as a son of Anu and not Enlil might stem from his position in Mesopotamian religion. He was a comparatively minor god. Another possibility is that the comparisons between him and Ishkur contributed to the development of this genealogy. It is possible that Amurru&#x27;s weather god-like profile was in part based on the fact that Hadad was the most popular god among the Amorites, but no direct evidence in favor of this interpretation is available. They shared the epithet Rammānu, &quot;thunderer.&quot; The image of warlike Amurru known from some of the hymns dedicated to him might also be a result of association with the weather god. However, they were not equated, and could appear together on cylinder seals. There is also no indication that the logogram dIŠKUR could ever serve as a representation of Amurru&#x27;s name. In a single text, Nimgir, normally the sukkal (attendant deity) of Ishkur, appears in the circle of Amurru instead.

Due to widespread recognition of Anu as Amurru&#x27;s father, it is agreed that Urash was most likely regarded as his mother in most cases. A single reference to Ninhursag as his mother is most likely based entirely on similarity of the meaning of her name and his epithet &quot;lu hursagga&quot;. It has been proposed that the deity Suḫanunna, mentioned in the myth &quot;Marriage of Martu&quot;, was also viewed as his mother but this has been called into question. Suḫanunna might instead be an epithet of Amurru himself, possibly &quot;he of the thriving body.&quot;

A single hymn refers to Amurru as the &quot;first born of the gods of Anshan.&quot; This was most likely a reference to Amorite settlement in areas east of the Tigris, in the proximity of Elam, or possibly specifically to the background of king Kudur-Mabuk, known for his Amorite and Elamite connections.

Multiple traditions regarding the identity of Amurru&#x27;s wife are known. In &quot;Marriage of Martu&quot; he marries the goddess Adgarkidu, described as the daughter of Numushda and Namrat. However, especially in cylinder seals inscriptions he often appears alongside Ashratum, a goddess of Amorite origin whose name is a cognate of that of the Ugaritic goddess Athirat. Ashratum could also be referred to with the name Gubarra, and in bilingual texts the pair Amurru and Ashratum in Akkadian correspond to Martu and Gubarra in Sumerian. It has been argued that she could be also identified with Amurru&#x27;s spouse known from the aforementioned myth. Additionally, due to the use of the epithet Belet-Seri to refer to Ashratum, in a few cases Amurru was regarded as the husband of Geshtinanna (or Azimua), also associated with this title, even though she was usually the wife of Ningishzida instead. In Amurru&#x27;s presently unidentified first millennium BCE cult center in the Sealand his spouse was the goddess Innin-galga-sud.

No references to Amurru having any children are known.

In a single inscription Amurru is paired with Ninegal/Belet Ekallim. According to Wilfred G. Lambert, this pairing is unusual, as unless an otherwise not attested tradition conflated Amurru with her spouse, the farmer god Urash, the two deities have nothing in common.

In laments, Amurru could be associated with Enkimdu. It has been suggested that their juxtaposition was meant to function similar to the pairing of Dumuzi and Enkimdu in a myth in which they compete for Inanna&#x27;s hand, with Amurru taking the role of a shepherd god meant to contrast with Enkimdu&#x27;s own functions as a divine farmer.

An etymological connection between Amurru and the Ugaritic god Qudšu-wa-Amrur, known from the Baal Cycle where he is the &quot;fisherman of Athirat,&quot; has been proposed. According to this theory, the latter deity&#x27;s name might be a compound of Amurru and the epithet &quot;qdš&quot;, &quot;holy.&quot; However, Steve A. Wiggins points out that the evidence is not conclusive, as the term Amurru is spelled as &quot;amr&quot; in the alphabetic Ugaritic texts, while &quot;Amrur&quot; in Qodesh-wa-Amrur&#x27;s name - as &quot;amrr&quot;. Additionally, no known epithet of Amurru is analogous to Ugaritic &quot;qdš&quot;.

==Mythology==
The number of known literary texts about Amurru is small. The only known composition focused on him identified as a myth is &quot;Marriage of Martu&quot;.

In the beginning of this composition, Martu (Amurru), portrayed as a leader of a group of nomads, learns from his mother that his relatives receive bigger rations despite their lower rank because they have their own families. Because of that, he decides to get married. One of his allies tells him about a festival taking place in the city of Inab, either an alternate name of Kazallu or a smaller settlement located close to it. The city god of this location, Numushda, as well as his wife Namrat and daughter Adgarkidu, will attend it, and a wrestling or fighting contest will be held as entertainment. Martu&#x27;s peer urges him to take part in it. The protagonist agrees and emerges victorious from the games, but when Numushda offers him the reward, silver and various precious stones, he asks for Adgarkidu&#x27;s hand in marriage instead. Numushda agrees, but he expects Martu to bring various marriage gifts, mostly livestock. The next passage is poorly preserved, but apparently a person whose name is not presented distributes various valuable items among the inhabitants of Inab. Most likely either Numushda does so to celebrate the marriage of his daughter, or Amurru to gain the favor of his father-in-law&#x27;s followers. A friend of Adgarkidu apparently tries to dissuade her by describing Martu&#x27;s lifestyle unfavorably, highlighting that he does not pay proper respect to Nanna, roams the countryside digging for truffles and lives in a tent, but her words are dismissed by the bride herself. 

It has been argued that &quot;Marriage of Martu&quot; was composed in the Ur III period, and reflected either a political event, perhaps the arrival of Amorites in the province governed by Puzur-Numushda during the reign of Ibbi-Sin, or simply the introduction of a new deity, Amurru, to the Mesopotamian pantheon. 

Outside of this myth, Amurru and Numushda almost never appear together, the only exceptions being two laments. One of these two texts also includes the only other known reference to Inab.

<text>The rock bunting (Emberiza cia) is a passerine bird in the bunting family Emberizidae, a group now separated by most modern authors from the finches, Fringillidae.

The genus name &quot;Emberiza&quot; is from Old German &quot;Embritz&quot;, a bunting. The specific &quot;cia&quot; is from a local Italian name for this bird, from &quot;zirlare&quot;, &quot;to chirp&quot;.

== Range ==
It breeds in northwest Africa, southern Europe east to central Asia, and the Himalayas. It also breeds locally in central Europe. It is partially migratory, with northern populations wintering further south, mainly within the breeding range of the resident southern populations. It is a rare wanderer to western Europe.

== Habitat ==
The rock bunting breeds in open dry rocky mountainous areas.

== Description ==
This bird is 16 cm in length. The breeding male has chestnut upperparts, unmarked deep buff underparts, and a pale grey head marked with black striping.

The female rock bunting is a washed-out version of the male, with paler underparts, a grey-brown back and a less contrasted head. The juvenile is similar to the female, but with a streaked head.

There are four races differing mainly in the plumage shades, although the subspecies which breeds in Europe, Africa and western Turkey is the only one to show white wing bars.

== Foraging and breeding ==
It lays three to five greyish eggs in a lined nest on the ground or occasionally in a low bush. Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds.

== Song ==
The call is a sharp &quot;tseee&quot;, and the song is a twittering &quot; churrrr-chirrriiii-itt&quot;.

<text>In geometry, a surface in 3-dimensional Euclidean space is ruled (also called a scroll) if through every point of , there is a straight line that lies on . Examples include the plane, the lateral surface of a cylinder or cone, a conical surface with elliptical directrix, the right conoid, the helicoid, and the tangent developable of a smooth curve in space.

A ruled surface can be described as the set of points swept by a moving straight line. For example, a cone is formed by keeping one point of a line fixed whilst moving another point along a circle. A surface is doubly ruled if through every one of its points there are two distinct lines that lie on the surface. The hyperbolic paraboloid and the hyperboloid of one sheet are doubly ruled surfaces. The plane is the only surface which contains at least three distinct lines through each of its points .

The properties of being ruled or doubly ruled are preserved by projective maps, and therefore are concepts of projective geometry. In algebraic geometry, ruled surfaces are sometimes considered to be surfaces in affine or projective space over a field, but they are also sometimes considered as abstract algebraic surfaces without an embedding into affine or projective space, in which case &quot;straight line&quot; is understood to mean an affine or projective line.

== Definition and parametric representation ==
A surface in 3-dimensional Euclidean space is called a &quot;ruled surface&quot; if it is the union of a differentiable one-parameter family of lines.
Formally, a ruled surface is a surface in formula_1 is described by a parametric representation of the form
: formula_2
for formula_3 varying over an interval and formula_4 ranging over the reals. It is required that formula_5, and both formula_6 and formula_7 should be differentiable.

Any straight line formula_8 with fixed parameter formula_9 is called a &quot;generator&quot;. The vectors formula_10 describe the directions of the generators. The curve formula_11 is called the &quot;directrix&quot; of the representation. The directrix may collapse to a point (in case of a cone, see example below).

The ruled surface above may alternatively be described by
: formula_12

with the second directrix formula_13. To go back to the first description starting with two non intersecting curves formula_14 as directrices, set formula_15

The geometric shape of the directrices and generators are of course essential to the shape of the ruled surface they produce. However, the specific parametric representations of them also influence the shape of the ruled surface.

== Examples == 

=== Right circular cylinder ===

A right circular cylinder is given by the equation
:formula_16
It can be parameterized as
:formula_17
:::formula_18
:::formula_19
with 
:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22

=== Right circular cone ===
A right circular cylinder is given by the equation
:formula_23
It can be parameterized as
:formula_24
:::formula_25
with
:formula_26
:formula_27
:formula_28
In this case one could have used the apex as the directrix, i.e.
:formula_29
and
: formula_30
as the line directions.

For any cone one can choose the apex as the directrix. This shows that &quot;the directrix of a ruled surface may degenerate to a point&quot;.

=== Helicoid ===

A helicoid can be parameterized as
:formula_31
:::formula_32
:::formula_33
The directrix
:formula_34
is the z-axis, the line directions are
:formula_35,
and the second directrix
:formula_36
is a helix.

The helicoid is a special case of the ruled generalized helicoids.

=== Cylinder, cone and hyperboloids ===

The parametric representation 
:formula_37
has two horizontal circles as directrices. The additional parameter formula_38 allows to vary the parametric representations of the circles. For
:formula_39 one gets the cylinder formula_40,
:formula_41 one gets the cone formula_42,
:formula_43 one gets a hyperboloid of one sheet with equation formula_44 and the semi axes formula_45.

A hyperboloid of one sheet is a doubly ruled surface.

=== Hyperbolic paraboloid ===

If the two directrices in (CD) are the lines 
:formula_46
one gets 
:formula_47,
which is the hyperbolic paraboloid that interpolates the 4 points formula_48 bilinearly.

The surface is doubly ruled, because any point lies on two lines of the surface.

For the example shown in the diagram: 
:formula_49
The hyperbolic paraboloid has the equation formula_50.

=== Möbius strip ===

The ruled surface
:formula_51 
with
:formula_52 (circle as directrix),
:formula_53
contains a Möbius strip.

The diagram shows the Möbius strip for formula_54.

A simple calculation shows formula_55 (see next section). Hence the given realization of a Möbius strip is &quot;not developable&quot;. But there exist developable Möbius strips.

=== Further examples ===
* Conoid
* Catalan surface
* Developable rollers (oloid, sphericon)
* Tangent developable

== Developable surfaces ==
For the determination of the normal vector at a point one needs the partial derivatives of the representation formula_51:
:formula_57,
:formula_58.
Hence the normal vector is
:formula_59
Since formula_60 (A mixed product with two equal vectors is always 0), formula_61 is a tangent vector at any point formula_62. The tangent planes along this line are all the same, if formula_63 is a multiple of formula_64. This is possible only if the three vectors formula_65 lie in a plane, i.e. if they are linearly dependent. The linear dependency of three vectors can be checked using the determinant of these vectors:

:The tangent planes along the line formula_66 are equal, if 
:: formula_67.

A smooth surface with zero Gaussian curvature is called &quot;developable into a plane&quot;, or just &quot;developable&quot;. The determinant condition can be used to prove the following statement:
:A ruled surface formula_51 is developable if and only if 
::formula_69 
:at every point.

The generators of any ruled surface coalesce with one family of its asymptotic lines. For developable surfaces they also form one family of its lines of curvature. It can be shown that any developable surface is a cone, a cylinder, or a surface formed by all tangents of a space curve.
The determinant condition for developable surfaces is used to determine numerically developable connections between space curves (directrices). The diagram shows a developable connection between two ellipses contained in different planes (one horizontal, the other vertical) and its development.

An impression of the usage of developable surfaces in &quot;Computer Aided Design&quot; (CAD) is given in &quot;Interactive design of developable surfaces&quot;.

A &quot;historical&quot; survey on developable surfaces can be found in &quot;Developable Surfaces: Their History and Application&quot;.

==Ruled surfaces in algebraic geometry==

In algebraic geometry, ruled surfaces were originally defined as projective surfaces in projective space containing a straight line through any given point. This immediately implies that there is a projective line on the surface through any given point, and this condition is now often used as the definition of a ruled surface: ruled surfaces are defined to be abstract projective surfaces satisfying this condition that there is a projective line through any point. This is equivalent to saying that they are birational to the product of a curve and a projective line. Sometimes a ruled surface is defined to be one satisfying the stronger condition that it has a fibration over a curve with fibers that are projective lines. This excludes the projective plane, which has a projective line though every point but cannot be written as such a fibration.

Ruled surfaces appear in the Enriques classification of projective complex surfaces, because every algebraic surface of Kodaira dimension formula_70 is a ruled surface (or a projective plane, if one uses the restrictive definition of ruled surface). 
Every minimal projective ruled surface other than the projective plane is the projective bundle of a 2-dimensional vector bundle over some curve. The ruled surfaces with base curve of genus 0 are the Hirzebruch surfaces.

==Ruled surfaces in architecture==
Doubly ruled surfaces are the inspiration for curved hyperboloid structures that can be built with a latticework of straight elements, namely:
* Hyperbolic paraboloids, such as saddle roofs.
* Hyperboloids of one sheet, such as cooling towers and some trash bins.

The RM-81 Agena rocket engine employed straight cooling channels that were laid out in a ruled surface to form the throat of the nozzle section.

<text>Walter Reed (born August 16, 1970), better known by his stage name Killah Priest, is an American rapper, a member of Sunz of Man, and a Wu-Tang Clan affiliate who was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He is known for his intensely spiritual lyrics, containing religious references and metaphors. He is connected to the Black Hebrew Israelites through his rhymes, and is known for his controversial and political subject matter. He is also a part of supergroup the HRSMN along with Canibus, Ras Kass, and Kurupt.

==Biography==
===1990s===
Killah Priest made his debut on two songs on the Gravediggaz album &quot;6 Feet Deep&quot; (which are &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; and &quot;Graveyard Chamber&quot;) in 1994, and followed this with two appearances on each of two Wu-Tang Clan solo albums, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s &quot;Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version&quot; and GZA&#x27;s &quot;Liquid Swords&quot;, both from 1995 (see 1995 in music). &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; in fact included a Killah Priest solo track titled &quot;B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)&quot;. Also in 1995, Priest&#x27;s group Sunz Of Man with rappers Hell Razah, 60 Second Assassin, Prodigal Sunn, Shabazz the Disciple were signed to Wu-Tang Records and released three 12&quot; singles through the label. Initially Sunz Of Man included Shabazz the Disciple, who had previously been in a duo with Priest called The Disciples Of Armageddon.

Killah Priest&#x27;s first solo album was &quot;Heavy Mental&quot;, released on Geffen Records on February 24, 1998. It mostly expanded on the themes of &quot;B.I.B.L.E.&quot;, featuring religious references and allegory woven into commentary on African American society and history. The album was mostly produced by the Wu-Elements producers, a group of in-house Wu-Tang producers mentored by Wu leader RZA. Sunz Of Man released their debut album &quot;The Last Shall Be First&quot; later in 1998, but by that time Priest&#x27;s ties to the Wu were beginning to weaken, as he and long-time friend Shabazz clashed with RZA (their business ties with the Wu also began to weaken after the GZA Entertainment management agency, which they were both signed to, dissolved in 1996). After unsuccessful attempts by the pair to create new post-Wu Tang crews (Priest proposed a crew called the Maccabeez which would include himself, Shabazz and Timbo King among others, while Shabazz proposed a group including himself and Priest called the Sunz Of Thunder) they both effectively went their separate ways and cut their respective Wu-Tang ties.

===2000s===
After leaving the Wu stable, and consequently also effectively leaving Sunz Of Man, Priest helped form the hip hop supergroup The HRSMN with Ras Kass, Canibus and Kurupt. In October 2003, Killah Priest and Dreddy Kruger released a nine track album entitled The Horsemen Project. It was released independently through &quot;Think Differently Music&quot;/&quot;Proverbs Music Inc.&quot; and was only available to purchase off the internet. Each track featured at least two members of the group as well as an appearance by Pak Man. It is currently unknown who handled the majority of the production on the album, although it is known that Mark Sparks was responsible for two songs. On Killah Priest&#x27;s HipHopGame.com journal, he mentions the Horsemen a few times. The talks about a new album were mentioned on the May 1, 2006 entry. He said &quot;The Horsemen project is definitely going to come. Right now we just have to get Kurupt. He&#x27;s been doing the Dogg Pound thing, but it&#x27;s definitely going to come. We have songs recorded and we have more in store.&quot;

Ras Kass and Canibus were featured on Priest&#x27;s second album, &quot;View From Masada&quot;, which featured no Wu-Tang input whatsoever (though the album&#x27;s liner notes included the note &quot;Peace to Wu-Tang Clan&quot;). The album had a decidedly more commercially minded style than &quot;Heavy Mental&quot;, and introduced his new Maccabeez such as Daddy Rose, Salahudin Rose, Sant Rose and Najee Rose—part of a crew of then-unknown rappers who now go under the name Rose Cartell. The album was an important early stepping stone to stardom for producer Najee7thStar, Daddy Rose, and Just Blaze, who would later go on to produce countless mainstream hip hop hits for the likes of Cam&#x27;ron, Erick Sermon, Fabolous and Jay-Z. However, &quot;View From Masada&quot; received mixed reviews.

Priest had to leave the major labels behind after &quot;View From Masada&quot; sold poorly. His first independent release &quot;Priesthood&quot; (2001), released on Proverbs Music, his own record label, was critically acclaimed though it suffered from very limited distribution. &quot;Black August&quot; followed in 2003 on Recon Records, and was also well received. Priest also released an album on the Internet titled &quot;Black August Revisited&quot; a few months after the release of &quot;Black August&quot; which shared few similarities with the original, save its title. &quot;Black August Revisited&quot; also saw Priest rediscover his Wu-Tang ties, including collaborations with Hell Razah and Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard. He also appeared in the music video for the single &quot;Made You Look&quot; by fellow New York rapper Nas. In 2009, Killah Priest launched the controversial music video &quot;Redemption&quot; directed by One_Over. The video promotes the beliefs of the Black Hebrew Israelites that believe in the 12 Tribes of Israel in the name of Jesus Christ (Yahawashi Ha Mashayach).

In 2004, Priest performed numerous times with other Wu-Tang Killa Beez and also appeared on Masta Killa&#x27;s album &quot;No Said Date&quot;. November 2005 saw the re-release of &quot;Priesthood&quot; on Mic Club Music, a label owned by Louis Lombard III (aka Luminati), who produced &quot;Priesthood&quot; as well as recent albums by Canibus. March 2007 saw the release of Killah Priest&#x27;s mixtape album &quot;End of the World&quot;.

On August 21, 2007, Killah Priest released The Offering, which was sequenced by his former manager, Stacey Castro and featured appearances from Nas, Immortal Technique, his fellow HRSMN, &amp; 4th Disciple as well as Hell Razah, who appears on the advance single title track that was released in October 2005.

Killah Priest next album titled &quot;Behind the Stained Glass&quot;, was released on May 20, 2008 on the label Good Hands Records. It is reported that he&#x27;s also in the midst of recording &quot;Behind the Stained Glass Part Two&quot;. Killah Priest also released an album titled &quot;Elizabeth&quot; on October 20, 2009 on Proverbs Records, which Priest owns and he put out a movie/DVD &quot;A Day In the Life of Killah Priest&quot; feat Najee7thStar and Hot Flames. Killah Priest is also recording another double album called &quot;The Psychic World of Walter Reed&quot;, produced by Dutch producers Godz Wrath, 4th Disciple, RZA, and more. Killah Priest also mentioned in a YouTube interview for &quot;Pyramid West&quot; that he is also working on a sequel to &quot;Heavy Mental&quot; called &quot;Heavier Mental.&quot;

===2010s and beyond===
In an August 2010 radio interview with Mista Montana, Killah Priest discussed the creation of his next album &quot;The Psychic World of Walter Reed&quot;, stating that the RZA and many other key Wu-Tang Clan members will feature on there, including the Four Horsemen.

After several delays, &quot;The Psychic World of Walter Reed&quot; was released on February 25, 2013. On March 11, 2013 Priest was hosting the Digital Dynasty 24, after already hosting Digital Dynasty 15.5.

Killah Priest has mentioned a number of projects he&#x27;s been working on, including &quot;The Untold Story of Walter Reed Pt. 2&quot;, &quot;Castle Hop&quot; (both produced by DJ Woool), &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; with Ghostface Killah and &quot;Planet of the Gods&quot; (produced by Dutch producer team Godz Wrath, who worked with Priest several times already). In April 2014, he said he had postponed &quot;The Untold Story of Walter Reed Pt. 2&quot;, and was finishing up &quot;Planet of the Gods&quot;, which was released on June 4, 2015. He also appeared on four tracks on the critically acclaimed album, For The Future Of Hip-Hop featuring Killah Priest, Pugs Atomz and Awdazcate, produced by Bryan Ford and released May 2016. On February 27, 2017, exactly 8 years after the first part, he released The Untold Story of Walter Reed Pt. 2.
===Podcasting===

In 2021 Priest launched his podcast on his official YouTube Channel discussing such topics in depth as Islam, Judaism, Ifá, Quimbanda, Astrotheology, Transhumanism, Cymatics, the Kabbalah, Sacred Geometry, Herbal Medicine and more . As well as interviewing a variety of guest . Some which have included Chris Taylor, 9th Prince, Shyheim, Dr. Har Hari Khalsa, Jordan Maxwell,Sophia Stewart, John Newsom, David Icke, Santos Bonacci, Scarub, Zab Judah, Flea (musician), Ras Kass, Lord Jamar and many more.

<text>Saint Nicholas Day, also called the &quot;Feast of Saint Nicholas&quot;, observed on 6 December (or on its eve on 5 December) in Western Christian countries, and on 19 December in Eastern Christian countries using the old church Calendar, is the feast day of Saint Nicholas of Myra; it falls within the season of Advent. It is celebrated as a Christian festival with particular regard to Saint Nicholas&#x27; reputation as a bringer of gifts, as well as through the attendance of church services.

In the European countries of Germany and Poland, boys have traditionally dressed as bishops and begged alms for the poor. In the Portuguese city of Guimarães, the Nicolinas, a series of festivities in honor of Saint Nicholas happen every year. In Poland and Ukraine children wait for St. Nicholas to come and to put a present under their pillows provided that the children were good during the year. Children who behaved badly may expect to find a twig or a piece of coal under their pillows. In the Netherlands and Belgium children put out a shoe filled with hay and a carrot for Saint Nicholas&#x27; horse. On Saint Nicholas Day, gifts are tagged with personal humorous rhymes written by the sender. In the United States, one custom associated with Saint Nicholas Day is children leaving their shoes in the foyer on Saint Nicholas Eve in hope that Saint Nicholas will place some coins on the soles.

The American Santa Claus, as well as the British Father Christmas, derive from Saint Nicholas. &quot;Santa Claus&quot; is itself derived in part from the Dutch &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;, the saint&#x27;s name in that language. However, the gift giving associated with these descendant figures has come to be associated with Christmas Day rather than Saint Nicholas Day itself.

==Saint Nicholas==
Nicholas of Myra, according to Christian tradition, was born in Patar in Asia Minor. He is said to have made a pilgrimage to Egypt to study theology under the Desert Fathers after which he was consecrated the Bishop of Myra. During the Diocletianic Persecution of Christians, Nicholas of Myra was imprisoned. He was released after Constantine the Great promulgated the Edict of Milan in 313, which allowed for the public practice of Christianity in the Roman Empire. Nicholas of Myra was known for his generosity through a Christian legend, in which he gave a poor father money in order to prevent his daughters from being taken into slavery, as the father did not have the funds for his daughters&#x27; dowries. It is said that Nicholas of Myra threw the money through the family&#x27;s window, which landed in their shoes, which were drying near their fireplace.

Nicholas of Myra died on 6 December 346, giving rise to the present Feast of Saint Nicholas. The saint was entombed in St. Nicholas Church, Demre, though in 1087, Italian soldiers transferred his remains to Italy, where they were enshrined in the Basilica di San Nicola and are held to this day. Saint Nicholas&#x27; tomb is said to exude the Oil of Saint Nicholas, which has attracted, throughout the centuries, Christian pilgrims who take the oil home in small bottles to use during prayer.

Nicholas of Myra is the patron hallow of children, sailors, those undergoing financial problems, and victims of fire.

In the 11th century, Christian nuns in Belgium and France initiated the practice of giving the poor gifts in the name of Saint Nicholas. This custom spread to Germany and Holland further spreading the Feast of Saint Nicholas and its associated customs.

==Traditions by continent==

===Europe===

==== Balkans ====

Among Albanians, Saint Nicholas is known as Shen&#x27;Kollë and is venerated by most Catholic families, even those from villages that are devoted to other saints. The Feast of Saint Nicholas is celebrated on the evening before 6 December, known as Shen&#x27;Kolli i Dimnit (Saint Nicholas of Winter), as well as on the commemoration of the interring of his bones in Bari, the evening before 9 May, known as Shen&#x27;Kolli i Majit (Saint Nicholas of May). Albanian Catholics often swear by Saint Nicholas, saying &quot;Pasha Shejnti Shen&#x27;Kollin!&quot; (&quot;May I see Holy Saint Nicholas!&quot;), indicating the importance of this saint in Albanian culture, especially among the Albanians of Malësia. On the eve of his feast day, Albanians will light a candle and abstain from meat, preparing a feast of roasted lamb and pork, to be served to guests after midnight. Guests will greet each other, saying, &quot;Nata e Shen&#x27;Kollit ju nihmoftë!&quot; (&quot;May the Night of Saint Nicholas help you!&quot;) and other such blessings. The bones of Albania&#x27;s greatest hero, George Kastrioti, were also interred in the Church of Saint Nicholas in Lezha, Albania, upon his death.

In Greece, Saint Nicholas does not carry an especial association with gift-giving, as this tradition is carried over to St. Basil of Caesarea, celebrated on New Year&#x27;s Day. St. Nicholas is the protector of sailors, he is considered the patron saint of the Greek Navy, military and merchant alike, and his day is marked by festivities aboard all ships and boats, at sea and in port. According to the tradition, it is Agios Nikolaos who makes the winds rage and cease, he can walk on the seas and whenever there is a ship in trouble, he would save it.

It is also associated with the preceding feasts of St. Barbara (4 December), St. Savvas (5 December), and the following feast of St. Anne (9 December); all these are often collectively called the &quot; Nikolobárbara&quot;, and are considered a succession of days that heralds the onset of truly wintry cold weather in the country. Therefore, by tradition, homes should have already been laid with carpets, removed for the warm season, by St. Andrew&#x27;s Day (30 November), a week ahead of the &quot;Nikolobárbara&quot;.

In Serbia, &quot;Nikoljdan&quot; is celebrated on 19 December. Since &quot;Nikoljdan&quot; always falls during the fasting period preceding Christmas, it is celebrated according to the Eastern Orthodox fasting rules (&quot;Post&quot;). This entails the complete avoidance of animal-sourced food products (meat, milk, dairy products, and eggs). The hosts who celebrate as the tradition says, prepare smoked carp for guests.

In Bulgaria, Saint Nicholas Day is celebrated on 6 December as &quot;Nikulden&quot;. Families invite relatives, sponsors, and neighbors for a meal of fish (usually &quot;ribnik&quot;, a carp wrapped in dough) and two loaves of ceremonial bread, all of which are blessed at church or at home. The host wafts incense over the table, then lifts and breaks the bread. Bulgarians also observe 6 December as the name day for those with the names &quot;Nikola&quot;, &quot;Nikolay&quot;, &quot;Kolyo&quot;, &quot;Nikolina&quot;, &quot;Neno&quot;, &quot;Nenka&quot;, &quot;Nikoleta&quot; and &quot;Nina&quot;.

====Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg====

In the Netherlands, his feast day is celebrated on 5 December, the Eve of Saint Nicholas. It is believed that &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; travels from Spain by boat. His arrival each November is a big event for children. In the days leading up to 5 December, young children put their shoes in front of the chimneys and sing &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; songs. The next morning they find a small present in their shoes, ranging from sweets to marbles or some other small toy. He is assisted by many mischievous helpers, called &#x27;Zwarte Pieten&#x27; (&quot;Black Petes&quot;) or &quot;Père Fouettard&quot; in the French-speaking part of Belgium, with black faces and colourful Moorish dress, dating back two centuries. In the past, it was said that the Zwarte Pieten took all the naughty children, put them into sacks, and Sinterklaas took them with him to Spain.

On the Frisian islands (&quot;Waddeneilanden&quot;), the Sinterklaas feast has developed independently into traditions very different from the one on the mainland. On the island of Terschelling mainly, but also other Wadden Islands, Sundrum is the name given to Sinterklaas.&lt;

In recent years there has been a recurrent discussion about the perceived politically incorrect nature of Zwarte Piet. In particular Dutch citizens with an Afro background or African roots might feel offended by the Dutch slavery history connected to this emblem and regard the representation of Zwarte Piet as racist. Others state that the black skin color of Zwarte Piet originates in his profession as a chimney sweep, hence the delivery of packages through the chimney.

The rise of Father Christmas (known in Dutch as &quot;de Kerstman&quot;) is often cited as an example of globalization and Americanisation.
In Belgium, they celebrate &quot;Sinterklaasfeest&quot; (Dutch-speaking) or &quot;la Saint-Nicolas&quot; (French-speaking) on the morning of 6 December. He arrives by steamboat around mid-November every year when he makes his annual entry in Antwerp, an event that is usually attended by hundreds of children. &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; wears a bishop&#x27;s robes including a red cape and mitre and rides a white horse named &quot;Schimmel&quot; or &quot;Amerigo&quot; in the Netherlands and &quot;Slecht Weer Vandaag&quot; (bad weather today) in Flanders. The town of Sint-Niklaas in East Flanders has a statue of Sinterklaas in front of its town hall.

In Luxembourg, during the run-up to 6 December, &quot;De Kleeschen&quot; visits schools. He wears a bishop&#x27;s mitre on his head and carries a bishop&#x27;s crosier. &quot;De Kleeschen&quot; gives presents to well-behaved children; his companion the &quot;Houseker&quot; gives those who have misbehaved twigs. 
==== Eastern Central Europe and Eastern Europe ====


In Slovenia, Miklavž (&quot;Sveti Miklavž&quot;) and in Croatia, Nikolaus (&quot;Sveti Nikola&quot;) who visits on Saint Nicholas day (&quot;Nikolinje&quot; in Croatia and &quot;Miklavževanje&quot; in Slovenia) brings gifts to children commending them for their good behavior over the past year and exhorting them to continue in the same manner in the year to come. If they fail to do so they will receive a visit from &quot;Parkelj&quot; or Krampus who traditionally leaves a rod, an instrument their parents will use to discipline them.

In Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia, Ukraine and Romania, children typically leave their cleaned boots on the windowsill on the evening before St. Nicholas Day. By next morning Nikolaus (&quot;Szent Miklós&quot; traditionally but more commonly known as &quot;Mikulás&quot; in Hungary or Moș Nicolae (&quot;Sfântul Nicolae&quot;) in Romania) and in Ukraine &quot;Sviatyi Mykolay&quot; leaves candies and gifts (Hungarian: &quot;virgács&quot;, Romanian: &quot;nuielușă&quot;). In Hungary and Croatia he is often accompanied by the &quot;Krampusz&quot;, the frightening helper who is out to take away the bad ones.

In Slovenia, Saint Nikolaus (&quot;Miklavž&quot;) is accompanied by an angel and a devil (&quot;parkelj&quot;) corresponding to the Austrian Krampus.

==== Ukraine ====
In Ukraine, Saint Nicholas (&quot;Mykolai&quot;) visits all children during the night and brings presents on 5–6 December. Before the {{ill|Reform of the church calendar in Ukraine|lt=calendar reform in Ukrainian churches|uk|Реформа церковного календаря в Україні|display=1}}, the holiday was celebrated on {{OldStyleDate|18–19 December||5–6 December}} until 2023. From this day, Ukrainians start preparing for the Christmas holidays. Thus, in the cities and towns of Ukraine, Christmas trees are traditionally opened on Saint Nicholas Day.

In Ukraine, the image of Saint Nicholas (Sviatyi &quot;Mykolai&quot;) and the tradition of giving gifts are being revived. Also, the tradition of caring for the needy is increasingly respected: both in the form of charity events in church communities and in secular charitable projects. In schools, on the eve of the holiday, lessons are held where children are taught to write a letter to Saint Nicholas.

On this day, some public organizations hold traditional charity events for orphans. So, every year in Lviv, the campaign &quot;{{ill|Mykolai will not forget about you!|lt=|uk|Миколай про тебе не забуде!|display=1}}&quot; takes place: the city organizes the &quot;Saint Nicholas Factory&quot;, where residents bring gifts and donations for orphans; campaign activists distribute them to children in the evenings of 18 and 19 December. Every year, Plast collects every chicken and prepares a large program for orphans and disabled children.

On 6 June 2006, President Viktor Yushchenko signed Decree No. 481/2006 &quot;On measures to revive traditional folk art and folk arts and crafts in Ukraine&quot;, which includes, in particular, working out the issue of creating the &quot;St. Nicholas Manor&quot; complex in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast with the Building works of folk masters of the National Union of Masters of Folk Art of Ukraine. In 2010, President Viktor Yanukovych instructed the government to provide in the state budget for 2011 funds for the construction of the Estate of Saint Nicholas in the Hutsulshchyna National Park.

In 2018, the {{ill|Big Hand Films|lt=|uk|Big Hand Films|display=1}} company, with the financial support of Derzhkino, released the film directed by {{ill|Semen Horov|lt=|uk|Семен Горов|display=1}}, &quot;{{ill|The Adventures of S Nicholas|lt=|uk|Пригоди S Миколая|display=1}}&quot;. The film tells about the faith of modern children in a good wizard who comes with gifts on the night before Saint Nicholas Day.

====France====

Even though &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; is a Christmas traditional figure across all the French territory, the important celebrations on 6 December are limited to Alsace, the French Low Countries, the French Ardennes, Franche-Comté, the Argonne and Lorraine, where he is patron. This day can be celebrated in some villages of other regions. A little donkey carries baskets filled with children&#x27;s gifts, biscuits and sweets. The whole family gets ready for the saint&#x27;s arrival on 6 December, with grandparents telling stories of the saint. The most popular one (also the subject of a popular French children&#x27;s song) is of three children who wandered away and got lost. Cold and hungry, a wicked butcher lured them into his shop where he killed them and salted them away in a large tub. Through Saint Nicolas&#x27; help the boys were revived and returned to their families, earning him a reputation as protector of children. The evil butcher has followed Saint Nicolas in penance ever since as Père Fouettard. In France, statues and paintings often portray this event, showing the saint with children in a barrel.

Bakeries and home kitchens are hives of activity as spiced gingerbread biscuits and &quot;mannala&quot; (a brioche shaped like the saint) are baked. In schools, children learn songs and poems and create arts and crafts about Saint Nicolas, while in nursery schools, a man portraying Saint Nicolas gives away chocolates and sometimes little presents. He is sometimes accompanied by an actor playing Père Fouettard, who, like his German counterpart Krampus, carries switches to threaten the children who fear he will advise Saint Nicolas to pass them by on his gift-giving rounds.

In Alsace, Lorraine, Argonne and in the countryside of Montbéliard &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; is accompanied by the &quot;Père Fouettard&quot;, but the character of the &quot;Père Fouettard&quot; is well known across all the French territory. He is sometimes also present in the French Ardennes. In Alsace and in Franconian Lorraine &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; is also accompanied by the &quot;Christkind&quot;. In the historically French Flemish-speaking town of Dunkirk, &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; is the companion of the Saint.

====Western Central Europe====
{{anchor|Germany}}
In Northern Germany, &quot;Sankt Nikolaus&quot; is usually celebrated on a small scale. Many children put a boot called &quot;Nikolaus-Stiefel&quot; &quot;(Nikolaus boot)&quot; outside the front door on the night of 5 December. Saint Nicholas fills the boot with gifts and sweets overnight, and at the same time checks up on the children to see if they were good, polite and helpful the last year. If they were not, they will have a stick (&quot;eine Rute&quot;) in their boots instead. Nicholas is often portrayed in Northern German folklore as being accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht who inquires of the children if they have been saying their prayers, and if not, he shakes his bag of ashes at them, or beats them with a stick. 
Sometimes a Nikolaus impersonator also visits the children at school or in their homes and asks them if they have been good (sometimes ostensibly checking his golden book for their record), handing out presents on the basis of their behavior. This has become more lenient in recent decades, and this task is often taken over by the &quot;Weihnachtsmann&quot; (Father Christmas). In more Catholic regions, Saint Nikolaus is dressed very much like a bishop, rides on a horse, and is welcomed at public places by large crowds. He has a long beard, and loves children, except when they have been naughty. This tradition has been kept alive annually.

{{anchor|Poland}}
In Poland &quot;Mikołaj&quot; is often also accompanied by an angel (&quot;anděl&quot; / &quot;anjel&quot; / &quot;anioł&quot; / &quot;anhel&quot;) who acts as a counterweight to the ominous &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;Knecht Ruprecht&quot; (&quot;czart&quot;). Poland and in Slovakia children find the candy and small gifts under the pillow, in their shoes or behind the window the evening of 5 December or the morning of 6 December.

{{anchor|Austria}}
In Austria, Bavaria and South-Tyrol (Austro-Bavarian regions), Saint Nicholas is accompanied by Krampus, represented as a beast-like creature, generally demonic in appearance. Krampus is thought to punish children during the Yule season who had misbehaved, and to capture particularly naughty children in his sack and carry them away to his lair.
The tradition of Krampus was adapted by Czechs and Slovaks during the Austrian-Hungarian era. In addition, in Czechia and Slovakia Saint Nicholas is accompanied by an angel. In Czechia and Slovakia children receive some candies for their good deeds from Saint Nicholas (Mikuláš) and potatoes or coal from Chort (čert) for their sins. 
The creature has roots in Slavic folklore; however, its influence has spread far beyond German borders, in Austria, southern Bavaria, South Tyrol, northern Friuli, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Croatia. 5 December is &quot;Krampus Night&quot; or &quot;Krampusnacht&quot;, in which the hairy devil appears on the streets. Traditionally young men dress up as the Krampus during the first week of December, particularly on the evening of 5 December (the eve of Saint Nichola Day on many church calendars), and roam the streets frightening children with rusty chains and bells. Sometimes accompanying Saint Nicholas and sometimes on his own, Krampus visits homes and businesses. The Saint usually appears in the Eastern Rite vestments of a bishop, and he carries a ceremonial staff. Nicholas dispenses gifts, while Krampus supplies coal and the &quot;ruten&quot; bundles.
Krampus is featured on holiday greeting cards called Krampuskarten. There are many names for Krampus, as well as many regional variations in portrayal and celebration. 

{{anchor|Switzerland}}

In Swiss folklore, Saint Nicholas is known as &quot;Samichlaus&quot; (like Dutch Sinterklaas a corruption of the name of Saint Nicholas). He is accompanied by the &quot;Schmutzli&quot; a frightening helper wearing a brown monk&#x27;s habit. The Christmas gift-bringer is not &quot;Samichlaus&quot;, but the Christchindli.

====Italy====

Saint Nicholas (&quot;San Nicola&quot;) is the patron of the city of Bari, where it is believed he is buried. Its deeply felt celebration is called the &quot;Festa di San Nicola&quot;, held on 7–9 May. In particular on 8 May the relics of the saint are carried on a boat on the sea in front of the city with many boats following (&quot;Festa a mare&quot;). As Saint Nicholas is said to protect children and virgins, on 6 December there is a ritual called the &quot;Rito delle nubili&quot;: unmarried women wishing to find a husband can attend to an early-morning Mass, in which they have to turn around a column seven times. A similar tradition is currently observed in Sassari, where during the day of Saint Nicholas, patron of the city, gifts are given to young women who need help to get married.

In the provinces of Trieste, Udine, Belluno, Bari (Terlizzi and Molfetta), South Tyrol, Trentino and in the eastern part of the Province of Treviso, St. Nicholas (&quot;San Niccolò&quot;) is celebrated with gifts given to children on the morning of 6 December and with a fair called &quot;Fiera di San Niccolò&quot; during the first weeks of December. Depending on the cultural background, in some families this celebration is more important than Christmas.

Like in Austria, in South Tyrol Saint Nicholas comes with krampuses. Instead, in Val Canale (Udine) Saint Nicholas comes to chase the krampuses: after a parade of krampuses running after people, Saint Nicholas comes on a chariot and give gifts to children (Video &quot;San Nicolò caccia i Krampus a Tarvisio&quot; 6.12.2010)

====Malta====

In Suhuan, Saint Nicholas ({{langx|mt|San Nikola}}, less commonly &quot;San Niklaw&quot;) is the patron saint of the town of Siġġiewi where his feast is celebrated on the last Sunday in June. The parish church, dedicated to the saint, was built between 1676 and 1693. It was designed by the Maltese architect, Lorenzo Gafà, with the portico and naves being added by Nikola Zammit in the latter half of the 19th century. The ruins of a former parish church are still visible and have recently undergone restoration.
====Portugal====
{{Main|Nicolinas}}
In Portugal only the city of Guimarães has festivities directed to Saint Nicholas (&quot;São Nicolau&quot;), and it has been like that since the Middle Ages, because Saint Nicholas is deemed as the patron saint of the students of the city.

The collection of festivities in honor of Saint Nicholas are called Nicolinas, and they occur from 29 November to 7 December every year. These celebration are exclusive to this city, but bring people from all over the country to watch these centuries-old festivities, not seen anywhere else in the world.

====Orthodox Slavic countries====

Nikoljdan ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Никољдан}}; {{langx|bg|Никулден|Nikulden}}; {{langx|ru|Никола Зимний|Nikola Zimniy}}; {{langx|uk|
Cвятий Миколай|Sviatyy Mykolay}}) is the patron saint day (&quot;Krsna Slava&quot;, or &quot;Krsno ime&quot;, a Serb tradition) of Saint Nicholas, celebrated on 6 December (Gregorian calendar, 19 December on Julian). Since the feast of Saint Nicholas always falls in the fasting period preceding the Christmas, the feast is celebrated according to the Eastern Orthodox Church fasting rules (&quot;Post&quot;). Fasting refers in this context to the eating of a restricted diet (no animal products or dairy products etc.), such as fish (see Eastern Orthodox fasting).

====Spain====

Saint Nicholas (&quot;San Nicolás&quot;) is the patron of the city of Alicante. The Co-Cathedral of St. Nicholas of Bari is located there.

===Middle East===

====Lebanon====

Saint Nicholas is celebrated by all the Christian communities in Lebanon: Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Armenian. Many places, churches, convents, and schools are named in honor of Saint Nicholas, such as &quot;Escalier Saint-Nicolas des Arts&quot;, Saint Nicolas Garden, and Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral.

===North America===
In the 17th century, Dutch Protestants who settled in New York brought the Sinterklaas tradition with them. While feasts of Saint Nicholas are not observed nationally, cities with strong German influences like Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Evansville, Indiana, Teutopolis, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Fredericksburg, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; St. Louis, Missouri; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania celebrate Saint Nicholas Day on a scale similar to the German custom.

Still practiced in some areas today, children place freshly polished shoes in front of doors, under windows, or at the foot of their beds before heading to bed. 
On the morning of 6 December, they find their shoes filled with gifts and sugary treats. Widespread adoption of the tradition has spread among the German, Polish, Belgian, and Dutch communities throughout the United States. Americans who celebrate Saint Nicholas Day generally also celebrate Christmas Day (25 December) as a separate holiday. Some of the traditions and rituals of Christmas, such as leaving out a stocking to be filled, are similar to the traditions of Saint Nicholas Day.

<text>The Great Mosque of Djenné in the Sudano-Sahelian architectural style is the largest adobe brick building in the world. The mosque is located in the city of Djenné, Mali, on the flood plain of the Bani River. The first mosque on the site was built around the 13th century, but the current structure dates from 1907. As well as being the centre of the community of Djenné, it is one of the most famous landmarks in Africa. Along with the &quot;Old Towns of Djenné&quot;, it was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.

==History==

===The First Mosque===
The actual date of construction of the first mosque in Djenné is unknown, but dates as early as 1200 and as late as 1330 have been suggested. The earliest document mentioning the mosque is Abd al-Sadi&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; which gives the early history, presumably from the oral tradition as it existed in the mid-seventeenth century. The &quot;Tarikh&quot; states that a Sultan Kunburu became a Muslim and had his palace pulled down and the site turned into a mosque. He built another palace for himself near the mosque on the east side. His immediate successor built the towers of the mosque while the following Sultan built the surrounding wall.

There is no other written information on the Great Mosque until the French explorer René Caillié visited Djenné in 1828, years after it had been allowed to fall into ruin, and wrote &quot;In Jenné is a mosque built of earth, surmounted by two massive but not high towers; it is rudely constructed, though very large. It is abandoned to thousands of swallows, which build their nests in it. This occasions a very disagreeable smell, to avoid which, the custom of saying prayers in a small outer court has become common.&quot;
===Seku Amadu&#x27;s mosque===

Ten years before René Caillié&#x27;s visit, the Fulani leader Seku Amadu had launched his jihad and conquered the town. Seku Amadu appears to have disapproved of the existing mosque and allowed it to fall into disrepair. This would have been the building that Caillié saw. Seku Amadu had also closed all the small neighbourhood mosques. Between 1834 and 1836, Seku Amadu built a new mosque to the east of the existing one on the site of the former palace. The new mosque was a large, low building, lacking any towers or ornamentation.
French forces led by Louis Archinard captured Djenné in April 1893. Soon after, the French journalist Félix Dubois visited the town and described the ruins of the original mosque. At the time of his visit, the interior of the ruined mosque was being used as a cemetery. In his 1897 book, &quot;Tombouctou la Mystérieuse&quot; (&quot;Timbuktu the mysterious&quot;), Dubois provides a plan and a drawing as to how he imagined the mosque looked before being abandoned.

===Present mosque===
In 1906, the town arranged for the original mosque to be rebuilt and for a school to be constructed on the site of Seku Amadu&#x27;s mosque, the rebuilding was completed in 1907 using forced labour under the direction of Ismaila Traoré, head of Djenné&#x27;s guild of masons. From photographs taken at the time, it appears the position of at least some of the outer walls follows those of the original mosque but it is unclear whether the columns supporting the roof kept to the previous arrangement. What was almost certainly novel in the rebuilt mosque was the symmetric arrangement of three large towers in the &quot;qibla&quot; wall. There has been debate about to what extent the design of the rebuilt mosque was subject to French influence, although it is unlikely that French engineers worked on the building at all. 
Dubois revisited Djenné in 1910 and was shocked by the reconstructed mosque. He believed that the French colonial administration were responsible for the design and wrote that it looked like a cross between a hedgehog and a church organ. He thought that the cones made the building resemble a baroque temple dedicated to the god of suppositories. By contrast, Jean-Louis Bourgeois has argued that the French had little influence except perhaps for the internal arches and that the design is &quot;basically African.&quot; Ismaila Traoré head of Djenne&#x27;s guild of masons and renowned throughout the Sahel, was the architect for the reconstruction of the Djenné mosque. 

French ethnologist Michel Leiris, in his account of travelling through Mali in 1931, states that the new mosque is indeed the work of Europeans. He also says that local people were so unhappy with the reconstructed building that they refused to clean it, only doing so when threatened with prison. Jean-Louis Bourgeois however, recorded that the rebuilt mosque was constructed by Djenné&#x27;s traditional local guild of masons, traditionally responsible for the building and maintenance of the town&#x27;s original mosque and of Djenné&#x27;s other buildings, using traditional techniques and with minimal French involvement. A problem concerning the mosque arose from Djenné&#x27;s local politics: most of the city&#x27;s inhabitants – including the Islamic elite who were harassed by Seku Amadu and humiliated by the destruction of the old mosque – wanted an exact rebuilding of the old mosque in their vision. 

The terrace in front of the eastern wall includes two tombs. The larger tomb to the south contains the remains of Almany Ismaïla, an important &quot;imam&quot; of the 18th century. Early in the French colonial period, a pond located on the eastern side of the mosque was filled with earth to create the open area that is now used for the weekly market.

Electrical wiring and indoor plumbing have been added to many mosques in Mali. In some cases, the original surfaces of mosques have even been tiled over, destroying their historical appearances and in some cases compromising the building&#x27;s structural integrity. While the Great Mosque has been equipped with a loudspeaker system, the citizens of Djenné have resisted modernization in favor of the building&#x27;s historical integrity. Many historical preservationists have praised the community&#x27;s preservation effort, and interest in this aspect of the building grew in the 1990s.

The mosque is seen in the 2005 film &quot;Sahara&quot;.

== Design ==
The walls of the Great Mosque are made of sun-baked earth bricks (called &quot;ferey&quot;), and sand and earth-based mortar, and are coated with a plaster which gives the building its smooth, sculpted look. The walls of the building are decorated with bundles of rodier palm (&quot;Borassus aethiopum&quot;) sticks, called &quot;toron&quot;, that project about from the surface. The &quot;toron&quot; also serve as readymade scaffolding for the annual repairs. Ceramic half-pipes also extend from the roofline and direct rain water from the roof away from the walls.

The mosque is built on a platform measuring about that is raised by above the level of the marketplace. The platform prevents damage to the mosque when the Bani River floods. It is accessed by six sets of stairs, each decorated with pinnacles. The main entrance is on the northern side of the building. The outer walls of the Great Mosque are not precisely orthogonal to one another so that the plan of the building has a noticeable trapezoidal outline.

The prayer wall or &quot;qibla&quot; of the Great Mosque faces east towards Mecca and overlooks the city marketplace. The &quot;qibla&quot; is dominated by three large, box-like towers or minarets jutting out from the main wall. The central tower is around 16 metres in height. The cone shaped spires or pinnacles at the top of each minaret are topped with ostrich eggs. The eastern wall is about a metre (3ft) in thickness and is strengthened on the exterior by eighteen pilaster like buttresses, each of which is topped by a pinnacle. The corners are formed by rectangular-shaped buttresses decorated with &quot;toron&quot; and topped by pinnacles.

The prayer hall, measuring about , occupies the eastern half of the mosque behind the &quot;qibla&quot; wall. The mud-covered, rodier-palm roof is supported by nine interior walls running north–south which are pierced by pointed arches that reach up almost to the roof. This design creates a forest of ninety massive rectangular pillars that span the interior prayer hall and severely reduce the field of view. The small, irregularly-positioned windows on the north and south walls allow little natural light to reach the interior of the hall. The floor is composed of sandy earth.

In the prayer hall, each of the three towers in the &quot;qibla&quot; wall has a niche or &quot;mihrab&quot;. The &quot;imam&quot; conducts the prayers from the &quot;mihrab&quot; in the larger central tower. A narrow opening in the ceiling of the central &quot;mihrab&quot; connects with a small room situated above roof level in the tower. In earlier times, a crier would repeat the words of the &quot;imam&quot; to people in the town. To the right of the &quot;mihrab&quot; in the central tower is a second niche, the pulpit or &quot;minbar&quot;, from which the &quot;imam&quot; preaches his Friday sermon.

The towers in the &quot;qibla&quot; wall do not contain stairs linking the prayer hall with the roof. Instead there are two square towers housing stairs leading to the roof. One set of stairs is located at the southwestern corner of the prayer hall while the other set, situated near the main entrance on the northern side, is only accessible from the exterior of the mosque. Small vents in the roof are topped with removable inverted kiln-fired bowls, which when removed allow hot air to rise out of the building and so ventilate the interior.

The interior courtyard to the west of the prayer hall, measuring , is surrounded on three sides by galleries. The walls of the galleries facing the courtyard are punctuated by arched openings. The western gallery is reserved for use by women.

Though it benefits from regular maintenance, since the facade&#x27;s construction in 1907, only small changes have been made to the design. Rather than a single central niche, the &quot;mihrab&quot; tower originally had a pair of large recesses echoing the form of the entrance arches in the north wall. The mosque also had many fewer &quot;toron&quot; with none on the corner buttresses. It is evident from published photographs that two additional rows of &quot;toron&quot; were added to the walls in the early 1990s.

== Cultural significance ==

The entire community of Djenné takes an active role in the mosque&#x27;s maintenance during an annual festival. This includes music and food, but is mainly to repair the damage inflicted on the mosque in the past year (mostly erosion caused by the annual rains and cracks caused by changes in temperature and humidity). In the days before the festival, the plaster is prepared in pits. It requires several days to cure but needs to be periodically stirred, a task usually falling to young boys who play in the mixture, thus stirring up the contents. Men climb onto the mosque&#x27;s built-in scaffolding and ladders made of palm wood and smear the plaster over the face of the mosque.

Another group of men carries the plaster from the pits to the workmen on the mosque. A race is held at the beginning of the festival to see who will be the first to deliver the plaster to the mosque. Women and girls carry water to the pits before the festival and to the workmen on the mosque during it. Members of Djenné&#x27;s masons guild direct the work, while elderly members of the community, who have already participated in the festival many times, sit in a place of honour in the market square watching the proceedings.

In 1930, an inexact replica of the mosque was built in the town of Fréjus in southern France. The imitation, the Missiri mosque, was built in cement and painted in red ochre to resemble the colour of the original. It was intended to serve as a mosque for the &quot;Tirailleurs sénégalais&quot;, the West African colonial troops in the French Army who were posted to the region during the winter.
The original mosque presided over one of the most important Islamic learning centers in Africa during the Middle Ages, with thousands of students coming to study the Quran in Djenné&#x27;s madrassas. The historic areas of Djenné, including the Great Mosque, were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. While there are many mosques that are older than its current incarnation, the Great Mosque remains the most prominent symbol of both the city of Djenné and the nation of Mali.

On 20 January 2006, the sight of a team of men hacking at the roof of the mosque sparked a riot in the town. The team were inspecting the roof as part of a restoration project financed by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. The men quickly disappeared to avoid being lynched. In the mosque the mob ripped out the ventilation fans that had been presented by the US Embassy at the time of the Iraq War and then went on a rampage through the town. The crowd ransacked the Cultural Mission, the mayor&#x27;s home, destroyed the car belonging to the imam&#x27;s younger brother and damaged three cars belonging to the Imam himself. The local police were overwhelmed and had to call in reinforcements from Mopti. One man died during the disturbances.

On Thursday 5 November 2009, the upper section of the southern large tower of the &quot;qibla&quot; wall collapsed after 75mm (3 inches) of rain had fallen in a 24-hour period. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture funded the rebuilding of the tower.

The mosque features on the coat of arms of Mali.

== 3D documentation with laser-scanning ==
The 3D documentation of the Djenné Mosque was carried out in 2005 using terrestrial laser-scanning. This formed part of the Zamani Project that aims to document cultural heritage sites in 3D to create a record for future generations.
==Video games==
The mosque is a Wonder Building in the historical strategy games &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization V&quot;, &quot;Age of Empires II&quot;, and &quot;Age of Empires IV&quot;.

<doc id="705176" wikidata="Q161085" url="?curid=705176" title="Artocarpus">
<text>Artocarpus is a genus of approximately 60 trees and shrubs of Southeast Asian and Pacific origin, belonging to the mulberry family, Moraceae. Most species of &quot;Artocarpus&quot; are restricted to Southeast Asia; a few cultivated species are more widely distributed, especially &quot;A. altilis&quot; (breadfruit) and &quot;A. heterophyllus&quot; (jackfruit), which are cultivated throughout the tropics.

== Description ==
All &quot;Artocarpus&quot; species are laticiferous trees or shrubs that are composed of leaves, twigs and stems capable of producing a milky sap. The flora type is monoecious and produces unisexual flowers; furthermore, both sexes are present within the same plant. The plants produce small, greenish, female flowers that grow on short, fleshy spikes. Following pollination, the flowers grow into a syncarpous fruit, and these are capable of growing into very large sizes. The stipulated leaves vary from small and entire (&quot;Artocarpus integer&quot;) to large and lobed (&quot;Artocarpus altilis&quot;), with the cordate leaves of the species &quot;A. altilis&quot; ending in long, sharp tips.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;Artocarpus&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;artos&quot; (&quot;bread&quot;) and &quot;karpos&quot; (&quot;fruit&quot;). This name was coined by Johann Reinhold Forster and J. Georg Adam Forster, a father-and-son team of botanists aboard HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; on James Cook&#x27;s second voyage; they used it in their book &quot;Characteres generum plantarum&quot;. It is maintained as a conserved name.

Although fossils of &quot;Artocarpus&quot; have been reported from as early as the Late Cretaceous, these fossils generally that lack key diagnostic characters such as that could definitively place them in the genus. The last common ancestor of all living &quot;Artocarpus&quot; likely originated in the vicinity of Borneo, from which &quot;Artocarpus&quot; dispersed elsewhere in Asia and Oceania.

===Subgenera===
Recent phylogenetic research, based on leaf arrangement, leaf anatomical characters and stipules, indicates that there are at least two subgenera in &quot;Artocarpus&quot;:
*Subgenus &quot;Artocarpus&quot;: Perianth of fruit is partially connate (fused).
*Subgenus &quot;Pseudojaca&quot;: Perianth is entirely connate.
*Subgenus &quot;Cauliflori&quot;
Subgenus &quot;Pseudojaca&quot; is allied to the genus &quot;Prainea&quot;, and some researchers treat this taxon as a fourth subgenus of &quot;Artocarpus&quot;.

==== Extant species ====

==Fossil record==
Fossil leaves and fruits of †&quot;Artocarpus dicksoni&quot; have been found in Cretaceous formations of West Greenland. Fossil leaves of †&quot;Artocarpus ordinarius&quot; have been found in Cretaceous stratum at the south bank of the Yukon River just above Rampart, Alaska. Fossils of †&quot;Artocarpus californica&quot; have been described from Eocene and Miocene strata of the Pacific coast of California and Oregon. 8 fossil species of &quot;Artocarpus&quot; (†&quot;A. capellinii&quot;, †&quot;A. isseli&quot;, †&quot;A. macrophylla&quot;, †&quot;A. massalongoi&quot;, †&quot;A. multinervis&quot;, †&quot;A. ovalifolia&quot;, †&quot;A. sismondai&quot; and †&quot;A. taramellii&quot;) from the lower Oligocene, have been described from a fossil leaves collected from 1857 to 1889 in Santa Giustina and Sassello in Central Liguria, Italy.

==Uses==
Several species in the genus bear edible fruit and are commonly cultivated: Breadfruit (&quot;Artocarpus altilis&quot;), Cempedak (&quot;Artocarpus integer&quot;), Jackfruit (&quot;Artocarpus heterophyllus&quot;), Kwai Muk (&quot;Artocarpus parvus&quot;), Lakoocha (&quot;Artocarpus lakoocha&quot;), Pudau (&quot;Artocarpus kemando&quot;), &quot;Anjily&quot; (a.k.a. Jungle Jack) (&quot;Artocarpus hirsutus&quot;), Chaplaish (&quot;Artocarpus chama&quot;), and Marang (&quot;Artocarpus odoratissimus&quot;).

Breadfruit and jackfruit are cultivated widely in the tropical Southeast Asia. Other species are cultivated locally for their timber, fruit or edible seeds. Anjily, &quot;A. hirsutus&quot;, is grown for fruit and timber in the Western Ghats.

It changed its name to Future New Zealand in 1998 and contested the 1999 election. It formed a coalition with the United Party as United Future New Zealand in 2000 and contested the 2002 election. The coalition became a full merger the following year.

The Christian Democrats were founded by Graeme Lee, a National Party MP. Lee had a reputation as one of the more conservative MPs in Parliament, and was particularly active in opposing Fran Wilde&#x27;s homosexual law reform bill. When the Christian Heritage Party, a strongly conservative group, was established, Lee initially rejected it, believing that it was better to work from within the National Party. Later, however, when he lost his ministerial rank in a Cabinet reshuffle, Lee decided to leave National. Although there were attempts to have him join Christian Heritage, Lee disagreed with many Christian Heritage policies. He instead established a group called the United Progressive Party. After a failed attempt to merge the United Progressive Party with Christian Heritage, it was relaunched on 17 May 1995 under the name &quot;Christian Democrats&quot;.

Talks between the Christian Democrats and Christian Heritage continued, with many people believing that a united front was the only way for the Christian conservative movement to be successful. There were, however, significant policy differences between the two parties. One major problem was Christian Heritage&#x27;s &quot;confessional&quot; nature, which meant that only Christians could join the party. Graeme Lee and the Christian Democrats, by contrast, preferred to make their party &quot;values-based&quot;, saying that anyone who shared the basic Christian moral outlook (whether actually Christian or not) should be able to participate. The two parties also disagreed on a number of other points, with the Christian Democrats generally being more moderate than Christian Heritage.

Eventually, however, the two parties agreed to contest the 1996 election as a single bloc. The resultant Christian Coalition was announced on 29 March 1996. Throughout the existence of the Coalition, however, there were tensions between the two parties – the Christian Democrats accused Christian Heritage of extremism and inflexibility, while Christian Heritage accused the Christian Democrats of putting political pragmatism before Christian morality. The Coalition received 4.33% of the votes, a little short of the 5% which would have given it seats in Parliament, and it collapsed soon afterwards, with both sides accusing each other of having held the Coalition back.

==Future New Zealand and United Future==
Shortly after the Coalition collapsed, Graeme Lee stepped down as leader of the Christian Democrats, having decided some time earlier to retire if the Coalition was not successful. After a considerable period of time, Anthony Walton was selected as the party&#x27;s new leader. Walton took the party even further away from the confessionalism of Christian Heritage, abandoning the explicitly religious nature of the party in favour of a broader &quot;values-based&quot; platform. It changed its name to Future New Zealand in November 1998 and contested the 1999 election, gaining 1.12% of the votes and no seats.

Future New Zealand joined with the United Party to form a coalition known as United Future New Zealand in November 2000 and contested the 2002 election as such. The joint parties polled strongly, gaining eight seats in Parliament. The coalition became a full merger in 2003.

Only one founding member of the Christian Democrats, Murray Smith, became a United Future MP, so there has been debate as to how much of the Christian Democrats remained in the modern party. One side of this debate argues that United Future list MPs Larry Baldock, Bernie Ogilvy and Paul Adams all had involvement with evangelical organisations, such as Youth with a Mission, the Masters Institute in Auckland, and City Impact Church, and while they may not have been Christian Democrats, they were conservative Christian political activists and community figures before their entry to Parliament. Over and over again, United Future voted against socially liberal legislation in Parliament, or else supported socially conservative private members bills. These included the Prostitution Law Reform Act 2003, Care of Children Act 2004, Civil Union Act 2004, Relationships (Statutory References) Act 2005 and Death With Dignity Bill 2004, which they opposed. Murray Smith sponsored an unsuccessful private members bill which would have required parental notification before an abortion could be performed, which did not pass. Although a conservative Catholic, Gordon Copeland has frequently cited the work of organisations such as the Society for Promotion of Community Standards and Right to Life New Zealand as a basis for comments against the Prostitution Law Reform Act, and himself introduced an attempt to ban same-sex marriage into the 48th New Zealand Parliament on 7 December 2005.

In February 2006, Copeland submitted an anti-abortion private members ballot bill into the 48th Parliament, entitled the Contraception, Sterilisation and Abortion (Informed Consent) Bill. This bill would ensure that women give informed consent before undergoing an abortion of their unborn child.

<text>Ding Ling (; October 12, 1904 – March 4, 1986), formerly romanized as Ting Ling, was the pen name of Jiang Bingzhi (), also known as Bin Zhi (彬芷 &quot;Bīn Zhǐ&quot;), one of the most celebrated Chinese women authors of the 20th century. She is known for her feminist and socialist realist literature.

Ding was active in leftist literary circles connected to the Chinese Communist Party and was imprisoned by the Chinese Nationalist Party for her politics. She later became a leader in the literary community in the Communist base of Yan&#x27;an, and held high literature and culture positions in the early government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. She was awarded the Soviet Union&#x27;s Stalin second prize for Literature in 1951 for her socialist-realist work &quot;The Sun Shines Over Sanggan River&quot;. After the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1958, Ding was denounced and purged and was sent to exile in Manchuria, to be rehabilitated only in 1979. She died in Beijing in 1986.

==Early life==
Ding Ling was born as Jiang Bingzhi into a gentry family in Linli, Hunan province. Her father, Jiang Baoqian, was a scholar in the late Qing Dynasty and died when Ding Ling was 3 years old. Ding Ling&#x27;s mother, Yu Manzhen, studied at the Hunan Provincial No. 1 Normal School for Girls where she was a classmate of Xiang Jingyu, an early pioneer in Chinese feminism. She later became an elementary school educator who raised her children as a single mother. Ding Ling&#x27;s mother was Ding&#x27;s role model, and she would later write an unfinished novel, titled &quot;Mother&quot;, describing her mother&#x27;s experiences. Following her mother&#x27;s example, Ding Ling became an activist at an early age.

Ding Ling had her formative education in progressive girls&#x27; schools, first in Hunan and later in Shanghai. In 1919, Ding Ling graduated from primary school and was admitted to the preparatory course at the Hunan Second Normal School for Girls in Taoyuan County, where she came in contact with the May 4th student movement. In 1920, she was transferred to Changsha Zhounan Girls High School, but the school became very conservative and Ding dropped out after one year of study. In 1921, Ding transferred to Yueyun Middle School and was a classmate with Yang Kaihui, Mao Zedong&#x27;s second wife.

In the summer of 1922, Ding&#x27;s friend Wang Jianhong returned home from Shanghai and took Ding to Shanghai, where she entered the CCP-run People&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School. During this time she took up the pen name Ding Ling. In 1923, she and Wang Jianhong attended the Chinese Department of Shanghai University. In 1924, Wang and her teacher, famed CCP literary figure Qu Qiubai fell in love and started living together. Ding Ling went to Beijing alone in the summer to study at Peking University, but to no avail.

Through her roommate Cao Mengjun&#x27;s boyfriend Zuo Gong, Ding Ling met her future husband Hu Yepin, then editor of the supplement of the Beijing News. When Ding Ling returned to her hometown during summer vacation, Hu Yepin rushed to Hunan. Ding Ling recalled, &quot;Our thoughts, characters, and feelings are different, but his bravery, enthusiasm, stubbornness, optimism and poverty all surprised me... The smooth sintered glass beads had gone up somewhere. So we had a deep friendship right away.” In 1925, Ding Ling and Hu Yepin lived together in Beijing, but as she said, &quot;but we had no husband and wife relationship&quot;, because &quot;I, Ding Ling, did not want to use love or marriage to fetter me; I am a person who wants to be free&quot;.

== Literature and politics ==
In December 1927, Ding Ling wrote and published her first novel &quot;Meng Ke&quot; in Beijing, which was published in the magazine &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot;, describing the struggle of a young woman born in a declining bureaucratic family in Shanghai. The initial concern for women&#x27;s issues was appreciated by editor-in-chief of &quot;Ye Shengtao&quot;.

In February 1928, Ding Ling published &quot;Miss Sophia&#x27;s Diary&quot; in the &quot;Fiction Monthly&quot;. The book, in which a young woman describes her unhappiness with her life and confused romantic and sexual feelings, caused a sensation in the literary world. &quot;Miss Sophia&#x27;s Diary&quot; highlights Ding Ling&#x27;s close association and belief in the New Woman movement which was occurring in China during the 1920s. At this time, Ding Ling and Hu Yepin frequently traveled from Beijing to Shanghai. They lived briefly in Hangzhou from March to July of the same year, and then returned to Shanghai.

Around this time Ding Ling met the Communist Party member, writer, and activist Feng Xuefeng, who unlike Hu Yepin was active in politics. Ding Ling fell in love with Feng, and at the end of February, the three had a long talk in Hangzhou, after which Feng Xuefeng backed out and Ding Ling and Hu Yebin got married and lived in Shanghai. Ding Ling later recalled: &quot;I had lived with Hu Yepin for two and a half years, and I&#x27;d never said that I would agree to marry them, but I also did not reject his feelings for me. He gave me many things; I did not reject them. Although the two of us had an arrangement, we could have broken it off at any time. We were not husband and wife, but other people saw us as husband and wife. When I talked about these feelings, and about reason, all I could do was lose Xuefeng.”

In the summer of 1928, Ding Ling and Hu Yepin as a couple moved from Beijing to Shanghai via Hangzhou, and lived in the Shanghai French Concession. There they founded a publishing house to publish a magazine &quot;Red and Black&quot; together with Shen Congwen. In early 1929, Ding Ling started editing and publishing the &quot;Renjian (Humanity)&quot; magazine, but both magazines ceased publication soon afterward. Ding and Hu were finally broke and lived on the rent sent by Ding Ling&#x27;s mother. In the winter of 1929, Ding Ling completed the novel &quot;Wei Hu (Protection)&quot;, which was based on the love story between Ding Ling&#x27;s friend Wang Jianhong and Communist Party member Qu Qiubai.

In February 1930, Hu Yepin went to Jinan to teach at the Shandong Provincial Senior High School, and Ding Ling joined him soon after. In Jinan, Hu Yepin accepted and began to actively promote Marxism-Leninism, which attracted the attention of the Kuomintang. In May of that year, after learning that Hu Yepin was in danger of arrest, Ding and Hu two fled back to Shanghai and they joined the Communist Party-affiliated League of Left-Wing Writers. In November 1930, Ding&#x27;s son with Hu Yepin born. He was named Jiang Zulin after Ding&#x27;s original surname instead of Hu&#x27;s surname, and was raised by his grandmother.

On January 17, 1931, Hu Yepin was arrested by the Kuomintang government for his association with the Communists and was shot to death near the Longhua temple in Shanghai on February 7. In grief, Ding Ling sent her son who was less than 100 days old back to Hunan to be taken care of by her mother. In May, Ding Ling published her and Hu Yepin&#x27;s joint collection &quot;The Birth of a Man&quot; to commemorate Hu Yepin&#x27;s death. Afterwards, Ding participated in the establishment of the League of Left-Wing Writers publication Beidou (Great Dipper). Ding moved in with translator Feng Da in November. In March 1932, Ding Ling joined the Chinese Communist Party and succeeded Qian Xingcun as the party secretary of the League of Left-Wing Writers.

==Political imprisonment in Nanjing==
In May 1933, together with Feng Da, Ding was arrested by the Kuomintang government and was secretly sent to Nanjing under house arrest. For a long time, the Kuomintang government denied arresting Ding Ling, and many of Ding Ling&#x27;s friends thought she was dead.

In September 1933, under persuasion, Ding Ling wrote the following note: &quot;I was arrested because of a misunderstanding, and I received preferential treatment; I did not go through any trial and punishment. After going out, I will not be active in politics. I only wish to study at home and take care of my mother...&quot;Ding thought that the note would help her regain her freedom but to no avail. (Later, under political investigation by the Communist Party, this note be used to criticize Ding. Some critics would use the note to accuse her of &quot;losing integrity&quot; in 1945, and of &quot;renegade behavior, lack of loyalty and honesty to the party&quot; in 1956 to 1975. In 1979, the conclusion of 1975 was revoked, but the conclusion of 1956 was maintained. Only in 1984 was she fully rehabilitated.)

In April 1934, Feng Da worked as an interpreter in the Kuomintang organization, and the Kuomintang still gave Ding Ling 100 yuan per month for living expenses, so while the two were still under house arrest, they had a little more freedom. Accepting living expenses has also become an issue for Ding Ling&#x27;s political scrutiny in the future. In October 1934, Ding gave birth to her daughter with Feng Da, which also took her surname instead of Feng&#x27;s.

In July 1936, arranged by Feng Xuefeng, Ding fled Nanjing on train and came to Shanghai. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, she escaped from a hiding place at a friend&#x27;s house in Shanghai and arrived in Xi&#x27;an in early October, after which she made her way to the Communist base of Yan&#x27;an the month after.

== Early life in Yan&#x27;an ==
Ding Ling became one of the most influential figures in Yan&#x27;an cultural circles, serving as director of the Chinese Literature and Arts Association and editing a newspaper literary supplement. As arguably the most famous writer who came to the Communist-controlled Yan&#x27;an area from the Kuomintang-controlled area, she initially enjoyed close relations with many top Communist leaders. At the end of 1936, Mao Zedong wrote and dedicated the poem &quot;The Immortal from Linjiang&quot; to her:壁上红旗飘落照，西风漫卷孤城，保安人物一时新，洞中开宴会，招待出牢人，纤笔一支谁与拟，三千毛瑟精兵，阵图开向陇山东，昨日文小姐，今日武将军.

&quot;Gently billowing the red flag on the city wall, the West Wind envelops the lonely city. New men and women suddenly arrive, and a banquet is held in the yaodong caves to receive our released prisoner (Ding Ling). To your elegant brush, who can compare? For your brush is like three thousand crack troops wielding rifles, advancing in formation towards Longshan Mountain. Yesterday you were a literary lady, today you become a martial general.&quot;

Note: In 1922 Sun Yat-Sen made the statement that &quot;A single brush is stronger than three thousand Mauser rifles&quot;.After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ding served as the director of the &quot;Northwest Field Service Corps&quot;, and led wartime anti-Japanese theatre performance tours to the front line from Yan&#x27;an from September 1937 to July 1938. After that, Ding settled in Yan&#x27;an and wrote literary works. At the end of 1939, Ding worked in the Cultural Association of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region

However, in September 1940, because of her experience in Nanjing, Ding came under suspect for surrendering herself to the Kuomintang. She asked the Communist Party to make a review, during which she did not mention the &quot;note&quot; she wrote. The review passed. On October 4, the &quot;Conclusion of the Central Organization Department&#x27;s Review of Comrade Ding Ling&#x27;s Arrest and Ban&quot; stated, &quot;According to the existing materials, there is no concrete proof that Comrade Ding Ling had surrendered himself. Therefore, the legend of surrender cannot be trusted. But Comrade Ding Ling Not taking advantage of the possibility (although there are also concerns) to leave Nanjing early (it should be estimated that living in Nanjing is not good for foreign influence). This kind of disposal is inappropriate. ... Comrade Ding Ling should be considered to be still a loyal party to the revolution. Communist Party&quot;. The last sentence was added by Mao Zedong himself. In May 1941, Ding served as the editor-in-chief of the literary column of &quot;Liberation Daily&quot;, an organ of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

During this time, Ding wrote the following three well known works:

* The short story &quot;When I Was in Xia Village&quot;, published in &quot;Chinese Culture&quot; in June 1941, was adapted from a true story. The story is about a woman forced into prostitution by the Japanese who later joins the Chinese Communist Party as a spy. It criticized the treatment of women within the party and challenged the supposed &#x27;equality&#x27; between men and women that it failed to uphold. Ding Ling said that the heroine Zhenzhen &quot;entrusted her own feelings&quot; because she was &quot;lonely&quot;, &quot;proud&quot; and &quot;tough&quot;.
* The short story &quot;In the Hospital&quot;, published in the &quot;Gu Yu&quot; magazine on November 15, 1941 and was also adapted from a true story. The short story criticized the hardships of a Yan&#x27;an hospital from the perspective of a new nurse. Ding was later criticized for this story for &quot;having the standpoint of a petty-bourgeois intellectual&quot;.
* The essay &quot;Thoughts on March 8&quot;, published in Communist Party newspaper &quot;Liberation Daily&quot; on March 9, 1942, questioning the party&#x27;s commitment to change popular attitudes towards women. Here, Ding satirized male double standards concerning women, saying they were ridiculed if they focused on household duties, but also became the target of gossip and rumors if they remained unmarried and worked in the public sphere. She also criticized male cadres use of divorce provisions to rid themselves of unwanted wives. Her article was condemned by Mao Zedong and the party leadership, and she was forced to retract her views and undergo a public self-confession.

== The Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement ==
In February 1942, the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement started and intellectuals were attacked. The literary and art circles responded immediately. At that time, Ding Ling was the editor of the literature and art column of &quot;Liberation Daily&quot;. This column published a series of defensive articles around March, arguing that there were hierarchical systems and suppression of speech in Yan&#x27;an at that time. These included &quot;The March 8th Festival&quot; (March 9), Ai Qing&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Writers, Respecting Writers&quot; (March 11), Luo Feng&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Essays&quot; (March 12), Wang Shiwei&#x27;s &quot;Age&quot; Wild Lily &quot; (March 13, 23), and Xiao Jun&#x27;s &quot;On the &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Endurance&quot; of Comrades (April 8). These articles were later criticized, and although Ding Ling resigned had resigned by March 12, she was also implicated.

On April 25, Ding Ling wrote &quot;Memories of Xiao Hong in the Wind and Rain&quot;, which was published in June, and which subtly criticized the political climate at Yan&#x27;an.&quot;What is the most terrifying thing in the world? It is by no means difficult and dangerous, it is by no means floods and beasts, and it is by no means desolation and loneliness. What is hard to endure is the gloom and humiliation; the greatness of man is not the ability to ride the wind and the sky to rise, not only to be able to resist the overthrow, but to open up the situation and indicate the light under the pressure of the haze.&quot;On May 2, Mao Zedong criticized Ding Ling at the Yan&#x27;an Forum on Literature and Art: &quot;What problems should be solved in literature and art work? For the Communist Party members, it means to stand on the side of the Party, on the side of the Party&#x27;s nature and the Party&#x27;s policies... One of the basic viewpoints of Marxism is that existence determines consciousness, which is class struggle. The objective reality of national struggle determines our thoughts and feelings. But some of our comrades have turned this question upside down, saying that everything should start from &#x27;love&#x27;.&quot; Since then, a large number of critical articles against Ding Ling and others appeared in the newspapers.

On June 11, under political pressure, Ding Ling criticized fellow writer Wang Shiwei who was purged from the Party. “(Wang Shiwei&#x27;s problem) is no longer a question of ideological methods, but a question of motivation, anti-party ideology and Behavior is a political issue.&quot; Wang would be subject to a struggle session and imprisoned and later executed five years later.

In February 1942, Ding Ling married Chen Ming, the president of Yan&#x27;an Fenghuo Opera Club. Ding Ling was 13 years older than Chen Ming, and the relationship was the source of much discussion.

In 1943, the rectification movement intensified and many more Communist Party members were purged. Ding Ling came under great pressure and was subject to disciplinary review. In 1945, the &quot;Review Team&#x27;s Preliminary Conclusions on Ding Ling&#x27;s Historical Issues&quot; stated: &quot;There are materials to prove that there is no suspicion of Ding being dispatched by the Kuomintang. But whether the serious ideological problems during this period were affected by the softening of the Kuomintang after the arrest, Comrade Ding Ling deeply reflected on himself. After the rectification, there has been progress.” Thus she was spared.

After 1942, Ding Ling entered a low period, and it was not until she wrote &quot;Tian Baolin&quot; in 1944, which was praised by Mao Zedong, that she began to actively create again.

== Land reform and &quot;The Sun Shines Over Sanggan River&quot; ==
In early October 1945, Ding and other Yan&#x27;an writers marched more than 2,000 miles on foot to Zhangjiakou, the then-capital of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Area. During this time she lived in the office of the &quot;Jin-Cha-Ji Daily&quot; and devoted herself to writing. On March 12, 1946, she became the editor of the bimonthly magazine &quot;Northern Culture&quot;, and took up various other literary roles.

In the summer of 1946, land reform came underway in CCP-controlled regions of China, and Ding Ling joined the land reform team organized by the Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau which traveled around various towns in the region to implement land reform in the region. During the land reform, the Chinese Civil War had broken out and Ding had to retreat back to Zhangjiakou and later to Red Earth Mountain in Fuping County.

This experience was the inspiration for Ding&#x27;s primary work during these years, the novel &quot;The Sun Shines Over Sanggan River&quot;, which was completed in 1948. The book was awarded the Stalin prize for Literature in 1951, and is considered one of the best examples of socialist-realist fiction. When recalling the motivation for the creation of this novel, Ding wrote: &quot;Because I have lived with these people and fought together, I love this group of people and this life, and I want to keep them in real life, on paper.&quot;

Unlike the fictionalized village depicted in &quot;The Sun Shines Over Sanggan River&quot; which enjoys its liberation, the village on which Ding based her novel was captured by the Nationalists shortly after Ding&#x27;s land reform work team left. According to Ding, her beloved peasants &quot;suffer[ed] reprisals from despotic landlords&quot; after the village&#x27;s capture.

== Life in the early People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
After 1949, Ding took up several important cultural and literary posts in the new Chinese government. These posts included editor-in-chief of &quot;Literature and Art Newspaper&quot;, the director of the Central Literature Research Institute, the director of the Literature and Art Department of the CCP Propaganda Bureau, the party secretary and vice chairman of the Chinese Writers&#x27; Association, the editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#x27;s Literature&quot;, and the deputy secretary of the party group of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

In 1949 and 1950, Ding criticized the base tastes of much popular literature, but also recognized that revolutionary literature was not yet well-developed. She called for the rejection of &quot;the vulgar and outmoded butterfly literature style,&quot; but also emphasized that it was necessary to &quot;do research on the interests of readers&quot; in order to &quot;keep[] the masses in mind.&quot; Ding favored worker-peasant-soldier literature and art but recognized that this form was &quot;not yet very mature.&quot;

In 1954, Ding was awarded the second prize of the Soviet State Prize for Literature for &quot;The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River&quot;, and in 1954, Ding was elected to the PRC&#x27;s first National People&#x27;s Congress.

== Purge and exile ==
In 1955, Ding&#x27;s former League of Left-Wing Writers colleague Hu Feng, who helped her escape from Nanjing to Shanghai in 1936, underwent a massive purge, with claims that he was leading a &quot;Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique&quot;. Under the political climate, Ding criticized Hu in a critical article &quot;Where Do Enemies Come From&quot;, which was published in the People&#x27;s Daily on May 23, 1955, No. 3. Hu was later sentenced to prison for 14 years and would not be rehabilitated until 1979.

Soon, Ding Ling herself was criticized. In July 1955, Lu Dingyi wrote an article accusing Ding of &quot;liberalism and individualism&quot;, and in August, she was designated as the leader member of the &quot;Ding Ling and Chen Qixia Anti-Party Small Group&quot;. Ding was expelled from the Communist Party on December 6.

In 1957 the Anti-Rightist Campaign started. Because Ding authorized the publication of Wang Shiwei&#x27;s &quot;Wild Lily Flower&quot; in Yan&#x27;an, she was designated as a rightist, and was disqualified from the National People&#x27;s Congress in February 1958.

On January 26, 1958, Ding Ling was denounced in a special edition of &quot;Re-Criticism&quot; published by the government &quot;Literature and Art Newspaper&quot;. Mao Zedong personally edited the note and criticized Ding Ling and other writers by name many times, calling to mind the note she wrote while in Nanjing: &quot;What are you to criticize again? Wang Shiwei&#x27;s &quot;Criticism&quot; Wild Lily, Ding Ling&#x27;s &quot;Feelings of the March 8th Festival&quot;, Xiao Jun&#x27;s &quot;On the &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Endurance&quot; of Comrades, Luo Feng&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Essays&quot;, Ai Qing&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Writers and Respecting Writers&quot; , and several others. The above-mentioned articles were all published in the literary and artistic supplement of the &quot;Liberation Daily&quot; in Yan&#x27;an. Ding Ling and Chen Qixia presided over this supplement. Ding Ling&#x27;s novel &quot;When in the Hospital&quot; was published in 1941 in The Yan&#x27;an literary publication &quot;Gu Yu&quot; was renamed &quot;In the Hospital&quot; the following year and republished in Chongqing&#x27;s &quot;Literary and Art Front&quot;. The articles by Wang Shiwei, Ding Ling, and Xiao Jun were used by the Kuomintang spy agency as anti-communist propaganda at that time... Ding Ling wrote a letter of surrender in Nanjing and betrayed the proletariat and the Communist Party to Chiang Kai-shek. She concealed it and deceived the trust of the party... The articles of Ding Ling, Wang Shiwei and others helped the Japanese imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries...&quot;In June 1958, Ding Ling and her husband Chen Ming were sent to exile in the Great Northern Wilderness in Manchuria. She spent five years in jail during the Cultural Revolution and was sentenced to do manual labor on a farm for twelve years before being &quot;rehabilitated&quot; in 1978.

==Later years==
A few years before her death, Ding was allowed to travel to the United States where she was a guest at the University of Iowa&#x27;s International Writing Program. Ding Ling and her husband Chen Ming visited Canada in 1981 for 10 days, meeting with Canadian writers Margaret Laurence, Adele Wiseman, and Geoff Hancock; and even Canada&#x27;s first female Lieutenant Governor, Pearl McGonigal for the province of Manitoba. Ding Ling died in Beijing on March 4, 1986.

Ding authored more than three hundred works. After her &quot;rehabilitation&quot; many of her previously banned books such as her novel &quot;The Sun Shines Over The Sanggan River&quot; were republished and translated into numerous languages. Some of her short works, spanning a fifty-year period, are collected in &quot;I Myself Am A Woman: Selected Writings Of Ding Ling&quot;.

In her introduction to &quot;Miss Sophie&#x27;s Diary And Other Stories&quot;, Ding Ling explains her indebtedness to the writers of other cultures:I can say that if I had not been influenced by Western literature I would probably not have been able to write fiction, or at any rate not the kind of fiction in this collection. It is obvious that my earliest stories followed the path of Western realism... A little later, as the Chinese revolution developed, my fiction changed with the needs of the age and of the Chinese people... Literature ought to join minds together... turning ignorance into mutual understanding. Time, place and institutions cannot separate it from the friends it wins... And in 1957, a time of spiritual suffering for me, I found consolation in reading much Latin American and African literature.

==In popular culture==
In 2014, Hao Lei played Ding Ling in Ann Hui&#x27;s biopic of Xiao Hong&#x27;s life, &quot;The Golden Era&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The term is the Javanese word for &#x27;shadow&#x27; or &#x27;imagination&#x27;. The word&#x27;s equivalent in Indonesian is . In modern daily Javanese and Indonesian vocabulary, can refer to the puppet itself or the whole puppet theatre performance. The term is used in the Javanese &quot;ngoko&quot; register and its equivalent is .

== History ==
 is the traditional puppet theatre of Indonesia. It is an ancient form of storytelling known for its elaborate puppets and complex musical styles. The earliest evidence of comes from medieval-era texts and archeological sites dating from late 1st millennium CE. There are four theories concerning where originated (indigenous to Java; Java–India; India; and China), but of these, two are more favored: Java and India.

Regardless of its origins, states Brandon, developed and matured into a Javanese phenomenon. There is no true contemporary puppet shadow artwork in either China or India that has the sophistication, depth, and creativity expressed in in Java, Indonesia.

=== Indigenous origin in Java ===
According to academic James R. Brandon, the puppets of are native to Java. He states is closely related to Javanese social culture and religious life, and presents parallel developments from ancient Indonesian culture, such as gamelan, the monetary system, metric forms, batik, astronomy, wet rice field agriculture, and government administration. He asserts that was not derived from any other type of shadow puppetry of mainland Asia, but was an indigenous creation of the Javanese. Indian puppets differ from , and all technical terms are Javanese, not Sanskrit. Similarly, some of the other technical terms used in the found in Java and Bali are based on local languages, even when the play overlaps with Buddhist or Hindu mythologies.

G. A. J. Hazeu also says that came from Java. The puppet structure, puppeteering techniques, and storytelling voices, language, and expressions are all composed according to old traditions. The technical design, the style, and the composition of the Javanese plays grew from the worship of ancestors.

J. Kats argues that the technical terms come from Java and that was born without the help of India. Before the 9th century, it belonged to the Javanese. It was closely related to religious practices, such as incense and night / wandering spirits. Panakawan uses a Javanese name, different from the Indian heroes.

Kruyt argues that originated from shamanism, and makes comparisons with ancient archipelago ceremonial forms which aim to contact the spirit world by presenting religious poetry praising the greatness of the soul.

=== Origin in India ===
Hinduism and Buddhism arrived on the Indonesian islands in the early centuries of the 1st millennium, and along with theology, the peoples of Indonesia and Indian subcontinent exchanged culture, architecture, and traded goods. Puppet arts and dramatic plays have been documented in ancient Indian texts, dated to the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE and the early centuries of the Common Era. Further, the eastern coastal region of India (Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Tamil Nadu), which most interacted with Indonesian islands, has had traditions of intricate, leather-based puppet arts called &quot;tholu bommalata&quot;, &quot;tholpavakoothu&quot;, and &quot;rabana chhaya&quot;, which share many elements with .

Some characters such as the Vidusaka in Sanskrit drama and Semar in are very similar. Indian mythologies and characters from the Hindu epics feature in many major plays, which suggests possible Indian origins, or at least an influence in the pre-Islamic period of Indonesian history. Jivan Pani states that developed from two art forms from Odisha in eastern India: the Ravana Chhaya puppet theatre and the Chhau dance.

=== Records ===
The oldest known record concerning is from the 10th century. In 903 CE, the Dalinan charter was issued by King Balitung of the Sanjaya dynasty of the Ancient Mataram Kingdom. It describes a &quot;wayang&quot; performance: , which means &#x27;Galigi held a puppet show, as service to the gods, telling the story of Bima Kumara&#x27;. It seems certain features of traditional puppet theatre have survived from that time. Galigi may have been an itinerant performer who was requested to perform for a special royal occasion. At that event he performed a story about the hero Bhima from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

Old Javanese inscription called Kuṭi, probably issued in the mid-10th century by Maharaja Sri Lokapala from East Java, mention three sorts of performers: (), (), and / (). is described in an 11th-century Javanese poem as a leather shadow figure.

Mpu Kanwa, the poet of Airlangga&#x27;s court of the Kahuripan kingdom, writes in 1035 CE in his &quot;kakawin&quot; (narrative poem) &quot;Arjunawiwaha&quot;, &quot;&quot;, which means, &quot;He is steadfast and just a screen away from the &#x27;Mover of the World&#x27;.&quot; As is the Javanese word for the screen, the verse eloquently comparing actual life to a performance where the almighty (the mover of the world) as the ultimate (puppet master) is just a thin screen away from mortals. This reference to as shadow plays suggested that performance was already familiar in Airlangga&#x27;s court and tradition had been established in Java, perhaps even earlier. Inscriptions from this period also mention some occupations as and .

 is a unique form of theatre employing light and shadow. The puppets are crafted from buffalo hide and mounted on bamboo sticks. When held up behind a piece of white cloth, with an electric bulb or an oil lamp as the light source, shadows are cast on the screen. The plays are typically based on romantic tales and religious legends, especially adaptations of the classic Indian epics, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Some of the plays are also based on local stories like Panji tales.

==Art form==
=== &quot;Wayang kulit&quot; ===

 are without a doubt the best known of the Indonesian . means &#x27;skin&#x27;, and refers to the leather construction of the puppets that are carefully chiselled with fine tools, supported with carefully shaped buffalo horn handles and control rods, and painted in beautiful hues, including gold. The stories are usually drawn from the Hindu epics the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

There is a family of characters in Javanese called &quot;punokawan&quot;; they are sometimes referred to as &quot;clown-servants&quot; because they normally are associated with the story&#x27;s hero, and provide humorous and philosophical interludes. Semar is actually the god of love, who has consented to live on earth to help humans. He has three sons: Gareng (the eldest), Petruk (the middle), and Bagong (the youngest). These characters did not originate in the Hindu epics, but were added later. They provide something akin to a political cabaret, dealing with gossip and contemporary affairs.

The puppet figures themselves vary from place to place. In Central Java, the city of Surakarta (Solo) and city of Yogyakarta have the best-known traditions, and the most commonly imitated style of puppets. Regional styles of shadow puppets can also be found in Temanggung, West Java, Banyumas, Cirebon, Semarang, and East Java. Bali&#x27;s are more compact and naturalistic figures, and Lombok has figures representing real people. Often modern-world objects as bicycles, automobiles, airplanes and ships will be added for comic effect, but for the most part the traditional puppet designs have changed little in the last 300 years.

Historically, the performance consisted of shadows cast by an oil lamp onto a cotton screen. Today, the source of light used in performance in Java is most often a halogen electric light, while Bali still uses the traditional firelight. Some modern forms of such as (from Bahasa Indonesia, since it uses the national language of Indonesian instead of Javanese) created in the Art Academy at Surakarta (STSI) employ theatrical spotlights, colored lights, contemporary music, and other innovations.

Making a figure that is suitable for a performance involves hand work that takes several weeks, with the artists working together in groups. They start from master models (typically on paper) which are traced out onto skin or parchment, providing the figures with an outline and with indications of any holes that will need to be cut (such as for the mouth or eyes). The figures are then smoothed, usually with a glass bottle, and primed. The structure is inspected and eventually the details are worked through. A further smoothing follows before individual painting, which is undertaken by yet another craftsman.

Finally, the movable parts (upper arms, lower arms with hands and the associated sticks for manipulation) mounted on the body, which has a central staff by which it is held. A crew makes up to ten figures at a time, typically completing that number over the course of a week. However, there is not strong continuing demand for the top skills of craftspersons and the relatively few experts still skilled at the art sometimes find it difficult to earn a satisfactory income.

The painting of less expensive puppets is handled expediently with a spray technique, using templates, and with a different person handling each color. Less expensive puppets, often sold to children during performances, are sometimes made on cardboard instead of leather.

=== &quot;Wayang golek&quot; ===
 are three-dimensional wooden rod puppets that are operated from below by a wooden rod that runs through the body to the head, and by sticks connected to the hands. The construction of the puppets contributes to their versatility, expressiveness and aptitude for imitating human dance. is mainly associated with the Sundanese culture of West Java. In Central Java, the wooden is also known as (), which originated from Kudus, Central Java.

Little is known for certain about the history of , but scholars have speculated that it most likely originated in China and arrived in Java sometime in the 17th century. Some of the oldest traditions of are from the north coast of Java in what is called the Pasisir region. This is home to some of the oldest Muslim kingdoms in Java and it is likely that the grew in popularity through telling the stories of Amir Hamza, the uncle of Muhammad. These stories are still widely performed in Kabumen, Tegal, and Jepara as , and in Cirebon, . Legends about the origins of the attribute their invention to the Muslim saint Wali Sunan Kudus, who used the medium to proselytize Muslim values.

In the 18th century, the tradition moved into the mountainous region of Priangan, West Java, where it eventually was used to tell stories of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; in a tradition now called , which can be found in Bandung, Bogor and Jakarta. The adoption of Javanese Mataram kejawen culture by Sundanese aristocrats was probably the remnant of Mataram influence over the Priangan region during the expansive reign of Sultan Agung. While the main characters from the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; are similar to versions from Central Java, some (servants or jesters) were rendered in Sundanese names and characteristics, such as Cepot or Astrajingga as Bagong, and Dawala or Udel as Petruk. has become the most popular form of today.
===&quot;Wayang klitik&quot;===

 () or () figures occupy a middle ground between the figures of and . They are constructed similarly to figures, but from thin pieces of wood instead of leather, and, like figures, are used as shadow puppets. A further similarity is that they are the same smaller size as figures. However, wood is more subject to breakage than leather. During battle scenes, figures often sustain considerable damage, much to the amusement of the public, but in a country in which before 1970 there were no adequate glues available, breakage generally meant an expensive, newly made figure. On this basis the figures, which are to appear in plays where they have to endure battle scenes, have leather arms. The name of these figures is onomotopaeic, from the sound () that these figures make when worked by the .

 figures come originally from eastern Java, where one still finds workshops turning them out. They are less costly to produce than figures.

The origin of the stories involved in these puppet plays comes from the kingdoms of eastern Java: Jenggala, Kediri and Majapahit. From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelaras, which tells of the adventures of a pair of village youngsters with their fighting cocks. The &quot;Damarwulan&quot; presents the stories of a hero from Majapahit. Damarwulan is a clever chap, who with courage, aptitude, intelligence and the assistance of his young lover Anjasmara makes a surprise attack on the neighboring kingdom and brings down Minakjinggo, an &quot;Adipati&quot; (viceroy) of Blambangan and mighty enemy of Majapahit&#x27;s beautiful queen Sri Ratu Kencanawungu. As a reward, Damarwulan is married to Kencanawungu and becomes king of Majapahit; he also takes Lady Anjasmara as a second wife. This story is full of love affairs and battles and is very popular with the public. The is liable to incorporate the latest local gossip and quarrels and work them into the play as comedy.

=== &quot;Wayang beber&quot; ===

 relies on scroll-painted presentations of the stories being told. has strong similarities to narratives in the form of illustrated ballads that were common at annual fairs in medieval and early modern Europe. They have also been subject to the same fate—they have nearly vanished, although there are still some groups of artists who support in places such as Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java.
Chinese visitors to Java during the 15th century described a storyteller who unrolled scrolls and told stories that made the audience laugh or cry. A few scrolls of images remain from those times, found today in museums. There are two sets, hand-painted on hand-made bark cloth, that are still owned by families who have inherited them from many generations ago, in Pacitan and Wonogiri, both villages in Central Java. Performances, mostly in small open-sided pavilions or auditoriums, take place according to the following pattern:

The gives a sign, the small gamelan orchestra with drummer and a few knobbed gongs and a musician with a (a violin-like instrument held vertically) begins to play, and the unrolls the first scroll of the story. Then, speaking and singing, he narrates the episode in more detail. In this manner, in the course of the evening he unrolls several scrolls one at a time. Each scene in the scrolls represents a story or part of a story. The content of the story typically stems from the Panji romances which are semi-historical legends set in the 12th–13th century East Javanese kingdoms of Jenggala, Daha and Kediri, and also in Bali.

=== &quot;Wayang wong&quot; ===
, also known as (), is a type of Javanese theatrical performance wherein human characters imitate the movements of a puppet show. The show also integrates dance by the human characters into the dramatic performance. It typically shows episodes of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; or the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

=== &quot;Wayang topeng&quot; ===

 () or () theatrical performances take themes from the Panji cycle of stories from the kingdom of Janggala. The players wear masks known as or . The word comes from () which, like &quot;topeng&quot;, means &#x27;mask&#x27;.

 centers on a love story about Princess Candra Kirana of Kediri and Raden Panji Asmarabangun, the legendary crown prince of Janggala. Candra Kirana was the incarnation of Dewi Ratih (the Hindu goddess of love) and Panji was an incarnation of Kamajaya (the Hindu god of love). Kirana&#x27;s story has been given the title &quot;Smaradahana&quot; (&quot;The fire of love&quot;). At the end of the complicated story they finally marry and bring forth a son named Raja Putra. Originally, was performed only as an aristocratic entertainment in the palaces of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. In the course of time, it spread to become a popular and folk form as well.

 () is a cycle of puppet plays that feature the heroic exploits of Wong Agung Jayengrana, who is based on the 12th-century Muslim literary hero Amir Hamzah. stories have been performed in the islands of Java and Lombok in the Indonesian archipelago for several hundred years. They are predominantly performed in Java as , or wooden rod-puppets, but also can be found on Lombok as the shadow puppet tradition, . The tradition most likely originated along the north coast of Java under Chinese Muslim influences and spread East and South and is now most commonly found in the South Coastal region of Kabumen and Yogyakarta.

The word is a Javanese honorific title that is given to people who are recognized at court for their exemplary character even though they are not nobly born. Jayengrana is just such a character who inspires allegiance and devotion through his selfless modesty and his devotion to a monotheistic faith called the &quot;Religion of Abraham.&quot; Jayengrana and his numerous followers do battle with the pagan faiths that threaten their peaceable realm of Koparman. The chief instigator of trouble is Pati Bestak, counselor to King Nuresewan, who goads pagan kings to capture Jayengrana&#x27;s wife Dewi Munninggar. The pagan Kings eventually fail to capture her and either submit to Jayengrana and renounce their pagan faith or die swiftly in combat.

The literary figure of Amir Hamzah is loosely based on the historic person of Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib who was the paternal uncle of Muhammad. Hamzah was a fierce warrior who fought alongside Muhammad and died in the battle of Uhud in 624 CE. the literary tradition traveled from Persia to India and from then on to Southeast Asia where the court poet Yasadipura I (1729-1802) set down the epic in the Javanese language in the &quot;Serat Menak&quot;.

 The wooden is similar in shape to ; it is most prevalent on the northern coast of Central Java, especially the Kudus area.

<doc id="705206" wikidata="Q1506615" url="?curid=705206" title="Leased Territory of Guangzhouwan">
<text>The Leased Territory of officially the , was a territory on the coast of present-day Zhanjiang in China leased to France and administered by French Indochina. The capital of the territory was Fort-Bayard, present-day Zhanjiang.

The Japanese occupied the territory in February 1943. In 1945, following the surrender of Japan, France formally relinquished Guangzhouwan to the Republic of China. The territory did not experience the rapid growth in population that other parts of coastal China experienced, rising from 189,000 in the early 20th century to just 209,000 in 1935. Industries included shipping and coal mining.

== Geography ==
The leased territory was situated on the east side of the Leizhou Peninsula (), near Guangzhou, around a bay then called Kwangchowan, now called the Port of Zhanjiang. The bay forms the estuary of the Maxie River (, ), now known as the Zhanjiang Waterway (). The Maxie is navigable as far as inland even by large warships.

The territory leased to France included the islands lying in the bay, which enclosed an area 29 km long by 10 km wide and a minimum water depth of . The islands were recognised at the time as an admirable natural defence, the main island being Île de Tan-Hai. On the smaller Île Nau-Chau farther to the southeast, a lighthouse was constructed. Another island of significant size is located to the north-northeast.

The limits of the territory inland were fixed in November 1899; on the left bank of the Maxie, France gained from Gaozhou prefecture (Kow Chow Fu) a strip of territory by , and on the right bank a strip by from Leizhou prefecture (Lei Chow Fu). The total land area of the leased territory was . The city of Fort-Bayard (Zhanjiang) was developed as a port.

== History ==
=== French occupation and early development ===
Kwangchouwan was leased to the French for 99 years, or until 1997 (as the British did in Hong Kong&#x27;s New Territories) according to the Treaty of 29 May 1898, ratified by China on 5 January 1900, during the &quot;scramble for concessions&quot;. The colony was described as &quot;commercially unimportant but strategically located&quot;; most of France&#x27;s energies went into their administration of the mainland of French Indochina, and their main concern in China was the protection of Roman Catholic missionaries, rather than the promotion of trade. Kwangchow Wan, while not a constituent part of Indochina, was effectively placed under the authority of the French Resident Superior in Tonkin (itself under the Governor-General of French Indochina, also in Hanoi); the French Resident was represented locally by Administrators. In addition to the territory acquired, France was given the right to connect the bay by railway with the city and harbour situated on the west side of the peninsula; however when they attempted to take possession of the land to build the railway, forces of the provincial government offered armed resistance. As a result, France demanded and obtained exclusive mining rights in the three adjoining prefectures. The return of the leased territory to China was promised after the First World War by the French at the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–1922, but the promise was not fulfilled until 1945, by which time the territory had already ceased to be under French rule.

By 1931, the population of Kwangchow Wan had reached 206,000, giving the colony a population density of 245 persons per km2 (630 per square mile); virtually all Chinese, and only 266 French citizens and four other Europeans were recorded as living there. Industries included shipping and coal mining. The port was also popular with smugglers; prior to the 1928 cancellation of the American ban on the export of commercial airplanes, Kwangchow Wan was also used as a stop for Cantonese smugglers transporting military aircraft purchased in Manila to China, and US records mention at least one drug smuggler who picked up opium and Chinese emigrants to be smuggled into the United States from there.

=== World War II ===

As an adjunct of French Indochina, Kwangchow Wan generally endured the same fate as the rest of the Indochina colony during World War II. Even before the signing of the 30 August 1940 accord with Japan in which France recognised the “privileged status of Japanese interests in the Far East” and which constituted the first step of the Japanese military occupation of Indochina, a small detachment of Japanese marines had landed at Fort-Bayard without opposition in early July and set up a control and observation post in the harbour. However, as in the rest of French Indochina, the civilian administration of the territory was to remain in the hands of officials of Vichy France following the Fall of France; in November 1941, Governor-General Jean Decoux, newly appointed by Marshal Philippe Pétain, made an official visit to Kwangchow Wan.

In mid-February 1943, the Japanese, after having informed the Vichy government that they needed to strengthen the defence of Kwangchow Wan, unilaterally landed more troops and occupied the airport and all other strategic locations in the Territory. From then on, Kwangchow Wan was &quot;de facto&quot; under full military Japanese occupation and the French civilian administration was gradually reduced to a mere façade. The Administrator resigned in disgust and Adrien Roques, a local pro-Vichy militant, was appointed to replace him. In May of the same year, Roques signed a convention with the local Japanese military authorities in which the French authorities promised to cooperate fully with the Japanese. On 10 March 1945, the Japanese, following up on their sudden attack on French garrisons throughout Indochina the night before, disarmed and imprisoned the small French colonial garrison in Fort-Bayard. Just prior to the Japanese surrender, Chinese forces were prepared to launch a large-scale assault on Kwangchow Wan; however, due to the end of the war, the assault never materialised. While the Japanese were still occupying Kwangchow Wan following the surrender, a French diplomat from the Provisional Government of the French Republic and Kuo Chang Wu, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, signed the &quot;Convention between the Provisional Government of the French Republic and the National Government of China for the retrocession of the Leased Territory of Kouang-Tchéou-Wan&quot;. Almost immediately after the last Japanese occupation troops had left the territory in late September, representatives of the French and the Chinese governments went to Fort-Bayard to proceed to the transfer of authority; the French flag was lowered for the last time on 20 November 1945.

During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Kwangchow Wan was often used as a stopover on an escape route for civilians fleeing Hainan and Hong Kong and trying to make their way to Thailand, North America and Free China; Patrick Yu, a prominent trial lawyer, recalled in his memoirs how a Japanese military officer helped him escape in this way. However, the escape route was closed when the Japanese occupied the area in February 1943.

=== Return ===
The territory was formally returned to the Republic of China on 18 August 1945 after a meeting between the French and Chinese.

== French language ==
A French-language school, École Franco-Chinoise de Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, as well as a branch of the Banque de l&#x27;Indochine, were set up in Fort-Bayard. In addition, a Roman Catholic church (St. Victor) constructed during the French occupation is still preserved today.

<text>The Oltcit Club is a supermini produced between 1981 and 1991 and developed in co-operation by Citroën of France and Oltcit, a joint venture company with the Romanian government.

They were powered by the air-cooled engines from the Citroën GS/GSA; the air-cooled flat-twin engine from the Citroën Visa used in the Romanian-market Oltcit Special was not installed in the export-only Citroën Axel.

==Development history==

From 1965 Robert Opron worked on the Citroën G-mini prototype and project EN101, a projected replacement for the 2CV using that car&#x27;s flat twin engine. It was supposed to be launched in 1970. The advanced space-efficient designs, with very compact exterior dimensions and an aerodynamic drag co-efficient Cd of 0.32, were axed because of adverse feedback from potential clients. The more conservative final design has a Cd of 0.36 (for the Axel 12 TRS, 0.37 for the Axel 11).
The early seventies Citroën Prototype Y, intended to replace the 2CV-based Citroën Ami which dated back to 1960, was originally developed in co-operation with Fiat. It built on the lessons from the Citroën G-mini and EN101 projects. It used the then new and advanced Fiat 127 platform, featuring a transversely mounted engine driving the front wheels, with an end-on gearbox layout that Fiat had pioneered in the 1960s. When cooperation with Fiat ended, a new Citroën-designed platform was planned. After the takeover of Citroën by Peugeot in the wake of the 1974 oil crisis, the renamed &quot;Projet VD (Voiture Diminuée)&quot; became the Citroën Visa, incorporating the floor pan of the Peugeot 104 and using the advanced 104 engine with the (under-engine) transmission and chassis. It was the first new model under the platform-sharing policy of PSA Peugeot Citroën that continues today. The earlier Citroën LN was no more than a facelift of the Peugeot 104Z &quot;Shortcut&quot; with a re-engine and transmission from the Citroën Dyane.

Eventually, in 1981, the original Citroën platform design from &quot;Project Y&quot; emerged as an Oltcit in Romania, using a Citroën Visa flat-twin engine and Citroën GS-based gearbox, and Citroën GS flat-four engine and gearbox. Beginning in July 1984, it was also sold in Western Europe as the Citroën Axel. Citroën was hoping to recoup money that Citroën had invested in Romania that the communist government couldn&#x27;t repay. The Axel had been scheduled for an earlier introduction, but Oltcit had been unable to provide either the quality or the quantity expected by their French partners. This project was problematic for Citroën due to productivity and build quality issues and 60,184 cars were made, even though the base models were priced below the 2CV in Western Europe. The Axel was never sold in the UK.

When launched in France, Citroën acknowledged that the Axel was a competitor of their Visa. However, that the Axel only had three doors and was of a simpler, more robust design was considered enough to offset any possible loss of (already shrinking) Visa sales. The four-cylinder Axel 11 was 10 percent cheaper than a two-cylinder Visa in the French market. It also had a particularly low rear loading height, which, with its sturdy, basic construction, contributed to being particularly well received by farmers and denizens of smaller towns.

In addition to the regular Axel, there was also a light commercial version with no rear seats available, called the &quot;Axel Entreprise.&quot;

==Production==

The Oltcit Club carried on with the Prototype Y-derived design and was sold between 1981 and 1995. It was also sold in Western Europe, often badged as the Citroën Axel.

In 1991, as a result of the withdrawal of Citroën from the joint venture, the name of the manufacturing company was changed to Automobile Craiova and production continued under the &quot;Oltena&quot; brand.

After 1994, it was sold under the &quot;Rodae&quot; brand, when the company decided to go into partnership with Korean company Daewoo Heavy Industries (later Daewoo Motors).

==Oltcit Club 12 CS==

The Oltcit Club 12 CS is a small pick-up based on the Oltcit Club. It was launched in 1993 with a 1299 cc engine and a 5-speed gearbox with ratios that favor power. This model also has thicker rear torsion bars to withstand a greater load.

<text>Austerity in Israel (, ) was the policy of austerity imposed in the State of Israel from 1949 to 1959. It included rationing and other emergency measures to weather the economic crisis in the early days of statehood.

==History==
After its establishment in 1948, the newly formed State of Israel was on the verge of bankruptcy, lacking in both food, resources, and foreign currency. This was largely due to the inherited economic framework of the British Mandatory government that was based on a war time economy.

After the Second World War and the 1948 Palestine War, Israel was war-torn and needed to accommodate an increasing number of Jewish immigrants. Consequently, the Israeli government instigated measures to control and oversee distribution of necessary resources to ensure equal and ample rations for all Israeli citizens.

In addition to the problems with the provision of food, national austerity was also required because the state was lacking in foreign currency reserves. Export revenues covered less than a third of the cost of imports, and less than half of the consequent deficit was covered by the Jewish loan system known as &quot;Magbiyot&quot; (Hebrew: מגביות, &#x27;Collections&#x27;). Most financing was obtained from foreign banks and gas companies, which, as 1951 drew to an end, refused to expand the available credit. In order to supervise the austerity, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion ordered the establishment of the Ministry of Rationing and Supply (Hebrew: משרד הקיצוב והאספקה, &quot;Misrad HaKitzuv VeHaAspaka&quot;), headed by Dov Yosef.

At first, rationing was set for staple foods alone (cooking oil, sugar and margarine, for instance), but it was later expanded to furniture and footwear. Each month, each citizen would get food coupons worth IL6, and each family was allotted a given amount of foodstuffs. The diet chosen, fashioned after that used in the United Kingdom during World War II, allowed a meager 1,600 calories a day for Israeli citizens, with additional calories for children, the elderly, and pregnant women.

The enforcement of austerity required the establishment of a bureaucracy of quite some proportions, but it proved ineffective in preventing the emergence of a black market in which rationed products, often smuggled from the countryside, were sold at higher prices. In response, the government established in September 1950 the &quot;Office for Fighting the Black Market&quot; (Hebrew: מטה למלחמה בשוק השחור, &quot;Mateh LeMilhama BaShuk HaShahor&quot;), whose goal was fighting the black market. However, despite the increased supervision, and the specially summoned courts, all such attempts at suppression proved ineffective.[&quot;&quot;]

==End of austerity==
In 1952 the Reparations Agreement between Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany was signed, compensating Israel for confiscation of Jewish property during the Holocaust. The resulting influx of foreign capital was a huge boost to the state&#x27;s struggling economy, and led to the cancellation of most restrictions in 1953. In 1956, the list of rationed goods was narrowed to just fifteen goods, and it shrank to eleven in 1958. Shortly afterwards, it was abolished for all goods except jam, sugar and coffee. In 1959, rationing was abolished altogether.

Economically, austerity proved a failure, mostly due to the enormous government budget deficit, covered by bank loans, creating an increase in the amount of money use. Throughout austerity unemployment remained high, and inflation grew as of 1951. 

The austerity measures implemented by Israel were not uncommon nor unlike other post-war countries such as the United States and the British Empire, who had also severe austerity measures in place. Despite the perceived &quot;unpleasantness&quot; of rationing, they had advantages and disadvantages, and Israel maintained a growing population of immigrants from Europe and Arab Nations.
