<text>Charles Tolliver (born 1942) is an American jazz trumpeter, composer, and co-founder of Strata East Records.

==Biography==
Tolliver was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1942 and moved with his family to New York City when he was 10. During his childhood, his grandmother gave him his first horn, a cornet he had coveted. Tolliver attended Howard University in the early 1960s as a pharmacy major, when he decided to pursue music as a career and return home to New York City. He came to prominence in 1964, playing and recording on Jackie McLean&#x27;s Blue Note albums. In 1971, Tolliver and Stanley Cowell founded Strata-East Records, and Tolliver released many albums and collaborations on Strata-East. Following a long hiatus, he reemerged in the late 2000s, releasing two albums arranged for big band, &quot;With Love&quot; and &quot;Emperor March&quot;. &quot;With Love&quot; was nominated in 2007 for a Grammy award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble.

He would later describe his experience: &quot;There was so much going on with the music. Like with bebop, we had a long period of just salivating on. There were all these different idioms within a genre, the avant-garde and free music, bebop still, and of course the music of John Coltrane and Miles. It was just a hell of a period. And then there was also the political scene going on...&quot;

<doc id="697631" wikidata="Q446428" url="?curid=697631" title="Here's Boomer">
<text>Here&#x27;s Boomer is an American adventure/drama television series produced by Paramount Television that premiered on the NBC network on March 14, 1980. A television film called &quot;A Christmas for Boomer&quot; aired on December 6, 1979, and served as the pilot. A spin-off of the live-action series &quot;The Red Hand Gang&quot;, the show follows the adventures of the titular stray dog, &quot;Boomer&quot; and ran for two seasons, ending its run on August 14, 1982, with the final original episode, &quot;Flatfoots,&quot; airing on July 3 of that year.

==Synopsis==
The series followed the adventures of Boomer, a stray dog that traveled around helping people in trouble. The part of Boomer in all of the shows was played by a four-year-old mongrel named Johnny, who was trained by Ray Berwick. One early title considered for the series was &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;, after the dog who played the part, but was rejected owing to the use of that catch-phrase on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

Johnny reportedly earned $3,500 a week while appearing on the series, and had a stunt dog who stood in for him on some of his more difficult tricks.

When the series was set to return in the fall of 1980, viewers were to hear Boomer&#x27;s thoughts the same way viewers had heard Jackie Cooper&#x27;s dog&#x27;s thoughts on &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot; in the 1950s. However, Boomer&#x27;s thoughts were only heard in one episode aired as a special on December 7, 1980. When the series returned with new episodes in 1981 the gimmick was dropped and viewers could no longer hear Boomer.

The premise of &quot;Here&#x27;s Boomer&quot; was similar to that of the &quot;Benji&quot; films and television specials of the 1970s and 1980s. In real life, both Johnny and Higgins, the dog who first played Benji, were abandoned or lost mixed-breed dogs who were adopted from animal shelters by animal trainers in California. On screen, both played the parts of stray dogs who were smart, friendly, and loving of their human and animal friends.

The show bore a similarity to the Canadian TV series &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, which was running at the same time on CTV Television Network in Canada and in syndication in the U.S. Both series are about a vagabond dog who helps people in trouble only to go on his way at the end of the episode, and both series even used similar title sequences involving split screens. The only significant difference between the shows was the breed of the dog in each show (London, the star of &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;, was a German Shepherd).

<text>Llanelly () is a village, community, and parish in the county of Monmouthshire, south-east Wales, within the historic county boundaries of Brecknockshire. It roughly covers the area of the Clydach Gorge. The population of the community and ward at the 2011 census was 3,899.

==Location==
The community encompasses the area surrounding the Clydach Gorge, west of Abergavenny, east of Brynmawr and south of Crickhowell.

==Settlements==
Llanelly Hill, Blackrock, Clydach, Maesygwartha and Gilwern are the main settlements in the community. Llanelly Hill occupies the north-west hilltop of the Clydach Gorge. It developed as a result of coal mining and limestone quarrying for the nearby ironworks including those at Clydach and Ebbw Vale.

Blackrock and Clydach North (also referred to as Cheltenham) were both built up along the turnpike road that ran on the north side of the river between Govilon and Merthyr Tydfil. Clydach South developed on the south side of the river above the ironworks. It climbs the north-west slopes towards Llanelly Hill.

Gilwern is located at the mouth of the River Clydach, where it meets the River Usk. 
Maesygwartha lies between Clydach and Gilwern along one of the many tramroads in the gorge.

==History==
The Church of St Elli dates from the 14th century or earlier. The community is part of the county of Monmouthshire. Historically within Brecknockshire, from the local government reorganisation of 1974 until that of 1996, it lay in the district of Blaenau Gwent, but the electors overwhelmingly voted to be transferred out. The highest part of the parish, in the southwest had previously been transferred into the new urban district of Brynmawr in the 1890s. The Brecon Beacons National Park encompasses the parish and the surrounding area.

==Governance==
The electoral ward of Llanelly Hill is coterminous with the Llanelly community and elects one county councillor to Monmouthshire County Council.

==Notable persons==
*Sir Henry Bartle Frere (1815–1884), Governor-General of South Africa at the outbreak of the Anglo-Zulu War 
*Thomas Phillips (1801–1867), Mayor of Newport during the Newport Rising

<text>A dabbawala (also spelled dabbawalla or dabbawallah, called tiffin wallah in older sources) is a worker who delivers hot lunches from homes and restaurants to people at work in India, especially in Mumbai. The dabbawalas constitute a lunchbox delivery and return system for workers in Mumbai. The lunchboxes are picked up in the late morning, delivered predominantly using bicycles and railway trains, and returned empty in the afternoon.

== Origins ==
In the late 1800s, an increasing number of migrants were moving to Bombay from different parts of the country, and fast food and canteens were not prevalent. All these people left early in the morning for offices, and often had to go hungry for lunch. They belonged to different communities, and therefore had different types of tastes, which could only be satisfied by their own home-cooked meals. So, in 1890, Mahadeo Havaji Bachche started a lunch delivery service in Bombay with about a hundred men. This proved to be successful, and the service grew from there. In 1930, he informally attempted to unionize the dabbawalas. Later, a charitable trust was registered in 1956 under the name of Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Trust. The commercial arm of this trust was registered in 1968 as Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association.

== Etymology ==
When literally translated, the word &quot;dabbawala&quot; means &quot;one who carries a box&quot;. &quot;Dabba&quot; means a box (usually a cylindrical tin or aluminium container) from , while &quot;wala&quot; is an agentive suffix, denoting a doer or holder of the preceding word. An English translation would be &quot;tiffin box delivery man&quot;.

==Colour-coding system==
Lunch boxes are marked in several ways:
# Abbreviations for collection points
# Colour code for starting station
# Number for destination station
# Markings for handling dabbawala at destination, building and floor

A colour-coding system identifies the destination and recipient. Each dabbawala is required to contribute a minimum capital in kind, in the form of two bicycles, a wooden crate for the tiffins, white cotton kurta-pyjamas, and the white Gandhi cap (topi). Each month there is a division of the earnings of each unit. Fines are imposed for alcohol, tobacco, being out of uniform, and absenteeism.

A collecting dabbawala, usually on bicycle, collects dabbas either from a worker&#x27;s home or from the dabba makers. As many of the carriers are of limited literacy (the average literacy of Dabbawallahs is that of 8th grade), the dabbas (boxes) have some sort of distinguishing mark on them, such as a colour or group of symbols.

The dabbawala then takes them to a sorting place, where he and other collecting dabbawalas sort the lunch boxes into groups. The grouped boxes are put in the coaches of trains, with markings to identify the destination of the box (usually there is a designated car for the boxes). The markings include the railway station to unload the boxes and the destination building delivery address. Some modern infrastructure improvements such as the Navi Mumbai Metro are not used in the supply chain, as cabins do not have the capacity for hundreds of tiffins.

At each station, boxes are handed over to a local dabbawala, who delivers them. The empty boxes are collected after lunch or the next day and sent back to the respective houses. The dabbawalas also allow for delivery requests through SMS.

==Ethnicity==

Most dabbawalas are related to each other, belong to the Varkari sect of Maharashtra, and come from the same small village near Pune. Tiffin distribution is suspended for five days each March as the dabbawalas go home for the annual village festival.

Dabbawalas have traditionally been male, but in recent years a few women have joined the profession. A dabbawala can be either a foreman, &quot;mukadam&quot;, or a simple delivery man, &quot;gaddi&quot;. Typically, they begin between the ages of 15 and 20. While they take pride in their freedom and the fact that they work in a network of their relatives, the relatively low compensation provided for their physical exertion makes them discourage their own children from joining the profession.

In a typical day, a dabbawala picks up tiffins every morning and then sorts them once before they are loaded onto the morning train (at approximately 10a.m.). The tiffins are sorted another time in the luggage compartment of the train. At the destination station, the tiffins are loaded into carts and deposited in stacks at the entrances of the various workplaces. Following lunch, the same procedure is carried out in the reverse order with the empty tiffins.

== Association ==
The earliest meetings of the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association were held in the open air. They took up premises in 1943 and settled the headquarters at Dadar in 1962. Located on the first floor of a building, the premises consist of a large, simply furnished room. A large mirrored painting of Saint Dnyaneshwar with Vithoba adorns one corner. Other portraits adorning the room include those of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and the founder of the association, Mahadeo Havaji Bachche.

The association was reportedly started after a dabbawalla was ill-treated by a customer, resulting in the dabbawallas deciding to form a &quot;united front&quot; while dealing with injustices or difficulties, such as funerals. The association also helps with managing legal issues, including conflicts between &quot;mukadams&quot; and &quot;gaddis&quot;. All conflicts are resolved in the presence of 20 &quot;mukadams&quot;, which are selected every six years.

The charitable Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Trust consists of nine members who are elected every five years. Its main role is to collect funds for dharamshalas.

==Economic analysis==
Each &quot;dabbawala&quot;, regardless of role, is paid around 8,000 rupees per month (about US$131 in 2014). Between 175,000 and 200,000 lunch boxes are moved each day by 4,500 to 5,000 dabbawalas. Tiffin-wallahs are self-employed. The union initiation fee is 30,000 rupees, which guarantees a 5,000-rupee monthly income and a job for life. The 150 rupee a month fee provides for delivery six days a week. (2002)

It is frequently claimed that &quot;dabbawalas&quot; make less than one mistake in every six million deliveries; however, this is only an estimation from Ragunath Medge, the president of the Mumbai Tiffinmen&#x27;s Association in 1998, and is not from a rigorous study. Medge told Subrata Chakravarty, the lead author of the &quot;Fast Food&quot; article by &quot;Forbes&quot; where this claim first appeared, that &quot;dabbawalas&quot; make a mistake &quot;almost never, maybe once every two months&quot; and this statement was extrapolated by Subrata Chakravarty to be a rate of &quot;one mistake in 8 million deliveries.&quot; Chakravarty recalled the affair in an interview and said:

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2007 that the 125-year-old dabbawala industry continues to grow at a rate of 5–10% per year.

==Studies ==
Various studies have focused on dabbawalas: 
* In 2001, Pawan G. Agrawal carried out his PhD research in &quot;A Study &amp; Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Management of Dabbawala in Mumbai&quot;. He presented his results on the efficiency of Dabbawallas in various fora.
* In 2005, the Indian Institute of Management (Ahmedabad) featured a case study on the Mumbai Dabbawallas from a management perspective of logistics.
* In 2010, Harvard Business School added the case study &quot;The Dabbawala System: On-Time Delivery, Every Time&quot; to their compendium for its high level of service with a low-cost and simple operating system.
* In 2014, Uma S. Krishnan completed her PhD research in &quot;A Cross-Cultural Study of the Literacy Practices of The Dabbawalas: Towards a New Understanding of Non-mainstream Literacy and its Impact on Successful Business Practices.&quot;

== Notable events ==

* Dabbawallas were invited to the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005.
*As of 2010, the dabbawallas were chosen by Bharti Airtel to distribute advertising pamphlets, with a commission for every dabbawalla.
*On 21 March 2011, Prakash Baly Bachche carried three dabbawalla tiffin crates on his head at one time, which was entered as a Guinness World Record.
* In 2011, dabbawalas went on strike for the first time in 120 years to promote and attend a rally at Azad Maidan to support Anna Hazare as part of the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement.
*Over the years, the dabbawallas have been visited by many prominent personalities like Charles, Prince of Wales, Richard Branson and then US Commerce Secretary, Gary Locke.

==In popular culture==
The 2013 Bollywood film &quot;The Lunchbox&quot; is based on the dabbawala service.

The &quot;Top Gear: India Special&quot;, a special episode of the British TV series &quot;Top Gear&quot;, had the presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May attempting to outdo the dabbawalas in efficiency and accuracy, by delivering the lunches with their cars, rather than by train and bicycle.

<doc id="697648" wikidata="Q7431614" url="?curid=697648" title="Schizophrenic (JC Chasez album)">
<text>Schizophrenic is the debut studio album by American recording artist JC Chasez. It was released on February 24, 2004, by Jive Records. The album spanned various musical genres, including New Wave, electronica, rock, disco, soul and reggae. Chasez served as a primary producer, co-writing fifteen of the album&#x27;s tracks. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Some Girls (Dance with Women)&quot; and &quot;All Day Long I Dream About Sex&quot;.

Though the album had minimal promotion at its time of release and was not met with large commercial success, it has since been retroactively praised by critics for its musical breadth, vocals, production, and electropop sound.

==Background==
After his group NSYNC went on hiatus following the Celebrity Tour in 2002, Chasez teamed up with producer Dallas Austin to record the song &quot;Blowin&#x27; Me Up (With Her Love)&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Drumline&quot;. Following the song&#x27;s success as a single, Chasez began working on a record that he intended to be different from NSYNC&#x27;s music. Chasez had not intended on embarking on a solo career until Austin convinced him to make an album. Of Austin&#x27;s encouragement, Chasez said, &quot;He&#x27;s like, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got too much to say. You know, there&#x27;s no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re writing songs anyway.’&quot; 

Chasez said the album title is derived &quot;from [its] different styles and attitudes that are on this album. It&#x27;s gritty, it&#x27;s noisy, and it is definitely not like anything I&#x27;ve done before.&quot; Austin described the album as a throwback &quot;to George Michael and Prince and that &#x27;80s era, where even though you had up-tempos, they still had songs to them, they had a lot of attitude.&#x27;&quot; Aside from Chasez and Austin, the album features productions from Robb Boldt and Riprock &#x27;n&#x27; Alex G, the latter having worked with Chasez on &quot;No Strings Attached&quot; and &quot;Celebrity&quot;. Basement Jaxx wrote and produced the song &quot;Shake It&quot; after Chasez lent his vocals to the duo&#x27;s single &quot;Plug It In.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
The release of &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; was delayed repeatedly, with a planned release date in the summer of 2003 bumped to that fall, and again bumped to January in the following year. When the album was released on February 24, 2004, promotion was further affected by the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy which had occurred earlier that month. Chasez was scheduled to perform &quot;Some Girls (Dance with Women)&quot; at the Pro Bowl in Hawaii a week after the Super Bowl, but due to the NFL&#x27;s crackdown on what they perceived to be indecent content in the song, organizers demanded Chasez sing &quot;Blowin&#x27; Me Up (With Her Love)&quot; instead. Chasez was again asked to make changes to the song, particularly the line: &quot;She was leaning on me/ Getting horny/ Maybe we&#x27;ll get naughty&quot;. Ultimately, Chasez&#x27;s Pro Bowl appearance was nixed. In addition, radio stations declined to play the single &quot;All Day Long I Dream About Sex&quot; for fear of FCC fines, preventing the song and music video from gaining exposure.

To promote &quot;Schizophrenic&quot;, Chasez began a mini club tour in December 2003, earning positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Chronicle.&quot; Marketing for the album fared better in the United Kingdom, where Chasez was an opening act on several dates for Britney Spears&#x27; Onyx Hotel tour. Prior to and after his opening dates for Spears, Chasez toured venues in the U.S accompanied by a five-piece band. In a review of his show at New York&#x27;s Roseland Ballroom, Chasez was described as &quot;a fine singer who performed every song during the brief but explosive 75-minute set. Still, as good as his voice was (especially on the ballad &#x27;Dear Goodbye&#x27;), his dancing stole the show.&quot;

Devon Powers of &quot;PopMatters&quot; noted that &quot;Chasez&#x27;s years of performing multiple nights to crowds ten times as large were put to good use. Complete with dancers, costume changes, lights, and props, Chasez crossed the line from sheer musician to pure entertainer...If the music business is a circus, Chasez set out to produce The Greatest Show on Earth.&quot; Powers also praised his vocal talents: &quot;His voice is, without question, a miracle: elastic and tough, it can move from curdling to coddling in an instant, pushing the limits of what one would think is humanely possible.&quot;

Jon Pareles (&quot;The New York Times&quot;) commented &quot;Mr. Chasez is most retro in his rock; like a promising apprentice, he directly mimicked Robert Plant and Prince (singing Prince&#x27;s &#x27;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&#x27;), and whipped up a fervor to rival early Sting in his Police imitation, &#x27;Everything You Want.&#x27;&quot; Patrick Berkery (&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;) wrote, &quot;Chasez was a bumping and grinding, locking and popping dancing machine as he sang carnally minded jams from his debut solo outing...in a voice that alternated between achy tenor and fluttery falsetto.&quot;

In addition to touring, Chasez appeared and performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;, and &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;. He performed the ballad &quot;Build My World&quot; at the Miss Teen USA pageant.

The title and cover art for &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; attracted criticism from mental health groups for misappropriating schizophrenia, the brain disorder. Chasez issued an apology, clarifying that his album title and cover art was not in reference to the clinical definition of the term, but to the album&#x27;s varied musical styles.

==Critical reception==

Upon release, &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; garnered mixed to positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 57 based on 16 reviews. Critics lauded the album for its adventurous range of musical styles. James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; admired JC for going through different genres throughout the album, concluding with &quot;No doubt about it, &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; is a lot. It&#x27;s also cool.&quot; P.E. Nelson called the album &quot;an immensely listenable collection of well-crafted pop tunes&quot; that shows Chasez wears &quot;his influences on his sleeve,&quot; and Aidin Vaziri of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; &quot;[proves] that dance music is fun and technological and dirty.&quot; Peter Robinson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote although the album wasn’t a commercial success, “Chasez has still come up trumps, creatively and artistically at least, with a dark and unusually adventurous collection of 1980s electro and Prince-type funk”.

In another positive review of the album, Joan Anderman of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; likened the first single &quot;Some Girls (Dance with Women)&quot; to &quot;a jungly clutch of rhythms iced with an itchy-sweet melody, part conga line, part pop tune. It&#x27;s sexy and silly and funky in a George Michael sort of way.&quot; Critic William Jefferson praised the &quot;fast and furious wordplay&quot; of &quot;Some Girls&quot; as well as its &quot;tightly woven harmonies as alluring as silk and satin.&quot; Doug Rule of Metro Weekly wrote, &quot;Chasez exudes confidence in creating pop music -- and especially playful pop music of a hot-blooded, dance orientation,&quot; and said the single &quot;All Day Long I Dream About Sex&quot; has a &quot;fascinating acoustic meets electronica sound and an extended instrumental bridge that glistens with updated &#x27;80s synth-pop.&quot;

Critics also had praise for the album&#x27;s ballads, particularly &quot;Dear Goodbye and Build My World&quot;, Chasez&#x27;s vocals, and the album&#x27;s production. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the producers for taking risks with different genres, concluding &quot;Chasez may not be able to eclipse Timberlake&#x27;s star, but in his favor, he does have an album that on a strictly musical level tries harder and achieves more than &quot;Justified&quot; &quot;. Tom Moon of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; noted how Chasez &quot;avoided the just-add-water hooks of teen pop in favor of more elaborate chord sequences and compositional schemes.&quot;

Other critics were divided about the album&#x27;s refusal to stick to one uniform sound, as well as the album&#x27;s length. Neil Drumming of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noticed the &#x27;80s influenced production by Riprock and Alex G. but found Chasez&#x27;s attempt at a new sound to be &quot;a tad misguided.&quot; Much attention was given to the album&#x27;s more overtly sexual lyrics, which some critics saw as distracting and as an excessive attempt by Chasez to shed his boy band image. Others saw these lyrics as tongue-in-cheek humor, noting how Chasez knowingly &quot;[pokes] fun at himself in the comical &#x27;One Night Stand.’&quot;

In more recent reviews, critics have noted that &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; was ahead of its time in its &quot;dance-pop and electronic-driven style.&quot; A lack of support from Jive Records, as well as bad timing, have been seen as factors in preventing &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; from gaining wider appreciation during its release. In a piece for Shondaland.com discussing Chasez&#x27;s work on &quot;Schizophrenic&quot;, writer Britt Julious wrote:&quot;Schizophrenic&quot; showed the sort of promise rarely seen from post-pop stardom musicians. From the smart wordplay of &quot;Some Girls (Dance With Women)&quot; to the progressive, percussion-heavy production of &quot;Blowing Me Up (With Her Love),&quot; &quot;Schizophrenic&quot; was an original album from an artist’s artist. Chasez’s appreciation for a variety of different genres of music was on full display in the album’s production. In the first three tracks alone, Chasez bounces between sensual R&amp;B, comforting pop-rock, and progressive rock. It didn’t sound like any other pop released in its era.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Schizophrenic&quot; debuted at number 17 on the US Billboard 200 selling 52,000 copies in its first week. In its second week the album dropped 65 positions to number 82 with sales of 15,000. As of 2013, the album has sold 121,000 copies in total.

<text>Treasure Island Hotel and Casino (also known as Treasure Island Las Vegas and &quot;TI&quot;) is a pirate-themed hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, U.S. It includes 2,885 rooms and a casino. The resort is owned and operated by businessman Phil Ruffin.

Treasure Island was developed by casino owner Steve Wynn through his company, Mirage Resorts. Project designers included Joel Bergman and Jon Jerde. Wynn announced Treasure Island in October 1991, and construction began four months later. The resort opened on October 26, 1993. Treasure Island was among several family-oriented resorts to open in Las Vegas during the 1990s, taking advantage of the growing tourist demographic. Treasure Island&#x27;s facade was built with a lagoon containing two pirate ships. Free pirate battles were performed daily for spectators over the next two decades. The resort has also hosted &quot;Mystère&quot; since 1993, making it the longest-running show by Cirque du Soleil.

In 2000, MGM Grand Inc. acquired Mirage Resorts and was renamed MGM Mirage. Treasure Island&#x27;s pirate theme was scaled back during a 2003 project aimed at attracting a more mature audience, in contrast to the family trend of the 1990s. MGM&#x27;s revamp included new signage abbreviating the resort&#x27;s name as &quot;TI&quot;, while the original pirate show, &quot;Battle of Buccaneer Bay&quot;, was replaced by &quot;Sirens of TI&quot;.

MGM struggled financially during the Great Recession. In 2009, it sold Treasure Island to Ruffin for $755 million. Ruffin targeted a middle-class clientele, making various changes to appeal to the demographic. He added two signature restaurants: Gilley&#x27;s Saloon in 2010, and Señor Frog&#x27;s in 2012. The pirate shows ended the following year, although the ships remain on display.

== History ==
In 1986, casino owner Steve Wynn purchased property on the Las Vegas Strip extending north to Spring Mountain Road. He opened a resort, The Mirage, on the southern portion of the land in 1989. Wynn had always wanted to build a second casino on the remaining acreage, which was being used as a parking lot for the Mirage.

Wynn&#x27;s company, Mirage Resorts, announced the Treasure Island project on October 30, 1991. Like other new resorts in Las Vegas, Treasure Island was planned as a family-oriented property, taking advantage of the growing tourist demographic. It would also cater to a middle-class clientele, unlike the Mirage. Groundbreaking took place on March 2, 1992, earlier than anticipated. Construction was originally expected to cost $300 million, but the final cost rose to $430 million.

Employees and their families stayed at Treasure Island a couple days before the opening to put the resort through a trial run. Treasure Island opened to the public at 10:00 p.m. on October 26, 1993, following a private opening for VIPs, including Nevada governor Bob Miller. The resort&#x27;s facade featured a free pirate show taking place in a man-made lagoon. Wynn&#x27;s other Strip resort, the shuttered Dunes, was imploded the following night in a grand ceremony which incorporated the pirate show. One of the ships fired its cannon as the implosion began, simulating the resort&#x27;s destruction by cannonballs.
In 1996, Treasure Island hosted a naturalization ceremony for 93 workers. It was the first Las Vegas resort to hold such an event.

A man robbed the casino twice in 2000, stealing more than $30,000. He was arrested after a failed third attempt, during which he shot a security guard. He was sentenced to 130 years in prison.

The Prairie Island Indian Community, owners of a Treasure Island casino resort in Minnesota, filed a $250 million damages lawsuit against Mirage Resorts in May 2000. The suit alleged that Wynn violated trademark law by using the &quot;Treasure Island&quot; name for his own casino resort. The suit also requested that Wynn be barred from using the name, which Wynn said he registered in 1993.

Wynn departed Mirage Resorts in 2000, when it was acquired by MGM Grand Inc., later renamed MGM Mirage.

Treasure Island&#x27;s family amenities included the pirate show and an arcade. However, the pirate theme and family appeal would be gradually scaled back in subsequent years. In April 2003, Treasure Island announced a major revamp to transform the resort into a more sophisticated property aimed primarily at adults, although children would still be welcomed. Describing the resort&#x27;s transformation, Treasure Island president Scott Sibella said, &quot;We&#x27;ve seen a return of Las Vegas to its roots as an adult destination. As the city has evolved, so too has Treasure Island.&quot; He said, &quot;We&#x27;ve evolved from a yo-ho-ho feel to a more sophisticated feel. We want to change the exterior to introduce the outside to what we&#x27;ve already done inside.&quot; As part of the revamp, Treasure Island began using the abbreviated name &quot;TI&quot;. Sibella described the new name as trendy and sexy, and said it was a name that residents and guests already used. He compared the abbreviated name to the former Desert Inn resort, also known as &quot;D.I.&quot; MGM Mirage began a marketing campaign for TI in June 2003, including advertisements in various publications.

MGM struggled financially during the Great Recession, and businessman Phil Ruffin made an offer to buy Treasure Island. MGM accepted and announced the deal at the end of 2008. The purchase was finalized on March 20, 2009, at a cost of $755 million. At the time, Treasure Island was the only hotel-casino on the Strip to be owned by a single individual, as others are corporate-owned. Because of the sale, Treasure Island was removed from MGM&#x27;s extensive customer database. Later that year, the resort joined K Hotels, a worldwide collection of approximately 50 hotels. Amid the recession, Ruffin spent $20 million on various changes to target a middle-class clientele. The hotel rooms were left untouched, as MGM had conducted a $92 million renovation of them shortly before selling the resort to Ruffin.

A rooftop swamp cooler caught fire in July 2012, sending smoke through hallways of the upper hotel floors, which were evacuated. The fire caused $20,000 in damage, but resulted in only minor injuries for guests.

Ruffin is a business partner of Donald Trump&#x27;s and a supporter of his presidential campaign. Trump has held several campaign rallies at Treasure Island, including one in 2016 during which an audience member attempted to assassinate him.

In 2019, Treasure Island&#x27;s hotel joined Radisson Hotel Group. Under the agreement, the resort kept its name and exterior signage. Room renovations began that year. State casinos were temporarily closed in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nevada, and the closure allowed planned renovations across the resort to accelerate. Among the additions was an expanded sportsbook.

==Features==

Treasure Island includes a casino, and has 2,885 rooms, located in a 36-story tower. As part of the 2003 transformation, the tower was given a darker paint color, using 6,200 gallons of terra cotta/&quot;Salmon Stream&quot; paint, replacing an earlier pink coloring. Treasure Island received a Four Diamond Award every year from 1999 to 2013.

Tangerine, a nightclub featuring an orange and white interior, operated from 2004 to 2007. Fashion designer Christian Audigier opened an eponymous nightclub at Treasure Island in 2008, in partnership with Pure Management Group. The decor included rhinestone-encrusted skulls and two large tanks containing jellyfish. Audigier said, &quot;When you&#x27;re going into a club, you want to see sparkling and glitter and rhinestones&quot;. Christian Audigier did not perform as well as Ruffin would have liked, prompting its closure in 2010. Ruffin&#x27;s other changes included a $3 million makeover of the spa, with renovations overseen by his wife Oleksandra Nikolayenko. At one point, Treasure Island had of convention space, which received a $4 million renovation in 2012. Four years later, the space was expanded to .

In 2013, the resort announced plans to build a three-story mall, replacing the northern portion of the pirate lagoon area. It was completed two years later, and includes a CVS Pharmacy on the first floor. At the end of 2015, the resort announced that it would lease the upper floors to Victory Hill Exhibitions. In 2016, the company opened the Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N., an interactive self-guided exhibit based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The Mirage-Treasure Island Tram traveled between the two resorts. It ceased operations in June 2024 prior to The Mirage&#x27;s closing on July 17, 2024.

===Theme and design===

Various themes were considered for the resort, until a friend of Wynn&#x27;s suggested the name &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, resulting in a pirate theme. It is named after the 1880s novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson. The resort was designed by Joel Bergman, who previously designed the Mirage. Bergman designed the Treasure Island tower with a floorplan that branched out three ways in a Y-shape, with elevators in the center. This was done for convenience to guests, making the walk to their rooms brief. The Y-shape was modeled after the Mirage hotel tower.

Wynn&#x27;s Atlandia Design worked with Jon Jerde and Olio Design to create the pirate village and lagoon area, originally known as Buccaneer Bay, and later as Siren&#x27;s Cove. During the design phase, the hotel&#x27;s lobby entrance was moved to the resort&#x27;s south side, in order to maintain Buccaneer Bay&#x27;s location on the east side along the Strip. Jerde&#x27;s assistants traveled across Europe, India and Nepal searching for historic objects such as doors and columns, which were then replicated for Buccaneer Bay. The lagoon is 65 feet deep, and originally contained 2 million gallons of water. It uses wastewater recycled from a water treatment plant located beneath the resort&#x27;s parking garage. A maintenance team, including divers, works to keep the lagoon clean.
According to interior designer Roger Thomas, &quot;We thought it would be great fun to create a pirate village with sinking ships and pyrotechnics. The day after it opened we all looked at each other and said, &#x27;What have we done? This is so not us&#x27;&quot;. Executives realized that the resort&#x27;s heavy pirate theme did not appeal to people interested in a weekend getaway. By 1998, efforts had begun to downplay the theme. Mirage conducted focus group testing to determine upcoming renovation plans for Treasure Island. A $60 million remodeling of the hotel rooms took place in 1999.

The resort initially included a roadside sign featuring an 8,000-pound pirate skull, made of fiberglass and measuring 27 1/2 feet. The skull sign was removed on July 10, 2003, in a ceremony accompanied by fireworks. Sibella said, &quot;It&#x27;s a cool sign, but it needs to complement what we&#x27;re doing inside&quot;, referring to the property&#x27;s revamp. The skull portion was donated to the city&#x27;s Neon Museum, while much of the remaining sign was scrapped. The sign was replaced by an LED neon &quot;TI&quot; sign with a modern and sophisticated design. The new sign measures 137 feet high and 84 feet wide.

Various pirate memorabilia had been removed from the resort over the course of three years, and was auctioned in September 2003.

===Restaurants===

Treasure Island opened with several restaurants, including Buccaneer Bay Club, which overlooked the lagoon and its pirate shows. Its menu included steak and seafood. A fine-dining Italian restaurant, Francesco&#x27;s, was added in 1998. It featured artwork by celebrities such as Tony Bennett and Phyllis Diller.

The arcade was replaced in 2001 by a tropical-themed restaurant and bar named Kahunaville, part of efforts to appeal to a more-adult demographic. Kahunaville included a dinner show space for live entertainment. A new buffet, Dishes, was added in 2005. An Asian restaurant known as Social House opened a year later, replacing Buccaneer Bay Club.
Ruffin made numerous restaurant changes upon taking ownership. In 2009, he replaced Francesco&#x27;s with a pizzeria by the same name, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s quick and it&#x27;s cheap and that&#x27;s what people are looking for these days&quot;. Ruffin also replaced Social House with his own Asian restaurant, Khotan, featuring jade and ivory antiques from his personal collection. In 2010, he opened Gilley&#x27;s Saloon, a popular Western-themed restaurant, bar and dance hall. It previously operated at Ruffin&#x27;s New Frontier hotel-casino, which closed in 2007. The new location replaced Treasure Island&#x27;s Mist Lounge.

In 2012, Ruffin opened a Señor Frog&#x27;s restaurant and bar to complement Kahunaville and Gilley&#x27;s. It replaced Christian Audigier and Khotan, the latter relocating elsewhere in the resort. Another new restaurant, Seafood Shack, also opened in 2012. Its interior was created with recycled materials, including reclaimed wood which lines the walls. The restaurant&#x27;s centerpiece is an anchor pulled from the Atlantic Ocean. The resort also has Phil&#x27;s Steak House, named after Ruffin. Kahunaville closed in 2016.

==Live entertainment==

Treasure Island opened with the free &quot;Battle of Buccaneer Bay&quot; pirate show, performed in the lagoon along the Strip. The 15-minute show was performed several times a day and featured 22 actors. It depicted the landing and subsequent sacking of a Caribbean village by pirates, serving to attract customers from the Strip and into the resort after each show in the same fashion as the volcano fronting the Mirage resort. Notable special effects included a full-scale, crewed British Royal Navy sailing ship that sailed nearly the full width of the property, a gas-fired &quot;powder magazine&quot; explosion, pyrotechnics, and the sinking of the sailing ship &quot;Brittania&quot; along with its captain.

&quot;Battle of Buccaneer Bay&quot; held its final performance on July 6, 2003, with a total of 16,334 shows performed over the course of nearly 10 years. It ended as part of the resort&#x27;s ongoing revamp, which would include a new pirate show. Sibella described the original show as something that would be expected at Disneyland, while calling its successor a &quot;sexy and beautiful, adult Broadway-caliber show.&quot;
The new &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; pirate show debuted in October 2003, marking the resort&#x27;s 10th anniversary. The Buccaneer Bay was renamed Sirens&#x27; Cove and the new show utilized many of the technical elements of its predecessor. The live, free show was intended to appeal more to adults by including singing, dancing, audio-visual effects, bare-chested pirates and attractive women in the large outdoor show produced by Kenny Ortega. The original two ships were kept for the new show but repainted and altered, as well as some special effects.

&quot;Sirens of TI&quot; was closed on October 21, 2013. The closure was initially intended to be temporary, but was made permanent the following month, to the dismay of the show&#x27;s actors. The reason cited by Treasure Island was the construction of the new retail space nearby. The shows had cost $5 million to put on annually. While Ruffin said the shows brought &quot;a tremendous amount of attention&quot; to Treasure Island, they amounted to minimal foot traffic inside the resort. The pirate ships remain on display in the lagoon, and are lit up at night.

Treasure Island is home to Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s &quot;Mystère&quot;, which introduced the entertainment style of Franco Dragone. It opened on December 25, 1993, and has been voted nine times as the best production show in the city by the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; reader&#x27;s poll. It is Cirque&#x27;s longest-running Las Vegas show, reaching 13,000 performances in 2022. &quot;Mystère&quot; has been updated several times throughout its run. It takes place in a 1,600-seat theater, designed by Scéno Plus. To maximize use of the Mystère theater, Ruffin signed entertainers to perform there on nights when the show is not running. Such entertainers have included Bill Cosby, LeAnn Rimes, and Sinbad. The resort has also hosted boxing matches.

==In popular culture==
An hour-long promotional program, &quot;Treasure Island: The Adventure Begins&quot;, aired on NBC in January 1994. It stars Corey Carrier as a 12-year-old on vacation with his parents at the resort. There, he meets and teams up with Long John Silver (Anthony Zerbe) to find lost treasure. Mirage Resorts paid NBC $1.7 million to air the program. It was directed and produced by Scott Garen, and written by James V. Hart. The special includes an appearance by Wynn, and incorporates the Dunes&#x27; implosion as its climax. The program received low viewership ratings, and was considered an infomercial by critics, who lambasted NBC for not labeling it as such.

Treasure Island has been shown or referenced in other media as well:
* In the 2004 movie &quot;&quot;, while Steve the Pirate is walking down Fremont Street, someone drives by yelling &quot;Go back to Treasure Island&quot;. An alternative ending to the movie was that the Average Joes lost the dodgeball tournament, but got their money back when Steve won it at Treasure Island.
* Treasure Island appears in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; under the name &quot;Pirates in Men&#x27;s Pants&quot;, a pun referencing &quot;Pirates of Penzance&quot;.
* The resort was a major production location for the 2005 film &quot;Miss Congeniality 2&quot;, which included filming of the &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; show.
* In the 2007 film &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, Ben (Seth Rogen) and Pete (Paul Rudd) see &quot;Mystère&quot; at Treasure Island during their visit to Las Vegas.

<doc id="697657" wikidata="Q14875404" url="?curid=697657" title="Richmond, Ontario">
<text>Richmond is a rural village within the amalgamated City of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1818, it spans the Jock River, a tributary of the Rideau River. A part of the National Capital Region, Richmond is located southwest of Kanata and immediately south to the community of Stittsville.

==History==
After the War of 1812, loyal settlers were sought for Upper Canada (now Ontario). The United Empire Loyalists, who, after the American Revolution, had helped to settle areas further south and west in Upper Canada were being regarded with increasing suspicion. Instead, disbanded soldiers were the most immediate loyal settlers for this new era of development.

Richmond was originally laid out for the Government in 1817 by Major George Thew Burke, and settlement commenced as early as 1818. This was a military point for a number of years. Later renamed the Jock River. The Masonic Arms Tavern, his abode on the previous night, was renamed Duke of Richmond Tavern in his honour. Richmond derives its name from the Duke of Richmond.

Richmond was selected by the British Army in 1818 as one of the first military settlements. Others included Perth and Lanark. Named after the Duke of Richmond, who was the newly appointed Governor General of the Canadas, Richmond was laid out in a grid on the north bank of the Jock River (which for a while was renamed the Goodwood after the Duke’s English estate). Richmond was the centre for the administration of lands in the area. Military supervisor, Major Burke, placed mainly Irish soldiers of his 99th Regiment in Goulbourn. Scottish settlers from Perthshire were placed in the adjoining area of northeast Beckwith, while Irish civilians were settled in southeast Beckwith, Goulbourn, and other parts of the neighbouring townships.

In the spring of 1818 the officers and men of 99th were at Quebec, and, in common with those of other regiments, had their choice of a passage home to Ireland or, if they so elected, to remain here in Canada where they would receive free grants of land in the new country to be settled on the Ottawa and Rideau rivers. Thus, in late 1818 (with the help of neighbours in Hull, Quebec assisting in construction) Richmond was born.
From 1818 to 1822, Richmond was managed by the Settling Branch of Upper Canada&#x27;s Military Department. Life was dominated by military culture and institutions during these early years. While official plans demonstrate an optimism for its future growth and importance, this never came to pass. By the time the military relinquished control of Richmond in 1822, very few civilians had settled. In the case of Richmond, the rising importance of Bytown and the building of the Rideau Canal several kilometres east of Richmond significantly contributed to its failure to thrive. By 1832, Hamnett Pinhey described the state of Richmond to the Freeholders of Carleton as, &quot;a jail in itself.&quot; He goes on to note that, &quot;I have known that place these thirteen years, it was then a rising place, but it has been falling ever since, and is now almost nothing; not a house has been built but many a one has fallen down and still are falling... if you get into it in the Spring, you can&#x27;t get out till Summer; and if you get into it in the Fall, you must wait till the Winter, and whose fault is it but the Magistrates and Gentry of Richmond; that is to say the Shopkeepers?&quot;

Richmond was incorporated on Goodwood river, in the east corner of the township of Goulbourn, 21 miles from Ottawa City, and 11 miles from the Ottawa river in 1850. For a number of years the trade and business was very active, but by the 1860s appears to have declined. By 1866, with a population of 600, contained several general stores, flouring mills and tannery; a grammar school, building of frame, W. Houghton, master. There were four churches-Church of England, built of stone, Rev. J. C. B. Pettit, rector; Church of Scotland, building of frame, Rev. Wm. P. White, minister; Wesleyan Methodist, building of frame; and the Roman Catholic church, built of stone, Rev. Peter O&#x27;Connell, parish priest.

It was annexed by Goulbourn Township in 1974. In 1969, Richmond became part of Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton until 2001. It has been within the City of Ottawa since January 1, 2001. Some residents in Richmond are displeased about the most recent amalgamation into the Ottawa city structure and would like to de-amalgamate along with other areas of rural Carleton County.

=== Richmond Bakery ===

The original Richmond Bakery started in the late 1800s when Sam Wright came from Kemptville and opened a bakery business on Strachan Street. It was sold in 1900 to Sam Wright, who operated the business until 1926.
In 1930, Harold Brown rented a bakeshop and opened the Richmond Bakery on McBean Street which had a wood-fired brick oven, a few utensils and a kerosene lamp for lighting because there was no electricity. All the water was hand pumped from a well and carried to the bakery. Bread sold for 3 cents a loaf to retailers, who in turn sold it for 5 cents and the baker usually worked 16 hours per day. To deliver the bread, Mr. Brown borrowed horses from the local farmers and fed the horses in return. Drivers had to feed the horses at 4 a.m. and usually didn’t finish deliveries until 7 p.m. covering 20–25 miles per day. After being discharged from the RCAF in 1945, Mr. Brown opened another bakery in Richmond on McBean Street. Although it had electricity and trucks to do the deliveries, water still had to be pumped by hand and carried to the bakery.

In 1952, Mr. Brown moved the Richmond Bakery to the corner of McBean and Perth Streets and new equipment was purchased including, gas and oil ovens, revolving trays and a bread steamer. Water was finally pumped into the bakery with an electric pump. At the new location, Mr. Brown added pastries which became one of the attractions of the bakers.

On August 11, 2014, the Richmond Bakery closed its doors suddenly after 75 years in business. The owner stated that challenges he faced trying to find experienced bakers was the reason for closing.

==Today==

The mascot is a fox. Richmond has many historical buildings such as St Philip&#x27;s Church, which is the oldest church in the Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa, and St John the Baptist Anglican Church, established in 1822 with the first sanctuary built in 1823; the oldest parish in now what is the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa. 

Popular sports in Richmond include baseball, soccer, curling, and ice hockey. The Rideau Trail runs through Richmond. The Ottawa-Carleton Catholic School Board runs an elementary school named St. Philip. The public Ottawa-Carleton District School Board operates an elementary school named Richmond Public School and a high school named South Carleton High School. Residents can take RR 10 in travelling to Carleton Place, Perth, or Smith Falls. They may also take the Highway 416, To Prescott or Ottawa. Richmond Road also meanders to downtown Ottawa. Richmond has a Scout Troop. Bus service to Ottawa is through the OC Transpo.

Richmond has a selection of shops and services including a LCBO, banks, drugstore, grocer, and several restaurants.

=== Amalgamation ===
Richmond was amalgamated into the city of Ottawa in 2001.

<text>Marcus Furius Bibaculus (1st century BC) was a Roman poet who flourished during the last century of the Republic.

==Life==
According to Jerome, he was born at Cremona, in 103 BC; however, scholars believe that this date is much too early and that he seems to be a contemporary of Catullus. Like Catullus, he wrote satirical poems in the same style. It is conjectured that he is the friend whom Catullus jokingly satirises in poems 16, 23, and 26.

He wrote satirical poems after the manner of Catullus, whose bitterness he rivaled, according to Quintilian (&quot;Instit.&quot; x.i.196), in his iambics. He even attacked Augustus (and perhaps Caesar), who treated the matter with indifference. He was also author of prose &quot;Lucubrationes&quot; and perhaps of an epic poem on Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars (&quot;Pragmatia Belli Gallici&quot;).

Otto Ribbeck attributes to him one of the shorter poems usually assigned to Virgil. It is doubtful whether he is the person ridiculed by Horace (&quot;Satires,&quot; ii.5.40) and whether he is identical with the &quot;turgidus Alpinus&quot; (&quot;Satires,&quot; i.10.36), the author of an &quot;Aethiopis&quot; dealing with the life and death of Memnon and of a poem on the Rhine. Some critics, on the ground that Horace would not have ventured to attack so dangerous an adversary, assume the existence of a poet whose real name was Furius (or Cornelius) Alpinus.

Bibaculus was ridiculed for his high-flown and exaggerated style and manner of expression. Fragments of his work can be found in L. Müller&#x27;s edition of Catullus&#x27;s work in the Teubner Series (1870).

<doc id="697666" wikidata="Q4548693" url="?curid=697666" title="Structural rule">
<text>In the logical discipline of proof theory, a structural rule is an inference rule of a sequent calculus that does not refer to any logical connective but instead operates on the sequents directly. Structural rules often mimic the intended meta-theoretic properties of the logic. Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics.

==Common structural rules==
Three common structural rules are:

* Weakening, where the hypotheses or conclusion of a sequence may be extended with additional members. In symbolic form weakening rules can be written as formula_1 on the left of the turnstile, and formula_2 on the right. Known as monotonicity of entailment in classical logic.

* Contraction, where two equal (or unifiable) members on the same side of a sequent may be replaced by a single member (or common instance). Symbolically: formula_3 and formula_4. Also known as factoring in automated theorem proving systems using resolution. Known as idempotency of entailment in classical logic.
* Exchange, where two members on the same side of a sequent may be swapped. Symbolically: formula_5 and formula_6. (This is also known as the &quot;permutation rule&quot;.)

A logic without any of the above structural rules would interpret the sides of a sequent as pure sequences; with exchange, they can be considered to be multisets; and with both contraction and exchange they can be considered to be sets.

These are not the only possible structural rules. A famous structural rule is known as cut. Considerable effort is spent by proof theorists in showing that cut rules are superfluous in various logics. More precisely, what is shown is that cut is only (in a sense) a tool for abbreviating proofs, and does not add to the theorems that can be proved. The successful &#x27;removal&#x27; of cut rules, known as &quot;cut elimination&quot;, is directly related to the philosophy of &quot;computation as normalization&quot; (see Curry–Howard correspondence); it often gives a good indication of the complexity of deciding a given logic.

<doc id="697672" wikidata="Q86904" url="?curid=697672" title="Schiller Institute">
<text>The Schiller Institute is a German-based political and economic think tank founded in 1984 by Helga Zepp-LaRouche, with stated members in 50 countries. It is among the principal front organizations of the LaRouche movement. The institute&#x27;s stated aim is to apply the ideas of the poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller to what it calls the &quot;contemporary world crisis.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; describes it as &quot;an extremist political think-tank linked to a right-wing conspiracy theorist, Lyndon LaRouche.&quot; According to &quot;The Times&quot;, its aim is &quot;to propagate [LaRouche&#x27;s] increasingly wild anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.&quot;

The website of the Schiller Institute includes transcripts of conferences that the institute has sponsored, throughout North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, to promote the idea of what it calls &quot;peace through development&quot;. The discussion at these conferences centers around LaRouche&#x27;s proposals for infrastructure projects such as the &quot;Eurasian Land Bridge&quot;, and the &quot;Oasis Plan&quot;, a Middle East peace agreement based on Arab-Israeli collaboration on major water projects, as well as proposals for debt relief and a sweeping reorganization of the world monetary system. The Institute opposes the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; thesis of Samuel Huntington, counter-posing what it calls a &quot;Dialogue of Cultures&quot;. It supports the Belt and Road Initiative, which it says provides &quot;shared mutually beneficial and balanced development&quot;.

It publishes quarterly magazines, such as &quot;Fidelio&quot;, a Journal of Poetry, Science, and Statecraft, and &quot;Ibykus&quot;, named after Schiller&#x27;s poem &quot;The Cranes of Ibykus.&quot;

After the death of Jeremiah Duggan, a Jewish student, at one of its conferences in 2003, the Institute was accused of antisemitism and cult-like operation.

==Founding==
The institute was founded at a conference in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1984 by Helga Zepp-LaRouche, the German-born wife of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche. Its stated aim is to seek to apply the ideas of poet, dramatist and philosopher Friedrich Schiller to the current global political situation. They emphasize Schiller&#x27;s concept of the interdependence of classical artistic beauty and republican political freedom, as elaborated in his series of essays entitled &quot;Letters on the Aesthetical Education of Man.&quot;

On November 26, 1984, the institute released a &quot;Declaration of the Inalienable Rights of Man,&quot; which it describes as &quot;the basis of the Institute&#x27;s work and efforts worldwide.&quot; It states in part:


Zepp-LaRouche has explained the need for the Schiller Institute as follows:

Among the past and present members of the institute&#x27;s board of directors are Helga Zepp-LaRouche, Webster Tarpley, Civil rights leader Amelia Boynton Robinson, former South Carolina State Assemblyman Theo Mitchell, classical singer William Warfield, former Guyanese Foreign Minister Frederick Wills, physicist Winston H. Bostick, and former Borough President of Manhattan Hulan Jack. Among the founding members of the institute were Hulan Jack and French Resistance leader Marie-Madeleine Fourcade.

==Political activity==

The Institute&#x27;s constitution, adopted in 1984, opposes international financial institutions and other supranational bodies for causing a state of tyranny in the world, especially amongst developing nations.

The Institute website includes transcripts of conferences that the institute has sponsored worldwide to promote the idea of what it calls &quot;peace through development&quot;. The discussion at these conferences has generally centered around LaRouche&#x27;s proposals for infrastructure projects such as the &quot;Eurasian Land Bridge&quot;, and the &quot;Oasis Plan&quot;, a Middle East peace agreement based on Arab-Israeli collaboration on major water projects. The conferences also typically discuss proposals for debt relief and the &quot;New Bretton Woods,&quot; a proposal for a sweeping reorganization of the world monetary system (see Political views of Lyndon LaRouche). The Institute strongly opposes the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; thesis of Samuel Huntington, counterposing what it calls a &quot;Dialogue of Cultures&quot;.

According to the LaRouche movement&#x27;s &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot;, LaRouche formed a group called the &quot;Committee to Save the Presidency&quot; to fight the international financiers who he said were behind an attempted coup against President Bill Clinton. Schiller Institute collected petition signatures defending Clinton, and picketed the U.S. Capitol in 1999 with signs that said &quot;Save the Presidency! Jail Kenneth &#x27;Porno&#x27; Starr&quot;. A Schiller Institute spokesperson said &quot;This is a coup to overthrow the United States government and disenfranchise the American electorate&quot;.

The Institute proposed for a national Maglev train system in Denmark in 2007. In the 2007 Danish elections there were four candidates for parliament affiliated with the Institute. They received 197 votes nationwide (while at least 32,000 are needed for a local mandate). The candidates garnered press coverage, including an interview with Tom Gillesberg in &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot;, which discussed the slogan of the LaRouche slate, &quot;After the financial crash, Maglev over Kattegat.&quot;.

In March 2009, the Danish branch of the institute distributed flyers at a climate change conference in Copenhagen which asserted that &quot;British Climate lies will lead to Genocide&quot;, stating that the Bush administration had been a puppet of the British Empire, that &quot;solar activity, not human activity, is the main factor in the Earth&#x27;s changing climate,&quot; and that &quot;massive investment in windmills and solar panels&quot; to combat climate change would create genocide by raising the price of food.

In 2016, speakers at its conference in Australia included UK Labour Party MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Michael Meacher and UK Conservative Party activist Robert Oulds. Corbyn spoke on “the dangers embodied in NATO’s eastward expansion, the hideous aftermath of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, and the impact of Britain’s al-Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia for the money flows in the Middle East, including those connected with terrorism”.

The Institute supports for Donald Trump, who they said in 2019 was being ousted in a &quot;seditious coup&quot;. It supports Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

==Cultural activity==

It held a conference on Saint Augustine in Rome in 1985. Its Labor Day conference in Reston, Virginia, 1986, featured a performance of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem at C. In 1990 it held a conference on infrastructure in Berlin. In 1993 its Khartoum conference on religions was sponsored by the government of Sudan. In 1997, a conference in Manila featured Jozef Mikloško, president of the Slovakian branch of the Schiller Institute and former vice premier of Czechoslovakia. In 2000, it held a Memorial seminar for Russian Schiller Institute leader Taras V. Muranivsky in Moscow, Russia.

===&quot;Fidelio&quot;===
The institute has published its quarterly magazine, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, since 1992, described as a &quot;Journal of Poetry, Science, and Statecraft.&quot; It was co-founded and edited by Kenneth Kronberg. The magazine is named after Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s opera, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, which tells the story of a political prisoner who is freed by the courage of his wife. At the time the magazine was founded, Lyndon LaRouche was still in prison.

Its issues have included articles on Homer, Henry VII, Benjamin Franklin, Gottfried Leibniz, the &quot;Vier ernste Gesänge&quot; of Johannes Brahms, Vice President Dick Cheney, Paul Kreingold&#x27;s “I.L. Peretz, Father of the Yiddish Renaissance”, and reviews of books, art exhibits, and musical, and dramatic performances.

===Verdi tuning===

In 1988, the institute initiated a campaign to establish &quot;philosophical pitch&quot; or &quot;scientific pitch&quot; as the classical music concert pitch standard. This tuning system is based on middle C set at 256 Hz, making concert A 430.539 Hz rather than the most commonly used 440 Hz. The Schiller Institute calls this system &quot;Verdi tuning&quot; because it was Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi who first sought to stop the increase in pitch to which orchestras are tuned. However, Verdi used the French standard 435 Hz in writing his &quot;Requiem&quot; in 1874; later he indicated that 432 Hz was slightly more optimal. It is this A=432 Hz standard that the Schiller Institute advocates, which aligns mathematically with their stated preference for C=256 Hz as long as Pythagorean tuning is used (in equal temperament or just intonation, A would be 430.541 Hz or 426.667 Hz, respectively). French acoustic physicist Joseph Sauveur first researched then proposed the philosophical pitch standard in 1713, more than a century before Verdi began leading orchestras. Sauveur was strongly resisted by the musicians he was working with, and the proposed standard was not adopted.

In 1999, the institute circulated a petition calling for the establishment of a permanent orchestra in Verdi&#x27;s childhood home in Busseto, Italy, employing the special tuning in order to mark the composer&#x27;s centennial.

The tuning initiative is opposed by Stefan Zucker. According to Zucker, the Institute offered a bill in Italy to impose the Verdi tuning on state-sponsored musicians that included provisions for fines and confiscation of non-Verdi tuning forks. Zucker has written that he believes the claims about the Verdi tuning are historically inaccurate. Institute followers are reported by Tim Page of &quot;Newsday&quot; to have stood outside concert halls with petitions to ban the music of Vivaldi and even to have disrupted a concert conducted by Leonard Slatkin in order to pass out pamphlets titled &quot;Leonard Slatkin Serves Satan.&quot;

===Other music initiatives===
In 1992, the institute published &quot;A Manual on the Rudiments of Tuning and Registration: Book I: Introduction and Human Singing Voice&quot;, which discusses the tuning issue from the artistic and the scientific point of view. The Institute asserts the Bel Canto method of singing is &quot;one of the best examples of mankind&#x27;s ability to discover an existing physical principle, and to use that discovery to create new works of science and art, which then increase humanity&#x27;s power to build civilization.&quot; They also assert that composers such as J.S. Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Giuseppe Verdi all wrote with the distinct vocal registers of the Bel Canto system in mind, and that their compositions intentionally exploit the different tone colors that these registers produce.

In 2010, 25 LaRouche supporters protesting a new production of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; presented by the Los Angeles Opera carried signs that said, &quot;Wagner: Loved by Nazis, Rejected by Humans&quot; and &quot;L.A. County: $14 Million to promote Nazi Wagner, Layoffs for Music Teachers&quot;. They distributed flyers from the Schiller Institute which asked &quot;Does Los Angeles County have nothing better to do ... than bail out L.A. Opera, so that it can celebrate the monstrous sexual fantasies, and the cult of violence, of that vile anti-Semite, Wagner?&quot;

The Schiller Institute presented a performance of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, on January 19, 2014, the 50th anniversary of the performance of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem and pontifical mass for John F. Kennedy which was held at the Cathedral. Remarks were made by Ambassador Ray Flynn, and a letter was read from Irish President Michael D. Higgins. Recordings of speeches by President Kennedy were also featured.

===Drama and poetry===
The institute has published a four-volume series of English translations of the works of Friedrich Schiller, entitled &quot;Poet of Freedom&quot;, as well as some translations into other languages.

== Ties to the LaRouche movement ==

The Schiller Institute is closely tied to Lyndon LaRouche. The institute&#x27;s website states that &quot;[i]t is his work and his ideas, [which] inspired the creation of the international Schiller Institute, as well as his intellectual and moral leadership that continue to set the standard for the policies and activity of the movement.&quot; LaRouche&#x27;s writings are featured prominently in Schiller Institute communications. Before his death in 2019, LaRouche was the keynote speaker at most of the Schiller Institute&#x27;s conferences.

==Criticism and controversies==
===Death of Jeremiah Duggan===

In 2003, Jeremiah Duggan, a student who had been attending a Schiller Institute conference in Germany, died. Duggan had been attending a Schiller Institute conference and LaRouche Youth Movement cadre school in Wiesbaden, Germany, at which Lyndon LaRouche spoke. Duggan died after running onto a busy road. The German police investigation found that he had committed suicide. A British inquest rejected that verdict after hearing testimony about the nature of the Schiller Institute.

===Allegations of antisemitism===
Following Duggan&#x27;s death, the Schiller Institute was accused of spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories. According to Duggan&#x27;s mother,In Jerry&#x27;s notes on the five days he spent there, Mrs Duggan discovered that her son had become aware of the anti-Semitic agenda of many LaRouche followers and had spoken out against them. &quot;There were a lot of comments blaming the Jews for Iraq and he got up to say that he was Jewish and he didn&#x27;t support the war,&quot; she said. &quot;Whatever happened it&#x27;s clear he fell out with these people very quickly.&quot;According to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Seminar participants were told that the war had been concocted by a tightly knit group of Jewish bankers with immense political influence over the US Administration.&quot; An internal London Metropolitan Police (Scotland Yard) letter, obtained by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; during a British investigation into the death says: &quot;The Schiller Institute and the LaRouche Youth Movement... blames the Jewish people for the Iraq war and all the other problems in the world. Jeremiah&#x27;s lecture notes and bulletins showed the antisemitic nature of [the] ideology.&quot; 

In an interview with &quot;Newsnight&quot;, Chip Berlet of Political Research Associates, an American research group that tracks right-wing movements, said:
The German newspaper &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; also categorizes the Schiller Institute as antisemitic.

The Schiller Institute issued a statement in response to the controversy, calling it &quot;a politically motivated smear job&quot; based on &quot;conspiracy theories,&quot; and alleged that the Institute was being targeted because of its opposition to the Iraq War.

A 2008 academic publication by Matthew Feldman, a researcher on the far right, described the &quot;role of the Schiller Institute in disseminating ‘revisionism’, essentially coded anti-Semitic Holocaust denial, incitement to racial hatred, and radical right propaganda more broadly.&quot;

===Cult allegations===
Following the 2003 death of Duggan, cult allegations were made. According to the &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot;, the LaRouche movement in Germany, operating as the Schiller Institute, LaRouche Youth Movement, &quot;Europäische Arbeiterpartei&quot; and &quot;Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität&quot; (&quot;BüSo&quot;), had around 300 followers in 2007, and &quot;next to Scientology, [was] the cult soliciting most aggressively in German streets at [that] time.&quot;

The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; has said the institute places members under &quot;psychological duress,&quot; during &quot;so-called psycho sessions.&quot; Aglaja Beyes Corleis, a member of the Schiller Institute for 16 years, who left in the early 1990s and wrote a book about the Institute, told the BBC:
On November 6, 2003, a British inquest heard allegations that the Schiller Institute is a
&quot;political cult with sinister and dangerous connections.&quot; which may have used controversial recruitment techniques on Duggan.

===Death of Kenneth Kronberg===

Kenneth Kronberg, co-founder and editor of the Schiller Institute&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and the president of a LaRouche movement printing business, committed suicide in April 2007. According to Nicholas F. Benton, a former member of the LaRouche movement, Kronberg killed himself on the day that a so-called &quot;morning briefing&quot; (published daily by the LaRouche movement) heavily criticized Kronberg&#x27;s printing business. Kronberg&#x27;s printing business was also reported to be in financial trouble, the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; described the companies finances as being &quot;in perilous shape. Various LaRouche organizations owed Kronberg hundreds of thousands of dollars. When the IRS and Virginia tax authorities came calling over withholding payments, Ken knew he was in serious trouble.&quot;

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Schiller Institute held an international discussion which concluded that &quot;the confrontation with Russia is detrimental to Germany and the EU&quot;. The Ukrainian government Center for Countering Disinformation said the conclusion was &quot;an attempt by Russia to impose their point of view on the world&quot;.

&quot;Zepp-LaRouche often resorts to distorting facts from history.&quot;

<text>The Second Military District of the U.S. Army was one of five temporary administrative units of the U.S. War Department that existed in the American South. The district was stipulated by the Reconstruction Acts during the Reconstruction period following the American Civil War. It included the territories of North and South Carolina, and acted as the de facto military government of those states while a new civilian government was being re-established. It was headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina. Originally commanded by Major General Daniel Sickles, after his removal by President Andrew Johnson on August 26, 1867, Brigadier General Edward Canby took over command until both states were readmitted in July 1868.

Its successor was the Department of the South.

<text>Charles Wilber Rogan (July 28, 1893 – March 4, 1967), nicknamed &quot;Bullet Joe&quot;, was an American pitcher, outfielder, and player-manager for the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro baseball leagues from 1920 to 1938. Renowned as a two-way player who could both hit and pitch successfully, one statistical compilation shows Rogan winning more games than any other pitcher in Negro leagues history and ranking fourth highest in career batting average. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998.

Rogan&#x27;s early baseball career took place in the U.S. Army, where he played for a famous team in the all-black 25th Infantry. After joining the Kansas City Monarchs, he was the top pitcher and one of the best hitters on a team that won three pennants from 1923 to 1925 and the 1924 Colored World Series. In addition to pitching and hitting, Rogan started managing in 1926 and led his team to another league title in 1929.

&quot;Charleston was everything—but Rogan was more&quot;, said William &quot;Big C&quot; Johnson, one of Rogan&#x27;s Army teammates. &quot;Rogan could do everything, everywhere.&quot; &quot;He was the onliest pitcher I ever saw, I ever heard of in my life, was pitching and hitting in the cleanup place&quot;, said Satchel Paige. According to Rogan&#x27;s longtime catcher Frank Duncan, &quot;If you had to choose between Rogan and Paige, you&#x27;d pick Rogan, because he could hit. The pitching, you&#x27;d as soon have Satchel as Rogan, understand? But Rogan&#x27;s &quot;hitting&quot; was so terrific. Get my point?&quot; Casey Stengel called Rogan &quot;one of the best—if not the best—pitcher that ever lived.&quot;

==Early life==
Charles Wilber Rogan was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 

After the death of his mother and his father&#x27;s remarriage in 1908, he moved with his family to Kansas City, Kansas, where he attended Sumner High School. He began his baseball career there in 1911 as a catcher with Fred Palace&#x27;s Colts, a semipro team composed mostly of teenagers. Also joining the Colts that season was Dick Whitworth, who would, like Rogan, go on to pitch for many years in the Negro leagues.

Friction with his stepmother and unhappiness with the segregated high school he attended led Rogan to drop out of school before graduation and enlist in the Army on October 19, 1911. He lied about his age to do so. This would cause later confusion about Rogan&#x27;s age, as some records (along with his Hall of Fame plaque) give his birth year as 1889, others as 1893; recent histories, such as Phil Dixon&#x27;s, conclude that the latter date is correct.

==U.S. Army and the 25th Infantry Wreckers==
Rogan served in the Philippines during American colonization with the 24th Infantry Regiment, an all-black regiment, for three years. He was honorably discharged in 1914.

Before returning to the United States, Rogan reenlisted, this time with the 25th Infantry, another African American unit, at that time stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. He was specifically recruited to play for the regiment&#x27;s famous baseball team, known as the &quot;Wreckers.&quot; He made his debut with the Wreckers on July 4, 1915.

His Army teammates included a number of later Negro league stars, such as Dobie Moore, Heavy Johnson, Bob Fagan, Lemuel Hawkins, and William &quot;Big C&quot; Johnson. Over the next three seasons, the Wreckers won the Post League championship, the United States Army Series, and the Oahu League. In February 1917 Rogan twice defeated the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, who were visiting the islands for spring training. On furlough for several months in 1917, Rogan played professionally for the Los Angeles White Sox, the Kansas City, Kansas, Giants, and J. L. Wilkinson&#x27;s All Nations Club, but returned to the army for three more years.

In August 1918 Rogan and the rest of the 25th Infantry were moved to Camp Stephen D. Little in Nogales, Arizona. Researchers John Holway and James Riley report that in 1919, Casey Stengel played against Rogan in Arizona, and subsequently recommended him to Wilkinson for his new Negro National League team, the Kansas City Monarchs. However, Rogan had already played in the California Winter League and for Wilkinson&#x27;s All-Nations team in 1917, and had already been noted by African American newspapers as early as 1916.

==Professional career==

In July 1920, Rogan and Dobie Moore joined the Monarchs. Rogan quickly became the premier pitcher and biggest box-office draw in the young league. By his third season with the Monarchs, 1922, he hit .390, and his 13 home runs were good for second in the league. On August 6, 1923, Rogan combined with teammate and manager José Méndez to pitch a no-hitter against the Milwaukee Bears, Méndez pitching the first five innings and Rogan the last four. That season he hit .364 with a league-leading 16 wins and 151 strikeouts to lead the Monarchs to their first pennant.

In 1924 Rogan hit .395 while compiling an 18–6 record and leading the Monarchs to their second league title. He starred in the first Black World Series, leading the Monarchs with 13 hits and winning two games as Kansas City defeated the Eastern Colored League champion Hilldales. That winter he led the 1924/25 Cuban League with nine victories for the champion Almendares club.

Rogan may have reached his peak in 1925, leading Kansas City to its third straight league championship with a 17–2 record and a .381 batting average. In the playoffs against the St. Louis Stars he hit .450 and won three more games, including one shutout. However, before the World Series rematch with Hilldale, Rogan suffered a knee injury while playing with his young son. Forced to undergo surgery, he missed the series. Without their star, the Monarchs were defeated in six games.

The following season, Rogan took over from José Méndez as manager of the Kansas City Monarchs. In that season&#x27;s NNL playoffs against the Chicago American Giants, he pitched and lost both games of a series-deciding doubleheader to the younger Bill Foster. As late as 1928 at the age of 34, Bullet Rogan was the best hitter (.358) and arguably the best pitcher (10–2) on the Monarchs. That year he slammed three home runs in a game against the Detroit Stars.

Rogan continued at the Monarchs&#x27; helm in 1929 when they won their fourth NNL championship and recorded the best record (62–17) in the history of the league. On April 29, 1930, in Enid, Oklahoma, Rogan played for the Monarchs in baseball&#x27;s first night game. In August he was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness. He remained out of the lineup for more than a year, finally returning on September 28, 1931.

When Wilkinson did not organize a Kansas City Monarchs team for 1932, Rogan joined a white independent team in Jamestown, North Dakota, where he played until August. He batted .315 and went 20–3 as a pitcher before returning to the reorganized Monarchs in September. In the winter of 1933 and 1934, Rogan returned to Hawaii and the Philippines as a member of the Philadelphia Royal Giants, a black all-star team. The Royal Giants toured Japan and China as well. In 1936, at the age of 43, Rogan appeared in the East-West All-Star Game.

==Rogan as player and manager==
Relatively small (5 foot 7, 160 pounds (72.6 kg)), Rogan was solidly built and strong, with thin legs and a narrow waist but broad shoulders. He threw and batted right-handed, and used an unusually heavy bat. &quot;You saw Ernie Banks hit in his prime, then you saw Rogan&quot;, said Buck O&#x27;Neil. &quot;He could hit that ball...He was the type of guy that stood a long way from the plate. Not too close, because they&#x27;d jam you.&quot; According to his longtime teammate Frank Duncan, &quot;Rogan was one of the best low-ball hitters I ever saw, and one of the best curve-ball hitters. Rogan taught Bob and Irish Meusel how to hit curve balls.&quot; While not extremely fast, he ran the bases well and stole when necessary.

As a pitcher, Rogan used a no-windup delivery and both overhand and sidearm motions, and relied on an array of curveballs, a spitball, a palmball, a forkball, and the fastball that gave him his nickname. According to the sportswriter A.S. &quot;Doc&quot; Young, &quot;Joe Rogan possessed as much natural ability as Smokey Joe or Satch, but his control was not up to theirs.&quot; Frank Duncan, who caught both Paige and Rogan, said, 

Satchel was easier to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan was all over the plate—high, low, inside, outside. He&#x27;d walk five-six men, but he didn&#x27;t give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today&#x27;s best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best pitchers in the business.
Another Monarchs teammate, George Carr, said, 

Rogan was the greatest pitcher that ever threw a ball. He had not only an arm to pitch with but a head to think with. Rogan was a smart pitcher with a wonderful memory. Once Rogan pitched to a batter, he never forgot that batter&#x27;s weaknesses and strong points. And don&#x27;t think Rogan was nicknamed &quot;Bullet&quot; for nothing. That guy had a ball that was almost too fast to catch. He would really burn &#x27;em in there.
As a manager, he was a strict disciplinarian, possibly a result of his military background. Carroll &quot;Dink&quot; Mothell maintained that &quot;Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they did it in the army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different things. I could take it, but we had ball players, when he&#x27;d get on them, they&#x27;d go into a shell, resented it, and didn&#x27;t give him their best.&quot; Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that &quot;Rogan wasn&#x27;t the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself. He couldn&#x27;t teach pitchers much, because he&#x27;d say, &#x27;All you have to do is go out and throw the man what I threw&#x27;.&quot; According to historian Phil Dixon, &quot;In Rogan&#x27;s first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends.&quot; He did not trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan &quot;discarded his distant approach&quot; and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.

==Personal life==
On October 22, 1922, Wilber Rogan married Kathrine McWilliams, a Colorado farm girl. Their son Wilber Rogan, Jr., was born right after the 1924 World Series. Between the 1923 and 1924 seasons, it was reported that Rogan spent the winter writing life insurance. After his retirement as a player, Rogan became an umpire in the Negro American League until 1946, then worked in the post office. He died in Kansas City, Missouri on March 4, 1967, at age 73. The Baseball Hall of Fame first admitted Negro league players in the 1970s, but did not honor Rogan until 1998, 31 years after his death.

<text>Multi-source, as it applies to downloading data, or files from the internet, is a method of decreasing download time for large files by getting data from two or more sources.

== Overview ==

A program that can handle multi-source downloads will connect to one computer and begin downloading the desired file, then find another computer hosting the same file and begin downloading that file as well. The program controls downloads so that each source file provides separate data and the user does not download the same part of the file twice. The program then builds the file on the downloader&#x27;s computer much faster than it would if it had to wait for the entire file to be downloaded from a single source.

This works faster because the rate at which the file servers upload is finite and download rates are generally faster than upload rates. Therefore, downloading from a single server would create a bottleneck if the server&#x27;s upload rate does not equal your maximum download rate. So distributing the download across multiple servers allows you to utilize all of your download rate potential.

Many download managers use the principles of multi-source downloading.

==Examples of programs that use Multi-source downloading==
ApexDC++ is an example of a program that uses multi-source downloading. The program uses a DC (direct connect) protocol and downloads a large file by dividing it into smaller parts and downloading the smaller parts from different hosts.

<doc id="697694" wikidata="Q270573" url="?curid=697694" title="Elk River (British Columbia)">
<text>The Elk River is a long river, in the southeastern Kootenay district of the Canadian province of British Columbia. Its drainage basin is in area. Its mean discharge is approximately , with a maximum recorded discharge of . It is a tributary of the Kootenay River, and falls within the basin of the Columbia River.

==Course==
The Elk River originates from the Elk Lakes near the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains. It flows through the Elk Valley in a southwesterly direction, joining the Kootenay River in Lake Koocanusa, just north of the British Columbia-Montana border. Its waters ultimately join the Columbia River and flow towards the Pacific Ocean.

The Elk River runs through the communities of Elkford, Sparwood, Hosmer, Fernie, and Elko.

==History==
David Thompson travelled along the Elk River in 1811, and called it the Stag River. James Sinclair&#x27;s second settlement expedition to the Pacific Northwest from the Red River Colony made a difficult crossing from the Kananaskis River valley into the Columbia–Kootenays via the Elk in 1854. The river was labelled Elk River on John Palliser&#x27;s 1857–58 map and &quot;Stag or Elk River&quot; on Arrowsmith&#x27;s 1862 map.

===Elko Dam===

Elko Dam was built by East Kootenay Power Company on the Elk River in 1924. It is a run-of-the-river dam tall and long. The powerhouse has two Francis turbines producing 12MW of electricity. It is about upriver from the Elk&#x27;s confluence with Lake Koocanusa. It is operated by BC Hydro.

===Coal mining impacts===
The Elk River Valley is home to five large open-pit coal mines, supplying a third of the world&#x27;s steel-making coal. For many years increased selenium, phosphate and nitrate levels have been linked to the continued expansion of the mining. Selenium levels continue to exceed the guidelines for human health. The selenium pollution has heavily impacted the cutthroat trout in the river, which suffer from deformation of their gills.

Teck Resources, as the operator of the coal mines that are the source of the selenium pollution, is working to implement selenium management strategies. They operate the West Line Creek Active Water Treatment Plant. British Columbia provincial officials agreed to involve to International Joint Commission in 2024. While tribes in the U.S. and Canada have long desired this, BC officials have previously resisted commission involvement.

==Fishing==
The fishing in the Elk River is known to be some of the best fly-fishing in North America, with large, wild cutthroat and bull trout.

<text>Getting Along Famously is a Canadian sitcom which aired on CBC Television in 2006.

Set in the early 1960s, &quot;Getting Along Famously&quot; starred real-life couple Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath as the hosts of a television variety show. Supporting cast members included Robin Duke, Bob Martin, Paul O&#x27;Sullivan, Ed Sahely and Patrick McKenna.

The pilot episode, &quot;Saving Ruby&#x27;s Ass&quot;, aired January 10, 2005. It was one of three sitcom pilots aired by the CBC, along with &quot;Walter Ego&quot; and &quot;Hatching, Matching and Dispatching&quot;, as a viewer response poll. Pilots that polled favourably were developed into full series. The CBC previously employed this strategy with the shows &quot;Rideau Hall&quot; and &quot;An American in Canada&quot;.

The series was cancelled in June 2006 and released on DVD in October 2006.

<text>Richard F. Arenstorf (November 7, 1929 – September 18, 2014) was an American mathematician. He discovered a stable orbit between the Earth and the Moon, called an Arenstorf Orbit. It was the basis of the orbit used by the Apollo Program for going to the Moon.

Arenstorf received his Ph.D. from the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz in 1956.

==Arenstorf orbit==
At the time when the United States was attempting to go to the Moon, no solution was known for orbiting regularly around two objects, such as a spacecraft traveling between the Earth and the Moon. This is a special case of the three-body problem, for which a general analytical solution is not known. However, the case of an Earth-Moon satellite can be simplified to four interactions (from the usual 6), because although the three objects gravitationally pull on each other, the effect of the spacecraft&#x27;s gravity upon the motion of the vastly more massive Earth and Moon is negligible.

Arenstorf found a stable orbit for a spacecraft orbiting between the Earth and Moon, shaped like an &quot;8&quot; with the Earth or Moon located inside the loops of the &quot;8&quot;. For a permanent presence on the Moon, it would be the path of what Arenstorf calls a &quot;Space Bus&quot;, a ferry that could periodically transport supplies and people between the Earth and Moon without directly expending fuel. By staying on the Arenstorf orbit, lunar astronauts could efficiently return to Earth. Before leaving NASA after the first Moon landing, Arenstorf mapped out an emergency rescue orbit. This orbit was used in the Apollo 13 incident, in which a catastrophic malfunction aborted the Moon landing, but the astronauts ultimately returned to Earth without a major course adjustment.

=== Professor ===
After leaving NASA, Arenstorf became a professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University, where he specialized in celestial mechanics and analytic number theory. One of his specialties in number theory was the properties of the Riemann zeta function, which allows generalizations to be made about the nature of prime numbers.

==Recognition ==

Arenstorf&#x27;s portrait is found among Johannes Kepler&#x27;s and Isaac Newton&#x27;s in the &quot;Museum&quot; beginning the book &quot;Foundations of Mechanics&quot; by Ralph Abraham.

Arenstorf received the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal in 1966.

==Popular culture==

In the movie Apollo 13, a sketch of the Arenstorf orbit is drawn on a chalkboard and referred to throughout the movie to mark the progress and dangers of the imperiled astronauts.

== Death ==
He died of heart failure on September 18, 2014, in Nashville, Tennessee.

<doc id="697702" wikidata="Q901462" url="?curid=697702" title="Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award">
<text>The Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award is a lifetime honor presented annually by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) to a living writer of fantasy or science fiction. It was first awarded in 1975, to Robert Heinlein. In 2002, it was renamed after Damon Knight, the founder of SFWA, who had died that year.

The presentation is made at the annual SFWA Nebula Awards banquet, commonly during May, but it is not one of the Nebulas, which recognize the preceding calendar year&#x27;s works and are selected by vote of all Association members. SFWA officers and past presidents alone submit Grand Master nominations and the final selection must be approved by a majority of that group. The recipient is announced in advance, commonly during the preceding calendar year.

From 1995 to 2010, SFWA also gave some writers the title of Author Emeritus. In 2023, SFWA announced the creation of the Infinity Award, which posthumously honors creators who died before they could be considered for the Grand Master Award. The first recipient of the Infinity Award was Octavia E. Butler.

==History==
The first Grand Master, Robert Heinlein, was named in 1975. The Grand Master Award was originally limited to six recipients per decade; six were presented in the ten years to 1984 and twelve in the twenty years to 1994. From 1995, the award has been conferred annually, with the exception of 2002 and 2011. Andre Norton was the first woman to receive the award, in 1984. As of 2024, Nalo Hopkinson is the youngest person to have received the award; she was aged 59.

From 1995 to 2010, SFWA also awarded the title of Author Emeritus &quot;as a way to recognize and appreciate senior writers in the genres of science fiction and fantasy who have made significant contributions to our field but who are no longer active or whose excellent work may no longer be as widely known as it once was.&quot; Recipients were invited to speak at the annual Nebula Awards banquet. Fourteen honorees were named in the sixteen years the award was given. As of 2024, there has been no overlap between Grand Masters and Authors Emeritus. The award&#x27;s status as a consolation prize was a matter of controversy.

==Grand Masters==
As of 2024, 40 Grand Masters have been created. The list below shows the year of the award ceremonies for each respective recipient. Awards are announced in advance of the ceremony, sometimes in the preceding year.
==Infinity Award==

In 2023, SFWA announced the creation of the Infinity Award, which posthumously honors creators who died before they could be considered for the Grand Master Award. SFWA President Jeffe Kennedy said, &quot;Over the years, so many creators have been passed over for the Grand Master nod, for one reason or another. Some died tragically early. Others were not recognized for their work during their lifetimes because of cultural prejudices and blind spots.&quot;

==Anthologies==
In 1989, the anthology &quot;Grand Masters&#x27; Choice&quot; was published, edited by Andre Norton and Ingrid Zierhut. Three more anthologies honoring recipients of the Grand Master Award and collecting some of their short works have been published: &quot;The SFWA Grand Masters, Volume 1&quot; (1999), &quot;The SFWA Grand Masters, Volume 2&quot; (2000), and &quot;The SFWA Grand Masters, Volume 3&quot; (2001), all edited by Frederik Pohl. Collectively, they honor the first fifteen recipients of the award.

<text>Ho is the capital of the Ho Municipal Assembly and the Volta Region of Ghana. The city lies between Mount Adaklu and Mount Galenukui or Togo Atakora Range, and is home to the Volta Regional Museum, a cathedral, and a prison. The city is the capital of unrecognised Western Togoland. It was formerly the administrative capital of British Togoland now part of the Volta Region. The population of Ho Municipality according to the 2010 Population and Housing Census is 177,281 representing 8.4 percent of the region&#x27;s total population. Females constitute 52.7 percent and males represent 47.3 percent. The population in Ho grew up to 180,420 National Population Census. About 62 percent of the population resides in urban localities. The Municipality shares boundaries with Adaklu and Agotime-Ziope Districts to the South, Ho West District to the North and West and the Republic of Togo to the East (see Figure 1.1). Its total land area is 2,361 square kilometers (912 sq mi) thus representing 11.5 percent of the region&#x27;s total land area.

== History ==
Ho was a part of the German colony of Togoland until World War I, when it was occupied by the British. Ho later became the capital of the League of Nations mandate of British Togoland until that entity&#x27;s incorporation into the British Gold Coast colony, which subsequently became Ghana. The town was initially inhabited by the people of Hegbe (now Heve), followed by the people of Banakoe (now corrupted to Bankoe). These two groups lived alongside each other with individual chiefdoms. The first known chief of the Bankoe people was Afede Asor I, known in his private life as Akorli. The chief of Heve was Anikpi I, who was known in his private life as Amexo Doh (Adzah Doh). The Ahoe and Dome joined the settlement at a later stage but came to play leading roles in its development. The people of Dome(of Akan origin) became the ruling class until the emergence of modern-day chieftaincy which they ceded to the Bankoe people. The people of Hliha are a sub-group of Bankoe.

<text>The Chile national football team (), nicknamed La Roja (), represents Chile in men&#x27;s international football competitions and is controlled by the Federación de Fútbol de Chile which was established in 1895. Chile has appeared in nine World Cup tournaments and were hosts of the 1962 FIFA World Cup where they finished in third place, the highest position the country has ever achieved in the World Cup.

Chile won their first Copa América title on home soil at the 2015 Copa América, defeating Argentina in the final. They successfully defended their title in another final against Argentina won on penalties at Copa América Centenario the following year in the United States. Prior to this, Chile had been runners-up in the competition on four occasions. As a result of winning the 2015 Copa América, they qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, where they finished second, behind Germany, in their debut appearance.

==History==
The Federación de Fútbol de Chile is the second oldest South American federation, having been founded in Valparaíso on 19 June 1895. Chile was one of the four founding member nations of CONMEBOL. Together with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, the four competed in the first South American Championship, later to be renamed the Copa América, in 1916. On 12 October 1926, Chile made the first corner-kick goal in Copa América history in a match against Bolivia. Chile was one of the thirteen national teams that competed in the inaugural World Cup in 1930. The team started off well, beating Mexico and France without conceding a goal. A 3–1 loss to Argentina in the final game left the Chilean team in second place within the group, eliminating it from the tournament. In the 1950 World Cup, Chile defeated the United States, 5–2, but nevertheless was eliminated in the first round.

The best Chilean result in the World Cup was third place in 1962, as the host nation. Chile lost 4–2 to eventual champion Brazil in a semi-final but went on to defeat Yugoslavia 1–0 to earn third place. Chilean players made two World Cup firsts: the first player to miss a World Cup penalty kick was the Chilean Guillermo Subiabre, in a 1930 FIFA World Cup match against France, and Carlos Caszely of Chile became the first player to be sent off with a red card, during a match against West Germany at the 1974 World Cup.

A scandal known as &quot;El Maracanazo&quot; occurred on 3 September 1989. At a 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Maracanã stadium, Brazil led Chile 1–0 and &quot;La Roja&quot; needed to win. Chilean goalkeeper Roberto Rojas fell to the pitch with an apparent injury to his forehead. A firework had been thrown from the stands by a Brazilian fan named Rosenery Mello do Nascimento and was smouldering about a yard away. After Rojas was carried off the pitch, the Chilean players and coaches claimed that conditions were not safe and they refused to return, so the match was abandoned. However, video footage of the match showed that the firework had not made contact with Rojas. FIFA forfeited the game to Brazil, Chile was banned from the qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and Rojas was banned for life, although an amnesty was granted in 2001.

On 19 July 2007, the Chilean Football Federation banned six of the national team players, because of &quot;internal indiscipline&quot; during the Copa América tournament, for 20 international matches each as they destroyed the team hotel property while drunk. The players banned were captain Jorge Valdivia, defenders Álvaro Ormeño, Rodrigo Tello, Jorge Vargas, Pablo Contreras and striker Reinaldo Navia. Nelson Acosta&#x27;s resignation as manager came after Chile were knocked out of the 2007 Copa América. After serving 10 matches from the ban, all players aside from Ormeño sent a letter of apology acknowledging their actions which lifted the ban. Chile had qualified to the quarter-finals after a 3–2 win against Ecuador, and a 0–0 draw against Mexico. But two losses, one of those being a 6–1 defeat against Brazil, sealed Acosta&#x27;s fate. Former Argentina manager Marcelo Bielsa was given the task of becoming the Chile national team manager in preparation for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers.

On 16 October 2008, Chile beat Argentina 1–0 for the first time in a qualifying competition, making history. Marcelo Bielsa was acclaimed for this accomplishment by both Chilean and Argentinian people. This match was seen as one of the reasons that ended Alfio Basile&#x27;s tenure as the Argentina coach.

After finishing in second place of the CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa and reaching the round of 16 at the tournament, head coach Marcelo Bielsa extended his contract with the Chile national team until 2015.
Bielsa stated that he would leave his position if Jorge Segovia were elected as President of the Chilean Football Board. He followed through on this threat, despite Segovia&#x27;s election being annulled, and resigned in February 2011. Claudio Borghi then became Chile&#x27;s manager in March 2011.

After a string of bad performances and harsh criticisms, Claudio Borghi stepped down as Chile&#x27;s manager in November 2012. A new manager, Jorge Sampaoli, was appointed in December 2012. A disciple of Marcelo Bielsa, Jorge Sampaoli broke new records for La Roja by winning 10, drawing 3, and losing only 3 of 15 games as the head of the Chile national team.

With Sampaoli, Chile were able to qualify for 2014 FIFA World Cup, reaching to the round of 16, where Chile lost to host nation Brazil on penalties.

In the 2015 Copa América, Chile won their first game against Ecuador, with 2–0 being the score. In their second game, Chile drew against Mexico. Chile advanced to the knockout stage as Group A winners with 7 points and most goals scored of any team in the tournament (10). Then they beat Uruguay in the quarterfinals and Peru in the semi-finals. In the final, Chile defeated Argentina on penalties (4–1) after a 0–0 draw, to win their first Copa America title.

In January 2016, just six months after winning the 2015 Copa America, Jorge Sampaoli stepped down as Chile&#x27;s manager. A new manager, the Argentinean Juan Antonio Pizzi, was appointed at the end of the same month, who then led &quot;La Roja&quot; to a second Copa America Centenario 2016 victory after again beating Argentina in the final.

In the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, for which they had qualified by winning the Copa America, Chile won their first group stage match against Cameroon with 2–0 being the score. In their second match against the Germany, Chile drew 1-1 in a tense match. In their final game of the group stage against Australia, Chile drew once again but qualified to the knockout stage, being in second place with five points. In the semis, after a tense and exciting match, Chile came out on top, beating Portugal on Penalties, 3–0 and hence they qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup Final. In their first ever final in a FIFA-sanctioned tournament, Chile faced Germany and lost 1–0.

On 10 October 2017, after losing 3–0 to Brazil, Chile failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, causing an end to what was perceived as their &quot;golden generation&quot;. They ended up being the highest ranked team that failed to qualify at 9th, placing sixth in the round-robin after losing out on overall goal difference to Peru, the number of points being equal.

In the 2019 Copa America, Chile beat Colombia on penalties in the quarter-finals but then lost to Peru 3-0 in the semi finals. Chile also failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, finishing seventh in the standings with five wins, four draws, and nine losses.

==Team image==
The team&#x27;s home kit consists of a red jersey, blue shorts, and either red or white socks. The away jersey, meanwhile, features a white jersey, white shorts, and blue socks. The color scheme of red, white, and blue that was featured in the 1947 South American Championship, the precursor of the Copa América, has remained in place since. In 2016, red shorts were introduced as an option for the first time.

In August 2010, Puma acquired the contract to be the official kit supplier for the Chilean team from 2011 to 2015, paying US$ 3 million per year, also providing referees&#x27; kits and balls for domestic club competitions. The previous kit supplier, from 2004 to 2010 including the 2010 World Cup, was Brooks Sports.

Puma company ended its link after the 2015 Copa América with the tender for the new brand that will outfit the team since August 2015. This procedure was won by the American company Nike. The contract with Nike was supposed to last until the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but ended prematurely when the Chilean Football Federation sued Nike for missing payments in 2021. This dispute lead to Chile blocking the Nike patch with a flag during the 2021 Copa América. On 1 September 2021, Adidas were announced as the national team kit supplier until 2026.

==Home stadium==
The Chile national team plays their qualifying matches at the Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos located in Santiago, Chile and can be found at the commune of Ñuñoa. The construction of the stadium began in February 1937, and opened on 3 December 1938. The current official registered capacity is of 49,000 spectators, but has surpassed the 75,000 mark on many occasions when the match is of high demand. An example would be the 1962 FIFA World Cup semi-final match Chile vs. Brazil, where over 76,000 spectators viewed the game. The highest attendance ever was 85,262 on 26 December 1962, for a game between Universidad Católica and Universidad de Chile.

It has hosted four Copa América finals, the final of the 1962 FIFA World Cup and the final to the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship.

== Rivalries ==

Chile has no special rivalry, however, two matches are considered important: those against Argentina and Peru.

=== Argentina ===
With 96 games played, is the most played fixture in the history of the Chile national team and the third most played for Argentina after their encounters with Uruguay and Brazil. The teams&#x27; first meeting was in Buenos Aires on 27 May 1910, and matches always draw large crowds in Chile. Only 1 of the 6 victories on the 90 games played, was in an official competition, which occurred in 2010 World Cup qualification, until the 2015 and 2016 Copa America finals which were won by penalty shoot-outs.

=== Peru ===
The Chile–Peru football rivalry is known in Spanish as the &quot;Clásico del Pacífico&quot; (&quot;Pacific Derby&quot;). The rivalry is considered to be one of the fiercest rivalries in the world, with CNN World Sport editor Greg Duke ranking it among the top ten football rivalries in the world. The rivalry between Chile and Peru stems from historical politics, border disputes, and the War of the Pacific, with the rivalry producing some of the most intense matches in South American footballing history.

Chile first faced Peru in the 1935 South American Championship, losing 1–0.

=== Brazil ===
Although it is a dominating rivalry for Brazil, both teams have had matches in the last three Chilean World Cup appearances, all of them in the round of 16 knock out stage. France 1998, South Africa 2010, Brazil 2014. In the 2014 World Cup hosted by Brazil, the match was finished 1–1 after extra time, and in the last second of extra time Mauricio Pinilla&#x27;s shot hit the crossbar. Brazil then won 3–2 in the penalty shootout, with Brazilian keeper Júlio César (the same keeper in the 2010 match) saving two penalties and Pinilla again missing the target during his attempt. They also faced each other at the 1962 FIFA World Cup hosted by Chile; they met at the semi-finals, with Brazil prevailing, advancing to the championship game and eventually winning its second World Cup tournament.

Brazil also defeated Chile in decisive games for the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification, the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification and the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification; all three times resulted with the Chilean squad eventually not reaching the tournament proper. The defeat at the 1990 qualifiers occurred at the match known as the Chilean Maracanazo, when goalkeeper Roberto Rojas injured himself and pretended to be hit by a flare thrown from the stands of Maracanã stadium where the Brazilian supporters were located. When the ruse was discovered, the originally abandoned match was awarded as a victory for Brazil and Chile was eventually disqualified from the competition; the suspension lasted for the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers as well. Rojas was banned for life from the sport, although he eventually was pardoned in 2001.

<doc id="697716" wikidata="Q8041529" url="?curid=697716" title="X-Terminators">
<text>The X-Terminators is the name of several fictional groups of mutant characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first group was created by Louise Simonson and Jon Bogdanove, and they first appeared in &quot;X-Terminators&quot; (Vol. 1) #2 (November 1988). The second group was created by Leah Williams and Carlos Gómez, and first appeared in &quot;X-Terminators&quot; (Vol. 2) #1 (September 2022).

==Publication history==
The X-Terminators was initially the undercover name for the first incarnation of X-Factor, first using the name in &quot;X-Factor&quot; (Vol. 1) #8 (June 1986). 
The wards of these characters would then go on to take up the name, during the Inferno event, with a 4 issue tie-in miniseries and appearances in &quot;New Mutants&quot; Vol. 1 #72-74, and &quot;New Mutants&quot; Annual 7.
The group would reform under Cable in &quot;Cable: Reloaded&quot; (Vol. 1) #1.
The next group to take the name had a 5 issue limited series in the Destiny of X line of X-Men comics. They also 

==Fictional history==
The five original X-Men (Angel, Beast, Cyclops, Iceman, and Marvel Girl) had founded X-Factor, and posed as normal humans purported to be an organization of mutant-hunters. When they went into action in costume in public, they posed as another mutant team under the name X-Terminators. Eventually, X-Factor realized that this ruse was actually a ploy by their former business manager Cameron Hodge to worsen human-mutant relations, they abandoned the X-Terminators identity.

In their time posing as mutant-hunters, X-Factor secretly gathered together a number of mutants, including some Morlocks and several adolescents. The group consisted of Boom-Boom, Rusty Collins, Rictor, Skids, and two younger children, Leech and Artie Maddicks.

These young trainees were split between two boarding schools separated by about a mile. Artie and Leech were sent to a school for dyslexics. They enjoyed it there, especially after they convinced the teachers that they should be kept together. The older kids attended Phillips Exeter Academy (a real-life elite boarding school), and were tormented by the other students. Rusty himself, however, had gone to prison voluntarily, to answer for the accidental injuries he had caused with his flame powers.

When the events of &quot;Inferno&quot; began, goblins, sensing the powers in Artie and Leech, kidnapped them out of their beds at school. The demons were supposed to have gathered younger, more powerful children but were initially confused.

Taki, their new friend, fought the demons with his power to craft complex machinery from nearby objects. The demons knocked him out, escaping with the boys. Taki then formed a flying machine in order to gather the rest of the group. Initially, Rusty did not want to leave his prison cell, but agreed to do so when he understood the kids were in danger.

Artie, Leech, and Taki became prisoners of the demons for a while, with Taki forced to make complex machines that enhanced the powers of the demon leader N&#x27;astirh. The rest of the team joined up with the New Mutants. All the children kidnapped by the demons, including Artie, Leech, and Taki, were eventually rescued safely.

The younger kids were returned to school and, the older members joined forces with the New Mutants, effectively ending the team. In 2021, Cable recruited some of the old members in a mission to Breakworld in the Last Annihilation event. The team named itself the X-Terminators.

The title X-Terminators was revived in 2022 for a limited series in the Destiny of X line, featuring Jubilee, Dazzler, Boom-Boom, and Wolverine. They teamed up again when vampires were targeting Dazzler&#x27;s fans.

==Members==
In 1988, the team debuted in &quot;X-Terminators&quot; (Vol. 1) #1.



==In other media==
Boom-Boom, Rusty Collins, Skids, and Wiz Kid appeared in the X-Men: The Animated Series episode &quot;No Mutant Is An Island&quot;. There they are orphans whom Cyclops met while visiting his old orphanage in Nebraska. A man known as Killgrave offered to help and adopted the orphans, seemingly out of charity. In reality, Killgrave, a mutant himself (Killgrave acquired his powers via chemical accident and is not a mutant) with telepathic abilities, wanted to use their powers to take over as governor. Scott was able to snap Rusty and the others out of Killgrave&#x27;s hypnotic brainwashing in the end.

<text>Edmund Patrick Jordan, OBE (born 30 March 1948) is an Irish businessman, television personality and former motorsport team owner. Born in Dublin, Jordan worked first at the Bank of Ireland. He won the Irish Kart Championship in 1971 and moved to Formula Ford in 1974. He was the founder and owner of Jordan Grand Prix, a Formula One constructor which operated from 1991 to 2005. He was the chief analyst for Formula One coverage on the BBC from 2009 to 2015 before joining Channel 4 after BBC pulled out in 2016. He is the current co-owner of London Irish rugby club.

==Early life==
Jordan was born at the Wentworth Nursing Home in Dublin on 30 March 1948, the son of Eileen and Paddy Jordan. He has one, older, sibling Helen. His father was the twin brother of a senior nun, Mother Rectoress of the Irish Sisters of Charity and worked as an accountant for the electricity board. At ten months old, Jordan developed a form of pink disease and his family were advised by doctors to move from Dublin to Bray for &quot;fresh air&quot;. His mother Eileen was advised to &quot;take him out of woollens and into cotton during the month of May&quot;, advice she opposed, initially. Nevertheless, she conceded and Jordan&#x27;s condition did gradually improve. During his childhood, Jordan grew up in Dartry, south Dublin and Bray, County Wicklow. He spent most of his time in Bray, where he became close with his Aunt Lilian, having regularly travelled to visit her at the end of the school week. In his childhood, Jordan was known by the nickname &quot;Flash&quot; as his surname rhymed with the name Gordon.

Jordan began his education at Saint Anne&#x27;s Pre-School in Milltown later spending eleven years at the Synge Street Christian Brothers School, where he and his fellow students would be regularly beaten if they did not study hard. Despite this experience, Jordan found the level of education to be high. While at Synge Street, aged 15, Jordan briefly considered becoming a priest. Having dismissed the priesthood and family pressures to enter dentistry, he ended up taking a six-week accountancy course at the College of Commerce, Dublin, and then began working for the Bank of Ireland as a clerk at their branch in Mullingar. After four years, Jordan moved to the branch in Camden Street, Dublin. During a banking strike in Dublin in 1970, he spent the summer on the island of Jersey, working as an accountant for an electricity company by day and doing bar work in the evenings. During this period, he encountered kart racing for the first time, and had his first (unofficial) races there at St Brelade&#x27;s Bay.

==Career==

===Motor racing===
Upon his return to Dublin, Jordan bought a kart and began racing. He entered the Irish Kart Championship in 1971 and won it.

In 1974, Jordan moved up to Formula Ford, the Irish Formula Ford Championship and, in 1975, to Formula Three, but was forced to sit out the 1976 season after shattering his left leg in a crash at Mallory Park. After his injuries had healed, he switched to Formula Atlantic, won three races in 1977, and won the Irish Formula Atlantic Championship in 1978. Jordan and Stefan Johansson raced in British Formula Three in 1979, under the name &quot;Team Ireland&quot; and, in the same year, Jordan drove in one Formula Two race and did a small amount of testing for McLaren. He raced in the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans in a BMW M1 with Steve O&#x27;Rourke and David Hobbs.

===Team management===
At the end of 1979 and short of money, Jordan founded his first team, Eddie Jordan Racing, which ran drivers David Leslie and David Sears in 1981 at various events in and around Great Britain. In 1982 his primary driver was James Weaver; in 1983 Weaver ran again in European F3 and Jordan hired Martin Brundle, who finished second to Ayrton Senna in British F3. In 1987 the team employed Johnny Herbert, who proceeded to win the British Formula Three Championship.

Jordan also entered a Formula 3000 team, whose first wins came with drivers Herbert and Martin Donnelly in 1988. In 1989 the Jordan F3000 team dominated the season and Jordan driver Jean Alesi won the championship. During 1989, hired Reynard Chief Designer Gary Anderson becoming Donnelly&#x27;s engineer and overseeing operations of the team eventually joining full-time on 4 February 1990.

===Mentor===
A host of drivers owe their breaks to Jordan. Drivers who have won Grands Prix who have driven for him include world champions Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher, while Jean Alesi, Rubens Barichello, Thierry Boutsen, Giancarlo Fisichella, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, Johnny Herbert, Eddie Irvine, Roberto Moreno, Ralf Schumacher, Jarno Trulli, Martin Brundle and John Watson also drove in Jordan cars.

===Formula One===
Jordan founded Jordan Grand Prix in 1991 with Anderson as Chief Designer. The team quickly gained its respect and punched above their weight on a number of occasions during the season. Jordan gave Michael Schumacher his Formula 1 debut in the team&#x27;s debut season. After one race for the team, Schumacher was lured away to rivals Benetton.

In the team achieved its best ever result when drivers Damon Hill and Ralf Schumacher finished first and second at the Belgian Grand Prix. In , Jordan achieved their F1 zenith when Heinz-Harald Frentzen became a genuine contender for the championship, ultimately finishing third, the best placing ever of a Jordan driver and accumulating two race wins along the way. He was leading the European Grand Prix, but retired because of electrical problems. Had he won the race, Frentzen would have been within a point of the championship lead with two rounds remaining.

===Decline and sale===
After losing a Honda engine partnership deal to the BAR team in 2002 and numerous difficulties within the team (including a very public row and the sacking of Frentzen before his home GP in 2001), Jordan was forced to switch to expensive Cosworth engines. The added burden of this plus DHL withdrawing their sponsorship and Benson &amp; Hedges toning down their sponsorship soon added up and the lack of funds made his team go from bad to worse in 2003. However, despite this, Jordan delivered an improbable race win in Brazil 2003 courtesy of Giancarlo Fisichella, the first for Fisichella and the last Formula One victory for the Ford Motor Company and the Jordan team. In 2001 Jordan sued Vodafone for allegedly breaking a three-year sponsorship agreement worth $150 million but lost the case creating further setbacks for Team Jordan.

Jordan&#x27;s steep fall from third in the constructors in 1999 was now out of control. Despite new sponsorship from Trust computers and the addition of &quot;Quick&quot; Nick Heidfeld and a promising young rookie in Timo Glock for 2004, Jordan was in serious trouble. Jordan retained complete ownership of his team until 2004 and his rejections of rumoured approaches for buy outs (most notably from Peugeot and Honda) may have cost the team greater success. Jordan, however, said at the team&#x27;s final race that they in fact won five times—the fifth being their survival on such small funds.

===Team after Jordan===
Midland Group, financed by wealthy Russian-Canadian businessman Alex Shnaider, bought Jordan Grand Prix in early 2005, and the team was subsequently renamed MF1 Racing for . The team was sold again in 2006 to Dutch car manufacturer Spyker Cars to become Spyker F1 for , and then sold once more to become Force India in . After bankruptcy proceedings in 2018, Force India was liquidated and its former assets sold to the new Racing Point F1 Team, which became Aston Martin for the 2021 F1 season. Aston Martin competes in Formula One and operates out of Jordan&#x27;s old premises at Silverstone.

===Media career===
In 2009, Jordan returned to the F1 scene as a pundit for BBC Sport&#x27;s &quot;Grand Prix&quot; programme alongside Jake Humphrey (who was later replaced by Suzi Perry) and David Coulthard. Jordan was full time between 2009 and 2011 but did live races only from 2012 to 2015.

Jordan wrote a monthly column called &quot;This Much I Know&quot; for &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine, until they relaunched with Murray Walker writing instead. Jordan also worked on a TV series called &quot;Eddie Jordan&#x27;s Bad Boy Racers&quot;. In 2007 he was appointed Chairman of Rally Ireland, a round of the World Rally Championship.

Jordan has broken many stories before they were due to be confirmed; these include Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s move to Mercedes, Michael Schumacher&#x27;s return in 2010 and Felipe Massa&#x27;s departure from Ferrari.

On 11 February 2016 it was announced that he would be one of the new presenters for &quot;Top Gear&quot;. In March 2016 he was announced as Channel 4&#x27;s lead analyst for C4F1 .

In 2023 Jordan launched his own podcast called &#x27;Formula For Success&#x27;, alongside his ex-BBC co-presenter David Coulthard. The format for the show is typically where Coulthard and Jordan have a celebrity guest (F1, music, business, acting background).

In October 2024, Jordan was reported to be part of a consortium including ex-South Africa rugby player Bobby Skinstad and former New Zealand All Black Andrew Mehrtens looking to purchase former Premiership Rugby club London Irish. The consortium is backed by private equity group Strangford Capital. London Irish were looking for new ownership having been forced out of business as a result of an unpaid tax bill. The stated intention of the takeover was to emulate the success of the City Football Group for rugby with the consortium also in talks to purchase ProD2 club AS Béziers Hérault forming a network of interconnected clubs. In February 2025, the consortium completed the takeover of London Irish and stated their intention to return the club to either the Premiership or United Rugby Championship by 2026.

<text>The Columbia Plateau is an important geologic and geographic region that lies across parts of the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is a wide flood basalt plateau between the Cascade Range and the Rocky Mountains, cut through by the Columbia River.

== Geology ==

During late Miocene and early Pliocene times, a flood basalt engulfed about of the Pacific Northwest, forming a large igneous province. Over a period of perhaps 10 to 15 million years, lava flow after lava flow poured out, ultimately accumulating to a thickness of more than 6,000 feet (1.8  km). As the molten rock came to the surface, the Earth&#x27;s crust gradually sank into the space left by the rising lava. The Columbia River Basalt Group consists of seven formations: The Steens Basalt, Imnaha Basalt, Grande Ronde Basalt, Picture Gorge Basalt, Prineville Basalt, Wanapum Basalt, and Saddle Mountains Basalt. Many of these formations are subdivided into formal and informal members and flows.

The subsidence of the crust produced a large, slightly depressed lava plateau. The ancient Columbia River was forced into its present course by the northwesterly advancing lava. The lava, as it flowed over the area, first filled the stream valleys, forming dams that in turn caused impoundments or lakes. Entities found in these lake beds include fossil leaf impressions, petrified wood, fossil insects, and bones of vertebrate animals.

Evidence suggests that some concentrated heat source is melting rock beneath the Columbia Plateau Province at the base of the lithosphere (the layer of crust and upper mantle that forms Earth&#x27;s moving tectonic plates). In an effort to figure out why this area, far from a plate boundary, had such an enormous outpouring of lava, scientists established hardening dates for many of the individual lava flows. They found that the youngest volcanic rocks were clustered near the Yellowstone Plateau and that the farther west they went, the older the lavas.

Although scientists are still gathering evidence, a probable explanation is that a hot spot, an extremely hot plume of deep mantle material, is rising to the surface beneath the Columbia Plateau Province. Beneath Hawaii and Iceland, a temperature instability develops (for reasons not yet well understood) at the boundary between the core and mantle. The concentrated heat triggers a plume hundreds of kilometers in diameter that ascends directly through to the surface of the Earth.

The track of this hot spot starts in the west and sweeps up to Yellowstone National Park. The steaming fumaroles and explosive geysers are ample evidence of a concentration of heat beneath the surface. The hotspot is stationary, but the North American plate is moving over it, creating a superb record of the rate and direction of plate motion.

<text>A gadfly is a person who interferes with the &quot;status quo&quot; of a society or community by posing novel, potentially upsetting questions, usually directed at authorities. The term has a modern use but it was originally associated with the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, as portrayed in Plato&#x27;s Apology when Socrates was on trial for his life.

==History==
===Socrates===
The term &quot;gadfly&quot; (, &quot;mýops&quot;) was used by Plato in the &quot;Apology&quot; to describe Socrates&#x27; acting as an uncomfortable goad to the Athenian political scene, like a spur or biting fly arousing a sluggish horse.

During his defense when on trial for his life, Socrates, according to Plato&#x27;s account, pointed out that dissent, like the gadfly, was easy to swat, but the cost to society of silencing individuals who were irritating could be very high: &quot;If you kill a man like me, you will injure yourselves more than you will injure me&quot; because his role was comparable to that of a gadfly: &quot;to sting people and whip them into a fury, all in the service of truth&quot;.

Dominic Scott notes that in the &quot;Apology&quot;, the allusion speaks well of Socrates, whereas in the &quot;Meno&quot;, the image which compares Socrates to a stingray who &quot;numbs&quot; his interlocutors into silence and confusion has the opposite effect.

===Modern politics===
The image used by Socrates is applied in modern politics: a gadfly is someone who persistently challenges people in positions of power, the &quot;status quo&quot; or a popular position. For example, Morris Kline wrote, &quot;There is a function for the gadfly who poses questions that many specialists would like to overlook. Polemics is healthy.&quot;

<doc id="697734" wikidata="Q4673727" url="?curid=697734" title="Achilleis (trilogy)">
<text>The Achilleis (; Ancient Greek , &quot;Achillēís&quot;, ) is a lost trilogy by the Athenian dramatist Aeschylus. The three plays that make up the &quot;Achilleis&quot; exist today only in fragments, but aspects of their overall content can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty. Like the &quot;Oresteia&quot; which forms &quot;a narratively connected unit with a continuous plot,&quot; the trilogy had a unified focus, presumably treating the story of Achilles at Troy in a version comparable to the plot of the latter two-thirds of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In the Myrmidons (, &quot;Myrmidónes&quot;), Achilles&#x27; refusal to fight after his quarrel with Agamemnon led to the death of Patroclus. The title of the play traditionally placed second in the trilogy is the Nereids (, &quot;Nēreídes&quot;). The chorus was thus a group of Nereids, and the subject of the play involved Achilles and his Nereid mother Thetis, probably her mourning his imminent death and the acquisition of his new arms. In the Phrygians (, &quot;Phrýges&quot;) or &quot;Ransom of Hector&quot; (Ἕκτορος λύτρα, &quot;Héktoros lútra&quot;), Priam and a chorus of Phrygians sought to retrieve Hector&#x27;s body from the still wroth Achilles.

Neither the trilogy&#x27;s title &quot;Achilleis&quot; nor the grouping of the plays is explicitly attested from antiquity, but the existence of a unified trilogy with Achilles as its focus has long been accepted by modern scholars. In his commentary on &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot;, Garvie states that it is &quot;highly likely that Aeschylus often, though not always (of the surviving plays &quot;Persae&quot; is an almost certain exception) composed trilogies consisting of tragedies connected in their subject matter.&quot; In addition to the &quot;Oresteia&quot; (to which &#x27;The Libation Bearers&#x27; belongs), the &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; and &quot;Suppliants&quot; formed part of connected trilogies, as did the lost plays that make up the &quot;Lycurgeia&quot;.
The satyr plays that accompanied these examples had plots related to those of the tragedies, and it has been suggested that the &quot;Achilleis&quot; might also have been followed by a comedic play related to its dramatic content, but there is no evidence as to what the subject of this satyr play might have been.

Since the &quot;Achilleis&quot; survives in fragments, its text is comparatively more fluid than that of ancient texts with medieval manuscript traditions. During the first half of the 20th century papyrus fragments of numerous lost Aeschylean plays, including the &quot;Myrmidons&quot;, were discovered that added much material to, and greatly altered the modern conception of, the dramatist&#x27;s corpus. Given this fluidity, it is especially important to consult the most current critical edition or translations of the text, since earlier editions will likely not reflect the advances of the past century. In the case of the fragments of Aeschylus, the edition of record is the third volume of &quot;Tragicorum Graecorum fragmenta&quot; edited by Stefan Radt (1985). While it is now customary to refer to the text and numeration of Radt, the majority of the fragments of the &quot;Achilleis&quot; can also be found in Mette&#x27;s 1959 edition. For example, fr. 140 Radt and 232 Mette refer to the same three-word fragment of the &quot;Myrmidons&quot;, uttered (in Mette&#x27;s opinion) by Achilles: &quot;Arms! I want arms!&quot; (, &quot;hóplōn hóplōn deî&quot;). Sommerstein&#x27;s Loeb is the most current English translation and follows the numeration of Radt, as does this article. It is thought by some scholars to be the most impassioned piece of homoerotic literature produced by the ancient world.

==The trilogy==
Given Aeschylus&#x27; tendency to write connected trilogies, three plays attested in the catalogue of his work have been supposed to constitute the &quot;Achilleis&quot;: &quot;Myrmidons&quot;, &quot;Nereids&quot; and &quot;Phrygians&quot; (alternately titled &quot;The Ransoming of Hector&quot;). Despite the paucity of surviving text, the &quot;Myrmidons&quot; has achieved some measure of fame, because of Aristophanes&#x27; satire of it at &quot;Frogs&quot; 911–13 in which Euripides mocks Aeschylus&#x27; stagecraft:
: πρώτιστα μὲν γὰρ ἕνα τιν&#x27; ἂν καθῖσεν ἐγκαλύψας,
: Ἀχιλλέα τιν&#x27; ἢ Νιόβην, τὸ πρόσωπον οὐχὶ δεικνύς,
: πρόσχημα τῆς τραγῳδίας, γρύζοντας οὐδὲ τουτί.

: At the very beginning he sits someone alone, enshrouded,
: some Achilles or Niobe, not showing the mask,
: the ornament of tragedy, mumbling not even this much.
This play, along with the also lost &quot;Niobe&quot;, are two famous examples cited in antiquity of the often-discussed theme of the &quot;Aeschylean silence&quot;.

===&quot;Myrmidons&quot;===

&quot;Myrmidons&quot; (frr. 131–42 Radt; 211–35 Mette) concerned Achilles&#x27; refusal to fight for the Greeks, which tragically leads to the killing of his companion Patroclus by the Trojan hero, Hector; this death persuades Achilles to rejoin the fight.

===&quot;Nereids&quot;===

In &quot;Nereids&quot; (frr. 150–54 Radt; 236–41 Mette), Thetis and a chorus of sea-nymphs bring Achilles his new armor. The remainder of the action probably would have concerned his revenge killing of Hector and Patroclus&#x27; funeral.

===&quot;Phrygians&quot;===

The action of &quot;Phrygians&quot; (frr. 263–72 Radt; 242–59 Mette) almost certainly corresponded with Book 24 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;: Achilles&#x27; defilement of Hector&#x27;s corpse and his eventually agreeing to ransom the body back to the grieving father, Priam.

==The text==

A small number of verses from these three of Aeschylus&#x27; lost works have been saved: fifty-four from &quot;Myrmidons&quot;, seven from &quot;Nereids&quot; and twenty-one from &quot;Phrygians.&quot; A sense of the pace at which additions to this corpus are made can be gleaned from the fact that a papyrus fragment containing seven letters on three lines that could be fitted over a two-line quote from Justin Martyr&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Trypho&quot;, to show that the quote was in fact from the opening of &quot;Myrmidons&quot; was worth publishing in a note in &quot;Classical Philology&quot;, 1971.

==Modern adaptation==

The &quot;Achilleis&quot; and the circumstances of its transmission came to broader public notice in 2003 when ThoC, Cyprus&#x27; national theatre, announced that it would be staging an adaptation (by way of creative reconstruction) of the trilogy by Elias Malandris. Malandris&#x27; &quot;Achilleis&quot;, on which he had worked for more than a decade, built upon classicist Bruno Snell&#x27;s work on the fragments and filled out their content with material adapted from the &quot;Iliad&quot; and other ancient references to Achilles. On the process of staging a largely lost work of ancient tragedy, Andy Bargilly, then director of the Theatre, stated: &quot;We do think it is a faithful adaptation to a large extent, but nobody can say 100 percent.&quot; The reconstructed trilogy premiered July 7, 2004, with Mario Frangoulis as Achilles.

<text>Steve Wynn (born February 21, 1960) is an American singer, musician and songwriter. He led the band The Dream Syndicate from 1981 to 1989 in Los Angeles, afterward began a solo career, and then reformed The Dream Syndicate in 2012.

==Career==
===Growing up in Los Angeles===
Wynn was born February 21, 1960, at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California. He played in his first band The Light Bulbs at age 9 and followed with another band Sudden Death Overtime a year later while attending Emerson Junior High School. He later attended University High School (Los Angeles) with classmates Darby Crash and Pat Smear who would later go on to form the Germs. He left Los Angeles to attend the University of California, Davis in 1977.

===College Years in Davis, California===
Before forming The Dream Syndicate, Wynn played guitar in the Davis-based band Suspects, whose members included vocalist Kendra Smith (with whom he later founded The Dream Syndicate), and Russ Tolman and Gavin Blair (who would form True West). In 1979, Suspects released a single, &quot;Talking Loud&quot; b/w &quot;It&#x27;s Up to You&quot;, and the band remained active through 1981.

After Suspects disbanded, Wynn formed the trio 15 Minutes with two members of Alternate Learning, bass player Carolyn O&#x27;Rourke and drummer Eric Landers. With 15 Minutes, Wynn wrote and produced the 1981 single &quot;That&#x27;s What You Always Say,&quot; b/w &quot;Last Chance For You,&quot; which he engineered with Alternate Learning&#x27;s frontman, Scott Miller. The A-side, &quot;That&#x27;s What You Always Say,&quot; was later performed by the Dream Syndicate.

===The Dream Syndicate (1981–1989) (2012–present)===

The Dream Syndicate&#x27;s eponymous EP was released on Wynn&#x27;s own label, Down There Records. They were signed a few months later to Slash Records where they made &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, a record often cited as one of the cornerstones of both the Indie Rock and Americana (music) scenes that followed. In the spring of 1983, they toured the US with U2 for three weeks and then signed with A&amp;M Records. They recorded their second album &quot;Medicine Show&quot; with Sandy Pearlman and then toured the US for eight weeks with R.E.M. before embarking on their first European tour. Lineup changes followed along with the albums &quot;Out of the Grey&quot; and &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; and extensive touring before the band broke up in 1988.

Though they were popular with critics and had an influence on other musicians, the Dream Syndicate were not commercially successful. The band did establish the fan base on which Wynn built his solo career. The Dream Syndicate reformed in 2012 for a series of gigs in Europe and USA. They continued touring sporadically for the next few years and eventually went into the studio in 2017 to record their first album on new material since reforming. The album, &quot;How Did I Find Myself Here?&quot;, was released on September 8, 2017, on the Anti- label. In 2019 Dream Syndicate released their second album of original material since reforming, &quot;These Times&quot;. A more improvisational album, &quot;The Universe Inside&quot;, followed in 2020.

===Solo career and side projects===
Wynn broke up The Dream Syndicate in 1989 to redefine (or &quot;undefine&quot;) himself, and has since released a number of solo albums exploring various musical styles. His first solo album, &quot;Kerosene Man&quot; (on which Dream Syndicate bassist Mark Walton played also) included a duet with Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, backing work by bassist Fernando Saunders, drummer D. J. Bonebrake from the L.A. punk band X, Howe Gelb of Giant Sand and saxophonist Steve Berlin from Los Lobos. Peter Buck, from R.E.M., played on its follow-up, &quot;Dazzling Display,&quot; and co-wrote the title song. After 1994&#x27;s &quot;Fluorescent&quot;, he left Los Angeles for New York. Backing on &quot;Melting in the Dark&quot; (1996) was provided by the Boston band Come.

In 1997, Wynn recorded &quot;Sweetness and Light&quot; in Hoboken, New Jersey with Rich Gilbert, Armistead Wellford and Linda Pitmon. The record also marked the first collaboration with producer/engineer John Agnello.

&quot;Here Come the Miracles&quot; (2001) won the American Association of Independent Music award for Best Rock Alternative album in 2002. The record was the first of three albums, later known as the Desert Trilogy, that Wynn made in Tucson at Wavelab Studios with producer/engineer and studio owner Craig Schumacher. He toured behind these albums in the following years with his band the Miracle 3, consisting of Jason Victor, Dave DeCastro and Linda Pitmon, often augmented live and in the studio by Chris Cacavas (Green on Red, The Dream Syndicate) on keyboards. Dutch native and resident Erik Van Loo substituted for DeCastro on several tours and on the 2006 &quot;Live Tick&quot; album, recorded in Geislingen, Germany.

Wynn&#x27;s song &quot;Amphetamine&quot; from &quot;Static Transmission&quot; was re-recorded by the cast of the movie &quot;Bandslam&quot; and performed in its entirety in the film.

In 1985, Wynn wrote a collection of songs with Dan Stuart of Green on Red, and recorded and released them as Danny &amp; Dusty, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot;. The two reunited in 2007 for a second album, &quot;Cast Iron Soul&quot;, followed by two tours of Europe.

In the 1990s, he was a part of the indie supergroup Gutterball along with Stephen McCarthy of The Long Ryders, Bob Rupe of The Silos and Cracker, and Bryan Harvey and Johnny Hott of House of Freaks. The band recorded and released three albums and toured Europe extensively between 1993 and 1995.

The double CD &quot;From a Man of Mysteries: A Steve Wynn Tribute&quot; was released by the German label Blue Rose in 2004 and features Wynn&#x27;s songs performed by the likes of Concrete Blonde, the Silos, Chuck Prophet, The Minus 5, Russ Tolman of True West and others.

In 2007, Wynn formed The Baseball Project with Scott McCaughey, Peter Buck and Linda Pitmon. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Volume 1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails&quot; came out the following April with their first live performance coming on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The band has gone on to make four albums about the national pastime, later adding R.E.M.&#x27;s Mike Mills to the lineup.

The album &quot;Crossing Dragon Bridge&quot;, recorded in Ljubljana, Slovenia and produced by Chris Eckman of The Walkabouts, also came out in 2008 and was called &quot;Wynn&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; by Thom Jurek of AllMusic.

Wynn was hired by Norwegian film and TV director Øystein Karlsen to write the score and provide the soundtrack for the fourth and final season of the hit series &quot;Dag&quot; and then hired him again for the first season of &quot;Exit&quot;, which was the highest streamed show in Norwegian history.

In 2020, Real Gone Music released &quot;Decade&quot;, an 11-CD box set containing all of the official albums Wynn released during his first 10 years of living in New York City, along with 57 previously unreleased tracks of home demos and rarities.

<doc id="697747" wikidata="Q1398793" url="?curid=697747" title="The Rape of Lucrece">
<text>The Rape of Lucrece (1594) is a narrative poem by William Shakespeare about the legendary Roman noblewoman Lucretia. In his previous narrative poem, &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (1593), Shakespeare had included a dedicatory letter to his patron, the Earl of Southampton, in which he promised to compose a &quot;graver labour&quot;. Accordingly, &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; has a serious tone throughout.

The poem begins with a prose dedication addressed directly to the Earl of Southampton, which begins, &quot;The love I dedicate to your Lordship is without end.&quot; It refers to the poem as a pamphlet, which describes the form of its original publication of 1594.

The dedication is followed by &quot;The Argument&quot;, a prose paragraph that summarizes the historical context of the poem, which begins &quot;in medias res&quot;.

The poem contains 1,855 lines, divided into 265 stanzas of seven lines each. The meter of each line is iambic pentameter. The rhyme scheme for each stanza is ABABBCC, a format known as &quot;rhyme royal&quot;, which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer before Shakespeare and by John Milton and John Masefield after him.

==Setting==
The poem is set just before the establishment of the Roman Republic in 509 BC. The poem&#x27;s locations are Rome, Ardea, twenty-four miles south of Rome, and Collatium, ten miles east of Rome.

==Characters==
* LucreceAn honorable woman
* CollatineLucrece&#x27;s husband, an officer in the Roman army 
* Tarquin (Sextus Tarquinius)Son of king Lucius Tarquinius and an officer in the Roman army, who rapes Lucrece
* LucretiusLucrece&#x27;s father
* Junius BrutusFriend to Collatine and Lucretius
* A Messenger
* Lucius Tarquinius (Tarquin the Proud)King of Rome and Tarquin&#x27;s father
* Servius TulliusFather-in-law of Lucius Tarquinius
* Publius ValeriusFriend of Collatine and Lucretius

==Synopsis==
One evening, in the town of Ardea, where a battle is being fought, two leading Roman soldiers, Tarquin and Collatine, are talking. Collatine describes his wife, Lucrece, in glowing terms—she is beautiful and chaste. The following morning, Tarquin travels to Collatine&#x27;s home. Lucrece welcomes him. Tarquin entertains her with stories of her husband&#x27;s deeds on the battlefield.

Tarquin spends the night at Collatine&#x27;s house, and is torn by his desire for Lucrece. His desire overcomes him, and he goes to Lucrece&#x27;s chamber, where she is asleep. He reaches out and touches her breast, which wakes her up. She is afraid. He tells her that she must give in to him, or else he will kill her. He also threatens to cause her dishonor by murdering a slave and placing the two bodies in each other&#x27;s arms, and then he would claim that he killed her because he discovered them in this embrace. If she would give in to him, Tarquin promises to keep it all secret. Lucrece pleads with him to no avail. He rapes her.

Full of shame and guilt, Tarquin sneaks away. Lucrece is devastated, furious and suicidal. She writes a letter to her husband, asking him to come home. When Collatine gets home, Lucrece tells him the whole story, but doesn&#x27;t say who did it. Collatine demands to know. Before she tells him, Lucrece gets the soldiers, who are also there, to promise to avenge this crime. She then tells her husband who did it, and she immediately pulls out a knife, stabs herself and dies. Collatine&#x27;s grief is so great that he wants to kill himself, as well. His friend, Brutus, suggests that revenge is a better choice. The soldiers carry Lucrece&#x27;s body through the streets of Rome. The citizens, angered, banish Tarquin and his family bringing Republic rule back to Rome. 

==Publication and title==

&quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 9 May 1594, and published later that year, in a quarto printed by Richard Field for the bookseller John Harrison (&quot;the Elder&quot;); Harrison sold the book from his shop at the sign of the White Greyhound in St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard. The title given on the title page was simply &quot;Lucrece&quot;, though the running title throughout the volume, as well as the heading at the beginning of the text is &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s copyright was transferred to Roger Jackson in 1614; Jackson issued a sixth edition (O5) in 1616. Other octavo editions followed in 1624, 1632 and 1655. The poem went through eight editions before 1641.

==Historical background==
&quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; draws on the story described in both Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; and Livy&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot;. Both authors were writing a few centuries after the events occurred, and their histories are not accepted as strictly accurate, partly because Roman records were destroyed by the Gauls in 390 BC, and the histories prior to that have been mixed with legends.

The Roman king was Lucius Tarquinius, or Tarquin. Because of his arrogance and his tyranny, he is also known as &quot;Tarquinius Superbus&quot; (Tarquin the Proud). Lucius Tarquinius had killed his brother-in-law and father to become king of Rome. His son, Sextus Tarquinius, heir to the throne, is the rapist of the story. At the beginning of the poem the Roman army is waging war on a tribe known as the Volscians, who had claimed territory south of Rome. The Romans are laying siege to Ardea, a Volscian city 20 miles south of Rome.

In 509 BC, Sextus Tarquinius, son of the king of Rome, raped Lucretia (Lucrece), wife of Collatinus, one of the king&#x27;s aristocratic retainers. As a result, Lucrece committed suicide. Her body was paraded in the Roman Forum by the king&#x27;s nephew. This incited a full-scale revolt against the Tarquins led by Lucius Junius Brutus, the banishment of the royal family, and the founding of the Roman Republic.

==Allusions to Lucretia in other works by Shakespeare==

===&quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;===
&quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; is also closely related to the early Roman tragedy &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; (). In this revenge play, when the raped and mutilated Lavinia reveals the identity of her rapists, her uncle Marcus invokes the story of Lucrece to urge an oath to revenge the crime: &quot;And swear with me—as, with the woeful fere / And father of that chaste dishonoured dame, / Lord Junius Brutus swore for Lucrece&#x27; rape— / That we will prosecute by good advice / Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths, / And see their blood, or die with this reproach&quot; (4.1.89–94).

===&quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;===
In &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; Act 2, Scene 1, Petruchio promises Baptista, the father of Katherine (the Shrew), that once he marries Katherine &quot;for patience she will prove second Grisel, / And Roman Lucrece for her chastity&quot; (2.1.292–293).

===&quot;Twelfth Night&quot;===
In &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Maria&#x27;s letter in Olivia&#x27;s handwriting designed to gull Malvolio reads: &quot;I may command where I adore; but silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore: M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.&quot; As Malvolio interprets the &quot;fustian riddle&quot;, Olivia&#x27;s inability or unwillingness to speak of her love for him is killing her, like the literal knife of Lucretia&#x27;s suicide. Malvolio also notes that Olivia uses an image of Lucrece as a personal seal, and it is this that convinces him the letter is from Olivia.

===&quot;Macbeth&quot;===
The rapist Tarquin is also mentioned in Macbeth&#x27;s soliloquy from Act 2 Scene 1 of &quot;Macbeth&quot;: &quot;wither&#x27;d Murther ... With Tarquin&#x27;s ravishing strides, towards his design / Moves like a ghost&quot; (2.1.52–56). Tarquin&#x27;s actions and cunning are compared with Macbeth&#x27;s indecision—both rape and regicide are unforgivable crimes.

===&quot;Cymbeline&quot;===
Shakespeare retains the essence of the classic story, incorporating Livy&#x27;s account that Tarquin&#x27;s lust for Lucrece sprang from her husband&#x27;s own praise of her. Shakespeare later used the same idea in the late romance &quot;Cymbeline&quot; (). In this play, Iachimo bets Posthumus (Imogen&#x27;s husband) that he can make Imogen commit adultery with him. He does not succeed. However, Iachimo convinces Posthumus otherwise using information about Imogen&#x27;s bedchamber and body. Iachimo hid in a trunk which was delivered to Imogen&#x27;s chamber under the pretence of safekeeping some jewels, a gift for her father, King Cymbeline. The scene in which he emerges from the trunk (2.2) mimics the scene in &quot;The Rape of Lucrece.&quot; Iachimo compares himself to Tarquin in the scene: &quot;Our Tarquin thus, / Did softly press the rushes ere he waken&#x27;d / The chastity he wounded&quot; (2.2.12–14).

== Analysis and criticism ==
&quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;, one of Shakespeare&#x27;s earliest works, was published one year after &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;. It is seen as a tragic narrative poem, that is extremely rich in poetic images, fancies, and metaphors. It tells a moralistic tale of a bad deed, what caused it, how it occurred, and the tragic result.

In a post-structuralist analysis of the poem, Joel Fineman argues that &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;, like Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, deconstructs the traditional poetics of praise. Fineman observes that the tragic events of the poem are set in motion precisely by Collatine&#x27;s hyperbolic praise of Lucrece; it is his &quot;boast of Lucrece&#x27; sov&#x27;reignty&quot; (29) that kindles Tarquin&#x27;s profane desire. It is not the fact of Lucrece&#x27;s chastity, but rather the fact that her husband praises her with the &quot;name of &#x27;chaste&#x27;&quot; that inspires Tarquin&#x27;s crime: &quot;Haply, that name of &#x27;chaste&#x27; unhapp&#x27;ly set / This bateless edge on his keen appetite&quot; (8–9). Collatine&#x27;s praise paradoxically creates the circumstances that will ruin both the woman that he praises and the integrity of the rhetoric of praise itself. Furthermore, the poem itself draws attention to its own complicity in Collatine&#x27;s fatal rhetoric of praise: &quot;the poem itself performs or activates this same praising word of which it speaks&quot; by citing, in the first line of the second stanza, its own use of &quot;chaste&quot; in the last line of the first stanza: &quot;Collatine&#x27;s fair love, Lucrece the chaste&quot; (7). To Fineman, the poem&#x27;s initial self-citation is just one example of how the &quot;poem&#x27;s own rhetoricity is... performatively implicated in the rape it reports&quot;. In other words, the opening of the poem highlights an intrinsic link between the language of poetic praise and sexual violence. In these same opening stanzas, &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; also acknowledges how its own poetic rhetoric is part of this larger literary tradition which yokes praise and violence.

Jane Newman&#x27;s feminist analysis of the poem focuses on its relationship to the myth of Philomel and Procne from Book VI of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Ovid. In Newman&#x27;s reading, the tradition of violent female revenge for rape represented by the myth of Philomel is repressed in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. Shakespeare&#x27;s poem faintly alludes to Ovid&#x27;s myth, but does not present Procne and Philomel&#x27;s method of revenge as an authentic option for Lucrece. Although Lucrece maintains the ability to speak after the rape (in contrast to the mutilated Philomel who loses all speech), Newman argues that the poem actually limits Lucrece&#x27;s ability to act precisely by celebrating her self-sacrifice: &quot;The apparent contrast of a silent Philomela, robbed of the potential for such an impact on the political moment to which she belongs, effectively casts Lucretia&#x27;s suicide as the only form of political intervention available to women.&quot; Ironically, Lucrece&#x27;s rhetorical eloquence blocks the possibility that she herself could seek out a more active, violent retribution on Tarquin, her rapist, and the monarchical regime that he represents. Instead, her revenge must be carried out by male agents acting in her name, particularly Brutus, the founder of the Roman Republic, who imitates Lucrece&#x27;s self-sacrificing rhetoric as he leads the rebellion against Tarquin&#x27;s father, the king of Rome.

<text>Anthony John Spilotro (May 19, 1938 – June 14, 1986), nicknamed &quot;Tony the Ant&quot;, was an American mobster and high-ranking member of the Chicago Outfit who operated in Las Vegas during the 1970s and &#x27;80s. Spilotro managed the Outfit&#x27;s illegal casino profits (the &quot;skim&quot;) when four of the casinos, the Stardust, the Fremont, the Hacienda and the Marina, were managed by Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal, replacing Outfit member John Roselli. He was also the leader of the &quot;Hole in the Wall Gang&quot;, a burglary crew he formed when he moved to Las Vegas in 1971.

Spilotro eventually ran afoul of his superiors in Chicago over his handling of their Las Vegas concerns, and they arranged his murder on June 14, 1986. Spilotro&#x27;s criminal career was detailed in Nicholas Pileggi&#x27;s true crime book &quot;Casino&quot;, and served as the basis for the character Nicky Santoro in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s adaptation of that book by the same name in 1995.

==Early life==
Anthony Spilotro was born on May 19, 1938, in Chicago, Illinois, the fourth of six children to Pasquale &quot;Patsy&quot; Spilotro Sr. and Antoinette Spilotro. He attended Burbank Elementary School in his childhood and entered Steinmetz High School in 1953. Spilotro&#x27;s father had emigrated from Triggiano, Province of Bari, Italy, and had arrived at Ellis Island in 1914. Both parents ran Patsy&#x27;s Restaurant, which was frequented by mobsters such as Sam Giancana, Jackie &quot;The Lackey&quot; Cerone, Gus Alex and Francesco &quot;Frank the Enforcer&quot; Nitti.

Spilotro and four of his brothers (John, Vincent, Victor and Michael) became involved in criminal activity starting at an early age; after the deaths of Spilotro and Michael, Victor would be inducted into the Chicago Outfit a year later in 1987. The remaining brother, &quot;Patrick&quot; Pasquale Jr., became a dentist. Spilotro started his criminal career alongside his boyhood friend Frank Cullotta, engaging in theft, burglary and murder.

Spilotro was nicknamed &quot;Tony the Ant&quot; by the media after FBI Special Agent William Roemer publicly referred to him as &quot;that little pissant.&quot; Since the media could not use &quot;pissant&quot;, they changed it to &quot;the Ant&quot;.

==The Hole in the Wall Gang==
In 1971, Spilotro moved to Las Vegas to help oversee the local concerns of the Chicago Outfit, which controlled four casinos on the Las Vegas Strip: the Stardust, the Fremont, the Hacienda and the Marina. Bored with his new assignment, Spilotro formed a burglary crew later dubbed the &quot;Hole in the Wall Gang.&quot; The crew got its name from its penchant for drilling through the exterior walls and ceilings of the locations they burglarized. In early 1979, Cullotta moved to Las Vegas to join Spilotro.

On July 4, 1981, the Hole in the Wall Gang robbed Bertha&#x27;s Gifts &amp; Home Furnishings on East Sahara Avenue. The robbery was a bust as much of the gang was arrested, including Cullotta, Joe Blasko, Leo Guardino, Ernest Davino, Lawrence Neumann and Wayne Matecki—each charged with burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, attempted grand larceny and possession of burglary tools. Around this time, Spilotro had an affair with Geri McGee, the wife of Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal, whose casinos Spilotro had been sent to oversee.

In 1982, Cullotta was imprisoned and approached by the FBI with a wiretap of Spilotro talking with someone about &quot;having to clean our dirty laundry&quot;, which Cullotta took as an insinuated contract on his life. Due to this, in July 1982, Cullotta finalized an agreement with the prosecutors. In September 1983, Spilotro was indicted for conspiracy and obstruction of justice in the Sherwin &quot;Jerry&quot; Lisner murder and released on $100,000 bail. 

At a trial in October 1983, Cullotta admitted that he was involved in over 300 crimes, including four murders, perjury, robberies, and burglaries. He also testified that Spilotro, his boss in Las Vegas, ordered him to make a telephone call that lured one of the 1962 murder victims, William McCarthy, to a fast food restaurant. McCarthy and James Miraglia were found dead in the trunk of a car on May 14, 1962. McCarthy&#x27;s head had been placed in a vise and his throat slashed, while Miraglia was strangled. Spilotro was acquitted later that year. Spilotro&#x27;s defense attorney was future Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman.

==Death and aftermath==
Spilotro and his brother Michael disappeared on June 14, 1986, after they drove away together from Michael&#x27;s Oak Park home. Michael&#x27;s wife, Anne, reported both brothers missing on June 16. Michael&#x27;s car, a 1986 Lincoln, was recovered several days later in a motel parking lot near O&#x27;Hare International Airport. On June 22, their bodies were found, one on top of the other and stripped down to their undershorts, buried in a cornfield in the Willow Slough preserve near Enos, Indiana. The freshly turned earth had been noticed by a farmer who thought that the remains of a deer killed out of season had been buried there by a poacher and notified authorities. 

An autopsy completed on June 24 identified their cause of death as blunt force trauma, and ascertained that they had been dead since June 14. They were identified by dental charts supplied by their dentist brother, Patrick Spilotro. The two were buried in a family plot at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois, on June 27.

The Spilotro brothers&#x27; fate had been sealed in January 1986. In the wake of the imprisonment of Joseph Aiuppa and John Cerone for skimming Las Vegas casino profits, a meeting was held that month at the Czech Lodge in North Riverside, Illinois. Most of the &#x27;upper echelon&#x27; were there, including Outfit boss Tony &quot;Joe Batters&quot; Accardo. Accardo decided to appoint Samuel Carlisi as the &quot;Street Boss&quot; in charge of Outfit operations to replace Aiuppa. Carlisi told the group that Accardo would stay on as &quot;consigliere&quot; and would have the final say, as well as Gus Alex staying head of the connection guys. He then went on to the first problem: Spilotro, and how things had gone down since he took over Vegas. Mobster and mob enforcer Rocco Infelice said, &quot;Hit him.&quot; Everyone else at the meeting agreed. After his murder, Spilotro was replaced in Las Vegas by Donald &quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot; Angelini.

Although the original reports stated the Spilotros were beaten and buried in the Enos, Indiana cornfield, mobster Nicholas Calabrese testified at the &quot;Operation Family Secrets&quot; in 2007 that the brothers were killed in a Bensenville, Illinois, basement, where the Spilotros believed Michael would be inducted into The Outfit, then their bodies were transported to the cornfield. According to court testimony, when Tony entered the basement and realized what was about to occur, he asked if he could &quot;say a prayer&quot;.

No arrests were made until April 25, 2005, when 14 members of the Chicago Outfit (including reputed boss James Marcello) were indicted for 18 murders, including the Spilotros&#x27;. The suspected murderers included &quot;capo&quot; Albert Tocco from Chicago Heights, Illinois, who was sentenced to 200 years in prison in 1990, after his wife testified against him. She testified that, in 1986, she drove her husband from an Indiana cornfield where he told her he had just buried Spilotro.

On May 18, 2007, the star witness in the government&#x27;s case against the 14 Chicago mob figures, Nicholas Calabrese, pleaded guilty to taking part in a conspiracy that included 18 murders. Under heavy security, Calabrese admitted that he took part in planning or carrying out 14 of the murders including the Spilotro killings. He became the key witness against his brother, Frank Calabrese Sr., and other major mob figures charged in the government&#x27;s Family Secrets Trial. Calabrese agreed to testify after the FBI showed him DNA evidence linking him to the murder of fellow hit-man John Fecarotta who was also allegedly involved in the Spilotro slayings.

In September 2007 Frank Calabrese Sr. and four other men—Marcello, Joseph Lombardo, Paul &quot;The Indian&quot; Schiro, and former Chicago police officer Anthony &quot;Twan&quot; Doyle—were convicted of mob-related crimes. On September 27, 2007, Marcello was found guilty by a federal jury in the murders of both Spilotro brothers. On February 5, 2009, Marcello was sentenced to life imprisonment for the Spilotro murders, and United States District Judge James Zagel, agreeing with the presentation made by federal prosecutor Markus Funk, also found Marcello responsible for the D&#x27;Andrea murder as well even though the jury had deadlocked on that count. On March 26, 2009, Nicholas Calabrese was sentenced to 12 years and four months imprisonment.

In a 2010 interview with &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine, while promoting the opening of the Las Vegas Mob Experience at the Tropicana Hotel, Tony Spilotro&#x27;s son Vincent claimed that the real target of those who killed the Spilotro brothers was Michael Spilotro, and that Tony was killed to prevent any revenge.

==Suspect in gangland slayings==
By the time of his death in 1986, the FBI suspected Spilotro was involved in 22 or 25 murders, including those of:

* Sam DeStefano on April 14, 1973.
* former Chicago Outfit boss Sam Giancana on June 19, 1975.
* William McCarthy and James Miraglia.
* William &quot;Action&quot; Jackson.

==In popular culture==
In the 1980s NBC series &quot;Crime Story&quot;, the character of mobster Ray Luca is based on Anthony Spilotro. Show creator Michael Mann said in a 2015 interview &quot;“The people who Crime Story is about are all people I knew. I went to high school with Tony Spilotro...&quot;

Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;Casino&quot; (1995) is based on the Las Vegas careers of Spilotro and Rosenthal, on whom the characters Nicholas &quot;Nicky&quot; Santoro (played by Joe Pesci) and Sam &quot;Ace&quot; Rothstein (played by Robert De Niro) were based. Nearing the end of the film, Nicky and his brother Dominick (Philip Suriano), based on Tony&#x27;s brother Michael Spilotro, are shown being beaten with metal baseball bats (Nicky&#x27;s skull being fractured in the process) and then buried alive in an Indiana cornfield by their associate Frank Marino (Frank Vincent), based on Frank Cullotta, and the rest of Nicky&#x27;s crew.

<text>A rain of animals is a rare meteorological phenomenon in which flightless animals fall from the sky. Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history, an example being Lluvia de peces, a phenomenon that has occurred many times in Honduras. One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs and carry them for up to several miles. However, this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists.

== History ==
Rain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history. In the first century AD, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented storms of frogs and fish. In 1794, French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain, near the French city of Lille. Rural inhabitants in Yoro, Honduras claim &quot;fish rain&quot; happens there every summer, a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces, although the name may be indoctrination from a Spanish missionary as the fish have only been found near tributaries after storms.

== Explanations ==
French physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836) was among the first scientists to take accounts of raining animals. Addressing the Society of Natural Science, Ampère suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances.

After a reported rain of fish in Singapore in 1861, French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau speculated that a migration of walking catfish had taken place, dragging themselves over land from one puddle to another, following the rain.

The likeliest explanation for many of the supposed cases is that there is no falling happening at all and the animals are driven along by winds or a deluge of some sort. This explanation accounts for the prevalence of reports that just a single species or type of animal raining from the sky. In several occurrences within two weeks of October, 1987, three towns of Gloucestershire, England named, Stroud, Cirencester, and Cheltenham reported, by various people, about a heavy rain fall that also brought down dozens of tiny pink frogs. Some suggested strong winds, waterspouts, or tornados carried the frogs&#x27; eggs flying north across Africa, until falling on England.

A current scientific hypothesis involves tornadic waterspouts: a tornado that forms over the water. Under this hypothesis, a tornadic waterspout transports animals to relatively high altitudes, carrying them over large distances. This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains: small and light, usually aquatic, and by the suggestion that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm. However, the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species, and not a group of similarly sized animals from a single area. Further, the theory also does not account for a genuine tornadic waterspout not actually sucking objects up and carrying them rather than flinging objects out to the sides.

In the case of birds, storms may overcome a flock in flight, especially in times of migration. The Doppler image to the right shows an example wherein a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm. In the image, the bats are in the red zone, which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station, and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado (in green). These events may occur easily with birds, which can get killed in flight, or stunned and then fall (unlike flightless creatures, which first have to be lifted into the air by an outside force). Sometimes this happens in large groups, for instance, the blackbirds falling from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas, United States, on December 31, 2010. It is common for birds to become disoriented (for example, because of bad weather or fireworks) and collide with objects such as trees or buildings, killing them or stunning them into falling to their death. The number of blackbirds killed in Beebe is not spectacular considering the size of their congregations, which can be in the millions. The event in Beebe, however, captured the imagination and led to more reports in the media of birds falling from the sky across the globe, such as in Sweden and Italy, though many scientists claim such mass deaths are common occurrences but usually go unnoticed. In contrast, it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals.

Some cases are thought to be caused by birds dropping fish. With regard to a documented rain of fish that occurred on December 29, 2021 in Texarkana, Texas. Several residents of a landlocked city, in east Texas have reported a rare sight seeing fish all over the ground after they apparently fell from the sky during a rainstorm. Independent researchers, Sharon A. Hill and Paul Cropper, proposed that the fish had been dropped or possibly regurgitated by passing birds. The theory found some favor with airport workers who had cleaned up the fish; they noted that there were birds in the area around the same time, and the fish &quot;were kind of chewed up&quot;. In June 2022 around the San Francisco coast, a boom of anchovies is likely to be the cause of fair weather falling of fish from birds&#x27; mouths, such as pelicans.

<text>De Surinaamsche Bank (DSB; &quot;Bank of Suriname&quot; in English) is the largest bank in Suriname. It provides retail banking products such as transaction accounts, loans, mortgagees and credit and debit cards as well as business loans.

==History==
Simon Abendanon founded De Surinaamsche Bank (DSB) on 19 January 1865, in Paramaribo, and it opened for business on 18 July 1865, in the home of one of the founders, pending construction of its own building. The Bank’s headquarters remained in Amsterdam though. Abendanon was a captain and court bailiff in Suriname. After the abolition of slavery in 1863, there was a period of monetary chaos and Abendanon saw an opportunity in creating a bank that would issue bank-notes and use the funds to finance trade. After its founding in 1826, the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij issued banknotes. And then between 1828–1848, the West-Indische Bank issued banknotes for the Dutch West Indies.

The next organizational landmark occurred in 1948, when Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij acquired DSB. Three years later, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, which owned all the shares of DSB, transferred DSB’s headquarters to Paramaribo. In 1957, DSB formally gave up its right to issue notes to the newly formed Central Bank of Suriname.

In 1964, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij merged with De Twentsche Bank to form Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN), and the ownership of DSB transferred to the new bank. However, in 1977, the government of the Surinam Republic nostrified DSB. The government took 10% of the shares and required that the bank sell 41% to the public. ABN retained a minority position of 49%.

In 2001, ABN AMRO sold its 49% holding in DSB to Assuria N.V. Assuria already owned 5.6% of DSB so the purchase gave it majority control. In 2006, the bank became involved in a scandal because the director and his predecessor were accused of illegal financial transactions. 

In 2016, the bank suffered a major loss, partly due to irresponsibly large loans to the Surinamese government. In November 2017, the Central Bank of Suriname warned of a bank run on De Surinaamsche Bank. A week earlier, the CBvS called on fellow banks to deposit money in an emergency fund to keep the DSB afloat. This was followed by more alarming publications about the financial situation at the bank in the press. DSB customers err on the side of caution and withdraw their money from the bank.

<doc id="697793" wikidata="Q904824" url="?curid=697793" title="Thrust-to-weight ratio">
<text>Thrust-to-weight ratio is a dimensionless ratio of thrust to weight of a rocket, jet engine, propeller engine, or a vehicle propelled by such an engine that is an indicator of the performance of the engine or vehicle.

The instantaneous thrust-to-weight ratio of a vehicle varies continually during operation due to progressive consumption of fuel or propellant and in some cases a gravity gradient. The thrust-to-weight ratio based on initial thrust and weight is often published and used as a figure of merit for quantitative comparison of a vehicle&#x27;s initial performance.

==Calculation==
The thrust-to-weight ratio is calculated by dividing the thrust (in SI units – in newtons) by the weight (in newtons) of the engine or vehicle. The weight (N) is calculated by multiplying the mass in kilograms (kg) by the acceleration due to gravity (m/s). The thrust can also be measured in pound-force (lbf), provided the weight is measured in pounds (lb). Division using these two values still gives the numerically correct (dimensionless) thrust-to-weight ratio. For valid comparison of the initial thrust-to-weight ratio of two or more engines or vehicles, thrust must be measured under controlled conditions.

Because an aircraft&#x27;s weight can vary considerably, depending on factors such as munition load, fuel load, cargo weight, or even the weight of the pilot, the thrust-to-weight ratio is also variable and even changes during flight operations. There are several standards for determining the weight of an aircraft used to calculate the thrust-to-weight ratio range.

* Empty weight - The weight of the aircraft minus fuel, munitions, cargo, and crew.
* Combat weight - Primarily for determining the performance capabilities of fighter aircraft, it is the weight of the aircraft with full munitions and missiles, half fuel, and no drop tanks or bombs.
* Max takeoff weight - The weight of the aircraft when fully loaded with the maximum fuel and cargo that it can safely takeoff with.

==Aircraft==
The thrust-to-weight ratio and lift-to-drag ratio are the two most important parameters in determining the performance of an aircraft.

The thrust-to-weight ratio varies continually during a flight. Thrust varies with throttle setting, airspeed, altitude, air temperature, etc. Weight varies with fuel burn and payload changes. For aircraft, the quoted thrust-to-weight ratio is often the maximum static thrust at sea level divided by the maximum takeoff weight. Aircraft with thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1:1 can pitch straight up and maintain airspeed until performance decreases at higher altitude.

A plane can take off even if the thrust is less than its weight as, unlike a rocket, the lifting force is produced by lift from the wings, not directly by thrust from the engine. As long as the aircraft can produce enough thrust to travel at a horizontal speed above its stall speed, the wings will produce enough lift to counter the weight of the aircraft.

:formula_1

===Propeller-driven aircraft===
For propeller-driven aircraft, the thrust-to-weight ratio can be calculated as follows in imperial units:
:formula_2
where formula_3 is propulsive efficiency (typically 0.65 for wooden propellers, 0.75 metal fixed pitch and up to 0.85 for constant-speed propellers), hp is the engine&#x27;s shaft horsepower, and formula_4is true airspeed in feet per second, weight is in lbs.

The metric formula is:
:formula_5

==Rockets==
The thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket, or rocket-propelled vehicle, is an indicator of its acceleration expressed in multiples of gravitational acceleration &quot;g&quot;.

Rockets and rocket-propelled vehicles operate in a wide range of gravitational environments, including the &quot;weightless&quot; environment. The thrust-to-weight ratio is usually calculated from initial gross weight at sea level on earth and is sometimes called &quot;thrust-to-Earth-weight ratio&quot;. The thrust-to-Earth-weight ratio of a rocket or rocket-propelled vehicle is an indicator of its acceleration expressed in multiples of earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration, &quot;g&quot;.

The thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket improves as the propellant is burned. With constant thrust, the maximum ratio (maximum acceleration of the vehicle) is achieved just before the propellant is fully consumed. Each rocket has a characteristic thrust-to-weight curve, or acceleration curve, not just a scalar quantity.

The thrust-to-weight ratio of an engine is greater than that of the complete launch vehicle, but is nonetheless useful because it determines the maximum acceleration that &quot;any&quot; vehicle using that engine could theoretically achieve with minimum propellant and structure attached.

For a takeoff from the surface of the earth using thrust and no aerodynamic lift, the thrust-to-weight ratio for the whole vehicle must be greater than &quot;one&quot;. In general, the thrust-to-weight ratio is numerically equal to the &quot;g-force&quot; that the vehicle can generate. Take-off can occur when the vehicle&#x27;s &quot;g-force&quot; exceeds local gravity (expressed as a multiple of &quot;g&quot;).

The thrust-to-weight ratio of rockets typically greatly exceeds that of airbreathing jet engines because the comparatively far greater density of rocket fuel eliminates the need for much engineering materials to pressurize it.

Many factors affect thrust-to-weight ratio. The instantaneous value typically varies over the duration of flight with the variations in thrust due to speed and altitude, together with changes in weight due to the amount of remaining propellant, and payload mass. Factors with the greatest effect include freestream air temperature, pressure, density, and composition. Depending on the engine or vehicle under consideration, the actual performance will often be affected by buoyancy and local gravitational field strength.

<text>The genus Aptenodytes contains two extant species of penguins collectively known as &quot;the great penguins&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Aptenodytes&quot; is a composite of Ancient Greek elements, &quot;ἀ-πτηνο-δύτης&quot; (without-wings-diver).

==Taxonomy==

* King penguin, &quot;Aptenodytes patagonicus&quot;
**&quot;Aptenodytes patagonicus patagonicus&quot;
**&quot;Aptenodytes patagonicus halli&quot;
* Emperor penguin, &quot;Aptenodytes forsteri&quot;
*Ridgen&#x27;s penguin (&quot;Aptenodytes ridgeni&quot;), an extinct species known from fossil bones of Early or Late Pliocene age.

Combined morphological and molecular data have shown the genus &quot;Aptenodytes&quot; to be basal to all other living penguins, that is, the genus split off from a branch which led to all other species. DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago. This had been foreshadowed by an attempt to classify penguins by their behavior, which also predicted the genus&#x27; basal nature.
==Species==
Two species are extant:

<doc id="697796" wikidata="Q230126" url="?curid=697796" title="Dorothy Malone">
<text>Dorothy Malone (born Mary Dorothy Maloney; January 29, 1924 – January 19, 2018) was an American actress. Her film career began in 1943, and in her early years, she played small roles, mainly in B-movies, with the exception of a supporting role in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946). After a decade, she changed her image, particularly after her role in &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Her career reached its peak by the beginning of the 1960s, and she achieved later success with her television role as Constance MacKenzie on &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1964–1968). Less active in her later years, Malone&#x27;s last screen appearance was in &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; in 1992.

==Early life==
Malone was born Mary Dorothy Maloney on January 29, 1924 in Chicago, one of five children born to Esther Emma &quot;Eloise&quot; Smith and her husband Robert Ignatius Maloney, an auditor for AT&amp;T company.

When she was six months old, her family moved to Dallas, Texas. There she modeled for Neiman Marcus and attended Ursuline Academy of Dallas, Highland Park High School, Hockaday Junior College, and later, Southern Methodist University (SMU). She originally considered becoming a nurse. While performing in a play at SMU, she was spotted by a talent scout, Eddie Rubin, who had been looking to find and cast a male actor.
Malone recalled in 1981,

==Career==
===RKO – as Dorothy Maloney===
Malone was signed by RKO at age 18 as Dorothy Maloney. She made her film debut in &quot;Gildersleeve on Broadway&quot; (1943). She was credited as Dorothy Maloney in &quot;The Falcon and the Co-eds&quot; (1943), released shortly thereafter. She later recalled, &quot;I was a bridesmaid at a wedding in one picture. In another film, I was the leader of an all-girl orchestra. The only thing I did at RKO of any note was lose my Texas accent.&quot; Her RKO appearances included &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; (1943) with Frank Sinatra, &quot;Seven Days Ashore&quot; (1944), &quot;Show Business&quot; (1944) with Eddie Cantor, &quot;Step Lively&quot; (1944) again with Sinatra, and &quot;Youth Runs Wild&quot; (1944) for producer Val Lewton. RKO elected not to renew her contract. She made a brief uncredited appearance in &quot;One Mysterious Night&quot; (1944), a Boston Blackie film for Columbia.

===Warner Bros. – as Dorothy Malone===

She then signed a contract with Warner Bros. The studio, she said in 1985, changed her surname &quot;from Maloney to Malone. They placed my picture in the newspaper and they gave me a raise.&quot;

Malone&#x27;s early Warner movies included &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944), &quot;Too Young to Know&quot; (1945), and &quot;Frontier Days&quot; (1945). She first achieved notice when Howard Hawks cast her as the bespectacled bookstore clerk in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946) with Humphrey Bogart. Warner gave her bigger parts in &quot;Janie Gets Married&quot; (1945), &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1946), and &quot;To the Victor&quot; (1946), with Dennis Morgan. Her first lead was &quot;Two Guys from Texas&quot; (1948) with Morgan and Jack Carson; this film, in her words, established her onscreen persona as &quot;the all-American girl watching the all-American boy do all sorts of things.&quot;

She appeared in &quot;One Sunday Afternoon&quot; (1948) with Dennis Morgan and Janis Paige for director Raoul Walsh; this was a remake of &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot; (1941), with Malone playing the part played by Olivia de Havilland in the original. She was billed third in &quot;Flaxy Martin&quot; (1949) with Virginia Mayo and Zachary Scott, then played a good girl in a Western with Joel McCrea, &quot;South of St Louis&quot; (1949). McCrea and she were re-teamed in &quot;Colorado Territory&quot; (1949), a remake of &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), also for Walsh, her last film before she left the studio.

===Freelancer===
Columbia used Malone to play Randolph Scott&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;The Man from Nevada&quot; (1950). She stayed at that studio for &quot;Convicted&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Killer That Stalked New York&quot; (1950). She made &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Malley and Mr. Malone&quot; (1951) at MGM and played Tim Holt&#x27;s love interest in RKO&#x27;s &quot;Saddle Legion&quot; (1951) and John Ireland&#x27;s love interest in &quot;The Bushwackers&quot; (1951). She began acting on television while continuing to appear in films, guest-starring on shows such as &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot; (&quot;Education of a Fullback&quot;, 1951), and &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Golden Slate&quot;, 1951).

She relocated to New York City for several months to study acting until producer Hal B. Wallis called her back to appear in &quot;Scared Stiff&quot; (1953) starring the comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Malone appeared in a war film, &quot;Torpedo Alley&quot; (1952) for Allied Artists. She was a love interest in Westerns with Ronald Reagan (&quot;Law and Order&quot;, 1953) and Mark Stevens (&quot;Jack Slade&quot;, 1953). She was also in the thriller &quot;Loophole&quot; (1954), billed second. She did episodes of &quot;The Doctor&quot; (&quot;The Runaways&quot;, 1953), &quot;Omnibus&quot; (&quot;The Horn Blows at Midnight&quot;, 1953); &quot;Four Star Theatre&quot; (&quot;Moorings&quot;, 1953; &quot;A Study in Panic&quot;, 1954), &quot;Fireside Theatre&quot; (&quot;Afraid to Live&quot;, 1954; &quot;Our Son&quot;, 1954; &quot;Mr Onion&quot; 1955), &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Hunted&quot;, 1955), &quot;The Christophers&quot; (&quot;The World Starts with Jimmy&quot;, 1955), and &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Clown&quot; with Henry Fonda, 1955).

Film roles included &quot;The Lone Gun&quot; (1954), a Western with George Montgomery; &quot;Pushover&quot; (1954), a thriller with Fred MacMurray and Kim Novak; and &quot;Private Hell 36&quot; (1954) from director Don Siegel. Malone was reunited with Sinatra in &quot;Young at Heart&quot; (1954), as a co-star. She had a leading part in &quot;Battle Cry&quot; (1955), playing a married woman who has an affair with a young soldier (Tab Hunter) during World War II, a box-office hit.
She again co-starred with Ireland in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (1955), directed by Ireland but perhaps best remembered for being the first film produced by Roger Corman, who would later recount that Malone &quot;had left her agent and, having no work, accepted a part for next to nothing.&quot; He cast her as the female lead in his directorial debut, &quot;Five Guns West&quot; (1955). At Warner Bros., Malone made a Western with Randolph Scott, &quot;Tall Man Riding&quot; (1955), then was cast as Liberace&#x27;s love interest in the unsuccessful film &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot; (1955). More successful was the Paramount musical comedy &quot;Artists and Models&quot; (1955), a reunion with Martin and Lewis, where she played the love interest of Martin&#x27;s character. She then returned to Westerns: &quot;At Gunpoint&quot; (1955), with MacMurray; &quot;Tension at Table Rock&quot; (1956), with Richard Egan; and &quot;Pillars of the Sky&quot; (1956) with Jeff Chandler.

===&quot;Written on the Wind&quot; and stardom===

Malone transformed herself into a platinum blonde and shed her &quot;good girl&quot; image when she co-starred with Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, and Robert Stack in director Douglas Sirk&#x27;s drama &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; (1956). Her portrayal of the dipso-nymphomaniac daughter of a Texas oil baron won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

As a result, she was offered more substantial roles in such films as &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot; (1957), a biopic of Lon Chaney with James Cagney and &quot;Tip on a Dead Jockey&quot; (1957) with Robert Taylor. &quot;Quantez&quot; (1957) was another &quot;girl in a Western&quot; part, supporting Fred MacMurray, but &quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot; (1957) reunited her successfully with Hudson, Sirk, Stack, and producer Albert Zugsmith. Malone was given the important role of Diana Barrymore in the biopic &quot;Too Much, Too Soon&quot; (1958), but the film was not a success. Malone appeared in &quot;Warlock&quot; (1959), but went back to guest starring on such television programs as &quot;Cimarron City&quot; (&quot;A Respectable Girl&quot;, 1958) and &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Last Flight Out&quot;, 1960). Malone made a third film with Stack, &quot;The Last Voyage&quot; (1960), and a third with Hudson, &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; (1961).

However, she was working more and more in television: &quot;Route 66&quot; (&quot;Fly Away Home&quot;, 1961), &quot;Checkmate&quot; (&quot;The Heat of Passion&quot;, 1961), &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (&quot;The Watch&quot;, 1961), &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot; (&quot;Open Season&quot;, 1961), &quot;Dr Kildare&quot; (&quot;The Administrator&quot;, 1962), &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot; (&quot;Little White Lie&quot;, 1961, &quot;Somebody Please Help Me&quot;, 1962), &quot;The Untouchables&quot; with Stack (&quot;The Floyd Gibbons Story&quot;, 1962), and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (&quot;Where the Wire Ends&quot;, 1963). Malone was in the first &quot;Beach Party&quot; (1963) movie, doing most of her scenes with Robert Cummings. She made an uncredited cameo appearance in &quot;Fate Is the Hunter&quot; (1964).

===&quot;Peyton Place&quot;===

From 1964–1968, she played the lead role of Constance MacKenzie on the ABC primetime serial &quot;Peyton Place&quot; except for a brief stretch where she was absent due to surgery. Lola Albright filled in until her return. Malone agreed for $3,000 a week less than ABC&#x27;s offer of $10,000 weekly, if she could be home nightly for 6 pm dinner with her two daughters and no shooting on weekends. &quot;I never turned down a mother role&quot;, said Malone. &quot;I like playing mothers. I started out as a very young girl in Hollywood doing Westerns, portraying a mother with a couple of kids.&quot;

In 1968, she was written out of the show after complaining that she was given little to do. Malone sued 20th Century Fox for $1.6 million for breach of contract; it was settled out of court. She later returned to the role in the TV movies &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot; (1977) and &quot;Peyton Place: The Next Generation&quot; (1985).

===Later career===
After leaving &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, Malone went to Italy to make a thriller &quot;The Insatiables&quot; (1969). In Hollywood, she made a TV movie with Sammy Davis Jr., &quot;The Pigeon&quot; (1969), then returned to guest-starring on TV series such as &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot; (&quot;Is This Operation Necessary?&quot;, 1972), &quot;Ironside&quot; (&quot;Confessions: From a Lady of the Night&quot;, 1973), and &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; (&quot;The Adventure of the Eccentric Engineer&quot; 1975).

Malone had a supporting part in &quot;Abduction&quot; (1975). She featured in the miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1976) and guest-starred on &quot;Police Woman&quot; (&quot;The Trick Book&quot;, 1976) and &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; (&quot;Child of Anger&quot;, 1977). She was in the TV movie &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot; (1977) and had a supporting role in &quot;Golden Rendezvous&quot; (1977).

She was seen on television in &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; (&quot;The House on Possessed Hill&quot; 1978), &quot;Flying High&quot; (&quot;A Hairy Yak Plays Musical Chairs Eagerly&quot; 1978), &quot;Vega$&quot; (&quot;Love, Laugh and Die&quot; 1978), and the TV movie &quot;&quot; (1978).

Malone was in the Canadian soap opera &quot;High Hopes&quot; (1978) and had supporting parts in &quot;Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff&quot; (1979), &quot;Winter Kills&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Day Time Ended&quot; (1980), and the miniseries &quot;Condominium&quot; (1980).

In 1981, Malone made her stage debut in &quot;Butterflies Are Free&quot; in Winnipeg. She was suffering financial troubles at the time due to two expensive divorces and a life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

The producers of &quot;Dallas&quot; approached her to step into the role of Miss Ellie Ewing when Barbara Bel Geddes vacated the part in 1984 due to illness, but Malone declined. Her later appearances included &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot; (&quot;Guardian Angel&quot; 1982), &quot;Matt Houston&quot; (&quot;Shark Bait&quot; 1983), &quot;The Being&quot; (1983), &quot;Peyton Place: The Next Generation&quot; (1985), and &quot;Rest in Pieces&quot; (1987).

In her last screen appearance, she played a mother convicted of murdering her family in &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992).

==Personal life==
Malone was a Democrat and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Malone, a Roman Catholic, wed actor Jacques Bergerac on June 28, 1959, at a Catholic church in Hong Kong, where she was on location for her 1960 film &quot;The Last Voyage&quot;. They had two daughters, Mimi (born 1960) and Diane (born 1962) and divorced on December 8, 1964.

Malone then married New York businessman and broker Robert Tomarkin on April 3, 1969, at the Silver Bells Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her second marriage was later annulled after Malone claimed that Tomarkin married her because of her money.

Malone married Dallas motel chain executive Charles Huston Bell on October 2, 1971, and they divorced after three years.

Around 1971, Malone moved her daughters from Southern California to suburban Dallas, Texas, where she had been raised.

==Death==
Malone died of natural causes on January 19, 2018, 10 days before her 94th birthday, at a nursing facility in Dallas. She is entombed at Calvary Hill Cemetery and Mausoleum in Dallas.

==Recognition==
Malone has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1718 Vine in the Motion Pictures section. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.
Malone was one of the industry deaths missing from the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment at the 90th Academy Awards, an omission made more prominent by the fact that she had won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress at the 29th Academy Awards.

<text>The genus Pygoscelis (&quot;rump-legged&quot;) contains three living species of penguins collectively known as &quot;brush-tailed penguins&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago, about 2 million years after the ancestors of the genus &quot;Aptenodytes&quot;. In turn, the Adelie penguins split off from the other members of the genus around 19 million years ago.

;Extant species




A 2020 study found that the gentoo penguin may actually comprise a species complex of 4 similar but genetically distinct species: the northern gentoo penguin (&quot;P. papua&quot;), the southern gentoo penguin (&quot;P. ellsworthi&quot;), the eastern gentoo penguin (&quot;P. taeniata&quot;), and the newly-described South Georgia gentoo penguin (&quot;P. poncetii&quot;). However, in 2021 the International Ornithological Congress recognized these as being subspecies of &quot;P. papua&quot;.

A study has estimated that there are about 3.79 million pairs of Adélie, 387,000 pairs of gentoo, and 8 million pairs of chinstrap penguins in their particular areas, making up 90% of Antarctic avian biomass.
;Fossil species
* &quot;Pygoscelis grandis&quot; (Bahía Inglesa Formation, Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Bahía Inglesa, Chile)
* &quot;Pygoscelis calderensis&quot; (Bahía Inglesa Formation, Late Miocene of Bahía Inglesa, Chile)
* &quot;Pygoscelis tyreei&quot; (Pliocene of New Zealand)

The latter two are tentatively assigned to this genus.

<doc id="697806" wikidata="Q442481" url="?curid=697806" title="Kathleen Scott">
<text>Edith Agnes Kathleen Young, Baroness Kennet, FRBS (née Bruce; formerly Scott; 27 March 1878 – 25 July 1947) was a British sculptor. Trained in London and Paris, Scott was a prolific sculptor, notably of portrait heads and busts and also of several larger public monuments. These included a number of war memorials plus statues of her first husband, the Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott. Although the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; describes her as &quot;the most significant and prolific British women sculptor before Barbara Hepworth&quot;, her traditional style of sculpture and her hostility to the abstract work of, for example Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, has led to a lack of recognition for her artistic achievements. 

Kathleen Scott was the mother of Sir Peter Scott, the painter and naturalist and of the writer and politician Wayland Young from her second marriage to Edward Hilton Young. She is the grandmother of the sculptor Emily Young and of the writer Louisa Young.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born at Carlton in Lindrick, Nottinghamshire, Kathleen Scott was the youngest of the eleven children of the Church of England clergyman Lloyd Stuart Bruce (1829–1886) and his first wife Jane Skene (c. 1828–1880), an amateur artist. An orphan by the age of eight, Scott was brought up by a relative, William Forbes Skene, in Edinburgh where she attended St George&#x27;s School before being sent to boarding schools in England including a convent school run by nuns.

===Paris and Macedonia===
Scott studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London from 1900 to 1902. Then, with two friends from the Slade, Jessie Gavin and Eileen Gray, Scott enrolled at the Académie Colarossi in Paris. Although she had taken some modelling classes at the Slade, at the Académie Colarossi Scott concentrated on sculpture and within three months had a statuette of a mother and child accepted for the Paris Salon, where it won a medal. She was befriended by Auguste Rodin who, although he was not formally taking students at the time, agreed to mentor her and for Scott to visit his studio on a regular basis. In Paris, Scott also met Aleister Crowley, who wrote several poems about her, Gertrude Stein, Edward Steichen, Isadora Duncan and, very briefly, Pablo Picasso. Scott and Duncan became friends and in 1903 travelled to Belgium and the Netherlands together.

In December 1903, following the Ilinden uprising Scott joined a relief mission to Macedonia, undertaking logistic duties and some basic nursing work at refugee camps. There, in February 1904, Scott fell ill with a life-threatening bout of influenza and, possibly, typhoid. When she recovered she decided to return to Paris and boarded a freighter for Marseille but, finding herself to be the only women on the ship, disembarked at Naples and spent some months in Florence before returning to Paris and reopening her studio. Scott spent the summer of 1906 at Noordwijk in the Netherlands supporting a pregnant Isadora Duncan and then spent some months on an island near Methana in Greece before moving to London.

===Marriage to Robert Falcon Scott===
In London, Scott took a flat in Cheyne Walk and made a series of portrait busts, mostly of young men. She became acquainted with George Bernard Shaw, Max Beerbohm and J. M. Barrie, whose former home she later bought. At one point she became seriously ill with an abdominal cyst and was thought unlikely to live. Scott recovered and subsequently assisted her upstairs neighbour, a district maternity nurse, on house calls to deliver babies.

In October 1907 she met Captain Robert Falcon Scott at a tea party having briefly seen him at a lunch hosted by Mabel Beardsley several months earlier. The two spent ten days together before he left London on Naval duties but within a month they had decided to marry. Their wedding was on 2 September 1908, in the Chapel Royal at Hampton Court Palace with Rodin among the 150 guests. The couple took a house on Buckingham Palace Road in London and in September 1909 their son Peter Scott, who became famous in painting and conservation, was born. 
In July 1910, she accompanied her husband to New Zealand to see him off on his journey to the South Pole and in October that year they spent a fortnight together at Lyttelton, on the South Island, before Captain Scott and his crew departed on 29 November. Kathleen Scott returned to England and, after extended stop-overs in Australia and Egypt, arrived at Dover in February 1911. It has been suggested that, in her husband&#x27;s absence, she had a brief affair with the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen. This has been denied by others. 

In London Kathleen Scott created portrait busts and heads of various friends and relatives and also worked on a statuette of Florence Nightingale while supporting fund-raising exercises for the Antarctic expedition. She received her first commission for a public monument, a life-size statue of Charles Rolls, which was unveiled in April 1912. When Rolls&#x27;s family lent Scott some of his clothing for her model, she was shocked to find they had included blood-stained items from his fatal air crash. During 1912 she also created portrait busts of, among others, the Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, Fridtjof Nansen, Compton Mackenzie plus a series of figures of bishops for the chapel at Winchester College and a sculpture of a baby for a hospital. At the end of the year she began working on a statuette of her husband. 

Kathleen Scott decided to travel to New Zealand to meet her husband on his return from Antarctica. She left Liverpool on 4 January 1913 for New York, then travelled by train to New Orleans and El Paso and went camping in Mexico before sailing from California to Tahiti. The bodies of Captain Scott and his companions were discovered on the 12 November 1912 and the news reached London on 11 January 1913 with a memorial service, attended by King George V, being held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 14 February 1913. Five days later a wireless message finally reached the ship Kathleen Scott was on and she was informed of her husband&#x27;s death. She continued on to New Zealand where she was given the diaries and letters which had been recovered when her husband&#x27;s body had been found.

On her return to London Scott, and her son, were the subject of intensive public and press attention which she tried to counter by embarking on a concentrated period of work. She began work on large statues of Captain Scott, Asquith and Captain Edward Smith. In August 1913 she spent some time in Andorra and in 1914 she went to North Africa. After trekking in the Sahara, Scott returned to Britain shortly before World War I began.

===World War I===

During World War I, Scott initially set aside sculpture and worked in a variety of other roles to support the British and Allied war effort. She helped to set up an ambulance service for the French army by transporting vehicles to northern France and raised money and recruited volunteers to support the establishment of Hôpital Temporaire d&#x27;Arc-en-Barrois at the Chateau d&#x27;Arc-en-Barrois where she subsequently worked for a time. Scott then worked on the assembly benches of a Vickers electronics factory at Erith in south London. In England she also worked on three statues connected with the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition. The first to be commissioned, by the mayor of Cheltenham, was her statue of Edward Wilson which was unveiled in July 1914. Her statue of Scott in his naval greatcoat with a husky at his feet was commissioned by officers of the Portsmouth naval base and dockyards and was unveiled in February 1915. Her bronze statue of Captain Scott was unveiled in central London in November 1915, although Scott did not attend the ceremony and spent the day at the Vickers factory. In March 1916 Scott travelled, via Paris and Rome, to the quarry in Carrara, Italy where she carved the white marble Statue of Captain Robert Falcon Scott which was erected at Christchurch Central City, New Zealand, in 1917. In 1917, Scott served as a private secretary to Sir Matthew Nathan in the Ministry of Pensions. She resigned that post towards the end of 1917 but resumed working for the Ministry in Paris for a short while.

During October 1918 Scott began working at the Queen&#x27;s Hospital in Sidcup, creating masks and facial models of wounded patients for the plastic surgeons there, including Harold Gillies, to use in planning their reconstruction operations.

===1920s===
Scott visited Paris immediately after the war ended and worked to promote the formation of the League of Nations. She continued to receive considerable press coverage for her dignified manner as the widow of a national hero while continuing to work as a sculptor. She received numerous commissions for portraits, war memorials and regimental pieces and had three works shown at the Royal Academy in London in 1919. Throughout the inter-war years she had six significant solo exhibitions and continued to regularly show new works at the Royal Academy, with at least one piece shown there every year, except once, between 1920 and 1940. Early in 1920 she visited Italy and during 1921 undertook an extended trip to the United States, Panama, Cuba and Ecuador. During the early 1920s, along with many smaller pieces and statuettes, Scott made a large portrait bust of David Lloyd George, created the &quot;Thinking Soldier&quot; war memorial for Huntingdon and the large male nude, modelled by the 22-year-old Arnold Lawrence, which is now outside the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. 

The Lawrence statue was one of several idealised sculptures of young male nudes that Scott created throughout her career. The Lawrence figure was originally designed by Scott as a war memorial and was exhibited several times at major exhibitions in London and Paris under different titles, such as &quot;Youth&quot; and &quot;These had most to give&quot;. Although it won a medal at the 1925 Paris Salon the work failed to sell and Scott donated it to the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. Despite initial opposition from the Institute&#x27;s board of management, the statue now known as &quot;May Eternal Light Shine Upon Them&quot;, was erected on the forecourt of the Institute&#x27;s new building in 1934 where it serves as a memorial to the 1911–1912 Antarctic Expedition. 

In November 1919 Scott met Edward Hilton Young, an M.P. with a distinguished war record, and they married in March 1922, the ceremony taking place in the St Mary Undercroft crypt of the Palace of Westminster. Later the same year the couple attended the Hague conference on trade with Russia together. Her second son, Wayland Hilton Young, who became a writer and politician, was born the following year. Marriage to a politician suited Scott who had long counted several leading statesmen, most notably Asquith but also Lloyd George, Austen Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin, among her social circle. Asquith, even when Prime Minister, frequently visited Scott&#x27;s studio and regularly wrote to her. Her bust of Asquith is in the Tate collection in London.
From 1927 Scott and her family lived at Leinster Corner near Lancaster Gate in central London overlooking Kensington Gardens, in a house once owned by J. M. Barrie. The property had a coach-house, which she converted into a two-storey high studio, and a large garden where she worked on monumental pieces in the open air. These included a larger than life-size bronze statue of Thomas Cholmondeley, 4th Baron Delamere, on a ten foot base, costing £2,000, for Nairobi, Kenya.

===Later life===
Scott&#x27;s 1929 solo exhibition at the Greatorex Gallery in central London received favourable press reviews and included portrait sculptures of, among others, John Reith, 1st Baron Reith, John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon and Anthony Bernard. Throughout the 1930s, despite bouts of ill health, Scott continued to work and travel. She visited Italy in 1930 and 1936, attended the Paris Salon in 1932 and, most years spent some weeks in Switzerland with her sons. She created a plaque depicting Queen Mary for the ocean liner of the same name, made busts of George V and Neville Chamberlain, a memorial for Poets&#x27; Corner and a statue of the actor Sabu. 

Scott&#x27;s work was in great demand in the years preceding the Second World War. Between 1935 and 1940 she produced a monumental nude figure originally entitled &quot;The Strength Within&quot; and later &quot;England&quot;, plus busts of Montague Norman, George Bernard Shaw and the Prince of Wales, before he became King Edward VIII. She was the subject of BBC Television&#x27;s first programme on sculpture in 1937 and the following year a illustrated volume, &quot;Homage. A Book of Sculptures&quot; was published with text by Stephen Gwynn. At the start of World War II, Scott volunteered to work with plastic surgeons as she had done in World War I but was not called upon although she did host a number of evacuee children at her country cottage in Norfolk near Fritton Lake for a short time.

Throughout her life, Scott remained a traditional sculptor and worked independently of contemporary artistic developments such as modernism and abstraction. Described by the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; as &quot;the most significant and prolific British women sculptor before Barbara Hepworth&quot;, her traditional style of sculpture and her hostility to the abstract work of, for example Henry Moore and, especially, Jacob Epstein. This coupled, with the media emphasis on her being Captain Scott&#x27;s widow, has led to a subsequent lack of recognition for her artistic career. 

Scott died, from leukaemia, at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington, near to her Lancaster Gate home in July 1947. Her funeral service was held at West Overton in Wiltshire where a commemorative plaque is sited. A memorial exhibition of her work was held at the Mansard Gallery in 1947 and two years later her autobiography, &quot;Self Portrait of An Artist&quot; was published. Scott&#x27;s grandchildren include the artist Emily Young and the writer Louisa Young, her biographer.

==Titles==
In 1913, Scott was granted the rank (but not the style) of a widow of a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. This meant that, for the purposes of establishing official precedence, she was treated as if she were the widow of such a knight. However, she was not entitled to be called Lady Scott merely by virtue of this (although she often was), and it did not amount to Captain Scott being posthumously knighted. When her second husband was created Baron Kennet on 15 July 1935, she gained the title Baroness Kennet.

==In popular culture==
Scott was played by the actress Diana Churchill in the 1948 Ealing Studios film &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;, with John Mills as her husband. In 1985, she was played by Susan Wooldridge in the television miniseries &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;, from Central Independent Television, with Martin Shaw as her husband. A BBC Radio play, &quot;Imitations&quot; by Michael Butt, was based on the friendship between Scott and George Bernard Shaw, who frequently sat for her.

<text>Eudyptes is a genus of penguins whose members are collectively called crested penguins. The exact number of species in the genus varies between four and seven depending on the authority, and a Chatham Islands species became extinct in recent centuries. All are black and white penguins with yellow crests, red bills and eyes, and are found on Subantarctic islands in the world&#x27;s southern oceans. All lay two eggs, but raise only one young per breeding season; the first egg laid is substantially smaller than the second.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot; was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816; the name is derived from the Ancient Greek words meaning &quot;fine&quot;, and meaning &quot;diver&quot;. The type species was designated as the southern rockhopper penguin by George Robert Gray in 1840.

Six extant species have been classically recognised, with the recent splitting of the rockhopper penguin increasing it to seven. Conversely, the close relationship of the macaroni and royal penguins, and the erect-crested and Snares penguins have led some to propose that the two pairs should be regarded as species.

Order Sphenisciformes
* Family Spheniscidae
** Fiordland penguin, &quot;Eudyptes pachyrhynchus&quot;
** Snares penguin, &quot;Eudyptes robustus&quot; – has been considered a subspecies of the Fiordland penguin
** Erect-crested penguin, &quot;Eudyptes sclateri&quot;
** Southern rockhopper penguin, &quot;Eudyptes chrysocome&quot;
*** Eastern rockhopper penguin, &quot;Eudyptes (chrysocome) filholi&quot;
*** Western rockhopper penguin, &quot;Eudyptes (chrysocome) chrysocome&quot;
** Northern rockhopper penguin, &quot;Eudyptes moseleyi&quot; – traditionally considered a subspecies of &quot;Eudyptes chrysocome&quot; as the rockhopper penguin.
** Royal penguin, &quot;Eudyptes schlegeli&quot; – sometimes considered a morph of &quot;E. chrysolophus&quot;
** Macaroni penguin, &quot;Eudyptes chrysolophus&quot;
** Chatham penguin, &quot;Eudyptes warhami&quot; (extinct)
The Chatham Islands &quot;Eudyptes warhami&quot; is known only from subfossil bones, and became extinct shortly following human colonisation of the Chatham Islands. This genetically-distinct species was relatively large, with a thin, slim and low bill. (T.L. Cole et al. (2019) Mol. Biol. Evol.)

===Evolution===

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests that the crested penguins split from the ancestors of their closest living relative, the yellow-eyed penguin, in the mid-Miocene around 15 million years ago, before splitting into separate species around 8 million years ago in the late Miocene.

A fossil penguin genus, &quot;Madrynornis&quot;, has been identified as the closest known relative of the crested penguins. Found in late Miocene deposits dated to about 10&quot; &quot;million years ago, it must have separated from the crested penguins around 12&quot; &quot;million years ago. Given that the head ornamentation by yellow filoplumes seems plesiomorphic for the &quot;Eudyptes&quot;-&quot;Megadyptes&quot; lineage, &quot;Madrynornis&quot; probably had them too.
===Extant Species===






==Description==
The crested penguins are all similar in appearance, having sharply delineated black and white plumage with red beaks and prominent yellow crests. Their calls are more complex than those of other species, with several phrases of differing lengths. The royal penguin (mostly) has a white face, while other species have black faces.

==Breeding==
Crested penguins breed on Subantarctic islands in the southern reaches of the world&#x27;s oceans; the greatest diversity occurring around New Zealand and surrounding islands. Their breeding displays and behaviours are generally more complex than other penguin species. Both male and female parents take shifts incubating eggs and young.

Crested penguins lay two eggs, but almost always raise only one young successfully. All species exhibit the odd phenomenon of &quot;egg-size dimorphism&quot; in breeding; the first egg (or A-egg) laid is substantially smaller than the second egg (B-egg). This is most extreme in the macaroni penguin, where the first egg averages only 60% the size of the second. The reason for this is a mystery remains unknown, although several theories have been proposed. British ornithologist David Lack theorized that the genus was evolving toward the laying of a one-egg clutch. Experiments with egg substitution have shown that A-eggs can produce viable chicks that were only 7% lighter at time of fledging. Physiologically, the first egg is smaller because it develops while the mother is still at sea swimming and thus has less energy to invest in the egg.

Recently, brooding royal and erect-crested penguins have been reported to tip the smaller eggs out as the second is laid.

<text>The General Anthroposophical Society is an &quot;association of people whose will it is to nurture the life of the soul, both in the individual and in human society, on the basis of a true knowledge of the spiritual world.&quot; As an organization, it is dedicated to supporting the community of those interested in the inner path of schooling known as anthroposophy, developed by Rudolf Steiner.

The &quot;Anthroposophical Society&quot; was founded on December 28, 1912 in Cologne, Germany, with about 3000 members. Central to this founding was Rudolf Steiner, who acted as an advisor and lecturer. The members of its original Executive Council were Marie von Sivers, Michael Bauer, and Carl Unger. The Society was re-founded as the &quot;General Anthroposophical Society&quot; in 1923/4 in Dornach, Switzerland. It includes an esoteric &quot;School of Spiritual Science&quot;.

The Society&#x27;s headquarters is at the Goetheanum, located in Dornach, Solothurn, Switzerland. The Society has national Societies in many countries, including every English-speaking country. Its primary activities include organizing members&#x27; meetings and conferences, supporting research, and providing communication channels for a variety of purposes. The Society also encourages sustainable initiatives in the many practical fields in which its members are active.

As of 2013, the Society has approximately 52,000 members. Formal branches of the Society have been established in 50 countries, and smaller groups are active in 50 further countries. About 10,000 institutions base their work on anthroposophy, including schools, farms, medical practices, and communities for the handicapped.

==Origins==
The Anthroposophical Society traces its history back to 1902, when Rudolf Steiner became General Secretary of the German branch of the Theosophical Society. Prior to this time, Theosophy had made little headway in Germany; despite some visits by Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society, to Germany and its prominent Theosophists, it was not until after her death in 1891 that a single Berlin Lodge was officially chartered in 1894. Its nominal leadership by Dr Huebbe-Schleiden was supported by the ongoing efforts of Count and Countess Brockdorff, under whose auspices Steiner was first asked to lecture to an audience including German Theosophists in August 1900. His spiritual ideas found a responsive audience here, as many German Theosophists had found in Theosophy only an imperfect reflection of their own beliefs.

Throughout Steiner&#x27;s term in office, the German branch worked quite independently of the rest of the Theosophical Society; in particular, Steiner sought to link to European philosophy and science and to Christian esoteric traditions, while the Theosophical Society was both geographically and spiritually based in Adyar, India.

Besant&#x27;s tolerance for the differences in their approaches grew strained over the years. By 1907, Steiner had shifted from Theosophical terminology to his own vocabulary and the uniqueness of his approach was becoming increasingly apparent, for example at the &quot;International Congress&quot; at Munich in May 1907. Later that year, &quot;by mutual consent&quot;, the esoteric circle Steiner had founded as an offshoot of the Theosophical Society&#x27;s &quot;Esoteric Section&quot; (&quot;E. S.&quot;) became a wholly independent institution.

Gathering tensions over a variety of issues, including the rapid growth of the German section and its increasing activity in areas outside of Germany, came to a head when the leadership of the Theosophical Society declared that they had found the reincarnated Christ in a young boy named Jiddu Krishnamurti. Followers of Krishnamurti, most of whom were Theosophists, founded the &quot;Order of the Star in the East&quot; in 1911. Steiner&#x27;s opposition to this order was made unmistakable by his 1912 declaration that no member of the new Order could remain a member of the German Theosophical Society. By the end of that year, Besant had induced the General Council of the Theosophical Society to revoke the charter for the German Section, which was under Steiner&#x27;s leadership. In February 1913, Steiner and a group of prominent German theosophists founded a new society, the Anthroposophical Society, with the intent of pursuing a more Western path of spirituality than that nurtured in the Theosophical Society.

The German branch had numbered only a single Lodge and a few individual members when Steiner became its head in 1902. By 1913, it had burgeoned to 69 Lodges, 55 of which (about 2,500 people) left with Steiner to be part of the new Anthroposophical Society. The General Council of the Theosophical Society issued a new charter to the 14 Lodges which remained in the Theosophical Society, which were once again led by Dr Huebbe-Schleiden. The early Anthroposophical Society was predominantly German-speaking, though there were some founding members from other European countries, particularly the Netherlands. Its inaugural general meeting was held in January 1913 at Berlin. English anthroposophy was limited to a small anonymous club until after World War I.

After a split occurred between younger members, many of whom were founding or active in new initiatives such as a school, a curative home for the handicapped, a medical clinic, and a farm, and who had formed their own &quot;Free Anthroposophical Society&quot;, and the older members, the anthroposophical society was formally refounded, with new leadership, in December 1923. Both groups came together in the new version of the society.

A conference was first called to refound the society. At this conference, which became known as the &quot;Christmas Conference&quot;, Steiner suggested that a meditative verse he had created for the occasion, the , should become the spiritual cornerstone of a renewed anthroposophical movement. This movement should for the first time become unified with the Society that nurtured it. At this time, the Anthroposophical Society was renamed as the &quot;General Anthroposophical Society&quot; and affiliated national societies were formed.

Steiner gave a series of lectures on world history over the course of the eight-day conference, and established a &quot;School of Spiritual Science&quot; as his esoteric school, which became a new focus for &#x27;esoteric&#x27; commitment and authority. While there was no requirement for membership in the General Anthroposophic Society, First Class members had to have been members of the General Society for 2 years, and accept &#x27;inner responsibility&#x27; for Anthroposophy.&quot;

==History==
On November 1, 1935, the National Socialist regime banned the society in Germany for its &quot;close relations with foreign freemasons, Jews and pacifists.&quot; The order issued by Reinhard Heydrich stated that, as a result of its opposition to the National Socialistic idea of Volk, the activities of the Anthroposophical Society endangered the National Socialistic state. Jewish teachers at the Waldorf schools were consequently dismissed.

From the 1930s until the 1960s, disputes over two separate issues, publishing rights for Steiner&#x27;s books and the spiritual direction of the society, led to the Anthroposophical Society being effectively divided into several groups with little connection. Through efforts on all sides, the splinter groups merged again into the present Society in the early 1960s.

==Organization==

===United States===
The Anthroposophical Society in America, headquartered in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is one of over seventy national societies of the international General Anthroposophical Society, headquartered at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland. The American Society has branches, groups, and sections in over 36 states.

The goal of the Anthroposophical Society in America is to further the work of Rudolf Steiner. It is a non-sectarian, non-political association devoted to such ends. It supports study groups, regional branches, the School for Spiritual Science in North America, and the Rudolf Steiner Library.

The administrative offices for the U.S. Society are located at the Rudolf Steiner House, 1923 Geddes Avenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The U.S. Society is governed by a General Council. Current members of the General Council are
*Mary Stewart Adams, General Secretary and President
*Leah Walker, Secretary
*Gino Ver Eecke, Interim Chair and Eastern Region Representative
*Christine Burke, Western Region Representative
*Margaret Runyon, Member at large.

A partial list of branches follows:
* The Chicago Branch
* The Los Angeles Branch
* The New York City Branch
* The Seattle Branch

==Principles==
The founding principles of the society were:

# The Anthroposophical Society is to be an association of people whose will it is to nurture the life of the soul, both in the individual and in human society, on the basis of a true knowledge of the spiritual world.
# The persons gathered at the Goetheanum in Dornach at Christmas, 1923, both the individuals and the groups represented, form the nucleus of the Society. They are convinced that there exists in our time a genuine science of the spiritual world, elaborated for years past, and in important particulars already published; and that the civilisation of today is lacking the cultivation of such a science. This cultivation is to be the task of the Anthroposophical Society. It will endeavour to fulfill this task by making the anthroposophical spiritual science cultivated at the Goetheanum in Dornach the centre of its activities, together with all that results from this for brotherhood in human relationships and for the moral and religious as well as the artistic and cultural life.
# The persons gathered in Dornach as the nucleus of the Society recognise and endorse the view of the leadership at the Goetheanum (represented by the Vorstand [Executive Council] formed at the Foundation Meeting): &#x27;Anthroposophy, as fostered at the Goetheanum, leads to results which can serve every human being as a stimulus to spiritual life, whatever his nation, social standing or religion. They can lead to a social life genuinely built on brotherly love. No special degree of academic learning is required to make them one&#x27;s own and to found one&#x27;s life upon them, but only an open-minded human nature. Research into these results, however, as well as competent evaluation of them, depends upon spiritual-scientific training, which is to be acquired step by step. These results are in their own way as exact as the results of genuine natural science. When they attain general recognition in the same way as these, they will bring about comparable progress in all spheres of life, not only in the spiritual but also in the practical realm.&#x27;
# The Anthroposophical Society is in no sense a secret society, but is entirely public. Anyone can become a member, without regard to nationality, social standing, religion, scientific or artistic conviction, who considers as justified the existence of an institution such as the Goetheanum in Dornach, in its capacity as a School of Spiritual Science. The Anthroposophical Society rejects any kind of sectarian activity. Party politics it considers not to be within its task.
# The Anthroposophical Society sees the School of Spiritual Science in Dornach as a centre for its activity. The School will be composed of three classes. Members of the Society will be admitted to the School on their own application after a period of membership to be determined by the leadership at the Goetheanum. They enter in this way the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science. Admission to the Second or Third Classes takes place when the person requesting this is deemed eligible by the leadership at the Goetheanum.
# Every member of the Anthroposophical Society has the right to attend all lectures, performances and meetings arranged by the society, under conditions to be announced by the Vorstand.
# The organising of the school of Spiritual Science is, to begin with, the responsibility of Rudolf Steiner, who will appoint his collaborators and his possible successor.
# All publications of the Society shall be public, in the same sense as are those of other public societies. The publications of the School of Spiritual Science will form no exception as regards this public character; however, the leadership of the School reserves the right to deny in advance the validity of any judgment on these publications which is not based on the same training from which they have been derived. Consequently, they will regard as justified no judgement which is not based on an appropriate preliminary training, as is also the common practice in the recognised scientific world. Thus the publications of the School of Spiritual Science will bear the following note: &#x27;Printed as manuscript for members of the School of Spiritual Science, Goetheanum, … Class. No one is considered competent to judge the content, who has not acquired - through the School itself or in a manner recognised by the School as equivalent - the requisite preliminary knowledge. Other opinions will be disregarded, to the extent that the authors of such works will not enter into a discussion about them.&#x27;
# The purpose of the Anthroposophical Society will be the furtherance of spiritual research; that of the School of Spiritual Science will be this research itself. A dogmatic stand in any field whatsoever is to be excluded from the Anthroposophical Society.
# The Anthroposophical Society shall hold a regular General Meeting at the Goetheanum each year, at which time the Vorstand shall present a full report with accounting. The agenda for this meeting shall be communicated by the Vorstand to all members, together with the invitation, six weeks before the meeting. The Vorstand may call special meetings and fix the agenda for them. Invitations to such meetings shall be sent to members three weeks in advance. Motions proposed by individual members or groups of members shall be submitted one week before the General Meeting.
# Members may join together in smaller or larger groups on any basis of locality or subject. The headquarters of the Anthroposophical Society is at the Goetheanum. From there the Vorstand shall bring to the attention of the members or groups of members what it considers to be the task of the Society. The Vorstand communicates with officials elected or appointed by the various groups. Admission of members will be the concern of the individual groups; the certificate of membership shall, however, be placed before the Vorstand in Dornach, and shall be signed by them out of their confidence in the officials of the groups. In general, every member should join a group. Only those for whom it is quite impossible to find entry to a group should apply directly to Dornach for membership.
# Membership dues shall be fixed by the individual groups; each group shall, however, submit 15 Swiss Francs for each of its members to the central leadership of the Society at the Goetheanum.
# Each working group formulates its own statutes, but these must not be incompatible with the Statutes of the Anthroposophical Society.
# The organ of the society is the weekly &quot;Das Goetheanum&quot;, which for this purpose is provided with a supplement containing the official communications of the Society. This enlarged edition of &quot;Das Goetheanum&quot; will be supplied to members of the Anthroposophical Society only.
# The Founding Vorstand will be:
::*President: Dr. Rudolf Steiner
::*Vice-President: Albert Steffen
::*Recorder: Dr. Ita Wegman
::*Members: Marie Steiner and Dr. Elisabeth Vreede
::*Secretary and Treasurer: Dr. Guenther Wachsmuth

These principles were originally intended to serve as statutes as well; the legal requirements of registering such societies led to an expanded set of statutes, however.

<doc id="697826" wikidata="Q7280945" url="?curid=697826" title="Radio Norwich">
<text>Radio Norwich is a fictional radio station in Norwich, England, in the television series &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;. It parodies elements from both BBC Local Radio and Independent Local Radio.

The title character, played by Steve Coogan, can be seen on-air at the beginning of several episodes, usually hosting phone ins on various inane topics (for example: &quot;Which is the best &quot;Lord&quot;: &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;of the Dance&quot;, or &quot;of the Flies&quot;?&quot;) Partridge can also often be seen bickering with DJ Dave Clifton (played by Phil Cornwell), who takes the slots after his own in both series of the show.

In real-life, Norwich and Norfolk are served by BBC Radio Norfolk. A real-life commercial radio station named 99.9 Radio Norwich launched on 29 June 2006. It closed on 1 September 2020 when it was replaced by Greatest Hits Radio.

==Radio shows==
Alan hosts different radio shows on each of the two series. In the first series he hosts an early morning slot, &quot;Up With The Partridge&quot; (4am7am), whilst in the second series he hosts &quot;Norfolk Nights&quot; (10pm1am). Each of his shows in both series were followed by Dave Clifton&#x27;s two shows, &quot;The Breakfast Show&quot; and &quot;Dave Clifton&#x27;s Nightclub&quot;. In series two, Alan claims he has &quot;the third best slot&quot; on Radio Norwich. A point he also makes several times during the second series is that he also hosts &quot;Skirmish&quot;, a military-based general knowledge quiz show on digital cable television channel UK Conquest. He also goes on to say that the show &quot;boasts the largest audience share of a daytime digital channel at that time of day, in the Norfolk area&quot;.

Elements in his radio shows included:
* Super Talk (brought to you by Ginsters pasties)
* Alan&#x27;s Deep Bath (brought to you by Dettol)
* Alan&#x27;s Fact of the Day
* Cock-a-Doodle-Who?

==Filming locations==
The exterior of Radio Norwich is the offices of UBC Media Group at 50 Lisson Street, London. Alan&#x27;s studio is UBC&#x27;s radio production studio on the first floor of the building. This studio (which had subsequently been refurbished) was also used for the filming of Alan&#x27;s later series &quot;Mid-Morning Matters&quot;.

<doc id="697827" wikidata="Q1118068" url="?curid=697827" title="Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts">
<text>The Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts (, ) is an extensive piece of reform legislation signed into law by Francis I of France on August 10, 1539, in the city of Villers-Cotterêts and the oldest French legislation still used partly by French courts.

Largely the work of Chancellor Guillaume Poyet, the legislative edict had 192 articles and dealt with a number of government, judicial and ecclesiastical matters ().

==Articles 110 and 111==
Articles 110 and 111, the most famous, and the oldest still in use in the French legislation, called for the use of French in all legal acts, notarized contracts and official legislation to avoid any linguistic confusion:

The major goal of these articles was to discontinue the use of Latin in official documents (although Latin continued to be used in church registers in some regions of France), but they also had an effect on the use of the other languages and dialects spoken in many regions of France.

==Registrations of births and deaths==
The ordinance was part of a wider legislation regarding the policing of church benefices, to keep vital records registers in the various church local institutions (mainly parishes). The ordinance ordered the creation of at least a register of baptisms, needed for determining the age of candidates for ecclesiastical office, as a proof of one&#x27;s date of birth, and a register of burials of churchmen, as a proof of one&#x27;s date of death. Though both registers were kept by religious authorities, they were authenticated by a public notary, always a layman, and were kept in the local royal administration&#x27;s archives. In fact, as the church kept parish registers since the Middle Ages (the oldest one in France is Giry&#x27;s, of 1303), these registers were used to meet the ordinance&#x27;s dispositions.

The national registration was fully laicized in 1792 during the French Revolution by order of the French Republic. These records have continued until the present and are kept at the departmental archives. The civil registration now includes birth, marriage, divorce, and death records.

==Other articles==
Another article prohibited guilds and trade federations () in an attempt to suppress workers&#x27; strikes (although mutual-aid groups were unaffected).

==Effects==
Many of these clauses marked a move towards an expanded, unified and centralized state and the clauses on the use of French marked a major step towards the linguistic and ideological unification of France at a time of growing national sentiment and identity.

Despite the effort to bring clarity to the complex systems of justice and administration prevailing in different parts of France and to make them more accessible, Article 111 left uncertainty in failing to define the &quot;French mother tongue&quot;. Many varieties of French were spoken around the country, to say nothing of sizeable regional minorities like Occitans, Bretons and Basques whose mother tongue was not French at all.

It was not until 1794 that the government decreed French to be the only language of the state for all official business, a situation still in force under Article 2 of the current French Constitution.

<doc id="697831" wikidata="Q752721" url="?curid=697831" title="Carew Castle">
<text>Carew Castle () is a castle in the civil parish of Carew in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The Carew family take their name from this site and have owned the castle for more than 900 years. It is leased to the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park for administration purposes.

==Construction==
The present castle, which replaced an earlier stone keep, is constructed almost entirely from the local Carboniferous limestone, except for some of the Tudor architectural features such as window frames, which are made from imported Cotswold stone. Although originally a Norman stronghold the castle maintains a mixture of architectural styles as modifications were made to the structure over successive centuries.

Entry to the inner ward is across a dry moat that had a barbican and gatehouse. The front of the castle had three D-shaped towers and crenelated walls. The rear of the castle has two large round towers. In the 16th century the northern defensive wall was converted into a Tudor range with ornate windows and long gallery.

The outer ward has earthworks that were built by Royalist defenders during the English Civil War in the 1640s.

==History==
The use of the site for military purposes extends back at least 2000 years.

===Early history===
The castle stands on a limestone bluff overlooking the Carew inlet, part of the tidal estuary that makes up the Milford Haven Waterway. The site must have been recognised as strategically useful from the earliest times, and recent excavations in the outer ward have discovered multiple defensive walls of an Iron Age fort.

The Norman castle has its origins in a stone keep built by Gerald de Windsor around the year 1100. Gerald was made castellan of Pembroke Castle by Arnulf of Montgomery in the first Norman invasion of Pembrokeshire. He married Nest, princess of Deheubarth around 1095. Nest brought the manor of Carew as part of her dowry, and Gerald cleared the existing fort to build his own castle on Norman lines. The original outer walls were timber, and only the keep was of stone. This still exists in the later structure as the &quot;Old Tower&quot;.

===Medieval===

Gerald&#x27;s son William took the name &quot;de Carew&quot;, and in the middle of the 12th century created an enclosure with stone walls incorporating the original keep, and a &quot;Great Hall&quot; inside it. The current high-walled structure with a complex of rooms and halls around the circumference was created in about 1270 by Nicholas de Carew (d.1297), concurrent with (and influenced by) the construction of the Edwardian castles in North Wales. At this time, the outer ward was also walled in.

===Tudor period===

The de Carews fell on hard times in the post-Black Death period and mortgaged the castle. It fell into the hands of Rhys ap Thomas, who made his fortune by strategically changing sides and backing Henry VII just before the battle of Bosworth.

Rewarded with lands and a knighthood, he extended the castle with luxurious apartments with many Tudor features in the late 15th century. An inner doorway is decorated with three coats of arms: those of Henry VII, his son Arthur and Arthur&#x27;s wife Catherine of Aragon. This allegiance turned sour. Rhys&#x27; grandson Rhys ap Gruffudd fell out of favour and was executed by Henry VIII for treason in 1531. The castle thus reverted to the crown and was leased to various tenants. In 1558 it was acquired by Sir John Perrot, a Lord Deputy of Ireland, who completed the final substantial modifications of the castle. The Elizabethan plutocrat reconstructed the north walls to build a long range of domestic rooms.

===Demise===

Perrot subsequently fell out of favour and died imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1592. The castle reverted to the crown and was finally re-purchased by the de Carew family in 1607. In the Civil War, the castle was refortified by Royalists although south Pembrokeshire was strongly Parliamentarian. After changing hands three times, the south wall was pulled down to render the castle indefensible to Royalists. At the Restoration the castle was returned to the de Carews, who continued to occupy the eastern wing until 1686.

The castle was then abandoned and allowed to decay. Much of the structure was looted for building stone and for lime burning. Since 1984 Cadw has funded a substantial amount of restoration performed by the Pembrokeshire National Park Authority.

==Tidal mill==
Carew Tidal Mill is the only restored tidal mill in Wales. The origins of the mill are undocumented but evidence suggests that a mill was in existence on the site by 1542. It is often called the &quot;French Mill&quot; and this may have arisen from its use of French millstones. Causeway walls and floodgates were restored by Sir John Carew in about 1615. One of the mill wheels is dated 1801. Use of the mill ended in 1937 and the building became derelict.

<doc id="697832" wikidata="Q7248110" url="?curid=697832" title="Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom">
<text>The history of professional wrestling in the United Kingdom spans over one hundred years. After a brief spell of popularity for Greco Roman professional wrestling during the Edwardian era, the first catch-as-catch-can based scene began in the 1930s, when it was popularised under the concept of &quot;All-in Wrestling&quot;, which emphasised an &quot;anything goes&quot; style and presentation. Following World War II, the style and presentation of professional wrestling in the UK underwent a dramatic shift, as the Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules were introduced to make British professional wrestling appear much closer to a legitimate sport. Professional wrestling entered the mainstream British culture when the newly-formed independent television network ITV began broadcasting it in 1955, firstly on Saturday afternoons and then also in a late-night midweek slot. Domestically produced professional wrestling was at its peak of popularity when the television show &quot;World of Sport&quot; was launched in the mid-1960s, making household names out of Adrian Street, Mick McManus, Giant Haystacks, Jackie Pallo, Big Daddy, Mark Rocco, Steve Veidor, Dynamite Kid, and Kendo Nagasaki. 

An upmarket rebrand of ITV&#x27;s sports coverage, alongside the entry of the American World Wrestling Federation into the market in the late 1980s, contributed to a decline in support for domestic British wrestling and stars. In 1985, &quot;World of Sport&quot; ended, and a subsequent stand-alone wrestling programme lasted until the end of 1988. Without mainstream television access, domestically produced professional wrestling would struggle in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the largely untelevised live circuit survived and at times thrived with some promotions featuring the traditional British style of wrestling, while others adopted the contemporary American independent style.

In the 21st century, mirroring the growing strength of the Independent circuit in the United States, support for domestic professional wrestling once again began to grow, leading to the rise of several prominent and stable independent wrestling promotions throughout the United Kingdom. This, combined with strategic partnerships with Japanese professional wrestling promotions, allowed for a new generation of professional wrestlers such as Will Ospreay, Zack Sabre Jr. and Pete Dunne to rise to prominence internationally.

==History==
===Folk-wrestling roots and Greco Roman wrestling boom===
For many centuries, there have been wrestling tournaments (for example in Cornish wrestling, Lancashire wrestling or Scottish Backhold) throughout the British Isles where individual prizes have been comparable to yearly salaries and where monarchs and lords have been in the audiences or indeed participated.

At the start of the 20th century, wrestling was introduced to the public as part of a variety act to spice up the limited action involved in the bodybuilder strongman attractions. One of its earliest stars was a Cornish-American ex-miner named Jack Carkeek (world Cornish wrestling champion in 1886), who would challenge audience members to last ten minutes with him in the ring.

The development of wrestling within the UK brought legitimate Greco-Roman grappler Georg Hackenschmidt who was born in the Russian Empire to the country, where he would quickly associate himself with promoter and entrepreneur Charles B. Cochran. Cochran took Hackenschmidt under his wing and booked him into a match in which Hackenschmidt defeated another top British wrestler, Tom Cannon, for the European Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship. This win gave Hackenschmidt a credible claim to the world title, cemented in 1905 with a win over American Heavyweight Champion Tom Jenkins in the United States. Hackenschmidt took a series of bookings in Manchester for a then impressive £150 a week. Noting Hackenschmidt&#x27;s legitimately dominant style of wrestling threatened to kill crowd interest, Cochran persuaded Hackenschmidt to learn showmanship from Cannon and wrestle many of his matches for entertainment rather than sport; this displayed the future elements of &quot;sports entertainment&quot;.

Numerous big-name stars came and went during the early inception of wrestling within the UK, with many, like Hackenschmidt, leaving for the US. The resulting loss of big-name stars sent the business into decline before the outbreak of World War I in 1914 halted it completely.

===1930s: All-in wrestling===
While various styles of amateur wrestling continued as legitimate sports, grappling as a promotional business did not return to Britain until the beginning of the 1930s when the success of the more worked aspects of professional wrestling in America, like gimmickry and showmanship, were introduced to British wrestling. It was with this revival that the more submission-based Catch As Catch Can wrestling style, which had already replaced Greco Roman wrestling as the dominant style of professional wrestling in the United States back in the 1890s, became the new dominant style in Britain. With Lancashire style catch-as-catch-can already a major amateur sport particularly in Northern England, there existed a ready-made source of potential recruits to professional wrestling.

Amateur wrestler, Sir Atholl Oakeley got together with fellow grappler Henry Irslinger to launch one of the first promotions to employ the new style of wrestling which was coined &quot;All-in&quot; wrestling. Though, like many wrestlers throughout the business, Oakeley would claim his wrestling was entirely legitimate, his claim was highly dubious. Under the British Wrestling Association banner, Oakeley&#x27;s promotion took off with wrestlers such as Tommy Mann, Black Butcher Johnson, Jack Pye, Norman &quot;the Butcher&quot; Ansell, &quot;College Boy&quot;, and Jack Sherry on the roster, while Oakeley himself would win a series of matches to be crowned the first British Heavyweight Champion.

The business was reaching one of its highest points at the time, with the best part of forty regular venues in London alone. The great demand for wrestling, however, meant there were not enough skilled amateurs to go around, and many promoters switched to more violent styles, with weapons and chairshots part of the proceedings. Women wrestlers and mud-filled rings also became common place. In the late 1930s, the London County Council banned professional wrestling, leaving the business in rough shape just before World War II.

===1940s: Mountevans&#x27; committee===
After the war, attempts to relaunch the business in 1947 failed to catch on with journalists, who condemned the gimmickry of professional wrestling as &quot;fake&quot;. The revelation of this, and the general chaos which had surrounded &quot;All In&quot; Wrestling prior to the War prompted Admiral Lord Mountevans, a fan of the sport, to collaborate with Commander Campbell (a member of the popular &quot;The Brains Trust&quot; radio panel show), member of parliament Maurice Webb and Olympic wrestler Norman Morell to create a committee to produce official rules for wrestling. These rules became known as Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules.

The most notable action of the committee was to create seven formal weight divisions, calling for champions to be crowned at each weight. These weight divisions included lightweight (154-pound limit), welterweight (165), middleweight (176), heavy middleweight (187), light heavyweight (198), mid heavyweight (209), and heavyweight. Many of these rules diverged heavily from those used in American Wrestling – five-minute rounds (three minutes for title matches), two public warnings for rule breaking before a disqualification, &quot;knockouts&quot; (countouts) and disqualifications counting as automatic two falls in best of three falls matches (which were predominant), and no follow-up moves allowed on a grounded opponent. Similar rule systems were adopted by most major promotions in mainland Western Europe (although French wrestling abandoned rounds early on.)

The existence of the committee was readily acknowledged by promoters who used its existence to counter any accusations of wrongdoings within the business. It was the promoters themselves, however, who revolutionized the business. During this time, under the guise of an alliance of promoters attempting to regulate the sport and uphold the committee&#x27;s ideas, the promoters created a cartel based on America&#x27;s National Wrestling Alliance territory system that was designed to carve up control of the business among a handful of promoters—which it did in 1952 under the name of Joint Promotions.

===Joint Promotions===

Joint Promotions was represented in London by the Dale Martin promotion, which had incorporated in 1948, and involved Les Martin, and the brothers Jack, Johnny and Billy Dale. Other promoters included Norman Morell and Ted Beresford in Yorkshire, Billy Best in Liverpool, Arthur Wright in Manchester and George de Relywyskow in Scotland, with Arthur Green the secretary of the group. By agreeing to rotate talent and block out rival promoters, Joint Promotions was soon running 40 shows a week, while leaving wrestlers with little bargaining power. The financial advantages of this arrangement helped the members survive the tough conditions caused by a post-war tax that took 25% of all entertainment revenue. Other promoters were not so successful. The closure of Harringay Arena in 1954 was the last straw for Atholl Oakeley, and Joint Promotions were the only major player left to benefit when Chancellor Peter Thorneycroft abolished the entertainment tax in the 1957 budget.

From a press report, some wrestlers decided to go on strike against the Joint Promotions cartel and formed the &quot;Wrestlers&#x27; Welfare Society&quot; for hardship relief but also to act as an employment agency. Bill Benny (&#x27;Man Mountain&#x27;, 1918, Cornwall - 1963, Manchester) wrestler, promoter and nightclubs owner, was a founder and was quoted, &quot;We&#x27;re the pirates&quot;.

One of Joint Promotions&#x27; first moves was establishing (and controlling) the championships called for by the Mountevans&#x27; committee. At first, this proved a profitable venture, with title matches leading to raised ticket prices. However, perhaps inevitably, attempts to extend this success by bringing in additional titles led to overexposure. While the World and British titles had some credibility (particularly as they were often placed on the more legitimate wrestlers), the addition of European, Empire/Commonwealth, Scottish, Welsh, and area championships got out of hand, and at one point there were conceivably 70 different titleholders to keep track of within Joint Promotions alone. In practice, the British, European and World titles were given most prominence. The &quot;regional&quot; titles were mainly honorific, with only the &quot;southern Area&quot; titles actually being fought for. The Empire/Commonwealth titles were a &quot;long stop&quot; title, being used by promotions outside of the Joint monopoly, for the most part.

===1950s: Introduction of British wrestling to television audiences===
But while titles had some success, it was television that took British wrestling to the next level. The first show aired on ABC and ATV (the weekend franchise holders on ITV) on 9 November 1955, featuring Francis St Clair Gregory (9 times Cornish wrestling heavyweight title holder and father of Tony St Clair) versus Mike Marino and Cliff Beaumont versus Bert Royal live from West Ham baths. The show was successful, and wrestling became a featured attraction every Saturday afternoon from autumn to spring each year. In 1964, it went full-time as part of the &quot;World of Sport&quot; sports compilation programme.

Televised wrestling allowed wrestlers to become household names and allowed personality to get a wrestler over just as much as size. The exposure of wrestling on television proved the ultimate boost to the live event business as wrestling became part of mainstream culture. By the mid-1960s, Joint Promotions had doubled their live event schedule to somewhere in the region of 4,500 shows a year. Every town of note had a show at least once a month, and at some points more than 30 cities had a weekly date.

The style of wrestling at the time was unique – not only in terms of the rule system, but also for the strong emphasis on clean technical wrestling. Heels made up a minority of the roster, with most shows containing an abnormally high proportion of clean sportsmanly matches between two &quot;blue-eyes&quot; (as faces were known backstage in the UK). This continued for several decades. Gimmick matches were a rarity, and midget wrestling failed to catch on, while women were banned by the Greater London Council until the late 1980s. Tag wrestling, however, did prove to be popular, with televised tag matches happening a mere eight or so times a year to keep them special.

The success of wrestling on television did however create a better opportunity for the independent groups. The opposition to Joint came from the Australian-born promoter, Paul Lincoln. Having promoted shows in the 1950s with himself in the main event as masked heel Doctor Death, Lincoln led a consortium of independent promoters under the British Wrestling Federation (BWF) whose name was used for a rival championship, built around Heavyweight champion Bert Assirati who split away from Joint Promotions in 1958 while still champion. Although Joint Promotions considered the title vacant and held a tournament for a new champion (won by Billy Joyce), Assirati continued to claim it within the BWF.

The group later built itself around a new champion in Shirley Crabtree, a young bodybuilder who won the title after it was vacated by Assirati while injured in 1960. The BWF faded away in the late 1960s after a campaign by a disgruntled Assirati (vastly superior as a shooter to Crabtree) in the form of unsolicited appearances and challenges to his successor at BWF shows, eventually resulting in the abrupt retirement of Crabtree in 1966. Lincoln&#x27;s own promotion was bought out and amalgamated into Joint Promotions at the end of the 1960s.

===1970s–1980s: Max Crabtree and Big Daddy===
By 1975, the stranglehold of Joint Promotions had almost crumbled, with many of its founding members retiring and the company being bought out several times, leading to the wrestling industry being run as a private subsidiary of state-run bookmakers William Hill PLC, a public company whose staff had little experience of the unique business. Finally, promotions were left in the hands of Max Crabtree, the brother of Shirley, who was headhunted by Joint as the most experienced booker still in the business.

Crabtree produced the next boom in British wrestling by creating the legend of Big Daddy, the alter ego of Shirley, who had been unemployed for the best part of 6 years before joining Joint in 1972 as the heel &quot;Battling Guardsman&quot; and then being rebranded as Big Daddy two years later. After an initial transition period as a heel/tweener in the mid-1970s (most notable for his tag team partnership with future arch-rival Giant Haystacks and a heel vs heel feud with legendary masked wrestler Kendo Nagasaki, whom Daddy unmasked during a 1975 televised bout), from the summer of 1977 onwards, Big Daddy became a larger-than-life fan favourite of children and pensioners alike. That he was no longer a bodybuilder youth, rather an overweight man in his forties, did not seem to be an obstacle as every major heel in the country was defeated by Daddy. This was usually in short order with Daddy gaining quick wins in his few singles matches and cleaning up quickly when tagged into his more frequent tag matches. Disgruntled contemporaries such as Adrian Street have attributed this to Shirley&#x27;s lack of conditioning, although Max in response insisted that this was what people wanted to see.

Big Daddy became one of the best-known wrestlers in British history and even had his own comic strip in &quot;Buster&quot; comic. Due to his popularity, Crabtree&#x27;s run was extended by carefully positioning him in tag matches, allowing a host of young partners (which included Young David, Dynamite Kid, Chris Adams, Sammy Lee, Kwik Kick Lee and Steve Regal) to carry the match before tagging Daddy in for the finish. 

Basing a whole cartel around one performer, however, though good for television, produced mixed results for live events. While Big Daddy was a massive draw in terms of family audiences, in equal part he alienated much of the existing adult fanbase for wrestling. Many wrestlers shared the adult fans&#x27; dislike of the Big Daddy phenomenon. They were dissatisfied with their position within the Joint Promotions and soon looked elsewhere for exposure mainly outside the UK as a whole. As a result, there was a rise in New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Stampede Wrestling&#x27;s junior-heavyweight divisions, both of which had their roots in British wrestling of the time.

===1980s–1990s: End of ITV era and aftermath===
One English promoter that benefited from the backlash against the Crabtrees was Merseyside promoter Brian Dixon, operator of All Star Wrestling which began capitalizing on this disaffection by taking many of Joint Promotions&#x27; top stars and running shows head to head with them on the same night in the same town.

Professional wrestling as a whole seemingly began to fall into disarray as the true nature of wrestling began to fall into question as many newspapers tried to expose the worked aspects of the sport. However, this trend did not ultimately harm the industries as the suspension of disbelief was all too easy to maintain for fans, even if they knew the truth. On 28 September 1985, the Crabtrees received another blow when &quot;World of Sport&quot; was taken off the air. Wrestling instead got its own show, but the time slot changed from week to week, slowly driving away the regular audience. Far worse for Joint Promotions, however, was that with their contract up for renewal at the start of 1987, they were forced to share the TV rights as part of a rotation system with All Star Wrestling and America&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

The introduction of American wrestling to the UK and the eventual axing in 1988 by Greg Dyke of Wrestling shows on terrestrial TV saw the eclipse of Joint Promotions from its dominant position in the British wrestling scene. The promotion, renamed Ring Wrestling Stars (RWS) in 1991, continued to tour the old venues with Big Daddy in the headline slot until his retirement in December 1993 after suffering a stroke. Even then, Max Crabtree continued to tour, using the same business model, with British-born former WWF star &quot;British Bulldog&quot; Davey Boy Smith replacing Daddy as the headlining household name, until Smith was lured back to the WWF in the summer of 1994. Thereafter, RWS went into decline and eventually ceased promoting in 1995.

By contrast, All Star had used its two years of TV exposure to build up a returning Kendo Nagasaki as its lead heel and established such storylines as his tag team-cum-feud with Rollerball Rocco and his &quot;hypnotism&quot; of Robbie Brookside. The end of TV coverage left many of these storylines at a cliffhanger and consequently, All Star underwent a box office boom as hardcore fans turned up to live shows to see what happened next, and kept coming for several years due to careful use of show-to-show storylines. Headline matches frequently pitted Nagasaki in violent heel vs heel battles against the likes of Rocco, Dave &#x27;Fit&#x27; Finlay, Skull Murphy (Peter Northey) and even Giant Haystacks, or at smaller venues teaming with regular partner &quot;Blondie&quot; Bob Barrett or “Ravishing” Robbie Hagen to usually defeat blue-eye opposition. 

Many British wrestlers also continued to appear on television, alongside French, German and other talent, via France&#x27;s TV show &quot;New Catch&quot; which originally debuted on French terrestrial channel TF1 in 1988 before being transplanted to satellite channel Eurosport upon its early 1989 launch, where it would continue into the early 1990s. All Star&#x27;s post-television boom wore off after 1993 when Nagasaki retired for a second time. However, the promotion kept afloat on live shows at certain established venues and particularly on the holiday camp circuit and remains active right up to the present.
Meanwhile, the WWF continued on Sky television, while its chief rival back home in America, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) made the jump from late-night ITV to British Wrestling&#x27;s old Saturday afternoon ITV timeslot, where it stayed until moving to Super Channel at the end of 1995 and then Channel 5 on Friday evenings from mid-1999 until WCW&#x27;s demise in 2001. Both major 1990s US promotions made several arena tours of the UK while the WWF held the pay-per-view event SummerSlam 1992 in London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium before a crowd of around 80,000.

===1990s–2000s: &quot;Old school&quot; and &quot;New school&quot;===

Following the demise of Joint Promotions and the slowdown at All Star, several of British wrestling&#x27;s old mainstay attractions chose to retire, while many younger stars such as Steve Regal and Dave Taylor as well as veterans like Finlay and Haystacks emigrated to the United States to continue their careers. Nevertheless, several Independent promoters attempted to capture what remained of the domestic market. Some, such as All Star, Steve Barker&#x27;s Rumble Wrestling (active 1984-2001 and 2019-present) John Freemantle&#x27;s Premier Promotions (active 1987-present), and Scott Conway&#x27;s The Wrestling Alliance (TWA, active 1989-2003), continued to preserve the traditional British wrestling style while many newly created promotions rejected the Mountevans rules and technical style of wrestling entirely in favour of the American variant. Features such as timed rounds and multiple falls were dropped in favour of American &quot;one fall to a finish&quot; matches. 

Conditions in the British scene would remain at a low ebb (with some smaller promoters resorting to &quot;WWF tribute&quot; shows) until the early-2000s, when a new generation of domestic stars would emerge, amongst them Doug Williams and Nigel McGuinness, who would split their time between performing in the United Kingdom and appearing for American promotions such as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). For example, TNA&#x27;s &quot;2004 X Cup&quot; featured All Star Wrestling wrestlers James Mason, Dean Allmark, Robbie Dynamite and Frankie Sloan as Team Britain while McGuinness would become highly prominent in Ring of Honor (ROH), first as their ROH Pure Champion in 2005 before becoming their ROH World Champion in 2007. In addition to British stars increasingly performing in the US, likewise, this period saw the increasing use of American stars on British shows. There was also an increasing degree of crossover between the traditional &quot;Old School&quot; and Americanised &quot;New School&quot; promotions after one of the latter, Frontier Wrestling Alliance featured an invasion storyline featuring traditional veterans from the former faction.

New promotions such as One Pro Wrestling and the FWA commonly featured a mixture of British and American performers, beginning a trend that would continue for the decades to come. By the early 2010s, wrestling stars such as PAC, Britani Knight, and Martin Stone continued to gravitate towards immigrating to the United States, however not before having spent several years performing in the UK first. Digital TV channel The Wrestling Channel, later rebranded The Fight Network, ran for five years in the United Kingdom combining worldwide wrestling programming with coverage of selected current British promotions as well as extensive rescreenings of vintage 1970s/1980s ITV footage (branded as &quot;World of Sport&quot; after the segment&#x27;s parent show), exposing the history of British wrestling to a new younger audience. After the channel&#x27;s 2008 closure, the repeats continued on other stations such as Men and Movies. Much of this footage, as well as original ITV broadcasts of matches, has since been uploaded to YouTube, further expanding classic British wrestling&#x27;s outreach to international wrestling fandom

===2010s: Attempts to return to ITV and WWE&#x27;s NXT UK===

The mid 2010s saw an increasing drive to return British Wrestling to ITV. A pilot for &quot;World of Sport Wrestling&quot; (branding itself as a direct revival of the old slot on the &quot;World Of Sport&quot; programme) was filmed at the Fairfield Halls, Croydon in 2013, however it was not picked up by ITV. Another attempt was given an airing by ITV on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2016. A follow-up series of 10 episodes was due to be filmed at Preston Guild Hall in May 2017 but this was postponed until a year later. Around this time, WWE also took an active interest in the local UK wrestling circuit, organising a WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament in Blackpool in January 2017, which crowned the inaugural WWE United Kingdom Champion. Several professional wrestling journalists reported that the WWE&#x27;s renewed interest in the region was to prevent the &quot;World of Sport Wrestling&quot; programme from succeeding. 

The &quot;World Of Sport Wrestling&quot; TV revival resumed production in May 2018 and was broadcast on ITV between 28 July and 29 September 2018. In July 2018 WWE announced that they would be launching NXT UK, a new development promotion to be based directly in the UK. Ultimately, the attempted revival would flounder and in 2019 a frustrated ITV moved on from the project, opting instead to begin airing programming from the newly created American promotion All Elite Wrestling. On 1 September 2022 the final episode of NXT UK aired, with WWE folding the entire NXT UK project. 

The 2010s were also characterised by increasing cooperation between British promotions such as Progress Wrestling and RevPro with Japanese promotions such as New Japan Pro Wrestling. Through these partnerships, professional wrestlers such as Zack Sabre Jr and Will Ospreay were able to split their time between performing in the UK and Japan, helping to develop their prominence in both countries.

===2020s===
As the American professional wrestling market became more competitive following the creation of All Elite Wrestling in 2019, this resulted in American companies taking a renewed interest in directly securing the British market. In 2020, at WrestleMania 36, Scotland&#x27;s Drew McIntyre became the first British wrestler to win the WWE Championship and in 2022, McIntyre headlined WWE Clash at the Castle, which took place in front of 62,296 paid attendees in Cardiff, Wales. The next year saw All Elite Wrestling hold AEW All In 2023 in Wembley Stadium, London, England before 72,265 paid attendees. Excluding SummerSlam 1992, these were the largest professional wrestling events to ever be held in the UK.

==Nations of the United Kingdom==
===Wales===
Wales had a strong foothold in British Wrestling, dominated by Orig Williams from the mid/late 1960s onward up to the 21st century. Williams&#x27; British Wrestling Federation produced Welsh-language television wrestling programmes for the bilingual S4C channel in the 1980s and 1990s under the title &quot;Reslo&quot;. One compilation from the early 1990s was released on VHS (in English) as &quot;Wrestling Madness&quot;. As with old ITV footage on the Wrestling Channel and elsewhere, copious old &quot;Reslo&quot; footage has also been repeated on S4C Digidol and uploaded to Youtube. Since Williams&#x27; death in November 2009, he was succeeded by Alan Ravenhill, who operates Welsh Wrestling. Other promotions in Wales include Attack! Pro Wrestling, Britannia Pro Wrestling (BWP), FUSION Pro Wrestling, Slammasters Wrestling, Basix, Pro Wrestling Karnage, Exist, Exposure Wrestling, and Creation Pro.

===Scotland===
Scotland was represented as part of Joint Promotions by Relwyskow Promotions, run by the family of George de Relwyskow. Relwyskow Promotions was not included in the buyouts of Joint Promotions in the 1960s-1980s and remained under its original management while continuing to receive a proportion of Joint Promotions&#x27; TV coverage. It remained active until the retirement of Ann Relwyskow in 1994. In 1990 and again in 1993, television tapings were held in Scotland and matches screened on Grampian Television and STV. During the 1960s, World Lightweight champion George Kidd was a successful television broadcaster, hosting his own chat show in Scotland&#x27;s ITV regions.

===Northern Ireland (and Republic of Ireland)===
The dominant promoter in Northern Ireland in the 1960s/1970s was former Irish national Olympic coach David &quot;Fit&quot; Finlay Senior who promoted wrestling on both sides of the border and trained such stars as his son Dave Finlay, Eddie Hammill and Sean &quot;Rasputin&quot; Doyle. Due to The Troubles, in the 1970s and 1980s these wrestlers and others would migrate to mainland Britain and find success there (in Hamill&#x27;s case, under a mask, billed as Kung Fu.) The younger Finlay would become a multiple champion and later succeed in America. Although RTÉ never had a wrestling show of its own, in the mid-1980s, a major championship match between Mighty John Quinn and Haystacks in Claremorris was publicised with a contract signing ceremony on Derek Davis&#x27; &quot;Davis at Large&quot; show. Later in the 1980s and 1990s, transmissions of Williams&#x27; &quot;Reslo&quot; programme on S4C could be received in much of the southern and eastern Republic of Ireland and Williams organised several tours of Ireland with his show&#x27;s roster during this time. In the 21st century, the dominant promotion in Ireland had been Irish Whip Wrestling before being replaced in popularity by Over The Top Wrestling.

<text>A World Lit Only by Fire: The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance: Portrait of an Age is an informal history of the European Middle Ages by American historian William Manchester. Published in 1992, the book is divided into three sections: &quot;The Medieval Mind&quot;, &quot;The Shattering&quot;, and &quot;One Man Alone&quot;. In the book, Manchester scathingly posits, as the title suggests, that the Middle Ages were ten centuries of technological stagnation, short-sightedness, bloodshed, feudalism, and an oppressive Church wedged between the golden ages of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance.

==Contents==
In the book&#x27;s &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot;, Manchester says, &quot;It is, after all, a slight work, with no scholarly pretensions. All the sources are secondary, and few are new; I have not mastered recent scholarship on the early sixteenth century.&quot;

&quot;The Medieval Mind&quot; extensively covers notable occurrences centered in approximately the year 500, including a description of the fall of the Roman Empire. The book further delineates the Dark Ages that immediately followed the collapse of the Roman Empire, including details regarding a number of adverse events that were characteristic of what Manchester regards as a &quot;stark&quot; era. It includes commentary on St. Augustine and the effects he had on medieval civilization. It talks about the overall ignorance of the masses during this time period.

The second section of the book, &quot;The Shattering&quot;, is the book&#x27;s longest section, expanding upon a number of events that Manchester regards as embodying the end of the Middle Ages as well as the early period of the Renaissance. It relates extensive anecdotes regarding a pope from the formidable medieval Borgia family, Pope Alexander VI, focusing on his &quot;wild&quot; celebrations and extensive nepotism, contrasted with a narrative centered around Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. Continuing with his focus in regard to spirituality, Manchester writes on the rise of humanism in the early Renaissance days and its celebration of secularism over piety. The section further covers humanist scholars, and concentrates upon the humanist tendencies of Renaissance leaders such as Michelangelo and Leonardo. The European nobility of the era are also touched upon in chapters elaborately describing the life and decisions made by England&#x27;s King Henry VIII. Henry&#x27;s wives and eventual separation from the Church despite his being once an &quot;ardent Catholic&quot; are treated extensively.

The final section of the work, &quot;One Man Alone&quot;, is a description of the voyage of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who circumnavigated the globe. The section expands upon the life and personality of Magellan and his eventual death in the Philippines in an attempt to convert the natives to Catholicism there. Manchester&#x27;s argument is ultimately that Magellan&#x27;s voyage was concurrent with and, on several levels, symptomatic of changing ways in which Renaissance people thought.

==Reception==
&quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and was praised for its lively storytelling in some journalistic reviews. Ron Grossman of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, for instance, wrote that &quot;by taking readers along on Magellan&#x27;s voyage, Manchester provides them with easy access to a fascinating age when our modern mentality was just being born.&quot; 

Some professional historians, however, have dismissed or ignored the book because of accusations regarding numerous factual errors and its dependence on interpretations that largely fell out of favor by the 1930s. In a review for &quot;Speculum&quot;, the journal of the Medieval Academy of America, Jeremy duQuesnay Adams remarked that Manchester’s work contained &quot;some of the most gratuitous errors of fact and eccentricities of judgment this reviewer has read (or heard) in quite some time.&quot; In particular, Adams pointed out that Manchester&#x27;s claims about diet, clothing, and medieval people&#x27;s views of time and their sense of self all ran counter to the conclusions of 20th-century historians of the Middle Ages. Manchester’s views on the transition from medieval to modern civilization, though they were popular in the 19th and early 20th century (and still are current in some segments of contemporary culture), have long been rejected by professional scholars in the relevant fields. Despite this, the book is often taught at the beginning of College Board&#x27;s AP European History class.

In 2014, the English industrial metal band Godflesh released an album named after Manchester&#x27;s book. Frontman Justin Broadrick found the brutality and bleakness of &quot;A World Lit Only by Fire&quot; inspiring.

In 2016, the book was chosen by Tom Hanks as the book he would take with him when castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

The book was also featured in a season 3 episode of &quot;Billy on the Street&quot;. Billy believed the book was written by 2 Chainz.

<text>The genus Eudyptula (&quot;good little diver&quot;) contains two species of penguin, found in southern Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand (including the Chatham Islands). They are commonly known as the little penguin, little blue penguin, or, in Australia, fairy penguin. In the language of the Māori people of New Zealand, little penguins are known as .

For many years, a white-flippered form of the little penguin found only in North Canterbury, New Zealand was considered either a separate species, &quot;Eudyptula albosignata&quot;, or just a subspecies, &quot;Eudyptula minor albosignata&quot;. Analysis of mtDNA revealed that &quot;Eudyptula&quot; falls instead into two groups: a western one, found along the southern coast of Australia and the Otago region of New Zealand, and another found in the rest of New Zealand. These two groups are now considered full species: &quot;Eudyptula novaehollandiae&quot; in Australia and Otago, and &quot;Eudyptula minor&quot; elsewhere. &quot;E. novaehollandiae&quot; probably arrived in New Zealand from Australia less than 500 years ago, following the local extinction of &quot;E. minor&quot; in Otago.

<text>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), sometimes called &quot;chorionic &quot;villous&quot; sampling&quot; (as &quot;villous&quot; is the adjectival form of the word &quot;villus&quot;), is a form of prenatal diagnosis done to determine chromosomal or genetic disorders in the fetus. It entails sampling of the chorionic villus (placental tissue) and testing it for chromosomal abnormalities, usually with FISH or PCR. CVS usually takes place at 10–12 weeks&#x27; gestation, earlier than amniocentesis or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling. It is the preferred technique before 15 weeks.

CVS was performed for the first time in Milan by Italian biologist Giuseppe Simoni, scientific director of Biocell Center, in 1983.
Use as early as eight weeks in special circumstances has been described. It can be performed in a transcervical or transabdominal manner. Although this procedure is mostly associated with testing for Down syndrome, overall, CVS can detect more than 200 disorders.

==Indications==
Possible reasons for having a CVS can include:
*Abnormal first trimester screen results
*Increased nuchal translucency or other abnormal ultrasound findings
*Family history of a chromosomal abnormality or other genetic disorder
*Parents are known carriers for a genetic disorder
* Advanced maternal age (maternal age above 35). AMA is associated with increase risk of Down&#x27;s syndrome and at age 35, risk is 1:400. Screening tests are usually carried out first before deciding if CVS should be done.

==Risks==
The risk of miscarriage in CVS is estimated to be potentially as high as 1–2%. However some recent research has suggested that only a very small number of miscarriages that occur after CVS are a direct result of the procedure. Apart from a risk of miscarriage, there is a risk of infection and amniotic fluid leakage. The resulting amniotic fluid leak can develop into a condition known as oligohydramnios, which is low amniotic fluid level. If the resulting oligohydramnios is not treated and the amniotic fluid continues to leak it can result in the baby developing hypoplastic lungs (underdeveloped lungs).

Additionally, there is also mild risk of limb reduction defects associated with CVS, with the risk being higher the earlier the procedure is carried.

It is important after having CVS that the obstetrician follows the patient closely to ensure the patient does not develop infection.

==Chorionic villi and stem cells==
Recent studies have discovered that chorionic villi can be a rich source of fetal stem cells, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells.

A potential benefit of using fetal stem cells over those obtained from embryos is that they side-step ethical concerns among anti-abortion activists by obtaining pluripotent lines of undifferentiated cells without harm to a fetus or destruction of an embryo. These stem cells would also, if used to treat the same individual they came from, sidestep the donor/recipient issue which has so far stymied all attempts to use donor-derived stem cells in therapies.

Artificial heart valves, working tracheas, as well as muscle, fat, bone, heart, neural and liver cells have all been engineered through use of fetal stem cells.

The first fetal stem cells bank in US is active in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Limitations==
A small percentage (1-2%) of pregnancies have confined placental mosaicism, where some but not all of the placental cells tested in the CVS are abnormal, even though the pregnancy is unaffected. Cells from the mother can be mixed with the placental cells obtained from the CVS procedure. Occasionally if these maternal cells are not completely separated from the placental sample, this can lead to discrepancies with the results. This phenomenon is called Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC). CVS cannot detect all birth defects. It is used for testing chromosomal abnormalities or other specific genetic disorders only if there is family history or other reason to test.

<text>A rifle grenade is a grenade that uses a rifle-based launcher to permit a longer effective range than would be possible if the grenade were thrown by hand.

The practice of projecting grenades with rifle-mounted launchers was first widely used during World War I and World War II and continues to the present, with the term &quot;rifle grenade&quot; now encompassing many different types of payloads including high explosive, fragmentation, anti-tank warheads, concussion, smoke, incendiary, and flare missiles.

Rifle grenades have largely been supplanted in the infantry fire support role by a combination of grenade launchers (typically affixed to rifles) and disposable anti-armor rockets.

== History ==

=== Early use ===
Adaptation of grenades for use in rifles began around the 18th century, when cup-shaped dischargers were fitted to the barrels of flintlock muskets, with the grenades propelled by the force of a blank cartridge. During the early 20th century a Japanese Colonel Amazawa experimented with rifle fired grenades during the Battle of Port Arthur in the Russo-Japanese War, and the idea was further used by the Spanish, though the French were the first to put it to widespread use during the trench warfare of World War I.

=== World War I ===
In 1908, Frederick Marten Hale patented the rod grenade. &quot;A simple rod was attached to a specialized grenade, inserted into the barrel of a standard service rifle and launched using a blank cartridge.&quot; The British did not immediately adopt the idea and entered World War I without any rifle grenades. However, as soon as the trench warfare started, there was a sudden need for rifle grenades. The British government purchased a rodded variant of the No 2 grenade as a temporary solution.

By 1915, Hales had developed the No 3, which is commonly known as the Hales rifle grenade. The Hales grenade was improved throughout World War I to make it more reliable and easier to manufacture. However, production of the grenade was slow. In order to speed rod grenades to the front, the British also made rodded versions of the Mills bomb.

Although a simple approach, launching a rod grenade &quot;...placed an extreme amount of stress on the rifle barrel and the rifle itself, resulting in the need to dedicate specific rifles to the grenade launching role, as they quickly became useless as an accurate firearm. This led to the search for an alternative and resulted in the reappearance of the cup launcher during the latter years of World War I&quot;. After World War I, the rod-type rifle grenade was declared obsolete and the remaining Hales were replaced with gas check equipped Mills Bombs shot from a rifle via a cup launcher.

The French grenade, named the &quot;V-B&quot; grenade after its inventors, Viven and Bessières, was fired from the standard service rifle with the use of a special adapter and a standard cartridge, providing an effective range of around . The grenade had a hollow through the middle, allowing the bullet to pass through, while the muzzle blast was captured by the launching device and used to propel the grenade. The bullet, after passing through the body of the grenade, struck a small plate that ignited the primer. This then lit the fuse in the grenade, providing an eight-second delay before detonation. It could be fired from the shoulder, but due to the heavy recoil and poor balance of the rifle fitted with the grenade, it was more common to fire it with the butt of the rifle resting on the ground, and either held at an appropriate angle, or resting on a tripod. The rifle grenade was useful in offense, particularly in attacking sandbag fortified machine gun nests, as well as in defense. Eight men armed with rifle grenades could fire 150 shots in a minute, providing a heavy barrage to break up an attacker&#x27;s lines.

Upon entering World War I, the United States attempted to adopt the V-B grenade, but this was not very successful. The difference in bore diameter between the French and American service cartridges ( vs. ) meant that the grenade had to be re-designed with a smaller hole, but even this was not sufficient to ensure reliable functioning, due to differences in bullet design. The American bullet would often break apart in the grenade, and this led to the V-B derived grenade design being scrapped in May 1918.

The next United States attempt at a rifle grenade was to return to and develop an improved rod-grenade. The Babbitt grenade, developed by Colonel E. B. Babbitt of the U.S. Ordnance Department, used a long stem projecting from the rear of the grenade, which was slipped into the barrel of the Springfield 1903 rifle, and propelled with a special blank cartridge. The stem was calibrated with a number of grooves and a split ring, which allowed the user to set the grenade to slide a certain distance into the muzzle of the rifle. When the stem was inserted only part way, the chamber pressure upon firing was reduced, propelling the grenade a shorter distance. When fired at a 45-degree angle, ranges from were possible; with the rifle angled at 80 degrees, ranges as short as were possible. In addition to providing the force to propel the grenade, the gases from firing were directed through a hollow in the stem, and provided force to arm the grenade. Once armed, the grenade had a heavy plunger that would detonate the grenade upon impact.

=== World War II ===
After World War I, the rifle grenade was steadily modified to increase its effectiveness when launched from a rifle.

In 1928, the Italian Army adopted an unusual cup-type rifle grenade launcher bolted to the side of a normal Carcano 6.5 mm carbine, the &quot;Moschetto di Fanteria Mod. 91/28 con Tromboncino&quot;. In use, the rifle&#x27;s bolt was removed and installed in the launcher chamber. The rifle was placed butt-first against the ground, a grenade loaded down the launcher&#x27;s muzzle and standard rifle round loaded into the grenade launcher&#x27;s chamber. When fired, the bullet was trapped, the neck of the cartridge case expanded and the gases passed into launcher&#x27;s barrel through four holes providing the energy needed to launch the grenade. After the grenade was launched, the chamber was opened, ejecting the spent cartridge case and making the bullet fall out. The necessity of changing the rifle bolt kept the rifle out of use until the bolt could be replaced, a slow and clumsy procedure. The bolt-changing procedure could also result in lost rifle bolts in the heat of battle, putting the weapon out of action completely. As a result, this design was not adopted by any other nation. Today, it can be seen as an early, if unsuccessful ancestor of modern under-barrel grenade launchers such as the M203.





The Japanese military continued to experiment with rifle and hand-thrown grenades between the wars and would adopt a family of fragmentation grenades with almost universal adaptability. Introduced in 1931, the Type 91 fragmentation grenade could be thrown by hand, fired from a cup-type grenade launcher (the Type 100), discharged by a lightweight mortar-like projector (the Type 89 grenade discharger, or &quot;knee mortar&quot;). or fitted with tail-fin assembly and fired from a spigot-type rifle grenade launcher.

The spigot-type grenade launchers were used by Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces to launch an anti-tank (hollow-charge) finned grenade. They were also used to propel Type 91 hand grenades fitted with tail-fin assemblies. These grenades had wood-bulleted launching cartridges stored in their tail-fin assemblies. The cartridges are fired from the rifle and the wooden bullets are trapped by the tail-fin assemblies launching and arming the grenades. These launchers are not numbered, and production figures are not available and examples of spigot grenade launchers are rarely encountered.

In 1939, the Japanese introduced the Type 89 grenade discharger, the Type 91 fragmentation grenade was fitted with a propellant base and time fuse. It did not explode upon contact, but was designed to ignite its fuse while in flight. A weak creep spring inside the grenade firing mechanism allowed the firing pin to be thrown back upon launching, igniting a time fuse with a 7-8 second delay. Using this system, the Type 91 grenades could be launched through jungle cover or through small openings without the danger of premature detonation in the event the grenade struck an object on its way to the target. Although the Type 89 could be fired by a single person, it was typically operated with a crew of 3, enabling it to reach a rate of fire of about 25 rounds per minute.

In 1939, the Japanese also introduced the Type 100 grenade discharger for the Type 38 and Type 99 Arisaka rifles. It launches standard Type 91 and Type 99 hand-grenades. The launcher is somewhat unusual in that rather than using the more common cup designs it is a gas trap system, meaning that it incorporates a barrel extension which taps off excess propellant gases to launch the grenade from a cup offset from the barrel. This has the advantage that standard rifle cartridges could be used along with the standard hand-grenades which simplified logistics, at the expense of increased weight and decreased efficiency. The effective range is approximately .

In 1940, Britain put the first anti-tank grenade into the field during World War II the No. 68 AT grenade, which was one of the first &quot;of any&quot; type anti-tank weapons with a shaped charge or high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) type warhead. The design of the warhead was simple and could penetrate of armor in 1940. The simple fins gave it some stability in the air and detonation occurred on impact.

In 1942, an attachable rifle grenade launcher called the Gewehrgranatengerät or Schiessbecher (&#x27;shooting cup&#x27;) was introduced that was developed based on rifle grenade launcher models designed during World War I. The Schiessbecher cup-type rifle grenade launcher could be mounted on any Karabiner 98k and was intended to replace all previous rifle grenade launcher models. The rifle grenade launcher could be used against infantry, fortifications and light armored vehicles up to a range of 280 m (306 yd). For these differing tasks, several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for the 1,450,113 produced Schiessbecher rifle grenade launchers. The rifle grenade-propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to the rifle grenade that, upon impact, automatically primed the rifle grenade. The Schiessbecher could be mounted on the Karabiner 98a, G98/40, StG 44, and FG 42

The Japanese would also adopt a version of the German Schiessbecher grenade launcher. The Type 2 rifle grenade launcher was an attachment for the Type 38 and Type 99 rifles that allowed them to fire special hollow charge grenades. Two grenades were produced for the launcher: a grenade and a larger, grenade, both designated Type 2. The launcher sits over the end of the barrel, held in place with a clamping device. A special crimped blank cartridge or wooden bullet is used to fire the grenades.

In the years just before World War II, the United States adopted the spigot-type 22 mm rifle grenade launchers. These launchers are attached to a rifles muzzle, in the form of a detachable adapter. As with most rifle grenades, it is propelled by a blank cartridge inserted into the chamber of the rifle. A grenade can range from powerful anti-tank rounds such as the M9 rifle grenade, to simple finned tubes with a fragmentation hand grenade attached to the end such as the M1 grenade adapter. The &quot;&quot; refers to the diameter of the base tube which fits over the spigot of the launcher, not the diameter of the warhead section, which is much wider.

=== Modern use ===
After World War II, many countries adopted spigot-type launchers and anti-tank rifle grenades with shaped charge or high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads. The Belgian ENERGA anti-tank rifle grenade design in particular was widely adopted by Western nations. These post-war designs come in &quot;standard&quot; type which are propelled by a blank cartridge inserted into the chamber of the rifle. And, the newer &quot;bullet trap&quot; and &quot;shoot through&quot; types, as their names imply use live ammunition.

The M31 HEAT rifle grenade is a fin-stabilized anti-tank rifle grenade designed in the late 1950s to replace the Belgian ENERGA rifle grenade which was adopted by the US Army and US Marines as an emergency stop-gap measure during the Korean War. Compared to the ENERGA, the M31 is slightly lighter in weight and has a smaller-diameter warhead—i.e. vs . Penetration for the M31 is estimated to be &quot;&quot; for steel armor plating and twice that estimate for concrete.

The bullet-trap rifle grenade became increasing popular in the post-war years, most notably the French AC58 anti-armor and APAV40 multi-purpose grenades. The rifle grenade launchers were further simplified, becoming an integral part of the rifle itself. All current NATO rifles are capable of launching STANAG rifle grenades from their flash hiders without the use of an adapter.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, rifle grenades and their launchers were slowly replaced by disposable single shot rocket launchers such as the M72 LAW (light anti-tank weapon), and dedicated 40 mm grenade launchers. First seen in the United States armed forces, these 40 mm grenade launchers generally took the form of separate weapons, such as the M79 grenade launcher. Or, as an under-barrel attachment to an assault rifle, such as the M203 grenade launcher attached to an M16 rifle.

Today, there is a return to the concept of the rifle grenade, such as the SIMON breach grenade, the IMI Refaim, FN Herstal Telgren and the Japanese Type 06 advance grenades. These grenades were designed to be used by ordinary riflemen as opposed to specially trained grenadiers. For example, the MECAR rifle grenades are equipped with simple ballistic sights and have an effective range of .

Modern combined arms doctrine dictates that every infantry unit should have a certain percentage of dedicated grenadiers, or soldiers equipped with a grenade launcher or combination rifle/grenade launcher. The criticism of this doctrine is that if the grenadiers in a group are disabled or separated from the group, then the group has completely lost the grenade launcher as a heavy fire support. With the addition of rifle grenades, each soldier would be equipped with a small number of rifle grenades, so every individual soldier could have some form of heavy firepower. However, all of these rifle grenades add additional weight to the soldiers&#x27; war-load, and as a consequence they must reduce the amount of rifle ammunition that they carry. For example, a modern French AC58 &quot;bullet trap&quot; rifle grenade weighs , the equivalent of a loaded M16 STANAG magazine.

The AK-47 can mount the Kalashnikov cup-type grenade-launcher that uses standard Soviet RGD-5 hand-grenades. The soup-can shaped launcher is screwed onto an AK-47&#x27;s muzzle. The maximum effective range is approximately . The M16 has a similar device used to launch tear-gas hand-grenades.

On 10 April 2021, during 2021 Myanmar protests, security forces killed at least 82 protesters in Bago town with rifle grenades.

=== Comparison of performance ===
== Designs ==

=== Rod-type ===
The rod-type rifle grenade is a standard hand grenade with a metallic rod attached to the base. They were developed before World War I. To use:

# Insert the rod-type rifle grenade down the barrel of a standard rifle
# Insert a special blank cartridge into the rifle&#x27;s chamber
# Place the rifle&#x27;s butt-stock on the ground
# While holding the grenade&#x27;s safety spoon with one hand, remove the safety pin with the other
# Place free hand on the rifle&#x27;s grip and prepare to fire
# Release the grenade&#x27;s safety spoon, quickly place said hand on the rifle&#x27;s fore stock and immediately fire the rifle

If the soldier does not immediately launch the grenade, it will time out and explode. It was later found that the repeated launching of rod grenades caused damage to a rifle&#x27;s barrel and the rod-type rifle grenade fell from favor.

=== Cup-type ===
The cup-type launcher replaced the rod-type rifle grenade during World War I. This soup-can shaped launcher is attached to a rifle&#x27;s muzzle. The cup-type launcher could launch a standard hand-grenade or a purpose built cup-type grenade. To use:

# Insert a grenade into the cup launcher. When using a standard hand-grenade remove the safety pin, the cup holds the safety-spoon in place until launched
# Insert a special blank cartridge into the rifle&#x27;s chamber
# Place the butt-stock of the rifle on the ground and fire from this position

=== &quot;Shoot-through&quot; type ===
The cup-type launcher has the advantage of using standard hand-grenades. However, the need to load a blank cartridge into the rifle&#x27;s chamber in order to launch the grenade proved to be clumsy in combat. This difficulty lead to the development the French &quot;Vivien and Bessières&quot; shoot-through grenade (or VB grenade). As the name implies, these grenades allow for the use of standard ball ammunition. The VB grenade has a hole through the middle that permits the passage of a standard bullet; this arms the grenade, the expanding gasses launch the grenade, and the grenade explodes 8 seconds later. This removes the need to provide a special blank round to launch the grenade. To use:

# Insert VB grenade into the cup-type launcher
# Place the butt-stock of the rifle on the ground and fire from this position

=== Spigot-type ===
The 22mm type rifle grenade launcher was developed before World War II. This type of launcher is attached to a rifle&#x27;s muzzle and allows for the use of a wide range of rifle grenades, from powerful anti-tank rounds to simple finned tubes with a fragmentation hand-grenade attached to the end. These rifle grenades come in &quot;standard&quot; type, which are propelled by a blank cartridge inserted into the chamber of the rifle; or, &quot;bullet trap&quot; and &quot;shoot through&quot; types, which allow the use of live ammunition. All modern 22mm rifle grenades explode on impact. All Standard issue NATO rifles are capable of launching STANAG type 22mm rifle grenades from their integral flash hiders without the use of an adapter. Modern bullet-trap rifle grenades such as the French APAV40 can be fired as fast as a soldier can place a grenade on an FAMAS rifle&#x27;s muzzle and pull the trigger. To use:

# Place 22mm rifle grenade over the spigot attachment or the rifle&#x27;s flash hider
# Aim at target and fire rifle

== Other uses and similar devices ==


During the Second World War, Nazi Germany developed and fielded a propaganda rifle grenade (Propaganda-Gewehrgranate). It was designed for front-line troops to disperse propaganda leaflets via a rifle grenade that would disperse the printed material via a small ejecting charge.

The advent of less lethal grenades for riot control has led to the creation of gun launched versions of these grenades, though they are typically launched by riot shotguns, not rifles. These systems use a cup-type launcher attached to the muzzle of the gun to launch various less lethal grenade types.

A &quot;golf ball launcher&quot; is a cup-type launcher which is used for sport or recreational purposes. These launchers will shoot a standard golf ball over with little to no recoil. These launchers are designed to replace an AR-15 type rifle&#x27;s flash hider.

There&#x27;s also a soda/beer can launcher. Unlike the golf ball launcher that screws onto the end of the barrel, where the AR-15 family of rifles&#x27; flash hider attaches, the can launcher tube is fitted directly to the AR-15 upper receiver and is the entire barrel assembly. Both the golf ball launcher and can launcher require the use of blank ammunition.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Compared to a standard hand-grenade, a rifle grenade:
* Can be projected to a much greater distance
* Can carry a larger, heavier payload
* Can effectively project a shaped charge warhead which can penetrate armor
* Has the advantage of detonating upon impact
* Is more accurate

However, a rifle grenade:
* Requires a rifle to launch
* Is more complicated to use than a hand grenade.
* Is larger and heavier than a hand grenade.
* Produces very high levels of recoil when launched from a rifle.

Compared to a dedicated grenade launcher, a rifle grenade:
* Can be of a variety of different sizes and shapes of warheads and payloads
* Can be projected from any rifle fitted with an appropriate muzzle base or spigot tube fitting; in essence, every soldier armed with a rifle can be a grenadier
* Can fire up to 10 grenades per minute for area suppression, for a modern bullet-trap rifle grenade
* Requires a simple, smaller, and cheaper launcher attachment (or even no attachment at all) when compared to a standalone grenade launcher

However:
* A rifle grenade will temporarily disable the normal use of the rifle
* A dedicated grenade launcher can be fired from the shoulder without undue discomfort, something not normally possible with a rifle grenade
* A soldier armed with a dedicated grenade launcher can carry 2 to 3 times more grenade ammo than rifle grenades
* A dedicated grenade launcher is more accurate than a rifle grenade

Compared to a rocket launcher, a rifle grenade:
* Has a curved trajectory, allowing indirect fire against targets in defilade, behind walls and buildings or rooftops
* Is much lighter and does not require the user to carry a bulky launcher tube
* Can be safely fired from inside a building whereas a Rocket Launcher cannot due to the danger of backblast

However:
* Rocket launchers have a flatter trajectory making them more accurate &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; weapons
* Rocket launchers generally have more powerful warheads
* Rocket launchers generally have a longer effective range

<text>Hilton Lee Smith (February 27, 1907 – November 18, 1983) was an American right-handed pitcher in Negro league baseball. He pitched alongside Satchel Paige for the Kansas City Monarchs and Bismarck Churchills between 1932 and 1948. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Early life==
Born in Giddings, Texas, Smith began his career in black baseball&#x27;s equivalent of the minor leagues with the Austin Black Senators in Austin, Texas. Smith made the dean&#x27;s list as a student at Prairie View A&amp;M College in 1928 and 1929. He was an outfielder in his first college season and a pitcher in his second year.

His big league debut was with the Monroe Monarchs of Monroe, Louisiana in 1932. In 1934, Smith wed Louise Humphrey. They had two children.

==Semi-pro career==
From 1935 to 1936, Smith pitched for the Bismarck semi-professional team organized by Neil Churchill. In 1935, his teammates included Satchel Paige, Ted &quot;Double Duty&quot; Radcliffe, Quincy Trouppe, Barney Morris, and Chet Brewer. In August, the team won the national semipro championship in Wichita, Kansas. In 1936, Paige, Radcliffe, and Brewer departed and Smith became the ace of the Bismarck team. They returned to the national championship, where Smith won four games, but Bismarck failed to repeat as champions.

==Negro league career==
In late 1936, Smith signed with the Kansas City Monarchs. From 1937 until his retirement in 1948, Smith was a star pitcher on the Monarchs. He possessed an outstanding curveball, but was overshadowed by his more flamboyant teammate Satchel Paige. Often Paige would pitch the first three innings of a game, leaving Smith to pitch the remaining six. Also, unlike Paige, Smith was a very good hitter. Smith led the Negro American League in wins three times (1937–38, 1941). He also led the NAL with strikoutes four times (1937–39, 1941). He was tied with Ray Brown as the second player in Negro league history to win the pitching Triple Crown, doing so in 1938 with 9 wins, 88 strikeouts, and a 1.92 ERA.

==Post-playing career and death==
After retiring from baseball, Smith worked as a schoolteacher and later as a steel plant foreman. He also scouted for the Chicago Cubs. Smith had a quiet, reserved temperament, but in his later years he stood up for Negro leaguers in their struggle to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He died in 1983 in Kansas City, Missouri. It was not until 2001 that he was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

<text>Riptide is an American detective television series that ran on NBC between January 3, 1984 and April 22, 1986, starring Perry King, Joe Penny, and Thom Bray.

The series was created by Frank Lupo and Stephen J. Cannell and was a joint production of Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with Columbia Pictures Television for NBC. The main theme was composed by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter. A midseason replacement, it debuted as a two-hour TV movie in early 1984. After its cancellation, reruns were aired on the USA Network during the late 1980s. The series currently appears occasionally on the schedules of getTV and Decades.

==Premise==
Cody Allen (Perry King) and Nick Ryder (Joe Penny) are two former Vietnam War Army buddies who decided to open the Pier 56 Detective Agency (later known as the Riptide Detective Agency) in Los Angeles, California. Realizing that computers and technology play a major role in many investigations, they recruit the help of Murray &quot;Boz&quot; Bozinsky (Thom Bray), a brilliant but nerdy scientist and computer hacker whom they met while serving in the Army.

The team operates out of Cody&#x27;s boat, the &quot;Riptide&quot;, moored at Pier 56 at King Harbor Marina in Redondo Beach. The men have several other tools in their fight against crime and injustice, including Murray&#x27;s robot, The Roboz (which, unlike most television robots, does not speak); Nick&#x27;s aging Sikorsky S-58T helicopter, &quot;The Screaming Mimi&quot;, which Nick occasionally used for his sideline business, aerial harbor tours; and Cody&#x27;s speedboat, the &quot;Ebb Tide&quot;. Nick also owns a classic red Chevrolet Corvette, and in early episodes, Cody drives an orange &quot;Woodie&quot; station wagon which is later replaced by a four-wheel drive custom GMC Jimmy.

Lt. Quinlan (Jack Ging) is a local police officer who continually harasses the trio. Lt. Parisi (June Chadwick), the agency&#x27;s police contact during the final episodes, is more cooperative. During the first few episodes, Mama Jo (Anne Francis) is the crusty skipper of the &quot;Barefoot Contessa&quot;, a tourist boat with an all-female crew. Introduced later in the first season is Max, a comedian at a local club. Second-season episodes also feature Dooley (Ken Olandt), a dock boy who occasionally assists the team in their escapades.

The show&#x27;s penultimate episode, &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Beat &#x27;Em, Join &#x27;Em&quot;, shows Cody and Nick acting as consultants to Rosalind Grant (Annette McCarthy) and Cary Russell (H. Richard Greene), the bickering stars of a television detective show pilot that closely resembles and parodies &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;″s former primetime competition on Tuesday nights.

Although local mobsters were depicted in most episodes, some reflected sensitive topics, such as corruption within the U.S. Army, high-level cover-ups, and black operations by corporate America. The third season&#x27;s &quot;Home for Christmas&quot;, with a performance by James Whitmore, has a strongly emotional tone.

<doc id="697868" wikidata="Q845077" url="?curid=697868" title="Dead Calm (film)">
<text>Dead Calm is a 1989 Australian psychological thriller film directed by Phillip Noyce, produced by George Miller, and starring Sam Neill, Nicole Kidman and Billy Zane. The screenplay by Terry Hayes was based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Charles Williams.

Filmed around the Great Barrier Reef, the plot focuses on a married couple, who, after tragically losing their son, are spending some time isolated at sea, when they come across a stranger who has abandoned a sinking ship.

Notably, the movie is the first successful film adaptation of the novel, after Orson Welles worked for a number of years to complete his own film based on it titled &quot;The Deep&quot;, though it ultimately went unreleased and uncompleted. The 1993 Indian film Darr was inspired by Dead Calm. 

&quot;Dead Calm&quot; was generally well received, with critics praising Neill, Kidman, and Zane&#x27;s performances and the oceanic cinematography. It was nominated in eight categories at the 1989 Australian Film Institute Awards, including Best Film, and won four. Modern retrospective analyses have been favorable, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; naming it one of the 1000 best films ever made.

==Plot==
Rae Ingram is involved in a car crash which results in the death of her son. Her older husband, Royal Australian Navy officer Captain John Ingram, suggests that they help deal with their grief by heading out for a vacation alone on their yacht. In the middle of the Pacific, they encounter a drifting schooner that seems to be taking on water. A man, Hughie Warriner, rows over to the Ingrams&#x27; yacht for help. He claims that his ship is sinking and that his companions have all died of food poisoning.

Suspicious of Hughie&#x27;s story, John rows over to the other ship, instructing Rae to assemble and load the ship&#x27;s shotgun, though she ignores this. Inside, John discovers the mangled corpses of the other passengers and video footage indicating that Hughie may have murdered them in a feat of extraordinary violence. John rushes back to his own boat, but he&#x27;s too late as Hughie awakes, knocks out Rae and sails their yacht away, leaving John behind.

As John attempts to keep Hughie&#x27;s ship from sinking and catch up with them, Rae awakens and tries to convince Hughie to go back for her husband. Hughie denies her request and keeps on sailing, alternating between kindness and bouts of rage. John manages to get through to his wife on the radio, but the water damage makes him unable to reply save for clicks on his ship&#x27;s radio receiver. He can respond only yes or no to her questions. John assures her that he is following close by. Rae tries to stall the yacht by turning off the engine and tossing the keys overboard. Her dog jumps in to retrieve the keys and brings them back as he had done earlier with his fetch ball. Hughie starts the yacht back up and tries to convince Rae to be friends with him. Rae accepts, attempting to earn his trust. After a while, she goes back to the radar room to contact John. A blip appears on the edge of the radar&#x27;s range, signifying the damaged boat. She soon learns that it is too far gone and will sink in the next several hours. With John unable to come to her rescue, Rae assures her husband that she will come back for him. John&#x27;s radio shorts before Rae has a chance to tell him that she loves him. Unable to make further contact with him, Rae breaks down and cries.

Hughie comes down to see Rae sobbing, and heads over to soothe her. Rae formulates a plan to seduce Hughie and gain his trust long enough for her to get to the shotgun on deck. She and Hughie start to kiss and undress on the floor, before Rae stalls for time by telling him that she has to go to the bathroom. She runs on deck to assemble the shotgun, but Ben the dog follows her. Before she has a chance to load the gun, the dog starts barking causing Hughie to go investigate. In a panic, Rae leaves the gun behind and takes cigarettes down with her as an excuse for being on deck. She eases his suspicion by taking him to the bedroom where she buys herself more time by allowing Hughie to have sex with her. Later, she thinks about the betrayal of her husband and for having an orgasm. Rae fixes some lemonade, and places a heavy dose of her prescription sedatives into her drink after noticing the bottle on the counter, correctly anticipating she could trick Hughie into drinking it. Claiming to go get dressed, Rae heads back for the shotgun, and is discovered soon after. As a fierce storm approaches, Rae and Hughie come to blows. Hughie takes hold of the shotgun, but the effects of the sedative cause him to aim poorly and shoot the radio by mistake. Rae eventually takes hold of a harpoon gun and locks herself in the bedroom. As the door opens she fires off a harpoon. Seeing blood she pushes it open, only to discover she killed her dog. Hughie comes out of hiding to strangle her, but passes out from the drugs. Rae ties him up and sails back to rescue John. Hughie recovers consciousness and cuts himself free with a shard of broken mirror, but after making his way to Rae, she shoots him in the shoulder with a harpoon and knocks him unconscious. She then sets him adrift in the yacht&#x27;s life raft and continues to look for her husband.

Meanwhile, the damage and the storm have caused the schooner to sink almost completely. The storm intensifies and breaks the ship&#x27;s main mast, trapping John below deck. The water rises and eventually he is submerged over his head, able to breathe only through a piece of pipe leading to the deck. The only way he can go is down into the schooner&#x27;s hull, he notices a sizable fish indicating a significant hole. He takes one last breath from the pipe and dives. Through a gaping hole in the bottom of the hull, John emerges back on the surface. He sets the wreck on fire to signal his location to Rae, who is now desperate to find him. Dusk sets in as Rae notices the flames and sets course to the faint fire on the horizon. Without any means to signal his wife, all John can do is wait on a piece of floating debris. After night falls, the pair reunite when Rae arrives and pulls John aboard.

Later they find the life raft and Rae shoots it with a flare, setting it on fire. The next day they are relaxing on deck when John takes a break from washing Rae&#x27;s hair to prepare breakfast for her. Her eyes closed, Rae feels a pair of hands begin massaging her scalp and assumes it is John, but when she opens her eyes she sees a bloody Hughie, who begins to strangle her. While Rae struggles, John arrives from below deck. Seeing Rae being attacked, John shoots Hughie in the mouth with a flare, killing him instantly.

==Unfinished previous adaptation==

The film is based on the novel &quot;Dead Calm&quot; by American author Charles Williams. Orson Welles had optioned the film rights in the mid-1960&#x27;s. Under the title &quot;The Deep&quot;, Welles shot the film between 1966 and 1969 off the coast of Yugoslavia. The prospective film starred Laurence Harvey as Hughie, Michael Bryant as Ingram, Oja Kodar as Rae, and Welles himself played Russ Bellowes. Jeanne Moreau played Hughie&#x27;s wife Ruth, a character present in the original novel but cut out of Noyce&#x27;s film.

Welles&#x27; production was plagued by financial and technical problems, and effectively halted at the end of 1969. Principal photography remained incomplete, and Laurence Harvey&#x27;s death in 1973 effectively ended any hope of completing the film. The original film negative is considered lost, though two workprints survive, and footage from the film has been displayed since.

== Production ==
Producer Tony Bill had tried to buy the rights from Welles but was never successful. He mentioned this to Phil Noyce, giving him a copy of the book in 1984. Noyce enjoyed the book and showed it to George Miller and Terry Hayes, who were enthusiastic. Miller managed to persuade Oja Kodar, Welles&#x27;s companion, who controlled the rights to the novel, to sell the book to Kennedy Miller.

The book features several other main characters (including Hughie&#x27;s wife and survivors John finds on the Orpheus), and presented Hughie as a nominally asexual manchild. It also goes into further detail about what caused Hughie&#x27;s psychotic break.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot over a 6-month span in Queensland&#x27;s Whitsunday Islands beginning in May 1987. George Miller directed some sequences himself, including one where Sam Neill&#x27;s character is tormented in the boat by a shark. This scene ended up being dropped from the final film.

The sequence in which John kills Hughie with a flare was filmed at the request of Warner Bros seven months after principal photography finished. As written, the film originally ended with Rae setting Hughie adrift on a life raft to ostensibly die at sea; the studio was unhappy with this ambiguity and wanted a definite fate for the film&#x27;s antagonist.

Sam Neill met his future wife Noriko Watanabe during filming.

=== Music ===
The synthesizer-driven film score was composed and performed by New Zealand musician Graeme Revell, of the industrial group SPK. &quot;Dead Calm&quot; was Revell&#x27;s first ever film score, and earned him an AFI Award for Best Original Music Score.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Dead Calm&quot; grossed $2,444,407 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $4,253,268 in 2009 dollars. It grossed $7,825,009 in the U.S.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Dead Calm&quot; has an 84% &quot;fresh&quot; rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 reviews, with a rating of 7.5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states that &quot;Nicole Kidman&#x27;s coiled intensity and muscular direction by Phillip Noyce give this nautical thriller a disquieting sense of dread&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

According to David Stratton of &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;throughout the film, Nicole Kidman is excellent&quot; and &quot;she gives the character of Rae real tenacity and energy&quot; and &quot;though not always entirely credible&quot; the picture &quot;is a nail-biting suspense pic, handsomely produced and inventively directed.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;generates genuine tension.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film&#x27;s creators: &quot;Noyce&#x27;s direction moves impressively from sensual tenderness (between husband and wife) to edge-of-the-seat horror. With accomplished editing by Richard Francis-Bruce and scoring by Graeme Revell, he finds lurking dangers in quiet, peaceful waters.&quot;

On the other hand, Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the film was &quot;an unsettling hybrid of escapist suspense and the kind of pure trash that depends on dead babies and murdered dogs for effect,&quot; and that &quot;Dead Calm&quot; &quot;becomes disturbing for all the wrong reasons.&quot; A number of critics faulted the film&#x27;s ending as being over-the-top, with the &quot;Post&quot;″s Howe writing, &quot;... while it&#x27;s afloat, &#x27;Dead Calm&#x27; is a majestic horror cruise. ... For much of the movie, you&#x27;re enthralled. By the end, you&#x27;re laughing.&quot;

The acting was generally considered excellent, with Zane being cited for injecting &quot;unforgettable humanity and evil puckishness into his role&quot; and being &quot;suitably manic and evil.&quot; And while Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote &quot;what&#x27;s most fascinating about it is Rae&#x27;s place in the pantheon of heroines, an Amazon for the &#x27;90s,&quot; the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; James called Kidman&#x27;s character &quot;tough but stupid.&quot;

The film is listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Top 1000 Movies list, derived from editor Peter M. Nichols&#x27; &quot;The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Griffin, 2004). The film was partly the inspiration for 1993 Hindi-language film &quot;Darr&quot;.

<text>Johnny Donovan is an American radio announcer and former producer at New York&#x27;s WABC (AM).

He grew up in Poughkeepsie, New York, nicknamed &quot;Sarge,&quot; after his father&#x27;s rank in the United States Army during World War II. A radio enthusiast from an early age (with an amateur radio station K2KOQ in a corner of the basement), he became a DJ (&quot;Large Sarge&quot;) on WHVW in nearby Hyde Park, after helping build the station. He went on to stations in Kingston (WBAZ) and Binghamton (WENE), New York and Atlantic City, New Jersey (WMID) before landing in New York City, first at WOR-FM, and finally at WABC (at the time the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; for DJs), where he preceded Dan Ingram on the air.

Donovan stayed on at WABC as Production Director and chief staff announcer when WABC went to a talk format in 1982.

With the assistance of Peter Kanze, Rob Frankel and Allan Sniffen, he produced the now defunct WABC &quot;Rewound&quot; program each Memorial Day.

In May 2015 he retired from WABC after 43 years. He remained the &quot;voice&quot; of Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s syndicated show, for which WABC was the flagship station from 1988 until the end of 2013, since then airing on WOR.

<doc id="697872" wikidata="Q3734045" url="?curid=697872" title="Billy Bathgate">
<text>Billy Bathgate is a 1989 novel by author E. L. Doctorow that won the 1989 National Book Critics Circle award for fiction for 1990, the 1990 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, the 1990 William Dean Howells Medal, and was the runner-up for the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and the 1989 National Book Award. The book was dedicated to Jason Epstein.

A film based on the novel was released in 1991 to very mixed reviews.

==Plot summary==
Billy Behan is an impoverished fifteen-year-old living in The Bronx with his mother. One afternoon, Billy is present when infamous Jewish mobster Dutch Schultz arrives to inspect a shipment of illegal beer. When Billy demonstrates his skill at juggling, an amused Schultz calls him a &quot;capable boy&quot; and tips him. Billy later finds and infiltrates Schultz&#x27;s offices without being seen, resulting in Schultz&#x27;s accountant and trusted advisor Otto Berman agreeing to take him into the gang. To avoid the stigma of having an Irish boy work for a Jewish crime boss, Billy changes his last name to &quot;Bathgate&quot; after a local street.

When Berman tasks Billy to spy on the gangsters who go to Schultz&#x27;s nightclub, Billy witnesses Bo Weinberg, Schultz&#x27;s lieutenant, meeting with a pair of men affiliated with the rival Italian mafia. Believing that Weinberg is a traitor, Schultz has him and his girlfriend, a socialite named Drew Preston, kidnapped at gunpoint. Billy follows them out to a riverboat, where he witnesses Schultz having Weinberg thrown into the East River with his feet encased in cement. Afterwards, Schultz has Billy take Drew back to her apartment to gather her things. Billy discovers Drew is married, and that her wealthy husband, Harvey, is gay.

Seeing Schultz as simply the latest of her sexual conquests, Drew agrees to become his gun moll and is taken with him when he settles in Onondaga as part of his plan to avoid conviction for tax evasion. Billy poses as Schulz&#x27;s ward with Drew as his governess, while Schultz works to win over the locals by paying off debts, making charitable gifts, and even converting to Roman Catholicism at the town church. One afternoon, Drew goes for a country hike with Billy and asks him to tell her the truth about Bo&#x27;s death. She then scrambles down the side of a waterfall and swims in the pool underneath, where Billy comforts her. Eventually, the two start an affair.

On the day of the trial, Berman instructs Billy to take Drew to the horse races at Saratoga Springs. Billy quickly realizes that he&#x27;s been set up, and that Schultz has arranged for his best hitmen to kill Drew as he fears she will implicate him in Bo&#x27;s murder. Billy uses the allowance Berman provided him with to have flowers and expensive gifts delivered to Drew, making it impossible for her to be harmed without attracting attention. The ruse buys enough time for Harvey, whom Billy contacted beforehand, to pick up Drew and take her out of the country to safety. Billy, questioned as to why he bought the gifts, lies and says that he bought them on impulse without admitting his relationship with Drew. Schultz is acquitted, but his enemy, federal prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey, issues an arrest order for the mobster if he returns to New York. 

Schultz flees to Newark and sets up an office in the back room of a chophouse. Against Berman&#x27;s advice that going after Dewey would not sit well with the other gangs, Schultz decides to assassinate his enemy and orders Billy to case his apartment block. Just as Billy returns, Mafia gunmen storm the restaurant; Schultz, Berman, and their bodyguards are killed. Billy is small enough to escape out of a bathroom window and returns in time for the dying Berman to give Billy the code to Schultz&#x27;s personal safe. Billy sneaks into the hospital and notes down the delirious Schultz&#x27;s stream of consciousness monologue as he is dying, using clues from this to locate the exact spot where Dutch has buried all of his money.

The Mafia tries to intimidate Billy into giving up the money, but he convinces them that only Schultz&#x27;s lawyer, Dixie Davis, knows where it is. Billy then returns to the Bronx and moves back in with his mother. A year later, Drew, having given birth to Billy&#x27;s child, gives him sole custody. Using the contents of Schultz&#x27;s safe, Billy is able to attend college and fight in World War II. After being discharged, he returns to New York and quietly digs up Schultz&#x27;s fortune, planning to use it to build a new life for himself and his family.

==The novel==
&quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; is the eighth in a series of what critic James Wood has called &quot;intricate historical brocades&quot;. Earlier novels by Doctorow that were also set in the 1930s include &quot;Loon Lake&quot; and &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot;; the latter also shares poetical evocations of the Bronx in which the author himself grew up. Doctorow has described his novel as &quot;a young man&#x27;s sentimental education in the tribal life of gangsters&quot;. A reviewer saw in it &quot;Doctorow’s shapeliest piece of work: a richly detailed report of a 15-year-old boy&#x27;s journey from childhood to adulthood&quot;.

In a radio broadcast, Doctorow described the novel&#x27;s genesis in a picture, whose origin he could no longer remember, of men in tuxedos and black tie on a tugboat. Trying to interpret that image prompted him to ponder &quot;the culture of gangsterism&quot; and its mythic appeal. The novel leads off with Billy&#x27;s description of Bo Weinberg&#x27;s execution (before backtracking to account for how he got there): a performance of which Doctorow explained that &quot;the very first sentence I wrote in &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; is the first sentence that appears in the book, and it actually delivered the character Billy to me. He was sort of built into the diction and the syntax, and even the rhythm of the sentence gave me the way he breathed.&quot; With this as a start, the novel develops into what is largely a first person monologue, less narration than an act of lyrical remembrance. 

In fact, the act of speaking and its interpretation is at the heart of the novel. Through paying close attention to the gangster&#x27;s death-bed ramblings, Billy finds the clue to locate Schultz&#x27;s hidden treasure. And as he himself describes, such attention also leads to his equally valuable discovery of the verbal means to preserve as a lasting memory the lesson of what is otherwise a purely destructive force. &quot;Whereas Schultz&#x27;s rage appropriates everything to his need to destroy, Billy&#x27;s words bear permanent witness to whatever is threatened with impermanence.&quot; 

While most reviewers responded to Doctorow&#x27;s verbal dexterity and reinterpretation of historical facts, they found the ending unconvincingly sentimental. And for one interpreter, at least, the entire plot was grounded in sentimentality, &quot;pure and defiant daydream&quot; based on pulp fiction, its deficiency disguised in a heightened prose that scarcely stops to draw breath and a &quot;vocabulary charged with overkill&quot;.

<text>Luftschiffertruppe, a German word meaning &quot;airshipmen&#x27;s troop&quot;, was the designation of the German airship units.

==Military lighter-than-air aviation==
The origin of the Luftschiffertruppe was the &quot;Versuchsabteilung der Luftschiffertruppe&quot; (&quot;experimental airship unit&quot;) first raised in 1884 as part of the army which was tasked with the evaluation of tethered observation balloons, first using ball-type balloons but in 1896 introducing elongated Parseval-Sigsfeld kite balloons.

On August 1, 1914, the distinction was made between

* &quot;Feldluftschiffer&quot; units operating observation balloons at the frontline,
* &quot;Festungsluftschiffer&quot; units with territorial defense duties,
* the &quot;Luftschifftruppe&quot; operating free-flying airships.

In October 1916, the Feldluftschiffer were subordinated to the &quot;Commanding General of the Air Force&quot;.

==The Luftschifftruppe==
The origin of the Luftschifftruppe (&quot;airship troop&quot;) was a special &quot;Versuchskompanie für Motorluftschiffahrt&quot; (&quot;experimental unit for powered airship navigation&quot;) organized in 1906 as part of the Luftschiffertruppe. After tests of the different available airship types, the semi-rigid Groß airship and the Parseval blimp were abandoned while the rigid airships of Zeppelin and Schütte-Lanz design were selected for service.

While the use of airships for military purposes had been pioneered by the German army, in 1913 the navy raised their own airship troops. After operating in varying command structures for the first years of the war, in late 1916 the navy took over airship operations on the western front while the army became responsible for the east and the Balkans.

==World War I==
Until 1918, the army launched 50 airships, the navy 73. 17 army and 23 navy ships were lost to the enemy, 9 army and 30 navy ships were lost to other causes.

The Luftschiffer became the backbone of German aerial warfare in the first years of the War, conducting reconnaissance flights as well as the first bombings of cities, including Paris and London.

Upon the outbreak of World War I, the Luftschifftruppe numbered around 20–25 zeppelins in service. The Luftschifftruppe began aerial surveillance early on in Belgium and France, but often came under fire by anti-aircraft guns. Because of their slow speed, they were very vulnerable. After three Zeppelins were shot down in the first month alone, the Luftschiffer were switched to naval surveillance, observing British ship movements, in which capacity they played a decisive role in the Battle of Jutland. Tests were done of dropping bombs from Zeppelins in order to increase their potential. Zeppelins had a typical carrying capacity of almost 9 metric tons, making them useful enough for this operation. Following the Christmas truce, Kaiser Wilhelm II approved of the Luftschifftruppe&#x27;s bombing of England. On January 19, 1915, the first bombs fell over Britain, when two Zeppelins dropped 50 kg explosives on villages outside Great Yarmouth. Five people died in the first raid; 18 more raids that year would end in almost 900 casualties. Following the terror, the British government began taking measures to stop the bombings. Anti-aircraft guns were set up all over south-eastern England, as well as spotlights for night time.

The bombings in 1916 were more intense than in 1915. After an accidental bomb-dropping on London, the Kaiser approved of raids directly against the city&#x27;s urban center. Twenty-three raids on London resulted in around 1,800 casualties. Despite safety precautions, civilians were still unprepared for the raids and zeppelins were still able to avoid defenses. By 1917 and 1918 the threat the Luftschifftruppe posed to London was diminished. Large-scale introduction of fighter planes caused nearly half of the planned bombings to end in failure. Only eleven successful raids occurred in the last year of the war. Nearly 80 zeppelins had been built for the Luftschifftruppe during the war; around 60 of them were shot down, including Peter Strasser&#x27;s own zeppelin, with himself on board.

==The Treaty of Versailles==
The Luftschiffer&#x27;s career and service to Germany came to an end when, following World War I, the Luftschifftruppe was dismantled and barred from existence by the Treaty of Versailles, which prohibited Germany from owning an air force under articles 198 and 202.

Before joining the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1996, Taranto spent five years as an editor at &quot;City Journal&quot;. He has also worked for the Heritage Foundation and &quot;Reason&quot; magazine.
He pursued a degree in journalism at California State University, Northridge (CSUN) but &quot;never bothered to graduate&quot; after &quot;conflict with teachers and professors&quot;.

==Rooster incident==
While attending CSUN, Taranto worked as news editor and also as one of two opinion page editors for the &quot;Daily Sundial&quot; student newspaper. On March 5, 1987, Taranto published an opinion piece criticizing a controversy at the University of California, Los Angeles, in which the editor of the &quot;Daily Bruin&quot; student newspaper was suspended after the paper published a comic strip depicting a rooster admitted to the university via affirmative action. Accompanying Taranto&#x27;s column was a reprint of the rooster cartoon. Journalism professor and &quot;Daily Sundial&quot; publisher Cynthia Rawitch suspended Taranto for two weeks without pay. Acting on Taranto&#x27;s behalf, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California filed suit against Rawitch and other members of the CSUN journalism school. The suit was settled before trial on terms favorable to Taranto and the ACLU.

==Best of the Web Today==
Under Taranto, &quot;Best of the Web Today&quot; was a column published weekday afternoons on WSJ.com. It began as an
anonymous web column collecting interesting links. (The title and the use of the editorial &quot;we&quot; come from that era.) Within a year it became a bylined column with commentary as well as links.
Many of the items came from suggestions by readers, and each column ends with thanks to those who contributed to it. A three part quinquennial retrospective of the column appeared in 2005.
In his final column, Taranto announced that the Best of the Web Today feature would return with another editorial writer taking the reins.

<text>George Henry Bissell (November 8, 1821 – November 19, 1884) was an entrepreneur and industrialist who is often considered the father of the American oil industry. His company, the Pennsylvania Rock Oil, was the first Petroleum company in America. His businesses included oil companies, banks, railroads, and substantial real estate in New York. At his death in 1884, his son Pelham would inherit his fortune, making him among the richest men in the United States.

==Early life and education==

Bissell was born in Hanover, New Hampshire, the son of Nancy (Wemple) and Isaac Bissell. His father was a fur trader in Detroit and a Revolutionary war soldier, while his mother was a daughter of John Wemple, a Revolutionary war Captain. He was a descendant of a noble French huguenots family, and had as relatives Yale University graduate Clark Bissell, Connecticut Governor and Senator, and Col. William Henry Bissell, Illinois Governor and Congressman. George Bissell&#x27;s father died when he was twelve years old. 

Bissell attended Dartmouth College, paying his way by teaching and writing newspaper articles. He graduated in 1845 having studied literature and languages.

==Career==
Bissell then continued to earn a living as a teacher at Norwich Academy and also traveled, working as a journalist. He settled for a time in New Orleans, where he served as a high school principal and superintendent of schools. He continued to study languages and also took up the study of law in his spare time. In 1853, Bissell relocated to New York City to become a practicing attorney. Concern over the yellow fever epidemic in New Orleans was a reason for Bissell&#x27;s relocation.

In 1853, during a social visit to Dr. Dixi Crosby, a professor at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, Bissell saw samples of what was then known as &quot;rock oil,&quot; which had been obtained from the ground. Bissell was aware of the primitive oil-gathering industry in western Pennsylvania. At the time, oil was gathered by such crude methods as soaking blankets in surface oil and then draining the blankets over barrels. Rock oil in that period of time was used mainly for medicinal purposes. Bissell recognized that the oil could be refined to produce kerosene, then in high demand, especially for lighting. If the rock oil could be obtained inexpensively and properly refined, it could replace such substances as whale oil and coal oil as sources of fuel for illumination.

Recognizing the potential for rock oil in 1854, Bissell and his law partner Jonathan Eveleth, a Harvard graduate, decided to start their own firm. Eveleth &amp; Bissell will be formed and their office would be in New York at 14 Wall Street, on Wall Street. Together, they purchased a 105-acre farm, the Hibbard Farm which was owned by timber company Brewer, Watson &amp; Co, at a cost of $5000. The timber company had also received a competitive offer from Samuel Kier, a pioneer in oil refining, and an early founder of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, an important competitor of Andrew Carnegie. 

Despite having received a lucrative offer from Kier, Brewer, Watson &amp; Co decided to accept the one of Bissell and Eveleth, as they intended to sell the stock of their new enterprise through New York&#x27;s financial markets, and Brewer, Watson &amp; Co. perceived that they could therefore develop an equity position in the new business. In December 1854, Bissell and Eveleth formed the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company while transferring ownership of the Hibbard Farm to the new company. The Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co. was the first oil exploration company in the United States. Early in the enterprise, Bissell and Eveleth gained the support of James Townsend, a bank President from New Haven, Connecticut, who helped them obtain further support.

Shortly after obtaining the Hibbard Farm, Bissell and Eveleth hired Yale University chemist Benjamin Silliman Jr. and coal oil chemist Luther Atwood of Boston to evaluate the suitability of the rock oil for making a refined oil suitable for illumination. The evaluation included an economic study and a chemical analysis, and Atwood was positive on the prospects from the beginning of the evaluation. Silliman was more cautious, although he issued a promising opinion in May 1855. Silliman&#x27;s evaluation cost Bissell and Eveleth $1200. With these expert opinions, Bissell and Eveleth continued with their endeavor.

===Seneca Oil Company===

In 1856, after seeing pictures of derrick drilling for salt, Bissell conceived of the idea of drilling for oil, rather than mining it or digging for it as is done with salt wells. This was widely considered ludicrous at the time. However, Bissell and Eveleth pursued the idea and sought investors. This included a group from New Haven, Connecticut, who eventually formed the Seneca Oil Company. Bissell and Eveleth had a royalty dispute with the investors in Seneca Oil Co., although a business relationship resulted.

On August 27, 1859, the company first succeeded in striking oil, on a farm in Titusville, Pennsylvania. John D. Rockefeller took notice of this event and decided to jump on the opportunity and joined the Pennsylvania oil rush, forming his own oil-refining business with Maurice B. Clark, naming it Clark &amp; Rockefeller. Rockefeller&#x27;s enterprise would evolve into the Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler partnership, with Samuel Andrews, Henry Flagler, and Stephen V. Harkness as associates.

As a result of the first success at striking oil, a business relationship will develop between Bissell&#x27;s Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co. and Seneca Oil Company. Colonel Edwin Drake became involved in the enterprise through his employment with Seneca Oil Co., and Drake played a critical role in the first successful oil well in the region. Bissell, through Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co., invested heavily in the surrounding region with significant financial success. With time, Seneca Oil Co. became unable to pay the royalties due to the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company. 

The matter was resolved when Bissell and Eveleth agreed to forgive the unpaid royalties in exchange for taking full title to the portion of the Hibbard Farm that Seneca Oil controlled. Additionally, Eveleth died in 1862. As a result of these two events, Bissell had much control over development of this oil-producing region. He continued to attract investors, to develop new oil fields in the region, and built a railroad to carry the oil to markets. In an 1866 economic downturn, Bissell opened a bank in the region, George H. Bissell &amp; Co., to assure continued development of the oil-producing region. His bank at Petroleum Center, Pennsylvania, with office at 5 Beekman Street, New York, was regarded as one of the most substantial banking institution in the oil industry at the time.

===Investments===
When Bissell&#x27;s oil enterprise began to flourish, he moved from New York City to the Pennsylvania Oil Region, taking up residence at the Franklin Hotel in Franklin, Pennsylvania. He lived in Pennsylvania until 1864, when he returned to New York City. On his return, Bissell diversified his investments and started to include insurance in his portfolio. In addition to the Hibbard Farm and his bank, Bissell&#x27;s other investments in the region included various other farms and oil wells, a barrel factory, the Central Petroleum Company, the Farmer’s Railroad, United Petroleum Farms Company, and the George H. Bissell Express Company. 

When retiring in New York, he was the owner of 3 banks, a railroad, and was also director and President of various companies, such as the Peruvian Petroleum Company and the Peruvian Refining Company. He and other investors started these companies with a capital of 5 millions dollars and a lease on 4.5 millions acres of land. They supplied most of the oil in west South America, exporting the surplus to Australia, England and New Zealand.

He also invested extensively in real estate, becoming one of the largest operators in dealing in New York real estate, which would be inherited by his son Pelham, along with his oil companies, banks and railroads. His son became a millionaire as a result, as seen in the registry of the American Millionaires of 1892, with a fortune of over a million dollars, which translate to over a billion dollars in 2022 money. There was only 4047 millionaires in the United States at the time, making him among the richest men in the country.

==Legacy==
As the decade progressed, large producers like John D. Rockefeller would learn at his expense, and would begin to consolidate the oil wells and refineries in Pennsylvania. By 1882, with the formation of the Standard Oil Trust, Rockefeller would effectively establish a monopoly over the industry in the region, and with the discovery of oil in other states, the nation&#x27;s interest would shift elsewhere. 

Other competitors also emerged in the oil industry, such as the Nobel family through Branobel, later known for their Nobel Prize award, and the French branch of the Rothschild family, through the Caspian and Black Sea Oil Company led by Alphonse de Rothschild.

George H. Bissell&#x27;s name would be seen as a household word among oil men during his lifetime, and from all over the continent. In the oil industry, he was a giant, and his business empire was seen as an industry of its own.

Bissell funded the Bissell Hall which was a gymnasium on the campus of Dartmouth University that included a gymnastics center, a bowling alley, and an indoor track. This building was demolished in 1958. A residence hall constructed that year, Bissell Hall of the Choates, is now named in his honor. 

The Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co.&#x27;s agent, Edwin Drake, is sometimes credited with the &quot;discovery&quot; of oil, although the success of Drake&#x27;s efforts is due in part to Bissell&#x27;s business acumen.

Bissell and his enterprises are also featured in the Pulitzer award book &quot;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bissell&#x27;s wife was Ophie Louise Griffin, with whom he had two children. Ophie died in 1867. At the time of Bissell&#x27;s death in 1884, he was living at 16 West 40th Street in New York City. He was interred at the Dartmouth College Cemetery.

His son, Pelham St. George Bissell, a millionaire of 1892, married to Helen Alsop French, daughter of Colonel Thomas J. French. He was educated at Columbia College, and was a large owner of the Adirondacks Pulp Company, later merged into the International Paper Company. He was also a member of the Columbia Alumni Association, the New York Athletic Club and the New York Historical Society.

His grandson, Pelham St. George Bissell Jr., married to Mary Valentine Yale Bissell (1889-1948), a member of the Yale family and his third cousin. Her mother, Mary Valentine Yale (1870-1916), niece of Dr. Leroy Milton Yale Jr., was the wife of Eugene Van Name Bissell, and sister-in-law of shipping magnate Edgar F. Luckenbach, whose niece was daughter of Charles Yost, United Nations Ambassador under President Nixon. Her brother, Eugene Bissell Jr., was the proprietor of the Cedar Hill Estate in 1946, originally owned by George Ludlow Lee Sr., and was sold in 1950 to John Jacob Astor VI of the Astor family, and became known as the Astor Estate. Astor lived at the Astor Mansion on Fifth Avenue and was the grandson of Mrs. Astor of Beechwood.

The Bissell couple resided on Park Avenue, New York. Pelham Jr. served as a special attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, and as Judge and President Justice of the Municipal Court of the City of New York. He also served as Chairman of the Mayor&#x27;s Board of Survey, joined the Union League Club of New York, and served in the army as Lieutenant, Captain, Major and Lieutenant-Colonel.

Mary Valentine Yale served as Chairman of American Legion Auxiliary in New York, Chairman of the First New York District of the Auxiliary, President of the Greenwich Village unit, and Salon 33, Society of 8 and 40. She was also member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and of the Society of Mayflower Descendants. One of their children, Pelham St. George Bissell III, was Lieutenant-Colonel during World War II, Judge of Manhattan&#x27;s Civil Court for 30 years, and a graduate from Columbia University. A daughter, Ophelia Molla Bissell, married Brigadier General William Wilbur.

<doc id="697890" wikidata="Q126691" url="?curid=697890" title="Gestational diabetes">
<text>Gestational diabetes is a condition in which a woman without diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes generally results in few symptoms. Obesity increases the rate of pre-eclampsia, cesarean sections, and embryo macrosomia, as well as gestational diabetes. Babies born to individuals with poorly treated gestational diabetes are at increased risk of macrosomia, of having hypoglycemia after birth, and of jaundice. If untreated, diabetes can also result in stillbirth. Long term, children are at higher risk of being overweight and of developing type 2 diabetes.
Gestational diabetes can occur during pregnancy because of insulin resistance or reduced production of insulin. Risk factors include being overweight, previously having gestational diabetes, a family history of type 2 diabetes, and having polycystic ovarian syndrome. Diagnosis is by blood tests. For those at normal risk, screening is recommended between 24 and 28 weeks&#x27; gestation. For those at high risk, testing may occur at the first prenatal visit.
Maintenance of healthy weight and exercising before pregnancy assist in prevention. Gestational diabetes is treated with a diabetic diet, exercise, medication (such as metformin), and sometimes insulin injections. Most people manage blood sugar with diet and exercise. Blood sugar testing among those who are affected is often recommended four times a day. Breastfeeding is recommended as soon as possible after birth.
Gestational diabetes affects 3–9% of pregnancies, depending on the population studied. It is especially common during the third trimester. It affects 1% of those under the age of 20 and 13% of those over the age of 44. A number of ethnic groups including Asians, American Indians, Indigenous Australians, and Pacific Islanders are at higher risk. However, the variations in prevalence are also due to different screening strategies and diagnostic criteria being used. In 90% of cases, gestational diabetes resolves after the baby is born. Affected people, however, are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

==Classification==
Gestational diabetes is formally defined as &quot;any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy&quot;. This definition acknowledges the possibility that a woman may have previously undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, or may have developed diabetes coincidentally with pregnancy. Whether symptoms subside after pregnancy is also irrelevant to the diagnosis.
A woman is diagnosed with gestational diabetes when glucose intolerance continues beyond 24 to 28 weeks of gestation.

The White classification, named after Priscilla White, who pioneered research on the effect of diabetes types on perinatal outcome, is widely used to assess maternal and fetal risk. It distinguishes between gestational diabetes (type A) and pregestational diabetes (diabetes that existed prior to pregnancy). These two groups are further subdivided according to their associated risks and management.

The two subtypes of gestational diabetes under this classification system are:
* Type A1: abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), but normal blood glucose levels during fasting and two hours after meals; diet modification is sufficient to control glucose levels
* Type A2: abnormal OGTT compounded by abnormal glucose levels during fasting or after meals; additional therapy with insulin or other medications is required

Diabetes which existed prior to pregnancy is also split up into several subtypes under this system:
* Type B: onset at age 20 or older and duration of less than 10 years.
* Type C: onset at age 10–19 or duration of 10–19 years.
* Type D: onset before age 10 or duration greater than 20 years.
* Type E: overt diabetes mellitus with calcified pelvic vessels.
* Type F: diabetic nephropathy.
* Type R: proliferative retinopathy.
* Type RF: retinopathy and nephropathy.
* Type H: ischemic heart disease.
* Type T: prior kidney transplant.

An early age of onset or long-standing disease comes with greater risks, hence the first three subtypes.

Two other sets of criteria are available for diagnosis of gestational diabetes, both based on blood-sugar levels.

Criteria for diagnosis of gestational diabetes, using the 100 gram Glucose Tolerance Test, according to Carpenter and Coustan:
* Fasting 95 mg/dl
* 1 hour 180 mg/dl
* 2 hours 155 mg/dl
* 3 hours 140 mg/dl

Criteria for diagnosis of gestational diabetes according to National Diabetes Data Group:
* Fasting 105 mg/dl
* 1 hour 190 mg/dl
* 2 hours 165 mg/dl
* 3 hours 145 mg/dl

The third criterion used was endorsed by Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India and approved by the National Health Mission in its Guidelines
DIPSI(Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India Guidelines

OGTT is performed in pregnant women by measuring the plasma glucose after 2 hours of fasting or non-fasting after ingesting 75 grams of glucose (Monohydrate Dextrose Anhydrous). The Indian Guidelines (DIPSI Test) are simple for diagnosing gestational diabetes (GDM). They can be done quickly in low-resource settings, where many pregnant women visit for ANC check-ups in a Non-fasting state. A single value of ≥140 mg/dl is diagnostic for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.

Guidelines to Screen glucose intolerance at appropriate Gestational weeks: Prediction of GDM can be done if 2hr PPBG≥110 mg/dl at 10th week. At the 8th week itself, PPBG needs to be estimated because, in case PPBG is &gt; 110 mg/dl at this week, a grace period of 2 weeks is available to bring it down to PPBG &lt;110 mg/dl at the 10th week with metformin 250 mg twice a day, in addition to Medical Nutritional Therapy (MNT) and exercise.

==Risk factors==
Classical risk factors for developing gestational diabetes are:
* Polycystic ovary syndrome
* A previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or prediabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glycaemia
* A family history revealing a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes
* Maternal age – a woman&#x27;s risk factor increases as she gets older (especially for women over 35 years of age).
* Paternal age – one study found that a father&#x27;s age over 55 years was associated with GD
* Ethnicity (those with higher risk factors include African-Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, Native Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, and people originating from South Asia)
* Being overweight, obese or severely obese increases the risk by a factor 2.1, 3.6 and 8.6, respectively.
* A previous pregnancy which resulted in a child with a macrosomia (high birth weight: &gt;90th centile or &gt;4000 g (8 lbs 12.8 oz))
* Previous poor obstetric history
* Other genetic risk factors: There are at least 10 genes where certain polymorphism are associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, most notably TCF7L2. The MTNR1B gene is a common gene that is associated with how the body handles insulin and glucose. When this gene is not working properly, it can lead to less insulin production and higher blood glucose levels.

In addition to this, statistics show a double risk of GDM in smokers. Some studies have looked at more controversial potential risk factors, such as short stature.

About 40–60% of women with GDM have no demonstrable risk factor; for this reason many advocate to screen all women. Typically, women with GDM exhibit no symptoms (another reason for universal screening), but some women may demonstrate increased thirst, increased urination, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, bladder infection, yeast infections and blurred vision.

Pregnant women with these risk factors may need to undergo an early screening in addition to the routine screening.

==Pathophysiology==

The precise mechanisms underlying gestational diabetes remain unknown. The hallmark of GDM is increased insulin resistance. Pregnancy hormones and other factors are thought to interfere with the action of insulin as it binds to the insulin receptor. The interference probably occurs at the level of the cell signaling pathway beyond the insulin receptor. Since insulin promotes the entry of glucose into most cells, insulin resistance prevents glucose from entering the cells properly. As a result, glucose remains in the bloodstream, where glucose levels rise. More insulin is needed to overcome this resistance; about 1.5–2.5 times more insulin is produced than in a normal pregnancy.

Insulin resistance is a normal phenomenon emerging in the second trimester of pregnancy, which in cases of GDM progresses thereafter to levels seen in a non-pregnant woman with type 2 diabetes. It is thought to secure glucose supply to the growing fetus. Women with GDM have an insulin resistance that they cannot compensate for with increased production in the β-cells of the pancreas. Placental hormones, and, to a lesser extent, increased fat deposits during pregnancy, seem to mediate insulin resistance during pregnancy. Cortisol and progesterone are the main culprits, but human placental lactogen, prolactin and estradiol contribute, too. Multivariate stepwise regression analysis reveals that, in combination with other placental hormones, leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and resistin are involved in the decrease in insulin sensitivity occurring during pregnancy, with tumor necrosis factor alpha named as the strongest independent predictor of insulin sensitivity in pregnancy. An inverse correlation with the changes in insulin sensitivity from the time before conception through late gestation accounts for about half of the variance in the decrease in insulin sensitivity during gestation: in other words, low levels or alteration of TNF alpha factors corresponds with a greater chance of, or predisposition to, insulin resistance or sensitivity.

It is unclear why some women are unable to balance insulin needs and develop GDM; however, a number of explanations have been given, similar to those in type 2 diabetes: autoimmunity, single gene mutations, obesity, along with other mechanisms.

Though the clinical presentation of gestational diabetes is well characterized, the biochemical mechanism behind the disease is not well known. One proposed biochemical mechanism involves insulin-producing β-cell adaptation controlled by the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway. β-cell adaption refers to the change that pancreatic islet cells undergo during pregnancy in response to maternal hormones in order to compensate for the increased physiological needs of mother and baby. These changes in the β-cells cause increased insulin secretion as a result of increased β-cell proliferation.
HGF/c-MET has also been implicated in β-cell regeneration, which suggests that HGF/c-MET may help increase β-cell mass in order to compensate for insulin needs during pregnancy. Recent studies support that loss of HGF/c-MET signaling results in aberrant β-cell adaptation.

c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is activated by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and is involved in the activation of several cellular processes. When HGF binds c-MET, the receptor homodimerizes and self-phosphorylates to form an SH2 recognition domain. The downstream pathways activated include common signaling molecules such as RAS and MAPK, which affect cell motility, and cell cycle progression.

Studies have shown that HGF is an important signaling molecule in stress related situations where more insulin is needed. Pregnancy causes increased insulin resistance and so a higher insulin demand. The β-cells must compensate for this by either increasing insulin production or proliferating. If neither of the processes occur, then markers for gestational diabetes are observed. It has been observed that pregnancy increases HGF levels, showing a correlation that suggests a connection between the signaling pathway and increased insulin needs. In fact, when no signaling is present, gestational diabetes is more likely to occur.

The exact mechanism of HGF/c-MET regulated β-cell adaptation is not yet known but there are several hypotheses about how the signaling molecules contribute to insulin levels during pregnancy. c-MET may interact with FoxM1, a molecule important in the cell cycle, as FOXM1 levels decrease when c-MET is not present. Additionally, c-MET may interact with p27 as the protein levels increase with c-MET is not present. Another hypothesis says that c-MET may control β-cell apoptosis because a lack of c-MET causes increases cell death but the signaling mechanisms have not been elucidated.

Although the mechanism of HGF/c-MET control of gestational diabetes is not yet well understood, there is a strong correlation between the signaling pathway and the inability to produce an adequate amount of insulin during pregnancy and thus it may be the target for future diabetic therapies.

Because glucose travels across the placenta (through diffusion facilitated by GLUT1 carrier), which is located in the syncytiotrophoblast on both the microvillus and basal membranes, these membranes may be the rate-limiting step in placental glucose transport. There is a two- to three-fold increase in the expression of syncytiotrophoblast glucose transporters with advancing gestation. Finally, the role of GLUT3/GLUT4 transport remains speculative. If the untreated gestational diabetes fetus is exposed to consistently higher glucose levels, this leads to increased fetal levels of insulin (insulin itself cannot cross the placenta). The growth-stimulating effects of insulin can lead to excessive growth and a large body (macrosomia). After birth, the high glucose environment disappears, leaving these newborns with ongoing high insulin production and susceptibility to low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia).

==Screening==
A number of screening and diagnostic tests have been used to look for high levels of glucose in plasma or serum in defined circumstances. One method is a stepwise approach where a suspicious result on a screening test is followed by diagnostic test. Alternatively, a more involved diagnostic test can be used directly at the first prenatal visit for a woman with a high-risk pregnancy. (for example in those with polycystic ovarian syndrome or acanthosis nigricans).

Non-challenge blood glucose tests involve measuring glucose levels in blood samples without challenging the subject with glucose solutions. A blood glucose level is determined when fasting, two hours after a meal, or simply at any random time. In contrast, challenge tests involve drinking a glucose solution and measuring glucose concentration thereafter in the blood; in diabetes, they tend to remain high. The glucose solution has a very sweet taste which some women find unpleasant; sometimes, therefore, artificial flavours are added. Some women may experience nausea during the test, and more so with higher glucose levels.

There is currently not enough research to show which way is best at diagnosing gestational diabetes. Routine screening of women with a glucose challenge test may find more women with gestational diabetes than only screening women with risk factors. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is not recommended for diagnosing gestational diabetes, as it is a less reliable marker of glycemia during pregnancy than oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT).

Because women diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes (GDM) during pregnancy are at an increased risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus after pregnancy, post pregnancy glucose tolerance testing is needed. Based on the recent meta-analysis conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, research has shown that post pregnancy testing reminders are associated with greater adherence to oral glucose tolerance testing up to 1 year postpartum.

===Pathways===
Opinions differ about optimal screening and diagnostic measures, in part due to differences in population risks, cost-effectiveness considerations, and lack of an evidence base to support large national screening programs. The most elaborate regimen entails a random blood glucose test during a booking visit, a screening glucose challenge test around 24–28 weeks&#x27; gestation, followed by an OGTT if the tests are outside normal limits. If there is a high suspicion, a woman may be tested earlier.

In the United States, most obstetricians prefer universal screening with a screening glucose challenge test. In the United Kingdom, obstetric units often rely on risk factors and a random blood glucose test. The American Diabetes Association and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommend routine screening unless the woman is low risk (this means the woman must be younger than 25 years and have a body mass index less than 27, with no personal, ethnic or family risk factors) The Canadian Diabetes Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend universal screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening, and a 2017 a Cochrane review found that there is not evidence to determine which screening method is best for women and their babies.

Some pregnant women and care providers choose to forgo routine screening due to the absence of risk factors, however this is not advised due to the large proportion of women who develop gestational diabetes despite having no risk factors present and the dangers to the mother and baby if gestational diabetes remains untreated.

===Non-challenge blood glucose tests===
When a plasma glucose level is found to be higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) after fasting, or over 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) on any occasion, and if this is confirmed on a subsequent day, the diagnosis of GDM is made, and no further testing is required. These tests are typically performed at the first antenatal visit. They are simple to administer and inexpensive, but have a lower test performance compared to the other tests, with moderate sensitivity, low specificity and high false positive rates.

===Screening glucose challenge test===
The screening glucose challenge test (sometimes called the O&#x27;Sullivan test) is performed between 24 and 28 weeks, and can be seen as a simplified version of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). No previous fasting is required for this screening test, in contrast to the OGTT. The O&#x27;Sullivan test involves drinking a solution containing 50 grams of glucose, and measuring blood levels one hour later.

If the cut-off point is set at 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), 80% of women with GDM will be detected. If this threshold for further testing is lowered to 130 mg/dL, 90% of GDM cases will be detected, but there will also be more women who will be subjected to a consequent OGTT unnecessarily.

===Oral glucose tolerance test===
A standardized oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be done in the morning after an overnight fast of between 8 and 14 hours. During the three previous days the subject must have an unrestricted diet (containing at least 150 g carbohydrate per day) and unlimited physical activity. The subject should remain seated during the test and should not smoke throughout the test.

IADPSG (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups) has developed diagnostic criteria for GDM, based on the results of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study. These were recommended by WHO 2013.

According to these gestational diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed at any time in pregnancy if one of the following criteria are met, using a 75 g glucose OGTT:
* Fasting blood glucose level ≥92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)
* 1 hour blood glucose level ≥180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L)
* 2 hour blood glucose level ≥153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)

===Urinary glucose testing===
Women with GDM may have high glucose levels in their urine (glucosuria). Although dipstick testing is widely practiced, it performs poorly, and discontinuing routine dipstick testing has not been shown to cause underdiagnosis where universal screening is performed. Increased glomerular filtration rates during pregnancy contribute to some 50% of women having glucose in their urine on dipstick tests at some point during their pregnancy. Glomerular filtration rates increase during pregnancy due to an increase in blood volume to support the fetus. The sensitivity of glucosuria for GDM in the first two trimesters is only around 10% and the positive predictive value is around 20%.

==Prevention==
Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may help to prevent gestational diabetes. A 2015 review found that when done during pregnancy moderate physical exercise is effective for the prevention of gestational diabetes. A 2014 review however did not find a significant effect. It is uncertain if additional dietary advice interventions help to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes. However, data from the Nurses&#x27; Health Study shows that adherence to a healthy plant-based diet is associated with lower risk for GDM.
Diet and physical activity interventions designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain reduce the rates of gestational diabetes. However, the impact of these interventions varies with the body-mass index of the person as well as with the region in which the studies were performed.

Moderate-quality evidence suggest that there is a reduced risk of gestational diabetes mellitus and caesarean section with combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy as well as reductions in gestational weight gain, compared with standard care.

A 2023 review found that a plant-based diet (including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and tea) rich in phytochemicals lowers the risk of GDM. A Cochrane review, updated 2023, stated that myo‐inositol has a potential beneficial effect of improving insulin sensitivity, which suggested that it may be useful for women in preventing gestational diabetes″.

It has been suggested that for women who have had gestational diabetes, diet, exercise, education, and lifestyle changes between pregnancies may lower their chances of having gestational diabetes again in future pregnancies. For women with a normal BMI pre-pregnancy, light to moderate exercise for 30-60 minutes three times a week during pregnancy can decrease the occurrence of GDM. It was found that women who completed at least 600 MET-min/week of moderate intensity exercise can cause at least a 25% reduction in the odds of developing GDM. When studying the difference effects between aerobic and resistance training, it was found that there were no differences in fasting blood glucose levels, insulin utilization rate, or pregnancy outcomes. However, there was an better improvement in the 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level. The resistance training group was also more compliant with their workout program than the aerobic group. Based on this information, resistance training may be a better option for women with gestational diabetes, but doing both aerobic training and resistance training would be optimal.

==Management==


Treatment of GDM with diet and insulin reduces health problems mother and child. Treatment of GDM is also accompanied by more inductions of labour.

A repeat OGTT should be carried out 6 weeks after delivery, to confirm the diabetes has disappeared. Afterwards, regular screening for type 2 diabetes is advised.

Lifestyle interventions include exercise, diet advice, behavioural interventions, relaxation, self-monitoring glucose, and combined interventions. Women with gestational diabetes who receive lifestyle interventions seem to have less postpartum depression, and were more likely to reach their weight loss targets after giving birth, than women who had no intervention. Their babies are also less likely to be large for their gestational age, and have less percentage of fat when they are born. More research is needed to find out which lifestyle interventions are best. Some women with GDM use probiotics but it is very uncertain if there are any benefits in terms of blood glucose levels, high blood pressure disorders or induction of labour.

If a diabetic diet or G.I. Diet, exercise, and oral medication are inadequate to control glucose levels, insulin therapy may become necessary.

The development of macrosomia can be evaluated during pregnancy by using sonography. Women who use insulin, with a history of stillbirth, or with hypertension are managed like women with overt diabetes.

Researchers have found ways for pregnant women with gestational diabetes to reduce their complications with their current health, long-term effects, and fetal health with the help of exercise. Laredo-Aguilera, et al., and Dipla, et al., presented findings from systematic and meta-analysis reviews that showed positive effects of resistance exercise or a combination of resistance and aerobic exercise. Aerobic and resistance training was found to control glucose, HbcA1, and insulin levels in women with GDM. Not only is the mother&#x27;s health affected, but also the fetus. If GDM is not treated or is made worse, the child may suffer from macrosomia, impaired intrauterine growth, obstetric trauma, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, or even infection. Pregnant women with GDM who are overweight or obese are at a greater risk to pass down these negative affects by 2.14-3.56 times. Benefits to resistance and aerobic exercise include maternal decrease in cramps, lower back pain, edema, depression, urinary incontinence, duration of labor, constipation, and the number of c-sections. These benefits can affect the fetus by having a decreased body fat mass, improved stress tolerance, and advanced neurobehavioral maturation. In the article written by Laredo-Aguilera, et al., there were seven interventions and seven different countries that were used for research. Within all of the interventions there were significant improvements in glucose concentration, reduced requirements of insulin injections, postprandial glucose level control, and glycemic control. The study reviewed by Dipla, et al., found that even a single exercise bout increases skeletal muscle glucose uptake, minimizing hyperglycemia. Regular exercise training has been found to promote mitochondrial biogenesis, improve oxidative capacity, enhance insulin sensitivity and vascular function, and reduce systemic inflammation in women with GDM. Women with GDM must provide enough glucose to the fetus, but often become insulin resistant. Exercise has been previously known to be dangerous for women during pregnancy, but now there are multiple studies that have found otherwise. It is very important for women with gestational diabetes to measure their heart rate reserve to determine exercise intensity and exercise at a RPE between 12 and 14.  

===Lifestyle===
Counselling before pregnancy (for example, about preventive folic acid supplements) and multidisciplinary management are important for good pregnancy outcomes. Most women can manage their GDM with dietary changes and exercise. Self monitoring of blood glucose levels can guide therapy. Some women will need antidiabetic drugs, most commonly insulin therapy.

Any diet needs to provide sufficient calories for pregnancy, typically 2,000–2,500 kcal with the exclusion of simple carbohydrates. The main goal of dietary modifications is to avoid peaks in blood sugar levels. This can be done by spreading carbohydrate intake over meals and snacks throughout the day, and using slow-release carbohydrate sources—known as the G.I. Diet. Since insulin resistance is highest in mornings, breakfast carbohydrates need to be restricted more.

The Mediterranean diet may be associated with reduced incidence of gestational diabetes. However, there is not enough evidence to indicate if one type of dietary advice is better than another.

Though there is no specific structure for exercise programs for GDM, it is understood that being subjected to constant exposure to a sedentary lifestyle and participating in &lt;2999 MET-mins a week in physical activity is linked to a 10 times higher risk of developing GDM. Conversely, partaking in  &gt; 3000 MET-mins of any physical activity can reduce developing GDM. However, light intensity walking is an effective way to help control casual glucose level (CGL), but a minimum of 6000 steps must be achieved daily to have consistent effectiveness in controlling CGL. Nevertheless there is no significant correlation between light intensity walking and hbA1c, therefore regular moderate intensity exercise is advised, specifically aerobic exercise has been proven to improve both fasting and postprandial blood glucose, insulin dosage, and insulin usage within the body.  It is still contested which form of exercise/physical activity is best for pregnant women, yet some movement is better than no movement.

Although exercise does not reduce the risk of developing GDM, it does help reduce some of the risk associated with it. When it comes to exercise in pregnant women who have GDM there is a decrease in the risk of having a newborn with macrosomia, decrease in maternal weight gain and a decrease in c-sections. Although exercise is not the cure for GDM it does help pregnant women decrease any complication or risk factors that can arise from disease.

Self monitoring can be accomplished using a handheld capillary glucose dosage system. Compliance with these glucometer systems can be low. There is not a lot of research into what target blood sugar levels should be for women with gestational diabetes and targets recommended to women vary around the world. Target ranges advised by the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society are as follows:
* fasting capillary blood glucose levels &lt;5.5 mmol/L
* 1 hour postprandial capillary blood glucose levels &lt;8.0 mmol/L
* 2 hour postprandial blood glucose levels &lt;6.7 mmol/L
Regular blood samples can be used to determine HbA1c levels, which give an idea of glucose control over a longer time period.

Research suggests a possible benefit of breastfeeding to reduce the risk of diabetes and related risks for both mother and child.

===Medication===
If monitoring reveals failing control of glucose levels with these measures, or if there is evidence of complications like excessive fetal growth, treatment with insulin might be necessary. This is most commonly fast-acting insulin given just before eating to blunt glucose rises after meals. Care needs to be taken to avoid low blood sugar levels due to excessive insulin. Insulin therapy can be normal or very tight; more injections can result in better control but requires more effort, and there is no consensus that it has large benefits. A 2016 Cochrane review (updated in 2023) concluded that quality evidence is not yet available to determine the best blood sugar range for improving health for pregnant women with GDM and their babies.

There is some evidence that certain medications by mouth might be safe in pregnancy, or at least, are less dangerous to the developing fetus than poorly controlled diabetes. When comparing which diabetes tablets (medication by mouth) work best and are safest, there is not enough quality research to support one medication over another. The medication metformin is better than glyburide. If blood glucose cannot be adequately controlled with a single agent, the combination of metformin and insulin may be better than insulin alone. Another review found good short term safety for both the mother and baby with metformin but unclear long term safety.

People may prefer metformin by mouth to insulin injections. Treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome with metformin during pregnancy has been noted to decrease GDM levels.

Almost half of the women did not reach sufficient control with metformin alone and needed supplemental therapy with insulin; compared to those treated with insulin alone, they required less insulin, and they gained less weight. With no long-term studies into children of women treated with the drug, there remains a possibility of long-term complications from metformin therapy. Babies born to women treated with metformin have been found to develop less visceral fat, making them less prone to insulin resistance in later life.

==Prognosis==
Gestational diabetes generally resolves once the baby is born. Based on different studies, the chances of developing GDM in a second pregnancy, if a woman had GDM in her first pregnancy, are between 30 and 84%, depending on ethnic background. A second pregnancy within one year of the previous pregnancy has a large likelihood of GDM recurrence.

Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus in the future. The risk is highest in women who needed insulin treatment, had antibodies associated with diabetes (such as antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase, islet cell antibodies, or insulinoma antigen-2), women with more than two previous pregnancies, and women who were obese (in order of importance). Women requiring insulin to manage gestational diabetes have a 50% risk of developing diabetes within the next five years. Depending on the population studied, the diagnostic criteria and the length of follow-up, the risk can vary enormously. The risk appears to be highest in the first 5 years, reaching a plateau thereafter. One of the longest studies followed a group of women from Boston, Massachusetts; half of them developed diabetes after 6 years, and more than 70% had diabetes after 28 years. In a retrospective study in Navajo women, the risk of diabetes after GDM was estimated to be 50 to 70% after 11 years. Another study found a risk of diabetes after GDM of more than 25% after 15 years. In populations with a low risk for type 2 diabetes, in lean subjects and in women with auto-antibodies, there is a higher rate of women developing type 1 diabetes (LADA).

Children of women with GDM have an increased risk for childhood and adult obesity and an increased risk of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes later in life. This risk relates to increased maternal glucose values. It is currently unclear how much genetic susceptibility and environmental factors contribute to this risk, and whether treatment of GDM can influence this outcome.

Relative benefits and harms of different oral anti-diabetic medications are not yet well understood as of 2017.

There are scarce statistical data on the risk of other conditions in women with GDM; in the Jerusalem Perinatal study, 410 out of 37,962 women were reported to have GDM, and there was a tendency towards more breast and pancreatic cancer, but more research is needed to confirm this finding.

Research is being conducted to develop a web-based clinical decision support system for GDM prediction using machine learning techniques. Results so far demonstrated great potential in clinical practicality for automatic GDM prognosis.

===Complications===
GDM poses a risk to mother and child. This risk is largely related to uncontrolled blood glucose levels and its consequences. The risk increases with higher blood glucose levels. Treatment resulting in better control of these levels can reduce some of the risks of GDM considerably.

Having GDM can lead to mental health issues with the distress added onto the pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes experienced increased anxiety, depression, and stress. Not only does it affect mental health during pregnancy, but it also leads to an increased risk of postpartum depression. The risk is over 4 times greater than a normal pregnancy. It was found that physical activity could decrease the risk for postpartum depression. It is a form of therapy that can help reduce the stress of these mental health issues.

The two main risks GDM imposes on the baby are growth abnormalities and chemical imbalances after birth, which may require admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. Infants born to mothers with GDM are at risk of being both large for gestational age (macrosomic) in unmanaged GDM, and small for gestational age and Intrauterine growth retardation in managed GDM. Macrosomia in turn increases the risk of instrumental deliveries (e.g. forceps, ventouse and caesarean section) or problems during vaginal delivery (such as shoulder dystocia). Macrosomia may affect 12% of normal women compared to 20% of women with GDM. However, the evidence for each of these complications is not equally strong; in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study for example, there was an increased risk for babies to be large but not small for gestational age in women with uncontrolled GDM. In a recent birth cohort study of 5150 deliveries, a research group active at the University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Finland demonstrated that the mother&#x27;s GDM is an independent factor that increases the risk of fetal hypoxia, during labour. The study was published in the &quot;Acta Diabetologica&quot; in June 2021. Another finding was that GDM increased the susceptibility of the fetus to intrapartum hypoxia, regardless of the size of the fetus. The risk of hypoxia and the resulting risk of poor condition in newborn infants was nearly 7-fold in the fetuses of mothers with GDM compared to the fetuses of non-diabetic mothers. Furthermore, according to the findings, the risk of needing to perform resuscitation on the newborn after birth was 10-fold.

Another finding was that gestational diabetes increased the susceptibility of the fetus to intrapartal hypoxia, regardless of the size of the fetus.

&quot;The risk of hypoxia and the resulting risk of poor condition in newborn infants was nearly seven-fold in the fetuses of mothers with gestational diabetes compared to the fetuses of non-diabetic mothers,&quot; says researcher Mikko Tarvonen. According to the findings, the risk of needing to perform resuscitation on the newborn was ten-fold. Research into complications for GDM is difficult because of the many confounding factors (such as obesity). Labelling a woman as having GDM may in itself increase the risk of having an unnecessary caesarean section.

Neonates born from women with consistently high blood sugar levels are also at an increased risk of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), jaundice, high red blood cell mass (polycythemia) and low blood calcium (hypocalcemia) and magnesium (hypomagnesemia). Untreated GDM also interferes with maturation, causing dysmature babies prone to respiratory distress syndrome due to incomplete lung maturation and impaired surfactant synthesis.

Unlike pre-gestational diabetes, gestational diabetes has not been clearly shown to be an independent risk factor for birth defects. Birth defects usually originate sometime during the first trimester (before the 13th week) of pregnancy, whereas GDM gradually develops and is least pronounced during the first and early second trimester. Studies have shown that the offspring of women with GDM are at a higher risk for congenital malformations. A large case-control study found that gestational diabetes was linked with a limited group of birth defects, and that this association was generally limited to women with a higher body mass index (≥ 25 kg/m2). It is difficult to make sure that this is not partially due to the inclusion of women with pre-existent type 2 diabetes who were not diagnosed before pregnancy.

Because of conflicting studies, it is unclear at the moment whether women with GDM have a higher risk of preeclampsia. In the HAPO study, the risk of preeclampsia was between 13% and 37% higher, although not all possible confounding factors were corrected.

==Epidemiology==

The prevalence of GDM was 14.7%, 9.9%, and 14.4% in low-income countries (LIC), middle-income countries (MIC), and high-income countries (HIC) in 2021 by International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group&#x27;s criteria.
By 2021, the Global prevalence of hyperglycemia in pregnancy (HIP) as per IDF atlas will be 21.1 million people, accounting for 16.7% of births to women aged 20-49. These individuals may experience some form of hyperglycemia during pregnancy; 80.3% of these were due to GDM.

<text>The Roland Jupiter-6 (JP-6) is a discontinued synthesizer, manufactured and introduced by the Roland Corporation in January 1983.

==Background==
Although introduced as a less expensive ($2,500-$3,000 market price) alternative to the Roland Jupiter-8, its features include some capabilities not present in the JP-8, which makes the JP-6 a successor. The Jupiter-6 is widely considered a workhorse among polyphonic analog synthesizers, capable of producing a wide variety of sounds, such as ambient drones, pads, lead synthesizer lines, unison basses and techy blips and buzzes. It is renowned for its reliability and ease, but with sophisticated programmability.

The JP-6 has 12 analog oscillators (2 per voice), and is bitimbral, allowing its keyboard to be &quot;split&quot; into two sounds - one with 4 voices, and one with the remaining 2 voices (either &quot;Split 4/2&quot; or &quot;Split 2/4&quot; mode). &quot;Whole Mode&quot; is also available, dedicating all 6 voices to single (monotimbral) sound across the entire keyboard. Available waveforms include sawtooth, triangle, variable width pulse, square, and noise. Unusually, the JP-6 allows simultaneous selection of any or all of the waveforms in each of its two oscillator banks, an option not found on the JP-8. Oscillator sync and cross modulation are also available. &quot;Unison Mode&quot; allows all 12 oscillators to be triggered simultaneously by depressing a single key. Unison Mode can also be played polyphonically, with the number of oscillators triggered by each key determined by the number of keys held down. 

The JP-6 was among the first electronic instruments (alongside the Roland JX-3P and the Sequential Circuits Prophet-600) to feature MIDI, then a brand new technology. Sequential CEO Dave Smith demonstrated MIDI by connecting the Prophet to a Jupiter-6 during the January, 1983 Winter NAMM Show.

&quot;Europa,&quot; a popular firmware upgrade available from Synthcom Systems, adds a wide array of modern enhancements to the instrument&#x27;s MIDI implementation, user interface, patch memory, and most especially its arpeggiator, turning the Jupiter-6 into a contemporaneously adaptable instrument and unique composition tool.

<text>Rjukan () is a town in Tinn Municipality in Telemark county, Norway. The town is also the administrative centre of Tinn Municipality. The town is located in the Vestfjorddalen valley, between the lakes Møsvatn and Tinnsjå. The municipal council of Tinn declared town status for Rjukan in 1996. The town is located about to the west of the village of Miland and about to the northwest of the village of Tuddal (in Hjartdal Municipality).

The town has a population (2021) of 3,003 and a population density of .

The town was essentially &quot;built from scratch&quot; due to the industrial developments by Norsk Hydro in the 1910s and 1920s. It got its name from the Rjukan Falls west of the town. At its peak, Rjukan was a significant industrial center in Telemark. It became a World Heritage Site under the name Rjukan–Notodden Industrial Heritage Site on 5 July 2015. The town is perhaps best known for the heavy water sabotage operations at the local Vemork hydroelectric power plant during World War II.

Rjukan does not get any direct sunlight between September and March because the low sun is blocked by the tall Gaustatoppen mountain located directly to the south. In 2013, at a cost of , an art project called the built several large mirrors on the northern mountainside above the town to reflect the Sun down into the town during these dark months. The mirrors illuminate a small portion of the town square each day.

==History==

In 1906, the area which would become Rjukan consisted of only a few farmsteads, then called Saaheim, when Norsk Hydro began planning saltpeter (fertilizer) production in the area using the newly developed Birkeland–Eyde process. Rjukan was chosen because the Rjukan Falls, with a longest single fall, provided easy means of generating the large amounts of electricity that was required.

The Vemork hydroelectric power plant was built between 1907 and 1911, and was at the time the world&#x27;s largest hydroelectric power plant. A similar power plant was finished in Såheim in 1915. The power plants had a combined cost of more than , the equivalent of two annual national budgets at the time. With the factories, many houses for the factory workers also had to be built, in addition to a train station and a town hall. The town formally changed its name to Rjukan, and in 1920 reached a population of 8,350.

In 1934, Norsk Hydro built a hydrogen plant next to the Vemork power plant. A by-product of hydrogen production via water electrolysis was heavy water. It was the later Nobel Prize winner Odd Hassel who told Norsk Hydro that they were in fact in possession of the only regular heavy water production in Europe. At the time heavy water was believed to be a necessary component of an atomic bomb. When Norway came under German occupation during World War II, destroying this production became an important priority to the Allies. The facilities were sabotaged twice by the Norwegian resistance movement and bombed by allied forces.

After 1960, most of Norsk Hydro&#x27;s saltpeter production in Rjukan was transferred to factories at Herøya in Porsgrunn.

==Rjukan Church==
Rjukan Church was constructed of natural stone with a tower at the entrance to the southwest. The church was consecrated on 21 December 1915. The church was designed by the architects Carl and Jørgen Berner with a cruciform architectural floorplan. The altar image came into place in April 1917 and was painted by Bernhard Folkestad. Seven vaulted windows in the foundation wall have stained glass paintings by Torvald Moseid. In February 1965, while filming Heroes of Telemark, the gallery caught fire, and all combustible material in the church burnt down; only the walls remained. Asbjørn Stein was commissioned as the architect for the reconstruction. The tower was severely heat damaged and had to be largely rebuilt. Most of the walls were reused, and the church basically got the same exterior, but the interior was quite different. The church was ready in 1968 (consecrated on 28 April).

==Tourism==
Rjukan has a long history of tourism, beginning in the 19th century, then mostly focused on the Rjukan Falls. Later, the local resistance fighter and mountain guide Claus Helberg called Rjukan &quot;the cradle of tourism in Norway.&quot;

In 1811, royal geologist Jens Esmark &quot;discovered&quot; the Rjukan Falls, and enthusiastically reported to the Dano–Norwegian King Frederik VI that he had found &quot;the tallest of all known waterfalls, not just in Europe, but the whole world,&quot; which was completely wrong. Apparently, his assistant wrongly measured the total fall at tall. In reality, it has a total fall of , with a largest single fall of . , the tallest waterfall in Norway and the sixth tallest in the world, has a total fall of .

Nonetheless, the valley became a famous tourist sight for the European upper classes. During the 19th century, two inns served Norwegian and international guests. One of these guests was French author Jules Verne, who stayed in Rjukan in 1861 during his travels through Norway. During this time he wrote &quot;The Lottery Ticket&quot;, an adventure novel set in Telemark. In the novel, he describes the Rjukan Falls as &quot;one of the most spectacular waterfalls in Europe.&quot;

In addition to the waterfall, Rjukan had good terrain for skiing, and was a good starting point for hiking on the Hardangervidda plateau and Gaustatoppen.

In 1968, Krokan by the Rjukan waterfall became the Norwegian Trekking Association&#x27;s (DNT) first cabin. After the waterfall was harnessed for hydropower production, the hut was sold. Today it is re-opened and a part of the Unesco World Heritage site, situated by the main road from Rjukan (Tinn) to Vinje.

Today, tourism to Rjukan is focused on hiking opportunities, the local ski resort (one of the largest in Norway), and the Norwegian Industrial Workers Museum at Vemork. It is also considered one of the best ice climbing areas in Northern Europe because of the large number of waterfalls, and because the lack of sun gives ice consistently.

<doc id="697906" wikidata="Q3278281" url="?curid=697906" title="William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan">
<text>General William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan, ( – 17 July 1726) was a British Army officer, diplomat, politician and peer. He began his active military service during the Williamite War in Ireland in 1689 and ended it with the suppression of the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. A close associate and confidant of the Duke of Marlborough, he was also a diplomat and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1705 until 1716, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cadogan.

A strong supporter of the Hanoverian Succession, he took part in the suppression of the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion and succeeded Marlborough in 1722 as Master-General of the Ordnance and senior army commander.

==Early life==
Cadogan was born in Ireland around 1672, the son of the barrister Henry Cadogan and his wife Bridget Waller, daughter of the regicide Sir Hardress Waller. His family were Irish Protestants of Welsh descent. William&#x27;s grandfather William Cadogan served as an officer in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army.

He was one of five children, including two brothers Ambrose and Charles and two sisters: Frances, who died young, and Penelope, who married Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet. The family owned an estate at Liscarton in County Meath. His father served as High Sheriff of the county and also acquired property in County Limerick.

At the age of ten, he was sent to England to be educated at Westminster School, then run by Richard Busby. William&#x27;s father intended him to take up a law career like himself and, in March 1687, he was accepted as a student at Trinity College, Dublin. By this time he had developed into a tall, well-built young man.

==War in Ireland==
Midway through his studies, however, the Glorious Revolution took place in England in which the Protestant William of Orange seized the throne from the Catholic James II. In Ireland, the largely Catholic Irish Army remained loyal to James, while Protestants declared their support for William. The Protestants of Ulster formed an Army of the North, in which William Cadogan enlisted as a Cornet of Dragoons.

During 1689 he took part in the defence of Enniskillen which was one of only two places, along with Derry, which held out against the Jacobite Irish Army. Following the relief of Derry and Enniskillen by a large expeditionary force under Percy Kirke, Cadogan served with the Williamite troops for the remainder of the Irish War.

He was present at Dundalk Camp during the autumn of 1689, when the Army suffered large casualties from sickness. The following year he served at the Battle of the Boyne a major victory in which William III personally led his forces to victory over the Jacobites, leading to the capture of Dublin.

Later in the same year, he took part in the Siege of Cork where he first served with Marlborough, then an Earl. It appears that it was during this action that Cadogan, although only a junior officer, attracted the attention of his future commander by his conduct. 

Following the climatic victory at the Siege of Limerick in 1691 he continued to serve in Ireland for three years having decided to become a professional soldier rather than return to his law studies. In 1694, he purchased a Captaincy in Erle&#x27;s Regiment, which was then based in Flanders as part of the Nine Years&#x27; War with France.

In 1695, he took part in the Siege of Namur, an important Grand Alliance victory. Following the Peace of Ryswick he returned to Ireland, where in 1698 he became a major of the Inniskilling Dragoons.

==War of the Spanish Succession==
===Appointment===
In June 1701, Cadogan was selected as Quartermaster General to Marlborough on the latter&#x27;s appointment to command the British contingent in the Low Countries. Marlborough had been impressed by Cadogan&#x27;s administrative skills and his courage and the Siege of Cork a decade before. He had Cadogan promoted to Colonel, over the heads of more experienced officers. In July 1701 he accompanied both Marlborough and King William to Holland.

Britain had not yet officially entered the war, although military preparations were underway. He learnt to speak Dutch at this time, having already mastered French. During his time in Amsterdam, he fell in love with a Dutch heiress named Margaretta Munter. He married her two years later.

War broke out in 1702, following the accession of Queen Anne to the throne. Cadogan was made Marlborough&#x27;s chief of staff, soon becoming a trusted figure alongside other intimates including the General&#x27;s brother Charles Churchill, military secretary Adam de Cardonnel and the artillery commander Colonel Holcroft Blood. He also worked with the Dutch political representative Anthonie Heinsius. Cadogan soon demonstrated a flair for logistics and administration. He also came to head the extensive intelligence-gathering operations.

In early 1704 while travelling back to England, carrying important documents, his ship was attacked by a French Privateer. Fearing the seizure of his secret papers, he threw them over the side into the sea. However, his ship managed to get away and safely into harbour. While in London he had an audience with Queen Anne.

===Blenheim===

During the campaign of 1704, he was one of the few entrusted with the truth of Marlborough&#x27;s march from the Spanish Netherlands to the Danube and played a major role in the organisation of the March to the Danube. He wrote &quot;This march has hardly left me time to eat or sleep&quot;.

He fought at the battles of the Schellenberg and Blenheim. Shortly after he was promoted to brigadier general and became Marlborough&#x27;s chief of staff.

===Ramillies===
He commanded the army&#x27;s scouting part which located the French army on the morning of Ramillies, and acted as a senior messenger for Marlborough during the battle, recalling Orkney&#x27;s British infantry from their diversionary attack on the French right flank to assault the French centre around Ramillies itself.

In August 1706 Cadogan was captured while scouting enemy positions and taken as a prisoner to Tournai. Marlborough was distressed when he heard that he was missing, claiming &quot;I shall not be quiet till I know his fate&quot;. Within two days an exchange had been agreed upon, with Cadogan being swapped with a French General captured at Ramillies.

At Oudenarde he commanded the allied advance guard, which established crossings over the River Scheldt. In 1706 he was promoted to major general and commanded the forces which broke through the French left towards the end of the battle.

===Malplaquet===
In 1709 he was promoted to lieutenant general. He fought at Malplaquet, and was wounded in the neck at the siege of Mons, but quickly recovered. At the end of 1709 Cadogan was appointed as a Lieutenant of the Tower of London. During the breaking of the lines of Ne Plus Ultra, he again commanded the allied advance guard, and established a bridgehead across the lines prior to Marlborough&#x27;s arrival with the main army.

==Exile==
After Marlborough&#x27;s dismissal from his posts at the end of 1711 Cadogan remained with the army, but refused to return with it when Britain withdrew from the war in 1712, going into voluntary exile with the Duke. In doing so he lost his rank, positions and emoluments under the crown. He was strongly opposed to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, agreed by the Tory Government, siding with the opposition Whigs who called for &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot;.

During Marlborough&#x27;s voluntary exile during the last years of Queen Anne&#x27;s reign, Cadogan accompanied him, and often acted as a go-between to maintain Marlborough&#x27;s links with Britain. When the Hanoverian King George I succeeded in 1714, he reinstated Cadogan to his military offices. Marlborough was reappointed commander-in-chief, although as his deputy Cadogan had increasingly to take on much of the Duke&#x27;s workload.

Cadogan was rewarded with the post of Ambassador to the Dutch Republic. He was tasked with restoring the relationship with Britain&#x27;s recent ally which had been damaged by the country&#x27;s sudden withdrawal from the war. Cadogan oversaw negotiations for a fresh treaty which was concluded the following year.

==Jacobite Rebellion==
In 1715 he replaced the Duke of Argyll in command of the army putting down a Jacobite Rebellion. A major rising had broken out in Autumn 1715 in the Highlands of Scotland. Argyll as the senior Scottish commander led the initial attempts to contain the Jacobites from his position at Stirling Castle. In November Argyll fought an intense but indecisive battle against the Jacobites at the Battle of Sherrifmuir, after which it was decided in London that he was insufficiently committed to the Hanoverian cause.

Cadogan was then sent north by Marlborough to provide effective leadership. He brought with him many of the 6,000 Dutch troops supplied as part of a treaty commitment, whose shipping to Britain he had overseen. During his absence from The Hague, the diplomat Horatio Walpole fulfilled his duties there.

Cadogan found that Argyll remained reluctant to move against the Jacobites due to the wintery conditions. This continued even after James Stuart, who proclaimed himself to be King, arrived near Aberdeen in December.

Argyll and Cadogan worked together for a while, although the Duke no longer enjoyed the confidence of the government in London. Cadogan established better supply lines for the Army, personally took part in scouting operations, and organised the advance on the rebel capital at Perth. Rather than face a siege of the city, the Jacobites withdrew to Dundee. In February 1716, James abandoned the attempt to personally lead the rebellion in Scotland and sailed for the Continent.

Soon afterwards, Argyll resigned and went to London, turning over total command to Cadogan. He was shortly afterwards dismissed from all his military and political roles, amidst allegations that he had Jacobite sympathies. Cadogan&#x27;s task was to oversee continued military operations across northern Scotland, forcing the leading Clan chiefs to submit. In April Cadogan declared the rebellion to be over, and returned to London the following month. Marlborough was instrumental in securing him a peerage as a reward for his efforts during the campaign.

==Later life==
Cadogan was a Whig Member of Parliament for Woodstock from 1705 to 1716. On 21 June 1716, he was made Baron Cadogan of Reading, having recently purchased Caversham Park, Oxfordshire (now Berkshire) near that town. He was also made a Knight of the Thistle and, the following year, a member of the Privy Council. Also in 1717, he was promoted to full general. On 8 May 1718 George I made him 1st Earl Cadogan, of Oakley, co. Buckingham, Viscount Caversham, of Caversham, co. Oxford and Earl Cadogan. In later years he also served as Master of the Robes (1714–1726) and governor of the Isle of Wight (1715–1726).

When the Duke of Marlborough died in 1722, Cadogan walked at the head of the procession at his funeral. He succeeded his former commander as Master-General of the Ordnance (1722–1725). However, the Opposition&#x27;s staunch hostility towards him meant that he had lost any political influence several years before his death on 17 July 1726. Despite his closeness to Marlborough, he was much occupied in his later years with a lawsuit brought against him by Marlborough&#x27;s widow. He was himself rather litigious by nature, even engaging in a bitter lawsuit against his own sister Penelope over her son&#x27;s inheritance.

==Family==
He married Margaret Cecilia Munter in April 1704 at The Hague. They had two daughters: Sarah (born 18 September 1705), who married Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Margaret (born 21 February 1707), who married Charles John Bentinck, fourth son of William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland. With no male heir the earldom became extinct. His younger brother Charles, who had married Elizabeth Sloane, the daughter of the noted Irish-born physician and landowner Sir Hans Sloane, inherited the barony by special remainder, passing it down through his son.

<doc id="697907" wikidata="Q17105589" url="?curid=697907" title="Royalty trust">
<text>A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining. However, unlike most corporations, its profits are not taxed at the corporate level provided a certain high percentage (e.g. 90%) of profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. The dividends are then taxed as personal income. This system, similar to real estate investment trusts, effectively avoids the double taxation of corporate income.

Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens is often credited with creating the first royalty trust in 1979; however Marine Petroleum Trust (Marps) was created in 1956, twenty three years earlier.

==Characteristics of royalty trusts==
Royalty trusts typically own oil or natural gas wells, the mineral rights of wells, or mineral rights on other types of properties. An outside company must perform the actual operation of the oil or gas field, or mine, and the trust itself, in the United States, may have no employees. Shares of the trust generally trade on the public stock markets, but the trust itself is typically overseen by a trust officer in a bank.

They are a powerful investment tool for people who wish to invest directly in extraction of petroleum or mining of other materials, but who do not have the resources or risk tolerance to buy their own well or mine. Additionally, since trusts often own numerous individual wells, oil fields, or mines, they represent a convenient way for the average investor to diversify investments across a number of properties. Also, since commodities are considered a hedge against inflation, the popularity of royalty trusts as investments rises as interest rates rise, and their shares often rise as a result.

These trusts often attract investors with their relatively high yields; in 2007, their distributions were often in the 10 to 15 percent annual range. This makes the shares sensitive to interest rates, as share prices are likely to decline in periods of rising interest rates, and to rise when interest rates fall. Additionally, royalty trusts in the United States and Canada usually involve oil and gas fields or mines which are at or past their production peak, and will gradually decline in output as well as revenue; however, the infrastructure to develop them has already been built, so that an investor can expect a reasonably steady income stream.

In addition to allowing investors to achieve high distribution returns, especially during periods of low interest rates, royalty trusts allow investors to speculate directly on commodities such as gas, oil, or iron ore without having to buy futures contracts, or use the other investment vehicles traditionally associated with commodities—since the trusts trade like stocks. During times when a commodity price is rising, the share value as well as the dividend return of a trust engaging in production of that commodity will rise as well.

==Canadian royalty trusts (CanRoy)==
Royalty trusts are found mainly in Canada and the United States; there is also one in Germany. Canadian royalty trusts, called &quot;Canroys&quot; or &quot;CanRoys&quot;, typically trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while some of the larger trusts also trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Canroys usually offer higher yields than U.S. trusts; for non-Canadian investors, this higher yield is reduced by the 15% foreign tax withholding that is absent in the U.S. trusts.

The most significant difference between Canadian and U.S. royalty trusts involves their legal status in their respective countries. In the U.S., trusts are not allowed to acquire additional properties, once they are formed. Since they are restricted to their original properties – for example, a group of oil fields or natural-gas-bearing rock formations—they can be expected to be depleted over time, the royalties they pay out will correspondingly decline, and eventually the trust will be dissolved. In Canada, trusts may be actively managed, and run as businesses. They may have employees, issue new shares, borrow money, acquire additional properties, and may manage the resources themselves.

Bell Canada Enterprises corporate unit Yellow Pages Group converted to Yellow Pages Income Fund on 25 June 2003, making it the &quot;first high-profile conversion to the trust structure&quot;. Their income fund raised &quot;$1-billion in the process&quot;.

According to a 2012 article in &quot;Canadian Energy Law,&quot;

Richardson argued that by 2012 foreign asset income trusts (FAITs) had revived interest regarding income trusts in Canada. Because FAITs involve assets outside Canadian borders, they are &quot;not subject to traditional Specified Investment Flow-Through (SIFT) rules&quot;.

===Hallowe&#x27;en massacre===

In 2006 $70 billion of new trust conversions were announced. The largest was proposed in September 2006 when Bell Canada Enterprise BCE announced its intention to convert its Bell Canada subsidiary to a CanRoy trust thereby saving the corporation $800 million in tax by 2008. The royalty trusts were increasingly popular because they do not pay corporate tax, rather they &quot;pay out most of their income in distributions to unit holders, who then pay tax on those distributions&quot;. On 31 October 2006 then-Finance Minister Jim Flaherty made his now famous proposal to introduce new rules — later known as Specified Investment Flow-Through(SIFT) rules — nicknamed the &quot;Halloween Massacre&quot;. Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper — who was sworn into office 6 February 2006 after winning against the incumbent Paul Martin — the Canadian federal government announced the elimination of the loophole that placed over 250 income trusts at a tax advantage over other corporations. Starting in 2011 &quot;income trusts, with the exception of those focused on real estate, would be subject to a tax on trust distributions&quot; at the full 31.5% rate. Existing trusts would have a four-year transition period (2007 to 2011) whereas newer trusts such as the proposed Bell Canada trust would be applicable in 2007. What prompted the move was that the trusts were costing the Canadian government upwards of $500,000,000 each year in lost revenue. Flaherty described the conversion of corporations into royalty trusts as &quot;a growing trend to corporate tax avoidance&quot; which was hurting the Canadian economy and defended his response as &quot;measured&quot;. If the trend of trusts conversions was not stopped, it was estimated that the Canadian federal and provincial governments would lose &quot;$1 billion annually in tax revenue&quot;.

Immediately after the announcement share prices of the trusts dropped. Penn West Exploration. then- Penn West Energy Trust) — still referred to as known as Penn West Petroleum in the media — In an interview in January, 2013 Matt Donohue, an analyst at UBS AG in Calgary, argued that the growth-and-income model was &quot;bruised&quot; not &quot;broken&quot; with income trusts converting back into a corporate structure. With the increased use of horizontal drilling in the energy industry, energy trust adopt a hybrid policy that promised both &quot;per-share growth and sustainable income for their shareholders&quot;. This model is least lucrative in periods of weak commodity prices.

Since the announcement of the Canadian &quot;Tax Fairness Plan&quot; approximately 90% of Canadian Royalty Trusts (CANROY&#x27;s) have either converted to corporations, merged with other companies, or simply liquidated. While the Tax Fairness Plan did not require a conversion to corporate status most companies found it beneficial to do so. After conversion most companies were required to slash their dividend payouts to reflect the new level of taxation they would be required to pay.

<text>The Roland SH-1000, introduced in 1973, was the first compact synthesizer produced in Japan, and the first synthesizer produced by Roland. It resembles a home organ more than a commercial synth, with coloured tabs labelled with descriptions of its presets and of the &quot;footage&quot; of the divide-down oscillator system used in its manually editable synthesizer section. It produced electronic sounds that many professional musicians sought after whilst being easier to obtain and transport than its Western equivalents.

The synthesizer has 10 simple preset voices combined with a manually editable section which can be manually tweaked around to create new interesting sounds. No user program memory is available. Its effects include white noise generator, portamento, octave transposition, two low frequency oscillators and a random note generator.

Even with a single oscillator, it sounds like there are several thanks to the 8 sub-osc keys. The ninth is the (white or pink) noise.

<doc id="697913" wikidata="Q2080305" url="?curid=697913" title="Tony Kanal">
<text>Tony Ashwin Kanal (born 27 August 1970) is a British-American musician, songwriter and record producer who is known for his work as the bassist and co-writer for the rock bands No Doubt and Dreamcar. His career outside of performing includes production and songwriting credits with artists such as Pink, Weezer, Elan Atias and No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stefani&#x27;s solo work.

==Early life==
Kanal was born in Kingsbury, in northwest London, England. Kanal&#x27;s father, Gulab was from Sukkur (in present-day Sindh, Pakistan) and grew up in Delhi, India and his mother, Lajwanti &quot;Lajju&quot;, was originally from Mumbai (then known as Bombay). His parents immigrated to London, where Kanal was born. While most of his early years were spent in the British capital city, Kanal and his family briefly lived in Toronto, Ontario and Munster, Indiana, before returning to London. At age 11, his family moved to the United States, settling in Anaheim, Orange County, California. Kanal attended South Junior High School and Anaheim High School. Upon entering seventh grade, Kanal joined his junior high school concert band. Kanal&#x27;s father suggested that Kanal learn to play the saxophone because it was his favorite instrument. In tenth grade, Kanal learned how to play the electric bass guitar with help from his schoolmate, David J. Carpenter.

==Career==
===Early beginnings and No Doubt===
After being invited to No Doubt&#x27;s first official club show on 14 March 1987, by original drummer and fellow Anaheim High School alumnus Chris Webb, Kanal joined the band as its bassist at age 16. After high school, Kanal enrolled at California State University, Fullerton to major in psychology.

In 1991, No Doubt signed with Interscope Records and began recording their first full-length album. Their self-titled debut was released in 1992; that same year, they embarked on three U.S. van tours, playing clubs and theaters. Over the next decade, No Doubt released the follow-up albums &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; (1995), &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; (1995), &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; (2000), &quot;Rock Steady&quot; (2001), as well as two compilation albums, &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot; (2003) and &quot;Everything in Time: B-Sides, Rarities, Remixes&quot; (2004). The band toured the world and earned several awards, including two Grammy Awards and 5 MTV Music Video Awards.

===2004–2014: No Doubt hiatus, writing, and producing===
In 2004, after touring the U.S. to promote &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, No Doubt went on hiatus. During this time, Kanal began producing and writing outside of the band. The same year, Kanal produced three songs for the soundtrack to &quot;50 First Dates&quot;. Also in 2004, Kanal produced and co-wrote three tracks on Gwen Stefani&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; Kanal then produced Elan Atias&#x27;s debut album &quot;Together as One&quot;, released in June 2006. Kanal worked with Gwen Stefani for her follow-up solo album &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;, released in 2006.

He created several remixes, including ones of Stefani&#x27;s &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; and Gang of Four&#x27;s &quot;Ether&quot;. Kanal produced the song &quot;Rent&quot; for the ska punk band Pepper&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;No Shame&quot;.

In 2008, he collaborated on two songs titled &quot;Sober&quot; and &quot;Funhouse&quot; with Pink for her album &quot;Funhouse&quot;. Kanal also co-wrote the song &quot;Smart Girls&quot; for Weezer&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Hurley&quot;.

In 2010, Kanal co-wrote, produced, and performed bass on the track &quot;Kiss You Up&quot;, recorded by Barbadian artist Shontelle for her album &quot;No Gravity&quot;.

With Stefani promoting her second solo album, No Doubt began work on an album without her and planned to complete it after Stefani&#x27;s tour was finished. In March 2008, the band started making posts concerning the progression of the album on their official fan forum. Stefani made a post on 28 March 2008 stating that songwriting had begun but was slow on her end because she was pregnant with her second child.

The band toured in 2009 for their first full-fledged band tour in nearly five years. The North American 2009 Summer Tour was the band&#x27;s largest tour, playing over 50 shows.

In 2009, No Doubt made an appearance on the television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, playing a fictional band named Snowed Out in the episode &quot;Valley Girls&quot;. They performed their cover version of the Adam and the Ants song &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;. In 2010, the band performed at the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington, D.C., to celebrate the life&#x27;s work of Paul McCartney. Their performance was attended by President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.

In 2012, No Doubt released &quot;Push and Shove&quot;, their latest release. They performed seven sold-out shows in Los Angeles at the Universal Amphitheater. In 2014 and 2015, they played the Global Citizens Festivals in New York City and Washington, D.C., and headlined music festivals in the United States.

===2014–present: Dreamcar and other bands===
In 2014, Kanal and No Doubt bandmates Tom Dumont and Adrian Young, along with Davey Havok of AFI, formed the band Dreamcar. They released their debut self-titled album through Columbia Records in 2017 and toured the U.S. to support it, including performances at the Coachella Festival.

In October 2018, Kanal joined Danny Elfman during the encore of his three &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; shows at the Hollywood Bowl to play Oingo Boingo&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot;. On 31 October, Kanal performed a set of eight Red Hot Chili Peppers songs with musicians Adam Levine, Chad Smith, Andrew Watt, and Darren Criss at Maroon 5&#x27;s annual Halloween party in Los Angeles.

In December 2018, Kanal played bass for The Offspring on their Australian festival headline tour. In January 2019, Kanal joined the band for their tour in Japan.

==Personal life==
Kanal dated bandmate Gwen Stefani from 1987 to 1994. They continued to have a creative relationship after they broke up which led to many of No Doubt&#x27;s songs, most notably &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;. A decade later, Stefani co-wrote her song &quot;Cool&quot; about their relationship as friends for her 2004 debut solo album &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot;

Kanal is married to American home designer Erin Lokitz. On 24 January 2011, their first daughter, Coco Reese Lakshmi Kanal was born. On 22 November 2013, their second daughter, Saffron Rose Kiran Kanal was born.

<text>E.C. Dahls Brewery (&quot;E.C. Dahls Bryggeri&quot;) is a brewery and soft drink factory based in Trondheim, Norway.

==History==

E.C. Dahls Brewery was founded in 1856 by Erich Christian Dahl (1814–1882), a local businessman and consul-general from Trondheim. He was the son of Erich Dahl (1774-1821) Christine Lyche (1776-1861). His parents had been the owners of an import-export business and shipping company. In 1851, Erich Christian Dahl had bought the Sugarhouse (&quot;Sukkerhuset&quot;) in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim, where there had been a sugar refinery since 1754. Sukkerhuset was rebuilt for brewing. The brewery stayed in the building until 1984.

The first bottle of Bayerøl, a Munich-style dunkel, was sold in 1857. In 1910, the plant began to produce soft drinks at the brewery as well. Bayerøl was the most important type of beer until the early 20th century when Dahls Pils, a pilsener took over as the most popular beer.

In 1966, it was merged with Trondheim Aktie Brewery (&quot;Trondhjems Aktiebryggeri&quot;), which was founded in 1899 and Trondheim Brewery (&quot;Trondhjems Bryggeri&quot;) which dated to 1919. E.C. Dahls Bryggeri is now owned by Ringnes, part of the Group Carlsberg AS.
==E.C. Dahl&#x27;s Foundation==
E.C. Dahl&#x27;s Foundation (&quot;E.C. Dahls Stiftelse i Trondheim&quot;) was opened in Trondheim during 1908 with funding from the estate of Erich Christian Dahl. The Foundation originally established a hospital for newborn children and infant care. The Foundation now provides support in relation to different types of disabilities. The Foundation&#x27;s Art Nouveau building in the Kalvskinnet area of Trondheim is now used by the Trøndelag Art Center (&quot;Trøndelag Kunstnersenter&quot;) .

<doc id="697926" wikidata="Q1995969" url="?curid=697926" title="Emma Frost">
<text>Emma Grace Frost is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne, the character first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #129 (January 1980). She belongs to a subspecies of humans called mutants who are born with superhuman abilities. Her mutation grants her high-level telepathic abilities and the power to turn into organic diamond. Emma Frost has evolved from a supervillain and foe of the X-Men to becoming a superhero and one of the team&#x27;s most central members and leaders. The character has also been known as the White Queen of the Hellfire Club.

Emma Frost has been described as one of Marvel&#x27;s most notable and powerful female heroes, being labeled as a femme fatale.

Since her original introduction in comics, Frost has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise such as trading cards. In particular, she was portrayed by Finola Hughes in the television pilot &quot;Generation X&quot;. Subsequently, she appeared in the films &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, portrayed by Tahyna Tozzi, and &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, portrayed by January Jones.

==Development==

=== Concept and creation ===
Chris Claremont was inspired to create the Hellfire Club after seeing the episode &quot;A Touch of Brimstone&quot; from the television show &quot;The Avengers&quot;. Spy duo John Steed and Emma Peel infiltrate a criminal and hedonistic underground society. Emma Frost was specifically inspired by the character of Emma Peel portrayed by actress Diana Rigg. In the episode, Rigg famously dons a provocative corset, collar, and boots and becomes the &quot;Queen of Sin&quot;, which was incorporated into the design of Frost.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Emma Frost was born in Boston, Massachusetts to the wealthy Winston Frost and Hazel Frost. She is the third of four children: her siblings are Christian, Adrienne, and Cordelia. Winston was cold, ruthless, and domineering, often imposing impossibly high standards, while Hazel abused prescription drugs to cope with the household tensions. Emma had no emotional support from her parents or her sisters, but got along with her brother Christian.
At her school, Frost was ruthlessly bullied by her peers but found support in her teacher, Ian Kendall. When her telepathic powers manifested, Frost was able to read the minds of others and glean information. Frost became a tutor to the other students and Ian recommended that she become a teacher, something Frost&#x27;s father refused. On her way home from school one day, Frost&#x27;s car broke down and Ian gave her a ride home. After reading his thoughts and learning that he thought she was beautiful and intelligent, Frost kissed him. Her sister Adrienne recorded it and her father used the evidence to get Ian fired. Frost began to fight back by blackmailing her father. Intrigued by her actions, Winston offered her the family fortune but Frost rejected his offer and decided to make her own way in life.

After a period of homelessness, Frost met and fell in love with a young man named Troy, who agreed to let her live with him. She learned that he owed a large amount of money to a local mobster named Lucien. To save Troy&#x27;s life, Frost agreed to participate in a fake kidnapping scheme in an attempt to extort the remainder of Troy&#x27;s debt from her father. However, this soon turned into a real kidnapping and Troy was killed while valiantly attempting to save Frost from an enraged Lucien. Using her powers, Frost turned the thugs against one another inside an illusion, causing an imaginary gunfight to break out, and the panicked, supposed last survivor to free her. After Emma&#x27;s escape, she anonymously called the police and they were all taken into custody with no memory of her.

Frost took the ransom money and enrolled at Empire State University. There, she began to learn about mutants for the first time and met fellow telepath Astrid Bloom who became her friend and mentor. Frost later learned that Astrid had been secretly manipulating events. Furious, she attacked Astrid telepathically and left her comatose. Frost was later invited to the Hellfire Club, an underground elite society. Frost discovered the plans of Edward Buckman and Steven Lang to destroy all mutants. Alongside Sebastian Shaw, Lourdes Chantel, and Harry Leland, Frost battled Lang&#x27;s Sentinels. Frost killed Buckman and the Council of the Chosen, then – along with Shaw – took control of the Hellfire Club, and set themselves up as Lords Cardinal of the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club.

===White Queen of the Hellfire Club===
As White Queen of the Hellfire Club, Frost held many titles, one of which was chair of the board and CEO of Frost International, which helped to fund the activities of the Lords Cardinal. Frost also became the chair of the board of trustees and the headmistress of the Massachusetts Academy, a school for mutants which served as a counterpoint to Professor Charles Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters. Frost and the club&#x27;s agents later attempted to recruit Kitty Pryde for the Massachusetts Academy, and captured (and Frost personally tortured) several members of the X-Men, including Storm, Colossus, Wolverine, and Phoenix. Frost engaged Phoenix in a psychic battle in which she was overpowered and on the verge of being killed. Frost launched a last-minute attack that led the X-Men to believe she had committed suicide, though in truth, she was comatose and recovering from Phoenix&#x27;s attack under the care of Shaw. In another encounter with the Hellfire Club, Frost telepathically forced Pryde&#x27;s parents to transfer from Xavier&#x27;s to the Massachusetts Academy. She then switched minds with Storm to defeat the X-Men from within their own ranks. However, the process was soon reversed and the two were restored to their respective bodies. She was later temporarily rendered comatose by Mastermind.

===The Hellions===
During her time with the Hellfire Club, Frost continued to run the Massachusetts Academy and mentored the mutant team known as the Hellions. Frost attempted to recruit several gifted youngsters to her cause: Firestar, Doug Ramsey and Pryde, all of which resulted in altercations. Alongside the Hellions, Frost encountered the Hellions&#x27; rival team, Xavier&#x27;s New Mutants, several times. When the New Mutants were later killed and resurrected by the Beyonder, they were left traumatized and withdrawn. Frost offered her assistance in telepathically restoring them to their former selves. She then coerced their headmaster Magneto into allowing them to join the Massachusetts Academy. With Shaw and Selene, Frost invited Magneto to join the Hellfire Club. Alongside the Hellfire Club, Frost battled the High Evolutionary&#x27;s forces to rescue Magma, helped Magneto search for the New Mutants when they had gone missing, encountered the effects of the Inferno, and eventually formed an alliance with Selene and Magneto to oust Shaw from the inner circle.

===Losing the Hellions===
When the time traveling mutant Trevor Fitzroy unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Frost and her Hellions, Frost placed herself in a psychic coma to survive the ordeal. Her students however, were not as lucky and were killed by Fitzroy to fuel his time portals. Frost later awakened in the Xavier Academy. Disoriented, she switched minds with Iceman and, refusing to believe the X-Men when they told her that the Hellions are dead, escaped. She was overcome with grief and guilt when she discovered that her students are indeed dead, and briefly became suicidal. Professor Xavier consoled Frost and was able to coax her to switch back.

===Generation X===
Frost later teamed up with the X-Men to defeat the Phalanx, and in the process, rescued a select group of teenage mutants who became a superhero team known as Generation X, to whom Frost and Banshee became mentors at the reopened Massachusetts Academy. After Frost&#x27;s business ventures took a bad turn, she sought help from her estranged sister Adrienne who was a psychometrist. Adrienne offered financial assistance but secretly plotted against Frost and planted a bomb at the school, resulting in the death of Synch. Frost tracked down and killed Adrienne, but after returning to the academy, grew increasingly distant from her students in an effort to hide her crime. When the students learned what Frost did, the students became estranged from her, and Generation X disbanded.

===Joining and leading the X-Men===
In dealing with the emotional fallout from the murder of her sister, Frost travelled to the mutant haven island of Genosha, where she taught at a mutant school until a genocidal Sentinel attack killed most of the island&#x27;s inhabitants; Frost survived due to the sudden manifestation of her secondary mutation: the power to transform herself into a flexible, near-invulnerable, diamond-like substance. After being rescued Frost joined the X-Men and took on a teaching position at Xavier Institute. She mentored the Stepford Cuckoos, a group of telepathic quintuplets who quickly became her prized pupils. Frost and the Cuckoos proved themselves when they helped fight and defeat Cassandra Nova. As a member of the X-Men, Frost began counseling over Cyclops&#x27;s marital issues with Jean Grey. She quickly developed feelings for him but Cyclops initially rejected her advances.

As Scott Summers confided more in Emma, the two engaged in a psychic affair. While quelling a riot at the school, Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos was killed and the others rejected Frost&#x27;s mentorship, blaming her for the death. They attempted to get revenge by telepathically contacting Jean about Frost&#x27;s and Cyclops&#x27;s psychic affair. In the aftermath of the riot, Jean caught Frost and Summers in bed together in their minds. In a rage, Jean unleashed reignited Phoenix powers and psychically humiliated Frost. Afterward, Frost was found physically shattered in her diamond form. As Bishop and Sage investigated the crime, Jean used increasingly growing Phoenix powers to reassemble Frost&#x27;s body, acknowledging that Frost had genuinely fallen in love with Scott. Scott confronted Jean and demands that she read his mind; Jean finally complied, only to discover that Scott and Emma never engaged in any physical contact, though Emma had offered it. Revived, Frost was able to name her attempted murderer: Esme of the Stepford Cuckoos who had mind-controlled fellow student Angel Salvadore into shooting Frost with a diamond bullet, under the direction of Xorn.

Scott was devastated by Jean&#x27;s death, and considered leaving the X-Men once more. It was revealed in the &quot;Here Comes Tomorrow&quot; storyline that, had he done so, it would have led to an apocalyptic alternate future. To prevent this, a resurrected, future-version of Jean used her powers as the White Phoenix of the Crown and telepathically reached through time to tell Cyclops it was ok to move on, declaring all she ever did was &quot;die&quot; on him and he deserved a chance to &quot;live&quot;. Scott began a real relationship with Emma, kissing her physically for the first time by Jean&#x27;s grave. The new relationship between Emma and Scott led to problems between them and the rest of the X-Men, all of whom believed that the pair were doing Jean&#x27;s memory a disservice. Frost became co-headmistress with Cyclops and adviser to a new team of Hellions. She developed an antagonistic relationship with Pryde as fellow teachers and Rachel Grey, however, a truce was reached when Frost offered to help hone Rachel&#x27;s telepathic abilities.

===Decimation===
Following the &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, the student population drastically decreased, and Frost, without consulting Cyclops, decided to revamp the entire workings of the school.

===Phoenix Warsong===
During the 2006 miniseries &quot;X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong&quot;, it was revealed that Frost&#x27;s ova were the genetic templates used to clone thousands of identical female telepaths, five of which are the Stepford Cuckoos. The encapsulated offspring began to refer to Frost as &quot;mother&quot; – a title which she later accepted. In the end, the Phoenix (inhabiting the body of Celeste Cuckoo) destroyed the thousands of additional clones, Frost was pained by the loss of her cloned children and declared revenge against the Phoenix.

===Astonishing X-Men===
In the series &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, a flashback showed that Frost&#x27;s survival of the destruction of Genosha was due to Nova creating Frost&#x27;s secondary mutation as part of a scheme to infiltrate the X-Men as a sleeper agent. The guilt ridden Frost created psychic manifestations of a new Hellfire Club and proceeded to take down the X-Men one by one by showing them their deepest fears. Later on it was revealed that Frost&#x27;s survivor&#x27;s guilt is being exacerbated by Nova who had placed a glimmer of her mind in Frost&#x27;s before being trapped in the body of Stuff, and that Nova had even tricked Frost into thinking she had been complicit in the destruction of Genosha. Kitty, with aid from Cyclops, Blindfold, Hisako Ichiki, and Frost herself eventually prevented Nova from transferring her mind into Hisako. Everyone present was then suddenly teleported onto a S.W.O.R.D. ship headed towards the Breakworld. The arc concluded with Kitty trapped in the bullet heading towards Earth and the team trying to find various ways to save the Earth and Kitty. Frost kept in telepathic contact with Kitty, trying to reassure her, even offering to psionically sedate her. Kitty sacrificed herself, phasing the bullet through Earth. In the aftermath, the X-Men were uncertain of Kitty&#x27;s fate, believing her to either be dead or at least phased into part of the runaway bullet. Frost was devastated.

===Civil War===
During the 2006–2007 storyline &quot;Civil War&quot;, Frost, during a conversation with Iron Man, announced that the Xavier Institute and the X-Men would not support the Superhuman Registration Act and would remain neutral, as she feared that the registration of mutants would put them in more danger.

===Messiah Complex===
During the 2007–2008 storyline &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;, Frost was part of the team that investigated the detection of a new mutant in Alaska. She also defended the X-Men from the Marauders and the telepathy of Sinister and Exodus. Frost was last seen with Cyclops&#x27;s team of X-Men looking for Cable and then tracking down the Marauders with the Cuckoos. Later when X-Force arrived at the Marauders&#x27; hideout, Frost took out Harpoon. During the final battle on Muir Island, she faced Exodus, stalemating him in a telepathic duel, until Dust was able to enter his body and scour his lungs with her sand form, incapacitating him.

===Divided We Stand===
In the 2008 storyline &quot;Divided We Stand&quot;, Frost and Scott vacationed in the Savage Land but soon left to answer a distress call made by Archangel from San Francisco. The couple saved San Francisco from an out of control Martinique Jason. Afterwards, the Mayor of San Francisco welcomed the X-Men with open arms as their new super-hero team and Frost and Cyclops sent out a telepathic message to all remaining mutants throughout the world, informing them that San Francisco was considered a sanctuary for the remaining mutants in the world.

===Manifest Destiny===
In the 2008–2009 storyline &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, a new anti-mutant group calling themselves the &quot;Hellfire Cult&quot; appeared in the Bay Area, committing various anti-mutant hate crimes. They are led by Frost&#x27;s former pupil, Empath, as well as a mysterious red-haired dominatrix telepath who calls herself the Red Queen. After Empath discloses his experience of lusting after Frost during his days at the Massachusetts Academy, the dominatrix takes on Frost&#x27;s appearance. While investigating the Hellfire Cult&#x27;s base, Cyclops is seduced by the Red Queen. Later while at a Dazzler concert, Scott reveals that the Red Queen is none other than Madelyne Pryor.

Frost also expresses doubts about whether or not she deserves to be an X-Man, only to have veteran X-Man Wolverine assure her that she has earned her place on the team. Later, when Xavier attempts to warn Cyclops about his recent encounter with Sinister, Frost manages to enter the Professor&#x27;s mind undetected. During the course of their encounter, Frost forces Xavier to relive each of his mistakes and morally ambiguous decisions made under altruistic pretenses. It is also revealed that while Frost is just as angry with Xavier as Cyclops is, she also wants to help him move on with his life. Frost points the Professor in a new direction by forcing him to relive Moira MacTaggert&#x27;s death and reminding him of her last words.

===Secret Invasion===
In the 2008 storyline &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, Frost is seen fighting the Skrulls in San Francisco during the invasion. There, the Skrulls set up a telepathy-blocking &quot;wall&quot; throughout the globe. Emma channels the Cuckoos&#x27; telepathy into her own using Cerebra in an attempt to locate the source of the psi-blockade but is left comatose. The Cuckoos tell Cyclops that Emma is dead, unaware that Emma&#x27;s telepathic mind is continuing to battle the psychic team of Skrulls. Setting a series of traps through misdirection, Emma manages to break free and shut down the psi-blockade. Following the Skrulls&#x27; defeat, she is introduced as a member of a secret cabal, consisting of herself, Norman Osborn, Doctor Doom, Loki, Namor and the Hood, who are manipulating events in their favor.

===Dark Reign===
In the 2008–2009 storyline &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, Frost, after waking from a vision about the Sentry, is invited to join Osborn&#x27;s Cabal. At the meeting, it is revealed that she and Prince Namor share a romantic history. During her days as the White Queen, Sebastian Shaw sent Frost to convince Namor to join the Hellfire Club. Instead, Namor took her to his kingdom and they began a relationship. Believing Frost to have betrayed him for Namor, Shaw sent a reprogrammed sentinel to Atlantis, attacking the two and destroying the kingdom. When Namor confronted Shaw for his treachery, Sage took a telepathic hold of Frost, erasing her memories of Namor, who vowed revenge on Shaw. In the present, Frost reveals that after her initial battle with the Phoenix she pieced her memories of Namor back together. She makes a pact with him, seducing Shaw and using her telepathy to make Namor believe she has executed him, while secretly telepathically incapacitating Shaw. Per their deal, Namor vows to protect mutant-kind as his own people, while Frost, more determined to fill her role as a leader of mutant-kind, contacts Scott to have Shaw captured by the X-Men for &quot;crimes against mutant-kind.&quot; Approaching him later in his cell, Frost reveals that she has captured Shaw for Namor and on the basis that the Sentinels he commissioned were ones later used by Cassandra to destroy Genosha. She sentences him to remember nothing but the faces of the Genoshan victims using her telepathy.

====Sisterhood of Mutants====
The Red Queen, along with her magically powered Sisterhood of Mutants attack the X-Men with the end goal of locating Jean&#x27;s corpse. Lady Mastermind ambushes Frost nullifying her mind with a mixture of magical and psychic chaff. Frost has a vision telling her to prepare for future events involving the Phoenix Force and eventually breaks free. She defeats the Mastermind sisters and later attacks the rest of the Sisterhood at their base with the X-Men.

====Dark X-Men====
Frost is appointed to lead Osborn&#x27;s new team of &quot;Dark X-Men&quot;. Each member is hand-picked by Norman but Frost has Namor added to the team for her own reasons. The team debuts to the public as the official &quot;X-Men&quot; maintaining high public approval through Osborn&#x27;s careful media strategy. They oust the original X-Men, portraying them as a dangerous militia. Meanwhile, Frost discovers that Osborn is working with the Dark Beast, torturing apprehended mutants and feeding their powers into a machine that empowers Weapon Omega. Cyclops sends X-Force on a strategic evacuation of the mutant prisoners, resulting in a planned confrontation with the Dark X-Men. As the teams prepare to face off, Frost then reveals her role as a double agent, defeating the Dark X-Men with Namor&#x27;s assistance. She extends an invitation to Cloak and Dagger to join the true X-Men as they teleport to the newly created island base Utopia. Upon learning of this, Norman orders the Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men to go after Frost, Namor, and Scott. During the final battle, Frost distracts the godlike Sentry by separating the Void persona from Bob Reynolds&#x27;s persona. Doing so allows the Sentry to regain control and flee the battle, however, Frost cannot contain the Void and it chases after the Sentry, though a sliver of it remains within her body. Frost is forced to remain in diamond form to prevent the sliver of the Void from utilizing her omega-level psychic abilities. Eventually it came to the decision to extract the Void. With Professor X&#x27;s aid, they bridged Cyclops&#x27;s mind to Frost. However, the Void instead took over his body, only for Scott to contain it within an inescapable prison in his mind.

===Necrosha===
Frost, Shaw and Donald Pierce are targeted by Selene for betraying her years ago in her plan to ascend to godhood. Additionally, Selene is also angry over Frost using the Black Queen moniker when she was leading the Dark X-Men. She resurrects the Hellions and sends them to attack and taunt Frost. Their appearance is enough, to leave Frost in a horrified state of shock and guilt. Once Selene&#x27;s inner circle appears on Utopia Frost recognizes Blink and stops Wolverine from killing Wither. However, in the aftermath Selene&#x27;s inner circle succeed in capturing Warpath, injuring Angel and ruthlessly killing Onyxx and Diamond Lil before returning to Necrosha. Frost recognizes that the threat will not end until Selene and her inner circle are permanently stopped, and orders X-Force to travel to Necrosha and kill them all, including Wither.

===Second Coming===
During the events of the 2010 &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, Frost acts as moral support to Scott as well as the prime means of communication between Scott and his Alpha Roster of X-Men. When Rogue becomes aware that she has an empathic connection to Hope, she contacts Frost for help, Frost finds that the bond is not telepathic in nature. Along with all the other telepaths among the X-Men, Frost is affected by the psionic backlash when Bastion shuts Cerebra down and informs Scott that Ariel has died in a missile strike. Frost takes part in the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge and watches with concern as Hope manifests the Phoenix Force energy signature.

After the battle is over, the students have a bonfire to try to relax. As Frost stands around in her diamond state, she sees the Phoenix Force manifest around Hope, prompting her to remember that the Phoenix had told her to &quot;prepare&quot;. Horrified, she runs after Scott to tell him about what she saw and what she remembered. Finding him in Cerebra, Scott tells her five new mutants have manifested their powers across the globe.

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
In the 2012 storyline &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, Frost is one of the five X-Men taken over by the power of the Phoenix Force after it is fractured by Iron Man. Under its influence, she finds and kills a man who committed a hit and run against a mutant over a decade earlier. She also reveals to Cyclops that she had a psychic affair with Namor. During the final showdown against the Avengers and the X-Men, her portion of the Phoenix is violently taken by Cyclops. Frost is taken into custody by the Avengers and survives an assassination attempt by members of the Purifiers.

===All-New X-Men===
Frost is rescued from prison by Cyclops and Magneto, but it is revealed that her time as a Phoenix has rendered her telepathy erratic at best. Despite her resentment of Cyclops&#x27; recent actions she consents to depart with him to resume his mission to protect mutants. Frost trained in secret and regained full control over her telepathy. She continued as acting tutor for the Stepford Cuckoos and Jean Grey in the use of their powers.

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Following &quot;Secret Wars&quot; and the restoration of Earth-616 prior to the Incursions, Emma Frost is among a small team of X-Men who come into contact with the Terrigen mists at Muir Island, where they found Jamie Madrox dead on the facility grounds. Discovering that the Terrigen Mist cloud was toxic to mutants Scott and Emma formulate a plan to extinguish one of the Inhumans&#x27; Terrigen cloud. And while they are able to hold off the Inhumans just long enough to neutralize the green cloud, Cyclops is apparently killed by Black Bolt in self-defense. However at Scott&#x27;s funeral, Havok is seen afar speaking to Emma that something does not make sense, leading to Emma filling Alex Summers in on some unrevealed details. Black Bolt did not kill Cyclops, in fact, he never made it out of the facility at Muir Island, as he suffered an immediate reaction to the Terrigen mists. Since then Emma had been projecting an illusion of him to everyone else as a means of declaring war against the Inhumans in Scott&#x27;s name.

===Inhumans vs. X-Men===

Over the next eight months following Cyclops&#x27;s death, Emma starts to train and improve her time to turn into her diamond form. She also seems to be traumatized from the death of Scott and began to believe her own lie that Black Bolt was the one who actually killed him. Emma wasted no time and began to prepare for a war with the Inhumans by making alliances with various teams of X-Men, with the last being Storm&#x27;s X-Haven. She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing they have no time to attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth about why the X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so the mutants can survive.

After the time-displaced younger Cyclops reveals that Emma faked his future self&#x27;s death, Emma insists that she did what Cyclops would have chosen to do if he could, subsequently fleeing the battlefield with the aid of Havok after using reprogrammed sentinels to slaughter the Inhumans from Ennilux. She is later shown in a secret base donning a helmet that is a combination of Cyclops&#x27;s and Magneto&#x27;s in preparation for her next move, as she is now wanted and on the run from both the Inhumans and the X-Men for her actions since Cyclops&#x27;s death.

===Secret Empire===
During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Emma is revealed to be the true leader of the mutant nation in New Tian, which is somewhere in California, following Hydra&#x27;s takeover of the United States. She is using Xorn as her puppet ruler and controlling him with her telepathy. A flashback showed that Frost claimed a Cosmic Cube fragment from the unconscious Shang-Chi. When the time-displaced original X-Men rebel against New Tian&#x27;s government, Emma has Xorn send a group of mutants after them, succeeding in capturing most of the team except for Jean and Jimmy Hudson. She then talks to the younger Cyclops in his cell and telepathically torments him. It is revealed that Emma has been secretly working against Hydra. She, Beast, and Sebastian lead the raids on Supreme Hydra leader Steve Rogers&#x27;s throne, until Arnim Zola infuses the brainwashed leader with a power of the Cosmic Cube, and he bests them all easily.

===Becoming Black King===
Later Emma approached Iceman to request his help to save her brother Christian from their abusive father, however as they arrive at the Frost Mansion, they find that Christian is perfectly fine. In fact, he seems healthy and happy. Emma maintains her suspicions, which are ultimately confirmed when she finds the dead body of her father. It turns out that Christian is also a mutant, whose powers include, besides telepathy and telekinesis, the ability to perform astral projections. Thus, after killing his own father, Christian made an astral projection of him that ends up battling Iceman. Following this, Emma promises to spend the necessary time to heal Christian&#x27;s broken mind, taking on the role of head of the Frost International Company.

Following Magneto&#x27;s attack, Emma talks the X-Men into taking out the Inner Circle members of the Hellfire Club, while she goes after Sebastian, the man who made her the White Queen so many years ago. Though Shaw is still immune to her telepathy, Emma had an associate place a paralytic agent in his drink, allowing her to defeat him. Emma assumes the role of the Hellfire Club&#x27;s Black King, including a new darker outfit, and explaining in a letter to the X-Men that she intended to fix the broken world for mutants in her own way by taking control of the Hellfire Club.

===Nation of Krakoa===
After the founding of the mutant nation of Krakoa in House of X and Powers of X, Emma is again White Queen, now of the Hellfire Trading Company. The Hellfire Club has been re-imagined as the Hellfire Trading Company, which is responsible for legally exporting the miracle drugs produced on Krakoa. As White Queen, Emma has a seat on the Quiet Council, the ruling body of Krakoa. In addition, she created the Marauders, a team led by Kate Pryde and responsible for handling the black market for the miracle drugs, among other concerns.

==Powers and abilities==
Emma Frost possesses high-level telepathic abilities and is capable of transforming into an organic diamond state. Emma Frost has been a host to the Phoenix Force.

===Telepathy===
Emma Frost is classified as an &quot;Omega-Class telepath.&quot; She is capable of psionic feats, including the telepathic standards of: broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind-control, altering perceptions and memories, psychic shielding, astral projection, mind switching, brain engram modification, mental sedation, mental paralysis, induction of mental pain, projection of psionic force bolts or blast waves, and psionic lightning. She is also able to boost or activate a mutant&#x27;s powers through accessing their brain&#x27;s neurological pathways, and can communicate across global distances unaided. Her abilities have been stated to rival those of Charles Xavier himself. She has also been referred to as a &quot;psi of the highest order&quot;, been ranked among the five most skilled telepaths on the planet, demonstrated the ability to stalemate Exodus, and overcome telepaths classified as potentially capable of producing unlimited psionic energy (such as Nate Grey, Kid Omega, and Rachel Summers) through greater experience and skill.

===Diamond form===
Emma Frost manifests a secondary mutation, giving her the ability to transform her body into organic diamond, at the moment of the destruction of Genosha. She is translucent, retains mobility while being nearly invulnerable, and is able to support incredible amounts of weight. Her diamond body is virtually tireless since she does not produce fatigue toxins and has no need for water or food. She is also numbed from emotion, pain, and empathy, impervious to cold, and resistant to heat in this form. Furthermore, in this form, she does not need to breathe. Her diamond form also grants her superhuman strength. She has been shown to defeat Warpath, and has sent Lady Mastermind flying through a wall with a single punch.

Emma Frost is unable to access her psychic powers due to suppression by her diamond form&#x27;s adamantine luster. However, she is also granted total telepathic immunity while in diamond form. Her diamond form is also stated to emit low-level ultraviolet light, causing it to glow in darkness.

Nonetheless, her diamond form has a single molecular flaw, which, if exploited – such as being shot with a diamond bullet – can cause her body to shatter.

===Telekinetic potential===
On occasion, it has been hinted that Frost is also a latent telekinetic. Jean Grey&#x27;s displaced psyche was able to use Frost&#x27;s brain to generate a telekinetic force field and fly. During the Onslaught Saga, Frost unwittingly levitated several kitchen utensils while having a bad dream. When the mutant Synch &quot;synched&quot; with Frost&#x27;s powers, he was able to use them to levitate several objects and individuals in the room. This phenomenon is then referred to as telekinesis and credited to Frost&#x27;s psi powers.

===Innate traits and expertise===
Emma Frost has a gifted intellect with college degrees in multiple fields, including a Bachelor of Science in education with a minor in Business Administration from the prominent Marvel Universe&#x27;s Empire State University. A superb businesswoman, Emma Frost for many years was founder and CEO of Frost Enterprises, a major multinational conglomerate headquartered in New York City that rivaled Stark Enterprises and Worthington Industries and specialized in shipping, aerospace engineering and new technology R&amp;D.

She is also a highly capable planner, an electronics expert, and can invent machines that grant various psionic abilities, such as &quot;Multivac&quot;, a mutant locater capable of monitoring the psionic levels of mutants; the &quot;Hallucinator&quot; used to induce hypnotic hallucinations to brainwash others; the gun-like device that enabled her to exchange minds and powers with Storm; and the Mindtap mechanism which enhanced and enabled her Hellfire cohort Mastermind to project his illusions directly into the mind of the Phoenix.

Emma Frost is well versed in medical disciplines such as neurology, biochemistry, pathophysiology and genetics. This has allowed her to medically cure Polaris from an array of infectious diseases and examine Iceman&#x27;s brain physiology. Additionally, Frost has also been shown to bootstrap her own brain chemistry to counter a neurotoxin.

===Resources and anonymity===
Emma Frost possesses vast wealth as the owner of several multibillion-dollar conglomerates; Frost International, Frost Enterprises and Meridian Enterprises. Additionally, she has also made investments in oil companies, Stark Industries, Wakandan Airways, Ben Nishmura&#x27;s gamma research, Reed Richards&#x27; patent for unstable molecules and Cummings Aeronautics helicarrier project. Furthermore, as CEO of Frost International, Emma Frost has access to various technologies either designed by herself, or made through acquisitions of corporations such as LaNeige Industries which specialises in trans-dimensional travel and weaponry.

Her wealth and legal resources (Brooke &amp; Webster esq plc) affords her a degree of anonymity over the digital medium. This has been shown to extend to databases owned by the Avengers, and the Sentinel Bastion. Furthermore, several injunctions have been in place to prevent any discussion or referencing of Frost or her moniker the &quot;White Queen&quot; on any public networks.

As a member of the Phoenix Five, Emma Frost at one point telepathically scanned every single superhuman and human mind on the planet digging for the darkest of secrets and information.

===Attire and paraphernalia===
Emma Frost regards her revealing attire as battle armour which may give her a psychological edge against any opponent. Additionally, she considers high-heeled footwear as vital to her attire, and has demonstrated balance and proficiency with them in hand-to-hand combat. Emma Frost has to maintain a careful balance between her fashion sensibilities and being on the battlefield as this has on one occasion hindered her mobility on mountainous terrain.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

=== Critical response ===

Sara Century of &quot;Syfy&quot; stated, &quot;In the end, much of Emma’s sex appeal is based in her directness, her ability to compromise in impossible situations, and her deep understanding of establishing consent and boundaries with her partners. Her ability to put herself in the mind of her lovers and fulfill what they need shows deeply felt altruism. Though Scott seems to be the only man she has genuinely loved, with all her partners she laid the groundwork for mutually beneficial relationships. Emma Frost is a beautiful, intelligent woman who helped lead the X-Men with the ruthless mind of a true businesswoman, but it’s her hidden compassion that informs much of her sexuality. That surprising potential for open, messy, life-changing love is one of the reasons she continues to fascinate readers to this day.&quot;

Emily Stachelczyk of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; called Emma Frost the &quot;best anti-hero in the pantheon of Marvel Comics,&quot; writing, &quot;She has always looked after herself and carefully manipulated the environment around her to her advantage. This potential to switch sides is why she&#x27;s the superior Marvel anti-hero. Deadpool, while a good anti-hero, is not the best because his alignment is less suspect than Emma Frost&#x27;s. Her jumbled history of villainy and heroism not only keeps fans guessing, but also embodies that balance anti-hero characters strive for. Deadpool, while impressive, does not carry Emma Frost&#x27;s Machiavellian anti-hero status. It is never a guarantee that she will choose to be a hero in a moral dilemma, especially when considering that Deadpool does not always lack conventional heroic attributes when it comes down to the wire. Overall Emma Frost&#x27;s journey with the X-Men and lapses into villainy solidifies what it means to be a Marvel anti-hero.&quot;

Chase Magnett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called Emma Frost one of &quot;Marvel&#x27;s most interesting characters and someone with a devoted readership,&quot; saying, &quot;Even when you set aside Emma Frost&#x27;s extensive history and her impressive powerset, she&#x27;s still a Marvel character in desperate need of a solo series. That&#x27;s because she&#x27;s one of the most complex and interesting characters at the publisher today. Even in her earliest days as a villainous member of the Hellfire Club and leader of the Hellions, her motives were far more complicated than world domination. She is someone who has understood the multi-faceted nature of power and how it is essential in defining one&#x27;s place in the world. Every action she takes, even the misguided ones, stems from relatable fears and concerns and a heart that&#x27;s far greater than her early appearances revealed. Emma Frost has always been a character looking to make an impact and she has across the past 30 years of X-Men comics. No matter which sort of role she has played within that team&#x27;s many configurations, she has always been big enough to push them in new and surprising directions.&quot;

Andrew Wheeler of &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; wrote, &quot;Women&#x27;s issues and LGBT issues are intimately aligned, because both present opposition to the notion of straight cis male supremacy. Women represent a challenge to conformity, which is why female heroes and icons tend to be more important than male heroes in all corners of the LGBT community. The X-Men include many of the best female heroes in comics. Characters like Storm, Emma Frost, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, and Mystique, frequently shatter old-fashioned ideas about sex and gender through their strength, independence, leadership, and self-possession.&quot;

Chelsea Steiner of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; asserted, &quot;Emma Frost is such a compelling character because of her complexity and her unique qualities as a female character. She doesn’t care about her likeability, and possesses powers beyond her mutations. Frost is highly intelligent, witty, resourceful and very wealthy. She is Bruce Wayne with telepathic abilities. She’s James Bond with diamond skin. And unlike many female mutants, she is not ashamed or afraid of her own powers. She is a self-possessed and confident leader. After all, not many mutants would be just as comfortable leading the Hellfire Club as the do the X-Men. Frost is also in control of her sexuality, displaying sex positivity before the term even entered the lexicon. She’s romanced Cyclops, Tony Stark, and Namor, to name a few. This characteristic is a natural extension of Frost’s confidence and strong sense of self. She knows who she is and will not apologize for it. Her rich character history and skill set show that she could star in countless different films. She could headline an Atomic Blonde-style retro spy film. She could star in a violent revenge film based on the fallout from Genosha. Hell, I would even watch her in a superpowered reboot of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie starring her and the Stepford Cuckoos. There is so much to explore with Emma Frost, a character who deserves her own damn franchise.&quot;

Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Emma Frost a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character.

Claire Napier of &quot;WomenWriteAboutComics&quot; said, &quot;Emma Frost is remarkable because nobody—fan nor creator nor Marvel management—will ever say, “No, you are wrong for thinking that this character has been designed to imply eroticism.” She’s not a perfect construct, but she’s something of a relief. At least, at last, we can talk about it. That’s probably why Grant Morrison put her front and centre in his New X-Men. In superhero comics—which he loves to remind us are about muscular men and large-breasted ladies in spandex and latex punching each other through walls—Emma Frost is established as a mouthpiece for those who would sit at the back, whispering, “Isn’t this all a bit rude? Where are everybody’s sexy bits?” Here they are! They’re on Emma. She is our erotic scapegoat.&quot;

John Witiw of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called Emma Frost an &quot;iconic&quot; character.

Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; included Emma Frost in their &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Femme Fatales&quot; list, while Hilary Goldstein and Richard George ranked her 21st in their &quot;Top 25 X-Men&quot; list. &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; ranked Emma Frost 5th in their &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list. Anthony Orlando of &quot;Digital Trends&quot; ranked Emma Frost 5th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful X-Men Villains&quot; list. Matthew Perpetua of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; ranked Emma Frost 9th in their &quot;95 X-Men Members Ranked From Worst To Best&quot; list. Jessica Daniels of &quot;Looper&quot; ranked Emma Frost 10th in their &quot;15 Of The Most Popular Female Marvel Superheroes Ranked By Strength&quot; list. George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; ranked Emma Frost 11th in their &quot;Best X-Men Members Of All Time&quot; list, saying, &quot;As many of the best X-Men do, Emma Frost started out as a villain.&quot; Jo-Anne Rowney of &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ranked Emma Frost 12th in their &quot;Best Female Superheroes Of All Time&quot; list, writing, &quot;Step aside for this iconic lady, not only a complicated ice queen and staple of the X-Men comics, but she&#x27;s also just a straight up badass. Her fashion is always over the top, and makes a statement, but it&#x27;s all part of her image. She may have only been in less than half of the X-Men movies (shame on you guys), but she&#x27;s flying the flag for female superheroes everywhere.&quot; Sarah Prado of &quot;Game Rant&quot; ranked Emma Frost 12th in their &quot;Marvel: 14 Best Villains Turned Heroes&quot; list. Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Emma Frost 16th in their &quot;Let&#x27;s Rank Every X-Man Ever&quot; list, calling her a &quot;cruel beauty who became an occasionally-heroic cruel beauty.&quot;

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Emma Frost in their &quot;X-Men: 10 Best Female Villains&quot; list, in their &quot;10 Most Powerful X-Men&quot; list, and ranked her 1st in their &quot;10 Best Marvel Comics Characters That Went From Villain To Friend&quot; list, 5th in their &quot;Top 10 Telepathic Mutants&quot; list, 8th in their &quot;10 Best X-Men Characters Created By Chris Claremont&quot; list.

According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;X-Men Black: Emma Frost&quot; #1 was the 23rd best selling comic book in October 2018. &quot;X-Men Black: Emma Frost&quot; #1 was the 226th best selling comic book in 2018.

Matt Lune of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; found that &quot;X-Men Black: Emma Frost&quot; #1 &quot;brings Emma Frost back into the spotlight, and raises her power level higher than ever,&quot; asserting, &quot;From Genosha to Scott Summers, Emma Frost has lost a lot, but the biggest thing she has lost is perhaps herself. Here, in this issue, she finds herself again, and in doing so, fans have rediscovered a newly refreshed and re-energized version of a beloved X-Men mainstay. It’s hard not to spoil anything about the end of this issue, but Emma’s decision regarding her new title is so perfectly relevant for 2018 in a way that doesn’t scream at you but is still so provocative, so exciting and so very Emma Frost.&quot; Jamie Lovett of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;X-Men Black: Emma Frost&quot; #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, writing, &quot;Of all of the issues of X-Men Black, this Emma Frost issue does the most to progress its title character in a new and interesting direction. That&#x27;s no small feat considering the moral morass that Emma was dropped into thanks to an unearned villain turn way back during IvX. Other writers have been quick to try to redeem her, but arguably too quick considering how drastic and vile her actions were. Luckily, Leah Williams seem to have a total and complete understanding of Emma&#x27;s personality and values and knows exactly which way her moral compass should be pointing. Rather than try to redeem Emma or reduce her to a simple villain, Williams has Emma walk her own path, making use of her gifts in intelligent and subtle ways to position herself a major player in the mutant world. She&#x27;s joined by Chris Bachalo, one of the all-time great X-Men artists, for this story. While Bachalo&#x27;s signature sense of design and unorthodox framing techniques are intact, he has a small army of inkers and colorists assisting him. As a result, this isn&#x27;t Bachalo&#x27;s sharpest-looking work, and there are some inconsistencies within, but it is still some stellar-looking comics. It can not be emphasized enough how essential this issue is for anyone with a soft spot for Emma, and its plenty enjoyable for everyone else as well.&quot;

==== &quot;Giant-Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost&quot; - 2020 ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Giant Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost&quot; #1 was the 5th best selling comic book in February 2020. &quot;Giant Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost&quot; #1 was the 26th best selling comic book in 2020.

Mike Fugere of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called &quot;Giant Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost&quot; #1 &quot;another arcane, beautiful chapter to the Dawn of X era,&quot; writing, &quot;&quot;Giant-Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost&quot; #1 is an obvious tribute to an issue of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely&#x27;s iconic run on &quot;New X-Men,&quot; but its tone is far less psychedelic and far more ethereal. There is a sense of peace throughout Storm&#x27;s mind, despite the horrific revelation that&#x27;s discovered by the end of the issue. How the various emotional avatars within our Omega-Level mutant&#x27;s mind interact with Jean and Emma are probably the most compelling part of this issue from a storytelling standpoint. It does a wonderful job at expressing emotions that are not always openly expressed between characters with conflicting ideologies with humor and a wonderful sense of whimsy.&quot; Matthew Aguilar of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; stated, &quot;This story is a joy from beginning to end, but it also subtly hints at larger ramifications for not only Storm but every other mutant on the planet. Macro-level ideas regarding the soul, mutant resurrection, and the state of the mind are all explored in one way or another—anchored by the imminent danger to one of the X-Men&#x27;s most iconic faces, and it makes for one very compelling mix. Whether you&#x27;re looking for an entertaining adventure between two of your X-Men favorites, a thoughtful and action-packed journey through the mind, or another step forward in the evolution the X-Men, you&#x27;ll find all of it in &quot;Giant Size X-Men: Jean Grey and Emma Frost&quot; #1. It is one of the most stunning one-shots on the market today. In short, don&#x27;t miss out on this issue; you&#x27;ll regret it.&quot;

<text>Francesco Guicciardini (; 6 March 1483 – 22 May 1540) was an Italian historian and statesman. A friend and critic of Niccolò Machiavelli, he is considered one of the major political writers of the Italian Renaissance. In his masterpiece, &quot;The History of Italy&quot;, Guicciardini paved the way for a new style in historiography with his use of government sources to support arguments and the realistic analysis of the people and events of his time.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Francesco Guicciardini was born on 6 March 1483 in the Italian city of Florence, which was part of the Florentine Republic. He was the third of 11 children of Piero di Iacopo Guicciardini and Simona di Bongianni Gianfigliazzi. The Guicciardini were well-established members of the Florentine oligarchy as well as supporters of the Medici family. Influential in Florentine politics, Guicciardini&#x27;s ancestors had held the highest posts of honour in the state for many generations, as may be seen in his own genealogical &quot;Ricordi autobiografici e di famiglia&quot;.

Piero Guicciardini had studied with the philosopher Marsilio Ficino, who stood as his son&#x27;s godfather. Like his father, Francesco received a fine humanist education and studied the classics, learning both Latin and a little Greek. The boy was sent by his father to study law at the Universities of Ferrara and Padua, where he stayed until the year 1505.

The death of an uncle, who had occupied the Diocese of Cortona, induced the young Guicciardini to seek an ecclesiastical career. His father, however, &quot;thought the affairs of the Church were decadent. He preferred to lose great present profits and the chance of making one of his sons a great man rather than have it on his conscience that he had made one of his sons a priest out of greed for wealth or great position.&quot; Thus, the ambitious Guicciardini once again turned his attention to law. At 23, he was appointed by the Signoria of Florence to teach legal studies at the Florentine Studio.

In 1508, Guicciardini married Maria Salviati, the daughter of Alamanno Salviati, cementing an oligarchical alliance with the powerful Florentine family. In the same year, he wrote the &quot;Memorie di famiglia&quot;, a family memoir of the Guicciardini family, the &quot;Storie Fiorentine&quot; (&quot;Tales of Florence&quot;), and began his &quot;Ricordi&quot;, a collection of personal maxims and reflections.

===Spanish court===
Having distinguished himself in the practice of law, Guicciardini was entrusted by the Florentine Signoria with an embassy to the court of the King of Aragon, Ferdinand the Catholic, in 1512. He had doubts about accepting the position because it came with so little profit and would disrupt his law practice and take him away from the city. However, Francesco&#x27;s father convinced him of the court’s prestige and the honour of having been chosen at such a young age. &quot;No one could remember at Florence that such a young man had ever been chosen for such an embassy&quot;, he wrote in his diary. Thus Guicciardini started his career as a diplomat and statesman.

His Spanish correspondence with the Signoria reveals his power of observation and analysis, a chief quality of his mind. At the Spanish court, he learned lessons of political realism. In his letters back home, he expressed appreciation for being able to observe Spanish military methods and estimate their strength during the time of war. However, he also distrusted the calculated gestures of Ferdinand and referred to him as a model of the art of political deceit. During his time in Spain, the Medici regained power in Florence. Under the new regime, his embassy in Spain dragged on, frustrating Guicciardini as he yearned to return to Florence and participate in its political life. Guicciardini insisted on being recalled and even sent a letter to the youthful Lorenzo de’ Medici in an attempt to secure a position in the new ruling group. Guicciardini eventually returned home to Florence, where he took up his law practice again; in 1514, he served as a member of the Otto di Balìa, who controlled internal security, and in 1515, he served on the Signoria, the highest Florentine magistracy.

===Papacy===
In 1513, Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, became Pope Leo X and brought Florence under papal control, which provided opportunities for Florentines to enter papal service, as did Francesco in 1515. Leo X made him governor of Reggio in 1516 and Modena in 1517. This was the beginning of a long career for Guicciardini in papal administration, first under Leo X and then under his successor, Clement VII. &quot;He governed Modena and Reggio with conspicuous success&quot; according to &quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. He was appointed to govern Parma, and according to the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;in the confusion that followed the pope&#x27;s death, he distinguished himself by his defence of Parma against the French (1521).&quot;

In 1523, Guicciardini was appointed viceregent of the Romagna by Clement VII (1478–1534). These high offices rendered Guicciardini the virtual master of the Papal States beyond the Apennine Mountains. As he later described himself during this period: &quot;If you had seen messer Francesco in the Romagna...with his house full of tapestries, silver, servants thronged from the entire province where—since everything was completely referred to him—no one, from the Pope down, recognized anyone as his superior...&quot;.

The political turmoil in Italy was continuously intensifying. As hostilities between King Francis I of France and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, escalated, the Pope remained undecided over which side to back and so sought Guicciardini&#x27;s advice. Guicciardini advised an alliance with France and urged Clement to conclude the League of Cognac in 1526, which led to war with Charles V. Later that year, as the forces of Charles V threatened to attack, Clement made Guicciardini lieutenant-general of the papal army. Guicciardini was powerless to influence the commander of papal forces, Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, to take action. In April 1527, Guicciardini succeeded in averting an attack on Florence from a rebellious imperial army, which turned toward Rome instead. Less than two weeks later came the news of the Sack of Rome and the imprisonment of Clement in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo.

Guicciardini served three popes over a period of twenty years, and perhaps because of his experiences, he was highly critical of the papacy: &quot;I don&#x27;t know anyone who dislikes the ambition, the avarice, and the sensuality of priests more than I do... Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren&#x27;t for this consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as much as I love myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds.&quot;

===Florentine Republic===
Like many Florentine aristocrats of his day, Guicciardini believed in a mixed republican government based on the model of the Venetian constitution; despite working so often and closely with the Medici, he viewed their rule as tyrannical. Guicciardini was still able to reconcile his republican ideals and his support of the Medici: &quot;The equality of men under a popular government is by no means contradicted if one citizen enjoys greater reputation than another, provided it proceed from the love and reverence of all, and can be withheld by the people at their pleasure. Indeed, without such supports, republics can hardly last.&quot;

Shortly after the Sack of Rome, Guicciardini returned to Florence, but by 1527, the Medici had been expelled from the city, and a republic had been re-established by the extreme anti-Medici &quot;Arrabiati&quot; faction. Because of his close ties to the Medici, Guicciardini was held suspect in his native city. In March 1530, as a result of his service to the Medici, Guicciardini was declared a rebel and had his property confiscated.

This final Florentine Republic did not last long, however, and after enduring the Siege of Florence by imperial troops for nine months, in 1530 the city capitulated. Under the command of Clement VII, Guicciardini was assigned the task of punishing the Florentine citizens for their resistance to the Medici, and he dealt out justice mercilessly to those who had opposed the will of the Pope. Benedetto Varchi claimed that in carrying out his task, &quot;Messer Francesco Guicciardini was more cruel and more ferocious than the others&quot;.

===Final years===

In 1531, Guicciardini was assigned the governorship of Bologna, the most important city in the northern Papal States by Clement VII. Guicciardini resigned after Clement&#x27;s death in 1534 and returned to Florence, where he was enlisted as advisor to Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, &quot;whose position as duke had become less secure following the death of the pope&quot;. Guiccardini defended him in Naples in 1535 before Charles V, contesting the exiled rebels&#x27; accusations of tyranny. He assisted in successfully negotiating the marriage of Alessandro to the emperor Charles V’s daughter Margaret of Parma in 1536, and for a short time Gucciardini was the most trusted advisor to Alessandro until the Duke&#x27;s assassination in 1537.

Then, Guicciardini allied himself with Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, who was just 17 and new to the Florentine political system. Guicciardini supported Cosimo as duke of Florence; nevertheless, Cosimo dismissed him shortly after rising to power. Guicciardini retired to his villa in Arcetri, where he spent his last years working on the &quot;Storia d&#x27;Italia&quot;. He died in 1540 without male heirs.

His nephew, Lodovico Guicciardini, was also a historian known for his 16th-century works on the Low Countries.

==Works==
None of Francesco Guicciardini&#x27;s works was published during his lifetime. It was not until 1561 that the first sixteen of the twenty books of his &quot;History of Italy&quot; were published. The first English &quot;translation&quot; by Sir Geffray Fenton was published in 1579. Until 1857, only the &quot;History&quot; and a small number of extracts from his aphorisms were known. In that year, his descendants opened the Guicciardini family archives and committed to Giuseppe Canestrini the publication of his memoirs in ten volumes.
These are some of his works recovered from the archives:
*&quot;Ricordi politici e civili&quot;, already noted, consisting of about 220 maxims on political, social, and religious topics;
*&quot;Observations on Machiavelli&#x27;s Discorsi&quot;, which bring into relief the views of Italy&#x27;s two great theorists on statecraft in the 16th century, and show that Guicciardini regarded Machiavelli somewhat as an amiable visionary or political enthusiast;
*&quot;Storia Fiorentina&quot;, an early work of the author, distinguished by its animation of style, brilliancy of portraiture and liberality of judgment;
*&quot;Dialogo del reggimento di Firenze&quot;, also in all probability an early work, in which the various forms of government suited to an Italian commonwealth are discussed with subtlety, contrasted and illustrated from the vicissitudes of Florence up to the year 1494.
*There is also a series of short essays, entitled &quot;Discorsi politici&quot;, composed during Guicciardini&#x27;s Spanish legation.
Taken in combination with Machiavelli&#x27;s treatises, the &quot;Opere inedite&quot; offer a comprehensive body of Italian political philosophy before Paolo Sarpi.

===&quot;The History of Italy&quot;===
Guicciardini is best known as the author of the &quot;Storia d&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;History of Italy&quot;), which provides a detailed account of politics in the Italian Peninsula between 1490 and 1534. Written during the last years of his life, this work contains the historian&#x27;s observations collected over his entire lifetime and was a work intended for posterity. As Gilbert writes: &quot;The &quot;History of Italy&quot; stands apart from all his writings because it was the one work which he wrote not for himself, but for the public.&quot;

In his research, Guicciardini drew upon material that he gathered from government records as well as from his own extensive experience in politics. His many personal encounters with powerful Italian rulers serves to explain his perspective as a historian: &quot;Francesco Guicciardini might be called a psychological historian—for him the motive power of the huge clockwork of events may be traced down the mainspring of individual behavior. Not any individual, be it noted, but those in positions of command: emperors, princes and popes who may be counted on to act always in terms of their self-interest—the famous Guicciardinian particolare.&quot;

In the following excerpt, the historian records his observations on the character of Pope Clement VII: &quot;And although he had a most capable intelligence and marvelous knowledge of world affairs, yet he lacked the corresponding resolution and execution. For he was impeded not only by his timidity of spirit, which was by no means small, and by a strong reluctance to spend, but also by a certain innate irresolution and perplexity, so that he remained almost always in suspension and ambiguous when he was faced with those deciding those thing which from afar he had many times foreseen, considered, and almost revealed.&quot;

Moreover, what sets Guicciardini apart from other historians of his time is his understanding of historical context. His approach was already evident in his early work &quot;The History of Florence&quot; (1509): &quot;The young historian was already doubtlessly aware of the meaning of historical perspective; the same facts acquiring different weight in different contexts, a sense of proportion was called for.&quot; In the words of one of Guicciardini&#x27;s severest critics, Francesco de Sanctis: &quot;If we consider intellectual power [the &quot;Storia d&#x27;Italia&quot;] is the most important work that has issued from an Italian mind.&quot;

===Guicciardini and Machiavelli on politics and history===
Guicciardini was friends with Niccolò Machiavelli; the two maintained a lively correspondence until the latter&#x27;s death in 1527. Guicciardini had a somewhat higher social standing than his friend, but through their letters, a relaxed, comfortable relationship between the two emerges. &quot;Aware of their difference in class, Machiavelli nevertheless was not intimidated by Guicciardini&#x27;s offices... or by his aristocratic connections. The two established their rapport because of mutual regard for each other&#x27;s intellect.&quot; They discussed personal matters and political ideas and influenced each other&#x27;s work.

Guicciardini was critical of some of the ideas expressed by Machiavelli in his &quot;Discourses on Livy&quot;: &quot;Guicciardini&#x27;s principal objection to the theories which Machiavelli advanced in the &quot;Discourses&quot; was that Machiavelli put things &#x27;too absolutely.&#x27; Guicciardini did not agree with Machiavelli&#x27;s basic assumption that Rome could serve as a perfect norm.&quot; Both were innovative in their approach to history:&quot;Machiavelli and Guicciardini are important transitional figures in the development of historical writing. The historical consciousness that becomes visible in their work is a significant rupture in our thinking about the past... Human agency was a central element in the historical thought of Machiavelli and Guicciardini, but they did not have a modern notion of individuality... They started to disentangle historiography from its rhetorical framework, and in Guicciardini&#x27;s work we can observe the first traces of a critical historical method.&quot;

<text>The Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (, INSA; &quot;National Institute for Applied Sciences&quot;) is a French engineering university.

There are seven INSA establishments organised as a network and located in major French regional cities Lyon, Rennes, Rouen, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Valenciennes, Blois and Bourges. All INSAs share the same philosophy, at the same time preserving an individual identity based on their respective histories, origins, economic environments and on poles of excellence developed from specific competences.

The INSA network represents the largest engineer training group in France: 12% of all engineers who obtain their degree in France each year graduate from one of the INSA establishments. To date, almost 50,000 INSA engineers contribute to the social and economic fabric worldwide. The INSA are public establishments with a scientific, cultural and professional orientation. They are under the aegis of the Ministry of Higher Education and are accredited by the &quot;Commission des Titres&quot; to deliver engineering degrees.

== Academics ==

About 20% of French engineering students enroll in a school directly after a high school diploma (&quot;Baccalauréat&quot;) without first attending a post-high school preparatory school (&quot;Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles&quot; or &quot;prépa&quot;), and then attend for five years of study leading to a master&#x27;s degree. The Groupe INSA &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; engineering schools are selective, and unlike French universities they do not offer open enrollment, but they do allow for direct enrollment either after high school or after graduating from a post- high school &quot;prépa&quot;. International students with a high school or bachelor&#x27;s degree may also apply directly to INSA, and 27% of students are from outside of France. In 2022, annual tuition for a master&#x27;s degree was: €601 for French; €1,900 for other Europeans; €5,000 for all others.

Although INSA engineering schools are selective and can be more expensive than public universities in France, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; typically have much smaller class sizes and student bodies, and many of their programs are taught in English. International internships, study abroad opportunities, and close ties with government and the corporate world are a hallmark of the &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;. Many of the top ranked schools in Europe are members of the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; &quot;(CGE)&quot;, as are INSA engineering schools. Degrees from INSA are accredited by the &quot;Conférence des Grandes Écoles&quot; and awarded by the ministry of higher education ().

== Prestige ==
All Groupe INSA engineering schools are under the supervision of the Ministry of higher education () and are &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot;, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and connected to the main framework of the French public university system. Similar to the Ivy League in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process. Alums go on to occupy elite positions within government, administration, and corporate firms in France.

Of the engineering schools that offer direct entry after receiving a baccalaureate, INSA are considered among the most selective and the number of applications has steadily increased over the years.

<doc id="697941" wikidata="Q104840562" url="?curid=697941" title="Barnburners and Hunkers">
<text>The Barnburners and Hunkers were the names of two opposing factions of the New York Democratic Party in the mid-19th century. The main issue dividing the two factions was that of slavery, with the Barnburners being the anti-slavery faction. While this division occurred within the context of New York politics, it reflected the national divisions in the Democratic Party and the United States broadly in the years preceding the American Civil War.

==Barnburners==

The Barnburners were the radical faction. The term &quot;barnburner&quot; was derived from a folktale about a Dutch farmer who burned down his own barn in order to get rid of a rat infestation. In this case it was applied to men who were thought to be willing to destroy all banks and corporations, in order to root out their abuses.

The Barnburners opposed expanding the public debt, and were opposed to the power of large state-established corporations. They also generally came to oppose the extension of slavery. They also stood for local control by the Albany Regency, as against the Polk political machine which the new administration was trying to build up in New York. 

At the 1848 presidential election, the Barnburners left the Democratic Party, refusing to support presidential nominee Lewis Cass. They joined with other anti-slavery groups, predominantly the abolitionist Liberty Party and some anti-slavery Conscience Whigs from New England and the Midwest, to form the Free Soil Party. This group nominated former President Van Buren to run again for the presidency. Their vote divided Democratic strength. Zachary Taylor, the Whig nominee, was elected to office.

After the Compromise of 1850 temporarily neutralized the issue of slavery and undercut the party&#x27;s no-compromise position, most Barnburners who had joined the Free Soil Party returned to the Democratic Party. In 1854, some Barnburners helped to form the Republican Party.

===Notable Barnburners===

* John Adams Dix, U.S. Senator (184549)
* Martin Van Buren, 8th President of the United States (183741)
* Silas Wright, Governor of New York (184647) and U.S. Senator (183344)

The Hunkers were the relatively pro-government faction. They opposed the Barnburners, and favored state banks, internal improvements, and minimizing the slavery issue. 

===Notable Hunkers===

* Samuel Beardsley, U.S. Representative from Utica and New York Supreme Court justice
* Edwin Croswell, publisher of the &quot;Albany Argus&quot;
* Daniel S. Dickinson, U.S. Senator (184451)
* William L. Marcy, U.S. Secretary of State (185357), U.S. Secretary of War (184549), Governor of New York (183338) and U.S. Senator (183133)
* Horatio Seymour, Governor of New York (1853–54 and 1863–64) and Democratic nominee for President in 1868

===Hards and Softs===
Following the 1848 election, the Hunkers themselves split over the question of reconciliation with the Barnburners, with the Softs, led by Marcy, favoring reconciliation, and the Hards, led by Dickinson, opposing it. This split would be exacerbated following the 1852 presidential election, when disputes over patronage led to an even broader split between Hards and Softs and helped lead to the defeat of the Soft governor, Horatio Seymour, running for re-election in 1854.

<doc id="697946" wikidata="Q2352613" url="?curid=697946" title="M-21 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-21 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan connecting the cities of Grand Rapids and Flint. The highway passes through rural farming country and several small towns along its course through the Lower Peninsula. Following the course of a handful of rivers, M-21 also connects some of the state&#x27;s freeways like Interstate 96 (I-96), US Highway 127 (US 127) and I-75. The highway is used by between 1,700 and 36,000 vehicles daily.

M-21 was designated along the highway by July 1, 1919 between Ionia and Goodells near Port Huron. Changes made in the 1920s extended it on the west end to Holland and on the east end to Port Huron. M-21 was truncated at both of its current termini as two Interstate freeways were completed. I-196 functionally replaced M-21 between Holland and Grand Rapids with a portion retained under state maintenance as Old M-21, now M-121. I-69 replaced M-21 from Flint to Port Huron. A section of M-21 through Flint became M-56. That designation was decommissioned in 1984 when M-21 was returned to its former routing in Flint.

==Route description==
M-21 starts on Fulton Street at a junction with M-37 (East Beltline Avenue) on the east side of greater Grand Rapids. Fulton passes through residential areas on this side of town, and crosses over I-96. Continuing east, the highway passes the headquarters of Amway and crosses the Grand River near its confluence with the Thornapple River in Ada. M-21 runs long the north back of the Grand, turning southeasterly and east to Lowell. The roadway passes through downtown and over the Flat River near its confluence with the Grand. M-21 runs east of town through the southern end of the Lowell State Gaming Area and crosses into Ionia County.

The road follows Bluewater Highway along the river, passing to the north of Saranac. It turns northeasterly through lightly forested farmland passing Bertha Brock Park as it approaches the city of Ionia. In town, M-66 runs concurrently along M-21 for a few blocks in the central business district. Bluewater Highway leaves town and continues along the Grand River to Muir, and the trunkline crosses the Maple River on east side of town. M-21 follows the course of the Maple briefly before turning east through farms along the Stony Creek to Pewamo. The highway bypasses the village to the south and crosses into Clinton County near the eastern edge of town. Western Clinton County&#x27;s landscape is dominated by farms, interrupted by the community of Fowler. The highway enters the county seat, St. Johns on State Street, passing through a residential section of town. In the middle of downtown, M-21 intersects 2nd Street, which carries Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127). East of downtown, M-21 passes back into agricultural land and under the US 127 freeway. The landscape is once again dominated by these farms through the western side of the county.

M-21 passes into the community of Ovid and over the county line into Shiawassee County. Continuing east through the county, the highway enters Owosso. The trunkline follows Main Street into downtown and crosses the Shiawassee River between junctions with M-52 and M-71 in Owosso. M-21 runs roughly parallel to the river out into the country side. The remainder of the county is the same, dominated by farmland along a straight stretch of flat highway. North of Lennon, M-21 meets M-13 at an intersection on the Shiawassee–Genesee county line. The landscape starts to transition to residential subdivisions as the roadway approaches the Flint area.

In Flint Township, M-21 follows Corunna Road and meets I-75/US 23 at exit 118. The road crosses a former branch line of the Canadian National Railway (converted into a bicycle trail) east of the interchange. Corunna Road angles to the northeast near Bradley Avenue and terminates at Court Street. The trunkline turns east and follows Court over a tributary of the Flint River near Aldrich Park. Northeast of the stream, M-21 splits along a one-way pairing of Court and 5th streets. Eastbound traffic follows 5th Street past the city and county buildings in the area. The highway passes over I-475 and terminates at the east frontage road. Traffic connecting between M-21 and I-475 must use the frontage roads to make the connection.

All of M-21, except for some segments just outside Grand Rapids and Flint, along with the highway split into two one-way streets inside Flint, is undivided surface road; none of M-21 is freeway. The section between I-75/US 23 and Saginaw Street in Flint is part of the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. M-21, like all state highways, is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). As part of these responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes along its highways. They use a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. Traffic volumes in 2009 vary from 22,756 vehicles in the Forest Hills neighborhood east of Grand Rapids to 1,719 vehicles in Pewamo daily. MDOT reported that the peak AADT was 36,053 vehicles daily near the I-75 interchange in the Flint area.

==History==
Before the Interstate era, M-21 extended across the entire Lower Peninsula, from the junction with US 31 in Holland near Lake Michigan east to the St. Clair River at Port Huron, and crossed into Canada where the Blue Water Bridge is currently located.

M-21 was designated by July 1, 1919 on a routing from Ionia to Goodells. Along the way, it ran through Lyons and Pewamo, joining its current routing to Ovid. M-21 continued through Corunna to Lennon and Flint. There it joined its last routing between Flint and the Port Huron area. The highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924, and the west end was extended to Grand Rapids in 1925 along M-16 (later US 16). The previous routing through Owosso and Lennon was redesignated as M-71 at this time when M-21 was shifted along the current routing between the two communities. The 1926 creation of the United States Highway System led to the extension of M-21 along US 16 to Grand Rapids. From there west, M-21 replaced M-51 on Chicago Drive to Holland. The highway was moved to a new routing between Flint and Lapeer in 1929; the old route was renumbered M-21A. All in-city portions of M-21 were transferred to state control in 1931 with the passage of the Dykstra Act of 1931 (PA 131 of 1931).

A Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) designation was created in the Grand Rapids area in 1945. This designation ran from the corner of 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp. US 16 and Byp. US 131 on 28th Street. At East Beltline Avenue, Byp. US 131/Byp. M-21 turned north back to M-21. M-21A in Flint was turned over to local control in 1948, decommissioning the number. The Byp. M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953. The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus. M-21 instead.

A bypass of Zeeland opened in 1958, rerouting M-21 around the town. The I-196 freeway opened through Grand Rapids in 1964, and M-21 was routed along the freeway between Chicago Drive in Grandville and downtown, using I-96 to complete the connection to its previous routing on Fulton Street.

The first freeway segment of M-21 on the east end was built from Wadhams to Port Huron in 1966. A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971. M-21 was routed down M-13 to the new freeway where it joined the M-78 designation from M-13 east. The section of M-21 formerly between M-13 and Bus. M-54 was redesignated M-56. The M-78 designation was replaced by I-69 in 1973 after I-69 was extended north from Charlotte. The 1974 completion of I-196 meant the truncation of M-21 to end in Grand Rapids. At the time, M-21 was extended along Fulton Street to the East Beltline, and the business loop was truncated into a spur route redesignated BS I-196. The remaining segment of freeway connecting Flint with Port Huron opened in 1984 as I-69, and M-21 was shortened to Flint. M-56 was replaced by M-21 at this time as well. The former M-21 in Port Huron became BL I-69, and the remainder was turned back to local control.

===M-21A===

M-21A was an alternate route for M-21 near Flint. It started at an intersection between M-21 (Court Street) and US 10 (Dort Highway) and ran southward concurrently with US 10 to Lapeer Road. The highway turned eastward along Lapeer Road and out of the city of Flint. It continued to an intersection with M-15 south of Davison, where it turned northward, running concurrently with M-15 into downtown. At an intersection with M-21 at Flint Street, M-21A ended. The highway was created in 1929, and it was turned over to local control in late 1948.

===Bypass M-21===

Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) was a bypass route of M-21 in Kent County. It started at the intersection between M-21 (Chicago Drive) and 28th Street in Grandville. From there, it was routed eastward along 28th Street running concurrently with Byp. US 16. At the intersection with US 131 (Division Avenue) on the Wyoming–Paris township line, a Byp. US 131 started and ran concurrently eastward along 28th Street. Byp. US 16/Byp. US 131/Byp. M-21 continued along 28th Street in Paris Township to an intersection with Kalamazoo Avenue where M-37 turned off Kalamazoo and onto 28th Street. Further east, 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue intersected. At that junction, Byp. US 131/Byp. M-21 turned northward along East Beltline while M-37 turned south and Byp. US 16 continued eastward on 28th Street. Running northward in Grand Rapids Township, Byp. US 131/Byp. M-21 intersected US 16/M-50 at Cascade Road before Byp. M-21 terminated at the intersection with M-21 (Fulton Street).

During World War II, the state was building a beltline system for Grand Rapids. This highway, numbered M-114 was decommissioned by 1945 and the streets that composed it were given new designations. Byp. M-21 was routed along 28th Street from Grandville to Paris Township and along East Beltline into Grand Rapids Township. In 1953, the mainline M-21 was rerouted to replace its bypass around downtown, decommissioning the Byp. M-21 designation.

Major intersections




===Business M-21===

Business M-21 (Bus. M-21) was a business route of M-21 in the Grand Rapids area. It started at an interchange between Chicago Drive and I-196/M-21 in Grandville and followed Chicago Drive easterly through downtown Grandville. From there, the highway ran along industrial areas on the north side of Wyoming, running parallel to the I-196 freeway. At the intersection with Clyde Park Avenue, Bus. M-21 turned northward along Grandville Avenue and entered the city of Grand Rapids. At Franklin Street, the business route turned eastward and terminated at US 131.

In 1953, M-21 was rerouted to replace its bypass route. The former route through downtown Grand Rapids was redesignated as Bus. M-21. At the time, Bus. M-21 continued eastward along Franklin Street before turning northward on Eastern Avenue into downtown Grand Rapids. Once there, it followed Fulton Street eastward through East Grand Rapids and into Grand Rapids Township where it terminated at East Beltline Avenue. The business loop was truncated to US 131 in 1972, and then redesignated as BS I-196 in 1974.

Major intersections



===M-56===

M-56 was a state trunkline highway from 1971 to the mid-1980s that replaced the M-21 designation from M-13 to Flint when the M-21 (now I-69) freeway was being built. The highway started at the intersection with M-13 on the Shiawassee–Genesee county line west of Flint. From there, it followed Corunna Road eastward through rural areas of Genesee County. Today, the area is farm fields through Clayton Township, and in Flint Township it is more suburban. The highway intersected the I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway just west of Flint&#x27;s city line. Once in Flint, M-56 turned northeasterly onto Court Street. At an intersection with Saginaw Street, the highway turned southeasterly and then ended at the I-69/M-21 freeway.

In 1971, M-21 was rerouted in the Flint area. After the change, it turned south along M-13 on the Shiawassee–Genesee county line to the M-78 freeway and then routed eastward to replace M-78. The former routing of M-21 on the western side of the county into downtown was redesignated M-56. When the M-21 designation was replaced with the I-69 designation in 1984, the M-56 designation was retired and M-21 was restored in its place.

<text>Domenico da Piacenza (c. 1400 – c. 1470), also known as Domenico da Ferrara, was an Italian Renaissance dancing master. He became a very popular teacher with his students – most notably Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro – who both later became successful dance masters. At a time between 1452 and 1463, he received the Order of the Golden Spur. 

==Biography==

Domenico was born in Piacenza, Northern Italy in around 1400, and was the first known dancing master to have left published dance instructions. He began teaching dance in around 1440 and is believed to have taught elements of dramatic mime and elaborate dance. He taught future dance masters Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro. 

He moved from Piacenza to Ferrara during Leonello d&#x27;Este&#x27;s tenure as marquis of the city between 1441 and 1450. Between 1452 and 1463 Domenico received the Order of the Golden Spur, and is believed to have been knighted by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. In April 1455 he composed a dance for the wedding between Tristano Sforza and Niccolò III d&#x27;Este&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Beatrice.

In late 1455 he choreographed dances for the wedding between Ippolita Maria Sforza and Alfonso II. In the 1450s or 1460s he published &quot;De arte saltandi et choreas ducendi&quot; about dancing and choreography, the oldest surviving European guide on dancing. It gives instructions on various dances and also outlines what is required to be a good dancer. He identified that successful dance consisted of many techniques: an understanding of musical tempos, knowledge of the prescribed steps, manners, agility, the ability to moderate one&#x27;s movements, overall control of the body, and speed. Domenico died in around 1470 in Ferrara, Northern Italy.
