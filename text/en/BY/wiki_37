<text>Bournemouth University is a public university in Bournemouth, England, with its main campus situated in neighbouring Poole. The university was founded in 1992; however, the origins of its predecessor date back to the early 1900s.

The university currently has over 16,000 students, including over 3,000 international students.
The university is recognised for its work in the media industries. Graduates from the university have worked on a number of Hollywood films, including &quot;Gravity&quot;, which was awarded the Achievement in Visual Effects Oscar at the 86th Academy Awards in 2015.

In 2023, Bournemouth University received a silver rating in the Teaching Excellence Framework, a government assessment of the quality of undergraduate teaching in universities and other higher education providers in England.

== History ==

=== Predecessor institutions ===
The university was first founded in the early 20th century as the predecessor Bournemouth Municipal College. The college initially offered courses to prepare students for University of London degrees (1942-1976). In the mid-1960s there were 6,850-day and evening students. As early as 1965, in the House of Commons, the number of students at the college was highlighted, and the Secretary of State was asked to consider a university application. At the time the Government did not intend to create any new universities until the late 1970s.

In the 1970s the college became the Bournemouth College of Technology. Later that decade, following a review by the Dorset Education Committee, the College of Technology changed to become Dorset Institute of Higher Education (DIHE).

Bernard MacManus was appointed Director in 1983 and presided over a significant expansion in curriculum and student numbers, against a backdrop of initial uncertainty over the Weymouth Campus. During this time the Talbot Campus was consolidated having been established in 1976. The neighbouring Student Village was also constructed. A second campus was established at Lansdowne. The period between 1983 and 1994 saw the Institute expand into new disciplines including heritage, tourism, tax, public relations, computer animation and information systems.
Two foundation stones remain within university buildings. The foundation stone for the College of Technology (1970s) resides in the main lobby of Poole House, Talbot Campus. The foundation stone for the Dorset Institute is mounted in Dorset House near what is now called &quot;The Edge&quot;. Bernard MacManus was honoured by Bournemouth University with an honorary doctorate in 2007.

=== University status ===
The expansion under Dr MacManus allowed the institute to make a strong case to become a polytechnic, which was gained in 1990. In 1992 all polytechnics were awarded university status and the institute was renamed to become Bournemouth University.

By September 1994, over 9,000 students had been recruited nationally, and internationally, to undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. By 1996 the university had 11 endowed professorial posts, including:

* Royal Mail Chair in Business Performance Improvement
* Intel Chair in Computer Supported Cooperation
* British Property Federation Chair in Archaeology and Development
* IBM Chair in Concurrent Engineering
* Intergraph Chair in Electronic Design Automation
* GPT Chair in Software Engineering
* Steele Raymond Chair in Business Law
* Hewlett-Packard Chair in Computer Animation
* Sutcliffe Chair in Catering Management
* Marks &amp; Spencer Chair in Retail Management

In recent years the university has announced a significant investment programme, and by 2018 it plans to invest £200 million in new buildings and facilities including a new Student Centre, which opened in March 2015.

=== List of chancellors ===
* 1992 – Caroline Cox, Baroness Cox, First Chancellor of university
* 2001 – John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Warwick
* 2006 – Dione Digby, Lady Digby
* 2009 – Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, former President of the Supreme Court and Senior Law Lord
* 2019 – Kate Adie CBE, DL

=== List of directors and vice chancellors ===
* 1983 – Bernard MacManus, as Director of the Dorset Institute
* 1990 – Bernard MacManus, as first Vice Chancellor
* 1994 – Gillian Slater
* 2005 – Sir Paul Curran, subsequently Vice Chancellor of City University London
* 2010 – John Vinney
* 2024 - Alison Honour

===Coat of arms===
The university coat of arms was granted in 1992 by the official heraldic authority for England, the College of Arms. The talbots, the heraldic beasts on the shield, represent the location of the main campus. The crowns denote the three Saxon crowns of the Kingdom of Wessex, and the nearby boroughs. The blue represents the nearby sea, reflecting the location of the university, on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset. The red dragon in the coat of arms represents Dorset, and the scroll represents learning.

The Latin motto &quot;Discere Mutari Est&quot; means &quot;To Learn is to Change&quot;.

== Campuses ==

Bournemouth University has two campuses: Talbot Campus and Lansdowne Campus.

=== Talbot Campus ===

The Talbot Campus is situated at Fern Barrow on the Poole side of the boundary with Bournemouth. It is where the main University buildings are located, including the students&#x27; union and the main library.

=== Lansdowne Campus ===

The Lansdowne Campus is just outside Bournemouth&#x27;s town centre, housing three teaching and administrative buildings, the students&#x27; union nightclub and various halls of residence located around Christchurch Road, Oxford Road and Holdenhurst Road. A new Bournemouth University International College is currently being built at the campus. Unlike Talbot, Lansdowne is not a self-contained campus.

== Organisation and governance ==
Bournemouth University is currently divided into the following faculties:
*The Faculty of Science and Technology (Archaeology, Anthropology, Biology, Geography, Design, Engineering, Computing and Informatics, Forensic Sciences, and Psychology) - home to the Festival of Design &amp; Innovation
*The Faculty of Media and Communication – home to the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy &amp; Management (CIPPM), the Centre for Excellence in Media Practice, the National Centre for Computer Animation and the Centre for Broadcasting History Research
*The Faculty of Health and Social Sciences
*The Bournemouth University Business School – home to the International Centre for Tourism &amp; Hospitality Research

==Academics==
=== Awards ===
In 2011 the university was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education, for &quot;world-class computer animation teaching with wide scientific and creative applications&quot;. In 2014 the courses at the university were praised by the Prime Minister in Parliament.

===Rankings and reputation===
Bournemouth University appeared for the first time in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings in 2015/16: ranked joint 401–500 in the world and 57th among UK universities. The university experienced a brief upward trend in national rankings: in 2016, it rose from 65th to 54th in The Complete University Guide, from 71st to 63rd place in The Guardian University League Table and from 88th to joint 82nd in the Sunday Times Good University Guide. The high salary increases awarded to Bournemouth University Vice Chancellor John Vinney were justified as a reflection of this improvement.

==Student life==

The Students&#x27; Union at Bournemouth University (SUBU) is based on the Talbot Campus at the Student Centre, which was opened in 2015. Its facilities are open to students at Lansdowne Campus and the partner colleges.

SUBU has over 120 clubs and societies for students to take part in alongside their studies at Bournemouth University. SUBU itself is composed of various departments, such as SUBU Advice, Democracy and Equality, Representation, Volunteering, Insight and Policy and Activities.

SUBU operates numerous venues including the nightclub The Old Fire station on the Lansdowne campus, the Student Shop, Ground Up Cafe and with Dylans Bar on Talbot.

<doc id="703402" wikidata="Q1499001" url="?curid=703402" title="The Scary Sleepover">
<text>The Scary Sleepover is a children&#x27;s picture book, written for children between three and six years of age. The story is written by Ulrich Karger and illustrated by Uli Waas.

== Plot summary ==
The book tells about a group of children having a Halloween sleepover party at school (Kindergarten). The children prepare for it by making decorations and costumes. As night draws near, so do the children&#x27;s fears. One student, Mary, shares a trick her father taught her with the other students. He gave her a special bright star - whenever she feels afraid to go to bed, she has only to think about her star. This sends the darkness and the evil ghosts from her heart. Jonas does not believe in that, but he also thinks he is not afraid of ghosts. In the end, all the children need another, older trick: keeping the hallway light on all night.

== Themes ==
&quot;The Scary Sleepover&quot; focuses on children who learn to overcome their fears of the dark by the example of a Halloween sleepover at school. Incidentally is detected: &quot;The most boastful of the children becomes the most afraid. The Halloween setting with masks and long shadows in the dark is the perfect backdrop for this discussion&quot;.

== Reception ==
Vicki Arkoff positively evaluates the text and the illustrations, but sees a problem especially for American readers: &quot;Right off the bat it&#x27;s clear that this simple picture book is a translated work because of its &#x27;this would never happen in this country&#x27; premise. After all, how many parents do you know who let their pre-schoolers and kindergarteners have sleepovers at school? Sure enough it&#x27;s a German tale about what happens during a Halloween sleepover party as nighttime falls and common fears begin to arise. (..) Putting the slightly awkward premise aside, this is a gently reassuring bedtime story sure to soothe bedtime jitters in homes everywhere&quot;. Stan Steiner sees in the book &quot;a cute solution to help overcome those ghastly fears around Halloween&quot;.

<text>Ulrich Karger (3 February 1957 in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany) is an author and teacher of religion at a school for speech disabled children in Berlin.

His publications are aimed at children and adults. The complete retelling of Homers Odyssey in prose form in a book for young people, which received acclaim from critics in the complete German linguistic area, is one of his most successful works. This work also forms the basis of the &quot;piece of read-music&quot; &quot;Odyssey 1-5-9&quot; that Ulrich Karger developed together with the Berlin jazz-composer Gernot Reetz. Beside other several languages is his picture book for children &quot;Geisterstunde im Kindergarten&quot; being published in English as &quot;The Scary Sleepover&quot;.

In addition, for years he has been writing also many book reviews for various daily papers and magazines. He is a member of VS Berlin (writers&#x27; association within the German trade union &quot;ver.di&quot;). He established the freely accessible online review archives Buechernachlese in 2000. Under this have to be called over 1,500 of his book reviews and short indications for fiction and poetry, non-fiction book as well as children&#x27;s books and literature for young people. In 2010 he founded the book label &quot;Edition Gegenwind&quot;, which is meanwhile also used by other well known German writers such as Gabriele Beyerlein, Thomas Fuchs, Manfred Schlüter and Christa Zeuch. Together they now belong to a community of authors, who under this book label above all republish out of stock books written by themselves.

<text>Coventry University is a public research university in Coventry, England. The origins of Coventry University can be linked to the Coventry School of Design in 1843. It was known as Lanchester Polytechnic from 1970 until 1987, and then as Coventry Polytechnic until it gained university status in 1992.

Coventry is the larger of the two universities in the city, the other being the University of Warwick. The Coventry University Group operates campuses in Coventry, Scarborough, London and Wrocław. It has two principal campuses: one in the centre of Coventry where the majority of its operations are located, and one in Central London which focuses on business and management courses. Coventry also governs the higher education institutions CU Coventry, CU Scarborough and CU London. Its colleges, which are made up of schools and departments, run around 300 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Across the university there are 11 research centres which specialise in different fields, from agroecology and peace studies to future of transport.

It is the UK&#x27;s fastest growing university and the country&#x27;s fourth largest overall. The annual income of the institution for 2022–23 was £480.6 million of which £17.5 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £483.4 million. The university holds an overall Gold rating in the 2023 Teaching Excellence Framework. Coventry is a member of the University Alliance mission group.

==History==
The origins of Coventry University can be traced back to the founding of the Coventry School of Design in 1843. Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the Education Act 1902. One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art.

In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training which the existing Coventry Technical College (now City College Coventry) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after the car engineer Frederick Lanchester.

In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of Rugby, amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher. The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity (it was often confused with both Lancaster and Manchester), notably when none of the contestants on the BBC Radio 4 general knowledge show &quot;Brain of Britain&quot; could give its correct location. The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the Birmingham pub bombings in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. Lanchester Polytechnic was renamed &quot;Coventry Polytechnic&quot; in 1987, and when the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University.

In 2010, a campus in London was established to further attract international students to the university. In 2012 &quot;Coventry University College&quot; was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees.

As of 2017 Coventry is the highest-ranked modern university in the UK in both the Guardian University Guide – in which it ranks 12th overall – and the Complete University Guide. It also places in the top 200 in the Times Higher Education Young University Rankings 2017, which ranks universities around the world that are aged 50 years or under.

In July 2017, the university announced Margaret Casely-Hayford as its new chancellor, replacing Sir John Egan.

The campus in Coventry is undergoing a £430 million investment programme for the period up to 2022, with a new £37 million science and health building and £73 million student accommodation complex – opened in 2017 and 2018 respectively – central to the development scheme.

In September 2019, Coventry purchased the 22-acre farm Ryton Organic Gardens from the charity Garden Organic, who remains on site as a tenant along with the Heritage Seed Library and a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme &#x27;5-Acre CSA&#x27; sitting alongside the university&#x27;s own Centre for Agroecology, Water and Resilience.

==Campuses==

===Coventry campus===

Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to Coventry Cathedral and the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings, converted structures, and those inherited from its predecessor institutions.

The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub which opened in August 2011. The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students’ Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by Sodexo In September 2012, a new £55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale Harrier jump jet, a wind tunnel and flight simulators. The Hub was awarded a BREEAM &#x27;excellent&#x27; rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as grey-water harvesting, a biomass boiler and a green roof. The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a £160 million redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years.

Coventry&#x27;s £20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. It was officially opened by Princess Anne in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000 monographs, and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building.

There are two converted buildings on the campus. A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university&#x27;s library now houses the Coventry Business School, and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the School of Media and Performing Arts, now part of the College of Arts and Society, and formerly part of the Coventry School of Art and Design.

To the south of the main campus is the Coventry University Technology Park, a business park owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university, and through which several of the university&#x27;s commercial subsidiary operations provide business services to local and national organisations. Tenants of the park are small businesses which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university&#x27;s library. The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, and a digital lab for serious game and other technology development.

Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. These include former Coventry-based automotive company Armstrong Siddeley; Shakespearean actress Ellen Terry; Coventry-based automotive pioneer Frederick Lanchester; Victorian novelist, critic and poet George Eliot; the father of the bicycle industry James Starley (building demolished in early 2020); former MP for Coventry East and political journalist Richard Crossman; artist Graham Sutherland; and founder of the Morris Motors automotive manufacturer William Morris.

The College of Engineering, Environment &amp; Science has a former RAF Harrier T.4 aircraft, tail number XW270, used as a teaching aid.

===CU Coventry===
CU Coventry was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing full-time and part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. CU Coventry is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. Courses offered are flexible, meaning that tuition fees at the institution are often lower than the maximum £16,000 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. The part-time nature of many of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as evenings and weekends.

=== CU London ===
CU London was established as a new campus in 2017, offering a range of full-time and part-time courses in Dagenham, East London. Located in the former Dagenham Civic Centre, the campus focuses on &quot;high quality, low-cost, career-focused&quot; education, which is flexibly structured to fit around students’ lives. CU London has offered over £95,000 in bursaries and scholarships to local students and schools in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham to make higher education more accessible.

From November 2020, CU London also operates from a new campus at 6 Mitre Passage, on the Greenwich Peninsula. This was set up to cater to students of the former Greenwich School of Management, following its closure, as well as to new enrolments.

===CU Scarborough===
The university opened a new facility, CU Scarborough, in Scarborough, North Yorkshire in 2016, as part of a new £45 million development, in the Weaponess area of the town. The university contributed £12 million towards the project. Courses include Law, Science &amp; Engineering. The site also incorporates a new sports and leisure village and University Technical College (UTC), for 14–18-year-olds.

=== Coventry University London ===
Coventry University&#x27;s London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities&#x27; international reputation. The campus operates out of University House, 109–117 Middlesex Street in the City of London, almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry.

===Coventry University Wrocław===

Coventry University Wrocław is a campus opened in September 2020, offering courses taught in English, including IT, cybersecurity, business, and aviation management with more courses to follow in 2023. The university plans to accept 160 students in the first year. It is the first foreign university in Poland and will offer student exchange programs with Coventry University UK campuses.

==Structure and organisation==

The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three Pro Vice-Chancellors. The position of Vice-Chancellor has been occupied, currently, by John Latham since March 2014.

Coventry is a member of the University Alliance mission group, of which Latham is a former chair.

===Colleges and schools===

Coventry University is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1960. Commercial activities are undertaken by six subsidiaries wholly owned by the university. These subsidiaries are together known as the Coventry University Group, and deliver education, business support, partnership and consultancy, and serious game development to local and national organisations.

==Academic profile==

Coventry offers more than 130 undergraduate degrees and 100 postgraduate degrees over its four faculties, as well as qualifications such as foundation degrees and Higher National Diplomas (HNDs). It has introduced the teaching of disaster management at undergraduate level (the first such course in the UK) as well as parapsychology and health journalism at the postgraduate level.

The university&#x27;s student body in consisted of students: undergraduates and postgraduates. Part-time students in 2013–14 made up 15% of undergraduates and 39% of postgraduates. The drop-out rate for first year undergraduates is 8.9% and the undergraduate intake from state schools is 97%. The university employs over 1,800 academic staff and is the fourth largest employer in Coventry.

Tuition fees for undergraduate students at the university are variable and range from £7,500 to £9,000 depending on the degree programme, following the United Kingdom government&#x27;s decision in 2010 to raise the maximum limit universities can charge UK and EU students. The university cited the variable fee structure in explaining the rise in applications received for 2012 compared to the previous year, despite an overall national fall.

===Research===
The Research Assessment Exercise 2008 classed that research conducted by the university in the subjects ‘Allied Health Professions and Studies’, ‘Computer Science and Informatics’, ‘Electrical and Electronic Engineering’, ‘Library and Information Management’, ‘Politics and International Studies’, ‘Social Work and Social Policy &amp; Administration’, and ‘Art and Design’ contained elements of &#x27;world-leading&#x27; research.

It was founded in 2003, when the Recreational Products Division of Bombardier Inc. was spun off and sold to a group of investors consisting of Bain Capital, the Bombardier-Beaudoin family and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. Bombardier Inc., was founded in 1942 as &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée&quot; (Bombardier Snowmobile Limited) by Joseph-Armand Bombardier at Valcourt in the Eastern Townships, Quebec.

, BRP had about 5,500 employees; its revenues in 2007 were above US$2.5 billion. BRP has manufacturing facilities in Canada, the United States (Wisconsin, Illinois, North Carolina, Arkansas, Michigan and Minnesota), Mexico, Finland, and Austria. The company&#x27;s products are sold in more than 100 countries, some of which have their own direct-sales network.

BRP&#x27;s products include the Ski-Doo and Lynx snowmobiles, Can-Am ATVs and Can-Am motorcycles, Sea-Doo personal watercraft, and Rotax engines. The Ski-Doo was ranked 17th place on CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Canadian Invention&quot; in 2007.

==History==
In January 1934, a blizzard prevented Joseph-Armand Bombardier from reaching the nearest hospital in time to save his two-year-old son, Yvon, who died from appendicitis complicated by peritonitis.

Bombardier was a mechanic who dreamed of building a vehicle that could &quot;float on snow&quot;. In 1935, in a repair shop in Valcourt, Quebec, he designed and produced the first snowmobile using a drive system he developed that revolutionized travel in snow and swampy conditions.

In 1937, he patented and sold 12 of the 7-passenger &quot;B7&quot; snow coaches. They were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. In 1941, Bombardier opened a factory in Valcourt.

In 1942, &quot;L&#x27;Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée&quot; (&quot;Bombardier Snow Car Limited&quot;) was founded in Valcourt.

During World War II, the Government of Canada issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. The company then shifted its focus to the arms industry.

In 1947, during a blizzard in Saskatchewan, the company received positive press coverage when army snowmobiles resupplied isolated radio communication towers.

In 1948, the Government of Quebec passed a law requiring all roads to be cleared of snow; Bombardier&#x27;s sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized for use on municipal sidewalks, replacing horse-drawn vehicles, then by making all-terrain vehicles for the mining, petroleum, and forestry industries.

The machines had removable front skis that could be replaced with front wheels for use on paved or hard surfaces, thus providing greater utility to his large snowmobiles. In 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel, and these vehicles were powered by Chrysler flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions.

In the early 1950s, Bombardier focused on developing a snowmobile for one or two passengers. A breakthrough occurred in 1957 when Bombardier developed a one-piece molded rubber continuous track with enough durability to provide snow-gripping traction for lightweight vehicles. The vehicle was called the &quot;Ski-Dog&quot; because it was meant to replace the dog sled for hunters and trappers. However, in 1958, &quot;Ski-Doo&quot; was accidentally painted on the first prototype, and immediately became the popular name.

The public soon discovered the fun of speedy vehicles zooming over snow, and a new winter sport was born, centered in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. Bombardier slowed promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from crowding out other company products, while still dominating the snowmobile industry against competitors Polaris Industries and Arctic Cat.

In 1963, Roski was created in Roxton Falls, Quebec as a manufacturer of composite parts for the Ski-Doo. In the 1960s, V-8 engines were added.

On February 18, 1964, J. Armand Bombardier died of cancer at age 56. Until then, he oversaw all areas of operation and controlled the research department, making all the drawings himself. The younger generation took over, led by Armand&#x27;s sons and sons-in-law, reorganizing and decentralizing the company. The company adopted computer inventory, accounting, and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff. That year, a survey was mailed to Ski-Doo owners to find out how the product was being used. Germain Bombardier, who had been groomed by his father, took over the company upon his father&#x27;s death in 1964. He quit and sold his shares in 1966 after a disagreement with other family members. Laurent Beaudoin, the son-in-law of the founder, then became president, a position he held until 1999.

In 1967, the company was renamed &quot;Bombardier Limited&quot;. By that time, the snowmobiles were very useful for the Inuit.

In 1968, Clayton Jacobson II invented the jet ski and the company licensed his patents to create the Sea-Doo personal watercraft.

On January 23, 1969, the company became a public company, listing on the Montreal Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 1969–1970, the standard round windows reminiscent of portholes were replaced with larger rectangular windows that provided more interior light. A change was made to the Chrysler Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions.

In 1970, the company acquired Rotax, an engine manufacturer based in Gunskirchen, Austria.

In 1971, Bombardier acquired Moto-Ski. Also in 1971, Bombardier launched Operation SnoPlan, a program to promote snowmobile safety after a mounting death toll due to snowmobile accidents.

In the 1970s, the company began producing Can-Am motorcycles, which included Rotax engines.

By 1990, the first product of the company, the Ski-Doo snowmobile, had become its weakest part, producing deficits and high inventories.  

In 2001 Bombardier purchased the Evinrude Outboard Motors and Johnson Outboards trade names for the insolvent Outboard Marine Corporation.

In 2003, the company sold Bombardier Recreational Products to a group of investors: Bain Capital (50%), Bombardier Family (35%) and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (15%) for $875 million.

==Snowmobiles==
Before the start of the company&#x27;s development of track vehicles, Joseph-Armand Bombardier experimented with propeller-driven aerosleds. His work with snowplane designs can be traced to before 1920. He quickly abandoned his efforts to develop a snowplane and turned his inventive skills to tracked vehicles.

From the start, the company made truck-sized half-track vehicles, with skis in the front and caterpillar tracks in the rear, designed for the worst winter conditions of the flatland Canadian countryside. After producing half-tracks in World War II for the Canadian Army, the company experimented with new forms of track systems and developed an all-tracked, heavy duty vehicle designed for logging and mining operations in extreme wilderness conditions, such as heavy snow or semiliquid muskeg. They produced it under the name Muskeg tractor.

Each track is composed of two or more rubber belts joined into a loop. The loops are held together with interior wheel guides and exterior cleats, commonly called grousers. The tracks are driven by a large drive sprocket that engages the grousers in sequence and causes the track to rotate. Two belt tracks were common on early model Bombardiers and muskeg machines. For deep-snow use, wider tracks, employing additional belts, are used for added flotation over the snow.

The research for the track base made it possible to produce a small, continuous-rubber track for the light one- or two-person snowmobile the founder of the company had dreamed about during his teen years. This led to the invention of snowmobiles.

The company created the snowmobile market, and held its own after international competitors entered the market in the late 1960s. From the 1940s through the early 1970s, Bombardier built the most successful snowcat models ever produced by any snowcat manufacturer. The B12 seated 12 people, and the C18 seated 18. Both were similar in design with long tracks in the rear and skis used to steer the vehicle. The B12 and C18 were very fast for their day, with speeds over the snow exceeding 30 miles per hour. Most historic and most modern snowcats have a top speed of barely 20 mph. The Bombardier B12 and C18 were probably the precursors to the more modern snow coach used by resorts for transporting tourists. In their day, the B12 and C18 vehicles were used as school buses, mail delivery and emergency vehicles in northern United States and Canada, and were best suited to flat land conditions, frozen roadways, or frozen lakes. While more than 3,000 of the Bombardier B12/C18 variants were produced, Bombardier had competitors in both the North American and world markets. Most of the Bombardier production stayed in North American. The front ski design was incapable of being used in deep snow and rough ground conditions, which opened the door for the development of dual-track and quad-track snowcats. Unfortunately, the front ski design was not easily adapted to change for other ground conditions, so while it was successful on flat lands, frozen lakes, and snow-covered roads, it could not compete on rough, off-road conditions. The combination of the lack of design flexibility, incompatibility with off-road conditions, and the advent of modern snowplowing practices of public roadways beginning in the 1950s, and becoming common in remote areas by the 1960s, probably led to the demise of the B12/C18 design. Today, B12s are still in used in large-scale ice fishing in northern Canada.

Notable competitors included the Aktiv Snow Trac ST4 from Sweden, Thiokol, and Tucker Sno-Cat from the USA. The Snow Trac was produced, virtually unchanged, until 1981, but it was successful, with over 2,000 units sold, and it was used all over the globe for exploration and commercial purposes, as well as the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. Tucker Sno-Cat grew to become one of the world&#x27;s largest builders of these vehicles, and produces a range of large commercial and exploration vehicles from its location in Medford, Oregon, USA. Thiokol produced popular units, notably the Imp, Super Imp, and Spryte models, but changed ownership and name several times before going out of business in 2000 as the Logan Machine Company and manufacturer of the LMC brand.

==Development of the small snowmobile==

Armand dreamed of developing a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company&#x27;s other tracked vehicles. But by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come on the market. Armand resumed his efforts to build a &quot;miniature&quot; snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father&#x27;s mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.

The Ski-Doo was intended to be named the &quot;Ski-Dog&quot; because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By accident, a printer misinterpreted the name and printed &quot;Ski-Doo&quot; in the first sales brochure. Public interest in the small snowmobiles grew quickly. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products but still dominate the entire snowmobile industry. The snowmobiles produced earned a better reputation than the rival Polaris and Arctic Cat brands of motor sleds. In 1971, Bombardier completed the purchase of the Moto-Ski company to expand the Ski-Doo line and eliminate a competitor from the marketplace.

In the mid 1990s, some of the sleds made by Ski-Doo were the Formula III, Mach 1, and Mach Z with Rotax engines. While it is a commonly held misconception that all Ski-Doo snowmobiles were powered by rotary valved engines, this is not true. Only two cylinder Rotax engines were equipped with rotary valves. As a rule, the later rotary valved sleds were liquid cooled as well. Fan cooled sleds were usually piston port (2-stroke) induction. Sleds such as the formula III, later model mach-1&#x27;s and the mach Z were powered by three cylinder, 2-stroke, Rotax engines. In 1994 the company produced the first snowmobile equipped specifically for mountain riding, the Ski-Doo Summit. Ski-Doo snowmobiles have been competitive for performance and in the marketplace, taking national titles in racing events from Sno-X to hill-climbing. In 1999 Ski-Doo introduced the ZX aluminum chassis which was lighter weight with better suspension and thus successful in sno-cross competition. In 2003 Ski-Doo introduced rider-forward REV chassis, which changed the sport and was followed by other manufacturers. In 2008 Ski-Doo introduced the XP chassis, which moved the rider further forward with major weight reduction. The XP was the lightest machine available, with power-to-weight ratios in the Summit models for the first time under 3 lb per HP.

For the 2017 snow year, Ski-Doo will release its most powerful engine. The Rotax 850 cc &quot;Etec&quot; engine. The engine produces 10 more horsepower (170 hp) than its predecessor, it is also more efficient 40 percent less oil burn than the previous Etec. and 30 percent quicker throttle response; this engine paired with the new SP chassis which moves the rider even further forward and provides a big weight reduction over the XP chassis. This makes the 2017 the most capable snowmobile ever, reaching speed of upwards of 120 mph in the MXZ models.

==Motorcycles and ATVs==

During the 1970s, Bombardier built the Can-Am brand of off-road competition motorcycles designed for motocross and enduro with Rotax engines displacing 125, 175, 248, 366, 500 and 800 cc. The bikes competed successfully in professional racing with Gary Jones winning the 1974 US 250cc AMA motocross national championship. In 1983, Bombardier licensed the brand and outsourced development and production of the Can-Am motorcycles to Armstrong-CCM Motorcycles of Lancashire, England. 1987 was the last model year for Can-Am.

In 2007 Bombardier renamed their all-terrain vehicle line of products Can-Am. Can-am Off-Road has seven models of ATVs, the Outlander, the Renegade, the Commander, The Maverick, the DS, the Traxter, the Quest, and the Rally. 

The Traxter and Quest (no longer in production) had two engine sizes 500cc and 650cc. The Rally (also no longer in production) was available with a 200cc engine. The Outlander is a utility style ATV available in multiple engine sizes, including 400cc and 450cc single cylinder and 500cc, 570cc, 650cc, 800cc, 850cc and 1000cc V-Twin engines. The Outlander MAX is available for 2-up riding and the Outlander X-MR is built specifically for mud riding. The Renegade is also available with multiple engine choices, a 500cc, 570cc, 800cc, 850cc or 1000cc V-Twin engine. The Renegade X-XC is a separate trim level built specifically for cross country racing. The Outlander 800R X-XC is a version of the Renegade with the same trim level for cross country racing and non-racing trail riding. 

The XT-P is the modern outlander XXC and features the XT package with front sway bar and beadlock wheels. The 1000cc engine was introduced into the quad classification in the 2012 model year for both the Outlander and the Renegade series. The DS has four engine choices, a 450cc, 250cc, 90cc and 70cc. A 650cc engine was once available but has since been discontinued. An &quot;X&quot; trim level is available for the DS-450 and the DS-90. The Commander is a SSV or Side by side introduced for 2010 with either 800cc or 1000cc engines. 

Commander has several trim levels, including XT, X and LTD (Limited) at the time the only engine option for the extra packages was the 1000. The XT had upgraded wheels, winch, front bumper and upgraded gauge and steering wheel. The X package had Bumpers, rock sliders, XT gauge and steering wheel, X package seats, and beadlock wheels. Commander Limited includes air ride suspension, an am/fm radio with four speakers, an iPod adapter, XT package and built-in touch screen GPS. All Can Am ATVs except the DS-70 and the DS-90 feature four-stroke Rotax engines. The maverick side by side was introduced to stand up to the Commander&#x27;s rival the Polaris RZR XP 900. 

The Maverick has an updated version of the commander&#x27;s 1000cc V-Twin Rotax engine (1000R) this engine had a massive 101 horsepower. This was achieved by using high flow dynamics to increase exhaust and air flow. The Maverick comes in six packages (at February 2014) Base, XRS, XRS DPS, XMR, X ds, and X ds Turbo. In the X ds lineup Can Am brought the first factory installed turbocharged engine to the industry. The turbo boosts the horsepower of the Maverick from 101 horsepower to 121 horsepower.

==Invention of the three-wheeled roadster==

In 2007, BRP announced the launch of a new three-wheeled roadster called the Spyder, which was released in Q4 2007 under the Can-Am brand. This is the first vehicle from BRP to go on the road. It was described as part motorcycle and part roadster; the latter is how the company refers to it. The Guinness World Record for the “Largest Parade of Can-Am Spyder Roadsters” was established in 2010 when 438 Can-Am Spyders paraded around Magog, Quebec. In 2018, the Can-Am Ryker was launched as a simpler, more easygoing counterpart to the Spyder.

==Sailboats==


Beginning in the 1970s, Bombardier also built several sailboat models, including the Invitation sailboat, with hull length of ; the Bombardier 3.8, with hull length of ; the Bombardier 4.8 and the Bombardier 7.6 keelboat.

==Diversification==
In the 1970s and 1980s, the company diversified into railway and aeronautical products and became a multinational corporation known as Bombardier Inc.

==Restructuring==
During restructuring operations in 2003, the original snowmobile and tracked utility vehicle division was spun off as a separate company, with majority ownership transferred to Bain Capital. Though the company is a major manufacturer of two stroke engines and four stroke motors for several industries it is better known for its consumer recreational products.

They now make Ski-Doo and Lynx brand snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, Sea-Doo personal water craft, jet boats, and Evinrude outboard motors (through the purchase of Outboard Marine Corporation). Bombardier Recreational Products no longer sells outboards under the Johnson brand since 2007, as they have moved all sales entirely to Evinrude Outboard Motors. They support existing Johnson outboard motors through servicing and parts. They also produce motorcycle motors, kart motors, and small airplane motors, through their Rotax division.

In December 2004, Bombardier Recreational Products Inc, sold the industrial vehicles division to the Camoplast of Sherbrooke, Quebec. The industrial vehicles division made tracked vehicles such as snowcats, sidewalk snow removal tractors, and Tracked Utility Vehicles, including the descendant of their original Muskeg tractor.

In October 2007, Bombardier Recreational Products Inc. ordered at least some U.S. ATV dealerships to stop selling vehicles to Canadian customers, as the sales were a violation of dealer agreements to respect assigned geographic boundaries. Bombardier also announced that the warranty on any craft purchased by a Canadian in the United States – even if the purchase was initially made by an American - would be void. Newspaper articles revealed that some models were being sold in Canada for as much as 40% above prices in the U.S.

In September 2012, the company announced that it would exit the sport boat business citing a decline in global sales in the marine industry. This meant the loss of 350 jobs, including most of those at a plant in Benton, Illinois.

On May 29, 2013, the company announced the closing of an initial public offering of 12,200,000 subordinate voting shares of the company at a price of $21.50 per share resulting in gross proceeds to the company of approximately $262,300,000. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay outstanding loans. The company&#x27;s shares now trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

On May 27, 2020, the company announced the discontinuation of its Evinrude E-TEC and E-TEC G2 outboard engines, the repurposing of its Sturtevant, WI, facility, and the closing of its Alumacraft operations in Arkadelphia, AR. The company stated that it had signed an agreement with Mercury Marine to support boat packages and continue to supply outboard engines to BRP boat brands.

== Bombardier Museum ==
The Museum of Ingenuity J. Armand Bombardier is a museum in Valcourt, Quebec dedicated to the life of Joseph-Armand Bombardier and the snowmobile industry. Opened in 1971, with renovations in 1990, the museum is professionally curated and features Ski-Doos, other industrial designs, and a selection of books, booklets and other items of interest to snowmobile enthusiasts.

The museum includes the original garage &quot;factory&quot; where the first snowmobile was built. The garage was removed from its original location in Valcourt and moved to its site at the museum, which is located blocks away from the Bombardier Recreational Products factory.

<text>Charles de Bourbon (1401 – 4 December 1456) was the oldest son of John I, Duke of Bourbon and Marie, Duchess of Auvergne.

==Biography==
Charles was Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis from 1424, and Duke of Bourbon and Auvergne from 1434 to his death, although due to the imprisonment of his father after the Battle of Agincourt, he acquired control of the duchy more than eighteen years before his father&#x27;s death.

In 1425, Charles renewed his earlier betrothal by marrying Agnes of Burgundy (1407–1476), daughter of John the Fearless.

Charles served with distinction in the Royal army during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, while nevertheless maintaining a truce with his brother-in-law and otherwise enemy, Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. Both dukes were reconciled and signed an alliance by 1440. He was present at the coronation of Charles VII where he fulfilled the function of a peer and conferred knighthood.

Despite this service, he took part in the &quot;Praguerie&quot; (a revolt by the French nobles against Charles VII) in 1439–1440. When the revolt collapsed, he was forced to beg for mercy from the King, and was stripped of some of his lands. He died on his estates at Château de Moulins in 1456.

==Children==
Charles and Agnes had eleven children:
* John of Bourbon (1426–1488), Duke of Bourbon
* Marie de Bourbon (1428–1448), married in 1444 John II, Duke of Lorraine
* Philip of Bourbon (1430–1440), Lord of Beaujeu
* Charles of Bourbon (Château de Moulins 1433–1488, Lyon), Cardinal and Archbishop of Lyon and Duke of Bourbon
* Isabella of Bourbon (1434–1465), married Charles, Duke of Burgundy
* Peter of Bourbon, (1438–1503, Château de Moulins), Duke of Bourbon
* Louis of Bourbon (1438 – August 30, 1482, murdered), Prince-Bishop of Liège
* Margaret of Bourbon (February 5, 1439 – 1483, Château du Pont-Ains), married in Moulins on April 6, 1472, Philip II, Duke of Savoy
* Catherine of Bourbon (Liège, 1440 – May 21, 1469, Nijmegen), married on December 28, 1463, in Bruges Adolf II, Duke of Guelders
* Joanna of Bourbon (1442–1493, Brussels), married in Brussels in 1467 John II of Chalon, Prince of Orange
* James of Bourbon (1445–1468, Bruges), unmarried.

<text>The &quot;radio industry&quot; is a generic term for any companies or public service providers who are involved with the broadcast of radio stations or ancillary services.

Radio broadcasters can be broken into at least two different groups:

Public service broadcasters are funded in whole or in part through public money. This may be through money received directly from the government, or, as in the UK, through a license fee. The license fee is typically protected by law and set by the government, and is required for any household which contains equipment which can be used to receive a TV signal.

Commercial broadcasters (also called Independent Local Radio in the UK) are largely funded through the sales of advertising spots on their radio station. Commercial stations are often quite local, and may have some public service commitments within their permit.

<doc id="703419" wikidata="Q12687532" url="?curid=703419" title="Indian Arrival Day">
<text>Indian Arrival Day is a holiday celebrated on various days in the nations of the Caribbean, Fiji, South Africa and Mauritius, commemorating the arrival of people from India and the wider subcontinent to their respective nations as indentured laborers brought by European colonial authorities and their agents. In Guyana, Mauritius, Fiji and Trinidad and Tobago, where it started, it is an official public holiday.

== By country ==
===Fiji===
A resolution was passed in public discussion that every year on 14 May as to be Girmit Remembrance Day. 14 May is the day that the &quot;Leonidas&quot; (the first ship of indentured Indians) arrived in Fiji in 1879. Throughout the country each year there are celebrations in memory of the Girmityas and Indian culture.

===Grenada===
The 100th anniversary of the first arrival of Indians in Grenada was commemorated in 1957. This was the first ever commemoration of the day in Grenada. The next commemoration would occur more than five decades later in 2009. On 29 April 2009, the Government of Grenada declared that 1 May would officially be designated as Indian Arrival Day and observed annually alongside the existing Labour Day. The date was already a public holiday in Grenada, on account of Labour Day. The Government also announced that Boucherie Road, the road leading to the site of the arrival of the &quot;Maidstone&quot;, would be officially renamed Maidstone Road to honour the arrival of Indians in Grenada. The renaming was officially carried out in a ceremony at 10:30 AM at La Fortune Junction, St. Patrick on 2 May 2009. Governor General Sir Carlyle Glean unveiled a granite plaque commemorating the arrival of the first Indians in Grenada. The plaque bears the inscription, &quot;On 1st May 1857, in this bay the sailing vessel &quot;Maidstone&quot; anchored and landed 287 passengers having left India three months earlier, with 304 passengers. Between the years 1857 and 1890 other ships anchored in this and other bays bringing a total of 3,200 persons from India to work as agricultural indentured labourers in Grenada. This monument is dedicated to those who became the genesis of the Indo-Grenadian population of our nation&quot;.

===Guyana===
In Guyana the holiday is celebrated in May commemorating the first arrival of indentured labourers from India to the country, on May 5, 1838. On this day, the workers arrived in Guyana to work in sugar plantations. Their descendants today comprise 44 per cent of Guyana&#x27;s population of over 750,000.

===Jamaica===
In 1995, the Government of Jamaica proclaimed 10 May, Indian Heritage Day, in recognition of the Indians&#x27; contribution to the social and economic development of the country. The arrival of the Indians more than 170 years ago is commemorated in stamps.

===Mauritius===
In Mauritius, the holiday is celebrated on 2 November to commemorate the arrival of Indian labourers. 65.8% of the total population is of Indian origins with Mauritius being the only African country with a Hindu majority. This date is specifically chosen as the ship &quot;Atlas&quot; arrived in Mauritius on Sunday 2 November 1834 with the first cargo of 36 Hill Coolies or indentured labourers of the Dhangar caste, organised by the Hunter-Arbuthnot &amp; Company.

=== Saint Lucia ===
The Indian Diaspora of St. Lucia, an association promoting Indo-Saint Lucian heritage, organized the first Indian Arrival Day celebrations in Saint Lucia on 6 May 2013. The association is campaigning for the Saint Lucian government to officially declare 6 May as Indian Arrival Day. Many other Caribbean nations observe Indian Arrival Day annually to commemorate the date when the first Indians arrived in their respective countries.

===Saint Vincent and the Grenadines===
The Parliament of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines enacted an Act of Parliament on 26 March 2007 officially declaring 1 June as Indian Arrival Day. The first official commemoration of the event was held on 1 June that year. The day is marked annually by a re-enactment of the landing of Indians at Indian Bay, Kingstown, followed by a procession to Heritage Square. Several Indian cultural events are also held to mark the occasion. The first International Indian Diaspora Conference was held for the first time on 1–3 June 2012. It was organized by the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Chapter of the Global Organization of People of Indian Origin International (GOPIO-SVG), in partnership with the SVG Indian Heritage Foundation, and under the patronage of the SVG Ministry of Tourism and Culture. This was the first international conference for the Indian diaspora held in the country. Similar conferences had been held in other Caribbean nations since 1975.

The Government of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines officially designated 7 October as Indian Heritage Day.

===Suriname===
In Suriname, Indian Arrival Day (Prawas Din) is celebrated on 5 June 1873. On this day a ship named &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot;, arrived in Paramaribo carrying the first batch of 399 Indian Indenture Labours.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
In Trinidad and Tobago, Indian Arrival Day is celebrated on 30 May. It commemorates the arrival of the first indentured labourers from India in May 1845 on a ship named &quot;Fatel Razack&quot; after a journey of five months, carrying 275 Indians. Trinidad and Tobago was the first country to start this holiday.

== History ==

Indian Arrival Day was first celebrated in Skinner Park, San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, as the East Indian Centenary on 30 May 1945 which marked the hundredth anniversary of the coming of Indians to Trinidad. The Acting Governor representing the Government of the United Kingdom attended indicating the significance of the observance. Other local dignitaries who addressed the large crowd included Timothy Roodal, George F. Fitzpatrick, Adrian Cola Rienzi, and Murli J. Kirpalani. Greetings were also read from Mahatma Gandhi, Lord Wavell and Colonel Stanley, the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

After the 1945 Centenary extravaganza, however, the celebration of the anniversary of 30 May gradually declined. By the 1950s, the Indians who were on the &quot;Fatel Razack&quot; as immigrants to Trinidad and Tobago who were &quot;coolie&quot; indentured labourers were long gone. By the early seventies, the only Indian group was the Hindu Divine Life Society of Chaguanas who was staging an annual procession and ceremony under the name Indian Emigration Day.

Indian Emigration Day, as it was called then, had been celebrated by various organizations after 1945 with limited success. By 1973 the latest was organized by the Divine Life Society, which had organized small annual processions in Chaguanas for Indian Emigration Day. By the late seventies even that small remembrance was dwindling.

In 1976 the Indian Revival and Reform Association (IRRA) was formed. They were concerned about racism against Indians and were interested in developing ideas, writing pamphlets to bring about an Indian revival and renewed pride in Indian heritage and Indian culture. The IRRA wanted to preserve the good things about Indian heritage and reform the ones that were no longer useful or relevant. The anniversary of the coming of Indians to Guyana was one of the good things that came to the IRRA notice.

In 1977 IRRA formed committee was established to revive the memory of the coming of Indians to Trinidad on 30 May 1845; Indian Emigration Day. The initial historic Committee comprised Anand Rameshwar Singh, Khalique Khan, Ramdath Jagessar, Rajiv Sieunarine, Azamudeen &quot;Danny&quot; Jang, Michael Sankar and Rajesh Harricharan. The following year Rajnie Ramlakhan, Anand Maharaj and Ashok Gobin joined in the group&#x27;s celebration.

The first active step was taken in early 1978, when they produced and distributed a one-page pamphlet with the title &quot;Indian Emigration Day May 30, 1978&quot;. It gave a brief account of the coming of Indians in 1845, and the importance of the event. The names of the first pioneers on the Fatel Razack were listed, and there was a short description of the achievements of Indians in Trinidad since 1845. The Trinidad Express carried a press release, and the Trinidad Guardian printed an article by Kusha Haracksingh on the voyage of the Fatel Razack. Mastana Bahar dedicated a show to Indian Emigration Day. San Fernando Secondary School organized a celebration.

A major turning point occurred in 1979 when the group expanded by approaching the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha. The SDMS Secretary General Satnarayan Maharaj receptive to the idea, agreed to organize a major celebration at Lakshmi Girls College on 27 May 1979. IRRA and the SDMS in discussions agreed that Indians were no longer emigrants to Trinidad and Tobago, but citizens who had arrived 134 years before. Coming out of this discussion the name was then changed to Indian Arrival Day.

The 1979 celebration was a great success and included the presence of some of the original immigrants born in British India. Government ministers Sham and Kamal Mohammed were there, as was the Indian High Commissioner and Presbyterian Church moderator Idris Hamid. The event was widely covered by the local media and immediately knew about the event. In fact it took just two years and an idea to revive the memory of the Arrival of Indians in Trinidad and Tobago to awaken the entire Indian community in Trinidad and Tobago.

Subsequent years the Hindu Seva Sangh and other smaller groups approached the IRRA for guidance in developing in various communities throughout Trinidad and Tobago. By 1980 Indian Arrival Day celebrations were held at the Spring Village in Curepe, Cedros, Couva, Penal, Debe, San Juan, Chaguanas, and many other parts of the country. The National Joint Action Committee, the Catholic Church, other churches, libraries, masjids, mandirs, and schools at this point joined in the observances. In a short time, Indian Arrival Day was sweeping through the country. By 1985 there were more than 10 significant Indian Arrival Day celebrations taking place. The Hindu community took the lead in the development of the celebrations.

In 1991 Members of Parliament Trevor Sudama and Raymond Pallackdarrysingh first introduced to the House of Representatives the concept that Indian Arrival Day should be made a national public holiday. This call to make Indian Arrival Day a public holiday continued to be unheeded until 1995 Prime Minister Patrick Manning declared that the 150th Anniversary would be a public holiday called Indian Arrival Day, but thereafter the holiday will be called Arrival Day. The 1995 celebrations surpassed the 1945 celebrations with the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha having major celebrations in Trinidad and Tobago

In 1996 Prime Minister Basdeo Panday declared that 30 May would be known as Indian Arrival Day and not Arrival Day. However, in the birthplace of Indian Arrival Day – Trinidad and Tobago – there is a lobby to remove the word &#x27;Indian&#x27; from the name. In the 1990s the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha expanded the Indian Arrival Day celebrations and dubbed May as &quot;Indian Heritage Month&quot; which ends on Indian Arrival Day.

==Observances in different countries==

Since its establishment in Trinidad and Tobago, Indian Arrival Day has given rise to similar celebrations in Fiji, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, 
Mauritius, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Suriname, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. However, there is no similar celebration in Malaysia, Singapore, Réunion, Seychelles, Tanzania, Uganda, or Kenya, which are also home to somewhat large Indian-origin populations.

<doc id="703420" wikidata="Q720024" url="?curid=703420" title="John II, Duke of Bourbon">
<text>Jean (John) de Bourbon, Duke of Bourbon (1426 – 1 April 1488), sometimes referred to as John the Good and The Scourge of the English, was a son of Charles I of Bourbon and Agnes of Burgundy. He was Duke of Bourbon and Auvergne from 1456 to his death.

==Life==
John earned his nicknames &quot;John the Good&quot; and &quot;The Scourge of the English&quot; for his efforts in helping drive out the English from France. He commanded the victorious French army during the Battle of Formigny in 1450 and the Battle of Martignas in 1453.

He was made constable of France in 1483 by his brother Peter and sister-in-law Anne, to neutralize him as a threat to their regency.

In an effort to win discontented nobles back to his side, Louis XI of France made great efforts to give out magnificent gifts to certain individuals; John was a recipient of these overtures. According to contemporary chronicles, the King received John in Paris with &quot;honours, caresses, pardon, and gifts; everything was lavished upon him&quot;.

John is notable for making three brilliant alliances but leaving no legitimate issue.

==First marriage==
In 1447, his father, the Duke of Bourbon, had John married to a daughter of Charles VII, King of France, Joan of Valois. They were duly married at the Château de Moulins. They had no surviving issue.

==Second marriage==
In 1484 at St. Cloud to Catherine of Armagnac, daughter of Jacques of Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, who died in 1487 while giving birth to:
* John of Bourbon (Moulins, 1487 - 1487), styled Count of Clermont

==Third marriage==
In 1487 he married Jeanne of Bourbon-Vendôme, daughter of John of Bourbon, Count of Vendôme (from a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon), by whom he had one son:
* Louis of Bourbon (1488 - 1488), styled Count of Clermont

==Illegitimate issue==
By Louise of Albret, daughter of Jean I d&#x27;Albret (- 8 September 1494): 
* Charles, Bastard of Bourbon (- 1502), Viscount of Lavedan &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, married before 1462 Louise du Lion (- aft. 25 February 1505), Viscountess of Lavedan, and had issue, four sons

By Marguerite de Brunant: 
* Mathieu, the Great Bastard of Bourbon (- Château de Chambrou-en-Forez, 19 August 1505), Lord of Botheon and Lord and Baron of Roche-en-Régnier, unmarried and without issue

By unknown women: 
* Hector, Bastard of Bourbon (- 1502, bur. Toulouse), 15th Archbishop of Toulouse (1491 - 1502), 17th Bishop of Lavaur (1497 - 1500)
* Peter, Bastard of Bourbon, died young, unmarried and without issue
* Marie, Bastard of Bourbon (- 22 July 1482), married at the Château de Beseneins-en-Dombes in 1470 Jacques de Sainte Colombe, Lord of Thil
* Marguerite, Bastard of Bourbon (1445 - 1482), legitimized in 1464, married in Moulins in 1462 Jean de Ferrières (- 1497)

==Death and aftermath==
John died in 1488 at the Château de Moulins and was succeeded by his younger brother Charles. However, this succession was strongly contested due to the political strength of Peter and Anne. Within a span of days, Charles was forced to renounce his claims to the Bourbon lands to Peter in exchange for a financial settlement.

<text>Charles II, Duke of Bourbon (Château de Moulins, 1433 – 13 September 1488, Lyon), was Archbishop of Lyon from an early age and a French diplomat under the rule of Louis XI of France. He had a 2-week tenure as Duke of Bourbon in 1488, being ousted afterward by his younger brother and successor, Peter II, Duke of Bourbon.

==Biography==
Charles was the son of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, and Agnes of Burgundy. Being a younger son, he was appointed Canon of Lyon in 1443 and, on 6 June 1444, elected Archbishop of Lyon at the age of 11. This election followed the death of Amedée de Talaru and the renunciation of John III of Bourbon, illegitimate offspring of his grandfather John I, Duke of Bourbon. His office was confirmed by Pope Eugene IV on 14 November 1446, after the death of Geoffroy Vassal, Archbishop of Vienne who the pope had first appointed in disregard of the Pragmatic Sanction in 1444. Due to his age, Charles II&#x27;s archiepiscopate was administered in succession by Jean Rolin, bishop of Autun, from 1446 to 1447, Du Gué, bishop of Orléans, from 1447 to 1449, and John III of Bourbon, bishop of Puy, from 1449 to 1466.

At that time, he still maintained a good relationship with the King of France Louis XI, showing greater gusto for navigating the intrigue of secular politics than displaying the piety expected of his religious position. On account of these proclivities, after the conflict surrounding the League of the Public Weal in 1465, Louis XI sent Charles II with Thibaud of Luxembourg, Bishop of Mans as ambassadors to Pope Paul II, recently elected in 1464. On 7 January 1469 Charles II signed a royal letters patent as the king&#x27;s adviser, at Plessis-lèz-Tours, the latter&#x27;s main residence near Tours. As namesake, he was, along with Joan of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon and Edward of Westminster, godparent of the Dauphin Charles VIII. When Louis XI ended the Hundred Years&#x27; War in 1475, the archbishop assisted him in diplomatic matters while the king lives with Charles II at the Notre-Dame-de-la-Victoire-lès-Senlis abbey near Senlis. He arrives with Louis XI and his elder brother John II of Bourbon on 19 August at Picquigny to sign the eponymous treaty. Later, on 16 October, he signed in the abbey a letters patent to reestablish peaceable relations with Francis II, Duke of Brittany. Again, on 8 January 1476, as the head of the King&#x27;s Council, Charles II signs four letters patent, among them one concerning the liberty of the Gallican Church at Château de Plessis-lèz-Tours.

From 1472 to 1476, he was incumbent as the papal legate at Avignon though he only arrived there on 23 November 1473. On 23 May 1474 Pope Sixtus IV appointed his nephew Giuliano della Rovere as bishop of Avignon, and 2 years later as legate. This set Louis XI and the pope into conflict, with the royal army and papal troops coming to bear. On 15 June 1476, to resolve this difficulty, the king welcomed Giuliano della Rovere at Lyon, so that Charles II accepted the loss of the Avignon legation. This is the reason why, in 1476, he became the administrator of the diocese of Clermont and was made a Cardinal by Sixtus IV.

It seems that after leaving Avignon, Charles II followed again in the wake of Louis XI. The cardinal was present with the king at Arras on 18 March 1477, during the campaign following the death of Charles the Bold. He was in 1486 the first commendatory abbot of the Priory Notre-Dame de La Charité-sur-Loire.

He was also a noted patron of the arts, lavishing money on Lyon&#x27;s cathedral: the Bourbon chapel there, which he sponsored from 1486 onward (it was continued after his death by his brother, Peter II of Bourbon) was described as &quot;one of the marvels of decorative art in the 15th century&quot;.

He was also Duke of Bourbon and Auvergne for a short period of time in April 1488, succeeding his elder brother, John II, when the latter died on 1 April. This prompted Charles II, as his brother&#x27;s nearest heir, to claim the family inheritance in the Bourbonnais and Auvergne. The move was not tolerated by his younger brother, Peter, and Peter&#x27;s wife, Anne of France, the latter immediately taking possession of the Bourbon lands by force on 10 April. On 15 April, members of the King&#x27;s Council sent by Anne to &quot;console the Cardinal on the occasion of his brother&#x27;s death&quot;, forced him to sign a renunciation of any claims to the Bourbon lands, in exchange for a financial settlement. Charles then died later in the same year in mysterious circumstances, following a sudden collapse in a private house in Lyons. His brief tenure of the title during the period 1 April – 15 April would, however, be posthumously confirmed in 1505, when Charles de Montpensier acceded to the Duchy as Charles III.

Charles had an illegitimate daughter, with Gabrielle Bartine, named Isabelle (d. 1497). She was legitimized by Charles VIII and later married Gilbert of Chantelot, lord of La Chaise (Monétay-sur-Allier).

==In fiction==
Charles II of Bourbon features in Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot; (Chapter III: &quot;Monsieur the Cardinal&quot;). It evokes the titles and the parentage of Charles II in these words: &quot;Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, Archbishop and Comte of Lyon, Primate of the Gauls, was allied both to Louis XI, through his brother, Pierre, Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married the king&#x27;s eldest daughter, and to Charles the Bold through his mother, Agnes of Burgundy.&quot;

<text>The University of Central Lancashire (abbreviated UCLan) is a public university based in the city of Preston, Lancashire, England. It has its roots in &quot;The Institution For The Diffusion Of Useful Knowledge&quot;, founded in 1828. Previously known as Harris Art College, Preston Polytechnic and Lancashire Polytechnic, in 1992 it was granted university status by the Privy Council. The university is the 19th largest in the UK in terms of student numbers.

In December 2024, the university received approval from the Office for Students to change its name to the University of Lancashire, with the rebrand intended to come into effect by September 2025.

==History==

The Institution for the Diffusion of Knowledge was founded in 1828 by Joseph Livesey&#x27;s Temperance Society. The society was born from a pledge made by seven Preston working men (whose names can be seen on a plaque in the university&#x27;s library) to never again consume alcohol.

The institute was housed in a classical-revivalist building on Cannon Street, before eventually expanding under the endowment of a local lawyer, Edmund Robert Harris, who died in 1877. The expansion brought with it several new buildings and houses in the nearby Regent Street were purchased and demolished as a consequence. The institute became a regional centre for the arts and sciences.

As part of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 1897, the institute&#x27;s trustees paid the Victorian/Edwardian architect Henry Cheers to design the &quot;Victoria Jubilee Technical School&quot; (later known as the Harris Institute and now known as the Harris Building), to be built on Corporation Street. The foundation stone was laid in July 1895. Its goal was to provide local youths with a technical education in all areas. The building was progressive for the period, being powered entirely by electricity.

The institute existed in this state until 1932, when it changed its name to become the Harris Art College. It underwent further expansion and in 1952, and became the Harris College. In 1973, this became Preston Polytechnic, then the Lancashire Polytechnic in 1984. In 1992, full university status was awarded, and the University of Central Lancashire came into existence. The first chancellor of the university was Sir Francis Kennedy, and he was succeeded in 2001 by Sir Richard Evans. In 2016, Ranvir Singh became the new chancellor of the university.

The journalism division, now part of the School of Journalism and Media, is one of the oldest in the country, opening as part of the Harris College in 1962. In 1991, it became one of the first to teach journalism undergraduate degrees, with a strong emphasis on practical work.

In 2013, the School of Dentistry and the School of Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education merged to create the School of Medicine and Dentistry.

The university sponsored the now-defunct Wigan UTC, a university technical college which opened in September 2013.

The university applied for permission to change its name to the University of Lancashire in January 2024. 90% of respondents to the official consultation argued that the name change was confusing, particularly given the existence of Lancaster University. The Office for Students found that the change had &quot;the potential to be confusing for particular groups&quot; but ultimately approved it, citing a need to &quot;protect the institutional autonomy of English higher education providers, and the need to encourage competition&quot;.

==Campus==
The university is on an urban campus in Preston, with sites in Burnley and in Westlakes, West Cumbria (for Nursing and Medical programmes). A campus in Cyprus opened in October 2012.

Livesey House is named after temperance activist Joseph Livesey.

The university opened the new JB Firth building in September 2011, at a cost of £12.5m. It houses the School of Forensic and Applied Sciences, which includes subjects such as chemistry and forensic science. The new building has a 4,000 m2 teaching area, which includes six laboratories: two for chemistry undergraduate teaching, one for chemistry research, one analytical laboratory and two fire laboratories. The building was named after James Brierly Firth, a founder of forensic science in Britain.

The Sir Tom Finney Sports Centre opened, replacing the Foster Sports Centre, in 2011. It is a purpose-built indoor facility on the main campus and offers Students&#x27; Union sports clubs, instructor-led classes and individual training. Sports membership (including gym) is free for most students and discounted for staff.

Other key facilities include a £15m Media Factory with facilities for digital media and performing arts students, and a &#x27;business incubator&#x27;. The £5.3 million Allen Building incorporates facilities for students in the School of Medicine and Dentistry.

The university underwent a £200 million expansion programme, with several new buildings at the Preston main campus: 

* Social Spaces (open as of 2018). Two new social spaces, one located between the Harrington and Greenbank buildings and the other at the Foster building. These social spaces contain a range of relaxation space for students including; pool tables, table tennis tables and a bean bag area.
* Engineering Innovation Centre (opened September 2019). A £32 million purpose built teaching and exhibition space. The building contains several specialist labs as well as four flight simulators. It provides an integrated space for teaching, research and direct links with industry. The EIC secured £10.5 million worth of funding via the Lancashire Enterprise Partnerships’ Growth Deal with the Government. The new facility has also received £5.8 million from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and £5 million from HEFCE&#x27;s STEM Capital Fund.
* Oasis: Faith and Spirituality Centre (open as of May 2018). Consisting of multiple faith rooms, counselling and event space as well as roof terrace, this multi faith centre is to replace the existing one located on St. Peter&#x27;s Court.
* Student Centre and New Square (opened in 2021). This £57 million project was built with the purpose of creating a new campus reception building, housing several student services, meeting rooms, office space, event venues and a rooftop garden. A new square was also built in front of the student centre. Both the new square and student centre were constructed partially on the existing Adelphi roundabout and on the land once occupied by the Fylde building.

===Cyprus===
UCLan Cyprus is a branch campus of the University of Central Lancashire situated in Pyla, Larnaka. The campus opened in 2012 and is licensed and registered as a university in Cyprus. It is the only British private university in Cyprus. It accepts international students.

In 2012 the university opened UCLan Cyprus, a €53 million branch campus in Larnaka, Cyprus. It is the only private British university in Cyprus.

In 2013, following receipt of Chinese Ministry of Education approval and together with its partner Hebei University (HBU), the UCLan established the ‘Hebei/UCLan School of Media, Communication and Creative Industries’.

Initially the joint School will have non-independent status, meaning that although it will be a separate entity from HBU it will be wholly owned by it. The School will have 800 students, recruiting 200 per year for the four-year duration of the programmes. The intention is to grow to 1,600 students and then to focus on a broader range of subjects, targeting science in the second wave. When successfully operating at the expanded level, the School will apply for independent campus status.

<doc id="703427" wikidata="Q721680" url="?curid=703427" title="Peter II, Duke of Bourbon">
<text>Peter II, Duke of Bourbon (1 December 1438 – 10 October 1503 in Moulins), was the son of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, and Agnes of Burgundy, and a member of the House of Bourbon. He and his wife Anne of France ruled as regents during the minority of Charles VIII of France.

==Life, marriage, and royal favour==
A loyal and capable subject of the crown, Peter earned the grudging respect of Louis XI through his demonstration of the Bourbon family&#x27;s &quot;meekness and humility&quot;. Initially he was betrothed to Marie d&#x27;Orleans, sister of Louis, Duke of Orleans (the future Louis XII); Louis XI, who wanted to prevent such an alliance between two of the greatest feudal houses in France, broke the engagement, and took measures to bind both families closer to the crown.

A marriage between Peter and the King&#x27;s elder daughter, Anne, was arranged (as was another marriage between Louis of Orleans and Anne&#x27;s younger sister, Joan); as a mark of his favour, the King forced Peter&#x27;s older brother John II, Duke of Bourbon to grant the Bourbon fief of Beaujeu (Beaujolais) to Peter, who was also given a seat on the royal council. Peter and Anne were married on 3 November 1473.

==Regent of France and Duke of Bourbon==

At the time of Louis XI&#x27;s death in 1483, Peter was one of the few royal servants to have remained consistently in favour during the King&#x27;s reign, and it was to him that Louis, on his deathbed, granted guardianship over the new King, Charles VIII. Peter and his wife Anne immediately took up their duties, and began to position themselves as leaders of a regency government. The King was soon crowned, ending the need for a regency government. The thirteen-year-old king undertook personal rule of the kingdom, ostensibly on his own, but in reality guided by the Beaujeu couple.

Having assisted Anne in the governing of France, by 1488 Peter and his wife were building up a power base of their own in the Bourbonnais. Anne was already Countess of Gien, and Peter was Count of Clermont and La Marche, as well as Lord of Beaujeu; but the death of his eldest brother, John II, and the subsequent enforced renunciation of the family rights by his next eldest brother, Charles II, delivered the Bourbon inheritance (the Duchies of Bourbon and Auvergne, and the Counties of Forez and l&#x27;Isle-en-Jordain) into Peter&#x27;s hands.

The new Duke and Duchess of Bourbon then proceeded to add to these domains, adding Bourbon-Lancy in December 1488, and trading l&#x27;Isle-en-Jordain with the Armagnacs in June 1489 for Murat and the viscountcy of Carlat. These domains were granted to them by the King in absolute right – they would not revert to the crown, and were not obligated to pass to the next heirs to the Bourbon inheritance, the Bourbon-Montpensiers – the Duke and Duchess could bequeath them to whomsoever they wished. On 10 May 1491, the pair finally acquired an heir of their own, a daughter, Suzanne (Anne had an earlier pregnancy in 1476, but about this existed contradictory accounts: some say the baby was miscarried or been stillborn, but others reported that a living son was born, Charles, styled Count of Clermont in 1488 as was customary for the heir of the Duchy of Bourbon, who died aged 22 in 1498 and was buried in the Abbey of Souvigny, Auvergne).

By 1491, the Bourbon influence over the crown was waning; Charles VIII was an adult now, unwilling to accept tutelage from his family. Against the better judgement of Anne and Peter, Charles chose to renounce his unconsummated marriage to Margaret of Austria, and instead marry Anne, Duchess of Brittany; he then went against them by returning Margaret&#x27;s dowry – Artois and Franche-Comté – to her brother, Philip the Handsome. Nor were either able to prevent Charles&#x27; disastrous Italian expeditions, although both were left in control of France on several of his absences. Both continued to be major figures in the court for the rest of Charles VIII&#x27;s reign, but restricted in power. After Charles VIII&#x27;s death, and the accession of Louis XII, Peter largely retired from court politics and devoted his few remaining years to his family, being particularly devoted to his daughter Suzanne.

==Succession to the Duchy of Bourbon==
Without surviving male issue, the next heir to the Bourbon Duchy was Suzanne. It was in the question of the future of Suzanne and the Bourbon territories that Peter and Anne found themselves opposing each another in his final years. With Charles VIII dead and the more cautious Louis XII on the throne, Suzanne needed a husband to support her in her inheritance, which risked being disputed by the crown and the Montpensiers. The Duke and Duchess had initially groomed the next Bourbon heir, Louis of Bourbon-Montpensier, as a son-in-law; but he mortally offended Peter by condemning letters patent of Louis XII which confirmed Suzanne&#x27;s rights of inheritance (having been wrung from him as the price of Bourbon support upon his accession).

Peter then decided to betroth Suzanne to Charles IV, Duke of Alençon, a favourite of Louis XII, and so likely to protect the duchy against royal encroachment and Montpensier challenges. This contract was signed on 21 March 1501 at Moulins, Charles being 11, Suzanne 9. Before this marriage could be completed, however, Peter died of a fever. Following this, Anne arranged for Suzanne to marry the next Bourbon heir-male, Charles of Bourbon-Montpensier (Louis of Bourbon-Montpensier having died the year before), thereby averting a succession dispute over the Bourbon inheritance, which the young pair inherited jointly.

<text>Suzanne de Bourbon (10 May 1491 – 28 April 1521) was &quot;suo jure&quot; Duchess of Bourbon and Auvergne from 1503 to her death alongside her husband Charles III.

== Early life ==

Suzanne was born the second child and only daughter of Duke Peter II of Bourbon and Anne of France, herself the eldest daughter of Louis XI of France. From 1483 to 1491, Suzanne&#x27;s parents served as co-regents of France during the minority of Anne&#x27;s younger brother, Charles VIII of France. Furthermore, Anne&#x27;s younger sister (and Suzanne&#x27;s aunt), Joan, was (briefly) queen of France as wife of Louis XII of France, who succeeded Charles VIII in 1498.

==Succession==
Suzanne had an elder brother, Charles, who was born in 1476 and died unmarried in 1498. After this death at the age of 22, Suzanne&#x27;s father grew concerned about the succession of the Bourbon lands, having no surviving sons or brothers. Under Salic law, his heir presumptive was Louis de Bourbon-Montpensier, head of the Montpensiers, a cadet branch of the Bourbons. Montpensier was Suzanne&#x27;s second cousin, their grandfathers being brothers.

The year 1498 saw Anne&#x27;s brother King Charles VIII passed away unexpectedly, after hitting his head on a low doorway. As no male heirs remained, the succession of France itself was now in question, for the closest agnatic dynast, Louis XII, was a second-cousin once removed to Charles VIII (and to Anne). Having served as Charles&#x27; co-regents, the powerful couple held enough influence to hinder the succession of Louis XII. They made a clever bargain with him: for the Bourbon support of his accession, Louis XII would have to issue official letters recognizing the seven-year-old Suzanne as rightful heir to her father&#x27;s Bourbon lands. Louis had little choice but to agree to this novel proceeding, at least for the moment. The relatively novel Salic law which precluded the succession of females, became the cornerstone of French laws and customs. Indeed, that law allowed Louis, rather than Anne, to succeed to the throne of France. To Anne&#x27;s credit, when she handed over Bourbon lands to Louis XII, the last independent duchy in France was in good stead, being both prosperous and peaceful.

In 1503, Duke Peter died and Suzanne became duchess. Anne was regent during Suzanne&#x27;s minority and groomed the intelligent Suzanne with the thought of her daughter ascending to the throne. Her lessons included astronomy, mathematics, and religion. But more importantly, Anne taught her the ways of the court. Beyond the social graces, being kind, well-spoken, and sociable were also key. But the most important lesson she imparted to her daughter was never to react to anything told her and to keep her thoughts to herself, lest they somehow betray her. Anne knew only too well that the politics of the court were often underhanded, if not treacherous.

==Duchess==
As the agnatic heir to the Bourbon lands, Louis II, Count of Montpensier, was a suitable young man, and as marriage with him would avert a struggle for the succession (quite inevitable otherwise), Suzanne&#x27;s parents initially groomed him as their future son-in-law, despite the concession they had extracted from Louis XII regarding the succession. However, the teenage Montpensier mortally offended Peter by condemning and denouncing the letters patent concerning the succession which Louis XII had issued, and asserting that succession to the Bourbon lands and titles was his own patrimony and birthright and not something he needed to thank his wife or her father for.

An enraged Peter decided to betroth Suzanne to Charles IV, Duke of Alençon, a great favourite of Louis XII, and therefore likely to be able to protect the duchy against both Bourbon-Montpensier challenges and royal encroachment. Anne was not in favour of this arrangement because of the political complications it would certainly cause, since Bourbon-Montpensier would definitely pursue his dynastic claim. However, Peter prevailed and the contract of betrothal was signed on 21 March 1501 at Moulins, Alençon being eleven years old and Suzanne nine.

Two years later, and before the wedding could be solemnised, Peter died of a fever. Incidentally, Louis of Montpensier had also died before this, and had been succeeded by his younger brother Charles. With Peter and Louis both dead, the issues which had plagued their relationship could also be laid to rest. Anne broke off the arrangement with Alençon and arranged for Suzanne to marry the next Bourbon heir-male, Charles, thereby averting a succession dispute over the Bourbon inheritance. On 10 May 1505, at Château du Parc-les-Moulins, Suzanne was married to Charles. He was immediately made co-ruler of the Bourbon lands. After the wedding, the duke and duchess of Bourbon made a tour through their domains along with Anne, something they would repeat many times during their rule.

It does not appear that Suzanne participated in state affairs: her husband and her mother jointly managed the affairs of the duchies and were described as good partners in administration and politics. Duchess Suzanne reportedly had delicate health and was frequently described by chronicles as being of a &#x27;general disposition&#x27; and having a &#x27;deformity&#x27;, though her condition is not described more closely. A son was born to Charles and Suzanne on 17 July 1517 and was baptised Francis in October 1517 in honour of Charles&#x27; good friend King Francis I of France. The child was given the title Count of Clermont. However, he died after a few months. Suzanne later gave birth to stillborn (or short-lived) twins.

Suzanne died at Château de Châtellerault in 1521. She was buried in Souvigny Priory, Souvigny. Her health had been frail throughout her last years. Her mother, who had always been fearful about her daughter&#x27;s health, outlived her by one year. Her widower remained duke. He never remarried and died childless in 1527, after which the lands of the dukes of Bourbon were merged into the kingdom of France.

==Legacy==
The death of Suzanne and Charles marked respectively the extinctions of the two senior-most branches of the Bourbon family, namely Suzanne&#x27;s natal &quot;Bourbon&quot; branch and Charles&#x27;s &quot;Bourbon-Montpensier&quot; branch. The agnatic heir to both was their fifth cousin, Charles, Duke of Vendôme, head of the &quot;Bourbon-Vendome&quot; branch, which came to be called simply &quot;the House of Bourbon&quot; because it was now the senior-most branch. (The elder branches of the House of Bourbon were descended in the male line from Peter I, Duke of Bourbon whereas the Bourbon-Vendome branch was descended in the male line from Peter&#x27;s younger brother James I, Count of La Marche.) Indeed, the Bourbon-Vendome branch was destined also to inherit the throne of France: Charles, Duke of Vendôme was the grandfather of Henry IV of France, the first &quot;Bourbon&quot; king of France.

<text>Louis de Bourbon (1405 – May 1486) was the third son of John I, Duke of Bourbon and Marie, Duchess of Auvergne. He was Count of Montpensier, Clermont-en-Auvergne and Sancerre and Dauphin of Auvergne and was a younger brother of Charles I of Bourbon. He founded the Bourbon-Montpensier branch of the House of Bourbon, which would eventually take over the Duchy in 1505.

==Family==

In 1428, Louis married Joanna, Dauphine of Auvergne, daughter and heiress of Beraud III, Dauphin of Auvergne and Count of Clermont-en-Auvergne. After her death in 1436, he retained those titles (his paternal grandmother having been Anne of Auvergne, daughter of Dauphin Beraud II). On 5 February 1442, he married Gabrielle de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, daughter of Bertrand V of La Tour, count of Auvergne and Boulogne, and Jacquette of Peschin. The couple had four children:
* Gilbert, Count of Montpensier (1443–1496)
* John (1445–1485)
* Gabrielle de Bourbon (1447–1516), Countess of Benon, married in 1485 Louis de la Tremoille, Prince of Talmond
* Charlotte (1449–1478), married in 1468 Wolfert van Borselen, Count of Grandpré and Earl of Buchan

Louis was succeeded by his son Gilbert.

<text>Gilbert of Bourbon-Montpensier (1443 – 15 October 1496, Pozzuoli), Count of Montpensier, was a member of the House of Bourbon. He was the son of Louis I, Count of Montpensier and Gabrielle de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Count of Montpensier and Dauphin d&#x27;Auvergne. He was appointed to the Order of Saint Michael by King Charles VIII of France in October 1483.

==Life==
Gilbert was the first person, after a number of divisions of Auvergne in the Middle Ages, to carry the bloodlines of the respective dynasties of each of the three main divisions of Auvergne, the countship, the dukedom and the dauphinate.

His paternal grandmother Marie of Berry, Duchess of Bourbon, was heiress to the duchy of Auvergne. The creation for the Berry and Bourbon branches was made of lands that were confiscated from the count of Auvergne by Philip II of France. His paternal great-grandmother Anne of Auvergne was daughter of the Dauphin of Auvergne and after the extinction of her brother&#x27;s line, in her issue the heiress thereof. Though Gilbert was by no means the primogenitural heir to any of them, as head of the cadet branch of his family, he received Montpensier and the dauphinate as appanages inside the extended family.

===Marriage and issue===

On 24 February 1482 Gilbert married Clara Gonzaga (1 July 1464 – 2 June 1503), daughter of Federico I of Gonzaga of Mantua; they had the following issue:
*Louise, Duchess of Montpensier (1482 – 15 July 1561), eventually the heiress of all the Bourbon estates, but not titles
*Louis II, Count of Montpensier (1483 – 14 August 1501)
*Charles III, Duke of Bourbon (17 February 1490 – 6 May 1527, in battle), 
*François, Duke of Châtellerault (1492 – 13 September 1515, Battle of Marignano)
*Renée, Lady of Mercœur (1494 – 26 May 1539, Nancy), married on 26 June 1515 at the Château d&#x27;Amboise to Antoine, Duke of Lorraine
*Anne (1495 – 1510, Spain)
===Viceroy of Naples===
Gilbert was made the Viceroy of Naples in 1495 after king Charles VIII of France occupied the city in the Italian War of 1494–1495. In July 1496, Montpensier was captured at the Siege of Atella with the remaining French forces, he and his men were held in a malarial marshland near Pozzuoli, where he later died.

<text>Charles III, Duke of Bourbon (17 February 1490 – 6 May 1527) was a French military leader and noble. He was the count of Montpensier, Clermont-en-Auvergne, and dauphin of Auvergne from 1501 to 1525, and then duke of Bourbon and Auvergne, count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis, Forez and La Marche, and lord of Beaujeu from 1505 to 1521. He was also the constable of France from 1515 to 1521. Also known as the Constable of Bourbon, he was the last of the great feudal lords to openly oppose the king of France. Bourbon and Francis I of France finally fell out over disputes concerning inheritance. Bourbon commanded the troops of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in what became known as the Sack of Rome in 1527, where he was killed.

==Family==

Charles was born at Montpensier, the second son of Count Gilbert of Montpensier by his wife Clara Gonzaga (1 July 1464 – 2 June 1503). Gilbert died in 1496, and his elder son, Louis II, died unwed in 1501, leaving Charles the heir to the family&#x27;s titles and extensive lands in Auvergne.

==Marriage==
Charles married his agnatic second cousin, Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon. It was a dynastic match, intended to settle the question of succession to the Bourbon estates, which had arisen because Suzanne&#x27;s father, Duke Peter II of Bourbon, the last of the senior Bourbon line, had died without sons. Charles was the scion of the next-senior Bourbon line, and thus the heir male of the House of Bourbon, while Suzanne was the heir general. With the marriage, Charles&#x27;s position as Duke of Bourbon became undisputed. This cementing of position was important for another reason: with the death of Charles IV, Duke of Alençon, in 1525, Charles became the next in line (prince of the blood) to the French throne after the three sons of French King Francis I.

==Career==

Already distinguished as a soldier in the Italian Wars, Charles was appointed constable of France by Francis I of France in 1515, and was rewarded for his services at the Battle of Marignano (where he commanded the vanguard) with the Governorship of Milan. However, Francis was uneasy with the proud and wealthy duke, and soon recalled him from Milan and refused to honor his debts. Charles was further angered by the appointment of Charles IV of Alençon, Francis&#x27;s brother-in-law, as commander of the vanguard during the campaigns in the Netherlands, an office which should have been his.

The death of his wife in 1521 provoked the final breach between Charles and Francis. Suzanne had left all her estates to Charles, but the king&#x27;s mother, Louise of Savoy, claimed them as the heir in proximity in blood due to their previous entailments. She proposed to settle the question by marrying Charles; he refused the proposal because Louise was over forty-five years of age and fourteen years older than him. On behalf of his mother, Francis confiscated a portion of the Bourbon estates before the lawsuit had even been opened. Seeing no hope of prevailing, Charles made a secret agreement to betray his king and offer his services to Emperor Charles V. The emperor, the constable, and King Henry VIII of England devised a grand plan to partition France. This however came to nothing because the plot was discovered; Charles was stripped of his offices and proclaimed a traitor. He fled into Italy in 1523 and entered the imperial service.

In 1524, he drove the French under Bonnivet from Lombardy, and fought at the Battle of Pavia. The emperor gave Charles command of a mixed Spanish–German army (which included a number of Lutherans) sent to chastise Pope Clement VII. He neglected to supply this army with money or food, and Charles was only able to keep it together by promises of loot. Though Clement arranged a truce with the emperor, the army continued its advance, reaching Rome in May 1527. The death of Charles—the artist and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini claimed that he fired the shot that killed him—outside the walls removed the last restraints from the army, which resulted in the sack of Rome.

==Progeny and succession==
By Suzanne, Charles was the father of twins and of Francis of Bourbon, Count of Clermont. Officially, since neither survived a year of age, the senior line of the dukes of Bourbon was extinct in male line with his death in battle, and the junior line (dukes of Vendôme) were not allowed to inherit, because Charles had forfeited his fiefs by committing treason. However, the county of Montpensier and dauphinate of Auvergne (but not the duchy of Bourbon) were later returned to his sister Louise, who was married to Louis, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon, a member of the more junior House of Bourbon-Vendome. The Dukes of Montpensier line continued after Louise&#x27;s death through her descendants.

<text>Swordsmanship or sword fighting refers to the skills and techniques used in combat and training with any type of sword. The term is modern, and as such was mainly used to refer to smallsword fencing, but by extension it can also be applied to any martial art involving the use of a sword. The formation of the English word &quot;swordsman&quot; is parallel to the Latin word &quot;gladiator&quot;, a term for the professional fighters who fought against each other and a variety of other foes for the entertainment of spectators in the Roman Empire. The word &quot;gladiator&quot; itself comes from the Latin word &quot;gladius&quot;, which is a type of sword.

==Europe==
===Classical history===

The Roman legionaries and other forces of the Roman military, until the 2nd century A.D., used the gladius as a short thrusting sword effectively with the &quot;scutum&quot;, a type of shield, in battle. According to Vegetius, the Romans mainly used underhanded stabs and thrusts, because one thrust into the gut would kill an enemy faster than slashes or cutting. However, some depictions of Roman soldiers show them using slashing and cuts. Gladiators used a shorter gladius than the military. The spatha was a longer double-edged sword initially used only by Celtic soldiers, later incorporated as auxilia into Roman Cavalry units; however by the 2nd century A.D. the spatha was used throughout much of the Roman Empire. 

The Empire&#x27;s legionary soldiers were heavily trained and prided themselves on their disciplinary skills. This probably carried over to their training with weaponry, no Roman manuals of swordsmanship have survived. One translation of Juvenal&#x27;s poetry by Barten Holyday in 1661 makes note that the Roman trainees learned to fight with the wooden wasters before moving on to the use of sharpened steel. In fact, it is also found that Roman gladiators trained with a wooden sword, which was weighted with lead, against a straw man or a wooden pole known as a &quot;palus&quot; (an early relative of the later wooden &quot;pell&quot;). This training would have provided the Roman soldier with a good foundation of skill, to be improved upon from practical experience or further advanced training.

===Post-classical history===
Little is known about early medieval fencing techniques save for what may be concluded from archaeological evidence and artistic depiction (see Viking Age arms and armour). What little has been found, however, shows the use of the sword was limited during the Viking age, especially among the Vikings themselves and other northern Germanic tribes. Here, the spear, axe, and shield were prominent weapons, with only wealthy individuals owning swords. These weapons, based on the early Germanic &quot;spatha&quot;, were made very well. The technique of pattern welding of composite metals, invented in the Roman Empire around the end of the 2nd century A.D., provided some of these northern weapons superior properties in strength and resilience to the iron gladius of early Rome.

As time passed, the &quot;spatha&quot; evolved into the arming sword, a weapon with a notable cruciform hilt common among knights in the Medieval Age. Some time after this evolution, the earliest known treatises &quot;(Fechtbücher&quot;) were written, dealing primarily with arming sword and buckler combat. Among these examples is the I.33, the earliest known &quot;Fechtbuch&quot;. The German school of swordsmanship can trace itself most closely to Johannes Liechtenauer and his students, who later became the German masters of the 15th century, including Sigmund Ringeck, Hans Talhoffer, Peter von Danzig and Paulus Kal. It is possible that the Italian fencing treatise Flos Duellatorum, written by the Italian swordmaster Fiore dei Liberi around 1410, has ties to the German school. During this period of time, the longsword grew out of the arming sword, eventually resulting in a blade comfortably wielded in both hands at once. Armour technology also evolved, leading to the advent of plate armour, and thus swordsmanship was further pressed to meet the demands of killing a very well protected enemy.

For much of the early medieval period, the sword continued to remain a symbol of status. During later years, production techniques became more efficient, and so, while the sword remained a privilege, it was not so heavily confined to only the richest individuals, but rather to the richest classes.

===Modern history===
The military importance of swordsmanship rapidly diminished in the 16th century with the advent of firearms. The last prominent battlefield sword to be used was the backsword. Although it was not a new invention, it managed to outlast other forms of war swords, being used by cavalry units and officers.

The power, accuracy, and reliability of firearms continued to improve, however, and soon swords had little place on the battlefield aside from ceremonial purposes. The preferred civilian dueling weapon shifted from the rapier to the faster but shorter smallsword, and eventually shifted totally away from swords to the pistol, following developments in firearm technology. The civilian affair of dueling was banned in most areas, but persisted to some degree regardless of law, until well into the 20th century.

====Renaissance====

The German school of swordsmanship, in general, faced a decline during the Renaissance as the Italian and Spanish schools, which tilted more toward the rapier and civilian dueling, took the forefront. The compendium compiled by Paulus Hector Mair in the 1540s looks back to the preceding century of work and attempts to reconstruct and preserve a failing art. The treatise by Joachim Meyer, dating to the 1570s and notable for its scientific and complete approach to the style (it is suggested that Meyer&#x27;s students came to him with less military knowledge and therefore required more basic instruction), is the last major account of the German school, and its context is now almost entirely sportive.

The use of the longsword continued to decline throughout the Renaissance period, marked by the increased effectiveness of the arquebus and the use of pike squares as a powerful implement of battle. During this time, civilian swords evolved to side-swords, also known as &quot;cut and thrust&quot; swords, and progressed towards the thicker, tapering sword that eventually became the 17th century rapier. This new weapon was popular for both protection on the street and as a tool in the duel, but found little success on the battlefield. The Italian, French, and Spanish schools embraced this change in civilian armament and developed systems of rapier fencing. The German school, however, provides little on this weapon and ceases its prevalence thereafter.

====Development into a sport====
The need to train swordsmen for combat in a nonlethal manner led fencing and swordsmanship to include a sport aspect from its beginnings, from before the medieval tournament right up to the modern age.

The shift towards fencing as a sport rather than as military training happened from the mid-18th century, and was led by Domenico Angelo, who established a fencing academy, Angelo&#x27;s School of Arms, in Carlisle House, Soho, London in 1763. There, he taught the aristocracy the fashionable art of swordsmanship which they had previously had to go the continent to learn, and also set up a riding school in the former rear garden of the house. He was fencing instructor to the Royal Family. With the help of artist Gwyn Delin, he had an instruction book published in England in 1763, which had 25 engraved plates demonstrating classic positions from the old schools of fencing. His school was run by three generations of his family and dominated the art of European fencing for almost a century.
He established the essential rules of posture and footwork that still govern modern sport fencing, although his attacking and parrying methods were still much different from current practice. Although he intended to prepare his students for real combat, he was the first fencing master yet to emphasize the health and sporting benefits of fencing more than its use as a killing art, particularly in his influential book &#x27;L&#x27;École des armes&quot; (&quot;The School of Fencing&quot;), published in 1763. According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;Angelo was the first to emphasize fencing as a means of developing health, poise, and grace. As a result of his insight and influence, fencing changed from an art of war to a sport.&quot;

As fencing progressed, the combat aspect slowly faded until only the rules of the sport remained. While fencing taught in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was intended to serve both for competition and the duel (while understanding the differences between the two situations), the type of fencing taught in a modern sport fencing salle is intended only to train the student to compete in the most effective manner within the rules of the sport.

As this evolution has continued, the training and techniques have become increasingly further removed from their martial roots. One driving force behind this evolution is sport fencing&#x27;s award of a point to the fencer who scores the first touch with right of way; this encourages the competitors to use scoring techniques that result in a first touch in a sporting encounter but would leave them defenseless against a counterthrust, even from a mortally wounded opponent, in a duel with lethal weapons. The development of the first touch rule itself was, in turn, driven by the increasing tendency of duels to be fought to draw first blood, rather than the death, with the result that training for a first touch could result in victory in a duel as well as a sporting encounter, even without killing or disabling the opponent.

=====Historical fencing=====
As early as 1880, attempts were made to recreate the older German, Italian, and Spanish schools of swordsmanship. The movement was led in England by the soldier, writer, antiquarian, and swordsman, Alfred Hutton. In 1862, he organized in his regiment stationed in India the Cameron Fencing Club, for which he prepared his first work, a 12-page booklet entitled &quot;Swordsmanship&quot;.

After returning from India in 1865, Hutton focused on the study and revival of older fencing systems and schools. He began tutoring groups of students in the art of &#x27;ancient swordplay&#x27; at a club attached to the London Rifle Brigade School of Arms in the 1880s. In 1889, Hutton published his most influential work &quot;Cold Steel: A Practical Treatise on the Sabre&quot;, which presented the historical method of military sabre use on foot, combining the 18th century English backsword with modern Italian duelling sabre.

Hutton&#x27;s pioneering advocacy and practice of historical fencing included reconstructions of the fencing systems of several historical masters including George Silver and Achille Marozzo. He delivered numerous practical demonstrations with his colleague Egerton Castle of these systems during the 1890s, both in order to benefit various military charities and to encourage patronage of the contemporary methods of competitive fencing. Exhibitions were held at the Bath Club and a fund-raising event was arranged at Guy&#x27;s Hospital.

Despite this revival, the practice died out soon after the death of Hutton in 1910. Interest in the physical application of historical fencing techniques remained largely dormant during the first half of the 20th century, and only revived near the end of the 20th century.

===== Classical fencing =====

Practitioners of modern fencing, who were unsatisfied with the exclusive sports emphasis that modern fencing had, took steps to preserve the principles of dueling and fencing as practiced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Classical fencing uses the foil, épée, and sabre according to these older practices.

Fencing and sword fighting have been incorporated into films as part of cinematic action sequences. Usually choreographed, these scenes are designed for entertainment but often demonstrate a high level of skill. Actor Errol Flynn became known for his sword-fighting scenes, such as in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938). Other examples include &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1995), and &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002).

==Africa==
===North Africa===
The sword in ancient Egypt was known by several names, but most are variations of the words , or . The earliest bronze swords in the country date back 4000 years. Four types of sword are known to have been used: the &quot;ma&quot; or boomerang-sword based on the hunting stick, the &quot;kat&quot; or knife-sword, the or falchion based on the sickle, and a fourth form of straight longsword. The was used region-wide and is depicted as early as the Sixth Dynasty (3000 BC). It was thick-backed and weighted with bronze, sometimes even with gold hilts in the case of pharaohs. The blade may be edged on one or both sides, and was made from copper alloy, bronze, iron, or blue steel. The double-edge grip-tongue sword is believed to have been introduced by the Sherden and became widely dispersed throughout the Near East. These swords are of various lengths, and were paired with shields. They had a leaf-shaped blade, and a handle which hollows away at the centre and thickens at each end. Middle Eastern swords became dominant throughout North Africa after the introduction of Islam, after which point swordsmanship in the region becomes that of Arabian or Middle Eastern fencing.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
Among some communities, swords were restricted to royalty or tribal leaders. Forms vary from one area to another, such as the billao of Somalia, boomerang-sword in Niger or the single-edge swords of the Gold Coast. The Abyssinian shotel took the form of a large sickle, like the Egyptian khopesh, with a small wooden handle. The edge was on the inside of the blade, which has a mid-rib running along its entire length. Double-edge swords similar to those of Europe and ancient Arabia occurred in some areas such as the takoba and kaskara. Two types of sword existed in Zanzibar: the shortsword and the standard sword with a blade measuring had a cylindrical pommel. The latter weapon was wielded with both hands like a quarterstaff.

==Asia==
===East Asia===
====Chinese====

Chinese speakers make a clear distinction between a &quot;sword&quot; (double-edged) and a &quot;knife&quot; (single-edged). In Chinese culture the double-edged sword or jian is considered a master&#x27;s weapon or gentlemen&#x27;s weapon, both from the considerable skill required to fight with this weapon and from the fact that commanders of armies favored the jian in order to move easily amongst the troops. It is described in Chinese as the &quot;delicate lady&quot; of weapons, and is traditionally considered the weapon most suitable for women. A single edged sword is referred to as a dao. The jian and dao are among the four main weapons taught in the Chinese system, the others being the staff and spear. The order in which these weapons is taught may vary between schools and styles, but the jian is generally taught last among the four.

====Japanese====

The sword has long held a significance in Japanese culture from the reverence and care that the samurai placed in their weapons. The earliest swords in Japan were straight, based on early Chinese &quot;jian&quot;. Curved blades became more common at the end of the 8th century, with the importation of the curved forging techniques of that time. The shape was more efficient when fighting from horseback. Japanese swordsmanship is primarily two-handed wherein the front hand pushes down and the back hand pulls up while delivering a basic vertical cut. The samurai often carried two swords, the longer &quot;katana&quot; and the shorter &quot;wakizashi&quot;, and these were normally wielded individually, though use of both as a pair did occur.

While earlier &quot;tachi&quot; were primarily intended to be used from horseback and were thus worn with the edge facing down, the later &quot;katana&quot; was worn with the edge facing upwards; this simple alteration allowed the wielder to transition immediately from a draw directly into an attack without needing to first re-orient their weapon or body, proving to be a more efficient and practical optimization tailored toward melee combat scenarios (which were becoming more common than mounted combat at that time). Entire systems have been based on this technique and are known as iaido, iaijutsu, battodo, or battojutsu. Because of the danger in training with real swords, practitioners since the 18th century have trained with wooden swords (&quot;bokken&quot; or &quot;bokutō&quot;) or bamboo swords (&quot;shinai&quot;) while wearing body armour. After the carrying of swords in public became illegal, this resulted in the modern sport of kendo. Some ancient schools still exist along with some more modern schools. Many schools also focus almost exclusively on swordsmanship which grew from the noble families&#x27; patronage of certain teachers.

====Korean====
The earliest Korean swords were straight double-edge blades derived from the Chinese jian. As Korean warfare favoured mounted combat, the curved single-edge sword was found to be more effective from horseback. Joseon&#x27;s centralized government and the need to fend off frequent foreign invasions were conducive to the development of swordsmanship as a standardized military discipline. Along with other martial systems, forms of swordsmanship were formalised in the military manual &quot;Muyejebo&quot; (1610) based on Qi Jiguang&#x27;s &quot;Ji Xiao Xin Shu&quot;, and in the revisions, &quot;Muyesinbo&quot; (1759) and &quot;Muyedobotongji&quot; (1790). The Muyedobotongji also describes standard lengths and weights of the swords used; while not exclusive to swordsmanship, 8 of the 23 chapters are devoted to it, reflecting the needs of the era when guns had not yet matured enough for short-range combat.

===Southeast Asia===
====Filipino====
Swords in the Philippines come in a variety of forms but are traditionally consistent with the straight or lightly curved cutting type used by the tribes of neighbouring Borneo and Taiwan. This is preserved in the design of the kampilan and the dahong palay, though other forms also existed. They were typically paired with a rectangular shield called the kalasag. During the Battle of Mactan, Lapu-Lapu&#x27;s tribe used native swords and spears to defeat Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s troops who were armed with guns and cannons.

The arrival of European colonists brought the influence of western swords, which is likely the origin of the pinuti&#x27;s hand-guard and sabre-like blade. When the Philippines was colonized by the Spaniards, the use of traditional swords and weapons was immediately banned. Because of this, the Filipinos were forced to use their own farm tools to fight in rebellions. And in the following insurgencies against other foreign colonists like America and Japan, they were again forced to use these improvised weapons. During the Japanese occupation, because of scarce ammunition to fight the Japanese, the Filipinos used guerrilla attacks with their melee weapons and swords in raiding Japanese camps. Filipino swordplay relies heavily on speed, and even today Filipino marines train in a form of eskrima using a curved single-edge sword.

===South Asia===
====Indian====
Soldiers in ancient Indian subcontinent are recorded as carrying a shield and spear in their hands while a sword, dagger, and battle-axe were held at the waist. These included both straight swords and slightly curved sabres. The stout, straight sword appears to have been common and can be seen in early sculptural depictions of the epics. The hero Arjuna, for instance, is made to wield a one-handed sword with a bevelled point, a small handguard, and a large round pommel. Two-handed swords naturally had longer handles and were broad at the hilt. Curved swords are also known to have been in common use since at least the Buddhist era, including large kukri-like falchions. The most common type of curved sword is the &quot;katti&quot;, which still occurs under various names everywhere from the deep south to the far northeast. The handle, in particular, has changed over time, eventually incorporating a crossguard. The 16th-century Mughal conquests spread the talwar and similar weapons throughout the north, northwest and central regions. The talwar is still the most common form of sword in the martial arts of these areas, but the older &quot;katti&quot; is still used in some advanced forms.

The earliest extant manual on ancient Indian swordsmanship is the &quot;Agni Purana&quot;, which gives 32 positions to be taken with the sword and shield. Indian swordplay is highly athletic, taking advantage of the weapon&#x27;s lightweight. Techniques make extensive use of circular movements, often circling the weapon around the swordsman&#x27;s head. Systems exist which focus on drawing the sword out of the opponent&#x27;s body. The attacking weapon is rarely used for blocking, relying either on a shield as a parrying tool or a second sword. Dual-wielding is thus a common and valued skill in the Indian subcontinent. Sparring is done through an exercise called gatka, in which the practitioners fight with wooden sticks to simulate swords.

==Middle East==
===Persian and Hebrew===
Swords in the Middle East evolved from daggers and sickles. They were originally made of copper, followed by bronze and finally iron. Among communities such as the Persians and Hebrews, the sword was short and equivalent to the Roman gladius. There did however exist longswords, slightly curved swords, and sickle-like swords similar to the Egyptian khopesh. Some blades were of such varying sizes that it is difficult to classify them as either daggers or swords, and they are thus referred to by archaeologists as dagger-swords.In modern Iran, traditional Persian armed combat called &quot;razmafzar&quot; is currently being reconstructed. At present, sword training includes the single sword, two swords, and the sword with a shield.

===Assyrian and Hittite===
Among the Assyrians and Hittites, the sword or &quot;namsaru&quot; was long with a slender blade. In the ancient Middle East, swords were always a secondary weapon. Assyrians made extensive use of the sword and dagger in hand-to-hand combat; the primary weapons were the bow, spear, and sling.

===Arabia and the Levant===
Prior to the founding of Islam, swords were imported from Ubulla, a town along the Tigris river in Iraq.

Arabian swords retained their straight double-edge shape during the time of Muhammed. With the exception of their curved handles, they were nearly identical to medieval European arming swords in both function and design. They typically had a cruciform hilt and favoured cut and thrust techniques. Swords of this type were often paired with a shield or buckler but could also be wielded on their own.

Sword fencing and sword dances are still practiced in much of the Middle East. In countries like Oman the weapon is typically paired with a shield or sometimes a dagger, of which many varieties exist. 
The spread of Islam was a unifying force in the Middle East, easing trade routes across the region. Armouries flourished and Damascus became the capital for trade in swords from Syria, Persia and Spain. The 9th-century Muslim scholar Al-Kindi studied the craft of forging swords and found 25 sword-making techniques particular to their countries of origin, including Yemen, Iran, France, and Russia.

===Turkey===
The curved scimitar blade which has now come to typify Middle Eastern swords came about after the Turkish Seljuk migration from Central Asia to Anatolia, popularizing the pre-existing Byzantine sabre designs for cavalry use, which influenced the entire region. The curved blade was well-suited to the equestrian culture of the Turks. The scimitar gave primacy to hacking and slashing techniques rather than thrusting.

<text>The West Clare Railway (WCR) originally operated in County Clare, Ireland, between 1887 and 1961. This narrow-gauge railway ran from the county town of Ennis, via numerous stopping-points along the West Clare coast to two termini, at Kilrush and Kilkee, with the routes diverging at Moyasta Junction. The system was the last operating narrow gauge passenger system in Ireland and connected with the mainline rail system at Ennis, where a station still stands today for bus and train services to Limerick and Galway. Intermediate stops included Ennistymon, Lahinch and Milltown Malbay.

A preservation society maintains a railway museum at Moyasta Junction station, and successfully re-opened a section of the railway as a passenger-carrying heritage line with diesel traction in the 1990s, and with steam motive power from 2009.

The Railway was notorious for poor timekeeping, resulting in litigation and a celebrated comic song.

==Construction==
After the Great Famine ended there was a new growth in local businesses, and the British Government determined that an improved railway system was necessary to aid the recovery of the West of Ireland. The West Clare Railway and the South Clare Railway were built by separate companies, but in practice, the West Clare Railway operated the entire line. The lines met at Milltown Malbay. In due course, the entire line became known as the West Clare Railway.

===West Clare Railway===
The West Clare Railway between Ennis and Milltown Malbay was built a few years earlier than the South Clare Railway. The first sod was cut on 26 January 1885 at Milltown Malbay by Charles Stewart Parnell, M.P., although actual work on the line had begun in November 1884.

In late February 1887, the Athenry and Ennis Railway (A&amp;E) filed an injunction to prevent the West Clare Railway from accessing lands it had built on that the A&amp;E had previously claimed but not yet constructed on for itself. The case went to arbitration in March 1887. The West Clare Railway initially agreed to pay £51 annually for the right to build on the land, then in a second agreement reached on 27 June 1888, the West Clare Railway was ordered to pay rent at £60 annually to the A&amp;E (which later became part of the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway) for use of the land.

The line was opened on 2 July 1887. The notes for construction of the line were closed in December 1887.

===South Clare Railway===
The South Clare Railway built the extension from Milltown Malbay to Kilrush, Cappagh Pier (Kilrush Pier) and Kilrush docks with a branch to Kilkee from Moyasta. The line was proposed in 1889, with work starting on the extension in October 1890 and opening on 11 May 1892. The extension was worked by the West Clare Railway and was initially dogged by poor service and time keeping, but this later improved. Some of the service irregularity was attributed, in a report given at the railway&#x27;s annual meeting in 1894, to a requirement set by the Board of Trade to run separate passenger and goods trains rather than mixed trains.

==Operation and timekeeping==
The West Clare Railway was the topic of Percy French&#x27;s song &quot;Are Ye Right There Michael, are ye right?&quot; (written in 1902), deriding the poor timekeeping and poor track quality of the time. Though amusing, some complained that this jesting nevertheless did little to further the cause for keeping the line open. French wrote the song after successfully suing the railway company for loss of earnings, when a late-running train prevented him from attending a performance on time. The company, in turn, appealed the ruling, but French was over an hour late for the court hearing in Ennis. He informed the judge that his lateness was because &quot;I took the West Clare Railway here, your honour&quot;. The railway company&#x27;s appeal was unsuccessful.

Many myths have arisen concerning the Percy French incident. The facts are that French had arrived in Kilkee four-and-a-half hours after the scheduled time for a show he was due to give at Moore&#x27;s Hall on 10 August 1896. He had been due there at 3:25 pm, having begun his journey at Broadstone Terminus in Dublin that morning. The show was late starting as a result, and with a much-reduced audience. French won his case at the Ennis Quarter Sessions in January 1897, and was awarded £10 plus expenses. The Clare Journal&#x27;s headline for the court hearing was, &#x27;An Hour With Percy French &quot;free of charge&quot;&#x27;. The case has since been re-enacted by the Corofin Dramatic Society at Ennis Courthouse. His award was subsequently upheld in a reserved judgment when the railway company appealed the case two months later at the Clare Spring Assizes, before the Rt. Hon. Chief Baron Christopher Palles, by which time French had the germ of a song in his head: the line, &#x27;If you want to get to Kilkee, you must go there by the sea&#x27; was repeated in court although it failed to make it in the song&#x27;s final version. The Railway had a disastrous policy of defending litigation. In another case heard on the same day as the Percy French case, Mrs. Mary Ann Butler, from Limerick sued the Railway successfully when she was struck by a donkey on the Railway platform in Ennis.

==Amalgamation and nationalisation==
In 1925, the company was merged into the Great Southern Railways. In 1945 the GSR was taken over by Córas Iompair Éireann. In the same year, a survey of local businesses was conducted with a view to the possible replacement of the railway by road services. CIE was nationalised in 1950. Local campaigners urged that the railway be converted to the standard Irish gauge of , but CIÉ rejected this on cost grounds.

==Steam locomotives==
The West Clare Railway operated a fleet of eighteen steam locomotives. Some historical confusion is caused by the reusing of fleet numbers (when locomotives were withdrawn, their numbers were reallocated). Each entry in the table below is a separate locomotive, even where fleet numbers are repeated.

==Diesel locomotives and units==

In the early 1950s, under CIÉ management, the West Clare Railway became a pioneer in the use of diesel traction. Passenger services were largely operated by four new articulated diesel railcars, built by Walker Brothers of Wigan, England (almost identical to units built for the County Donegal Railways). These were followed by three diesel locomotives (also built by Walkers). The use of diesel traction reduced operating costs, yet the investment in new rolling stock would largely be wasted by the early closure of the line.

==Closure==
Despite the dieselisation of passenger services in 1952 and freight in 1953 the system was still closed. On 27 September 1960, CIÉ gave notice of its intending closure with effect from 1 February 1961. CIÉ said that the West Clare was losing £23,000 (€1.2M 2006 equivalent) per year, despite the considerable traffic handled. In December it was announced that the line would close completely on 1 January 1961. Eventually, the line closed on 31 January 1961 with CIÉ starting work on dismantling the line the day after the closure on 1 February 1961.

By the time of its closure, the West Clare Railway was the last narrow-gauge railway in Ireland offering a passenger service; various lines operated by Bord na Móna continue to operate in connection with the peat industry.

==Preservation and re-opening==

Starting in the mid-1990s, efforts were made by a preservation society to recreate part of the original route. This group succeeded in acquiring Moyasta station, and of the track bed. Passenger services were resumed using two new steel coaches with bench seating, parallel to the direction of travel, built by Alan Keef Engineering and outfitted locally in wood by WCR engineers. A small but powerful diesel locomotive built for Channel Tunnel construction work hauled the trains.

On 5 July 2009 the West Clare Railway&#x27;s original steam locomotive No 5 &quot;Slieve Callan&quot; was returned to the West Clare Railway at Moyasta Junction following restoration in England by Alan Keef Engineering Ltd of Ross-on-Wye. This engine had previously been a static exhibit at the mainline railway station in Ennis. The locomotive was steamed for the first time on 14 July marking the return of steam to the West Clare Railway after an absence of over 57 years.

The railway has since acquired a number of redundant diesel locomotives, mostly from the Irish Bord na Móna; these are being gradually restored and returned to service.

===Current rolling stock===
In addition to the steam locomotive &quot;Slieve Callan&quot;, the railway owns twelve diesel engines, of which two are currently in service, the others awaiting restoration. Those in service are a 4-wheel Channel Tunnel shunting engine and a four-wheel former Bord na Móna shunter. Awaiting restoration are a further nine such Bord na Móna shunters, plus a six-wheel mine shunting engine dating from around 1948.

Two passenger coaches are in service, and assorted maintenance vehicles including a tank wagon, four flat trucks, and four tipper wagons.

====Irish standard gauge vehicles====

In 2008, an Irish standard gauge ex-Irish Rail 001 class diesel loco, No.015 (formerly A15) and 201 class, that being C227, were acquired for static display.

There are also three standard gauge passenger coaches on-site as static exhibits. One of these is used as a reception centre and cafeteria for visitors, and another as a lecture theatre for group visits.

The gauge coaching stock located here consists of:
*Great Southern Railways Side Corridor carriage No.1325.
*Iarnród Éireann Mark 2AB carriages Nos.4108, 4110 and 4402 (restaurant).

A collection of mainline diesel locomotives owned by the Irish Traction Group has subsequently been located to the preserved railway (during 2009 and 2010) for storage, or as static exhibits. These locomotives include:
*121 class locomotive No. 124
*141 class locomotive No. 152
*181 class locomotive No. 190
*001 class locomotive No. A3R

=== Closure ===
The heritage railway has been closed since June 1st 2022 until further notice. The museum may reopen in 2024.

<doc id="703451" wikidata="Q506694" url="?curid=703451" title="Steve Chabot">
<text>Steven Joseph Chabot ( ; born January 22, 1953) is an American politician and lawyer who represented in the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2009 and again from 2011 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, he lost his 2022 reelection bid to Democrat Greg Landsman. Until his election loss, he was the dean of Ohio&#x27;s GOP delegation to the House of Representatives, after the retirement of former Speaker John Boehner.

==Early life, education, and pre-political career==
Chabot was born in 1953 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Gerard Joseph and Doris Leona (née Tilley) Chabot; paternally, he is of French-Canadian descent. He graduated from La Salle High School in Cincinnati in 1971, and then from the College of William and Mary in 1975, earning a Bachelor of Arts in physical education. He went on to obtain a Juris Doctor degree from Northern Kentucky University Salmon P. Chase College of Law in 1978. He worked as an elementary school teacher in 1975–1976 while taking law classes at night. Chabot also taught political science at the University of Cincinnati and chaired the Boy Scouts of Cincinnati.

As a practicing attorney from 1978 to 1994, Chabot handled domestic disputes and the drafting of wills as a sole practitioner. He operated out of a small law office in Westwood.

==Early political career==
Chabot ran unsuccessfully for the Cincinnati City Council as an independent candidate in 1979 and as a Republican in 1983. He won a seat in 1985 as a Republican and was reelected for the next four years. In 1988, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives against seven-term incumbent Democrat Tom Luken, who defeated him, 56–44%. In 1990 he was appointed a Commissioner of Hamilton County, Ohio, and was elected later that year and again in 1992, holding that office until 1994.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1994, Chabot ran for the U.S. House again and defeated Democratic incumbent David S. Mann of Ohio&#x27;s 1st congressional district, 56%–44%. In 1996, he defeated Democrat Mark Longabaugh, a member of the Cincinnati City Council, 54%–43%. In 1998, he defeated Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls, 53% to 47%. In the series of debates during that campaign, Qualls criticized Chabot for not funneling enough federal spending to his home district. Chabot countered that he would not support &quot;wasteful or unnecessary&quot; federal programs. In 2000, he defeated City Councilman John Cranley 53–44%. In 2002, he defeated Greg Harris with 65% of the vote. In 2004, he defeated Harris again, with 60% of the vote.

==== 2006 ====
Chabot defeated Democratic challenger John Cranley again, this time by a narrower margin of 52–48%.

==== 2008 ====

Chabot lost to State Representative Steve Driehaus, 52%–48%.

==== 2010 ====

In a rematch, Chabot defeated Driehaus, Libertarian Jim Berns, and Green Party nominee Richard Stevenson. Chabot won with 52% of the vote.

==== 2012 ====

Chabot defeated Democratic nominee Jeff Sinnard, 58%–38%, with Green nominee Rich Stevenson and Libertarian nominee Jim Berns picking up the balance. He was helped by the 2010 round of redistricting, which shifted the majority of heavily Republican Warren County to the 1st Congressional District.

==== 2014 ====

Chabot defeated Democratic nominee Fred Kundrata, 63%–37%.

==== 2016 ====

Chabot defeated Democratic nominee Michele Young, 59%–41%.

==== 2018 ====

Chabot defeated Democratic nominee Aftab Pureval, 51%–48%. Libertarian nominee Dirk Kubala took the remainder of the vote.

==== 2020 ====

Chabot defeated Democratic nominee Kate Schroder, 52%–45%. Libertarian nominee Kevin David Kahn took the remainder of the vote.

==== 2022 ====

Chabot&#x27;s district became considerably more Democratic in redistricting. It now includes the entire city of Cincinnati; previously the eastern portion had been in the heavily Republican 2nd district. Chabot had considered retiring but ultimately ran for re-election as he believed Republicans would write off the seat unless he ran again. In the general election, he lost in an upset to Democratic nominee Greg Landsman, a member of the Cincinnati City Council. Chabot was the last surviving member of the &quot;Republican Revolution&quot; of 1994 who was still serving in Congress. Afterwards, Chabot stated that he would not run for the seat in 2024.

===Tenure===


In 1999, Chabot served as one of the House managers in the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton.

On December 18, 2019, Chabot voted against both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Of the 195 Republicans who voted, 185 voted against both articles and 10 Republicans voted for impeachment.

On January 7, 2021, Chabot objected to the certification of the 2020 US presidential election results in Congress based on false claims of voter fraud.

In March 2021, he voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

In August 2021, &quot;Business Insider&quot; reported that Chabot had violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012, a federal transparency and conflict-of-interest law, by failing to properly disclose an exchange of stock in Allergan plc and AbbVie Inc. worth up to $30,000.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Foreign Affairs
**Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific
** Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia
* Committee on the Judiciary

==Political positions==

During the presidency of Donald Trump, Chabot voted in line with Trump&#x27;s stated position 93.1% of the time. As of August 2022, Chabot had voted in line with Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 16.4% of the time.

===Health care===
Chabot authored a bill prohibiting a form of late-term abortion called partial-birth abortion, referred to in some medical literature by its less common name of intact dilation and extraction. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on November 5, 2003.

Chabot favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He favors market-based reforms that he claims will offer American families more lower-cost options. He supported the March 2017 version of the American Health Care Act, the GOP&#x27;s replacement for Obamacare. On May 4, 2017, Chabot voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass the American Health Care Act.

===Environment===
On the topic of man-made climate change, Chabot has said, &quot;the evidence concerning man-made climate change is far from conclusive&quot;. He has said cap-and-trade is an &quot;extreme proposal&quot; that would harm the economy.

===Other===
In 1999, Chabot was one of the managers appointed to conduct the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton.

On August 22, 2011, Chabot asked Cincinnati police to confiscate cameras being used by private citizens to record a town-hall meeting, even as media television cameras recorded the incident. YouTube videos of the incident provided wide awareness of it, and the participating police officer was later disciplined.

In 2002, Chabot advocated teaching intelligent design alongside the theory of evolution by natural selection in Ohio high schools.

Chabot has called for ending logging subsidies in the Tongass National Forest, and promoted relations with Taiwan. In 2002, he helped spearhead the local campaign against building a light rail system in Hamilton County.

As of 2016, Chabot had traveled on congressional fact-finding missions to 46 countries at a cost of $200,000.

==Personal life==
Chabot lives with his wife Donna in Westwood. They have two children and a grandson.

Chabot is a practicing Roman Catholic.

<doc id="703453" wikidata="Q351856" url="?curid=703453" title="Henri II, Prince of Condé">
<text>Henri II de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (1 September 1588 – 26 December 1646) was a French prince who was the head of the House of Bourbon-Condé, the senior-most cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. From the age of 2 to 12, Henri was the presumptive heir to the French throne. Henri was the father of general Louis, le Grand Condé.

==Life==
Henri was born in 1588, the third child and only son of Henri I, Prince of Condé and Charlotte Catherine de La Trémoille, daughter of Louis III de La Trémoille, Duke of Thouars. He had two older sisters: Catherine de Bourbon, his paternal half-sister who died unmarried in 1595, and Éléonore de Bourbon, who was married in 1606 at the age of 19 to 51-year-old Philip William, Prince of Orange.

Henri was a posthumous child, his father having died nearly six months before his birth. He became Prince of Condé within weeks of his birth, after being recognized and confirmed by the King of France. 

Henri was born in prison after the arrest of his then-pregnant mother in the spring of 1588, following her husband&#x27;s death, under suspicion that she may have poisoned him. She and her children were released from their captivity after Jacques Auguste de Thou intervened on her behalf with King Henry IV, who was a relative of the young prince.
Henry III of France died in August 1589, when Henri was less than one year old, and was succeeded by Henry IV of France, who was the first cousin of Henri&#x27;s late father. Less than a year later, the new king&#x27;s uncle (Henri&#x27;s great uncle) and initial heir, Cardinal Charles, died. This made Henri the King&#x27;s closest agnatic kin, and he was First Prince of the blood and heir presumptive to the throne of France for 12 years, until the birth of the future Louis XIII of France in September 1601.

Henri was raised as a Catholic at the insistence of Pope Clement VIII. Henri&#x27;s father and grandfather had been leaders of the Calvinist Huguenots.

Henri was raised at court but never regarded as a favorite, as he was regarded with suspicion for his potential claims to the throne. Henri grew into what his contemporary Bassompierre described as a &quot;not amiable&quot; young man who was quick to take offense. He much preferred hunting and military life to being at court.

His appearance and personality was described by a contemporary as:

Small and thin, he has very prominent facial features, as all those of the House of Bourbon usually do; he is blond and has the lively French temperament. I find him witty, but he is frivolous and often imprudent in the choice of his confidants. He speaks Latin and Italian, has Spanish and speaks it a little; he is well versed in sacred and secular letters, having had Nicolas le Febvre as his tutor, and pushes his zeal for the Catholic religion very far.

His position at court was further undermined by his relative poverty and much damaged by the court intrigues of his mother, which eventually resulted in her banishment from court. Henri himself was made to deliver the news of the banishment to his mother.

In 1609, his marriage with Charlotte de Montmorency was arranged, allegedly because his uncle the king was infatuated with her and expected his nephew would allow Henry IV to take Charlotte as a mistress. Because both bride and groom were first cousins, a papal dispensation was needed. A dispensation was granted and the wedding took place at the bride&#x27;s father&#x27;s home in Chantilly. 

Instead of bringing his wife to court as the king had demanded, Henri instead took Charlotte first to the Chateau de Breteuil and then to the Château de Muret-et-Crouttes, Henri&#x27;s home in the country, where she remained under the supervision of her mother-in-law. Charlotte wrote letters to her Montmorency relatives calling herself &quot;la pauvre prisonnière&quot; (&quot;the poor prisoner&quot;). 

The king continued to demand that Henri bring his wife to court. However, Henri instead went to Muret-et-Crouttes, where he arranged a carriage and escaped with his wife to Brussels, which was then part of the Spanish Netherlands. 

Some months later, in February 1610, Henri relocated alone to Milan, where the Spanish government was more than happy to defy the French king&#x27;s request to turn over the prince. Henri took up residence in the palace of the Governor of Milan, Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes, who supplied him with a bodyguard.

Henry IV was assassinated on 14 May 1610. Finally free to return to France, Henri returned to Paris in July 1610 and was greeted by many nobles, the young king Louis XIII and the queen mother Marie de Medicis. Restored to grace, he was reinstated at court.

From 1612 to 1616, Henri was Lieutenant General of New France. He was made governor of Berry.

== Imprisonment ==
Condé was accused of wanting to become the king through a coup and although there was no concrete evidence to back this up, Queen Marie de Medici had him arrested and imprisoned in the Bastille. He was joined by his wife who wanted to share her husband&#x27;s captivity.

Because of his bad health, the couple was transferred to the Chateau de Vincennes. They had a stillborn son during this time, and it was feared Charlotte would die too. The couple had two more children die at birth during their imprisonment, and they were not released until after the birth of their daughter Genevieve.
== Later life ==
From 1611 to 1638, Henri was second in line to the throne of France behind Gaston, Duke of Orleans. This was the period between the death of Nicolas Henri, Duke of Orleans in November 1611 and the birth of the future Louis XIV of France in September 1638.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1609, Henri married Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, daughter of Henri I de Montmorency, Duke of Montmorency by his second wife, Louise de Budos. In 1610, Marie de Médici, wife of King Henry IV, gave the Hôtel de Condé in Paris to Henri as part of a recompense for his agreeing to marry Charlotte. From then on, the Hôtel de Condé became the main residence of the Princes of Condé until 1764. Henri and Charlotte had six children, three of whom survived to adulthood and were all protagonists of the &quot;Fronde&quot;:
* Henriette de Bourbon (3 June 1608 – 10 June 1608), died in infancy.
* Jeanne de Bourbon (3 June 1608 – 10 June 1608), died in infancy.
* Pierre de Bourbon (22 December 1618 – 24 December 1618), died in infancy.
* Anne Geneviève de Bourbon (1619–1679), married Henri II d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville
* Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (1621–1686), the celebrated French general known as &quot;le Grand Condé&quot;. 
*Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti (1629–1666), married Anne Marie Martinozzi, daughter of Girolamo Martinozzi. 

The Condé affair became part of the international conflict known as the War of the Jülich Succession (one of the precursors to the Thirty Years&#x27; War).

The Brampton Board of Trade supports efforts to increase uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, including on-site vaccination clinics at major industrial employers at the height of the pandemic. 

The Brampton Board of Trade supports the implementation of affordable childcare. 

The Brampton Board of Trade supports urgent solutions to the crisis in the housing market, including interventions such as ending exclusionary zoning to build the “missing middle” by increasing the supply of multi-unit complexes in areas not zoned for them. 

The Brampton Board of Trade supports an engaging municipal budget process that includes proactive stakeholder consultation, as well as disclosure of relevant documents related to capital expenditures and capital planning well in advance. The Board has also taken the position that longer-range capital forecasting will strengthen the city’s hand in competing for capital funding from senior orders of government. 

The Brampton Board of Trade supports the investment necessary to complete and fully unlock the potential of Riverwalk. 

The Brampton Board of Trade supports increasing the number of immigrants admitted under given categories based on workforce needs, and has called on government to work together to more quickly recognize international credentials in fields experiencing labour shortages in Ontario. 

The Brampton Board of Trade has called on the federal and provincial governments to work together to break down barriers to interprovincial trade, and has called on the federal government to redouble efforts to secure free trade agreements with emerging economies such as India. 

=== Brampton Santa Claus Parade ===

Brampton&#x27;s Santa Claus parade stopped in the mid-1970s. In 1985, the Brampton Board of Trade started planning a Santa Claus parade for 1986; simultaneously, the Jaycees were intending to start a parade in 1987. With City co-operation, the Board&#x27;s parade launched in 1986, with Jaycee assistance in marshalling. That year&#x27;s program was announced to include forty community entrants, sponsored by companies, but ended up with 52 units. In recent years, it has included over 100 units. The parade moved to a &quot;night parade&quot; format in 1995.

The parade route has expanded from Vodden to south of Wellington Street (1986) to Sproule to south of Elgin Street. Temporarily it is on Bramalea Road because of construction in downtown Brampton.

The parade is always on the Third Saturday in November

The Board claims an in-person attendance of 160,000 (2012). It claims to be the largest single-day event in the Regional Municipality of Peel, and the largest night parade in Canada. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has named the parade as the Best Community Lighted Parade in Canada.

The program was broadcast on Rogers TV Brampton, which claimed viewership of over 250,000 between live and repeat broadcasts.

The Board of Trade stopped hosting the parade in 2017, and it is now run by The Brampton Santa Claus Parade Committee Inc.

<doc id="703462" wikidata="Q444087" url="?curid=703462" title="Henri Jules, Prince of Condé">
<text>Henri Jules de Bourbon (29 July 1643, in Paris – 1 April 1709, in Paris, also &quot;Henri III de Bourbon&quot;) was &quot;prince de Condé&quot;, from 1686 to his death. At the end of his life he suffered from clinical lycanthropy and was considered insane.

==Biography==
Henri Jules was born to Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé in 1643. He was five years younger than King Louis XIV of France. He was the sole heir to the enormous Condé fortune and property, including the Hôtel de Condé and the Château de Chantilly. His mother, Princess Claire-Clémence de Maillé-Brézé, was a niece of Cardinal Richelieu. He was baptised at the Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris on his day of birth. For the first three years of his life, while his father was &quot;duc d&#x27;Enghien&quot;, he was known at court as the &quot;duc d&#x27;Albret&quot;.

Upon the death of his grandfather, he succeeded to his father&#x27;s courtesy title of &quot;duc d&#x27;Enghien&quot;. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was born a &quot;prince du sang&quot; and styled as &quot;&quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;&quot;.

=== Childhood and education ===
Because of his father exile from France and fighting for Spain, Henri Jules spent much of his youth in the Spanish Netherlands where he was also beginning in 1652 when he was seven years old educated by Pierre Bourdelot who taught him Latin. The following year Henri Jules was enrolled in a Jesuit school in Namur to be taught alongside other children.

Throughout much of his life, Henri Jules was mentally unstable. His maternal grandmother Nicole du Plessis, sister to the Cardinal Richelieu had suffered from the belief that her bottom was made of glass and therefore refused to sit down. Henri-Jules delusions manifested themselves in that he would imagine himself a dog and would bark like one. 

He was a short, ugly, debauched, and brutal man not only &quot;repulsive in appearance&quot;, but &quot;cursed with so violent a temper that it was positively dangerous to contradict him&quot;. He was well educated but had a malicious character. 

Trained as a soldier, in 1673 he was made official commander of the Rhine front, but in name only, as he lacked the military ability of his father. He also displayed a recklessness in battle and this lack of judgement made him as much a threat to his own troops as the enemy. His father would instead transfer his hopes on a worthy military successor for the Condé name on Henri-Jules cousin Francois-Louis.

Henri Jules was accorded the responsibility of governing the Condé estates, a task for which he proved to be much more suitable.

A possible bride considered for him at this time was his distant cousin, Élisabeth Marguerite d&#x27;Orléans, daughter of Gaston d&#x27;Orléans, but the marriage did not materialize.

=== Marriage ===
He eventually married the German princess Anne Henriette of Bavaria in the chapel of the Palais du Louvre in Paris in December 1663. The bride was the daughter of Edward, Count Palatine of Simmern and the political hostess Anna Gonzaga. The couple had ten children, only half of whom lived to adulthood. The young princess was noted for her pious, generous and charitable nature. Many at court praised her for her solicitude towards her disagreeable husband. Despite her good qualities, Henri Jules often beat his quiet wife during his rages.

In addition, he had an illegitimate daughter by Françoise-Charlotte de Montalais (1633-1718). The child was known variously as Julie de Bourbon, Julie de Gheneni (anagram of Enghien, aka de Guenani), or &quot;Mademoiselle de Châteaubriant&quot;. She was legitimised in 1693 at 25 years of age and was married to Armand de Madaillan de Lesparre, Marquis de Lassay, a member of her fathers entourage. She died on 10 March 1710, at age 43.

== Later life ==
Henri Jules mental instability worsened towards the later end of his life and he became convinced that he was already deceased and therefore he began taking his meals in an underground chamber which he was convinced was the home of M. de Turenne. He would also invite guests to this chamber to dine with him and pretend they were also dead and converse on the afterlife. while served by servants dressed in white sheets.

Though all indications point to his actions being a symptom of his mental illness it should also be noted that he was a fervent Jansenist and part of that belief included preparing for ones death through reflection and lausterious living,and learning how to die well.

== Death ==
Henry Jules was succeeded by his only surviving son, Louis III de Bourbon, who only survived his father by a few months.Therefore the title passed to Henri Jules grandson Louis-Henri.

<text>Louis III de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (10 November 1668 – 4 March 1710) was a &quot;prince du sang&quot; as a member of the reigning House of Bourbon at the French court of Louis XIV. Styled as Duke of Bourbon from birth, he succeeded his father in 1709 as Prince of Condé (); however, he was still known by the ducal title. He was prince for less than a year.

==Biography==
Louis de Bourbon, &quot;duc de Bourbon&quot;, &quot;duc de Montmorency&quot; (1668–1689), &quot;duc d&#x27;Enghien&quot; (1689–1709), &quot;6th Prince of Condé&quot;, &quot;comte de Sancerre&quot; (1709–1710), &quot;comte de Charolais&quot; (1709), was born at the Hôtel de Condé in Paris on 10 November 1668 and died at the Palace of Versailles on 4 March 1710. He was the eldest son of Henri Jules de Bourbon, Prince of Condé and Anne Henriette of Bavaria, and the grandson of &quot;le Grand Condé&quot;.

One of nine children, he was his parents&#x27; eldest surviving son. His sister, Marie Thérèse de Bourbon, married François Louis, Prince of Conti in 1688. Another sister, Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon, would marry Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine, a legitimised son of Louis XIV, in 1692. His youngest sister, Marie Anne de Bourbon, much later married the famous general Louis Joseph de Bourbon.

He was made a &quot;Chevalier du Saint-Esprit&quot; in 1686, a colonel of the &quot;Bourbon-Infanterie&quot; Regiment later that same year, a &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1690, and a lieutenant general in 1692. Upon the death of his father, he inherited all the Condé titles and estates.

==Marriage==
In 1685, Louis married Louise Françoise de Bourbon, known at court as &quot;Mademoiselle de Nantes&quot;, who was the eldest legitimised daughter of King Louis XIV of France and his mistress, Madame de Montespan. In an age where dynastic considerations played a major role, eyebrows at court were raised at a marriage between a full-blooded &quot;prince du sang&quot; and a royal bastard. The head of the House of Condé, &quot;le Grand Condé&quot;, however, acquiesced to the socially inferior match in the hope of gaining favour with the bride&#x27;s father, Louis XIV.

The seventeen-year-old &quot;duc de Bourbon&quot; was known at court as &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;. After the marriage, his wife assumed the style of &quot;Madame la Duchesse&quot;. Like his father, who became Prince of Condé in 1687, Louis de Bourbon led a typical, unremarkable life. At a time when five-and-a-half feet was considered a normal height for a woman, Louis, while not quite a dwarf, was considered a short man. His sisters, in fact, were so tiny that they were referred to as &quot;dolls of the Blood&quot;, or, less flatteringly, as &quot;little black beetles&quot; since many of them were dark in complexion and hunchbacked. While not suffering from this condition himself, Louis was macrocephalic. In addition, his skin tone was said to have a definite yellowish-orange tint to it. On the plus side, while no scholar, Louis was respectably well educated. Similarly, while certainly no fool, he was not burdened with too much intelligence for his time and station in life.

==Prince of Condé==

Louis was &quot;prince de Condé&quot; for a little less than a year, as he died only eleven months after his father. Like his father, Louis was hopelessly insane, having slipped into madness several years before his actual death, &quot;making horrible faces&quot;, as one historian noted. Louis died in 1710 at the age of 41.

<text>Robert Jones Portman (born December 19, 1955) is an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator from Ohio from 2011 to 2023. A member of the Republican Party, Portman was the 35th director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from 2006 to 2007, the 14th United States trade representative from 2005 to 2006, and a U.S. representative from 1993 to 2005, representing Ohio&#x27;s 2nd district.

In 1993, Portman won a special election to represent in the United States House of Representatives. He was reelected six times before resigning upon his appointment by President George W. Bush as the U.S. trade representative in May 2005. As trade representative, Portman initiated trade agreements with other countries and pursued claims at the World Trade Organization. In May 2006, Bush appointed Portman the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

In 2010, Portman announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat being vacated by George Voinovich. He easily defeated then-Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher and was reelected in 2016, defeating former Governor Ted Strickland. On January 25, 2021, he announced that he would not seek a third term in 2022.

After leaving office in 2023, Portman founded The Portman Center for Policy Solutions at the University of Cincinnati. He currently serves as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow in the Practice of Public Policy at the American Enterprise Institute. Additionally, he currently serves as an independent director at Procter &amp; Gamble

==Early life==
Portman was born in 1955, in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Joan (née Jones) and William C. &quot;Bill&quot; Portman II. His family was Presbyterian.


In 1926, Portman&#x27;s grandfather Robert Jones purchased the Golden Lamb Inn in Lebanon, Ohio, and, together with his future wife Virginia Kunkle Jones, refurbished it and decorated it with antique collectibles and Shaker furniture. The couple ran the inn together until 1969, when they retired.

When Portman was young, his father started the Portman Equipment Company, a forklift dealership where he and his siblings worked growing up. From his mother Joan, a liberal Republican, Portman inherited his sympathy for the Republican Party.

==Education and early career==
Portman graduated from Cincinnati Country Day School in 1974 and attended Dartmouth College, where he started leaning to the right, and majored in anthropology and earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1978. In Cincinnati, Portman worked on Bill Gradison&#x27;s congressional campaign, and Gradison soon became a mentor to Portman. Portman next entered the University of Michigan Law School, earning his Juris Doctor degree in 1984 and serving as vice president of the student senate. During law school, he embarked on a kayaking and hiking trip across China and met Jane Dudley, whom he married in 1986. After graduating from law school, Portman moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the law firm Patton Boggs. Some describe his role there as a lobbyist; others say that such a description is inaccurate. Portman next became an associate at Graydon Head &amp; Ritchey LLP, a law firm in Cincinnati.

In 1989, Portman began his career in government as an associate White House Counsel under President George H. W. Bush. From 1989 to 1991, he served as Bush&#x27;s deputy assistant and director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. While serving as White House counsel, Portman visited China, Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

==United States Representative: 1993–2005==
In 1993, Portman entered a special election to fill the seat of Congressman Bill Gradison of Ohio&#x27;s second congressional district, who had stepped down to become president of the Health Insurance Association of America. In the Republican primary, Portman faced six-term Congressman Bob McEwen, who had lost his Sixth District seat to Ted Strickland in November 1992; real estate developer Jay Buchert, president of the National Association of Home Builders; and several lesser known candidates.

In the primary, Portman was criticized for his previous law firm&#x27;s work for Haitian president Baby Doc Duvalier. Buchert ran campaign commercials labeling Portman and McEwen &quot;Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob.&quot; Portman lost four of the district&#x27;s five counties, but won the largest, Hamilton County, his home county and home to 57% of the district&#x27;s population. Largely on the strength of his victory in Hamilton, Portman took 17,531 votes (36%) overall, making him the winner.

In the general election, Portman defeated the Democratic nominee, attorney Lee Hornberger, 53,020 (70%) to 22,652 (29%).

Portman was reelected in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004, defeating Democrats Les Mann, Thomas R. Chandler, and then Waynesville mayor Charles W. Sanders four times in a row.

===House legislative career===

As of 2004, Portman had a lifetime rating of 89 from the American Conservative Union, and ranked 5th among Ohio&#x27;s 18 House members.

One of Portman&#x27;s first votes in Congress was for the North American Free Trade Agreement on November 17, 1993.

Of Portman&#x27;s work on the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union said, &quot;He set a professional work environment that rose above partisanship and ultimately gave taxpayers more rights.&quot; Democratic Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones from Cleveland said Portman, &quot;compared to other Republicans, is pleasant and good to work with.&quot; During the first four years of the George W. Bush Administration, Portman served as a liaison between congressional Republicans and the White House. Portman voted for the Iraq War Resolution in 2002. He was known for his willingness to work with Democrats to enact important legislation.

Portman has said that his proudest moments as a U.S. Representative were &quot;when we passed the balanced budget agreement and the welfare reform bill.&quot; As a congressman, Portman traveled to Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Mexico. During his time in the House, Portman began assisting prominent Republican candidates prepare for debates by standing in for their opponents in practice debates. He took the role of Lamar Alexander (for Bob Dole in 1996), Al Gore (for George W. Bush in 2000), Hillary Clinton (for Rick Lazio in 2000), Joe Lieberman (for Dick Cheney in 2000), John Edwards (for Cheney in 2004), and Barack Obama (for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012). His portrayals mimic not only the person&#x27;s point of view but also their mannerisms, noting for instance that he listened to Obama&#x27;s audiobook reading to study his pattern of speech.
==George W. Bush administration: 2005–2007==
===United States Trade Representative===
On March 17, 2005, Portman spoke at the White House during a ceremony at which Bush nominated him for United States Trade Representative, calling him &quot;a good friend, a decent man, and a skilled negotiator.&quot; Portman was confirmed on April 29 and sworn in on May 17.

Portman sponsored an unfair-trading claim to the World Trade Organization against Airbus because American allies in the European Union were providing subsidies that arguably helped Airbus compete against Boeing. European officials countered that Boeing received unfair subsidies from the United States, and the WTO ruled separately that they each received unfair government assistance.

Portman spent significant time out of the United States negotiating trade agreements with roughly 30 countries, visiting Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, South Korea, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. During his tenure, he also helped to win passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Portman used a network of former House colleagues to get support for the treaty to lift trade barriers between the United States and Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras. According to &quot;The Hill&quot;, Portman took his wife, Jane, with him to the Capitol on their wedding anniversary so he could work on the deal.

====Hong Kong and trade suit====
As United States Trade Representative, Portman attended the WTO&#x27;s Hong Kong conference in 2005. He addressed the conference with a speech on development in Doha, and advocated a 60% cut in targeted worldwide agricultural subsidies by 2010. Portman then sponsored a claim against China for extra charges it levied on American auto parts. U.S. steel manufacturers subsequently beseeched the White House to halt an influx of Chinese steel pipe used to make plumbing and fence materials. This was a recurring complaint and the United States International Trade Commission recommended imposing import quotas, noting &quot;the economic threat to the domestic pipe industry from the Chinese surge.&quot; With Portman as his top trade advisor, Bush replied that quotas were in the U.S. economic interest. He reasoned the American homebuilding industry used the pipe and wanted to maintain a cheap supply and that other cheap exporters would step in to fill China&#x27;s void if Chinese exports were curtailed. This occurred at a time when the U.S. steel industry lost $150 million in profit between 2005 and 2007, although China&#x27;s minister of commerce cited the U.S. industry&#x27;s &quot;record high profit margins&quot; in the first half of 2004 and continued growth in 2005. China next lobbied Portman to leave matters alone, meeting with his office twice and threatening in a letter that restrictions and what it called &quot;discrimination against Chinese products&quot; would bring &quot;serious adverse impact&quot; to the U.S.-China economic and trade relationship. Portman vowed to &quot;hold [China&#x27;s] feet to the fire&quot; and provide a &quot;top-to-bottom review&quot; of the U.S.–China trade relationship. His claim that China had improperly favored domestic auto parts became the first successful trade suit against China in the WTO. During Portman&#x27;s tenure as trade ambassador, the U.S. trade deficit with China increased by 21 percent.

===Director of the Office of Management and Budget===
On April 18, 2006, Bush nominated Portman for Director of the Office of Management and Budget, replacing Joshua Bolten, who was appointed White House Chief of Staff. Portman said that he looked forward to the responsibility, adding, &quot;It&#x27;s a big job. The Office of Management and Budget touches every spending and policy decision in the federal government&quot;. Bush expressed his confidence in Portman, saying, &quot;The job of OMB director is a really important post and Rob Portman is the right man to take it on. Rob&#x27;s talent, expertise and record of success are well known within my administration and on Capitol Hill.&quot; The U.S. Senate confirmed him unanimously by voice vote on May 26, 2006.

As OMB director from May 2006 to August 2007, Portman helped craft a $2.9 trillion budget for fiscal year 2008. &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; wrote, &quot;The plan called for making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, at a cost of more than $500 billion over the five-year life of the proposal. It requested a hefty increase in military spending, along with reductions in low-income housing assistance, environmental initiatives, and health care safety-net programs.&quot; Portman is said to have been &quot;frustrated&quot; with the post, calling the budget that Bush&#x27;s office sent to Congress &quot;not my budget, his budget,&quot; and saying, &quot;it was a fight, internally.&quot; Edward Lazear of Bush&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers said that Portman was the leading advocate for a balanced budget, while other former Bush administration officials said that Portman was the leading advocate for fiscal discipline within the administration.

On June 19, 2007, Portman resigned as OMB director, citing a desire to spend more time with his family and three children. Democratic Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Kent Conrad expressed regret at Portman&#x27;s resignation, saying, &quot;He is a person of credibility and decency that commanded respect on both sides of the aisle.&quot;

==Post-White House career==
On November 8, 2007, Portman joined the law firm Squire Sanders as part of its transactional and international trade practice in Cincinnati, Ohio. His longtime chief of staff, Rob Lehman, also joined the firm as a lobbyist in its Washington, D.C. office. In 2007, Portman founded Ohio&#x27;s Future P.A.C., a political action committee. In 2008, he was cited as a potential running mate for Republican presidential nominee John McCain. Portman remained critical of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, passed while he was out of office.

==United States Senator: 2011–2023==

===Elections===

==== 2010 ====

On January 14, 2009, two days after George Voinovich announced he would not be running for re-election, Portman publicly declared his candidacy for the open U.S. Senate seat. Running unopposed in the Republican primary, Portman benefitted substantially from Tea Party support, and by July 2010 had raised more campaign funds than Democrat Lee Fisher by a 9 to 1 margin. Portman campaigned on the issue of jobs and job growth.

Of all candidates for public office in the US, Portman was the top recipient of corporate money from insurance industries and commercial banks in 2010. Portman possessed the most campaign funds of any Republican during 2010, at $5.1 million, raising $1.3 million in his third quarter of fundraising.

Portman won the election by a margin of 57 to 39 percent, winning 82 of Ohio&#x27;s 88 counties. In a 2010 campaign advertisement, Portman said a &quot;[ cap-and-trade bill] could cost Ohio 100,000 jobs we cannot afford to lose;&quot; subsequently, &quot;The Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; and PolitiFact called Portman&#x27;s claim &quot;barely true&quot; with the most pessimistic estimates.

==== 2016 ====

The 2016 re-election campaign posed several special challenges to Portman and his team—it would be run in heavily targeted Ohio, it would occur in a presidential year when Democratic turnout was expected to peak, and both parties would bombard Ohio voters with tens of millions of dollars in TV, cable and digital ads for the national, senatorial and downticket contests. For his campaign manager, Portman chose Corry Bliss, who had just run the successful re-election of Sen. Pat Roberts in Kansas. Portman and Bliss chose to run what &quot;Time&quot; magazine called &quot;a hyperlocal campaign without betting on the nominee&#x27;s coattails.&quot;

As Real Clear Politics noted, Portman faced &quot;the thorny challenge of keeping distance from Trump in a state Trump [was] poised to win. Portman, in the year of the outsider, [was] even more of an insider than Clinton ... Yet he [ran] a local campaign focused on issues like human trafficking and opioid addiction, and secured the endorsement of the Teamsters as well as other unions&quot; (despite being a mostly conservative Republican).

Polls showed the race even (or Portman slightly behind) as of June 2016; afterwards, Portman led Democratic ex-Gov. Ted Strickland in every public survey through Election Day. The final result was 58.0% to 37.2%, nearly a 21-point margin for Portman.

Chris Cillizza of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; argued that the context of Ohio&#x27;s result had wider implications. &quot;There are a lot of reasons Republicans held the Senate this fall. But Portman&#x27;s candidacy in Ohio is the most important one. Portman took a seemingly competitive race in a swing state and put it out of reach by Labor Day, allowing money that was ticketed for his state to be in other races, such as North Carolina and Missouri ...&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;Portman took the crown for best campaign&quot;, while &quot;Real Clear Politics&quot; said, &quot;Sen. Rob Portman ran the campaign of the year.&quot;. Portman himself was generous in praising his campaign manager: &quot;With an emphasis on utilizing data, grassroots, and technology, Corry led our campaign from behind in the polls to a 21-point victory. He&#x27;s one of the best strategists in the country.&quot;

===Tenure===

In the 112th Congress, Portman voted with his party 90% of the time. However, in the 114th United States Congress, Portman was ranked as the third most bipartisan member of the U.S. Senate by the Bipartisan Index, a metric created jointly by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy to reflect congressional bipartisanship. During the first session of the 115th Congress, Portman&#x27;s bipartisanship score improved further, propelling him to second in the Senate rankings (only Senator Susan Collins scoring higher), Portman&#x27;s intellectual leadership among the Senate G.O.P., and his fundraising capabilities, led to his being named the Vice Chairman for Finance of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 2014 election cycle. In March 2013, Portman was one of several Republican senators invited to have dinner with President Obama at The Jefferson Hotel in an attempt by the administration to court perceived moderate members of the upper chamber for building consensual motivation in Congress; however, Portman did not attend and instead had dinner with an unnamed Democratic senator.

Portman delivered the eulogy at the August 2012 funeral of Neil Armstrong, and the commencement address at the University of Cincinnati&#x27;s December 2012 graduation ceremony.

In August 2011, Portman was selected by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to participate in the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. During the committee&#x27;s work, Portman developed strong relationships with the other members, especially Sen. John Kerry and Rep. Chris Van Hollen. The committee was ultimately unsuccessful, with Portman left disappointed, saying &quot;I am very sad about this process not succeeding because it was a unique opportunity to both address the fiscal crisis and give the economy a shot in the arm.&quot;

Portman spoke at the May 7, 2011 Michigan Law School commencement ceremonies, which was the subject of criticism by some who opposed his stance on same-sex marriage. He and his wife walked in the 50th anniversary march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge commemorating Bloody Sunday and the March on Selma.

On January 25, 2021, Portman announced that he would not run for a third term in 2022. In a statement, he said he looked forward to &quot;focus[ing] all my energy on legislation and the challenges our country faces rather than on fundraising and campaigning.&quot; He added, &quot;I have consistently been named one of the most bipartisan senators. I am proud of that and I will continue to reach out to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common ground. Eighty-two of my bills were signed into law by President Trump, and 68 were signed into law by President Obama.&quot; Of why he chose not to seek another term, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision.&quot;

==Political positions==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, while in the Senate, Portman portrayed himself as a &quot;deficit hawk&quot; and was &quot;considered a centrist-to-conservative Republican&quot; who has typically voted with the party leadership, although he broke with it on a number of issues, including same-sex marriage. In 2013, Portman was several times described as staunchly conservative. During the Trump administration, Portman was characterized as a centrist or moderate Republican. In 2020, Portman&#x27;s former campaign manager described him as a &quot;proud conservative&quot;. Chris Cillizza, writing in 2014, described Portman as more governance-oriented than campaign-oriented.

GovTrack places Portman toward the center of the Senate&#x27;s ideological spectrum; according to GovTrack&#x27;s analysis, Portman is the third most moderate Republican in 2017 being to the right of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski but to the left of his other Republican colleagues. The American Conservative Union gives Portman a lifetime 79% conservative grade. The progressive Americans for Democratic Action gave Portman a 25% liberal quotient in 2014. The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Portman a 2013 composite ideology score of 71% conservative and 29% liberal.

According to &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, which tracks congressional records, Portman voted in line with Trump&#x27;s position on legislation 90.4% of the time. As of October 2022, he had voted with Biden&#x27;s positions about 61.8% of the time. CQ RollCall, which also tracks voting records, found that Portman voted with President Obama&#x27;s positions on legislation 59.5% of the time in 2011. He was one of five Senate Republicans who voted with Obama&#x27;s position more than half the time.

===2012 presidential election===

Portman was considered a possible pick for vice president on the Republican presidential ticket in 2012. Chris Cillizza wrote that Portman&#x27;s time in both the executive and legislative branches would qualify him for the role.

After Mitt Romney selected Paul Ryan as his running mate, Portman spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention about trade and his family business. On trade agreements, Portman stated: &quot;President Obama is the first president in 75 years-Democrat or Republican-who hasn&#x27;t even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas. Now why is this important? Because 95 percent of the world&#x27;s consumers live outside our borders. And to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people.&quot; In October 2012, Romney spoke at and toured Portman&#x27;s Golden Lamb Inn.

Portman portrayed President Obama in Romney&#x27;s mock debate sessions for the general election, reprising a role that he played in the debate preparations of Republican presidential nominee John McCain in 2008.

===2016 presidential campaign===

In March 2014, Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia Center for Politics speculated that Portman might run for president in 2016. In October 2014, students from the College of William and Mary formed the Draft Rob Portman PAC to encourage Portman to run for president in 2016. However, Portman announced in December 2014 that he would not run for president and would instead seek a second term in the United States Senate.

Portman initially endorsed his fellow Ohioan, Governor John Kasich, during the Republican primaries. In May 2016, after Kasich dropped out of the race and Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee, Portman endorsed Trump. After the emergence of old audio recordings where Trump bragged about inappropriately touching women without their consent in October 2016, Portman announced that he was rescinding his endorsement of Trump and would instead cast a write-in vote for Trump&#x27;s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.

===2020 campaign, Capitol attack, and Trump impeachments===
In the 2020 presidential election, Portman supported Trump, in a reversal of his 2016 vote. Portman maintained his support for Trump during the impeachment proceedings against Trump for his conduct in the Trump–Ukraine scandal. Portman said that it was &quot;wrong and inappropriate&quot; for Trump to ask a foreign government to investigate a political rival, and that he accepted that there was &quot;quid pro quo&quot; between Trump and Ukraine in which U.S. aid to Ukraine was on the line, but that he did not consider it to be an impeachable offense. Following the Senate trial of Trump, Portman voted to acquit Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Portman also opposed proposals to formally censure Trump.

Portman was the Ohio state co-chair of Trump&#x27;s 2020 re-election campaign. After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Trump refused to concede, Portman initially refused to acknowledge Biden as the president-elect of the United States, although he did acknowledge that it was appropriate for Biden&#x27;s transition to begin and that, contrary to Trump&#x27;s false claims, there was no evidence of irregularities that would change the election outcome. Portman accepted the election results six weeks after the election, after the December 15 Electoral College vote.

Portman opposed Trump&#x27;s attempt to overturn the election results, and did not back a last-ditch effort by Trump&#x27;s Republican allies in Congress to object to the formal counting of the electoral votes from swing states in which Biden defeated Trump. Portman said, &quot;I cannot support allowing Congress to thwart the will of the voters&quot; and voted against the objections. Congress&#x27;s counting of the electoral votes was interrupted by a pro-Trump mob that attempted an insurrection at the Capitol; Portman said Trump &quot;bears some responsibility&quot; for the attack. After Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for incitement of insurrection, Portman joined most Republican senators in an unsuccessful motion to dismiss the charges and avoid a Senate impeachment trial on the basis that Trump&#x27;s term had expired and he had become a private citizen. On February 13, 2021, Portman voted to acquit Trump on charges of inciting the January 6 attack on the Capitol.

===January 6 commission===
On May 27, 2021, along with five other Republicans and all present Democrats, Portman voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack. The vote failed for the lack of 60 required &quot;yes&quot; votes.

===Abortion===
On abortion, Portman describes himself as pro-life. He voted in favor of banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Portman supports legal access to abortion in cases of rape and incest or if the woman&#x27;s life is in danger. National Right to Life Committee and the Campaign for Working Families, both anti-abortion PACs, gave Portman a 100% rating in 2018; NARAL Pro-Choice America gives him a 0%, Planned Parenthood, which is pro-choice, gives him a lifetime 4% rating, and Population Connection, another pro-choice PAC, gave Portman an 11% rating in 2002.

In 2013, Portman sponsored a bill that would have made it a federal crime to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion if doing so would circumvent state parental consent or notification laws.

=== SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act ===
In July 2022, Portman voted for the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, which would provide care for veterans suffering from diseases caused by burn pit exposure while serving overseas. He put out a press release celebrating his vote, but changed his position when the House returned the final version of the bill to the Senate, and voted against it.

===Budget and economy===
Portman is a leading advocate for a balanced budget amendment. Portman worked with Democratic Senator Jon Tester in 2012 to end the practice of government shutdowns and partnered with Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill on an inquiry into the Obama administration&#x27;s public relations spending. Portman has proposed &quot;a balanced approach to the deficit&quot; by reforming entitlement programs, writing &quot;[r]eforms should not merely squeeze health beneficiaries or providers but should rather reshape key aspects of these programs to make them more efficient, flexible and consumer-oriented.&quot; Portman became known for his ability to work in a bipartisan fashion when working to pass a repeal of the excise tax on telephone service. He also unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to the surface transportation reauthorization bill to allow states to keep the gas tax money they collect, instead of sending it to Washington with some returned later. On August 10, 2021, he was one of 19 Republican senators to vote with the Democratic caucus in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In October 2021, Portman voted with 10 other Republicans and every member of the Democratic caucus to end the filibuster on raising the debt ceiling, but voted against the bill to raise the debt ceiling.

===LGBT rights===
While still in the U.S. House, Portman co-sponsored the Defense of Marriage Act, a bill passed in 1996 that banned federal recognition of same-sex marriage; in 1999, he voted for a measure prohibiting same-sex couples in Washington D.C. from adopting children. On March 14, 2013, Portman publicly announced that he had changed his stance on same-sex marriage, and now supported its legalization, becoming the first sitting Republican U.S. senator to do so. The change came two years after his son Will came out to Portman and his wife as gay in 2011. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which supports same-sex marriage and gay rights, gave Portman a 45% score in 2014 and an 85% score in 2016; the HRC also gives Portman a 100% rating for sharing its position on same-sex marriage.

In November 2013, Portman was one of 10 Republican senators to vote for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), after the Senate adopted an amendment he proposed to expand religious protections.

After the House passed a bill to federally protect gay marriage on July 19, 2022, a press spokesman for Portman said he would cosponsor the bill in the Senate. He cosponsored the bill the following day. He was one of 12 Republicans in the Senate voting to advance and pass the Respect for Marriage Act, the legislation protecting federal same-sex marriage rights into federal law.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
Portman voted for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.

===Environment===

In 2011, Portman voted to limit the government&#x27;s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and in 2015, he voted to block the Clean Power Plan. In 2013, he voted for a point of order opposing a carbon tax or a fee on carbon emissions. In 2012, Portman said he wanted more oil drilling on public lands. Portman supported development of the Keystone XL pipeline, stating &quot;The arguments when you line them up are too strong not to do this. I do think that at the end of the day the president [Obama] is going to go ahead with this.&quot;

In 2013, Portman co-sponsored a bill that would reauthorize and modify the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 and would authorize the appropriation of $20.5 million annually through 2018 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to mitigate the harmful effects of algal blooms and hypoxia.

Portman co-sponsored an amendment to the 2017 Energy Bill that acknowledged that climate change is real and human activity contributes to the problem.

===Foreign policy===

Portman opposes U.S. ratification of the Convention on the Law of the Sea.

In March 2016, Portman authored the bipartisan bill Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, along with Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Congressman Adam Kinzinger introduced the U.S. House version of the bill. After the 2016 U.S. presidential election, worries grew that Russian propaganda on social media spread and organized by the Russian government swayed the outcome of the election, and representatives in the U.S. Congress took action to safeguard the National security of the United States by advancing legislation to monitor incoming propaganda from external threats. On November 30, 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department to take action against foreign propaganda through an interagency panel. The legislation authorized funding of $160 million over a two-year-period. The initiative was developed through the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.

==== Israel ====
In 2018 Portman and Senator Ben Cardin co-authored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would make it illegal for companies to engage in boycotts against Israel or Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. They promoted the bill and sought to integrate it into omnibus spending legislation to be signed by Trump.

===Trade ===
Portman supported free trade agreements with Central America, Australia, Chile and Singapore, voted against withdrawing from the World Trade Organization, and was hailed by Bush for his &quot;great record as a champion of free and fair trade.&quot;

Portman has repeatedly supported legislation to treat currency manipulation by countries as an unfair trade practice and to impose duties on Chinese imports if China does not stop the practice. In 2016, Portman opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement because he said it does not address currency manipulation and includes less-strict country-of-origin rules for auto parts. In April 2015, Portman co-sponsored an amendment to Trade Promotion Authority legislation which would require the Obama administration to seek enforceable rules to prevent currency manipulation by trade partners as part of TPP.

In January 2018, Portman was one of 36 Republican senators who asked Trump to preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement.

In November 2018, Portman was one of 12 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement be submitted to Congress by the end of the month to allow a vote on it before the end of the year; the letter-writers cited concerns that &quot;passage of the USMCA as negotiated will become significantly more difficult&quot; if it had to be approved through the incoming 116th Congress, in which there was a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives.

===Gun laws===
Portman has an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), which has endorsed Portman in past elections. According to OpenSecrets, the NRA spent $3.06 million to support Portman between 1990 and 2018.

In 2019, Portman was one of 31 Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz that would allow persons concealed carry privileges in their home state to also carry concealed weapons in other states.

In 2022, Portman became one of ten Republican senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which included a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases.

===Health care===
Portman has worked to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, he voted to repeal it. He opposed steep cuts to Medicaid because the expansion of the program had allowed some Ohioans to gain coverage, including some impacted by Ohio&#x27;s opioid crisis. As a member of a group of 13 Republican senators tasked with writing a Senate version of the AHCA, he supported proposed cuts to Medicaid that would be phased in over seven years.
=== Immigration ===
In June 2018, Portman was one of 13 Republican senators to sign a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting a moratorium on the Trump administration family separation policy while Congress drafted legislation. In March 2019, he was one of a dozen Republicans who broke with their party, joining all Democrats, to vote for a resolution rejecting Trump&#x27;s use of an emergency declaration to build a border wall. He later co-sponsored a bill to provide for congressional approval of national emergency declarations.

Portman opposed Trump&#x27;s Muslim ban, saying the executive order was not &quot;properly vetted&quot; and that he supported the federal judges who blocked its implementation.

===Jobs===
In 2014, Portman voted against reauthorizing long-term unemployment benefits to 1.7 million jobless Americans. He expressed concern about the inclusion of a provision in the bill that would allow companies to make smaller contributions to employee pension funds. In April 2014 Portman voted to extend federal funding for unemployment benefits. Federal funding had been initiated in 2008 and expired at the end of 2013.

In 2014, Portman opposed the Minimum Wage Fairness Act, a bill to phase in, over two years, an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats, but strongly opposed by congressional Republicans.

In 2015, Portman voted for an amendment to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to allow employees to earn paid sick time.

===Judiciary===
In September 2018, Portman said he would support Trump&#x27;s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, saying, &quot;The Brett Kavanaugh I know is a man of integrity and humility&quot;. Portman did not call for an investigation by the FBI for sexual assault allegations.

In September 2020, Portman supported a vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg less than six weeks before the 2020 presidential election. In April 2016, Portman said that Obama&#x27;s nominee to the Supreme Court, who was nominated eight months before the election, should not be considered by the Senate, as it was &quot;a very partisan year and a presidential election year ... it&#x27;s better to have this occur after we&#x27;re past this presidential election.&quot;

===Human trafficking===
Portman has been involved in efforts to end human trafficking. As a member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, he began investigating sex trafficking in 2015. The investigation found that classified advertising website Backpage was aware that the website was being used to sell young girls for sex. Portman sponsored the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which clarified sex trafficking laws to make it illegal to knowingly assist, facilitate, or support sex trafficking. SESTA was passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in April 2018.

=== Biden administration ===

When Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, Portman was one of the few Republicans to say that he would certify the electoral college vote. During Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial, Portman said, &quot;I will keep an open mind when deciding whether to convict&quot;. He ultimately voted not guilty, but said, &quot;Trump&#x27;s comments leading up to the Capitol attack were partly responsible for the violence&quot;.

Portman was one of the main senators involved in crafting the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan that passed the Senate in August 2021.

==Electoral history==












== Personal life ==
Portman married Jane Dudley in July 1986. Dudley, who previously worked for Democratic Congressman Tom Daschle, &quot;agreed to become a Republican when her husband agreed to become a Methodist.&quot; The Portmans attend church services at Hyde Park Community United Methodist Church. The Portmans have three children. Portman still owns the Golden Lamb Inn with his brother Wym Portman and sister Ginna Portman Amis. In 2004, a Dutch conglomerate purchased the Portman Equipment Company. Portman had researched the firm&#x27;s local acquisitions, stating &quot;It&#x27;s a concept I&#x27;ve heard described as &#x27;Glocalism.&#x27; All these companies are trying to achieve economies of scale. This lets us develop a network and coverage globally. But you can still have the local spirit, the local name and the customer intimacy to accomplish great things.&quot; A July 2012 article about Portman stated that in 40 years, his only citation has been a traffic ticket for an improper turn while driving. Portman is an avid kayaker, is fluent in Spanish, and enjoys bike rides.

In December 2004, Portman and Cheryl Bauer published a book on the 19th-century Shaker community at Union Village, in Turtlecreek Township, Warren County, Ohio. The book was titled &quot;Wisdom&#x27;s Paradise: The Forgotten Shakers of Union Village&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==

On August 23, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky awarded Portman the Order of Merit, first class, &quot;For significant personal merits in strengthening interstate cooperation, support of state sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and significant contribution to the popularization of the Ukrainian state in the world.&quot; The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA) honored Portman with several awards during his Senate tenure, including the Friend of UNIS Ukrainian Democracy Award in 2014, the Sevchenko Freedom Award in 2016, and the Lifetime Achievement Award in 2022. In 2022, he received the Star of Ukraine Award from the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation and the Appreciation Award from the United Ukrainian Organizations of Ohio.

<doc id="703465" wikidata="Q455392" url="?curid=703465" title="Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon">
<text>Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon (Louis Henri Joseph; 18 August 1692 – 27 January 1740), was a French nobleman and politician who served as Prime Minister of France from 1723 to 1726. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a &quot;prince du sang&quot;.

Louis Henri was the second child and eldest son of Louis III, Prince of Condé, and Louise Françoise de Bourbon, the eldest daughter of King Louis XIV and his mistress Madame de Montespan. Following the death of his father in 1710, he became head of the Bourbon-Condé cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. As such, he was entitled to be known as Prince of Condé, but he used the title Duke of Bourbon instead and was known at court as &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;. After his maternal grandfather died in 1715, Louis Henri became a member of the regency council led by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, the regent for the new minor king Louis XV.

In 1723, Louis Henri succeeded the Duke of Orléans as chief minister to Louis XV. He negotiated the King&#x27;s marriage to the Polish princess Marie Leszczyńska. In 1726, Louis XV dismissed Louis Henri as chief minister and replaced him with Cardinal de Fleury. Louis Henri died at his manor, the Château de Chantilly, in 1740. His titles were inherited by his 4-year-old son, Louis Joseph.

==Early years==
Louis Henri was born at Versailles, the eldest son of Louis III, Prince of Condé and Louise Françoise de Bourbon, the eldest legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and his &quot;maîtresse-en-titre&quot;, Madame de Montespan.

He was the great-grandson of Louis de Bourbon, &quot;le Grand Condé&quot;, and ranked as a &quot;prince du sang&quot;. Following the death one after the other of the heirs to the throne of France in the early 18th century (except for the &quot;duc d&#x27;Anjou&quot;, great-grandson of Louis XIV and future king as Louis XV) Bourbon was third in the order of succession to the throne, being preceded for a time only by Philippe, the 2nd duc d&#x27;Orléans who became regent, and the latter&#x27;s son, Louis d&#x27;Orléans, duc de Chartres.

He was described in a contemporary description of him as:
Satirical pamphlets directed against royalty were a common form of literature and the chronicles left by courtiers were influenced by rivalries or prejudice, so he may not have looked so bad. Based on collaborating evidence from other sources, however, it is probably safe to assume that he was tall, and not plump.

It is fairly certain he only had the use of one eye:

 probably before he was twenty-five.

==Regency==
In September 1715, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, who had just become regent for the 5-year-old king Louis XV, appointed the then 23-year-old duc de Bourbon to his first Regency Council, the highest consultative body in the French government during the king&#x27;s minority (equivalent to the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;en-haut&quot;, appointed by adult kings).

In 1718, he replaced Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine as superintendent of the king&#x27;s education. This happened at the Regency Council meeting of 26 August, at which Maine and the Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse, legitimised sons (&quot;princes légitimés de France&quot;) of Louis XIV, were demoted in rank. The actual instruction of the young king was not much disturbed however, since it was mostly done by his old and trusted tutor, André-Hercule de Fleury, Bishop of Fréjus, who remained in place.

Many of the surviving descriptions of the duke&#x27;s personality are highly uncomplimentary. They fall under the general categories greed, bad manners, stupidity. For example, Barbier said he &quot;had a very limited mind, knows nothing, and only likes pleasure and hunting.&quot; He was described as pretending to like hunting to ingratiate himself with the king.

==Prime minister==
The Regency ended when Louis XV reached the age of majority, thirteen, in February 1723. Cardinal Dubois, who had been the Regent&#x27;s &quot;premier ministre&quot;, remained in that capacity for the king. However, Dubois died in August 1723. Thereupon the former regent became the king&#x27;s &quot;premier ministre&quot;, until his own death the following 2 December. Bourbon rushed to see the king that very evening and requested the prime ministership. Cardinal de Fleury, who was present at the meeting, recommended acceptance, and Louis XV indicated his assent by a silent nod. Guizot says that Louis &quot;sought in his perceptor&#x27;s [tutor&#x27;s] eyes the guidance he needed&quot;. G. P. Gooch and Perkins also said that Fréjus acquiesced in the appointment. Jones, on the other hand, says that Fréjus was &quot;not&quot; there; also that after the meeting, in order to protect his own influence with the king, which was great, Fréjus got the king to agree never to hold discussions with Bourbon unless he too was present. This was an unusual, and for Bourbon, eventually an intolerable situation. Orléans had been able to see the king whenever he wanted. Within a few years Fréjus was able to assume control of the government himself.

To assess why the king — or Fréjus — chose, or allowed, Bourbon to become &quot;premier ministre&quot;, says the French lawyer and writer d&#x27;Angerville, writing in 1781:

One of Bourbon&#x27;s first moves as prime minister was to replace d&#x27;Argenson, the minister of police, with Nicolas Ravot d&#x27;Ombreval, who was a relative of the marquise de Prie. This gave Bourbon control of press censorship, and also gave him control of much of the mail.

He made the first promotion to the rank of Marshal of France since 1715 — and made some new appointments to France&#x27;s highest chivalric order, the Order of the Holy Spirit (&quot;Ordre du Saint-Esprit&quot;). The recipients were almost all supporters of &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;.

===Persecution of Protestants===

The persecution of the Huguenots under the reign of Louis XIV was stopped by the regent, despite those who continued to advocate rigour in the treatment of the Protestants. Prominent among these was the Archbishop of Rouen, Louis III de La Vergne de Tressan, Grand Almoner of France during the Regency. He argued with both the regent and his most influential minister, Cardinal Dubois, in favour of severe measures against Protestants. They rejected his ideas.

When Bourbon came to be prime minister, however, the bishop found in him a more receptive audience, and he was given the go-ahead to draw up a general law against heresy.

==King&#x27;s affairs==
One of the most notable achievements of the Duke&#x27;s premiership was the arrangement of the King&#x27;s marriage. The King had been betrothed to Mariana Victoria, the &quot;infanta&quot; of Spain, daughter of the Spanish king, in 1721, when she was just three years old, and the French king only eleven. By 1724, the king was fourteen but the &quot;infanta&quot; was still a decade away from child-bearing age. Some felt that this was too long for France to wait for an heir. This was especially so because, if Louis XV died without an heir, it was feared that, armed with a hereditary right he had renounced when he became king of Spain, Philip V de Bourbon, who had recently abdicated the Spanish throne, would ignore the Treaty of Utrecht and claim the French throne, thus plunging France and Spain into conflict with the other European powers.

It appears that by the summer of 1724, the marquise de Prie, and possibly also &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;, were considering breaking Louis XV&#x27;s engagement with the &quot;infanta&quot;, despite the great offence this would cause Spain, and finding him a wife who might provide the country with an heir at an earlier date.

By, at latest, the winter of 1724, replacement of the &quot;infanta&quot; was being considered. Candidates included the Duke&#x27;s sisters, especially &quot;Mademoiselle de Vermandois&quot;. Mme de Prie was opposed to this choice because it would give the duchesse de Bourbon, Vermandois and the duke&#x27;s mother too much influence. The duchess and Mme de Prie did not like each other. Furthermore, Fréjus was opposed to Louis marrying anyone from the Bourbon-Condé branch of the royal family.

In April 1725, the seven-year-old &quot;infanta&quot; was sent back to Madrid — Louis did not even say goodbye to her. A new candidate was sought urgently because, should Louis die with no heir, and assuming Philippe V of Spain did not seize the throne, then it would pass to the new duc d&#x27;Orléans, son of the deceased regent; the House of Orléans and the House of Condé were rivals, so this would cast &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot; into the political wastelands.

Prominent among these was a daughter of George II of Great Britain. The prize was offered to her if she would consent to become a Catholic. However that would have caused great difficulties for her father, as he was occupying the British throne mainly because he was Protestant, whereas his rival, James Stuart, was Catholic; he had to politely decline the offer of France to his daughter.

Another prominent contender was the grand duchess, later empress, Elizabeth of Russia. Others on the list included the Princess Anne Charlotte of Lorraine; a princess of Savoy who was Louis XV&#x27;s first cousin, and the Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg.

==Marie Leszczynska==
The choice finally made was the daughter of the deposed king of Poland. Her name was Marie Leszczyńska; her father, Stanislaus, had occupied the Polish throne from 1704 with the backing of Charles XII of Sweden. He lost it after five years because his sponsor was beaten by Peter the Great of Russia, at Poltava. Stanislaus had found refuge, first in Germany, then in France, where the regent had given him a house at Wissembourg in Alsace, a pension of fifty thousand livres, irregularly paid, and, as a sign of respect, a few regiments of soldiers as an honour guard; they, along with a handful of retainers who had followed the forsaken king in his wanderings, comprised his bare little court. &quot;His property in Poland had been confiscated and his wife&#x27;s jewels pawned.

Marie did not have a reputation for great beauty or intelligence, but she was not ugly, was healthy as well as kind, generous, and calm. She had already been thought of as a wife for the duc de Bourbon. Now he and Mme de Prie decided she would be ideal for the King. On 31 March 1725, the Council met and agreed that the offer would go to Marie Leszczyńska. On 27 May, the name of the Queen-to-be was made public.

The young &quot;duc d&#x27;Orléans&quot; stood in for the bridegroom during the marriage by procuration, which took place in the cathedral of Strasbourg, and was officiated by the Cardinal de Rohan, bishop of Strasbourg and Grand Almoner of France. The bride and groom were wed in person at Fontainebleau.

Bourbon remained prime minister until his dismissal in 1726 in favour of the young king&#x27;s tutor, Cardinal Fleury.

Saint-Simon, the memoir writer known for his acid portraits of grandees, described the Duke of Bourbon as a man with &quot;an almost stupid foolishness, an indomitable obstinacy, an insatiable self-interest&quot;. On the other hand, the Cardinal de Fleury said that he found in the Duke of Bourbon &quot;goodness, probity, and honour&quot; and that he considered himself one of the duke&#x27;s friends.

==Later life==
After his spell in the government, Bourbon was exiled to his country estate, the Château de Chantilly, 40 kilometers northeast of Paris. The château then underwent a sort of &quot;renaissance&quot;, being described as a &quot;splendid residence.&quot;. Bourbon redecorated the building as well as the grounds and entertained there when he could avoid hosting the Parisian set which had banished him. He died there, aged 47. The titles of the Bourbon-Condé family then passed to his 4-year-old son who was to hold the title of prince de Condé for more than seven decades.

==Wealth==
Chantilly porcelain was established by the Prince de Condé. During the Regency his several pensions, together with the income from his extensive estates, gave him an income of 1.8 million &quot;livres&quot;, the historian Bernier, writing in 1984, estimating the &quot;livre&quot; as equivalent to about $4.50.

During the Regency he made large amounts of money by speculating in the financial &quot;Système&quot; (1716–20) of John Law. He bought paper notes, waited for their value to rise, then, before the &quot;Système&quot; failed in 1720, took them to Law&#x27;s bank (which had become the national bank) and traded them in for gold. On 3 March 1720, following the example of the Prince de Conti who the day before had gone to Law&#x27;s bank and withdrawn fourteen million livres in gold in several large carts, Bourbon went to the bank and took away twenty-five million. The bank closed later that year due to lack of reserves. Bourbon made 40 million &quot;livres&quot; off the &quot;Système&quot;, or perhaps 20 million. Historian James Breck Perkins says, &quot;he asked enormous advantages in return for the protection he extended [to John Law and his associates], and the unfortunate adventurer [Law] was not in a position to say no to so powerful a nobleman.&quot; After the &quot;Système&quot; went under, &quot;the government compelled some humbler speculators to disgorge their gains, but no one ventured to disturb the head of the house of Condé.&quot;

==Marriages and issue==
On 9 July 1713 at Versailles, he married Marie Anne de Bourbon who died in 1720. Marie Anne was the eldest daughter of Marie Thérèse de Bourbon and François Louis, Prince de Conti. His younger sister Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, married Marie Anne&#x27;s brother, Louis Armand II de Bourbon, prince de Conti. They had no children. At her death, Marie Anne gave all her property to her sister Mademoiselle de La Roche-sur-Yon.

On 23 July 1728, he married Caroline of Hesse, a daughter of Ernest Leopold, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg and they had one son:

* Louis Joseph de Bourbon (9 August 1736 – 13 May 1818), who led the Army of Condé during the French Revolutionary Wars.

Caroline had once been on a list of possible wives for Louis XV of France. Her husband was pardoned by Louis XV in 1730; this was regarding his exile to the Château de Chantilly in 1725. The couple lived at the &quot;Palais Bourbon&quot; which had been built by her mother-in-law Louise Françoise de Bourbon.

In addition, Louis Henri had an illegitimate daughter with Armande Félice de La Porte Mazarin (1691–1729), the wife of Louis de Mailly, marquis de Nesle (1689–1767), whom he officially recognized,

* Henriette de Bourbon (23 April 1725 – 11 September 1780), &quot;Mademoiselle de Verneuil&quot;, who married Jean, marquis de Laguiche, (1719–1770) in 1740.

<text>Louis Joseph de Bourbon (9 August 1736 – 13 May 1818) was Prince of Condé from 1740 to his death. A member of the House of Bourbon, he held the prestigious rank of &quot;Prince du Sang&quot;.

== Youth ==
Born on 9 August 1736 at Chantilly, Louis Joseph was the only son of Louis Henri I, Prince of Condé (1692–1740) and Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg (1714–41). As a cadet of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a &quot;prince du sang&quot;. His father Louis Henri, was the eldest son of Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (known as &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;) and his wife Louise Françoise de Bourbon, legitimated daughter of Louis XIV and Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, Marquise de Montespan.

During his father&#x27;s lifetime, the infant Louis Joseph was known as the Duke of Enghien, &quot;(duc d&#x27;Enghien)&quot;. At the age of four, following his father&#x27;s death in 1740, and his mother&#x27;s death in 1741, he was placed under the care of his paternal uncle, Louis, Count of Clermont, his father&#x27;s youngest brother.

== Family ==
Louis Joseph had an older half sister, Henriette de Bourbon, &quot;Mademoiselle de Verneuil&quot; (1725–1780).

Through his mother, he was a first cousin of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and of Marie Thérèse of Savoy, Princess de Lamballe. His paternal cousins included Louise Henriette de Bourbon, Duchess of Orléans (mother of Philippe Égalité), the sister of Louis François de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, head of another cadet branch of the royal dynasty. Viktoria of Hesse-Rotenburg, the Princess of Soubise, was another first cousin.

In 1753, Louis Joseph married Charlotte de Rohan, the daughter of the French king Louis XV&#x27;s friend, Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise. Charlotte&#x27;s mother, Anne Marie Louise de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, was a daughter of Emmanuel Théodose de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, the reigning Duke of Bouillon. The couple were married at Versailles on 3 May 1753.

Together, they had three children: a daughter, Marie de Bourbon, who died young; an only son, Louis Henri de Bourbon, who would later become the last Prince of Condé; and a daughter, Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon. In 1770, his son married Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans, daughter of Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, and sister of Philippe &quot;Égalité&quot;. The marriage was supposed to heal relations between the Condé and Orléans branches of the royal family.

Louis Joseph&#x27;s wife Charlotte died in 1760, and as time passed, his relationship with Maria Caterina Brignole, Princess of Monaco, became serious. Maria was the daughter of Giuseppe Brignole, Marquis of Groppoli and Maria Anna Balbi. By 1769, Maria had begun to set up a home in the Hôtel de Lassay, an annex of the Prince of Condé&#x27;s primary residence, the Palais Bourbon. In 1770, her jealous husband, Honoré III, Prince of Monaco, ordered the borders of Monaco closed in an attempt to prevent her from escaping. She managed, nonetheless, to cross into France and found her way to Le Mans, southwest of Paris, where she took refuge in a convent. Eventually, she was able to return to Paris.

Due to Maria Caterina&#x27;s illicit position as the Prince of Condé&#x27;s mistress, the new French queen, 18-year-old Marie Antoinette (wife of King Louis XVI of France), treated her poorly at court, which consequently offended Louis Joseph. In about 1774, Louis Joseph and his mistress Maria began the construction of the Hôtel de Monaco, which was to be her permanent home in Paris. It was in the &quot;rue Saint-Dominique&quot;, near the Palais Bourbon, and was completed in 1777. Subsequently, Prince Honoré of Monaco finally realized his relationship with Maria Caterina was completely finished and thereupon turned his attention to his own love affairs. Maria Caterina later wrote to her husband that their marriage could be summarised in three words: greed, bravery, and jealousy.

== Later life ==
During both the reigns of King Louis XV and his grandson, King Louis XVI, Louis Joseph held the position of &quot;Grand Maître de France&quot; in the King&#x27;s royal household, the Maison du Roi. Obtaining the rank of general, he fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War with some distinction, serving alongside his father-in-law, the Prince of Soubise. He was also Governor of Burgundy.

Furthermore, the Prince was the leader of the Condé army of &quot;émigrés&quot;. He used her great fortune to help finance the exiled French community&#x27;s resistance movement.

In 1765, named the heir of his paternal aunt, Élisabeth Alexandrine de Bourbon, Louis Joseph received generous pensions which Élisabeth Alexandrine had in turn acquired from her cousin, Louise-Françoise de Bourbon. In that same year, Louis Joseph repurchased the Palais Bourbon, previously owned by his family, from King Louis XV, and decided to rebuild it from a country house into a monumental palace, in the new Classical Revival style. With this in mind, he purchased the neighboring &quot;Hôtel de Lassay&quot; in 1768, planning to make the two buildings into one. However, the palace was only finished at the end of the 1780s, when the French Revolution later swept away the old regime. He then moved from the Hôtel de Condé, where he was born, to the Palais Bourbon. The former residence was later sold to King Louis XV in 1770, becoming the subsequent site of the Odéon Theatre. Among other estates, Louis Joseph also inherited the famous Château de Chantilly, the main seat of the Condé line. At Chantilly, the prince conducted a number of improvements and embellishments in the years before the French Revolution. He had the &quot;Château d&#x27;Enghien&quot; built on the grounds of the estate to house guests when the prince entertained at Chantilly. It was constructed in 1769 by the architect, Jean François Leroy, and was later renamed the Château d&#x27;Enghien in honour of his grandson, Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien, who was born at Chantilly in 1772. He also commissioned a large garden in the English style as well as an &quot;hameau&quot;, much like the contemporary one that Queen Marie Antoinette had created at Versailles and at the &quot;Petit Trianon&quot; château.

Louis Joseph lived with his mistress Maria in France until the French Revolution, when the couple left for Germany and then Great Britain. In 1792, he wrote the Brunswick Manifesto, which further spurred French people&#x27;s revolutionary fervor. In 1795, Prince Honoré of Monaco died, and on 24 October 1798, the Prince of Condé and Maria were married in London. The marriage was kept secret for a decade, the couple reportedly becoming openly known as husband and wife only after 26 December 1808.

== Exile ==
During the French Revolution, Louis Joseph was a dedicated supporter of the monarchy and one of the principal leaders of the counter-revolutionary movement. After the storming of the Bastille in 1789, he fled France with his son and grandson, before the &quot;Reign of Terror&quot; which arrested, tried and guillotined most of the Bourbons still living in France: Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and the Duke of Orleans (&quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;) were executed in 1793, and the king&#x27;s sister, Madame Élisabeth, was beheaded in 1794.

Louis Joseph established himself at Coblenz in 1791, where he helped to organize and lead a large counter-revolutionary army of émigrés. In addition to containing the prince&#x27;s grandson, Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé, duc d&#x27;Enghien, and the two sons of his cousin, the late king&#x27;s brother, the comte d&#x27;Artois, the corps included many young aristocrats who eventually became leaders during the Bourbon Restoration years later. This group also included Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu, Pierre Louis Jean Casimir de Blacas and François-René de Chateaubriand. In 1792, he staid with his entourage at Schloss Dürkheim.

The &quot;Army of Condé&quot; initially fought in conjunction with the Austrians. Later, due to differences with the Austrian plan of attack, however, the Prince de Condé entered with his corps into English pay in 1795. In 1796, the army fought in Swabia. In 1797, Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio with the First French Republic, formally ending its hostilities against the French. With the loss of its closest allies, the army transferred into the service of the Russian tsar, Paul I and was stationed in Poland, returning in 1799 to the Rhine under Alexander Suvorov. In 1800 when Russia left the Allied coalition, the army re-entered English service and fought in Bavaria.

The army was disbanded in 1801 without having achieved its principal ambition, restoring Bourbon rule in France. After the dissolution of the corps, the prince spent his exile in England, where he lived with his second wife, Maria Caterina Brignole, the divorced wife of Honoré III, Prince of Monaco, whom he had married in 1798. She died in 1813.

With the defeat of Napoleon, Louis Joseph returned to Paris, where he resumed his courtly duties as &quot;grand maître&quot; in the royal household of Louis XVIII. He died in 1818 and was succeeded by his son, Louis Henri. His daughter, Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon, who was a nun and had become the abbess of Remiremont Abbey, survived until 1824. He was buried at the Basilica of St Denis.

<text>Louis Henri Joseph de Bourbon (13 April 1756 – 30 August 1830) was the Prince of Condé from 1818 to his death. He was the brother-in-law of Philippe Égalité and nephew of Victoire de Rohan.

==Life==
Louis Henri was the only son of Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé by his first wife, Charlotte de Rohan, daughter of Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a &quot;prince du sang&quot; and was entitled to the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, prior to his accession to the Condé title, while he was known as the duke of Enghien and later as &quot;Duke of Bourbon&quot;. On succeeding his father he was entitled to the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

==Marriage==
On 24 April 1770, he married Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans, the only surviving daughter of Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. The couple were married in the chapel at the Palace of Versailles and were descended from Louis XIV to the same degree, their paternal great grandmothers were sisters, daughters of Madame de Montespan. In 1772 their only son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, was born. In March 1778, King Louis XVI&#x27;s youngest brother, the Count of Artois (the future King Charles X), assaulted his wife at a masked ball, leading Louis Henri to challenge him to a duel; &quot;they met early one morning in the Bois de Boulogne, the fight being stopped after the Duke wounded Charles in the hand.&quot; This affair became known as: An Incident at the Opera Ball on Mardi Gras in 1778. Although the two men were reconciled in 1779, the marriage did not turn out to be a happy one, and in 1780 the couple separated. Louis never remarried.

Shortly afterwards, Louis Henri began a public affair with the Paris Opera singer Marguerite “Mimi” Michelot, which resulted in two illegitimate daughters, one of whom, Adèle, went on to marry the Comte de Reuilly. During the French Revolution, Louis Henri accompanied his father into exile in England and survived the purge of the House of Bourbon in France, which cost the lives of King Louis XVI and his wife Queen Marie Antoinette, amongst others.

In 1804, his son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, was abducted in Germany by order of Napoleon and executed in the moat of the Château de Vincennes on trumped-up charges of treason. The Duke of Enghien had been married to Charlotte Louise de Rohan for less than two months and had no issue.

Louis Henri returned with his father to France after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, and both recovered their fortunes and public status. On his father&#x27;s death in 1818, he assumed the title of Prince of Condé.

== Restoration ==
During the 1814 restoration, the Prince, as Duke of Bourbon, became the namesake for the 8th Bourbon Light Horse Regiment (&quot;8ème Régiment de Chasseurs à Cheval de Bourbon&quot;). However, following Napoleon&#x27;s return in March 1815, the regiment joined Napoleon and he emigrated to Belgium. Within the Infantry Corps, the Prince was made Colonel General of the Light Infantry and consequently became the namesake for the Bourbon Line Infantry Regiment which was formed by the merger of the 9th Line Infantry Regiment (&quot;9ème Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;) and the 2nd &amp; 7th Battalions of the 37th Light Infantry Regiment (&quot;37ème Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie Légère&quot;). This regiment also joined Napoleon after his return from Elba in March 1815.

==End of the Condé==

While in exile in 1811, the duc de Bourbon had made the acquaintance at a bordello in Piccadilly of Sophia Dawes or Daw, a maid in a brothel from the Isle of Wight. He set the woman and her mother up in London in a house on Gloucester Street. There, she went through an extensive educational program.

After the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, Louis Henri brought her to Paris and arranged a marriage for her to Baron Adrien Victor de Feucheres, an officer in the royal guard. This was done to allow Sophia’s entry into French society. However, in the course of setting up her marriage license, Sophia lied on several particulars. Feucheres, who became an aide to the duke, believed for several years that Sophia was a natural daughter of Louis Henri II. When he discovered the truth, he separated from his wife, and informed King Louis XVIII of the real relationship between Louis Henri and Sophia. The king banned Sophia from court.

In revenge, Sophia approached the head of the House of Orléans, the Duke of Orleans, and through him made a new entry into society. In return, she agreed to use her influence on the aging Louis Henri II to have him set up a will making the son of Louis Philippe, Prince Henri, Duke of Aumale, the old prince&#x27;s main heir. Sophia was given two million francs for her services in the matter. The new Bourbon king, Charles X, eventually accepted her back at court. She was again considered acceptable by polite French society. She was even able to arrange the marriage of a niece to a nephew of Talleyrand.

By now, Louis Henri was trying to get away from the mistress who had taken over his life. In the summer of 1830, he returned to his home at St. Leu. There, he heard of the July Revolution. Sophia immediately set about to get him to recognize the new Orléans monarchy. 

On 27 August 1830, Louis Henri was found dead with a rope around his neck but his feet on the ground; while there were initially suspicions of foul play, with the baroness being implicated, an inquiry was held which formally declared his death to be a suicide. There were rumours that the new King of the French, Louis-Philippe, had collaborated with Sophia in the crime, as they feared that she and Louis Phillippe&#x27;s son Aumale – the testamentary heirs of Condé – might be disinherited by the Prince after a possible flight abroad. Later, rumours circulated amongst the nobility that Condé had died pleasuring himself, engaged in what would later be known as autoerotic asphyxiation. Since there was insufficient evidence to prove that he had been murdered, the baroness was not prosecuted, although she was involved in litigation regarding the inheritance for years to come.

There are some aspects of the relationship between Sophia and the Prince which may have inspired William Thackeray&#x27;s novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, specifically concerning the character Becky Sharp and her possible involvement in the death of Joseph Sedley. With Louis Henri&#x27;s death the line of Bourbon-Condé came to an end; his lands and wealth passed to his godson, the Duke of Aumale. His father, Louis Philippe, was the feudal-law heir to Conti and Condé, being the grandson of Louise Henriette de Bourbon, a daughter of Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon, who was sister of Louis Henri II&#x27;s grandfather.

<text>Microsoft WebMatrix is a discontinued cloud-connected website builder and HTML editor for Windows, geared towards web development. WebMatrix enables developers to build websites using built-in templates or popular open-source applications, with full support for ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js and HTML5. Microsoft developed WebMatrix for the purpose of providing web developers with coding, customization, and publishing capabilities all in one place.

==History==
WebMatrix is a successor of ASP.NET Web Matrix, which was released in 2003 and later discontinued.

In 2011, WebMatrix was released to support the large number of open source content management systems and to provide a lightweight web development environment for PHP and the new, simplified ASP.NET web pages. It focused on a clean, simple user interface allowing web developers to build websites from scratch or by customizing open-source web content management systems such as Orchard, DotNetNuke, Umbraco, Joomla!, Drupal and WordPress.

From 2011 to 2012, WebMatrix 2 Beta and RC releases added support for Node.js, mobile simulators, additional website templates, and support publishing to Microsoft Azure web sites. On September 6, 2012, the official release of WebMatrix 2 went public. The release of WebMatrix 3 was made available on May 1, 2013. Unlike WebMatrix 2, WebMatrix 3 requires Windows 7 or later.

In 2016, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of WebMatrix in favour of Visual Studio Code with formal support ending on November 1, 2017.

<text>John MacDonald Badham (born August 25, 1939) is an American film and television director, best known for directing the films &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), &quot;Dracula&quot; (1979), &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983), &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), &quot;Short Circuit&quot; (1986), &quot;Stakeout&quot; (1987), &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; (1990), &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (1991) and &quot;Point of No Return&quot; (1993). He is a two-time Primetime Emmy Award nominee, a two-time Hugo Award nominee, and a Saturn Award winner. He is also a Professor at Chapman University.

==Early life and education==
Badham was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, England, the son of U.S. Army General Henry Lee Badham Jr., and English-born actress Mary Iola Badham (née Hewitt). Henry, a native of Birmingham, Alabama, moved his family back to the U.S. when John was two years old. John&#x27;s parents and paternal grandparents are buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Birmingham. Henry was an aviator in both World Wars, and was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame in 2007. After retirement from the U.S. Air Force as a brigadier general, Henry became a businessman and helped develop the Ensley and Bessemer regions near Birmingham. This same line of business had brought his own father, John&#x27;s grandfather, into association with Walker Percy, grandfather of writer Walker Percy.

After World War II, Badham&#x27;s family settled in Mountain Brook, an affluent suburb of Birmingham. He attended Indian Springs School, at that time a brand-new, liberal boys&#x27; school located a short distance south of Birmingham in Shelby County near the rural post office of Helena. He later went to college at Yale University, earning a Masters of Fine Arts.

==Career==
Badham worked in television for years, on Universal Television series like &quot;Cannon&quot; and &quot;The Bold Ones&quot;. He then directed several acclaimed TV movies, including &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Shocking?&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Law&quot; (1974). His first feature film was &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot; in 1976.

His breakthrough came in 1977 when he replaced John G. Avildsen as the director of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, a massive worldwide hit starring John Travolta. His choices after that film were wildly eclectic, ranging from the action thriller &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983) to the comedy-drama &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot; (1981) to the comedy thriller &quot;Stakeout&quot; (1987) and its sequel &quot;Another Stakeout&quot; (1993). &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), starring Matthew Broderick, is his other signature film, renowned for its take on popular Cold War fears of nuclear terror as well as being one of the first films to deal with the subculture of amateur hacking. Another sizable hit was &quot;Short Circuit&quot; (1986), a comedy about a robot who comes to life.

In addition to his numerous film credits, Badham has also continued to direct and produce for TV, including credits for Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, the A&amp;E television series &quot;The Beast&quot;, TV movies like HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Jack Bull&quot; (1999), and episodes of series including &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;.He has also contributed commentary to the web series &quot;Trailers from Hell&quot;.

In 1986, he signed a two-year development deal with production company Universal Pictures, in order to develop various film projects. Badham is a Professor at Chapman University.

===Unrealized projects===
Badham has been considered to direct films that ended up being directed by others, such as &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), &quot;Brubaker&quot; (1980), &quot;First Blood&quot; (1982), &quot;Staying Alive&quot; (1983),&quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983),&quot;Starman&quot; (1984), &quot;Project X&quot; (1987),&quot;Short Circuit 2&quot; (1988),&quot;Ghost Dad&quot; (1990),&quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992),&quot;The Firm&quot; (1993) and &quot;Dragonheart&quot; (1996).

==Personal life==
Badham&#x27;s sister, Mary Badham, was nominated for an Oscar for her role as &quot;Scout&quot; Finch in the film &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. They worked together on one project, William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Uncle&quot;, released in 1966, Badham was Castle&#x27;s casting director, and Mary played one of the leads.

Badham&#x27;s former wife is retired model Jan Speck of &quot;The New Treasure Hunt&quot;. She had assorted cameo roles in many of his projects, starting in the 1980s.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Winston (June 17, 1746 – April 21, 1815) was an American pioneer, politician and American Revolutionary War hero from Surry County, North Carolina, and the first cousin of statesman and Virginia governor Patrick Henry. He also served in the United States House of Representatives and North Carolina Senate. In 1766, Winston moved to the northern part of Rowan County, North Carolina, the area which subsequently became the current Stokes County, North Carolina.

==Early life==
Joseph Winston was born on June 17, 1746, in Louisa County in the Colony of Virginia. His ancestors emigrated to the American colonies from Yorkshire, England, in the 17th century. His father was Samuel Winston. In his youth, he fought with the Virginia militia against border Indians in 1763 before moving to the Province of North Carolina in the late 1760s. He settled on the Town Fork of the Dan River in what was Surry County and later became Stokes County, North Carolina.

==Career==
Before the war, he was elected a delegate to the North Carolina Provincial Congress in Hillsborough. He was a member of the Surry County Committee of Safety. In 1775, he was selected as a delegate from Surry County to the North Carolina Provincial Congress in Halifax in April 1776. He was the entry taker (register of deeds) for Surry County in 1778, where he assisted the Moravians in their Wachovia settlement.

During the American Revolutionary War, he was a 2nd major and 1st major in the Surry County Regiment of the North Carolina militia, leading a unit of riflemen in several important battles, including the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge, Battle of Kings Mountain and the Battle of Guilford Court House.

Winston later represented North Carolina as a U.S. Congressman and also served in the North Carolina Senate (1787-1789).

Winston owned slaves.

==Death==

He is buried in the National Park at the site of the Battle of Guilford Court House, where a monument erected in 1893 notes Major Winston&#x27;s command of the militia forces. The town of Winston, North Carolina (which later became part of Winston-Salem), is named for him.

<doc id="703487" wikidata="Q862136" url="?curid=703487" title="Bill Gradison">
<text>Willis David &quot;Bill&quot; Gradison Jr. (born December 28, 1928) is an American politician from Ohio who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1993.

==Early life and education==
Gradison, a Republican, was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended Walnut Hills High School and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1949, a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Business Administration in 1951, and a doctor of commercial science degree from the Harvard Business School in 1954.

==Career in banking and politics==
Gradison worked as an investment broker and then served as assistant to the undersecretary of the treasury (1953–1955), and assistant to the secretary of health, education, and welfare (1955–1957).

He was then elected to the Cincinnati city council, on which he served from 1961 to 1974. This service included a term as mayor of Cincinnati in 1971 (a position that at the time rotated among council members). Gradison was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974 and began serving in 1975 (94th Congress). He was the first Jewish Representative elected to the U.S. Congress from Ohio. He began representing Ohio&#x27;s 1st district, but after the 1980 census, he and Tom Luken effectively switched districts, with Gradison&#x27;s district renumbered as the 2nd district. He served until 1993, when he resigned to accept the position of president of the Health Insurance Association of America.

==1980s tax legislation==

The 1981, 1984, and 1986 tax acts and the 1983 Social Security Act were some of the most important legislation initiated by the Ways and Means Committee during the 1980s.

===Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981===
In Congress, Bill was a member of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, during the 95th through the 101st U.S. Congress, and was closely involved in many successful legislative efforts. One effort was the original sponsorship of the bill providing the income tax indexing clause that was later inserted into President Reagan&#x27;s famous tax reduction bill of 1981, called The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. This indexing made it so that income tax brackets would automatically be moved up as the inflation rate rose, so that &quot;bracket creep&quot; would be avoided, whereby income tax rates rise only because of inflation, not because of a rise in deflated income levels. This addition to the 1981 tax bill was very popular, as indicated by its co-sponsorship by a majority of members of the U.S. House of Representatives (sponsorship by a majority of members indicates the bill would be passed if put up for a vote on the House floor).

Indexing of taxes became a part of a substitute tax bill, backed by President Reagan in a July 27, 1981 evening address to the nation, and known as the Conable-Hance Substitute Tax Bill, H.R. 4260. Instead of the one year tax cut bill sponsored by Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, or the two-year tax cut bill sponsored by the Senate Finance Committee Chair Bob Dole, the substitute bill was a three-year 25 percent tax cut, with federal estate tax relief and the indexing of tax rates to prevent bracket creep beginning in 1985. And this substitute bill became The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. It was followed by years of widespread tax elusion efforts which eventually triggered legislative countermeasures.

=== Social Security Reform Act of 1983 ===
Gradison also served as ranking Republican of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security during the Social Security system reform of the early 1980s, and in particular when the Social Security Reform Act of 1983 was passed into law. Included in the 1983 reform act were provisions that Gradison had originated as U.S. Bills. One such provision mandated the computerization of the death certificates of Social Security beneficiaries in order to avoid fraudulent continued payment of benefits when the beneficiary was already deceased. And another such provision included in the 1983 reform act, which was first introduced by Gradison as a U.S. House Bill, was to place the Social Security Trust Funds &quot;off-budget&quot;, out of the general Treasury revenue budget, in order to avoid politicizing the reform process of the Social Security system.

===Tax Reform Act of 1984===
Bill Gradison was also involved in the next major tax reform effort, of 1984. He sponsored a bill that clarified how non-statutory fringe benefits should be treated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in terms of how the IRS should issue regulations on fringe benefits. At the time this was so controversial that Congress had initiated several consecutive moratoriums on the IRS that prohibited them from issuing such fringe benefit regulations. This Congressional clarification of what non-statutory fringe benefits should be taxed, through regulations written by the IRS, was passed into law as a major part of The Tax Reform Act of 1984. It included measures such as the granting of specific tax exemptions for many commonly used fringe benefits.

===Tax Reform Act of 1986===
Gradison was also involved in parts of the 1986 tax reform legislation. He requested a study by the Joint Committee on Taxation on how far corporate tax rates could be reduced, in a revenue neutral fashion, if the 10% investment tax credit were eliminated. They reported that the top corporate tax rate could fall from 46% to 39%, while eliminating the investment tax credit, and still keep total revenue unchanged. This elimination of the 10% investment tax credit was then included in both the House and Senate versions of the bills that became the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reduced top corporate tax rates to 34%.

==Positions after Congress==
The vacancy in the House of Representatives created by Gradison&#x27;s 1993 resignation was filled by a special election, which was won by fellow Republican Rob Portman.

In 2002, Gradison was appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a founding Member of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB); this Board was created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Gradison was unanimously reappointed to a full five-year term in August 2004, and served as Acting Chairman from December 2005 to July 2006. He remained a PCAOB Board member until February 2011. He was named commissioner of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which is an independent Congressional agency established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) to advise the U.S. Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. He served as a MedPAC commissioner for six years. MedPAC&#x27;s biography of Gradison cites his previous experience as a member of the Health Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means; his Vice Chairmanship of the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care (“Pepper Commission”); his service as Assistant to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare; and his Vice Chairmanship of the Commonwealth Fund Task Force on Academic Health Centers.

As of 2022, he serves on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

<text>Noel Scott Engel (January 9, 1943 – March 22, 2019), better known by his stage name Scott Walker, was an American-British singer-songwriter and record producer who resided in England. Walker was known for his emotive voice and his unorthodox stylistic path which took him from being a teen pop icon in the 1960s to an avant-garde musician from the 1980s to his death. Walker&#x27;s success was largely in the United Kingdom, where he achieved fame as a member of pop trio the Walker Brothers, who scored several hit singles, including two number ones, during the mid-1960s, while his first four solo albums reached the top ten during the later part of the decade, with the second, &quot;Scott 2&quot;, reaching number one in 1968. He lived in the UK from 1965 onward and became a UK citizen in 1970.

After the Walker Brothers split in 1967, he began a solo career with the album &quot;Scott&quot; later that year, moving toward an increasingly challenging style on late-1960s baroque pop albums such as &quot;Scott 3&quot; and &quot;Scott 4&quot; (both 1969). After sales of his solo work started to decrease, he reunited with the Walker Brothers in the mid-1970s. The reformed band achieved a top ten single with &quot;No Regrets&quot; in 1975, while their last album &quot;Nite Flights&quot; (1978) marked the beginning of Walker taking his music in a more avant-garde direction. After a few years hiatus, Walker revived his solo career in the mid-1980s, progressing his work further towards the avant-garde; of this period in his career, &quot;The Guardian&quot; said &quot;imagine Andy Williams reinventing himself as Stockhausen&quot;. Walker&#x27;s 1960s recordings were highly regarded by the 1980s UK underground music scene, and gained a cult following.

Walker continued to record until 2018. He was described by the BBC upon his death as &quot;one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in rock history&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Noel Scott Engel was born on January 9, 1943, in Hamilton, Ohio in the Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan area, the son of Elizabeth Marie (Fortier), who was from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Noel Walter Engel. His father was an oil industry manager whose work led the family to successive homes in Ohio, Texas, Colorado, and New York. Engel and his mother settled in California in 1959. Engel was interested in both music and performance and spent time as a child actor and singer in the mid to late 1950s, including roles in two Broadway musicals, &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; and &quot;Plain and Fancy&quot;. Championed by singer and TV host Eddie Fisher, he appeared several times on Fisher&#x27;s TV program. Engel cut some records including one named &quot;Misery&quot;, which saw him briefly promoted as a teen idol.

Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Engel had already changed both his taste and his direction. Interested in the progressive jazz of Stan Kenton and Bill Evans, he was also a self-confessed &quot;Continental suit-wearing natural enemy of the Californian surfer&quot; and a fan of European cinema (in particular Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, and Robert Bresson) and the Beat poets. In between attending art school and furthering his interests in cinema and literature, Scott played bass guitar proficiently enough to get session work in Los Angeles as a teenager.

In 1961, after playing with the Routers, he met guitarist and singer John Maus, who was using the stage name John Walker on a fake ID to enable him to perform in clubs while under age. The two formed a band, Judy and the Gents, to back John Walker&#x27;s sister Judy Maus, before joining other musicians to tour as the Surfaris (although they did not play on the Surfaris&#x27; records). In early 1964, Engel and John Walker began working together as the Walker Brothers, later in the year linking up with drummer Gary Leeds whose father financed the trio&#x27;s first trip to the UK.

===1964–1967: The Walker Brothers===

As a trio, the Walker Brothers cultivated a glossy-haired and handsome familial image. Prompted by Maus, each of the members took &quot;Walker&quot; as their stage surname. Scott continued to use the name Walker thereafter, with the brief exception of returning to his birth name for the original release of his fifth solo album &quot;Scott 4&quot;, and in songwriting credits. Initially, John served as guitarist and main lead singer of the trio, with Gary on drums and Scott playing bass guitar and mostly singing harmony vocals. By early 1965, the group had made appearances on TV shows &quot;Hollywood A Go-Go&quot; and &quot;Shindig&quot; and had made initial recordings, but the start of their real success lay in the future and overseas.

While working as a session drummer, Leeds had recently toured the United Kingdom with P.J. Proby and persuaded both John and Scott to try their luck with him on the British pop scene. The Walker Brothers arrived in London in early 1965. Their first single, &quot;Pretty Girls Everywhere&quot; (with John still as lead singer), failed to chart. Their next single, &quot;Love Her&quot; – with Scott&#x27;s deeper baritone in the lead – made the UK Top 20 and he became the group&#x27;s main singer from this point on.

The Walker Brothers&#x27; next single, &quot;Make It Easy on Yourself&quot;, a Bacharach/David ballad, went to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart (No. 16 on the U.S. charts) on release in August 1965. After hitting again with &quot;My Ship Is Coming In&quot; (No. 3 UK), their second No. 1 (No. 13 U.S.), &quot;The Sun Ain&#x27;t Gonna Shine Any More&quot;, shot to the top in early 1966; shortly thereafter their fan club grew to contain more members than the official fan club of the Beatles. Although this is no indication that their actual fan base was larger than that of the Beatles, the Walker Brothers—especially lead singer Scott—attained pop star status.

Between 1965 and 1967, the group released three albums, &quot;Take It Easy with the Walker Brothers&quot; (1965), &quot;Portrait&quot; (1966) and &quot;Images&quot; (1967), and two EPs, &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Solo John/Solo Scott&quot; (both 1966). Following &quot;The Sun Ain&#x27;t Gonna Shine Anymore&quot;, the group&#x27;s subsequent singles in 1966 were &quot;(Baby) You Don&#x27;t Have to Tell Me&quot; (No. 13 UK), &quot;Another Tear Falls&quot; (No. 12 UK) and &quot;Deadlier Than the Male&quot; (No. 32 UK), the latter a co-write between Scott and Johnny Franz for the soundtrack of the film of the same name, while 1967 brought two more singles in &quot;Stay With Me Baby&quot; and &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; (both of which reached No. 26 in the UK).

The Walkers&#x27; 1960s sound mixes Phil Spector&#x27;s &quot;wall of sound&quot; techniques with symphonic orchestrations featuring Britain&#x27;s top musicians and arrangers, notably Ivor Raymonde. Scott served as effective co-producer of the band&#x27;s records throughout this period, alongside their named producer Johnny Franz and engineer Peter Oliff. Many of their earlier numbers had a driving beat, but with the release of their third album, &quot;Images,&quot; in 1967 ballads predominated.

By 1967, John Walker&#x27;s musical influence on the Walker Brothers had waned (although on &quot;Images&quot; he sang lead on a cover of &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; and contributed two original compositions), which led to tensions between him and Scott. At the same time, Scott was finding the group a chafing experience: &quot;There was a lot of pressure. I was coming up with all the material for the boys, and I was having to find songs and getting the sessions together. Everyone relied on me, and it just got on top of me. I think I just got irritated with it all.&quot; His desire to shake off his pop pin-up reputation might have influenced his drinking habits. In 1967 he told one British journalist that he was drinking “a bottle of wine and a bottle of Scotch a day” with the sole purpose, he claimed, of wanting to coarsen the baritone voice he thought sounded too sweet.

Artistic differences and the stresses stemming from overwhelming pop stardom led to the break-up of the Walker Brothers in the summer of 1967, although they reunited temporarily for a tour of Japan in 1968.

===1967–1974: Solo work===
For his solo career, Walker shed the Walker Brothers&#x27; mantle and worked in a style clearly glimpsed on &quot;Images&quot;. Initially, this led to a continuation of his previous band&#x27;s success. Walker&#x27;s first four albums, titled &quot;Scott&quot; (1967), &quot;Scott 2&quot; (1968), &quot;Scott 3&quot; (1969), and &quot;&quot; (1969), all sold in large numbers, with &quot;Scott 2&quot; topping the British charts. Walker also achieved two UK Top 20 singles during this period with &quot;Joanna&quot; (1968) and &quot;Lights of Cincinnati&quot; (1969).

During this period, Walker combined his earlier teen appeal with a darker, more idiosyncratic approach (which had been hinted at in songs like &quot;Orpheus&quot; on the &quot;Images&quot; album). While his vocal style remained consistent with the Walker Brothers, he now drove a fine line between classic ballads, Broadway hits and his own compositions, and also included risqué recordings of Jacques Brel songs (translated by Mort Shuman, who was also responsible for the hit musical &quot;Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris&quot;). Walker&#x27;s own original songs of this period were influenced by Brel and Léo Ferré as he explored European musical roots while expressing his own American experience and reaching a new maturity as a recording artist.

Walker continued to grow as a producer. In 1968 (during the brief Walker Brothers reunion and tour of Japan), he produced a single with the Japanese rock group the Carnabeats, featuring Gary Walker on vocals. Upon his return to the UK, he produced a solo album for the Walker Brothers&#x27; musical director and guitarist Terry Smith. In 1968, Walker also produced &quot;Ray Warleigh&#x27;s First Album&quot;. According to Anthony Reynolds, &quot;[Warleigh&#x27;s] album, recorded on December 13 and released in the following year, had little in common with the more esoteric progressive jazz that Scott was digging at the time, and the result veered more toward pleasantly middle-of-the-road muzak than the jazz fusion just around the corner.&quot; In 1968, Scott Walker also produced John Walker&#x27;s solo single &quot;Woman&quot;.

Walker&#x27;s own relationship with fame, and the concentrated attention which it brought to him, remained a problem for his emotional well-being. He became reclusive and increasingly distanced from his audience. In 1968 he threw himself into an intense study of contemporary and classical music, which included a sojourn in Quarr Abbey, a Catholic Benedictine monastery in Ryde on the Isle of Wight, to study Gregorian chant, building on an interest in lieder and classical musical modes.

At the peak of his fame in 1969, Walker was given his own BBC TV series, &quot;Scott&quot;, featuring solo Walker performances of ballads, big band standards, Brel songs, and his own compositions. Archival footage of the show is extremely rare as recordings were not conserved. However, audio selections from the show were released in 2019 as the box set &quot;Live on Air 1968-1969&quot;. In later interviews Walker has suggested that by the time of &quot;Scott 3&quot;, his first album to be dominated by his own songwriting, a self-indulgent complacency had crept into his choice of material. His next album, &quot;&quot;, featured no original material and exemplified the problems he was having in failing to balance his own creative desires with the demands of the entertainment industry and of his manager Maurice King, who seemed determined to mould his protégé into a new Andy Williams or Frank Sinatra. Despite the failure of the &quot;Scott&quot; TV show, the aforementioned companion LP was a commercial success, reaching the top 10 of the UK Albums Chart - Walker&#x27;s last album to do so. Around this time, Walker also recorded the title song for the French/Italian film &quot;Une Corde, Un Colt&quot; (&quot;The Rope and the Colt&quot; in English), and in 1970 he recorded &quot;I Still See You&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Go-Between&quot;.

Having parted company with King, Walker released his fifth solo LP – &quot;Scott 4&quot; – at the end of 1969. Compensating for the previous all-covers album, this was his first album to be made up entirely of self-penned material. It has been speculated that Walker&#x27;s decision to release &quot;Scott 4&quot; under his birth name of Scott Engel contributed to its chart failure. All subsequent re-issues of the album have been released under his stage name. As Sean O&#x27;Hagan wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Now recognised as one of his greatest recordings, it sold poorly. The world was not ready for the existentialist musings of a pop singer whose touchstones were the films of Kurosawa and Bergman and the novels of Kafka and Camus.&quot;

Walker then entered a period of self-confessed artistic decline, during which he spent five years making records &quot;by rote, just to get out of contract&quot; and consoling himself with drink. His next album, &quot;&#x27;Til the Band Comes In&quot; (1970), showed a pronounced split between its two sides. Side A featured original material (mostly co-written with new manager Ady Semel) while side B consisted almost entirely of cover versions. Subsequent releases saw Walker revert to cover versions of popular film tunes, easy listening standards and a serious flirtation with country music. All of his next four albums - &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; (1972), &quot;Any Day Now&quot; (1973), &quot;Stretch&quot; (1973), and &quot;We Had It All&quot; (1974) - feature no original material whatsoever. Walker would later prevent these four albums, and the 1969 &quot;&quot; album, from being released on CD. The last two did receive a CD release by independent label BGO Records in the late 1990s, though without Walker&#x27;s own approval.

In the 2006 documentary &quot;Scott Walker: 30 Century Man&quot;, Walker describes these as his &quot;lost years&quot; in terms of creativity. He has also confessed to having surrendered his direction due to outside pressure: 

=== 1975–1978: The Walker Brothers reunite ===
By the mid-1970s, Walker&#x27;s career was at its nadir, and he joined back up with John Maus and Gary Leeds to revive the Walker Brothers in 1975. Their first comeback single, a cover of Tom Rush&#x27;s song &quot;No Regrets&quot;, from the album of the same title reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart, some months after its release. However, the parent album peaked at only number 49 in the UK Albums Chart. The two singles from the next album &quot;Lines&quot; (its title track, which Scott regarded as the best single the group ever released, and &quot;We&#x27;re All Alone&quot;) both failed to chart, and the album fared no better. Neither &quot;No Regrets&quot; or &quot;Lines&quot; included any original material by Scott. 

With the imminent demise of their record label, the Walkers collaborated on an album of original material that was in stark contrast to the soft rock/easy listening style of the previous two albums. The resulting album, &quot;Nite Flights&quot;, was released in 1978 with each of the Brothers writing and singing their own compositions (the opening four songs by Scott, the middle two by Gary and the final four by John). Scott&#x27;s four songs – &quot;Shut Out&quot;, &quot;Fat Mama Kick&quot;, &quot;Nite Flights&quot; and &quot;The Electrician&quot; – were his first original compositions since &quot;&#x27;Til the Band Comes In&quot; and represented his first steps away from the MOR image and sound he had cultivated since the commercial failure of &quot;Scott 4&quot;. The extremely dark and discomforting sound of Scott&#x27;s songs, particularly &quot;The Electrician&quot;, was to prove a forerunner to the direction of his future solo work.

In spite of a warm critical reception (with Scott&#x27;s contributions particularly lauded), sales figures for &quot;Nite Flights&quot; were ultimately as poor as those of &quot;Lines&quot;. The supporting tour saw the band concentrating on the old hits and ballads and ignoring the songs from their new record. Apparently now fated for a stagnant career on the revival circuit, the Walker Brothers lost heart and interest, compounded by Scott&#x27;s increasing reluctance to sing live. By the end of 1978, now without a record deal, the group drifted apart again and Scott Walker entered a three-year period of obscurity and no releases.

===1979–1995: Return to solo career===
In 1981, interest in Scott Walker&#x27;s work was stimulated by the compilation &quot;Fire Escape in the Sky: The Godlike Genius of Scott Walker&quot;, containing tracks selected by Julian Cope, which reached number 14 on the UK Independent Chart. Building on the critical and sales momentum of the compilation, Walker subsequently signed with Virgin Records.

In 1984, Walker released his first solo album in ten years, &quot;Climate of Hunter&quot;. The album furthered the complex and unnerving approach Walker had established on &quot;Nite Flights&quot;. While based loosely within the field of 1980s rock music, and featuring guest appearances by contemporary stars Billy Ocean and Mark Knopfler, it had a fragmented and trance-like approach. Many of the eight songs lacked either titles (&quot;Track Three&quot;, &quot;Track Five&quot; etc.) or easily identifiable melody, with only Walker&#x27;s sonorous voice as the link to previous work. Like &quot;Nite Flights&quot; before it, &quot;Climate of Hunter&quot; was met with critical praise but low sales. Plans to tour were made but never came to fruition. A second album for Virgin was begun in 1985, with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois producing and Robert Fripp on guitar, but was abandoned after early sessions. Soon afterwards, Walker was dropped by the label.

Walker spent the late 1980s away from music, with only a brief cameo appearance in a 1987 Britvic TV advert (alongside other 1960s pop icons) to maintain his profile. He did not return to public attention until the early 1990s when his solo and Walker Brothers work was critically reappraised again. During 1991 and 1992, Walker&#x27;s first four solo albums (not counting &quot;TV Series&quot;) were issued on CD for the first time and the compilation album &quot;No Regrets – The Best of Scott Walker and The Walker Brothers 1965–1976&quot; hit number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;&#x27;Til the Band Comes In&quot; and all of the Walker Brothers&#x27; albums would also see CD release later in the 1990s. Walker&#x27;s own return to current active work was gradual and cautious. In 1992 he co-wrote and co-performed (with Goran Bregović) the single &quot;Man From Reno&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Toxic Affair&quot;. Having signed to Fontana Records, he began work on a new album. In the meantime David Bowie covered Scott&#x27;s song &quot;Nite Flights&quot; on his &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; album, which also contained the Walker inspired &#x27;You&#x27;ve Been Around&#x27;.

&quot;Tilt&quot;, Walker&#x27;s first album for eleven years, was released in 1995, developing and expanding the working methods explored on &quot;Climate of Hunter&quot;. Variously described as &quot;an anti-matter collision of rock and modern classical music&quot;, as &quot;Samuel Beckett at La Scala&quot; and as &quot;indescribably barren and unutterably bleak... the wind that buffets the gothic cathedrals of everyone&#x27;s favorite nightmares&quot;, it was more consciously avant-garde than its predecessor with Walker now revealed as a fully-fledged modernist composer. Although Walker was backed by a full orchestra again, this time he was also accompanied by alarming percussion and industrial effects; and while album opener &quot;Farmer in the City&quot; was a melodic piece, albeit a very dark one, the remaining pieces were harsh and demandingly avant-garde.

Lyrically, subject matter included the life and murder of Pier Paolo Pasolini (and his relationship with Ninetto Davoli), cockfighting, the Holocaust, the First Gulf War, a conflation of the trials of Adolf Eichmann and Caroline of Brunswick, and a man talking to the corpse of Che Guevara.

===1996–2005: Interim work===
In 1996, Walker recorded the Bob Dylan song &quot;I Threw It All Away&quot; under the direction of Nick Cave for inclusion in the soundtrack for the film &quot;To Have and to Hold&quot;. In 1998, in a rare return to straightforward balladeering, he recorded the David Arnold song &quot;Only Myself to Blame&quot; (for the soundtrack of the Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;) and also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the Léos Carax film &quot;Pola X&quot;, which was released as an album. In 1999, he wrote and produced two songs - &quot;Scope J&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; - for Ute Lemper on her album &quot;Punishing Kiss&quot;. &quot;Lullaby&quot; is only available as a bonus track on the Japanese version of the CD.

In 2000, Walker curated the London South Bank Centre&#x27;s annual summer live music festival, Meltdown, which has a tradition of celebrity curators. He did not perform at Meltdown himself, but wrote the music for the Richard Alston Dance Project item &quot;Thimblerigging&quot;. The following year he served as producer on Pulp&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;We Love Life&quot; (whose track &quot;Bad Cover Version&quot; includes a mocking reference to the poor quality of &quot;the second side of &quot;&#x27;Til The Band Comes In&quot;&quot;).

In October 2003, Walker was given an award for his contribution to music by &quot;Q&quot; magazine, presented by Jarvis Cocker of Pulp. Walker received a standing ovation at the presentation. This award had been presented only twice before, the first time to Phil Spector, and the second to Brian Eno. The release of a retrospective box set, &quot;5 Easy Pieces&quot;, comprising five themed discs spanning Walker&#x27;s work with the Walker Brothers, his solo career (including film soundtrack work), and the two pieces composed for Ute Lemper, followed soon after.
The British independent label 4AD Records signed Walker in early 2004.

===2006–2019: Later years===
On May 8, 2006, Scott Walker released &quot;The Drift&quot;, his first album in eleven years (the same amount of time that separated his previous two albums &quot;Climate of Hunter&quot; and &quot;Tilt&quot;). Critical acclaim for the album garnered a Metacritic score of 85.

In both composition and atmosphere, &quot;The Drift&quot; was a continuation of the surreal, menacing, partially abstract approach displayed on &quot;Tilt&quot;. It featured jarring contrasts between loud and quiet sections; instrumentation was similar to &quot;Tilt&quot; in the use of rock instruments and a large orchestra, but the album also interpolated unnerving sound effects such as the distressed braying of a donkey, a demoniac Donald Duck impression, and (during a recording sequence captured on film) an orchestral percussionist punching a large cut of raw meat. Lyrical subjects included torture, disease, the relationship and eventual shared death of Mussolini and his mistress Clara Petacci, and a conflation of the 9/11 attacks with a nightmare shared by Elvis Presley and his dead twin brother Jesse. In contemporary interviews, Walker appeared more at ease with media attention, revealing a wish to produce albums more frequently and hinting at significant changes in the nature of his own material if and when it suits him. Although he mentioned the possibility of touring again with a compact, five-piece band in an interview with &quot;The Wire&quot; this never transpired.

In June 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; and radio honored Scott Walker with the MOJO Icon Award: &quot;Voted for by &quot;Mojo&quot; readers and Mojo4music users, the recipient of this award has enjoyed a spectacular career on a global scale&quot;. It was presented by Phil Alexander.
A documentary film, &quot;Scott Walker: 30 Century Man&quot;, was completed in 2006 by filmmaker Stephen Kijak. Interviews were recorded with David Bowie (executive producer of the film), Brian Eno, Radiohead, Sting, Gavin Friday, Jarvis Cocker, Richard Hawley, and many musicians associated with Walker over the years. The World Premiere of &quot;Scott Walker: 30 Century Man&quot; took place as part of the 50th London Film Festival. When &quot;The Independent&quot; released its list of &quot;Ten must-see films&quot; at the 50th London Film Festival, &quot;Scott Walker: 30 Century Man&quot;, was among them. A documentary on Walker containing a substantial amount of footage from the film was shown on BBC1 in May 2007 as part of the &quot;Imagine...&quot; strand, presented by Alan Yentob.

Walker released &quot;Darkness&quot; as part of &quot;Plague Songs&quot;, an album of songs for the &quot;Margate Exodus&quot; project, a re-telling of the Book of Exodus, the story of Moses and his search for the Promised Land. Ten singer-songwriters were commissioned by Artangel to write and record a song inspired by one of the ten biblical plagues. Walker&#x27;s evocation of &quot;Darkness&quot; appears as the ninth.

On September 24, 2007, Walker released &quot;And Who Shall Go to the Ball? And What Shall Go to the Ball?&quot; as a limited, never-to-be-re-pressed edition. The 24-minute instrumental work was performed by the London Sinfonietta with solo cellist Philip Sheppard as music to a performance by London-based CandoCo Dance Company. The recording is currently unavailable. From November 13 to 15, 2008, &quot;Drifting and Tilting: The Songs of Scott Walker&quot; was staged at The Barbican, in London. It comprised eight songs, two from &quot;Tilt&quot; – &quot;Farmer in the City&quot; and &quot;Patriot (a single)&quot; – and the rest from &quot;The Drift&quot;: &quot;Cossacks Are&quot;, &quot;Jesse&quot;, &quot;Clara (Benito&#x27;s Dream)&quot;, &quot;Buzzers&quot;, &quot;Jolson and Jones&quot; and &quot;Cue&quot;. Each song was presented in a music-theatre manner, with the vocal parts taken by a number of singers, including Jarvis Cocker, Damon Albarn and Dot Allison. Walker collaborated with Bat for Lashes on the song &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; from her 2009 album &quot;Two Suns&quot;. He wrote the score for the ROH2 production of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1932 play &quot;Duet for One&quot;, which was staged in the Linbury Studio in June 2011.

Walker&#x27;s final solo album, &quot;Bish Bosch&quot;, was released on December 3, 2012, and was received with generally favourable reviews. In 2014, Walker collaborated with the experimental drone metal duo Sunn O))) on &quot;Soused&quot;, which was released on October 21, 2014. A year later, Walker composed the score for Brady Corbet&#x27;s film &quot;The Childhood of a Leader&quot;; this was followed in 2018 by the score for Corbet&#x27;s film &quot;Vox Lux&quot;, also featuring music by Australian singer-songwriter Sia.

==Collaborations==
As a record producer and guest performer, Walker worked with a number of artists and bands, including Pulp, Ute Lemper, Sunn O))), and Bat for Lashes.

==Personal life==
He was survived by his daughter, Nicola Lee, from his marriage to Mette Teglbjaerg, which ended in divorce, and his granddaughter, Emmi-Lee, who lives with her mother in Denmark.

An only child, Walker was always reclusive and reluctant to discuss his private life. &quot;He suffered depression, drank too much, took too many drugs and, like many of the great musicians of the 1960s, went missing in action&quot;, reported Simon Hattenstone in 2012. &quot;He rarely talks to the media&quot; and &quot;has come across as sombre and taciturn.&quot; When asked, Walker agreed that he had found fame hard to deal with. &quot;Well, I was an intense young guy.&quot;

==Death==
Walker died at the age of 76 in London on March 22, 2019. His death was announced three days later by his record company 4AD, which announced cancer as the cause of death, while calling him &quot;a unique and challenging titan at the forefront of British music&quot; and summarising his career highlights online. Tributes included those from Thom Yorke, Marc Almond and Neil Hannon.

==Artistry and compositional approach==
Initially working as an interpreter of other people&#x27;s songs, Scott Walker had developed his own songwriting skills by the heyday of the Walker Brothers and by the time of his first solo album in 1967. In a 1984 interview he spoke of difficulty in writing songs: &quot;I don&#x27;t write songs for pleasure. I can only write when I have to – like I&#x27;m under contract, or to finish an album.&quot;

Walker&#x27;s late 1960s and 1970s work was relatively conventional. On a superficial level, it followed the melodic orchestral pop template used by singers such as Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams and Jack Jones – mainstream artists whose career path he was initially expected to follow. Crucial differences came via the more avant-garde orchestrations of his arrangers (primarily Angela Morley (at the time known as Wally Stott), Peter Knight and Reg Guest) and by Walker&#x27;s own approach to lyrics, which involved a cinematic mise-en-scene approach once described as &quot;unsettling short stories, all the more creepy for their delicate orchestral backdrop.&quot; As his solo career progressed, Walker began working political themes into his lyrics. Among the first of these was &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Back Again (Dedicated to the Neo-Stalinist Regime)&quot; (from &quot;Scott 4&quot;). Further references came via his dramatisation of the work of a CIA torturer on &quot;The Electrician&quot; (&quot;Nite Flights&quot;).

Walker&#x27;s next artistic development as a songwriter came when he jettisoned his remaining conventional lyrical concerns along with his remaining connections to formal popular song (and, by extension, the easy-listening ballads which he had been famous for). &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Walker as arriving at &quot;the point where he barely needs melody anymore. Instead, there are whirring synthesizers, great orchestral blocks of sound, noises of unknown provenance. Despite the radical alteration of his methods, Walker commented that he did not consider himself a &quot;composer&quot; in the established sense of the term: &quot;I think of myself as a songwriter, but I agree they are maybe not traditional songs. I know what people mean, but what else can you call them?&quot;

Walker described his lyrical technique (assembling short blocks of text containing images that are sometimes seemingly unconnected and disparate from each other) as being similar to &quot;a general, assembling troops on the battlefield.&quot; &quot;The Wire&quot; has noted that the short blocks of white-on-black text presented in the CD insert for &quot;The Drift&quot; is reflective of this. The roots of this compositional technique are apparent as early as the Scott Walker tracks on &quot;Nite Flights&quot; – the lyrics insert for the album clearly feature the technique, albeit with a black text on a white background.

Walker stated in the documentary film &quot;Scott Walker: 30 Century Man&quot; and in numerous interviews that for his entire career he had not listened to any of his own work after completion, either due to exhaustion from the project or self-criticism.

==Legacy==
In 2018, Walker published &quot;Sundog&quot;, a book of selected lyrics. The book is divided into six sections: &quot;The 60s&quot;, &quot;Tilt&quot;, &quot;The Drift&quot;, &quot;Bish Bosch&quot;, &quot;Soused&quot; and &quot;New Songs&quot;. The foreword to the book was written by Irish novelist Eimear McBride.

Many artists have expressed their admiration for Walker or cited him as an influence, including David Bowie, Alex Turner, Marc Almond, Bauhaus, Goldfrapp, Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy, Julian Cope (who compiled the &quot;Fire Escape in the Sky: The Godlike Genius of Scott Walker&quot; compilation in 1981), Jarvis Cocker, Anohni, Thom Yorke and Radiohead, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, and Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth (particularly expressed in their joint project Storm Corrosion), Tim Bowness of No-Man, Leonard Cohen, Efterklang, East India Youth, Kevin Hufnagel, Ihsahn, Russell Mills, Dennis Rea, John Baizley of Baroness and Brian Eno.

<text>Wetering is a hamlet in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, about 9 km southwest of the town of Steenwijk.

It was first mentioned in 1899 as Wetering, and means &quot;discharge canal&quot;. Wetering is a statistical entity, has its own postal code, and has two abandoned churches. Nevertheless it is hamlet probably due to its small population and spread out houses.

<doc id="703501" wikidata="Q505722" url="?curid=703501" title="Mike Turner">
<text>Michael Ray Turner (born January 11, 1960) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative from since 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party. Turner&#x27;s district, numbered as the 3rd district from 2003 to 2013, contains Dayton and Springfield, taking in part of Clark County and all of Montgomery and Greene Counties. He has served on the House Intelligence Committee including as its chair. He was removed as chair by Speaker Johnson. He served as mayor of Dayton, Ohio.

Turner served as the president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly from 2014 to 2016. He is known for his hawkish national security stances.

==Early life, education, and career==
Turner was born in 1960 in Dayton, Ohio, to Vivian and Ray Turner. His mother was a teacher in the Wayne School system in Huber Heights and his father worked as a member of IUE Local 801 for 42 years after serving in the military. Turner was raised in East Dayton and has one sister. He is a non-denominational Protestant Christian.

Turner graduated from Belmont High School in 1978 and received his Bachelor of Arts in political science from the Ohio Northern University in 1982, a Juris Doctor from Case Western Reserve University in 1985, a Master of Business Administration from the University of Dayton in 1992, and a Doctor of Liberal Studies in urban economic development from Georgetown University in 2022. He practiced law with local firms and businesses in the Dayton area before entering politics. He also practiced law during the brief time between his service as mayor of Dayton and as a member of Congress.

==Mayor of Dayton==
Turner was elected mayor of Dayton, Ohio, in 1993, narrowly defeating incumbent Mayor Richard Clay Dixon. Before he took office, the city suffered a number of economic setbacks. Upon taking office, Turner focused on attracting business to the city and on redeveloping vacant and underutilized real estate packages known as brownfields.

During Turner&#x27;s mayoralty, Dayton reached an agreement to construct a baseball stadium for a class A minor league team affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds.

Turner was the mayor of Dayton during the planning and construction of the Schuster Center, which he supported for its contribution to reviving downtown. He facilitated discussions with key leaders from the project&#x27;s conception to its completion. The Schuster Center is a performing arts center at the corner of Second and Main Streets. It has served as a forum for the Victoria Theatre&#x27;s Broadway Series, the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, the Dayton Ballet, and a speaking location for visiting political leaders, such as former New York governor Mario Cuomo.

Turner also started a program called &quot;Rehabarama&quot;, which attracted professionals to historic properties in the city. He was reelected in 1997 over Democratic city commissioner Tony Capizzi. In 2001 he lost to then state senator Rhine McLin, 51.6% to 48.4%.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2002

Turner received 58% of the vote following the retirement of 23-year incumbent Democrat Tony P. Hall from Congress after President George W. Bush named Hall U.N. special envoy for hunger issues. Earlier that year, Turner won the Republican nomination when he defeated Roy Brown with 80% of the vote. Brown was the son and grandson of former area Republican congressmen Bud Brown and Clarence J. Brown and operated a local newspaper company, Brown Publishing. In the general election, Turner defeated Congressman Tony Hall&#x27;s chief of staff, Rick Carne, after Carne won the Democratic nomination. Turner got a substantial assist from the 2000s round of redistricting. The old 3rd had been a fairly compact district centered on Dayton, but redistricting added some Republican-leaning suburbs to the east.

;2004

In 2004, Turner defeated former businesswoman Jane Mitakides with over 62% of the vote. The district was considered a key area in the swing state of Ohio in that year&#x27;s presidential race.

;2006

In 2006, the Democrats planned to target Turner for defeat. Three Democrats entered the Third District primary to run against Turner in the general election. Veterinarian Stephanie Studebaker defeated local bankruptcy attorney David Fierst and recalled Waynesville mayor Charles W. Sanders. Studebaker had previously affiliated with former Vermont governor Howard Dean&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign in Ohio. After winning the nomination, she and her husband Sam were both arrested for domestic violence. Studebaker subsequently dropped out of the race, citing her family concerns and impending legal issues. After her withdrawal, four Democrats entered a special primary to face Turner, won by former assistant United States attorney Richard Chema. Turner defeated Chema with 58% of the vote.

;2008

Jane Mitakides beat Sanders in the Democratic primary and faced Turner in a rematch from 2004. Turner again focused largely on economic issues of job creation and protection for workers affected by the national and regional recession. In a difficult political climate for Republicans, Turner defeated Mitakides with 64% of the vote, his largest margin of victory in any election.

;2010

Turner was challenged by first-time Democratic nominee 25-year-old Joe Roberts in the general election and won with 68% of the vote.

;2012

After redistricting, Turner&#x27;s district was renumbered the 10th district. It absorbed much of the neighboring 7th district, represented by fellow Republican Steve Austria. The district was made significantly more compact than its predecessor, absorbing all of Dayton.

It initially looked like Turner would face Austria in a primary, but Austria dropped out of the race, handing Turner the nomination. Turner then defeated Democratic attorney Sharon Neuhardt with 60% of the vote.

;2020

Turner was challenged in the 2020 Republican primary by Kathi Flanders.

===Tenure===

Turner is a member of the Armed Services and Government Reform committees. In 2009, he was named Ranking Member on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Armed Services.

In January 2003, Turner was appointed to the Armed Services Committee, a position he has used to advocate for the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in his district, and to the Government Reform Committee.

Due to his urban background, focus on the economic redevelopment of cities, and service as Dayton&#x27;s mayor, Turner is sometimes described as an &quot;urban Republican&quot;. Recognizing Turner&#x27;s work on urban development, then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert appointed Turner chair of the Saving America&#x27;s Cities working group. The group was formed to work with the Bush administration to &quot;foster economic development and redevelopment and streamline government services in America&#x27;s cities to help them prosper and grow.&quot;

During the 109th Congress, Turner served on the House Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, in addition to his work on his two other committees, the House Armed Services and Government Reform Committees.

Serving on the Armed Services Committee, Turner advocated for an expansion to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, providing testimony to the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC). This effort proved successful in 2008, when the Air Force announced that 1,000 jobs and over $230 million in federal funding would move to Wright-Patterson AFB. Turner has said that this is the largest single investment in Wright-Patterson since World War II.

In 2006, the Dayton Development Coalition (DDC), a nonprofit and nominally nonpartisan group (though most of the trustees have contributed to Turner&#x27;s campaigns) that advocates for federal funds for economic development in the Miami Valley, began a regional branding campaign. Turner&#x27;s wife&#x27;s company Turner Effect was awarded a contract without competitive bidding to conduct the marketing research associated with the campaign. In April 2008, Turner Effect withdrew from the branding implementation contract after more details of the agreement became public, including details about the more than $300,000 awarded to her company.

The DDC said that its members were &quot;unanimous&quot; in their decision that there was &quot;no conflict [of interest]&quot; in their having chosen Turner&#x27;s company, but watchdog groups and media reports raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest.

In the same year, Turner&#x27;s campaign committee Citizens for Turner contracted with Turner Effect for professional services, such as the production of literature.

On July 7, 2008, Turner wrote an op-ed in the &quot;Hillsboro Times-Gazette&quot; in support of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, referred to as the GI Bill. In May of that year, Turner opposed an earlier version of the GI Bill. Turner has been endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC.

In October 2008, Turner joined then Senator Hillary Clinton, First Lady Laura Bush, Senator Pete Domenici and Representative Brad Miller to announce the introduction of bipartisan legislation that would permanently authorize two historic preservation grant programs. The bill, H.R. 3981, would permanently authorize the programs known as &quot;Save America&#x27;s Treasures&quot;, established by the Clinton administration, and &quot;Preserve America&quot;, established by the Bush administration. It was introduced in the House by Turner and Miller as co-chairs of the Congressional Historic Preservation Caucus and in the Senate by Clinton and Domenici. The two grant programs are complementary. Preserve America supports &quot;community efforts to demonstrate sustainable uses of their historic and cultural sites, focusing on economic and educational opportunities related to heritage tourism.&quot; The Save America&#x27;s Treasures grant program &quot;funds &#x27;bricks-and-mortar&#x27; projects by helping local communities develop sustainable resource management strategies and sound business practices for the continued preservation and use of heritage assets.&quot;

In June 2009, Turner introduced H.J. Res 57, the &quot;Preserving Capitalism in America&quot; amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment, which has 104 cosponsors in the House, would prohibit the United States government from owning any stock in corporations. The amendment did not become law.

In February 2010, Turner released a report on &quot;The Impact of the Housing Crisis on Local Communities and the Federal Response&quot; in conjunction with the Northeast-Midwest Institute and the Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition. The report included testimony and proposals from Dayton community leaders such as Commissioner Dean Lovelace and Miami Valley Fair Housing Center CEO Jim McCarthy, who participated in an August 2009 housing and foreclosure crisis forum in Dayton. Turner indicated he would offer legislation based on the recommendations of the report.

Turner voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and in the coming years repeatedly voted for its repeal. He opposed the &quot;$1 trillion government takeover of our nation&#x27;s health care system&quot; because it would &quot;increase budget deficits and decrease the quality of our health care services&quot;, he said.

Turner was highly critical of the Obama administration&#x27;s Phased Adaptive Approach and Nuclear Posture Review regarding the protection and defense of the U.S. and allies.

In 2012, Turner called for a missile defense site on the east coast of the United States, to defend against missiles launched from Iran. The east coast site would be the third such site, joining two others on the west coast designed to defend against an attack from North Korea.

In 2018, Turner was named to the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. That year, Turner pushed for the establishment of the National Advanced Air Mobility Center of Excellence in Ohio, catalyzing the facility&#x27;s eventual construction at the Springfield–Beckley Municipal Airport.

After the Dayton shooting in August 2019, Turner announced he would back legislation barring the &quot;sale of military-style weapons to civilians&quot; and also said he would support a limit on magazines and the creation of legislation that would keep guns from people deemed dangerous by the police. He had previously &quot;generally backed gun-rights measures during his nine terms in the House&quot;, earning a 93% approval and &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) in prior years. Turner&#x27;s daughter had been across the street from the attack. For the 2020 election the NRA-PVF gave Turner a &quot;D&quot; rating. In 2018 and 2019 he &quot;led the Ohio congressional delegation... in advocating to bring the F-35 program&quot; to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which happened in May 2019. As of May 2019, he was the top Republican on the House Armed Service&#x27;s Strategic Forces Subcommittee. In April 2019, he created a panel to &quot;independently review&quot; the water quality in the Dayton area.

Turner was one of three Ohio Republicans appointed to an Intelligence Committee that examined whether Trump had improperly withheld aid to Ukraine. He stated the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president was &quot;not ok&quot;, but that impeachment was an &quot;assault&quot; on the electorate. On November 19, 2019, Trump praised his questioning of witnesses in the impeachment inquiry in a tweet.

In February 2022, Turner promoted debunked lies about the pleadings John Durham filed as special prosecutor, claiming that they proved that Hillary Clinton &quot;spied&quot; on Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign and on Trump&#x27;s White House. Durham denied in open court that these allegations are a truthful interpretation of his pleadings, but Turner continued to publicly disseminate the allegations.

Following accusations that Donald Trump had kept classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency ended, Turner said on Fox News that he thought the matter was &quot;more like a bookkeeping issue than it is a national security threat&quot;.

On March 18, 2024, Turner indicated that he did not believe Donald Trump had been calling for violence when he used the word &quot;blood bath&quot; in a speech. &quot;The president&#x27;s statements concerning &#x27;blood bath&#x27; were about what would happen in the auto industry if actually the Chinese manufacturers who are coming into Mexico were permitted to import into the United States,&quot; Turner said.

On January 15, 2025, Turner was removed as chair of the House Intelligence Committee by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson ahead of Donald Trump&#x27;s second presidential term. Turner said that Johnson cited &quot;concerns from Mar-a-Lago&quot; when removing him, while Johnson denied to reporters that the removal was a &quot;President Trump decision&quot;.

===Political positions===

==== 2020 election ====
Turner did not join the majority of Republican members of Congress who signed an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election.

Turner voted to certify both Arizona&#x27;s and Pennsylvania&#x27;s results in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.

In June 2020, Turner cosponsored the Holding China Accountable Act, which would restrict visas for Chinese nationals entering the United States to study, work, or attend business meetings in “science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or a related field.”

== Controversies ==
===Allegations of self-enrichment===
In both 2008 and 2010, Turner was listed as one of the &quot;most corrupt members of Congress&quot; by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington for &quot;enrichment of self, family, or friends&quot; and &quot;solicitation of gifts&quot;.

According to analysis conducted by the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; in 2016, when Turner came to Congress in 2002, he reported between $153,026 and $695,000 worth of assets on his financial disclosure form. In 2016, he claimed between $2.8 million and $10.3 million. The paper credited his second marriage to an energy lobbyist as a contributing reason for the increase, since her assets as well as his were listed on his 2016 financial disclosure form. Their relationship raised red flags when Turner was accused of authoring natural gas legislation that might benefit her employer at the time, Cheniere Energy.

===Absence of local town halls===
At multiple times during his tenure in Congress, Turner has faced protests from constituents for refusing to host public town hall events, presumably over fear that the events would draw strong backlash from constituents over Turner&#x27;s repeated efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as Republicans in neighboring districts and around the country had experienced.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Turner married Lori Turner, a health executive. They have two daughters. After 25 years of marriage, they announced their separation in 2012 and divorced in 2013.

Turner married Majida Mourad on December 19, 2015, at Westminster Presbyterian Church in downtown Dayton. Representative Darrell Issa was a groomsman at the wedding. In May 2017, after less than two years of marriage, Turner filed for divorce from Mourad, alleging that Mourad &quot;is guilty of a fraudulent contract&quot;. As part of the acrimonious divorce, Turner&#x27;s lawyers wrote to Issa &quot;stating they would like to depose&quot; him, but lawyers for both sides later released a statement that &quot;Majida Mourad and Congressman Michael Turner have come to a resolution&quot;.

<text>Never Ending Gardens is a division of Dream for Africa, a religious-based non-profit organization based in Gainesville, Georgia, USA, and in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa, that seeks to alleviate hunger in Africa by building sustainable vegetable gardens in communities to improve their diet.

While not a church or denomination, Dream for Africa is focusing on mobilising volunteers from various nations to partner with the people of Africa in achieving enduring breakthroughs related to hunger and food security, orphans and vulnerable children, poverty alleviation through skill enhancement and job creation, and AIDS prevention and care.

The Never Ending Gardens programme makes use of small backyard gardens, allowing for extensive ownership and involvement from the local community, and integrates support programmes to ensure sustainability. The objectives of the programme include hunger alleviation, provision of a nutritional balanced diet, restoration of dignity and respect within the family unit, and general and individual improvement of quality and quantity of life.

The Never Ending Gardens initiative is unlike most food initiatives in that it is not grain-focused, but rather provides vegetables known for their properties of improving the immune-system. The types of vegetables planted were selected in conjunction with the World Health Organization, National Cancer Institute, Micronutrient Initiative, CDC, agricultural agencies and UNAIDS recommendations.

==1st NEG 2004==
&quot;23 April - 2 May Swaziland&quot;

 Benefit to readers 
Swaziland was chosen to be the first implementation of the Never Ending Gardens project owing to its favourable proximity to the organisation’s South African headquarters, its manageable size in terms of population and geographical expanse, available water supply, and the high degree of poverty and HIV/AIDS infection rate.

Additionally, while unable to contribute funds to the project, Swazi officials were open to DFA entering the country and implementing the programme.

Phase one of the three-phase programme ran through the week of April 25–30, 2004, and involved the planting of 12,874 ‘simple gardens’ in 35 locations in the Mafutseni, Ntondozi, Ludzeludze and Mbangave localities. The project implementation team consisted of 122 volunteers from the United States and South Africa who moved through the localities, educating and planting a variety of seedlings. 

The achievements of the group were substantial: 309,000 seedlings were purchased and planted including cabbage, spinach, onions and green peppers. In the seasons to follow, a far wider selection of vegetables will be introduced and rotated.

It is estimated that these gardens will supply immune system-boosting vegetables for over 50,000 individuals. As is well documented, the immune systems of most Africans are very poor, which substantially contributes to the infection rate and the rate of HIV/AIDS deaths.

The first phase showed that more than 85% of all homes did not have any garden of any type in the areas visited. The 70,000 gardens, which the completed initiative is expected to produce, will supply approximately 840,000 vegetables in the first year with 1,728,000 in the second. With an average of 8 people per household, each household would be able to harvest at least 2.5 vegetables a week growing to 5 vegetables per week in the second year.

During 2004, gardens were planted in three countries:

* Swaziland - 20,000 gardens
* Botswana - 20,000 gardens
* South Africa - 60,000 gardens
* Lesotho -

==Planned NEG==

* 2005: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and Ghana
* 2006: Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe and Madagascar
* 2007: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, Central African Republic, Burundi and Rwanda

<text>John Edward McLaughlin (born June 15, 1942) is an American intelligence official who was Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and briefly acting Director of Central Intelligence. He is a Senior Fellow and Distinguished Practitioner-in-Residence at the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University.

==Life and career==

McLaughlin was born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. In 1964, McLaughlin received a bachelor of arts degree from Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. He was a member of the Beta Iota chapter of Delta Sigma Phi. He completed graduate work in comparative politics at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1966 he earned a master of arts degree in international relations from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. After graduating from SAIS, he served as a U.S. Army officer from 1966 to 1969, completing a tour in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. In 2001, he returned to Wittenberg to speak at the commencement ceremony.

McLaughlin&#x27;s CIA career lasted more than 30 years, starting in 1972 with a focus on European, Russian, and Eurasian issues at the Directorate of Intelligence. From 1984 to 1985, he served a rotational tour at the State Department in the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs. He returned to CIA and served as Deputy Director and Director of the Office of European Analysis from 1985 to 1989; Director of Slavic and Eurasian Analysis from 1989 to 1995; Deputy Director for Intelligence, Vice Chairman for Estimates of the National Intelligence Council, and Acting Chairman of the National Intelligence Council from 1995 to 1997; and Deputy Director for Intelligence from 1997 to 2000.

While Deputy Director for Intelligence from 1997 to 2000, he created the Senior Analytic Service, a career track that enables CIA analysts to rise to senior rank without working in management. He also founded the Sherman Kent School for Intelligence Analysis, an institution dedicated to teaching the history, mission, and skills of the analytic profession to new CIA employees.

President Bill Clinton designated McLaughlin as the Acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence on June 28, 2000, and later nominated him for the position. McLaughlin was unanimously confirmed as the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence by the Senate on October 18, 2000. Director of Central Intelligence George J. Tenet swore in McLaughlin as the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence on October 19, 2000.

After Tenet&#x27;s resignation on June 3, 2004, the Bush Administration announced that McLaughlin would serve as Acting Director after Tenet&#x27;s departure on July 11, 2004. McLaughlin himself stepped down as Acting Director on September 24, 2004, after Porter J. Goss was confirmed by the Senate to serve as the new director. He then returned to his position as Deputy Director, and announced his retirement on November 12, 2004.

McLaughlin currently serves as a Senior Fellow and Distinguished Practitioner-in-Residence at the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies at the Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in Washington, D.C. He also serves on the Guiding Coalition of the Project on National Security Reform.

On January 8, 2010, Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair announced that he had appointed McLaughlin to head a group of experts to investigate the December 2009 bombing attempt by alleged terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253, and the November 2009 Fort Hood shooting, carried out by Army Maj. Nidal Hasan. The group was tasked with making proposals to remedy weaknesses in intelligence systems and procedures that the incidents exposed.
In October 2020, McLaughlin signed a letter stating the Biden laptop story “has the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation

<text>The antimins (from the Greek , &quot;Antimension&quot;: &quot;instead of the table&quot;), is one of the most important furnishings of the altar in many Eastern Christian liturgical traditions. It is a rectangular piece of cloth of either linen or silk, typically decorated with representations of the Descent of Christ from the Cross, the Four Evangelists, and inscriptions related to the Passion. A small relic of a martyr is sewn into it. In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, the altar stone serves a similar function. 

== Syriac practice ==
A wooden tablet, the &quot;ţablîtho&quot;, is the liturgical equivalent of the antimins in the churches of Syriac tradition.

<text>Feed or feedmag.com (1995–2001) was one of the earliest online magazines that relied entirely on its original content.

==History==
&quot;Feed&quot; was founded in New York by Stefanie Syman and Steven Johnson in May 1995, with novelist Sam Lipsyte serving as one of its editors.

One of the web&#x27;s earliest general-interest daily publications, &quot;Feed&quot; focused on media, pop culture, technology, science and the arts.

&quot;Feed&quot; soon found a devoted following among an alternative readership and was critically acclaimed, but as a small independent publication, it struggled to raise sufficient advertising revenue.

In July 2000, following a sharp downturn in Internet investment, &quot;Feed&quot; merged with the popular editorial site Suck.com to create Automatic Media. The two sites sought to streamline their operations and collaborate with low staffing costs. Their joint project Plastic.com was founded with only four staffed employees. Despite the faithful cult following and a combined reader base of over 1 million, Automatic Media folded in June 2001, and Feed closed operations.

<doc id="703518" wikidata="Q2442580" url="?curid=703518" title="Tony P. Hall">
<text>Tony Patrick Hall (born January 16, 1942) is an American politician, businessman, and diplomat who served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Ohio&#x27;s 3rd congressional district from 1979 to 2002. Hall had previously served in both chambers of the Ohio General Assembly during the years 1969 to 1979.

From 2002 to 2006, Hall served as United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture, and as chief of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome, which includes the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Subsequently, Hall worked on a Middle East peace initiative in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Presidency.

==Early life and education==
Hall was born in Dayton, Ohio. His father, Dave Hall, served as a Republican mayor of Dayton.

Hall graduated from Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio, in 1960. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Denison University in 1964. While in college, Hall was named Little All-American football tailback and the Ohio Conference&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (1963).

== Career ==
After college, Hall served as Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand, teaching English in 1966 and 1967, an experience that contributed to his strong interest in world hunger issues. He also worked in the real estate business.

===Ohio Legislature===
Hall became active in politics, joining the Democratic Party in a change from his father&#x27;s affiliation. He was elected as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, serving from 1969 to 1973, and as an Ohio state senator from 1973 to 1979.

In 1974, Hall ran for Ohio Secretary of State and lost to Republican incumbent Ted W. Brown.

=== U.S. Representative ===
Hall was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978, to succeed 12-year incumbent Charles W. Whalen Jr., a moderate Republican. He won election with 54 percent of the vote, but would never face another contest anywhere near that close. He would be reelected 11 more times, never dropping below 57 percent of the vote. As a measure of how popular he was in the Dayton area, he was unopposed for reelection in 1984 even as Ronald Reagan carried the district in a landslide. He was unopposed again in 1990, and faced no major-party opposition in 1982 and 2000.

In the 1980s, Hall became an evangelical Christian, prompting him to change his position on abortion from abortion rights to anti-abortion. Otherwise, his voting record was liberal.

During his tenure in Congress, Hall concentrated on seeking to alleviate world hunger. He made frequent trips to more than 100 countries such as Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Sudan, and North Korea where hunger was widespread. He was chairman of the Select Committee on Hunger from 1989 to 1993. When the committee was abolished, Hall fasted for 22 days in protest. He was founder of the Congressional Friends of Human Rights Monitors and the Congressional Hunger Center. Hall served terms on the foreign affairs and small business committees before being appointed to the House Rules Committee in 1981.

Twice during his tenure as U.S. representative, Hall introduced legislation that would have apologized for slavery in the United States.

Hall was an Ohio delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention.

===U.S. Ambassador===
Hall served in the House into 2002, when President George W. Bush nominated him to succeed George McGovern as United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture. Hall&#x27;s confirmation to the post was held up in the Senate for several months, but he was confirmed and sworn into the post in September 2002 by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.

He served in this position until 2006, leading as chief of the United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome, which includes the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Food Programme, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.

===Later career===
With Tom Price, Hall wrote &quot;Changing the Face of Hunger: One Man&#x27;s Story of How Liberals, Conservatives, Democrats, Republicans, and People of Faith Are Joining Forces to Help the Hungry, the Poor, and the Oppressed&quot; (2007).

In March 2007, Hall announced he was committed to fostering a Middle East peace initiative, by working with the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress and religious leaders of the Holy Land, principally among Muslims, Christians and Jews in the Middle East. Under a $1 million grant from U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice via the U.S. Agency for International Development, to be applied to both economics and faith-based efforts, Hall was to work with religious leaders to help prepare the way for peace in the Middle East. Hall received no salary for his work.

He serves as executive director emeritus of The Alliance to End Hunger. Hall also serves on the Board of Advisors of Opportunity International, a charity that seeks to end poverty through microcredit lending to entrepreneurs.

Hall remains active fighting hunger in his hometown of Dayton. In 2015, he created the Hall Hunger Initiative, a Dayton-based nonprofit working to “create a just and equitable food system.&quot;He also served as the Capital Chair for the Gem City Market, a co-op grocery store, and lead a successful effort to raise $5 million.

===Recognition===
Ambassador Hall was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for 1998, 1999 and 2001 for his humanitarian and hunger-related work. For his hunger legislation and for his proposal for a Humanitarian Summit in the Horn of Africa, Ambassador Hall and the Hunger Committee received the 1992 Silver World Food Day Medal from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Ambassador Hall is a recipient of the United States Committee for UNICEF 1995 Children&#x27;s Legislative Advocate Award, U.S. AID Presidential End Hunger Award, 1992 Oxfam America Partners Award, Bread for the World Distinguished Service Against Hunger Award, and NCAA Silver Anniversary Award. He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from Asbury College, Antioch College and Eastern College and a Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Loyola College in Baltimore.

== Personal life ==
Hall and his wife, Janet Sue Dick, were married in 1973. They had two children together, Jyl Hall and Matthew Hall. Matthew died in 1996, at age 15, of leukemia.

<text>Travis Calvin Jackson (November 2, 1903 – July 27, 1987) was an American baseball shortstop. In Major League Baseball (MLB), Jackson played for the New York Giants from 1922 through 1936, winning the 1933 World Series, and representing the Giants in the MLB All-Star Game in 1934. After his retirement as a player, Jackson managed in minor league baseball through to the 1960 season.

Jackson was discovered by Kid Elberfeld at a minor league baseball game at the age of 14. Elberfeld signed Jackson to his first professional contract, and recommended him to John McGraw, manager of the Giants. His exceptional range at shortstop led to the nickname &quot;Stonewall.&quot; Jackson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Waldo, Arkansas, on November 2, 1903. He was the only child of William Jackson, a wholesale grocer, and his wife Etta, who named their son after William B. Travis, a lieutenant colonel who died at the Battle of the Alamo. Jackson&#x27;s father bought him a baseball when he was three years old, and they often played catch together.

Jackson&#x27;s uncle took him to a Little Rock Travelers minor-league game when he was 14 years old. At the game, Jackson&#x27;s uncle introduced him to Kid Elberfeld, telling Elberfeld that his nephew was a talented baseball player. Elberfeld observed Jackson in an impromptu workout, and asked Jackson to contact him when he was ready to begin his professional career.

Jackson attended Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, where he starred on the college baseball team. While there, he injured his knee, and this injury would recur during Jackson&#x27;s career.

==Professional career==

===Playing career===
Following Jackson&#x27;s collegiate career, Elberfeld signed Jackson to his first contract, and he played for Little Rock in 1921 and 1922. Jackson committed 72 errors during the 1922 season, which he considered the &quot;world record for errors&quot;.

Despite this, Elberfeld recommended Jackson to John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants of the National League (NL), who was entitled to a Travelers player as he had lent a player to the team in 1922. McGraw signed Jackson to a contract on June 30, effective at the end of the Southern Association&#x27;s 1922 season.

Jackson debuted with the Giants on September 22, 1922, appearing in three games. With Dave Bancroft and Heinie Groh, the Giants&#x27; starting shortstop and third baseman respectively, sidelined with injuries incurred during the 1923 season, Jackson drew notice as a fill-in. McGraw was confident enough in Jackson&#x27;s abilities to trade Bancroft before the 1924 season, choosing Jackson to be the Giants&#x27; starting shortstop. Though there was doubt that Jackson could adequately replace Bancroft, Jackson played in 151 games during the 1924 season and hit .302 with 11 home runs. The Giants lost the 1924 World Series to the Washington Senators, with Jackson committing a key error in Game 7.

Jackson was considered one of the best shortstops of his era, and he led NL shortstops with a .970 fielding percentage in 1931. However, he missed considerable playing time in his career resulting from injuries and illnesses. Jackson reinjured his knee in 1925, missed significant time during the 1926 season and had surgery for appendicitis during the 1927 season. He missed time with mumps in 1930 and influenza in 1932, and he continued to battle knee problems, missing much of the 1932 and 1933 seasons. Jackson was said to &quot;at 28, already [have] one foot in the minors&quot;. Despite this, manager Bill Terry said that Jackson would &quot;make or break&quot; the 1933 season. Though Jackson fell behind Blondy Ryan on the team&#x27;s depth chart during the season, he returned in the 1933 World Series, which the Giants won over the Senators.
Terry stayed with Jackson as the Giants&#x27; starting shortstop for the 1934 season, in which he drove in 101 runs and was chosen to appear in the 1934 MLB All-Star Game. Jackson played third base in his final two seasons, serving as team captain, although he struggled in the 1936 World Series, which the Giants lost to the New York Yankees. After the season, the Giants requested waivers on Jackson to assign him to the minor leagues.

Jackson batted over .300 six times, including a career-high .339 in the 1930 season, and hit 21 home runs in 1929. He was on four NL pennant-winning teams and a World Series champion (1933). Jackson finished his MLB career with 135 home runs, 929 RBI and a .291 batting average.

===Coaching and managing career===
Jackson signed a three-year contract with the Jersey City Giants of the Class-AA International League after the 1936 season. The team, which the Giants had purchased to become their farm team that offseason, was moved from Albany, New York, with Jackson to serve as player-manager. Jackson&#x27;s knees prevented him from appearing in many games with Jersey City as a player, but he remained as the team&#x27;s manager until July 1938, when he was replaced with Hank DeBerry. The Giants brought Jackson back to the majors as a coach for the remaining 18 months on his contract, succeeding Tommy Clarke, who became a scout.

Jackson missed the next five seasons as he battled tuberculosis, eventually returning to manage in the Boston / Milwaukee Braves system for the Jackson Senators in the Class-B Southeastern League in 1946. Jackson returned to the Giants to coach in 1947 and 1948, receiving his unconditional release following the 1948 season.

Returning to the Braves&#x27; minor league system, Jackson managed the Tampa Smokers of the Class-B Florida International League in 1949, but resigned in July during a losing streak. He managed the Owensboro Oilers of the Class-D Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League in 1950, and began the 1951 season managing the Bluefield Blue-Grays of the Class-D Appalachian League, but was reassigned to the Hartford Chiefs of the Class-A Eastern League when Hartford manager Tommy Holmes was named the Braves&#x27; manager. Jackson managed the Appleton Papermakers of the Class-D Wisconsin State League in 1952 and 1953, the Lawton Braves of the Class-D Sooner State League from 1954 through 1957, the Midland Braves of the Class-D Sophomore League in 1958, the Eau Claire Braves of the Class-C Northern League in 1959 and the Davenport Braves of the Class-D Midwest League in 1960.

==Personal life==
Jackson and his wife, Mary, had two children, Dorothy Fincher and William Travis Jackson, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Jackson died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1987.

==Honors==
As defensive standouts have historically been overshadowed by power hitters in Baseball Hall of Fame voting, Jackson was not elected through the annual balloting process despite his record and achievements. But in 1982, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. He was also inducted in the Arkansas Hall of Fame.

<doc id="703527" wikidata="Q1283961" url="?curid=703527" title="Omophorion">
<text>In the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic liturgical tradition, the omophorion (, meaning &quot;[something] borne on the shoulders&quot;; Slavonic: омофоръ, &quot;omofor&quot;) is the distinguishing vestment of a bishop and the symbol of his spiritual and ecclesiastical authority. Originally woven of wool, it is a band of brocade decorated with four crosses and an eight-pointed star; it is worn about the neck and shoulders. 
By symbolizing the lost sheep that is found and carried on the Good Shepherd&#x27;s shoulders, it signifies the bishop&#x27;s pastoral role as the icon of Christ. All Eastern Orthodox bishops wear the &quot;omophorion.&quot; Clergy and ecclesiastical institutions, including seminaries, subject to a bishop&#x27;s authority are often said to be &quot;under his &quot;omophorion&quot;&quot; (see Ecclesiastical jurisdiction).

The equivalent vestment in Western Christian usage is the archiepiscopal &quot;pallium,&quot; the use of which is subject to different rubrics and restrictions.

==Use==
The &quot;omophorion&quot; has two forms: the ancient great &quot;omophorion&quot;, which passes around the neck, is folded in the front, and hangs down past the knees in both the front and the back, like a loosely worn long scarf; and the small &quot;omophorion&quot; which is much simpler, passing around the neck and hanging down in the front similar to an &quot;epitrachelion&quot; (stole), only wider and shorter, coming down a little past the waist. Because of the complexity of the great &quot;omophorion&quot;, and because of the dignity of the episcopal office, whenever the bishop puts on the &quot;omophorion&quot; or takes it off, he is assisted by two subdeacons.

Whenever the bishop presides at any divine service, he will be vested in the &quot;omophorion&quot;. If he is serving the Divine Liturgy, he will wear both the great and the small &quot;omophorion&quot; at different times over his liturgical vestments. At any service other than the Divine Liturgy, he will usually wear the small &quot;omophorion&quot;.

At the Divine Liturgy, the rubrics call for the bishop to put on and take off the &quot;omophorion&quot; numerous times. When he is first vested, the subdeacons place the great &quot;omophorion&quot; on him, but afterwards, when the rubric calls for him to wear the &quot;omophorion&quot;, it is replaced, for the sake of convenience, with the small &quot;omophorion&quot;. 

In modern practice in the Slavic tradition, when several bishops concelebrate, it is now the custom for the chief celebrant to use the great &quot;omophorion&quot; when called for, and the other bishops to wear the small &quot;omophorion&quot; throughout, with all bishops wearing their mitres. In modern Greek Patriarchal practice, on the other hand, all concelebrating bishops wear the great omophorion at the beginning of the Divine Liturgy, with only the chief celebrant wearing the mitre and the other bishops wearing their kalimavkia with the Epanokalimavkion. In other local Churches, notably the Church of Greece, all concelebrating bishops wear both the great omophorion and the mitre, and even carry their staffs.

In the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, often only the great &quot;omophorion&quot; is used. In this simplified usage, the great &quot;omophorion&quot; is not replaced by the small &quot;omophorion&quot;, and is worn by the bishop throughout the entire liturgy. In such cases, the &quot;omophorion&quot; is often sewn into shape and can be simply draped onto the shoulders rather than wrapped on by assistants. Some Ukrainian Greek Catholic bishops, however, insist on the full ceremonial.

During the All-Night Vigil, the bishop will wear the small &quot;omophorion&quot; at the beginning, but near the end will change into the great &quot;omophorion&quot; for the Great Doxology.

==Development==

In the early church, the &quot;omophorion&quot; was a broad band of white wool ornamented with crosses and draped loosely over the neck, shoulders, and breast. The modern Roman &quot;pallium&quot; developed from this early &quot;omophorion.&quot; In the West, over the centuries, its form has changed into a circular, thin woolen garment for the shoulders, with short, weighted pendants before and behind. The papal &quot;pallium,&quot; originally adopted by Pope Benedict XVI at the beginning of his pontificate, is closer to the original &quot;omophorion&quot;. Pope Benedict XVI later reverted to the original design of the &quot;pallium&quot;, but with red crosses instead of black.

In the East, the only change in the &quot;omophorion&quot; has been an increase in its width and a shift in the material from which it is made. The &quot;omophorion&quot; was documented about the year 400 AD as a liturgical vestment of the bishop in Isidore of Pelusium. It was made of wool and was already seen as symbolic of the duties of bishops as shepherds of their flocks. In the miniatures of an Alexandrian &quot;Chronicle of the World&quot;, written probably during the fifth century, the &quot;omophorion&quot; was represented in an image. In later times, it was shown on the renowned ivory tablet of Trier, depicting the solemn translation of relics. Among the pictures dating from the seventh and eighth centuries, in which the &quot;omophorion&quot; is illustrated, are the lately discovered frescoes in &quot;S. Maria, Antiqua&quot; in the Roman Forum. The representation of the &quot;omophorion&quot; in these frescoes is essentially the same as the vestment in its present form.

The &quot;omophorion&quot; probably developed from the civil &quot;omophorion&quot;, a shoulder garment or shawl in general use. Bishops may have introduced directly by a positive precept a humeral cloth resembling the ordinary &quot;omophorion&quot; and called by that name, to be used as a liturgical pontifical badge. Alternatively, bishops may have used the civil &quot;omophorion&quot; as an ornament without any special significance, but in the course of time it gradually developed associations as a distinctively episcopal ornament. Finally it symbolized an episcopal badge of office.

=== Early omophorion ===
==Oriental Orthodoxy==
In Oriental Orthodoxy, the &quot;omophorion&quot; takes a number of different forms:
* The Armenian Apostolic &quot;emip&#x27;oron&quot; is similar to the Byzantine great &quot;omophorion&quot;.
* The Syriac Orthodox &quot;baţrašil&quot; or &quot;uroro rabbo&quot; (&#x27;great stole&#x27;) is a straight strip of embroidered material, about 20 cm wide, with a head-hole midway along it, that hangs down a bishop&#x27;s chest and back.
* Coptic Orthodox hierarchs (Patriarch, Metropolitans, and bishops) usually wear the &quot;omophorion&quot; folded due to its large width. It is white in colour, with extensive ornamental embroidery. It is wider than its Byzantine counterpart, wrapped over the head over the monastic &quot;kouklion&quot;, then crossed from the front over the chest, wrapped again from the back, crossed over the back by the waist level, then over the shoulders, then coming straight down, tucked under the frontal (over the chest) crossed wrapping. It is called a &quot;Ballin&quot; which is derived from the Greek word &quot;Πάλλιον&quot; (Pallium in Latin) and it is almost double the length of the Byzantine &quot;omophorion&quot;.

<doc id="703539" wikidata="Q152267" url="?curid=703539" title="White Fang">
<text>White Fang is a novel by American author Jack London (1876–1916) about a wild wolfdog&#x27;s journey to domestication in Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. First serialized in &quot;Outing&quot; magazine between May and October 1906, it was published in book form in October 1906. It is a companion novel (and a thematic mirror) to London&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (1903), which is about a kidnapped, domesticated dog embracing his wild ancestry to survive and thrive in the wild.

Much of &quot;White Fang&quot; is written from the viewpoint of the titular canine character, enabling London to explore how animals view their world and how they view humans. &quot;White Fang&quot; examines the violent world of wild animals and the equally violent world of humans. The book also explores complex themes including morality and redemption.

As early as 1925, the story was adapted to film, and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations, including a 1991 film starring Ethan Hawke and a 2018 original film for Netflix.

==Plot summary==
The story begins before the wolf-dog hybrid is born, with two men and their sled dog team on a journey to deliver the coffin of Lord Alfred to a remote town named Fort McGurry in the higher area of the Yukon Territory. The men, Bill and Henry, are stalked by a large pack of starving wolves over the course of several days. Finally, after all of their dogs and Bill have been eaten, more teams find Henry escaping from the wolves; the wolf pack scatters when they hear the large group of people coming.

The story then follows the pack, which has been robbed of its last prey. When the pack finally brings down a moose, the famine is ended; they eventually split up, and the story now follows a she-wolf and her mate, One Eye. One Eye claimed her after defeating and killing a younger rival. The she-wolf gives birth to a litter of five pups by the Mackenzie River, and all but one die from hunger. One Eye is killed by a lynx while trying to rob her den for food for the she-wolf and her pup; his mate later discovers his remains near the lynx&#x27;s den. The surviving pup and the she-wolf are left to fend for themselves. Shortly afterward, the she-wolf kills all the lynx&#x27;s kittens to feed her pup, prompting the lynx to track her down, and a vicious fight breaks out. The she-wolf eventually kills the lynx but suffers severe injury; the lynx carcass is devoured over a period of seven days as the she-wolf recovers from her injuries.

One day, the pup comes across five indigenous people, and the she-wolf comes to his rescue. One man, Grey Beaver, recognizes the she-wolf as his late brother&#x27;s wolfdog, Kiche, who left during a famine. Grey Beaver&#x27;s brother is dead, and so he takes Kiche and her pup and names the cub &quot;White Fang&quot;. White Fang has a harsh life in the native camp; the current puppy pack, seeing him as a wolf, immediately attacks him. The Natives protect him, but the pups never accept him, and the pups&#x27; leader, Lip-Lip, singles him out for persecution. White Fang grows to become a savage, callous, morose, solitary, and deadly fighter, &quot;the enemy of his kind&quot;.

It is at this time that White Fang is separated from his mother, who is sold off to another Native camp by Three Eagles. He earns the respect of Grey Beaver when he saves his son Mit-Sah from a group of boys seeking revenge for White Fang attacking one of them for trying to beat him for no reason. When a famine occurs, he runs away into the woods and encounters his mother Kiche, only for her to chase him away, for she has a new litter of cubs and has forgotten him. He also encounters Lip-Lip, whom he fights and kills before returning to the camp.

When White Fang is five years old, he is taken to Fort Yukon, so that Grey Beaver can trade with the gold-hunters. There, a malicious dog-fighter named &quot;Beauty&quot; Smith connives to get Grey Beaver addicted to whiskey, and then when drunk sell White Fang to him. White Fang defeats all opponents pitted against him, including several wolves and a lynx, until a bulldog called Cherokee is brought in to fight him. Cherokee has the upper hand in the fight when he grips the skin and fur of White Fang&#x27;s neck and begins to throttle him. White Fang nearly suffocates, but is rescued when a rich mining expert, Weedon Scott, stops the fight, and forcibly buys White Fang from Beauty Smith.

Scott attempts to tame White Fang, and after a long, patient effort, he succeeds. When Scott attempts to return to California alone, White Fang pursues him, and Scott decides to take the dog with him back home. In Sierra Vista, White Fang must adjust to the laws of the estate. At the end of the book, an escaped convict, Jim Hall, tries to kill Scott&#x27;s father, Judge Scott, for sentencing him to prison for a crime he did not commit, not knowing that Hall was &quot;railroaded&quot;. White Fang kills Hall and is nearly killed himself, but survives. As a result, the women of Scott&#x27;s estate name him &quot;The Blessed Wolf&quot;. The story ends with White Fang relaxing in the sun with the puppies he has fathered with the sheep-dog Collie.

==Characters==
*White Fang, the novel&#x27;s protagonist; a wolfdog who was born wild but becomes more dog-like after Gray Beaver domesticates him. He gets bullied by Lip-lip and was forced to become a fighting dog when he was bought by Beauty Smith. However, his life changed when a loving master named Weedon Scott buys him and takes him to his home in Santa Clara Valley in California. He eventually becomes a part of the family after saving Judge Scott from Jim Hall.
*Kiche, White Fang&#x27;s mother, a sled dog formerly owned by Gray Beaver&#x27;s now-dead brother, known at the beginning of the novel as the &quot;she-wolf&quot;. Possibly named for the Algonquian deity Gitche Manitou.
*Lip-Lip, a canine pup who also lives in the Native American village and bullies White Fang until White Fang kills him in a fight.
*One-Eye, White Fang&#x27;s father, a true wolf, who was killed by the lynx.
*Cherokee, a bulldog who was the only dog to defeat White Fang until Weedon Scott saved White Fang.
*Collie, a sheepdog, mother of White Fang&#x27;s whelps.
*The Lynx, an aggressive Canada lynx who was responsible for killing One-Eye, but later gets killed by Kiche in retaliation.

Major human characters:
*Gray Beaver, a Native American chief who is White Fang&#x27;s first master. He is a neutral master, neither as cruel as Beauty Smith, nor as kind as Weedon Scott.
*Beauty Smith, the main antagonist of the novel and White Fang&#x27;s second master; a dogfighter.
*Weedon Scott, a wealthy gold hunter who is White Fang&#x27;s third master and the first one to truly show affection towards him.
*Matt, Weedon Scott&#x27;s assistant who helps tame White Fang.
*Judge Scott, Weedon Scott&#x27;s father who accepts White Fang as a member of the family after he saves him from Jim Hall.
*Jim Hall, a violent fugitive who tries to get revenge on Judge Scott but gets killed by White Fang.
*Henry, a character appearing in the introduction of the novel, carrying the coffin of Lord Alfred with Bill. 
*Bill, a character appearing in the introduction of the novel alongside Henry and was killed by the wolves led by Kiche.
*Three Eagles, a Native American who buys Kiche from Gray Beaver.

== Major themes ==
Critics have identified many underlying themes in the novel. Tom Feller describes the story as &quot;an allegory of humanity&#x27;s progression from nature to civilization&quot;. He also expresses that &quot;the [story&#x27;s] implication is that the metamorphosis of both the individual and society will require violence at some point.&quot; Paul Deane states that &quot;[in the novel] society demands a conformity that undermines individualism.&quot; London himself took influence from Herbert Spencer&#x27;s words: &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, as well as Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s idea of a &quot;superman&quot; (or &quot;superdog&quot;, in this instance) and of &quot;the worship of power&quot;.

The novel is partly an autobiographical allegory based on London&#x27;s conversion from teenage hoodlum to married, middle-class writer. In writing it, he was influenced by the ideas of Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Conditions in the US also influenced the story.

== Publication history ==
Since the novel has been published it has been translated into over 89 different languages and released as a three-volume Braille edition.

== Reception ==
Upon its release, &quot;White Fang&quot; was an immediate success worldwide, and became especially popular among younger readers. Robert Greenwood called &quot;White Fang&quot; &quot;one of London&#x27;s most interesting and ambitious works.&quot; Virginia Crane claims that the novel is &quot;generally regarded as artistically inferior to its companion piece [&quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;], but [that it] helped establish London as a popular American literary figure&quot;.

Shortly after the book&#x27;s publication, London became a target in what would later be called the nature fakers controversy, a literary debate highlighting the conflict between science and sentiment in popular nature writing. President Theodore Roosevelt, who first spoke out against the &quot;sham naturalists&quot; in 1907, specifically named London as one of the so-called &quot;nature fakers&quot;. Citing an example from &quot;White Fang&quot;, Roosevelt referred to the fight between the bulldog and the wolfdog &quot;the very sublimity of absurdity.&quot; London only responded to the criticism after the controversy had ended. In a 1908 essay entitled &quot;The Other Animals&quot;, he wrote:

== Adaptations ==
The novel has been adapted into numerous pictures and sequels, animated specials, as well as an audiobook format.

<text>Automatic Media was a web content site in 2000 to 2001.

==Foundation==
Automatic Media was created in July 2000 as a joint venture between Suck and Feed, two online magazines, after the publications had raised $4 million in venture capital financing from Lycos Ventures LP. Automatic Media&#x27;s first acquisition was Alt.culture, an online encyclopedia of alternative culture focused primarily on internet fads. Automatic Media allowed its member sites to use a shared advertising sales force, technologies, and administrative resources. The sites maintained distinctive brand names and editorial voices, but engaged in heavy cross-linking and advertising for their partner sites. In January 2001, Automatic Media announced its first original venture, Plastic.com. Plastic sought to minimize operational costs by running entirely on user-contributed stories. Its staff initially consisted of four people.

==Demise==
Less than a year after its foundation, Automatic Media&#x27;s subsidiaries declared bankruptcy, citing &quot;an inability to secure additional financing&quot;. Feed and Suck both announced that they were firing their staffs, and would no longer produce content. It was also announced that Plastic would continue with a skeleton staff working pro bono, although its fate was uncertain until bought by one of suck&#x27;s original founders Carl Steadman.

==Impact==
Automatic Media&#x27;s echoed the failure of many other web content sites. The failure of these sites disproved the common notion that the World Wide Web would make it easy for independent media sites to publish and distribute content for cheap compared with the cost of putting out print magazines. Combined with the questions raised by other dot-com collapses, investors were now questioning whether advertising alone could sustain the enormous and often underestimated costs of producing and hosting original material.

<doc id="703561" wikidata="Q1536323" url="?curid=703561" title="Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta">
<text>The Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, or California Delta, is an expansive inland river delta and estuary in Northern California. The delta is formed at the western edge of the Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and lies just east of where the rivers enter Suisun Bay, which flows into San Francisco Bay, then the Pacific Ocean via San Pablo Bay. The Delta is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy. Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta was designated a National Heritage Area on March 12, 2019. The city of Stockton is located on the San Joaquin River at the eastern edge of the delta. The total area of the Delta, including both land and water, is about . Its population is around 500,000.

The Delta was formed by rising sea level following glaciation, leading to the accumulation of Sacramento and San Joaquin River sediments behind the Carquinez Strait, the sole outlet from the Central Valley to San Pablo Bay. The narrowness of the Carquinez Strait coupled with tidal action has caused the sediment to pile up, forming expansive islands. Geologically, the Delta has existed for about 10,000 years, since the end of the Last Glacial Period. In its natural state, the Delta was a large freshwater marsh, consisting of many shallow channels and sloughs surrounding low islands of peat and tule.

Since the mid-19th century, most of the region has been gradually claimed for agriculture. Wind erosion and oxidation have led to widespread subsidence on the Central Delta islands; much of the Delta region today sits below sea level, behind levees earning it the nickname &quot;California&#x27;s Holland&quot;. Much of the water supply for Central California and Southern California is also derived from the Delta, via pumps located at the southern end of the Delta. The pumps deliver water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley and municipal water supply for Southern California.

==Geography==

The Delta consists of approximately 57 reclaimed islands and tracts but there are nearly 200 islands in the delta that are named or not named. These are all surrounded by of levees that border of waterways. The southwestern side of the Delta lies at the foothills of the California Coast Ranges, while to the northwest sit the lower Montezuma Hills. Most of the Delta lies within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano and Yolo Counties. The total human population of the Delta was 515,264 as of 2000.

Altogether, the Delta covers , with , or nearly 73 percent, devoted to agriculture. About of the Delta area is urban and are undeveloped land. The rivers, streams, sloughs and waterways of the Delta total about of surface, although this fluctuates greatly with seasons and tides. Geologically, it is not considered a true river delta, but rather an inverted river delta, as it formed inward (sediments accumulating progressively inland) rather than outward. The only other major river delta in the world located this far inland is the Pearl River Delta in China.

The main source rivers include the Sacramento River from the north, the San Joaquin from the southeast, and the Calaveras and Mokelumne Rivers from the east. The Calaveras and Mokelumne are both tributaries of the San Joaquin River. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers join at the western end of the Delta near Pittsburg, at the head of Suisun Bay, although they are linked upstream by the Georgiana Slough, which was first used by steamboats in the 19th century as a shortcut between Sacramento and Stockton. The southwestern part of the Delta is also transected by the Middle River and Old River, former channels of the San Joaquin. These rivers transport more than of water through the Delta each year – about 50 percent of all California&#x27;s runoff.

Nearby cities include Lodi and Stockton to the east, Tracy and Manteca to the south, Brentwood to the southwest, and Pittsburg and Antioch to the west. The state capital, Sacramento, is located just to the north of the Delta.

The Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel connects the Delta to the Port of Sacramento, with its terminus located near Rio Vista, on the northwestern side of the Delta. The Stockton Ship Channel is a dredged and partially straightened section of the San Joaquin River cutting directly through the Delta from the Port of Stockton to the San Joaquin&#x27;s confluence with the Sacramento near Antioch.

==Geology, formation and natural conditions==

The Delta was formerly located at the bottom of a large inland sea in the Central Valley, which formed as the uplift of the California Coast Ranges blocked off drainage from the Sierra Nevada to the Pacific. About 560,000 years ago, water breached the mountains, carving out the present-day Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay. The drainage of all the water through this narrow gap formed a bottleneck in the Central Valley&#x27;s outflow; this constriction is essential to provoke the slowing of river current and the resulting sediment deposits that now make up the Delta.

The Delta in its contemporary (pre-1850s) state began to form about 10,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. During the Ice Age global sea levels were about lower than today, and the Delta region, as well as Suisun Bay, the Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay, were a river valley through which the continuation of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers flowed to the Pacific Ocean. When sea levels rose again, ocean water backed up through the Carquinez Strait into the Central Valley; the combination of the narrow strait and tidal action pushing inland dramatically slowed the current of these rivers and forced them to drop sediment. The early delta was composed of shifting channels, sand dunes, alluvial fans and floodplains that underwent constant fluctuation because of rapidly rising seas – per year. About 8,000 years ago, the rate of sea-level rise slackened, allowing wetland plants to take hold in the Delta, trapping sediment; the growth and decay of these plants began to form the vast peat deposits that make up the Delta islands. The Delta reached a stabilized form similar to its mid-1800s state about 2,000–3,000 years ago.
Immediately before large-scale human development, most of the Delta islands had saucer-like cross sections, with low natural levees flanking a marshy interior &quot;bowl&quot; that flooded intermittently with the seasons and tides. The height of these natural levees, formed from overbank deposits of sediments deposited by annual river floods, ranged from above mean high tide at Sherman Island on the Sacramento River, to at Andrus, Staten and Tyler Islands, located further east near the Mokelumne River. An estimated 60 percent of the Delta flooded for up to two hours each day at high tide; during spring tides or river floods, it was not uncommon for the entire Delta to be under water.

==History==
Humans have inhabited the Delta for up to 4,300 years. The estimated indigenous population of the Delta at the time of first contact with Europeans was about 3,000–15,000, predominantly Miwok and Maidu, with some estimates ranging up to 20,000. The Native Americans lived in villages of 200–1,000 people on the eastern edge of the Delta, where the land was higher and less susceptible to flooding. Their lives centered around the abundant reeds or tules that grew on the Delta islands, which they used to make houses, boats, and garments. Staple foods included tule roots and pollen, acorns, wild fruits and seeds, fish and game.

Europeans first entered the Delta region in 1772, when Spanish explorer Don Pedro Fages and missionary Juan Crespí observed the Delta from the summit of nearby Mount Diablo. For decades, the Delta was little utilized by the Spanish colonists. Expeditions from 1806 to 1812 failed to locate suitable mission sites in the Delta area. However, frequent military expeditions were made into the Delta from 1813 to 1845 in response to animosities between the Native Americans and the Spanish and later Mexicans; also several land grants were made in the vicinity of the Delta, including one to John Augustus Sutter, who started the first significant European settlement in the Central Valley just north of the Delta near present-day Sacramento.
The Spanish conscripted large numbers of Native Americans for labor on missions; many Native Americans fled deep into the Delta in order to escape their European masters. However, this did not protect them from diseases. A malaria epidemic in 1833 decimated local native populations; this was probably exacerbated by the marshy geography of the area, which bred large amounts of mosquitoes.

The agricultural value of the Delta was first recognized during the California Gold Rush, when farmers planted orchards on Delta islands to provide fresh fruit for mining camps in the Sierra Nevada. Because of the flat terrain coupled with year-round availability of fresh water, irrigation here was cheaper and simpler than other fertile regions of California. As a result, the Delta remained California&#x27;s richest farming region (alongside Los Angeles County) until the 1940s, when massive federal water projects finally made possible the full-scale irrigation of the main body of the Central Valley. Today, the Delta is still among the state&#x27;s most productive farming regions.

In 1850, Congress passed the Arkansas or Swampland Act, which allowed for the transfer of title for wetlands to private owners on the conditions that the land would be reclaimed. In California, more than of wetlands were partitioned under the Swampland Act, of which were in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta, roughly the same amount of land that has been developed to date. Agricultural interests in the Delta were protected by the building of levees, a colossal effort first undertaken by Chinese laborers from the 1850s to the 1870s. The Board of Reclamation, formed in 1861, collectivized levee construction in the Delta by grouping islands into areas known as &quot;reclamation districts&quot;. The early levees were built of peat, and were highly susceptible to wind and water erosion. The Great Flood of 1862 obliterated much of the existing Delta infrastructure, forcing landowners to rebuild their levees higher and stronger; more flooding in 1878 and 1881 reinforced these notions.

Although land holdings in the Delta were initially limited to per buyer, this limit was repealed in 1868, allowing large agricultural conglomerates to take entire islands and carry out massive reclamation projects. From 1868 to 1869, the entirety of Sherman Island, some , was diked and drained by a system of levees, flumes and floodgates. By the 1890s, the original levee system had been largely replaced with stronger embankments consisting of clay dredged from nearby river bottoms. By 1900, about , or nearly half of the Delta&#x27;s land area, had been reclaimed. Most of the farmable land in the Delta had been reclaimed by the 1920s.

==Economy and human use==

===Agriculture===
The Delta produces crops valued at about $650 million annually (for the 1998–2004 period), making it one of the most productive farming regions of the United States in terms of crop value per unit area. Agriculture provides secondary benefits of over $2 billion to the local economy. Major crops grown in the Delta include corn, grain, hay, sugar beets, alfalfa, tomatoes, asparagus, and safflower; various fruits are also raised here, as well as some livestock. Crops in the Delta cannot be irrigated using conventional methods due to the highly absorbent quality of the peat soil and irregularities caused by land subsidence. Irrigation is typically carried out periodically by piping water into small &quot;spud ditches&quot;, which spread water over large areas and raise the local water table. The heightened groundwater is then gradually depleted by the crop until irrigation is required again.

===Transportation===
Delta waterways are also major transportation corridors for agricultural products; the ports of Sacramento and Stockton, located on the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, respectively, are the most important inland ports in California. The San Joaquin River throughout most of the Delta and the lower Sacramento River below its connection to the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel are routinely dredged to allow the passage of large cargo ships. The Sacramento River corridor has been maintained to a depth of as early as 1899, and was deepened to in 1955. The Stockton Ship Channel has been dredged since 1913; however, its present depth of was only achieved in 1987. The Delta is also home to the port of Benicia, an automobile and bulk shipping facility. Petroleum is shipped to both the Benicia Refinery and the Martinez Refinery by water. Nearby is the Port Chicago Marine Ocean Terminal, a facility that supports the U.S. Navy.

===Water supply===

The Delta is often considered the nexus of California&#x27;s statewide water system. About half the total river flow in the state passes through this region, from which water is exported to other areas of the San Joaquin Valley, Southern California and portions of the Bay area to supply some of farmland and 23 million people in central and Southern California. The Delta provides an estimated of water per year, of which about are exported to the San Francisco Bay Area, are used locally, and over are exported to the San Joaquin Valley, coastal Central and Southern California.

Intrusion of brackish water into the Delta is a recurring natural phenomenon; however, it became a serious issue after the development of agriculture in the upper Sacramento and San Joaquin valley reduced inflows. Multiple droughts between 1910 and 1940 caused significant salinity intrusion in the Delta because of the reduction of freshwater inflows. The growing Delta water quality issue provided the initial impetus for building dams on Central Valley rivers to boost dry-season freshwater flows. This eventually became the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), California&#x27;s first major statewide water system, most of which was built between the 1930s and the 1960s.

Today, the California Aqueduct and the Delta-Mendota Canal, two of the state&#x27;s largest water conveyance facilities, both draw water from the southern end of the Delta at the Clifton Court Forebay. Built in the mid-twentieth century, the former supplies water to the Los Angeles Basin and coastal central California via the State Water Project; the latter, a part of the CVP, provides supplies of irrigation water in the fertile San Joaquin Valley. Although the vast majority of water supplied by these projects is used for agriculture and urban areas, some water is also provided for wildlife refuges and habitat conservation works. The Contra Costa Canal and North Bay Aqueduct also take Delta water, supplying the nearby San Francisco Bay Area. Locally, the Delta provides water for cities and towns in five counties and for over 1,800 agricultural users.

=== Recreation ===
The Delta is also a popular site for recreation and is used for sailing, waterskiing, houseboating, fishing, and hunting. The Delta is home to over 100 marinas and 25 yacht clubs. In 2010, over seven million &#x27;annual visitor boating days&#x27; occurred on the Delta, according to a local government survey.

The Delta is home to several state and regional parks, reflecting a variety of recreational activities. These include historical interpretative centers, including Delta Meadows and Locke Boarding House and the Old Sacramento State Historic Park. The Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial offers visitors a chance to learn about the disaster that represented the largest domestic loss of life in the U.S. in World War II, and the impact it had on race relations in the U.S. military.

Brannan Island State Recreation Area offers boat launches and facilities that support fishing, windsurfing, waterskiing, and sailing, in addition to campsites, picnic areas and trails to allow visitors to explore the marshes and islands of the area.

Originally a Delta farming island, Franks Tract flooded in 1936 and again in 1938. The levees were never repaired and the island remained submerged, becoming an expanse of open water dotted with remnants of the original levees now the only landforms. In 1959, the area became a state park. Franks Tract State Recreation Area is accessible only by water and is used for fishing, waterfowl hunting, and boating.

The Pacific Flyway, a north–south route for migratory birds, crosses the Delta. The migratory birds provide both birdwatching and hunting opportunities. Including the northern Suisun Marsh, there are over 150 private duck clubs in the area.

==Effects of the levee system and freshwater diversion==

The levee system allowed farmers to drain and reclaim almost of the Delta, then a tidal marsh. Once the rivers were confined to their riverbeds, the peat soil of the former tidal marsh was exposed to oxygen. As the oxygen-rich peat soil decomposed and then released carbon dioxide, profound subsidence of the land resulted, of up to 25 feet since the late 1800s.

Currently, most of the Delta is below sea level, with a great deal of the western and central Delta at least below sea level. The California Department of Water Resources has experimented with re-flooding areas for wetland restoration, in order to sequester carbon and rebuild soil levels. In addition, shallow flooding of land to restore anaerobic conditions is used as a sedimentation enhancing strategy to reduce subsidence and restore the wetlands in the Delta.

Land subsidence has endangered the Delta&#x27;s system of protective levees, occasionally triggering levee failure and subsequent flooding.

Land subsidence also allows brackish water intrusion into the Delta, an issue compounded by the diversion of up to 25% of the freshwater flowing into the Delta. The decreased volume of freshwater in the Delta has had a profound effect on its ecology. In most years, large dams in the Delta watershed fully hold back spring runoff; as a result the Delta is most susceptible to salinity intrusion between February and June. However, regulation provided by dams helps boost freshwater flows during dry summers and autumns, reducing the risk of salinity intrusion in these months.

Diversions located at the southern end of the Delta, however, have negated some of the benefits of upstream dams. The powerful pumps that supply water for the Central Valley Project and State Water Project cause water in the Delta to flow from north to south instead of the natural direction of east to west. This has caused multiple environmental issues, such as the disruption of fish migration and salinity buildup in the eastern Delta, where salts can no longer be flushed to the sea by natural river flows.

==Levee failures==

Since 1900, there have been over 160 levee failures in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. These numbers include multiple failures of a single levee structure. Levee failures, also known as breaches, can be caused by overtopping or structural failure. One of the most recent examples of levee failure in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta occurred in June 2004 when a levee breach caused more than of water to flood the entire island of Jones Tract.

But, the significant improvements made to the Delta levee system since 1982 have reduced the incidence of failures to this one major failure in 30 years. The most up-to-date description and discussion of the Delta levee system can be found in the Economic Sustainability Plan of the Delta Protection Commission. This study concluded that the Delta levee system is now relatively robust but should be improved to effectively eliminate the risk of failure in extreme floods and earthquakes. It emphasizes the significant value of the infrastructure that passes through the Delta, including water conveyance, in addition to life and property, and the value of the Delta as a Place.

A 2019 article states that &quot;a catastrophic levee failure, defined as 20 islands flooding at once, has a 62 percent chance of occurring in the next two decades if subsidence isn’t addressed.&quot;

Simultaneous levee failures on the Delta&#x27;s 57 islands in the wake of an earthquake which allow the inflow of brackish San Francisco Bay waters could threaten the water supply for the Central Valley, which includes both the irrigation water for its $17 billion agricultural economy and the drinking water for about 25 million people.

==Ecology==
About 500 plant and animal species inhabit the Delta, which is one of the largest estuaries in western North America. Before agricultural development of the Delta region, the Delta&#x27;s many islands were forested by Tule, bulrush, and various reeds that flourished in intermittently flooded, low-lying marshy areas. Over thousands of years, the growth and decay of the various swampland plants formed a layer of peat deep in places, hence the extremely high fertility of Delta soils. Sediment deposits formed natural levees around the borders of islands, where larger trees, mainly willows, were able to take root and form large riparian forests. The riparian forests were most pronounced along the Sacramento River and the lower Mokelumne River below its confluence with the Cosumnes River. More extensive woodlands were prominent on the fringes of the Delta bordering the riparian zones. Composed primarily of valley oak, box elder and Oregon ash, these oak woodlands grew in bands that stretched up to inland. Farther away from water sources, vegetation gave way to grassland. The water hyacinth has become one of the most destructive plants to the Delta water way. Within one year it will spread and cover as much as of water space in one growing season. It has become a challenge to the agricultural community to eliminate. The plants spread by budding and spreading its seeds, and those seeds fall to the bottom of the water, where they can stay viable in the muck for years. The Hyacinth can form a mat up to thick, shutting off light and becoming acidic when they decompose.

The Delta was formerly populated by large herds of deer and tule elk; their trails were so vast that early Spanish explorers supposed the area was inhabited by cattle. Significant numbers of California grizzly bears could also be found in the Delta. The extensive wetlands of the Delta supported massive bird populations, half the migrating waterfowl in California continue to pass through the Delta. A survey in 2012 recorded a spring duck population of 48.6 million, the highest since counts began in 1955. Large mammals in the Delta have not fared so well; with most of their habitat converted to agriculture, remaining populations were highly susceptible to human impacts and natural disasters. Grizzlies were hunted to extinction, while the flood of 1878 wiped out the last of the elk herds in the Delta.

The Delta is home to approximately 22 species of fish, including several Pacific salmon species, striped bass, steelhead trout, American shad and sturgeon. About two-thirds of California&#x27;s salmon pass through the Delta on their way upstream to spawn. The small Delta smelt is a key indicator species for the health of the Delta&#x27;s ecosystem. Delta fish populations have been significantly reduced due to the reclamation of marshland and diversions of fresh water. In 2004, the Delta smelt was found to be on the edge of extinction. The survival of the Delta smelt has been one of the largest environmental issues in California, as environmental measures enacted to protect its population have often reduced the amount of water available for federal water projects that depend on water pumped from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Central and South parts of the Delta due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. In addition, there is a notice of &quot;DO NOT EAT&quot; for any fish or shellfish from the Port of Stockton. There is a separate safe eating advisory for the Northern part of the Delta. A 2010 study shows that the anglers in the Delta who ate these fish had higher levels of mercury in their system. Delta fish have also been found to have high levels of a toxin called methylmercury which originates from old gold rush era mines in the Sierras. In that same study, it was found that women along the delta were consuming high numbers of fish, making them more susceptible to poisoning.

Nutria were found in Merced County in 2017 on the edge of the Delta. State officials are concerned that they will harm the infrastructure that sends water to San Joaquin Valley farms and urban areas.

The Delta has seen numerous cyanobacteria blooms with increasing frequency over the past two decades. Cyanobacteria have the potential to produce cyanotoxins which can pose a risk to humans and animals upon contact. Because of this cyanobacteria blooms are seen as a threat that has the potential to impact human life. Several types of toxic cyanobacteria have appeared in the Delta, with &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot; being one of the most common types. &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot; produce microcystins which are hepatotoxins that can cause liver cancer. Frequent &quot;Microcystis&quot; blooms have impacted the food web of the Delta at multiple trophic levels. &quot;Microcystis spp.&quot; blooms in the Delta were found to decrease the diversity of the aquatic microbial community. Additionally, the cyanobacteria blooms in the Delta have led to decreased zooplankton mass and density. There is also concern for further spread throughout the food web via bioaccumulation. Microcystins were detected in the tissue of clams at levels much higher than the ambient water around them because of microcystin&#x27;s ability to covalently bind to tissue.

The increased occurrences of cyanobacteria blooms in the Delta can be attributed to a variety of factors with the most important being lowered streamflow. From 2004 through 2008 researchers collected different water quality parameters during the cyanobacteria blooms and determined that the blooms appeared after reaching a threshold of 19 °C (66 °F) which was exacerbated by reduced precipitation, reduced streamflow, and increased nutrient concentrations. They also determined that the negative attributes associated with climate change like reduced precipitation and increased temperatures could further increase the possibility of cyanobacteria blooms in the Delta. The high prevalence of nutrient concentrations in the Delta also plays a significant part in the increased frequency of &quot;Microcystis&quot; &quot;aeruginosa&quot; blooms. &quot;Microcystis&quot; benefits greatly from anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen which allows it to out-compete other primary producers and dominate the lower trophic levels. There have also been large amounts of nutrients monitored in the Delta as a result of various human activities.

The increased presence of &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot; blooms in the Delta represents a continual threat for species at multiple trophic levels. The lower trophic levels are affected from both reduced diversity as well as reduced numbers through competition. When the conditions are met &quot;Microcystis&quot; have the ability to dominate the lower trophic levels hence why they are able to bloom. Additionally, when microcystins are present in the system then the consumers in the food web are at risk due to the effects of bioaccumulation. Fish that are present and active during cyanobacteria blooms can often have microcystin levels high enough to produce sublethal effects. Because microcystins can concentrate inside fish at multiple trophic levels it also represents a risk for human consumption as well.

==Conservation efforts==
After numerous rounds of mitigation following the 2005 Smelt Biological Opinion (BiOp) lead to pumping restrictions from the State and Federal projects from the Delta, a number of potential solutions to the Delta&#x27;s problems have been proposed. These followed the CALFED process which had offered several staged solutions. A first set of alternatives would maintain the Delta in its current condition and configuration. The second would restore parts of the Delta more closely to its natural state but include the construction of an additional Peripheral Canal to maintain the water supply currently provided by the Delta.
The Contra Costa County Public Works Department is working with the California Coastal Commission and the Department of Boating and Waterways to protect the drinking water quality, prevent pollution, and promote the environmental health of the Delta.

In April 2009, the Sacramento River in the Delta was declared the nation&#x27;s most endangered waterway system by the environmental group American Rivers, due to water shortages caused by the Delta&#x27;s environmental problems, declining fish populations and aging levees, among other problems.

Since the 1940s, various groups have lobbied for the construction of a Peripheral Canal to redirect water flowing from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers directly to the federal aqueducts that draw water from the southern end of the Delta. Currently, freshwater entering the Delta has to flow through a maze of river channels and sloughs before entering the Clifton Court Forebay north of Tracy, where water is pumped into the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal. In addition, large numbers of Delta smelt and other endangered species are killed by the pumping plants that provide water for the aqueducts.

The current proposal, known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan, entails building twin tunnels under the delta and is closely associated with Governor Jerry Brown. However, the Peripheral Canal proposal has been criticized because it would further reduce the amount of freshwater flowing through the Delta. Farmers in the Delta are among the most opposed to the project because it would decrease the amount of water available to them for irrigation.

All solutions, however, aim to produce a Delta which simultaneously supports a vibrant ecosystem and continues to supply fresh water to the Central Valley Project, the State Water Project and the Bay Area.

Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area was designated on March 12, 2019, the first such designation for California, as part of the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. The Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area is managed by the Delta Protection Commission.

<text>Erica Lei Leerhsen (born February 14, 1976) is an American actress. She first gained recognition for her leading part in the moderately successful horror sequel &quot;Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2&quot; (2000). Her work led her to take on a recurring role in the first season of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and star in the horror hit &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003). She has since appeared in numerous films of that genre, including &quot;Wrong Turn 2: Dead End&quot; (2007), &quot;Lonely Joe&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Butterfly Room&quot; (2012), and is considered a scream queen. She has also acted in the Woody Allen films &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot; (2002), &quot;Anything Else&quot; (2003) and &quot;Magic in the Moonlight&quot; (2014) as well as in Allen&#x27;s play &quot;A Second-Hand Memory&quot; (2004).

==Early life==
Leerhsen was born in New York City, and was raised in Ossining, Westchester County, New York, along with her two younger sisters, Debbie and Nora. Their father, Charles Leerhsen, is a longtime editor of celebrity publication &quot;Us Weekly&quot;. She attended St. Augustine&#x27;s School and Ossining High School and attended the Boston University College of Fine Arts. While in college, Leerhsen performed in stage productions of &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. After graduating in 1998, she earned BFA in acting the same year.

==Career==
===2000s===
Leerhsen made her film debut in the short film &quot;Junior Creative&quot; (2000), as Sarah, and shortly afterwards, she appeared in the horror sequel &quot;Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2&quot; (2000), though she originally auditioned for the part that eventually went to Kim Director. Upon its premiere, the sequel received extremely negative reviews by critics, but grossed US$26.4 million in North America, and went on to gross US$47.7 million globally. She was nominated for the Fangoria Chainsaw Award for her supporting role in that movie. Leerhsen&#x27;s profile raised significantly and her work in the film was followed by a number of appearances on television. In 2001, she guest-starred in an episode of the third season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, where she played a lesbian tennis instructor who falls for Drea de Matteo&#x27;s character, and became a member of the cast of the television series &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where she played Amanda Bowles, an ambitious but caring associate, who leaves midway through season one. She played a supporting role in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Ending&quot;. Screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. the film garnered a mixed critical response while it grossed a lukewarm US$14.5 million at the end of its theatrical run.
Leerhsen starred alongside Jessica Biel in the horror remake &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003), where she took on the role of one of the doomed teens. In a 2007 interview with website &quot;Icons of Fright&quot;, she admitted that in her audition for the movie, she screamed so loud that people on other floors of the building called the police to report that a woman was being attacked. Reviews for the film were mixed, but it was a box office success, scoring the number-one spot in its opening week and going on to earn more than $80 million in the U.S. Leerhsen became a prominent figure among horror films actors; &quot;Arrow in the Head&quot; honored her as the &quot;Mistress of the Year 2003&quot;. Also in 2003, Leerhsen was a guest star in two episodes of the TV show &quot;Alias&quot;, and appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s romantic comedy film &quot;Anything Else&quot;, opposite Jason Biggs, Christina Ricci, Stockard Channing, Danny DeVito and Jimmy Fallon. She reunited with Allen in his play &quot;A Second-Hand Memory&quot; (2004), where she portrayed what was described by &quot;Variety&quot; as a &quot;sweet secretary and superficial, nouveau-riche Hollywood wife&quot;.

Leerhsen starred opposite Michael Peña in the independent comedy drama film &quot;Little Athens&quot; (2005), which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was released straight-to-DVD, to a mixed critical reception. While &quot;Variety&quot; remarked that Leerhsen and co-star Jill Ritchie were &quot;stuck with narrowly conceived, deeply dislikable gals&quot;, she was praised by Mark Bell from &quot;Film Threat&quot; who, in his review, wrote that the actress &quot;proves that the &quot;Blair Witch 2&quot; was as much a blip in her acting skill as the film was in the pop culture conscienceness. Her interplay with Rachel Miner is true in the way that smalltown friendships really are: simple seemingly on the surface, but built on such complex webbing and history that every nuance, statement or situation is to be weighed and studied.&quot;

In 2006, Leerhsen made a guest appearance in the TV show &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, and appeared as the female leading character Bronwin in the romantic comedy &quot;Mozart and the Whale&quot;, which was released in limited theaters. Leerhsen also guest appeared in a 2006 episode of the CBS crime drama series &quot;&quot;. In the drama &quot;The Warrior Class&quot;, Leerhsen played the drug-addict wife of a mafia boss (Jake Webber). The film was filmed in 2004 but was released directly-to-DVD on February 6, 2007.

She headlined the horror sequel &quot;Wrong Turn 2: Dead End&quot; (2007), directed by Joe Lynch and co-starring Henry Rollins and Texas Battle. Unlike the 2003 film, the sequel premiered on DVD, but rated favorably with reviewers while it made US$9 million in domestic home video sales. &quot;DVD Talk&quot; critic David Walker found her to be a &quot;stand out&quot; and noted that she &quot;puts a great spin on what could easily have been another tired retread of the scream queen character&quot;. Brian Collins of &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot; stated that Leerhsen &quot;continues to impress&quot; and that she had &quot;got chops far beyond what is required for this type of film&quot;. That year she was meant to star in another horror film — &quot;Shutter&quot;, opposite Joshua Jackson — portraying a character named Allison Carter, although ultimately she does not appear in the final production.

Leerhsen next had the lead role in the horror-thriller film &quot;Living Hell&quot;, where she played Carrie Freeborn, a hazmat specialist. The film, written and directed by Richard Jefferies, premiered on the SCI FI Channel on February 23, 2008, and was released on DVD under the title &quot;Organizm&quot; on June 10 in the United States. In 2009, the independent horror film &quot;Lonely Joe&quot; — in which Leerhsen starred — premiered in the festival circuit and was released for digital markets and selected theaters. Filming began on October 15, 2007 and wrapped on November 6, 2007. Leerhsen took on the role of Michele Connelly, a New York City reporter who returns to her hometown 10 years after the mysterious murder of her younger brother. Doing her own stunts for the film, she was nearly hit by the train when she lost her balance and lunged forward while shooting a sequence. Her scene was shot with her only 12 inches from the side of the train as it passed by at 30 miles per hour. Unshaken, she insisted on shooting the scene again.

===2010s===
Leerhsen filmed a comedic short film entitled &quot;First Dates&quot;, exploring the dating scene of several single people. The production premiered at the AFI screening room in Los Angeles on January 8, 2011. She made one-episode appearances in &quot;The Good Wife&quot; in 2011 and in &quot;Person of Interest&quot; in 2012. She portrayed the next-door neighbor of a bipolar and butterfly-obsessed elderly lady (Barbara Steele) in &quot;The Butterfly Room&quot;, an Italian–American horror production, produced by Ethan Wiley and directed by Jonathan Zarantonello. The film premiered throughout the European film circuit in 2012, and was released in Italy on June 6, 2014, and in the US in one theater on April 11, 2014. Leerhsen starred in the low-budget horror &quot;The Message&quot;, which premiered at the 2012 Cape Fear Independent Film Festival and revolved around a young woman who is forced to come to terms with her personality flaws.

Leerhseen starred in the independent thriller &quot;Phobia&quot;, as Lesley Parker, a female doctor in the 19th century dedicated to help a group of people with their phobias who becomes embroiled in a murder mystery surrounding a patient that may be a vampire. The film was released on September 1, 2013. She played a supporting role in &quot;Mischief Night&quot;, a small-scale slasher released on October 30, 2013, for DVD and a limited theatrical run.

Leerhsen appeared in Woody Allen romantic comedy &quot;Magic in the Moonlight&quot; (2014) portraying the role of Caroline, a member of a rich American family in the 1920s French Riviera. The film, starring Emma Stone, Jacki Weaver, Colin Firth, and Marcia Gay Harden, received mixed reviews from critics, but was an arthouse success. Her work in the movie marked the fourth time Leerhsen has worked with Allen, who praised her for her acting abilities; &quot;Every time I cast her, she comes through without fail. She shows up, she asks no questions, she does the character — I have no idea how she has worked it out — and it’s always effective&quot;.

<doc id="703576" wikidata="Q337057" url="?curid=703576" title="Louis I, Duke of Orléans">
<text>Louis I (13 March 1372 – 23 November 1407) was Duke of Orléans from 1392 to his death in 1407. He was also Duke of Touraine (1386–1392), Count of Valois (1386?–1406) Blois (1397–1407), Angoulême (1404–1407), Périgord (1400–1407) and Soissons (1404–07). 

Louis was the younger brother of King Charles VI of France, and a powerful and polarizing figure in his day. Owing to the King&#x27;s highly public struggles with mental illness, Louis worked with Charles&#x27;s wife Queen Isabeau to try to lead the kingdom during Charles&#x27;s frequent bouts of insanity. He struggled for control of France with John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. Louis was unpopular with the citizens of Paris due to his reputation for womanizing and his role in the &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot; tragedy, which resulted in the deaths of four French nobles and the near death of the king himself. He was assassinated in 1407 on orders of John the Fearless; John not only admitted to his role in the murder, but bragged openly about it. What began as a feud between factions of the royal family erupted into open warfare as a result of Louis&#x27;s death. Louis&#x27;s grandson would later become king of France as Louis XII.

==Biography==
Born 13 March 1372, Louis was the second son of King Charles V of France and Joanna of Bourbon and was the younger brother of Charles VI.
In 1374, Louis was betrothed to Catherine, heir presumptive to the throne of Hungary. Louis and Catherine were expected to reign either over Hungary or over Poland, as Catherine&#x27;s father, Louis I of Hungary, had no sons. Catherine&#x27;s father also planned to leave them his claim to the Crown of Naples and the County of Provence, which were then held by his ailing and childless cousin Joanna I. However, Catherine&#x27;s death in 1378 ended the marriage negotiations. In 1384, Elizabeth of Bosnia started negotiating with Louis&#x27; father about the possibility of Louis marrying her daughter Mary, notwithstanding Mary&#x27;s engagement to Sigismund of Luxembourg. If Elizabeth had made this proposal in 1378, after Catherine&#x27;s death, the fact that the French king and the Hungarian king no longer recognised the same pope would have presented a problem. However, Elizabeth was desperate in 1384 and was not willing to let the schism stand in the way of the negotiations. Antipope Clement VII issued a dispensation which annulled Mary&#x27;s betrothal to Sigismund and a proxy marriage between Louis and Mary was celebrated in April 1385. Nonetheless, the marriage was not recognised by the Hungarian noblemen who adhered to Pope Urban VI. Four months after the proxy marriage, Sigismund invaded Hungary and married Mary, which ultimately destroyed Louis&#x27; chances to reign as King of Hungary.

===Role in court and the Hundred Years&#x27; War===

Louis played an important political role during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. In 1392, his elder brother Charles the Mad (who may have suffered from either schizophrenia, porphyria, paranoid schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder) experienced the first in a lifelong series of attacks of &#x27;insanity&#x27;. It soon became clear that Charles was unable to rule independently. In 1393 a regency council presided over by Queen Isabeau was formed, and Louis gained powerful influence.

Louis disputed the regency and guardianship of the royal children, initially with Philip the Bold until his death in 1404, and then with Philip&#x27;s son John the Fearless. The enmity between the two was public and a source of political unrest in the already troubled country. Louis had the initial advantage over John, being the brother rather than the first cousin of the king, but his reputation as a womanizer and the rumour of an affair with Queen Isabeau made him extremely unpopular. In the following years, the children of Charles VI were successively kidnapped and recovered by both parties, until John the Fearless was appointed by royal decree as guardian of the Dauphin Louis and regent of France.

Louis did not give up and made every effort to sabotage John&#x27;s rule, including squandering the money raised for the siege of Calais, then occupied by the English. After this episode, John and Louis broke into open threats and only the intervention of John, Duke of Berry, and uncle of both men, avoided a civil war.

Louis was reportedly responsible for the deaths of four dancers at a disastrous 1393 masquerade ball that became known as the &quot;Bal des Ardents&quot; (Ball of the Burning Men). The four victims were burnt alive when a torch held by Louis came too close to their highly flammable costumes. Two other dancers wearing the same costumes (one of whom was Charles VI himself) narrowly escaped a similar fate.

==Assassination==
On Sunday, 20 November, 1407, the contending Dukes exchanged solemn vows of reconciliation before the court of France. But only three days later, Louis was brutally assassinated in the streets of Paris, on John&#x27;s orders. Louis was stabbed while mounting his horse by fifteen masked criminals led by Raoulet d&#x27;Anquetonville, a servant of the Duke of Burgundy.
An attendant was severely wounded.

John the Fearless was supported by the population of Paris and the University. He could even publicly admit the killing. Rather than deny it, John had the scholar Jean Petit of the Sorbonne deliver a peroration justifying the murder as tyrannicide.

Louis&#x27;s murder sparked a bloody feud and civil war between Burgundy and the French royal family which divided France for the next twenty-eight years, ending with the Treaty of Arras in 1435.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1389, Louis married Valentina Visconti, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. They had:
# A son (born and died Paris, 25 March 1390), buried in Paris église Saint-Paul.
# Louis (Paris, Hôtel de Saint-Pol, 26 May 1391 – September 1395), buried Paris église des Célestins.
# John (September 1393 – Château de Vincennes, bef. 31 October 1393), buried Paris église des Célestins.
#Charles, Duke of Orléans (Hôtel royal de Saint-Pol, Paris, 24 November 1394 – Château d&#x27;Amboise, Indre-et-Loire, 4 January 1465), father of Louis XII, King of France.
# Philip, Count of Vertus (Asnières-sur-Oise, Val d&#x27;Oise, 21/24 July 1396 – Beaugency, Loiret, 1 September 1420). Left a natural son Philip Anthony, called the Bastard of Vertus who died about 1445; no issue.
# John, Count of Angoulême (24 June 1399 – Château de Cognac, Charente, 30 April 1467), grandfather of Francis I of France 
# Marie (Château de Coucy, Aisne, April 1401 – died shortly after birth).
# Margaret (4 December 1406 – Abbaye de Laguiche, near Blois, 24 April 1466), married Richard of Brittany, Count of Étampes. She received the County of Vertus as a dowry. Ancestors of the Dukes of Brittany and Lords of Chalon-Arlay and Prince of Orange.

By Mariette d&#x27;Enghien, his mistress, Louis had an illegitimate son:
# Jean de Dunois (1402–1468), ancestor of the Dukes of Longueville

<text>Richard Gordon Gould (July 17, 1920 – September 16, 2005) was an American physicist who is sometimes credited with the invention of the laser and the optical amplifier. (Credit for the invention of the laser is disputed, since Charles Townes and Arthur Schawlow were the first to publish the theory and Theodore Maiman was the first to build a working laser). Gould is best known for his thirty-year fight with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to obtain patents for the laser and related technologies. He also fought with laser manufacturers in court battles to enforce the patents he subsequently did obtain.

==Early life and education==

Gould was born in New York City in 1920. He was the oldest of three sons. His father was the founding editor of Scholastic Magazine Publications in New York City. His mother encouraged his interest in inventors such as Thomas Edison and gave him a toy Erector set at an early age. He grew up in Scarsdale, a small suburb of New York, and attended Scarsdale High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science in physics at Union College, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity, and a master&#x27;s degree at Yale University, specializing in optics and spectroscopy. Between March 1944 and January 1945 he worked on the Manhattan Project but was dismissed due to his activities as a member of the Communist Political Association. In 1949 Gould went to Columbia University to work on a doctorate in optical and microwave spectroscopy. His doctoral supervisor was Nobel laureate Polykarp Kusch, who guided Gould to develop expertise in the then-new optical pumping technique. In 1956, Gould proposed using optical pumping to excite a maser, and discussed this idea with the maser&#x27;s inventor Charles Townes, who was also a professor at Columbia. Townes gave Gould advice on how to obtain a patent on his innovation, and agreed to act as a witness.

==Invention of the laser==
By 1957, many scientists including Townes sought a way to achieve maser-like amplification of visible light. In November of that year, Gould realized that one could make an appropriate optical resonator by using two mirrors as a Fabry–Pérot interferometer. Unlike previously considered designs, this approach would produce a narrow, coherent, intense beam. Since the sides of the cavity did not need to be reflective, the gain medium could easily be optically pumped to achieve the necessary population inversion. Gould also considered pumping of the medium by atomic-level collisions, and anticipated many of the potential uses of such a device.
Gould recorded his analysis and suggested applications in a laboratory notebook under the heading &quot;Some rough calculations on the feasibility of a LASER: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation&quot;—the first recorded use of this acronym. Gould&#x27;s notebook was the first written prescription for making a viable laser and, realizing what he had in hand, he took it to a neighborhood store to have his work notarized. Arthur Schawlow and Charles Townes independently discovered the importance of the Fabry–Pérot cavity—about three months later—and called the resulting proposed device an &quot;optical maser&quot;. Gould&#x27;s name for the device was first introduced to the public in a conference presentation in 1959, and was adopted despite resistance from Schawlow and his colleagues.

Eager to achieve a patent on his invention, and believing incorrectly that he needed to build a working laser to do this, Gould left Columbia without completing his doctoral degree and joined a private research company, TRG (Technical Research Group), in Long Island, New York. He convinced his new employer to support his research, and they obtained funding for the project from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, with support from Charles Townes. Unfortunately for Gould, the government declared the project classified, which meant that a security clearance was required to work on it. Because of his former participation in communist activities, Gould was unable to obtain a clearance. He continued to work at TRG, but was unable to contribute directly to the project to realize his ideas. Due to technical difficulties and perhaps Gould&#x27;s inability to participate, TRG was beaten in the race to build the first working laser by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories.

==Battles for patents==
During this time, Gould and TRG began applying for patents on the technologies Gould had developed. The first pair of applications, filed together in April 1959, covered lasers based on Fabry–Pérot optical resonators, as well as optical pumping, pumping by collisions in a gas discharge (as in helium–neon lasers), optical amplifiers, Q-switching, optical heterodyne detection, the use of Brewster&#x27;s angle windows for polarization control, and applications including manufacturing, triggering chemical reactions, measuring distance, communications, and lidar. Schawlow and Townes had already applied for a patent on the laser, in July 1958. Their patent was granted on March 22, 1960. Gould and TRG launched a legal challenge based on his 1957 notebook as evidence that Gould had invented the laser prior to Schawlow and Townes&#x27;s patent application. (At the time, the United States used a first to invent system for patents.) While this challenge was being fought in the Patent Office and the courts, further applications were filed on specific laser technologies by Bell Labs, Hughes Research Laboratories, Westinghouse, and others. Gould ultimately lost the battle for the U.S. patent on the laser itself, primarily on the grounds that his notebook did not explicitly say that the sidewalls of the laser medium were to be transparent, even though he planned to optically pump the gain medium through them, and considered loss of light through the sidewalls by diffraction. Questions were also raised about whether Gould&#x27;s notebook provided sufficient information to allow a laser to be constructed, given that Gould&#x27;s team at TRG was unable to do so. Gould was able to obtain patents on the laser in several other countries; however, he continued fighting for U.S. patents on specific laser technologies for many years afterward.

In 1967, Gould left TRG and became a professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now New York University Tandon School of Engineering. While there, he proposed many new laser applications, and arranged government funding for laser research at the institute.

Gould&#x27;s first laser patent was awarded in 1968, covering an obscure application—generating X-rays using a laser. The technology was of little value, but the patent contained all the disclosures of his original 1959 application, which had previously been secret. This allowed the patent office greater leeway to reject patent applications that conflicted with Gould&#x27;s pending patents. Meanwhile, the patent hearings, court cases, and appeals on the most significant patent applications continued, with many other inventors attempting to claim precedence for various laser technologies. The question of just how to assign credit for inventing the laser remains unresolved by historians.

By 1970, TRG had been bought by Control Data Corporation, which had little interest in lasers and was disposing of that part of the business. Gould was able to buy back his patent rights for a thousand dollars, plus a small fraction of any future profits.
In 1973, Gould left the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn to help found Optelecom, a company in Gaithersburg, Maryland that makes fiberoptic communications equipment. He later left his successful company in 1985.

==Further patent battles and enforcement of issued patents==
Shortly after starting Optelecom, Gould and his lawyers changed the focus of their patent battle. Having lost many court cases on the laser itself, and running out of appeal options, they realized that many of the difficulties could be avoided by focusing instead on the &quot;optical amplifier&quot;, an essential component of any laser. The new strategy worked, and in 1977 Gould was awarded , covering optically pumped laser amplifiers. By then, the laser industry had grown to annual sales of around $400 million, rebelled at paying royalties to license the technology they had been using for years, and fought in court to avoid paying.

The industry outcry caused the patent office to stall on releasing Gould&#x27;s other pending patents, leading to more appeals and amendments to the pending patents. Despite this, Gould was issued in 1979, covering a variety of laser applications including heating and vaporizing materials, welding, drilling, cutting, measuring distance, communication systems, television, laser photocopiers and other photochemical applications, and laser fusion. The industry responded with lawsuits seeking to avoid paying to license this patent as well. Also in 1979, Gould and his financial backers founded the company Patlex, to hold the patent rights and handle licensing and enforcement.

The legal battles continued, as the laser industry sought to not only prevent the Patent Office from issuing Gould&#x27;s remaining patents, but also to have the already-issued ones revoked. Gould and his company were forced to fight both in court, and in Patent Office review proceedings. According to Gould and his lawyers, the Office seemed determined to prevent Gould from obtaining any more patents, and to rescind the two that had been granted.

Things finally began to change in 1985. After years of legal process, the Federal Court in Washington, D.C. ordered the Patent Office to issue Gould&#x27;s patent on collisionally pumped laser amplifiers. The Patent Office appealed, but was ultimately forced to issue , and to abandon its attempts to rescind Gould&#x27;s previously issued patents. The Brewster&#x27;s angle window patent was later issued as .

The end of the Patent Office action freed Gould&#x27;s enforcement lawsuits to proceed. Finally, in 1987, Patlex won its first decisive enforcement victory, against Control Laser corporation, a manufacturer of lasers. Rather than be bankrupted by the damages and the lack of a license to the technology, the board of Control Laser turned ownership of the company over to Patlex in a settlement deal. Other laser manufacturers and users quickly agreed to settle their cases and take out licenses from Patlex on Patlex&#x27;s terms.

The thirty year patent war that it took for Gould to win the rights to his inventions became known as one of the most important patent battles in history. In the end, Gould was issued forty-eight patents, with the optical pumping, collisional pumping, and applications patents being the most important. Between them, these technologies covered most lasers used at the time. For example, the first operating laser, a ruby laser, was optically pumped; the helium–neon laser is pumped by gas discharge.

The delay—and the subsequent spread of lasers into many areas of technology—meant that the patents were much more valuable than if Gould had won initially. Even though Gould had signed away eighty percent of the proceeds to finance his court costs, he made several million dollars.

&quot;I thought that he legitimately had a right to the notion to making a laser amplifier&quot;, said William R. Bennett, who was a member of the team that built the first laser that could fire continuously. &quot;He was able to collect royalties from other people making lasers, including me.&quot;

==Election to Hall of Fame and death==
Even though his role in the invention of the laser was disputed over decades, Gould was elected to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1991.

After Gould retired in 1985, he and his wife settled in Breckenridge, Colorado, where they took long hikes and sponsored chamber music concerts, and she sang in the Colorado Symphony chorus. They eventually moved to Sag Harbor on Long Island, which was their final home.

Gould died of natural causes on September 16, 2005. He was 85. At the time of his death, Gould&#x27;s role in the invention continued to be disputed in scientific circles. Apart from the dispute, Gould had realized his hope to &quot;be around&quot; when the Brewster&#x27;s angle window patent expired in May 2005.

<text>John of Berry or John the Magnificent (French: &quot;Jean de Berry&quot;, ; 30 November 1340 – 15 June 1416) was Duke of Berry and Auvergne and Count of Poitiers and Montpensier. His brothers were King Charles V of France, Duke Louis I of Anjou and Duke Philip the Bold of Burgundy. He was Regent of France from 1380 to 1388 during the minority of his nephew Charles VI.

John is primarily remembered as a collector of the important illuminated manuscripts and other works of art commissioned by him, such as the . His personal motto was &quot;Le temps venra&quot; (&quot;the time will come&quot;).

==Biography==

John was born at the castle of Vincennes on 30 November 1340, the third son of King John II of France and Bonne of Luxembourg. In 1356, he was made Count of Poitou by his father, and in 1358 he was named king&#x27;s lieutenant of Auvergne, Languedoc, Périgord, and Poitou to administer those regions in his father&#x27;s name while the king was a captive of the English. When Poitiers was ceded to England in 1360, his father granted John the newly raised duchies of Berry and Auvergne. By the terms of the Treaty of Brétigny, signed that May, John became a hostage of the English Crown and remained in England until 1369. Upon his return to France, his brother, now King Charles V, appointed him lieutenant general for Berry, Auvergne, Bourbonnais, Forez, Sologne, Touraine, Anjou, Maine, and Normandy.

===Service as regent===
Upon the death of his older brother Charles V in 1380, the latter&#x27;s son and heir, Charles VI was a minor, so John and his brothers, along with the king&#x27;s maternal uncle the Duke of Bourbon acted as regents. He was also appointed Lieutenant General in Languedoc in November of the same year, where he was forced to deal with the Harelle, a peasants&#x27; revolt spurred by heavy taxation in support of the war effort against the English. Following the death of Louis of Anjou in 1384, John and his brother, the Duke of Burgundy, were the dominant figures in the kingdom. The king ended the regency and took power into his own hands in 1388, giving the governance of the kingdom largely to his father&#x27;s former ministers, who were political enemies of the king&#x27;s powerful uncles. John was also stripped of his offices in Languedoc at that time. John and the duke bided their time, and were soon able to retake power, in 1392, when the king had his first attack of insanity, an affliction which would remain with him throughout his life. 

In the 1390s, the dukes of Berry and Burgundy would jockey for royal favor against the Duke of Orléans, Charles VI&#x27;s brother. In April of 1401, while the Duke of Orléans was away from court, King Charles VI&#x27;s uncles made him sign the lieutenancy of Languedoc, Berry, Auvergne, and Poitou back over to Jean de Berry.

Simon of Cramaud, a canonist and prelate, served John in his efforts to find a way to end the Great Western schism that was not unfavorable to French interests.

===Later life===
In his later years, John became a more conciliatory figure in France. After the death of Philip the Bold in 1404, he was the last surviving son of King John, and generally tried to play the role of a peacemaker between the factions of his nephews Louis of Orléans and John the Fearless. After the murder of Orléans at the orders of the Duke of Burgundy, he generally took the Orléanist or Armagnac side in the civil war that erupted, but was always a moderate figure, attempting to reconcile the two sides and promote internal peace. It was largely due to John&#x27;s urging that Charles VI and his sons were not present at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Remembering his father&#x27;s fate as a captive after the Battle of Poitiers fifty-nine years before, he feared the fate of France if the king and his heirs should be taken captive and he therefore successfully prevented their participation. John died on 15 June 1416 in Paris a few months after the battle, which proved as disastrous as he had feared.

===Family and children===
John sired the following children by his first wife, Joanna of Armagnac (1346–1387), whom he married in 1360:
*Bonne of Berry (1367–1435), who succeeded him as Viscountess of Carlat and married first Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy, and then Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac.
*Charles of Berry, Count of Montpensier (1371–1383)
*Jeanne of Berry (1373–1375)
*Beatrice of Berry (April 1374)
*Marie of Berry (1375–1434), who succeeded him as Duchess of Auvergne and married first Louis III of Châtillon, then Philip of Artois, Count of Eu and finally John I, Duke of Bourbon.
*John de Valois, Count of Montpensier, (1375/1376–1397), first married Catherine of France, daughter of Charles V, King of France; and later married Anne de Bourbon.
*Louis of Berry (1383, died young)

Illegitimate son by a Scottish woman: 
*Owuoald (1370 – before 1382), born in England during John&#x27;s captivity.

In 1389 he married his second wife, Joan II, Countess of Auvergne (c.1378-1424).

==Art patron==
John of Berry was also a notable patron who commissioned works such as the most famous Book of Hours, the &quot;Très Riches Heures&quot;. &quot;Like other works produced on the duke’s auspices, this model of elegance reflected many of the artistic tendencies of the time in its fusion of Flemish realism, of the refined Parisian style, and of Italian panel-painting techniques.&quot; Admiring the artistic productions of Jean Pucelle, John employed several well-known artists such as the Limbourg Brothers, Jacquemart de Hesdin, the Master of the Brussels Initials, and André Beauneveu. His curiosity to illumination and patronage led to much success on preserving and absorbing talented miniaturist painters. His spending on his art collection severely taxed his estates, and he was deeply in debt when he died in 1416 at Paris.

Works created for him include the manuscripts known as the &quot;Très Riches Heures&quot;, the &quot;Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry&quot; and (parts of) the &quot;Turin-Milan Hours&quot;. Goldsmith&#x27;s work includes the Holy Thorn Reliquary and Royal Gold Cup, both in the British Museum.

The web site of the Louvre says of him: After the death of John&#x27;s maternal grandfather, John the Blind, during the Battle of Crecy (1346), the famed court composer and poet Guillaume de Machaut entered into the service of John of Berry.

<doc id="703618" wikidata="Q2545135" url="?curid=703618" title="Noise pop">
<text>Noise pop is a subgenre of alternative and indie rock that developed in the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom and United States. It is defined by its mixture of dissonant noise or feedback with the songcraft more often found in pop music. Shoegaze, another noise-based genre that developed in the 1980s, drew from noise pop.

== History and characteristics ==
Noise pop has been described by AllMusic as &quot;the halfway point between bubblegum and the avant-garde&quot;; the combination of conventional pop songwriting with experimental sounds of white noise, distorted guitars and drones. Accordingly, the style &quot;often has a hazy, narcotic feel, as melodies drift through the swirling guitar textures. But it can also be bright and lively, or angular and challenging.&quot; AllMusic cites the Velvet Underground as the earliest roots of the genre, with their experiments with feedback and distortion on their early albums.

Early American alternative rock bands like Sonic Youth, Yo La Tengo, Hüsker Dü, R.E.M., The Replacements and Dinosaur Jr., who mixed pop song structures with extreme guitar distortion and feedback, were immediate forerunners. The Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s 1985 debut, &quot;Psychocandy&quot;, is considered by AllMusic to be the archetype for the noise pop genre (&quot;pretty much birthed the style&quot;). Kareem Estefan of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; cited the album for &quot;transforming the use of distortion in indie rock with its screeching abrasion, yet managing to feature some of the catchiest melodies of the 80s.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Later in the 1980s, noise pop was a major inspiration for the British shoegazing movement. Influenced by The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine started to experiment with a fusion of 1960s pop music and noise on their EP, &quot;The New Record by My Bloody Valentine&quot;, paving way to their forthcoming shoegazing sound. Noise pop continued to be influential in the indie rock scene into the 1990s.

<doc id="703621" wikidata="Q181177" url="?curid=703621" title="Cranfield University">
<text>Cranfield University is a postgraduate-only public research university in the United Kingdom that specialises in science, engineering, design, technology and management. Cranfield was founded as the College of Aeronautics (CoA) in 1946. Through the 1950s and 1960s, the development of aircraft research led to growth and diversification into other areas such as manufacturing and management, and in 1967, to the founding of the Cranfield School of Management. In 1969, the College of Aeronautics was renamed the Cranfield Institute of Technology, was incorporated by royal charter, gained degree awarding powers, and became a university. In 1993, it adopted its current name.

Cranfield University has two campuses: the main campus is at Cranfield, Bedfordshire, and the second is at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom at Shrivenham, southwest Oxfordshire. The main campus is unique in the United Kingdom (and Europe) for having its own airportCranfield Airport and its own aircraft, used for teaching and research.

== History ==

===College of Aeronautics (1946–1969)===
Cranfield University was formed in 1946 as the College of Aeronautics, on the then Royal Air Force base of RAF Cranfield. A major role was played in the development of the college by Roxbee Cox, later Lord Kings Norton, who was appointed to be the first governor of the college in 1945 and then served as vice-chair and (from 1962) chair of the board. He led the drive for the college to diversify, with the Cranfield University School of Management being established in 1967, and petitioned successfully for a royal charter and degree awarding powers. When these were granted in 1969, he became the first chancellor of the Cranfield Institute of Technology, serving until 1997.

===Cranfield Institute of Technology (1969–1993)===
The Cranfield Institute of Technology was incorporated by royal charter in 1969, giving the institution its own degree-awarding powers and making it a full university in its own right.

In 1975 the National College of Agricultural Engineering, founded in 1963 at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, was merged with Cranfield and run as Silsoe College.

An academic partnership with the Royal Military College of Science (RMCS) at Shrivenham was formed in 1984. RMCS, whose roots can be traced back to 1772, is now a part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom and from 2009 has been known as &quot;Cranfield Defence and Security&quot;. RMCS became wholly postgraduate in c.2007 with undergraduate courses moved elsewhere.

=== Cranfield University (1993–present) ===
In 1993 the institution&#x27;s royal charter was amended changing its name to Cranfield University. A decade later in 2003, Cranfield became wholly postgraduate and the Shrivenham site admitted its last undergraduates.

In 2007, the university&#x27;s first international campus was opened by the Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, located in the Torrens Building in Adelaide, alongside the Carnegie Mellon University. It offered short-term postgraduate degrees in defence management and technology, in partnership with local institutions and using some distance learning courses. However South Australia&#x27;s &quot;defence boom&quot; did not materialise and its failure to attract enough students caused the closure of the campus in 2010.

In 2009, Silsoe College was closed and its activities were relocated to the main campus at Cranfield.

== Location and campus ==


Cranfield campus is approximately north of central London and adjacent to the village of Cranfield, Bedfordshire. The nearest large towns are Milton Keynes and Bedford, the centres of which are both about away. Cambridge is about east.

Shrivenham is about west of London, adjacent to Shrivenham village, from the centre of the nearest town, Swindon, and around from Oxford.

The Cranfield campus sits within the Cambridge – Milton Keynes – Oxford corridor where there are plans to link these cities and stimulate economic growth. There is also a proposal for a rapid transit system between (an expanding) Milton Keynes and the campus, although this is still at an early concept stage.

=== Technology Park ===
There are a number of companies located on the Cranfield University Technology Park ranging from large international companies to small start-ups. Major companies on the park include:

* The Nissan Technical Centre Europe, which designs and develops cars for the European market. The NTC Europe facility occupies of the Technology Park, representing an investment of £46m by Nissan.
* Innovation Centre: The Technology Park is also the location for a large number of smaller companies.

Prior to 2016:
* &quot;Trafficmaster plc&quot; occupied a site for its European Headquarters. A leading company in telematics, Trafficmaster&#x27;s advanced technology enables cars and roads to be used more efficiently.

===Milton Keynes===
Cranfield University is the academic partner in project with Milton Keynes City Council to establish a new university, code-named MK:U, in nearby Milton Keynes. The plan anticipates opening by 2023, with a campus in Central Milton Keynes. In January 2019, the partners announced an international competition to design a new campus near the Central railway station. In May 2019, Santander Bank announced a &#x27;seed funding&#x27; grant of £30 million to help with building and initial running costs. On 4 July 2019, the shortlisted proposals for the campus were announced. On 30 July 2019, the evaluation panel announced that Hopkins Architects had produced the winning design.

, the project is stalled following a government decision to deny funding.

==Coat of arms==
The university&#x27;s motto, &quot;post nubes lux&quot;, means &#x27;after clouds light&#x27;. It is depicted on the university coat of arms which was introduced when the university was awarded its royal charter.

<text>Duke of Enghien (, pronounced with a silent &quot;i&quot;) was a noble title pertaining to the House of Condé. It was only associated with the town of Enghien for a short time.

==Dukes of Enghien – first creation (1566–1569)==
The title was first conferred on Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, whose County of Enghien in modern-day Belgium was elevated to a duchy-peerage in 1566. However, the necessary registration process was not completed, so the title became extinct at his death in 1569.
In spite of this legal loophole, from 1569 to 1689 the eldest son of the Prince of Condé also held the title of Duke of Enghien. The most famous of them is Louis II, also known as the Great Condé, who held the title of Duke of Enghien from his birth in 1621 to his father&#x27;s death in 1646.

==Dukes of Enghien – second creation (1689–1830)==
His grandson Henry II, Prince of Condé, inherited the Duchy of Montmorency near Paris in 1633, and in 1689 the Duchy of Montmorency was renamed as Duchy of Enghien for his son Louis II, Prince of Condé. The title Duke of Enghien was thereafter used as a courtesy title for the eldest son of the Prince of Condé.

# 1689–1709: Henri I, Duke of Enghien (1643–1709)
# 1709–1710: Louis I, Duke of Enghien (1668–1710)
# 1710–1740: Louis II Henri, Duke of Enghien (1692–1740)
# 1740–1818: Louis III Joseph, Duke of Enghien (1736–1818)
# 1818–1830: Louis IV Henri, Duke of Enghien (1756–1830)

Most often it refers to Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé, duc d&#x27;Enghien (1772–1804), the son of Louis Henry II, whose execution on trumped-up charges in 1804 during the French Consulate removed any hope of reconciliation between Napoleon Bonaparte and the House of Bourbon. The duke was executed in the moat of the Château de Vincennes.

On the death of the last duke in 1830, the title passed to Louis Philippe III, Duke of Orléans, a great-great-grandson of the Louis I, Duke of Enghien through the female line. He had become King of the French as Louis Philippe I a month earlier.

<text>The Phonodeik is a sound recording apparatus invented by Dayton Miller in 1908. The Phonodeik converts sound waves into visual images. The name was suggested by Edward W. Morley. Before electronic oscilloscopes, this device was used for analyzing sound waves. The Phonodeik can be modified to project sound waves on a screen for public demonstration.

==Description==

The Phonodeik used photographic material to record sound. A diaphragm receiver of thin glass is at the end of a resonator horn. Behind the diaphragm is a steel pulley spindle mounted in jeweled bearings with an attached mirror and oscillating tension spring. Wrapped on the pulley spindle are thin silk fibers or platinum wire turning around the mirror with amplitude. The sound vibrates the diaphragm on the bottom and a light beam is reflected to the sensitive photographic paper (or a projection screen).

<doc id="703638" wikidata="Q132098" url="?curid=703638" title="Xiphophorus">
<text>Xiphophorus is a genus of euryhaline and freshwater fishes in the family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes, native to Mexico and northern Central America. &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; species can be divided into 3 groups based on their evolutionary relationships: platyfish (or platies), northern swordtails, and southern swordtails. Platyfish formerly were classified in another genus, &quot;Platypoecilus&quot;, which is now obsolete. The type species is &quot;X. hellerii,&quot; the green swordtail. Like most other new world Poeciliids, platies and swordtails are live-bearers that use internal fertilization and give birth to live young instead of laying eggs like the bulk of the world&#x27;s fishes. The name &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; derives from the Greek words ξίφος (dagger) and φόρος (bearer), referring to the gonopodium on the males. All are relatively small fishes, which reach a maximum length of depending on the exact species involved.

==Distribution and conservation status==
The various &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; species range from the southern Rio Grande basin in Mexico, through eastern drainages in the country (river basins draining into the Gulf of Mexico), to northern Guatemala, Belize and northern Honduras.

Three species and their hybrids are common in the aquarium trade: the green swordtail (&quot;X. hellerii&quot;), the southern platyfish (&quot;X. maculatus&quot;) and the variable platyfish (&quot;X. variatus&quot;). These three are the only species that have large native ranges. They have also been introduced outside their native range (in Mexico, Central America, and other continents) where they sometimes become invasive and outcompete and endanger native species, including other, more localized members of &quot;Xiphophorus&quot;.

All other species of &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; are highly localized and mostly endemic to Mexico. Only three of the localized species, the Chiapas swordtail (&quot;X. alvarezi&quot;), &quot;X. mayae&quot; and &quot;X. signum&quot;, range outside Mexico and the last two are the only &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; species not found in Mexico at all. In many locations there are two or more sympatric species, but the localized species are mostly (though not entirely) separated from each other, even when they are restricted to the same river basin. This includes three restricted species in the Rio Grande basin (all fully separated), nine restricted species in the Pánuco River basin (mostly separated) and three restricted species in the Coatzacoalcos River basin (mostly separated).

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the spiketail platyfish (&quot;X. andersi&quot;) and northern platyfish (&quot;X. gordoni&quot;) as Endangered, while the Monterrey platyfish (&quot;X. couchianus&quot;) and marbled swordtail (&quot;X. meyeri&quot;) are listed as Extinct in the wild, and thus only survive in captivity. In addition to those, Mexican authorities recognize the yellow swordtail (&quot;X. clemenciae&quot;) and Catemaco platyfish (&quot;Xiphophorus milleri&quot;) as threatened. Almost all the &quot;Xiphophorus&quot;, including the rare species, have captive populations that are maintained as &quot;insurance&quot; populations at breeding centers and by dedicated private aquarists.

==Human uses==
&quot;Xiphophorus&quot; species are regularly used in genetic studies, and scientists have developed many interspecific hybrids. Xiphophorus have proved a useful model to understand the consequences of hybridization, especially in the context of melanoma research since the 1920s. The Xiphophorus Genetic stock center, founded by Myron Gordon in 1939, is an important source of these fish for research.

In addition, several species are commonly kept by aquarium hobbyists, especially the green swordtail (&quot;X. helleri&quot;), southern platyfish (&quot;X. maculatus&quot;), and variable platyfish (&quot;X. variatus&quot;). In fact, these three species comprise one of the most prominent groups of aquarium species, being part of a group of extremely hardy livebearing fish, alongside the molly and guppy, that can adjust to a wide range of conditions within the aquarium. Unlike some species, these are almost always offered as captive bred individuals due to the ease of breeding these livebearers.

In captivity, they will coexist with many other fish species, although in an aquarium with too many males and not enough females, fighting can ensue between males of the same species. They can also easily jump out of an inadequately covered aquarium.

== Species and taxonomy ==

There are currently 28 recognized species in this genus, according to FishBase. Two of these species, &quot;X. clemenciae&quot; and &quot;X. monticolus&quot;, are likely the result of natural hybrid speciation (ancestors of both are a platy species and a swordtail species). Two other proposed species, &quot;X. kosszanderi&quot; and &quot;X. roseni&quot;, are recognized by FishBase, but not by all other authorities, as the first appears to be a hybrid between &quot;X. variatus&quot; and &quot;X. xiphidium&quot;, and the second between &quot;X. variatus&quot; and &quot;X. couchianus&quot; (&quot;X. kosszanderi&quot; and &quot;X. roseni&quot; have not undergone speciation as in &quot;X. clemenciae&quot; and &quot;X. monticolus&quot;). Contemporary hybridization in the wild was thought to be uncommon in this genus until recently.

Although traditionally divided into swordtails and platies, this separation is not supported by phylogenetic studies, which have shown that the swordtails are paraphyletic compared with the platies. These studies suggest that the genus can be divided into three monophyletic groups: the northern swordtails (of the Pánuco River basin, marked with a star* in the list), southern swordtails (southern Mexico to Honduras) and the platies. The common names given to individual species in this genus do not always reflect their actual relationships; for example, the marbled swordtail (&quot;X. meyeri&quot;) is actually in the platy group based on its genetics while the short-sword platyfish (&quot;X. continens&quot;) is closer to the swordtails.

==Research==

Hybridization: &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; is a leading animal model systems in the study of hybridization between species. In particular, studies in &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; provided some early evidence that recombination controlled patterns of ancestry in hybrid genomes. An interesting consequence of hybridization is the origin of spontaneous melanoma in hybrids. For example, in the well-studied Gordon-Kosswig cross between &quot;X. maculatus&quot; and &quot;X. hellerii&quot;, hybrids develop spontaneous melanoma due to an interaction between the oncogene xmrk and a repressor locus on a distinct chromosome.

Pigmentation: &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; pigmentation has been investigated since the 1920s using classical genetics techniques such as crosses. As a result, inheritance patterns of many traits have been described. More recently, researchers have identified specific genes and even mutations causing pigment pattern variation (for instance, a spot allowing males to mimic females) and investigated selective mechanisms on these traits.

Sexual selection: Researchers since Darwin have studied &quot;Xiphophorus&quot; species for their sexually selected ornaments (e.g. caudal fin &quot;swords&quot;). More recent studies have focused on male ornamentation, courtship strategies, and female mate choice.

<text>The University of Derby, formerly known as Derby College, is a public university in the city of Derby, England. It traces its history back to the establishment of the Derby Diocesan Institution for the Training of Schoolmistresses in 1851. It gained university status in 1992.

The university provides over 300 study programmes at undergraduate level. Undergraduate programmes as well as short courses, foundation degrees and postgraduate degrees cover most academic disciplines and sub-disciplines. Currently, the university is home to around 34,000 students in all areas of study.

==History==

===Nineteenth century===
Over the years, two dozen bodies have contributed to the university&#x27;s formation. The first of these was founded in 1856 as the Derby Diocesan Institution for the Training of Schoolmistresses. Albeit under different names to reflect maturing objectives, the institution flourished as an individual entity for some 120 years before merging with another developing educational artery to help form what was then known as the Derby Lonsdale College of Higher Education, 1977.

The other line of this confluence began in 1853 with the establishment of the Derby School of Art, which in 1870 became the Derby Central School of Art and the Derby Central School of Science. In 1885, the two schools were reformulated into the Derby School of Art and Technical Institution. Less than a decade later, however, in 1892, three more mergers took place and the institution became the Derby Municipal Technical College.

===Early twentieth century===
In 1928, the Technical College split into the Derby School of Art and the Derby Technical College. By 1955, the two had become the Derby and District College of Art (opened on 22 September 1966 by Paul Reilly, Director of the Council of Industrial Design), and the Derby and District College of Technology (opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 15 May 1964), both situated on Kedleston Road, Allestree. The site was formerly Markeaton Golf Course and cost £2.5m, with a foundation stone placed on 5 July 1957 by Lord (Ernest) Hives, a former managing director of Rolls-Royce. Opened by the Duke the day before, the Bishop Lonsdale College in Mickleover was developed for teacher training courses.

At the opening ceremony, the duke said &quot;qualities needed by teachers are the dedication of a saint, the patience of a watchmaker, the sympathy of parents, and the leadership of a general&quot;. The Duke spent two days in Derby, staying the night nearby at Okeover Hall near Ashbourne as a guest of the Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. Half of the places at Mickleover were reserved for C of E trainees and the other half for those with no link to Derby Diocese.

===1970–1992: Mergers of higher education colleges in Derbyshire===
The operational split between the two colleges at Kedleston Road was dissolved in 1972 with a mutual initiative for the creation of the Derby College of Art and Technology. Five years afterwards, and as previously noted, the described educational lineage married itself with Derby&#x27;s diocesan tradition, which had become known institutionally as the Bishop Lonsdale College of Education at Mickleover. There were about 800 students at Mickleover and 1,200 at Kedleston Road.

After the 1977 union and subsequent formation of the Derby Lonsdale College of Higher Education, four other educational institutions would add their respective sector-related talents. In March 1981, the college held its first graduation ceremony with formal academic caps and gowns with only six degrees (out of 156 courses) being ratified by the CNAA. Previous to this, the college&#x27;s degrees were awarded in a ceremony at the University of Nottingham.

The Matlock College of Education, a traditional local education authority teacher training college formed in 1946 at Rockside Hall (now a country hotel), combined with Lonsdale in 1983 to create the Derbyshire College of Higher Education, when the Matlock College was having financial difficulties when funding for teacher training was scaled down when school numbers had dropped. In 1985, this college at Matlock was scaled down significantly and closed in 1986. In 1991 the Southern Derbyshire School of Occupational Therapy united with the college. The Southern Derbyshire School of Radiography did the same in 1992.

===1992–1997: Achievement of university status===
In 1992 the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 allowed the Derbyshire College of Higher Education to become the only school of higher education in the country to be upgraded directly to a university. On 31 October 1992, the T block (science subjects, which lies to the north of the North Tower) was opened by Princess Alice.

In January 1994, Britannia Mill (a renovated mill) opened, at a cost of £10M. On 4 March 1994, the B block (business and management subjects, which lies north of the East Tower) was opened by the Conservative MP, Tim Boswell.

Later in the autumn of 1994, the Atrium was built. In November 1997, the Learning Centre (now renamed ‘University Library’) was officially opened, having been built on a former car park. The University of Derby was fully invested.

===1998–present: New campuses and further mergers===
In 1998, the university merged with High Peak College of Further Education in Buxton, which is in the North West of the County of Derbyshire. High Peak College was at that time based at premises in Harpur Hill, but moved to the Devonshire Dome in the centre of Buxton in 2005.

In August 2012, the university merged with Leek College in Leek, Staffordshire. In 2013 the university merged all of its further education education provision into Buxton &amp; Leek College. The college operates at the university&#x27;s campuses in Buxton, Leek, and Kedleston Road in Derby.

In October 2016, the university opened a new site in Chesterfield in the North-East of the County of Derbyshire. This is situated in the buildings of what was originally St Helena&#x27;s Grammar School, which were converted by the university.

In 2021, the university withdrew its Higher Education provision from the Buxton campus leaving just Buxton and Leek Colleges operating in Buxton.

In 2022, the university opened the Nuclear Skills Academy in partnership with Rolls Royce Submarines Ltd. with the intention of 200 new apprentices being trained for the next 10 years.

==Campuses and facilities==

The university has a range of resources and facilities available to all students and staff, including lecture theatres; Union of Students&#x27; facilities; a bus service operating at and between the campuses; Chaplaincy and facilities for faith, meditation and prayer; indoor and outdoor sports facilities; cafes and food outlets; wellbeing centres and support; Careers and Employability services and centres; and a University Library service

===Derby===

The university&#x27;s main campus is in the city of Derby. The Kedleston Road site in Allestree, in the north-west of Derby, is the largest and main campus and serves as the university&#x27;s headquarters. It is situated close to the A38 and opposite Markeaton Park. A contemporary-styled building for Arts, Design, and Media, as well as a STEM building, on &quot;Markeaton Street&quot; in Derby, was formally opened in early November 2007 by Richard Branson. Courses are also run at the Britannia Mill site in Derby.

In addition, the university also owns Derby Theatre in Derby city centre where courses in Theatre Arts are delivered. Derby Law School and the Department of Law, Criminology and Social Sciences operate at the One Friar Gate Square building in the centre of Derby

The Derby Campus also has a variety of specialist facilities, including computing laboratories, two computer games development suites, a doctor&#x27;s surgery, conference facilities, multi-functional lecture theatres, art and culture venues, concert venues, recording studios, sports centre and fitness suites, outdoor pitches, student union facilities, and a multi-faith centre.

===Buxton===
This campus was located in the Grade II* listed 18th-century former stable block, the Devonshire Dome. In 1854, the 6th Duke of Devonshire donated the land, part of his stables, and some of the funds for conversion to a hospital and gardens for charity patients seeking treatment at the baths in Buxton. His architect, Henry Currey, directed the work. The ironwork dome (1881, once the world&#x27;s largest, with a diameter of ), a clocktower (1882), and a surgical ward (1897) were built as expansions to the hospital, which was run by the NHS after 1948. The University of Derby purchased the then-derelict hospital from the NHS in 2001, and moved operations here from the Harpur Hill campus in 2005. The Devonshire Dome building dominates the local landscape and has a dome which is over in diameter, bigger than that of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. It was formally opened as a University Campus by Prince Charles in February 2006.

The university formally withdrew its Higher Education provision from the Buxton campus in 2021 and moved all courses to the Derby Campus with culinary arts, spa management, and outdoor leadership courses terminated. 2021 also saw the permanent closure of its student accommodation, High Peak Halls, in Buxton due to the aforementioned move. The Buxton campus therefore now only operates as a college and not a university campus.
===Chesterfield===
The university&#x27;s teaching site in Chesterfield is situated in the buildings of what was originally St Helena&#x27;s Grammar School, off Sheffield Road, near Chesterfield town centre. The buildings were extensively renovated by the university between 2014 and 2016, after being acquired by the University of Derby in 2014.

The new teaching site opened in October 2016 to be a delivery site for the College of Health, Psychology, and Social Care, including their nationally recognised Adult Nursing degrees and Mentoring in Practice courses, replacing existing premises in the Chesterfield Chamber of Commerce building. These courses are accredited by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. They continue the university&#x27;s training work in collaboration with Chesterfield Royal Hospital, and the building features a mock ward and &#x27;clinical skills suite&#x27; with simulated patients to provide real-world experience for undergraduates.

===Leek===
The Leek campus is a delivery site for Buxton &amp; Leek College. The campus mainly runs Further and Adult Education courses, but also runs some degree programmes validated by the University of Derby.

===International partnerships===
The university does not have any campuses abroad but instead partners with institutions around the world, which deliver and award University of Derby degrees.

Current international collaborations include Botswana Accountancy College, Vakalo Art &amp; Design College, Mediterranean College, Raffles Design Institute, Swiss Hotel Management School, Culinary Arts Academy Switzerland and Help Academy.

<text>Hallands Nyheter is a Swedish newspaper, founded by Artur Lagerihn in 1905. The newspaper is published in Falkenberg. It has a daily circulation of 31,600 and is owned by Stampen AB. The editorial page supports Centerpartiet. It is printed six days a week, daily except Sunday.

The paper employs about 150 people and has annual revenue of 130 million Swedish kronor. Bengt Wendle is the CEO, while AnnaKarin Lith is chief editor. It is mainly distributed in the municipalities of Falkenberg and Varberg, where over 70% of the households subscribe. The paper has editorial offices in Falkenberg, Varberg, Kungsbacka and Halmstad. It is distributed as a talking magazine as well.

Stampen AB bought it from Centertidningar AB in 2005. Originally published under the label &quot;Falkenbergs-Posten&quot;, it changed its name to &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot; in 1919.

==History==
The newspaper started as &quot;Falkenbergs-Posten&quot; and was initially an advertising brochure. It was set up by a printer, Artur Lagerihn, who published the first issue on 2 October 1905. Before that, he had printed three specimen copies, starting on 13 September. The paper changed form to become a usual newspaper after just a few copies. It was then printed three times a week: Mondays; Wednesdays and Fridays. The paper had four pages. It was distributed by post on the countryside, while townspeople could either get it at specified places, or pay a bit extra and get it delivered. &quot;Falkenbergs-Posten&quot; was a liberal paper, in opposition to its competitor, the large &quot;Falkenbergs Tidning&quot;, which was conservative.

Nils Bierke become joint owner on 18 December. He was the chief editor of the paper during two periods, until 1909. The paper suffered from bad finances and in 1907 it became a corporation. Several of the town&#x27;s businessmen bought shares and become board members. In 1908 Artur Lagerihn got sick and Gustav Adolf Janson (usually written Gustav Ad. Janson) took over the authorization to issue the newspaper. Nils Bierke left the paper. On 4 January it started to use modern Swedish spelling. The financial problems were however still there. In 1909 it issued preference shares, that was however not enough, and the paper had to declare bankruptcy

===Reconstruction===
The paper was reconstructed by three of its former owners: A T Törngren; Julius Månsson and A Andersson. The first copy was printed on 26 November 1909. Filip Pärson held the post as chief editor, and would continue to do so until 1927.

In November 1911, Filip Pärson&#x27;s wife, Tekla Pärson, took over as owner together with Gustav Ad. Jansson. Filip could himself not stand as owner as he had been involved in an earlier bankruptcy. From 1912 the paper would be published at Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The reason for the change was that it fitted better with the post distribution, and the days were those on which &quot;Falkenbergs Tidning&quot; was published as well.

===The farmer&#x27;s movement gets involved===
The recently formed National Farmers Union (Jordbrukarnas Riksförbund) want a newspaper in Halland. At the annual meeting on 28 May 1919 it was decided that the possibility of getting a mean of influencing the press in Halland should be investigated. As a consequence a company, owned by individuals within the farmer&#x27;s movement, bought the paper. The goal was to make it a paper of the entire county.

In December 1919, the paper therefore changed its name to &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot; (&quot;News of Halland&quot;). The paper had until then been a paper of the countryside of Falkenberg Municipality. It would take considerable time before that would to start to change. In the town Falkenbergs, Tidning still ruled.

A few years after the takeover, it became formally owned by the Farmers&#x27; League, a successor of the National Farmers Union. By becoming owned by the farmer&#x27;s movement the paper not only got more money into the company, it also gained from the contact net of the movement to receive news.

The financial situation did however continue to be worrying. They did not succeed in widening is distribution area. As of 1926 it had a circulation of 2,000. This led the Farmer&#x27;s League to sell the paper back to its CEO and former owner, Gustaf Adolf Janson. Janson not only got ownership of the paper, he became the new editor in chief. A deal was struck between Janson and the farmer&#x27;s movement. The movement promised to continue to support the paper by subscribing, advertising etc. if the paper continued wear their stamp.

The company saw a turn for the better when the printer was commissioned to print Halländska Lantmannatidningen the same year. Although small in size it had, in the 1940s, a circulation of 20,000, hence giving the company a much needed stable source of income. The financial situation was brightened further when it was commissioned to print &quot;SLU-bladet&quot; in 1930. &quot;SLU-bladet&quot; was the membership paper of the Farmer&#x27;s League&#x27;s youth organisation.

===The paper establish itself in Varberg===
Starting 12 August 1930 the paper was printed by a new printer, replacing one used from the foundation. In 1931 it started printing on Mondays, hence printing four editions a week. The move was caused by a similar move taken by &quot;Falkenbergs Tidning&quot; a year earlier.

Another important change occurred the same year. The paper established a new editorial office in the neighboring town of Varberg. After a tough start, it grew partly because of the local editor in chief, Axel E Blixt, a man with good connections with the farmer&#x27;s movement. Pressure from the farmer&#x27;s movement had been the deciding factor behind the expansion.

The &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot;, as well as the farmer&#x27;s movement, had been offered to buy one of the newspapers in the town, &quot;Norra Hallands Tidning Vestkusten&quot;. Neither the paper, nor the movement, were interested. The new office did have some tough first years, as the Union of Merchants boycotted the new paper until 1937. The paper continued to grow, especially on the surrounding countryside. It has held a dominating position in Varberg since the 1970s.

The paper was distributed six days a week from 1939. The paper switch from mid day to morning publication in response to the same move by &quot;Falkenbergs Tidning&quot;. The circulation increased, as of 1939 it was 7,295 copies, six years later it was 10,825.

The paper bought a new printer in 1943. The purchase fueled some controversy, as it originally belonged to a Norwegian paper that had been taken over by the Nazis during the war, &quot;Bergens Aftenblad&quot;. &quot;Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning&quot;, &quot;Göteborgs-Posten&quot; and &quot;Falkenbergs Tidning&quot; all hinted that they had been able to buy the printer at a too low price, as Norway was occupied by Germany.

The old one was sold to &quot;Laholms tidning&quot;. A close cooperation between the papers was established, much due to the shared connection with the farmer&#x27;s movement. The papers shared came to share a lot of their content with other.

While &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot; did well during the war and the years that followed, the same was not true for its competitors. &quot;Norra Hallands Tidning Vestkusten&quot; and &quot;Varbergs Posten&quot;, located in Varberg, as well as &quot;Falkenbergs Tidning&quot;, were all shut down and replaced by another conservative paper, &quot;Hallands Dagblad&quot;. That paper in turn shut down in 1959. The growth of &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot; meant that the political profile was softened.

===Technical development and new owners===
The paper bought a cliché machine in 1954. The machine meant that they could print much more photos, and in 1956 the paper got its first full-time employed photograph. The same year a teleprinter was installed. In 1964 the paper brought a new printer, this time from a Danish paper, &quot;Næstved Tidende&quot;. The printer was put into use in 1966.

&quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot; was reorganised as a joint stock company in 1958. Gustav Ad. Janson continued to be the majority shareholder, while his wife and children became the owners of the remaining stocks. When Janson died in 1963, his son Gustav Janson took over as CEO, while Thure Mattsson became the chief editor.

Between 1962 and 1966 (and later from 1980 and 1989) the paper had a local office in Getinge. By 1965 an office was opened in Halmstad and in 1966 another office was opened in Kungsbacka. By the late 1960s and the 1970s the paper&#x27;s finances worsened. Centertidningar AB bought a majority stake in the company in 1975. Arvid Johansson took over as chief editor 1977.

The paper begun with phototypesetting and direct lithography in 1977. A new printer was bought in 1981. Following the new printer the format was changed to berliner and the office was upgraded, to be able to handle the introduction of computers. Failed negotiations on a shared printer were held with &quot;Hallandsposten&quot;.

Until 1982, &quot;Halland Nyheter&quot; had advertisements on its front page. The same year, the office in Varberg moved to new facilities, while a new office was opened in Fegen. In 1986 the paper bought another local printing company, ABC-tryck. The company started to print &quot;Laholms tidning&quot; in 1988. In 1989, for the first time, more than 30,000 copies of &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot; were distributed.

The owner was Stampen, which bought Centertidningar AB (including &quot;Hallands Nyheter&quot;) in 2005. Starting from 27 February 2007 the paper is printed in Halmstad in tabloid format. The paper is part of Mediebolaget Västkusten, MBVK, and its sister newspaper is &quot;Hallandsposten&quot;.

<doc id="703647" wikidata="Q1018322" url="?curid=703647" title="Buz Lukens">
<text>Donald Edgar &quot;Buz&quot; Lukens (February 11, 1931 – May 22, 2010) was a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio. His political career ended in 1990 when he was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Six years later, he was convicted for accepting a bribe during his time in Congress.

==Early years==
Lukens was born at Harveysburg, Ohio. He attended schools in Harveysburg and graduated from high school in Waynesville, Ohio. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio in 1954. After finishing college, Lukens joined the U.S. Air Force, reaching the rank of captain after six-and-a-half years of active duty. Remaining a member of the Air Force Reserve, in 1961 Lukens accepted a job as minority counsel for the Republican staff of the House Rules Committee.

==Political career==
Lukens was president of the national Young Republicans in the early 1960s.

In 1966, Lukens won a seat in the United States House of Representatives, defeating Democrat James H. Pelley. He began serving in the House in 1967 (90th Congress). In 1968, Lukens won re-election, defeating Democrat Lloyd D. Miller. Lukens chose not to run again for the House seat in 1970. Instead, he made a run for Governor of Ohio. However, Lukens was defeated in the Republican primary by Roger Cloud, who went on to lose the general election to Democrat John J. Gilligan.

Lukens was a supporter of California Governor Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign for the Republican nomination for president in 1968.

Lukens then was appointed to the Ohio State Senate, serving from 1971 to 1986. In 1986, Tom Kindness, who held Lukens’ old seat, opted to challenge U.S. Senator John Glenn rather than run for re-election. Lukens sought to take back his old seat, and defeated perennial Democratic candidate John W. Griffin. Lukens started serving this term in 1987 (101st Congress). In 1988, Lukens won re-election, defeating Griffin once again.

==Sex scandals and resignation==
On February 1, 1989, an Ohio television station caught Lukens on camera at a Columbus, Ohio, McDonald&#x27;s restaurant talking with the mother of a teenage girl, and openly discussing his sexual relationship with the girl. Soon afterward, a grand jury brought charges against him of contributing to the delinquency of a minor because of allegations that he paid the girl $40 and gifts in exchange for sex when she was 16 years old. Further allegations had been made that the relationship with the girl began when she was 13, but a grand jury declined to pursue further charges against Lukens beyond a single charge of &quot;contributing to the delinquency of a minor&quot;.

On June 30, 1989, a jury in the Franklin County Juvenile Court convicted Lukens of the misdemeanor crimes of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and contributing to the unruliness of a minor for paying $40 to the girl for sex in his Columbus apartment on November 6, 1988. A friend of the girl&#x27;s, a 19-year-old, accompanied her that day, but was not directly involved. The judge set aside the conviction on the first charge but upheld the second, for which Lukens received the maximum penalty, 180 days in jail and a fine of $1,000. The judge suspended all but 30 days in jail and half the fine, and ordered Lukens to attend sex offender programs and be tested for venereal diseases. Bond was set at $100,000, which the judge declared &quot;eminently reasonable for a man with no remorse whatsoever.&quot;

Though Ohio&#x27;s age of consent is 16, Lukens&#x27; conviction was under a misdemeanor statute that states that &quot;no person shall... aid, abet, induce, cause, encourage, or contribute to a child or ward of the juvenile court (into) becoming an unruly or (delinquent) child.&quot;

Lukens made an unsuccessful appeal to the Franklin County Court of Appeals. Of particular contention was the fact that the girl had a considerable juvenile delinquency record (which included curfew violations, running away, and petty theft), but this record (as well as a psychiatric report) was ruled inadmissible. She lived with her mother, but was a ward of the Juvenile Court. Lukens&#x27; defense was that the juvenile record would show that the girl was already a delinquent and not a reliable witness. The reliability of her testimony was already under attack, as there were significant testimony inconsistencies, a fact conceded by County Prosecutor Michael Miller.

Refusing to resign from his seat despite the demands of the Republican leadership, Lukens lost the 1990 Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—to state representative John Boehner, who would later become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

On October 23, 1990, the House Ethics Committee voted to investigate charges that Lukens had fondled and propositioned a Capitol elevator operator. Realizing his position was untenable, Lukens resigned from Congress on October 24, 1990. In January 1991 he served nine days of the 30-day jail sentence handed down in 1989.

==House banking scandal==
In 1995, the task force investigating the House banking scandal charged him with five counts of bribery and conspiracy related to actions he took while in Congress. He was accused of accepting a bribe of $15,000. He was convicted in March 1996 after a second trial, and sentenced to 30 months in prison.

==Personal life and death==
Lukens married Toshiko Shirley Jane Davis, a model 21 years his junior, in Columbus, Ohio in June 1973. They divorced in 1983. Lukens died of cancer in Dallas, Texas in 2010 at the age of 79.
