<text>Recreational fishing, also called sport fishing or game fishing, is fishing for leisure, exercise or competition. It can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is professional fishing for profit; or subsistence fishing, which is fishing for survival and livelihood.

The most common form of recreational fishing is angling, which is done with a rig of rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits, as well as other complementary devices such as weights, floats, swivels and method feeders, collectively referred to as &quot;terminal tackles&quot;. Lures are frequently used instead of fresh bait when fishing for predatory fishes. Some hobbyists hand-make custom tackles themselves, including plastic lures and artificial flies.

Other forms of recreational fishing include spearfishing, which is done with a speargun or harpoon usually while diving; and bowfishing, which is done from above the water with archery equipments such as a compound bow or crossbow. Noodling and trout tickling are recreational fishing activities that uses hands to catch fish. There are also fishing techniques that uses nets, traps and other unconventional tools such as snag hook, sledgehammer and even boomerang, although inhumane or destructive fishing practices are generally discouraged and some are outright banned in most countries.

Popular fish species pursued by recreational fishermen are collectively known as game fishes. Big-game fishing, which targets large open-water fishes such as tuna, billfishes (marlins and swordfish), grouper and shark, is typically conducted from yachts, although some are also done from the shore by casting far into the waves. Although the caught fish can be consumed as food, catch and release is often encouraged for conservation purposes.
==History==

The early evolution of fishing as a recreation is not clear, but there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan as early as the 9th century BCE, and Claudius Aelianus (175–235 CE) describes fly fishing in Europe in his work &quot;On the Nature of Animals&quot;.

For the early Japanese and Macedonians, however, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. It is possible that antecedents of recreational fly fishing arrived in England with the Norman conquest of 1066. Although the point in history where fishing could first be said to be recreational is not clear, it is clear that recreational fishing had fully arrived with the publication of &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;.

The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, shortly after the invention of the printing press. The authorship of this was attributed to Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery. The essay was titled &quot;Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle&quot;, and was published in the second &quot;Boke of Saint Albans&quot;, a treatise on hawking, hunting and heraldry. These were major interests of the nobility, and the publisher, Wynkyn de Worde, was concerned that the book should be kept from those who were not gentlemen, since their immoderation in angling might &quot;utterly destroy it&quot;.

During the 16th century the work was much read, and was reprinted many times. &quot;Treatyse&quot; includes detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies. It also includes modern concerns about conservation and angler etiquette.

The earliest English poetical treatise on angling, &quot;The Secrets of Angling&quot; by John Dennys (who was said to have been a fishing companion of Shakespeare), was published in 1613. Footnotes of the work, written by Dennys&#x27; editor William Lawson, make the first mention of the phrase to &quot;cast a fly&quot;: &quot;The trout gives the most gentlemanly and readiest sport of all, if you fish with an artificial fly, a line twice your rod&#x27;s length of three hairs&#x27; thickness... and if you have learnt the cast of the fly.&quot;

In a United States context, The Outdoor Industry Association, states that fishing participation has continued its 11-year upward trajectory, adding 300,000 participants and reaching its highest number of participants since 2007. At the same time, the participation rate dipped slightly by 0.1%, bringing the fishing rate to 16.4%. This was due to the increasing population of the United States. 

The &quot;Leaky Bucket&quot; illustrates the annual churn of fishing participants, or those people joining/rejoining the activity and those quitting in a given year. From 2017 to 2018, there was significant churn in fishing participation. While 9.1 million people stopped fishing, 9.4 million started. All of this change led to a fairly high churn rate of 18.5%, but also resulted in a net gain of 300,000 fishing participants. 

In 2018 participants spent a collective 883 million days fishing, averaging 17.9 annual fishing days per person. These average outing were done by an average of 2.1% over the past 3 years. 

===Development===

Recreational fishing took a great leap forward after the English Civil War, where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time. The renowned officer in the Parliamentary army, Robert Venables, published in 1662 &quot;The Experienced Angler, or Angling improved, being a general discourse of angling, imparting many of the aptest ways and choicest experiments for the taking of most sorts of fish in pond or river&quot;. Another Civil War veteran to enthusiastically take up fishing, was Richard Franck. He was the first to describe salmon fishing in Scotland, and both in that and trout-fishing with artificial fly he was a practical angler. He was the first angler to name the burbot, and commended the salmon of the River Thames.
&quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; was written by Izaak Walton in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the Derbyshire Wye. It was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse; 6 verses were quoted from John Dennys&#x27;s earlier work. A second part to the book was added by Walton&#x27;s friend Charles Cotton. More than 300 editions of &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; have been published. The pastoral discourse was enriched with country fishing folklore, songs and poems, recipes and anecdotes, moral meditations, and quotes from classic literature. The central character, Piscator, champions the art of angling, but with an air of tranquility also relishes the pleasures of friendship, verse and song, and good food and drink.
Cotton&#x27;s additions completed the instruction in fly fishing and advised on the making of artificial flies where he listed sixty five varieties. Charles Kirby designed an improved fishing hook in 1655 that remains relatively unchanged to this day. He went on to invent the Kirby bend, a distinctive hook with an offset point, still commonly used today.

During the 18th century, the fishing industry became commercialized - rods and tackle were sold at the haberdashers store. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, artisans moved to Redditch which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his trading shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century. He received a Royal Warrant from three successive monarchs starting with King George IV.

Some have credited Onesimus with the invention of the multiplying winch, although he was certainly the first to advertise its sale. Early multiplying reels were wide and had a small diameter, and their gears, made of brass, often wore down after extensive use. His earliest advertisement in the form of a trading card date from 1768 and was entitled &quot;To all lovers of angling&quot;. A full list of the tackles he sold included artificial flies, and &#x27;the best sort of multiplying brass winches both stop and plain&#x27;. The commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the aristocracy.

===Expansion===

British fly-fishing continued to develop in the 19th century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques. Alfred Ronalds took up the sport of fly fishing, learning the craft on the rivers Trent, Blythe and Dove. On the River Blythe, near what is today Creswell Green, Ronalds constructed a bankside fishing hut designed primarily as an observatory of trout behaviour in the river. From this hut, and elsewhere on his home rivers, Ronalds conducted experiments and formulated the ideas that eventually were published in &quot;The Fly-fisher&#x27;s Entomology&quot; in 1836.
He combined his knowledge of fly fishing with his skill as an engraver and printer, to lavish his work with 20 colour plates. It was the first comprehensive work related to the entomology associated with fly fishing and most fly-fishing historians credit Ronalds with setting a literature standard in 1836 that is still followed today. Describing methods, techniques and, most importantly, artificial flies, in a meaningful way for the angler and illustrating them in colour is a method of presentation that can be seen in most fly-fishing literature today.

By the mid to late 19th century, expanding leisure opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or to rivers for fishing. Richer hobbyists ventured further abroad. The large rivers of Norway replete with large stocks of salmon began to attract fishers from England in large numbers in the middle of the century - &quot;Jones&#x27;s guide to Norway, and salmon-fisher&#x27;s pocket companion&quot;, published in 1848, was written by Frederic Tolfrey and was a popular guide to the country.

In southern England, dry-fly fishing acquired an elitist reputation as the only acceptable method of fishing the slower, clearer rivers of the south such as the River Test and the other chalk streams concentrated in Hampshire, Surrey, Dorset and Berkshire (see Southern England Chalk Formation for the geological specifics). The weeds found in these rivers tend to grow very close to the surface, and it was felt necessary to develop new techniques that would keep the fly and the line on the surface of the stream. These became the foundation of all later dry-fly developments.

However, there was nothing to prevent the successful employment of wet flies on these chalk streams, as G. E. M. Skues proved with his nymph and wet fly techniques. To the horror of dry-fly purists, Skues later wrote two books, &quot;Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream&quot;, and &quot;The Way of a Trout with a Fly&quot;, which greatly influenced the development of wet fly fishing. In northern England and Scotland, many anglers also favored wet-fly fishing, where the technique was more popular and widely practiced than in southern England. One of Scotland&#x27;s leading proponents of the wet fly in the early-to-mid 19th century was W.C. Stewart, who published &quot;The Practical Angler&quot; in 1857.
In the United States, attitudes toward methods of fly fishing were not nearly as rigidly defined, and both dry- and wet-fly fishing were soon adapted to the conditions of the country. Fly anglers there, are thought to be the first anglers to have used artificial lures for bass fishing. After pressing into service the fly patterns and tackle designed for trout and salmon to catch largemouth and smallmouth bass, they began to adapt these patterns into specific bass flies. Fly anglers seeking bass developed the spinner/fly lure and bass popper fly, which are still used today.

In the late 19th century, American anglers, such as Theodore Gordon, in the Catskill Mountains of New York began using fly tackle to fish the region&#x27;s brook trout-rich streams such as the Beaverkill and Willowemoc Creek. Many of these early American fly anglers also developed new fly patterns and wrote extensively about their sport, increasing the popularity of fly fishing in the region and in the United States as a whole. Albert Bigelow Paine, a New England author, wrote about fly fishing in &quot;The Tent Dwellers&quot;, a book about a three-week trip he and a friend took to central Nova Scotia in 1908.

Participation in fly fishing peaked in the early 1920s in the eastern states of Maine and Vermont and in the Midwest in the spring creeks of Wisconsin. Along with deep sea fishing, Ernest Hemingway did much to popularize fly fishing through his works of fiction, including The Sun Also Rises.

Big-game fishing started as a sport after the invention of the motorized boat. In 1898, Dr. Charles Frederick Holder, a marine biologist and early conservationist, pioneered this sport and went on to publish many articles and books on the subject noted for their combination of accurate scientific detail with exciting narratives.

One method of growing popularity is kayak fishing. Kayaks are stealthy and allow anglers to reach areas not fishable from land or by conventional boat. In addition, fishing from kayaks is regarded by some as an effort to level the playing field, to a degree, with their quarry and/or to challenge their angling abilities further by bringing an additional level of complexity to their sport.

== Sport fishing ==

Sport fishing or game fishing is recreational fishing activities that focus mainly on the physical exertion and thrilling experience during the process of subduing a hard-fighting fish, which provides the fisherman the excitement of a challenge (a good &quot;sport&quot; or &quot;game&quot;) and a satisfying sense of achievement after successfully catching the target. Sport fishing methods vary according to the area fished, the species targeted, the personal strategies of the angler, and the resources available. It ranges from the aristocratic art of fly fishing elaborated in Great Britain to the high-tech methods used to chase large bluewater fish. Sport fishing is usually done with hook, line, rod and reel rather than with nets, traps or other mass-fishing device (e.g., electrofishing), although fishing aids such as hand net, attractor light and fishfinder might be used. Non-angling techniques such as bowfishing and spearfishing are also considered sport fishing.

Among the most common saltwater game fish are predatory fishes such as wahoo, mahi-mahi, tuna, salmon, billfish (marlin, sailfish and swordfish), shark, grouper and mackerel, which can be pursued offshore on a boat, kayak or even from a surfboard, or casting from the shoreline into the surf zone (surf fishing). When fishing from a sea-going boat, groundbait known as &quot;chum&quot; is commonly used to attract fish.

In North America, popular freshwater fish include trout, bass, pike, catfish, walleye and muskellunge. The smallest fish are called panfish, because they can fit whole in a normal cooking pan, examples being perch and sunfish (Centrarchidae).

In the past, sport fishers, even if they did not eat their catch, almost always killed the fish and bring them to shore to be weighed or for preservation as trophies. In order to protect recreational fisheries, sport fishermen now often catch and release, and sometimes tag and release, which involves fitting the fish with identity tags, recording vital statistics, and sending a record to a government agency.

==Fishing techniques==
Recreational fishing techniques include hand gathering, bowfishing, spearfishing, netting, angling, and trapping.

Most recreational fishers use a fishing rod with a fishing line and a hook at the end of the line. The rod may be equipped with a reel so the line can be reeled in, and some form of bait or a lure attached to the hook. Fly fishing is a special form of rod fishing in which the reel is attached to the back end of the rod, and heavy line is cast with a complex, repetitive whipping motion to deliver the ultra light artificial fly to its target. Another less common technique is bowfishing using a bow or a crossbow. The &quot;arrow&quot; is a modified bolt with barbs at the tip, connected to a fishing line so the fish can be retrieved. Some crossbows are fitted with a reel.

The effective use of fishing techniques often depends on knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including migration, foraging, and habitat. Although there is certainly an element of &quot;luck&quot; to fishing, a recent science-based synthesis article reveals that fish capture is a complex function of three interdependent key processes: an individual fish&#x27;s internal state, its encounter with the gear, and the characteristics of the encountered gear (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12219/full).

==Fishing tackle==

Fishing tackle is the equipment used by fishers. Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle. Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, arrows, spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders and tackle boxes.

Tackle that is attached to the end of a fishing line is called terminal tackle. This includes hooks, sinkers, floats, leaders, swivels, split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures. The line, hook, bait and other fishing tackle arranged together form a fishing rig.

Fishing tackle can be contrasted with fishing techniques. Fishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the ways the tackle is used when fishing.

==Rules and regulations==

Recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit the way in which fish may be caught. The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) makes and oversees a set of voluntary guidelines. Typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth. Enforceable regulations are put in place by governments to ensure sustainable practice amongst anglers. For example, in the Republic of Ireland, the Central Fisheries Board oversees the implementation of all angling regulations, which include controls on angling lures, baits and number of hooks permissible, as well as licensing requirements and other conservation-based restrictions. Regulations notwithstanding, voluntary catch and release fishing as a means of protecting and sustaining game species has become an increasingly common practice among conservation-minded recreational anglers. Policy makers have largely ignored the recreational fishing sector but there is now a framework for better engagement to ensure that recreational fisheries receive the same attention as commercial fisheries.

In many places they have their rules in an &quot;anglers&#x27; handbook&quot;. Each year the handbook is updated and new rules such as catch and release, areas to fish and limits on fish can be found.

In the United States, recreational fishing poses the greatest risk of death from lightning of any activity, accounting for 10 percent of all lightning deaths between 2006 and 2019.

The Constitutional Court of Colombia considers sport fishing as unconstitutional.

==Fish logs==
Some recreational anglers keep a log of the fish they catch, and submit trophy-sized fish to independent record keeping bodies. In the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Specimen Fish Committee verifies and publicizes the capture of trophy fish caught with rod and line by anglers in Ireland, both in freshwater and at sea. The committee also ratifies Irish record rod caught fish. It uses a set of &#x27;fair play&#x27; regulations to ensure fish are caught in accordance with accepted angling norms.

==Competitions==

Recreational fishing competitions (tournaments) are a recent innovation in which fishermen compete for prizes based on the total weight of a given species of fish caught within a predetermined time. This sport evolved from local fishing contests into large competitive circuits, especially in North America. Competitors are most often professional fishermen who are supported by commercial endorsements. Other competitions are based purely on length with mandatory catch and release. Either longest fish or total length is documented with a camera and a mandatory sticker or unique item, a practice used since it is hard to weigh a living fish accurately in a boat.

Sport fishing competitions involve individuals if the fishing occurs from land, and usually teams if conducted from boats, as well as specified times and areas for catching fish. A score is awarded for each fish caught. The points awarded depend on the fish&#x27;s weight and species. Occasionally a score is divided by the strength of the fishing line used, yielding more points to those who use thinner, weaker line. In tag and release competitions, a flat score is awarded per fish species caught, divided by the line strength. Usually sport fishing competitions award a prize to the boat or team with the most points earned.

In Australia, a self-administered standard for the environmental assessment of tournament fishing has been proposed as an alternative and possible pathway to the ISO 14001 international standard. The standard assesses environmental, social, economic, and public risk factors. Tournament organizers may apply for voluntary certification. In some US states, fishery agencies and competition organizers create their own codes of practice.

==Industry==
The recreational fishing industry consists of enterprises such as the manufacture and retailing of fishing tackle, the design and building of recreational fishing boats, and the provision of fishing boats for charter and guided fishing trips.

&quot;Pay to fish&quot; enterprises provide anglers with controlled access to stocked lakes, ponds, or canals. These provide fishing opportunities outside of the permitted seasons and quotas applied to public waters. In the United Kingdom, commercial fisheries of this sort charge access fees. In North America, establishments usually charge for the fish caught, by length or by weight, rather than for access to the site although some establishments charge both types of fees.

Recreational fishing is a multibillion-dollar industry. In the United States in 2014, about 11 million recreational saltwater fishers generated $58 billion in sales impacts. By contrast, commercial fishing generated $141 billion in sales impacts.

==Biological invasions==
Several species, such as &quot;Cichla kelberi&quot;, &quot;C. piquiti&quot;, rainbow trout, Wels catfish, and many species in the family Centrarchidae have been introduced in natural or artificial environmental to the sport fishing. Some of these species have caused several impacts in aquatic biota.

<text>Uncontrolled Substance is the debut studio album by American rapper and Wu-Tang Clan member Inspectah Deck. The album was released on October 5, 1999, under Loud Records. Originally slated for release in 1995, the record was indefinitely postponed after a flood destroyed over 100 beats in RZA&#x27;s basement, including his original productions for the album. Eventually released four years later, &quot;Uncontrolled Substance&quot; received mostly positive reviews, and is Inspectah Deck&#x27;s most critically acclaimed and most commercially successful album to date. The album features Wu-Tang Clan members U-God and Masta Killa, and appearances from lesser-known affiliates Street Life, Killa Sin, and La the Darkman. A music video was made for the songs &quot;Word on the Street&quot; directed by Gregory Dark &amp; &quot;Show &#x27;N&#x27; Prove&quot; directed by Joseph Kahn. The album&#x27;s liner notes state that it is dedicated to Inspectah Deck&#x27;s late father, Frank Hunter.

== Commercial performance ==
The album reached the positions no. 19 and no. 3 on the Billboard 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, respectively. According to Inspectah Deck himself, the album managed to reach gold-level sales.

<text>The Citroën Dyane is an economy family car produced by the French automaker Citroën from 1967 to 1983. The Dyane&#x27;s design remained almost completely based on the Citroën 2CV and its underpinnings, but at the same time received almost all-new body panels, distinguished by more straight, angular overall features. The rear introduced a prominent large hatchback, while the modernized front wings now integrated the headlights.

A panel van version named the Acadiane was also derived from the Dyane. Nearly 1.45 million Dyanes and some 250,000 Acadianes were made, for a total of ~1.7 million units. Although the Dyane was a complete reskin of the 2CV, and body panels are not interchangeable, the 2CV remained on sale as a cheaper, entry-level model, and when the Dyane was retired after more than fifteen years, its predecessor, the 2CV, kept soldiering on, outliving its intended successor.

==Market context==
The Dyane was a development of the Citroën 2CV, and was intended as an answer to the increasingly popular Renault 4, which after its introduction in 1961 had affected 2CV sales. Like the Renault 4, the Dyane was designed from the outset as a hatchback with some other styling differences, such as conventional round headlamps set into the front fender with a squared stainless steel trim ring – as opposed to the old-fashioned separate units found on the 2CV – and stainless steel wheel embellishments as standard. It was and is often asserted that the Dyane was intended to replace the 2CV, but it was nevertheless aimed slightly higher in the Citroën range – between the 2CV and the Ami – and attracted a different clientele seeking the versatility offered by the Dyane&#x27;s hatchback.

==Panhard connections==
At the time of the Dyane&#x27;s development, the Citroën design department was busy on updates of the key DS and Ami models: design of the Dyane was therefore initially subcontracted to the Panhard design department, Panhard&#x27;s non-military business having in 1965 been absorbed into Citroën&#x27;s car business. The Panhard team under Louis Bionier (who had designed every Panhard model introduced between the late 1920s and the mid 1960s) produced a proposal that at a detailed level proved controversial with Citroën&#x27;s design chief, Robert Opron: the car was significantly reworked ahead of launch. The Dyane&#x27;s Panhard associations are also reflected in its name, Panhard having registered a copyright on the name Dyane along with Dyna, Dynavia and Dynamic.

==Description==
===Equipment levels===
At launch the car was offered with two levels of equipment and trim: The Basic &quot;Luxe&quot; and the slightly better equipped &quot;Confort&quot;. The &quot;Confort&quot; version was differentiated from the outside through the inclusion of hub-caps on the wheels. The spare wheel and jack were mounted in a special cradle under the bonnet/hood (rather than both simply being placed loose on the floor of the luggage area at the back). The interior of the &quot;Confort&quot; was slightly less basic, with plastic moulded door panels rather than flat, vinyl covered hardboard. The steering wheel was less &quot;rustic&quot; than that which the less expensive &quot;Luxe&quot; version of the Dyane shared with the Citroën 2CV. The extra 615 francs in the 1967 domestic market listed price for the Dyane &quot;Confort&quot; represented a supplement of just over 10% when compared to the list price for the more basic &quot;Luxe&quot;.

===Engine and running gear===
As with the 2CV, the engine was air-cooled, with a hemispherical combustion chamber and flat-topped pistons. The Dyane was launched on its home market in August 1967, and for the first five months only the 2CV&#x27;s 425 cc engine was fitted.

====More power====
The &quot;Dyane 6&quot; was announced at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1968, fitted with the Ami&#x27;s 602cc M4 engine. This came with an advertised maximum output of (SAE), supporting a claimed top speed of 115 km/h (71 mph), which was a useful improvement over the (SAE) of power and the claimed top speed of 100 km/h (63 mph) with which the Dyane had been launched.

The 602 cc engined Dyane did not replace the original 425 cc engined car. However, two months later, in March 1968, the 425cc unit &quot;was&quot; replaced, in a car now described as the &quot;Dyane 4&quot;, by an improved 435 cc engine providing (SAE). The extra power came from changes including not only the slight increase in cylinder dimensions, but also an extra 2 mm of carburetor diameter and a raised compression ratio. Although there was a price to be paid in terms of higher fuel consumption, the listed top speed went up to 105 km/h (66 mph) and acceleration was measurably less anæmic.

In September 1968 the M4 was replaced by an improved 602 cc engine featuring higher compression pistons and forced induction from the engine fan giving slightly more power. As with the 2CV and Ami, cooling air was ducted straight to the heater, giving excellent demisting and heating. Mechanical contact-breakers were mounted at the front of the camshaft and located behind the cooling fan. The fan was mounted on a tapered shaft and secured with a bolt at the bottom of a deep tube (the top of which engaged the starter handle). As the mounting location of the points was not obvious to the uninformed, they were often neglected. The ignition coil fired both cylinders simultaneously (wasting one spark) and the spark plug wear was significantly greater than it should have been; 6000 miles was not uncommon for a spark plug.

Cylinder heads were held on with three studs and barrels slipped over the pistons. No Cylinder-head gasket was used, and since the wings unbolted in a few minutes, it was possible to remove the cylinder heads and barrels, change the pistons or piston-rings and reassemble the top end very quickly, using only a few tools.

It was based on the same platform chassis as the Citroën 2CV, sharing its advanced independent front to rear interconnected suspension. This comprised a central springing unit, running fore-and-aft in a tube on each side; each suspension arm on that side was linked to the spring, by a tie-rod and a &#x27;knife-edge&#x27; pivot-pin. Early cars did not have conventional shock absorbers. See Citroën 2CV for detailed information. The squeak heard from most 2CVs and Dyanes as they go over bumps is due to lack of lubrication either inside the spring tubes or to the &#x27;knife-edges&#x27;. The front hubs kingpins need to be greased every 600 miles. Since this is often overlooked, the king-pins can be prone to wear, although some movement is acceptable.

The Dyane was also available with the &quot;trafficlutch&quot; - a centrifugal clutch which helped avoid stalling whilst in slow moving urban traffic.

==Specifications==
==Market reaction==
The Dyane was conceived to fill a small niche between the manufacturer&#x27;s 2CV and Ami models, and in due course to replace the former. The 2CV had been developed and, in 1948, launched at a time of austerity and low wages. More than twenty years later, with the much more modern Renault 4 selling strongly against the Citroën offerings, it was thought that buyers must be ready for a less aggressively basic approach. During the years since 1948 production technology had become more streamlined, as auto-industry wages grew ahead of the overall growth in the French economy, and production of the 2CV was, by the standard of more recent models, a very labour-intensive process.

During the Dyane&#x27;s first full year of production, supported by the interest and marketing activity generated by new-car launch, 98,769 Dyanes were produced which meant that it was indeed produced, even at this stage, in greater volumes than the 2CV with just 57,473 cars produced. In 1969 the Dyane was again produced at a higher rate, this time with 95,434 units as against 72,044 for the older car. However, the 2CV refused to die, and with 121,096 2CVs produced in 1970, the older car was back in front. The Dyane soldiered on, with French production rates remaining more than respectable, for more than another decade. However, the Dyane&#x27;s annual volumes would never again beat those of the 2CV.

===Production figures===
These figures indicate that any plans for the Dyane to take over from the 2CV were short-lived. These numbers exclude Yugoslavia and Iran production. 
==Yugoslavian manufacture==
Tomos began assembling Citroën automobiles from kits at the Koper plant in 1959, and selling them in the Yugoslavian market. The Yugoslavian automobile market was closed, so this joint venture with a local firm allowed Citroën to access the market.

Locally assembled vehicles (from CKD kits) by Tomos included the Ami 8, 2CV6, GS, and Dyane (called the Diana). In 1972, Tomos, Iskra, and Citroën formed a new joint venture: Cimos. All cars assembled in Koper after 1972 are from CKD kits and still branded Citroën with the Citroën logo. Cimos also sold imported Citroën vehicles, the CX and Mehari. The Cimos GS can be distinguished by round headlights. Cimos also made Dak and Geri, Dyane-based utility vehicles from CKD kits.

== Iranian manufacture ==

The Dyane was also built in Iran by SAIPA from 1968 to 1980, where it was called the Jian or Jyane - a Persian word meaning &quot;fierce&quot; or &quot;ferocious&quot;. Unique van and pick-up versions were also manufactured there. SAIPA built 120,000 Jyane models.

==UK press reaction==
In the UK, a Citroën Dyane 6 tested by the British &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in July 1969 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 30.8 seconds. An overall fuel consumption of was recorded, although when driven gently the Dyane managed a class leading . The test car was priced by Citroën in the UK at £648 including taxes, the same price that BMC were sticking on their Mini 1000 Super. The car was commended for its versatility, spaciousness and comfort as well as for unexpectedly good road holding and fuel economy &quot;when not driven hard&quot;. Acceleration and top speed fell short of the class average, however. Apart from the Mini, UK market competitors identified by the journal included the Hillman Imp and the Reliant Rebel as well as the (at the time very popular ) Renault 4.

== Competitions ==
A Dyane driven by Michel Peyret and Jean-Jacques Cornelli participated in the 44th Monte Carlo Rally in 1976. Entered with number 102, it finished 80th out of 84 classified competitors and 148 starters.

<text>Bagh-e-Jinnah (), formerly known as Lawrence Gardens, is a historical park in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. The large green space contains a botanical garden, Masjid Dar-ul-Islam, and Quaid-e-Azam Library.
There are also entertainment and sports facilities within the park: an open-air theater, a restaurant, tennis courts and the Gymkhana Cricket Ground. It is located on Lawrence Road next to Lahore Zoo, directly across from the Governor&#x27;s House on The Mall.

==History==

The site was originally occupied by the Agri-Horticultural Society of the Punjab and had been planned as a botanical garden modelled on Kew Gardens in London. The garden was named after John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, who served as the first Chief Commissioner and then Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, and who later became Viceroy of India from 1864 to 1869.

By 1860, when the first part of Lawrence Gardens had been laid out, the site had become a wilderness, partly used as a menagerie and the rest as a pleasure ground for badminton, archery and cricket. The first tree planted in the garden was in January 1862 and that same year Lawrence Hall was constructed for holding public meetings and theatrical entertainment. In 1866 Montgomery Hall was also completed and in 1868 the site enlarged through the purchase of land to the south of the gardens. By 1876 the garden contained 80,000 trees and shrubs of 600 different species including trees from the plains of India, Austria, Syria, and southern Europe.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Lawrence Garden began selling plants it had grown to the general public. Fruit trees were imported from across the British Empire, including grapes and mulberries from Kabul, peaches from Agra, and plantain from Calcutta. In 1904 the Department of Agriculture became responsible for maintenance of the garden and since 1912 approximately seven acres have been managed by Government College University, Lahore.

Following Partition and the creation of Pakistan, Lawrence Gardens was renamed Bagh-e-Jinnah in honour of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. A statue of Lawrence, standing outside the nearby Lahore High Court, was removed in August 1951 and later moved to Foyle and Londonderry College in Northern Ireland. Lawrence and Montgomery Halls were repurposed for the Quaid-e-Azam Library in 1984.

==Geography==
The gardens are currently situated within . The site was originally larger, consisting of , however part of the land was given to Lahore Zoo, and for local development.

==Botany==

It has almost 150 varieties of trees, 140 types of shrubs, 50 types of creepers, 30 palms, almost 100 succulent and about same indoor along with almost all varieties of annual flowers. The garden has a good name in Chrysanthemum shows, it was the first institute that started growing chrysanthemum and maximum no of varieties for it. It has 3 nurseries, 4 hilloaks in it.

==Information and services==
*Bagh-e-Jinnah has two libraries, Quaid-e-Azam library and Darussalam in it.
*Regarding collection of trees, shrubs and climbers a book has been published by Ch. Muhammad Tariq (DDA Jinnah Garden, Muhammad Ramzan Rafique (Agricultural Officer) and Dr. Muhammad Afzal (Instructor). (Flora of Jinnah Garden) This book contains common name, botanical name, flower time, type of plant (deciduous or evergreen), flowering colour of each plant along with its picture. Furthermore, this book contains selective pictures from the palm garden, annual flowers in this garden. This book can be obtained from the office of Jinnah Garden.
* The park receives a nostalgic mention of the 1970s and 1980s life in Bano Qudsia&#x27;s Urdu novel &quot;Raja Gidh&quot;.
* The Park has a Tomb of a saint named Peer Sakhi Abul Faizul Hassan commonly known as Baba Turat Muraad Shah, with a heavy number of visitors.
* The park has a track of 2.65 kilometers.

== Cricket ground ==

Bagh-e-Jinnah park is a famous cricket ground since 1885, built for the entertainment of government officers and civil servants. Lahore Gymkhana Club had regular fixtures here. The ground played host to friendly matches, competitive fixtures and host to Pakistan&#x27;s first unofficial Test against the West Indies in 1948. A few more unofficial Tests later, Bagh-e-Jinnah became a Test venue when Pakistan took on India in 1954–55. New Zealand and West Indies also played a Test here before Bagh-e-Jinnah lost its Test status as it played second fiddle to Gaddafi Stadium but still hosts tour matches involving visiting nations, especially England.

<text>North Twin (Peak) is one of the two main peaks that comprise The Twins massif located at the northeast corner of the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada. The other lower peak is named South Twin (3,566 m). North Twin is the third-highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, after Mount Robson and Mount Columbia.

The massif was named &quot;The Twins&quot; in 1898 by J. Norman Collie and Hugh M. Stutfield. The decision to name the peaks separately was approved February 28, 1980.

In addition to North Twin and , the massif contains a northern subpeak of North Twin known as Twins Tower, (see lower photo). This sits atop the famed north face of the massif (see below), and was named in 1984. Further, another subpeak in the massif is known as West Twin , a picture of which can be found in the South Twin Gallery - access to this peak is from the north–south col.

==Routes==
The first ascent of North Twin was recorded on 10 July 1923 by W.S. Ladd, J.M. Thorington, and Conrad Kain, via the East Face.

The normal route is a ski mountaineering climb on the eastern slopes, and it is possible to ski all the way to the summit. A traverse can be made to the South Twin, although an ice axe is recommended for the narrow connecting ridge.

==Notable ascents==
The nearly vertical north face drops over from Twins Tower to the Athabasca River - the true summit of North Twin is somewhat removed from the top of the north face. The north face is renowned in climbing circles and has been climbed by only four parties:

* 1974 &quot;Lowe-Jones&quot; (VI 5.10 A3, 1500m), George Lowe and Chris Jones from 6 August to 12 August 1974.
* 1985 &quot;North Pillar&quot; or &quot;Blanchard/Cheesemond&quot; by Barry Blanchard and Dave Cheesmond.
* 2004 &quot;House/Prezelj&quot; by Steve House and Marko Prezelj.
* 2013 North Pillar (2nd Ascent) by Josh Wharton and Jon Walsh.

<doc id="705248" wikidata="Q720228" url="?curid=705248" title="Segundo Ruiz Belvis">
<text>Segundo Ruiz Belvis (13 May 1829 – 3 November 1867) was a Puerto Rican abolitionist who also fought for Puerto Rico&#x27;s right to independence.

==Early years==
Ruiz Belvis was born in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico (then a barrio of the municipality of Mayagüez) to José Antonio Ruiz and Manuela Belvis. He received his primary education in Aguadilla. Ruiz Belvis went to Venezuela and graduated with a degree in philosophy from the University of Caracas. He later earned a law degree from the Central University of Madrid in Spain. During his stay in Spain, he befriended people with both liberal and reformist ideals who proposed the abolition of slavery.

==Abolitionist==
In 1859, Ruiz Belvis returned to Puerto Rico and befriended Ramón Emeterio Betances, joining &quot;The Secret Abolitionist Society&quot; founded by Betances. The society baptized and emancipated thousands of enslaved African children. The event, which was known as &quot;aguas de libertad&quot; (waters of liberty), was carried out at the Cathedral of Mayagüez. Later, he moved to the city of Mayagüez where he established his law practice. Ruiz Belvis was named Justice of the Peace by the city&#x27;s citizens. He was later appointed to the Mayagüez city council as a representative. His responsibilities included watching over the well being of the slaves in his district and the management of public funds. Ruiz Belvis became involved in politics and took up the cause of abolitionism in the island.

When Ruiz Belvis returned to Madrid in 1865, he represented the abolitionist cause to the Cortes Generales. Although his ideas were considered dangerous by the Spanish rulers for their threat to the existing order, he helped begin the movement that would eventually lead to the liberation of the slaves in the remaining Spanish Colonies in Latin America. In 1866 after his father&#x27;s death, Ruiz Belvis inherited his family&#x27;s hacienda &quot;Josefa&quot;; the first thing he did was free the slaves.

==Puerto Rican independence advocate==

Upon returning to Puerto Rico, Ruiz Belvis found out that the Spanish-appointed governor, José María Marchesi Oleaga, did not like the liberal ideas that Ruiz Belvis and his friends had; they were all banished to exile.

Ruiz Belvis eventually ended up in New York in 1866, where together with Betances and other patriots, he formed the &quot;Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico&quot; (Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico) for the independence of the island. They developed a plan to send an armed expedition to Puerto Rico, in what was to become known as the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot;. During this time, Ruiz Belvis became ill. He still traveled to Valparaíso, Chile, to raise funds for the planned revolution.

Ruiz Belvis died in Valparaiso of Fournier&#x27;s gangrene on 3 November 1867. He died before the uprising the next year—&quot;Grito de Lares&quot;—which failed. Slavery was finally abolished in Puerto Rico on 22 March 1873. He is buried in the chapel of the Cemetery of Hormigueros.

==Legacy==
To honor the memory of Segundo Ruiz Belvis, Puerto Rico has named many streets after him. A school has been named for him in each of the following places: his birth town of Hormigueros, Ponce, and Santurce. In the United States, &quot;Segundo Ruiz Belvis Cultural Center&quot; was named for him in Chicago, Illinois, and &quot;Segundo Ruiz Belvis Diagnostic and Treatment Center&quot; in the Bronx, New York.

<doc id="705256" wikidata="Q176968" url="?curid=705256" title="Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan">
<text>The foreign employees in Meiji Japan, known in Japanese as O-yatoi Gaikokujin (Kyūjitai: , Shinjitai: , &#x27;hired foreigners&#x27;), were hired by the Japanese government and municipalities for their specialized knowledge and skill to assist in the modernization of the Meiji period. The term came from &quot;Yatoi&quot; (a person hired temporarily, a day laborer), was politely applied for hired foreigner as &quot;O-yatoi gaikokujin&quot;.

The total number is over 2,000, probably reaches 3,000 (with thousands more in the private sector). Until 1899, more than 800 hired foreign experts continued to be employed by the government, and many others were employed privately. Their occupation varied, ranging from high salaried government advisors, college professors and instructor, to ordinary salaried technicians.

Along the process of the opening of the country, the Tokugawa Shogunate government first hired German diplomat Philipp Franz von Siebold as diplomatic advisor, Dutch naval engineer Hendrik Hardes for Nagasaki Arsenal and Willem Johan Cornelis, Ridder Huijssen van Kattendijke for Nagasaki Naval Training Center, French naval engineer François Léonce Verny for Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, and British civil engineer Richard Henry Brunton. Most of the O-yatoi were appointed through government approval with two or three years contract, and took their responsibility properly in Japan, except in some cases.

As the Public Works hired almost 40% of the total number of the O-yatois, the main goal in hiring the O-yatois was to obtain transfers of technology and advice on systems and cultural ways. Therefore, young Japanese officers gradually took over the post of the O-yatoi after they completed training and education at the Imperial College, Tokyo, the Imperial College of Engineering or studying abroad.

The O-yatois were highly paid; in 1874, they numbered 520 men, at which time their salaries came to ¥2.272 million, or 33.7 percent of the national annual budget.

Despite the value they provided in the modernization of Japan, the Japanese government did not consider it prudent for them to settle in Japan permanently. After the contract terminated, most of them returned to their country except some, like Josiah Conder and William Kinninmond Burton.

The system was officially terminated in 1899 when extraterritoriality came to an end in Japan. Nevertheless, similar employment of foreigners persists in Japan, particularly within the national education system and professional sports.

<text>In the Cut is a 2003 psychological thriller film written and directed by Jane Campion and starring Meg Ryan, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kevin Bacon. Campion&#x27;s screenplay is an adaptation of the 1995 novel of the same name by Susanna Moore. The film focuses on an English teacher who becomes personally entangled with a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders in her Manhattan neighborhood.

The film received a limited release on October 22, 2003, in the United States, and was subsequently given a wide release on Halloween that year in the United States and United Kingdom. The film received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Negative reviews were critical of the story and narrative structure, while positive reviews praised the acting and Campion&#x27;s visuals.

In recent years, the film has undergone a reappraisal for its subversion of the male gaze and other common movie tropes.

==Plot==
Frannie Avery, an introverted writer and English teacher in New York City, meets one of her students, Cornelius, at a local pub to talk about coursework. Cornelius proposes a theory that John Wayne Gacy may not have been guilty of his crimes, later suggesting that &#x27;desire&#x27; was responsible. On her way to the basement bathroom, she witnesses a woman performing oral sex on a man. Though it&#x27;s dark, she can see a 3 of spades tattoo on the man&#x27;s wrist and the woman&#x27;s blue fingernails.

Periodically, Frannie reads poems on subway posters that seem to have bearing on her own life.

Several days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions Frannie as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman whose severed limb was found in Frannie&#x27;s garden. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective&#x27;s sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows disillusioned with the sexist attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective&#x27;s partner, Richard Rodriguez, who can no longer carry a gun because he tried to kill his wife. Frannie questions Malloy about his 3 of spades tattoo, which he says identifies him as a member of a secret club. While walking home from a bar, she is assaulted by a masked stranger. She phones Malloy, and the two have passionate sex. She realizes a charm is missing from her bracelet.

The next day, Frannie describes the sexual encounter to her free-spirited half-sister, Pauline, who lives above a strip club. After Malloy tells Frannie that she and the murder victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, she begins to suspect that Malloy may be the killer. A second victim is found dismembered in a washing machine at a school laundry. Frannie accompanies Malloy to a secluded spot along a river, where he teaches her to use a gun. Meanwhile, Cornelius has been taken in for police questioning on suspicion of the murders because his term paper on John Wayne Gacy is illustrated with blood.

Frannie is confronted by her former boyfriend, John Graham, who has been stalking her. He tells her he has been having panic attacks and that he wishes to ask Pauline out on a date. She goes to Pauline&#x27;s apartment, which she finds unlocked and in disarray. In the bathroom, she finds Pauline&#x27;s severed head in a plastic bag. After being questioned by Malloy, Frannie gets drunk in her apartment. Cornelius arrives and attempts to rape her, but is interrupted by Detective Rodriguez. Later, Malloy reveals that the killer&#x27;s &#x27;signature&#x27; is leaving a ring on the finger of his victims. Frannie handcuffs him to a pipe, and they have sex. After discovering that Malloy has her missing charm and a key to Pauline&#x27;s apartment, she confronts him about his tattoo and suggests that he is the serial killer. She takes Malloy&#x27;s jacket and gun, leaving him handcuffed, and is met by Rodriguez outside. He persuades her to get into his unmarked police car.

Rodriguez drives Frannie to the Little Red Lighthouse below the George Washington Bridge. She tells him that it reminds her of a book she teaches, &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. Frannie notices Rodriguez has the same tattoo as Malloy. Rodriguez presents a ring on the end of a knife and asks Frannie to marry him. Realizing that Rodriguez is the killer, Frannie shoots him with Malloy&#x27;s gun. He attempts to strangle her, but she fires the gun again, killing him. Bloodied, she walks back to her apartment and lies down with Malloy, who is still cuffed to the pipe where she left him.

==Cast==
==Production==
Laurie Parker and Jane Campion spent five years developing the film. Nicole Kidman got a producer credit because she was originally cast as Frannie, but dropped out because she was getting a divorce and needed more time with her children. This film was executive produced by Effie T. Brown, in association with Sony Screen Gems and Pathé International.

==Box office==
&quot;In the Cut&quot; grossed $1,666,830 at the box office in Australia.

The total worldwide gross of &quot;In the Cut&quot; was $23,726,793.

==Reception==
Contemporary

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 33% based on reviews from 174 critics and an average rating of 4.86/10; the consensus reads: &quot;Jane Campion takes a stab at subverting the psycho-sexual thriller genre with &quot;In the Cut&quot;, but gets tangled in her own abstraction.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on reviews from 38 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. CinemaScore gave it a rating of &quot;F&quot; based on surveys from general audiences.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Beautifully crafted and highlighted by an arresting change-of-pace [performance] by Meg Ryan as an English teacher erotically awakened by a homicide detective. But the story&#x27;s unpalatable narrative holes and dramatic missteps will hold sway over the pic&#x27;s better qualities.&quot;
Noel Murray of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote: &quot;Though the oppressive artiness makes the early scenes fairly ridiculous, the director&#x27;s odd methods add rare tension to the climax, as it becomes evident that the finale won&#x27;t be so predictable in Campion&#x27;s hands.&quot;

In a positive review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Manohla Dargis wrote “the film is filled with surreal, hothouse flourishes that tell the story as vividly and often more eloquently than either the plot mechanics or dialogue”, adding that it “may be the most maddening and imperfect great movie of the year”. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said although &quot;In the Cut&quot; “falls short of the masterpiece Campion intended, it&#x27;s unquestionably the most ambitious and important film to come along in months”.

Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote although the film was flawed as a thriller, it&#x27;s not such a write-off as a psychosexual portrait of a certain kind of single Manhattan woman at the turn of the new century. With its restless, jittery camera, the movie captures the jangly paranoia of a city that is often equally tantalizing and threatening; Frannie responds in kind, with her own contradictory sexual persona, which at certain times is defiantly autonomous and at others almost timidly girlish. A &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; for the post-9/11 age (the remnants of that tragedy form one of the movie&#x27;s many visual leitmotifs), &quot;In the Cut&quot; focuses on the darker face of the classic New York romance. It&#x27;s a face that&#x27;s grimly credible, if seldom seen. Within an otherwise flawed, forgettable movie, Campion has managed to offer a vivid, if fleeting, glimpse of the wariness, self-deception and fear that shadow so many illicit thrills of sex in the city.Hornaday also singled out Ruffalo&#x27;s performance, writing the actor is “unsettlingly convincing as a man whose sexual magnetism lies not in leading-man good looks but in his ability to portray himself as both a protector and, if the situation warrants, a predator”.
&quot;In the Cut&quot; was among the films discussed favorably by Slavoj Žižek in &quot;The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Cinema&quot; (2006).

Retrospective

In the years since &quot;In the Cut&quot;&#x27;s original release, the film has been reexamined and praised as a feminist erotic thriller. Critics noted how Campion emphasizes female agency and pleasure, and subverts many tropes of the genre such as the femme fatale archetype and the male gaze. Writing for &quot;Thrillist&quot;, Jourdain Searles said the film isa story about women being hunted, from their vantage point for once. Shots depicting Frannie being watched mainly serve to highlight how women have to navigate the world under the gaze of men. Frannie is always looking over her shoulder, constantly assessing her surroundings. She knows she is being watched, yet continues to pursue pleasure on her own terms. In the end, once Frannie has faced her worst fears, &quot;In the Cut&quot; rewards that bravery.

&quot;In the Cut&quot; has also been interpreted as a deconstruction of fantasies of romance, particularly the idealization of marriage. Writing for &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Zach Vasquez said the film succeeds at both combining &quot;the lurid aesthetic of Bava/Argento with a modern examination of violent patriarchal power dynamics&quot;, citing Campion&#x27;s &quot;use of speed ramping, slow motion, lens flares, and more&quot;. Nick James placed &quot;In the Cut&quot; at No. 3 in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;&#x27;s list of twenty-first century noir films, writing &quot;it’s the way that Campion, in scene after scene, juxtaposes powerful female desire with vulnerability that makes &quot;In the Cut&quot; a unique noir&quot;. Film critic David Thomson has also called the film a masterpiece, and, in his book &quot;Moments That Made the Movies&quot;, hails it as &quot;one of the great films of the twenty-first century.&quot;

<text>Mount Woolley is a mountain in Alberta, Canada, located in the Sunwapta River Valley of Jasper National Park, 1½ km south of Diadem Peak and is part of Winston Churchill Range of the Canadian Rockies.

==History==
The mountain was named in 1898 by J. Norman Collie after Herman Woolley. Woolley, a former football player, climbed extensively with Collie during his 1898 and 1902 expeditions into the Canadian Rockies.

The first ascent was made in 1925 by a Japanese team consisting of S. Hashimoto, H. Hatano, T. Hayakawa, Y. Maki, Y. Mita and N. Okabe. They were guided by Hans Fuhrer, H. Kohler and J. Weber.

==Geology==
Mount Woolley is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Woolley is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C.

<doc id="705273" wikidata="Q280339" url="?curid=705273" title="Tropicana Las Vegas">
<text>The Tropicana Las Vegas was a casino hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It operated from 1957 to 2024. In its final years, the property included a casino and 1,467 rooms. The complex occupied at the southeast corner of the Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection.

The resort was conceived by Ben Jaffe, part owner of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach. The $15 million Tropicana opened on April 4, 1957, as the most expensive Las Vegas resort developed up to that point. The hotel originally opened with low-rise structures containing 300 rooms, and the property would later launch several expansions, including two hotel towers added in 1979 and 1986 respectively. The latter tower was accompanied by the introduction of an island theme for the property. The Tropicana was host to various live entertainment, including the topless showgirl revue known as &quot;Folies Bergere&quot;. It ended in 2009, after nearly 50 years, and remains the longest-running show in Las Vegas history.

The Tropicana underwent numerous ownership changes throughout its history. Mob connections were present at the time of its opening, and an FBI investigation in 1979 uncovered a skimming operation at the resort. It was sold that year to Ramada Inns, which later transferred ownership to its spin-off company, Aztar Corporation, in 1989. During the 2000s, Aztar considered demolishing the Tropicana for development of a new resort, although this did not come to fruition. Columbia Sussex bought the resort in 2007, but lost it to bankruptcy two years later, with Onex Corporation emerging as the new owner. Onex launched a $180 million renovation, the property&#x27;s first since 1986. The project was completed in 2011 and added a South Beach theme.

Penn National Gaming bought the Tropicana in 2015, then sold the property to its spin-off company, Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (GLPI), in 2020. Bally&#x27;s Corporation purchased the Tropicana two years later and leased the land from GLPI. In 2023, Bally&#x27;s and GLPI reached a redevelopment agreement with the Oakland Athletics, a Major League Baseball team. The Tropicana would be demolished to make way for two new projects: a baseball stadium (tentatively the New Las Vegas Stadium) on nine acres of the site, and a new Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas resort on the remaining land. The Tropicana closed on April 2, 2024, and demolition began within a month. The last remaining structures, the two hotel towers, were imploded on October 9, 2024.

==History==
===Development and opening===
The Tropicana was conceived by Ben Jaffe, part owner of the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach. In 1955, Jaffe came to Las Vegas and bought the vacant property that would become the site of the Tropicana. M. Tony Sherman of Miami was the architect and Taylor Construction Company was the general contractor. Jaffe intended the Tropicana to be the finest hotel in Las Vegas.

Construction ran over schedule and over budget, due in part to competition for labor with the under-construction Stardust, also on the Las Vegas Strip. Jaffe had to sell his interest in the Fontainebleau to complete the Tropicana. Originally proposed as a $4.5 million project, it ultimately cost $15 million, including $800,000 for decorating and tropical landscaping. It was the most expensive Las Vegas resort developed up to that point, beating the $8.5 million Riviera, which opened two years earlier. The Tropicana would be advertised as &quot;the Tiffany of the Strip&quot;, in reference to the high-end jeweler Tiffany &amp; Co.

The project had 30 investors, including singer Morton Downey, who owned a five-percent interest. Jaffe first leased the property to Phil Kastel, who supervised the project during construction. However, the Gaming Control Board raised suspicions over Kastel&#x27;s apparent links to organized crime, prompting him to sell his interest in the Tropicana in early 1957. This paved the way for the issuance of a gaming license. J. Kell Houssels, owner of the Las Vegas Club, was hired to operate the Tropicana casino.

The Tropicana hosted a preview opening for local residents on April 3, 1957, before debuting to the general public a day later. The resort&#x27;s involvement with organized crime was confirmed a month later, when a note bearing a Tropicana earnings figure was found in the possession of mobster Frank Costello, who was associated with Kastel. Costello had been shot in a failed assassination attempt, and police discovered the note while he was under hospital care.

The control board subsequently investigated to determine whether Kastel was still secretly involved with the Tropicana. Kastel had publicly invested more than $300,000 in the project during construction, and the Nevada Tax Commission eventually ordered the Tropicana to rid its ties with him as soon as possible by paying off the debt owed to him. The note was ultimately traced to Tropicana executive Louis Lederer and cashier Michael Tanico, both of whom would be removed from the property.

===Early ownership changes===
By 1959, Houssels bought out Jaffe&#x27;s interest, gaining a majority share in the Tropicana and becoming its new president. The Jaffe family, however, would retain ownership of the land for decades and continue leasing it. The Tropicana prospered throughout the next decade. Houssells sold out in 1968 to Trans-Texas Airways, for $8.7 million, but remained as manager for a few years.

In the early 1970s, the Tropicana fared poorly from competition with larger, newer hotels like Caesars Palace and the Las Vegas Hilton. During this time, the Tropicana hosted annual fiesta parties to increase gaming revenue, inviting celebrities and high rollers to attend. Deil Gustafson, a Minnesota financier, bought the resort in 1972. Sammy Davis Jr. also purchased an eight-percent interest, becoming the first black person to own a share in a Strip resort. Gustafson undertook an expansion plan, but encountered financing difficulties. In 1974, brothers Edward and Fred Doumani took over management on an emergency basis after investing $1 million into the property.

Mitzi Stauffer Briggs, heir to the Stauffer Chemical fortune, bought a majority interest in the Tropicana in 1975. Briggs said she knew &quot;absolutely nothing about gambling or casinos&quot;, but invested in the Tropicana at the suggestion of a friend. Many of its top executives were either fired or resigned in 1976, as Briggs sought to make the resort profitable once again. She invested more than $6 million in the property. Briggs initially received only a probationary one-year gaming license, due to several business failures in her past. She received a full license in July 1977, and began construction of the property&#x27;s first high-rise structure, the Tiffany Tower, which opened two years later. The casino floor was also renovated and expanded.

The Tropicana became the target of a mob skimming operation in 1978. Joe Agosto, then-owner of the casino&#x27;s &quot;Folies Bergere&quot; show, oversaw the siphoning of money from the cashier cage to the Kansas City crime family. The scheme was exposed in 1979 through &quot;Operation Strawman&quot;, an FBI investigation into hidden mob interests in Las Vegas casinos. Due to her inexperience, Briggs had relied on the advice of Agosto, whom she found to be charming. Because they had allowed Agosto to manage the casino without a gaming license, Briggs and Gustafson faced revocation of their own licenses. They had little choice but to sell the Tropicana. Hotel chain Ramada Inns purchased the business in December 1979, along with a 50% share of the property&#x27;s real estate that had been owned by the Doumanis. Briggs lost an estimated $44 million during her involvement with the Tropicana, and did not receive any of the profits from the Ramada purchase. The Doumani brothers and Gufstafson later accused Ramada of breaching its contract on the sale, winning a $34 million judgment in 1989.

Gustafson was convicted in 1983 over a check kiting scheme involving the Tropicana, and served 40 months in prison. In 1995, he was also charged with bankruptcy fraud relating to the Tropicana&#x27;s 1979 sale. He, in turn, named the Doumani brothers and two others involved in a scheme with him to divert money from the 1989 judgment; these four individuals were charged as well. Federal officials alleged that the diverted money had wound up in the possession of mobsters. Gustafson pled guilty and agreed to testify against the others. One defendant was dismissed because of lack of evidence, and the others were found not guilty in a 1998 trial.

===Later years===

Amid the early 1980s recession, Ramada began targeting a middle-class clientele for the Tropicana, which had lost the luxury prominence it once had. In 1986, the resort completed a $70 million expansion which included a second high-rise, the Island Tower. The project also introduced a five-acre pool area of man-made lagoons, waterfalls and islands, accompanied by floating blackjack tables. The property began marketing itself as the &quot;Island of Las Vegas&quot;.
Ramada spun off its gaming properties, including the Tropicana, in 1989 as Aztar Corporation. By the late 1990s, the Tropicana was largely seen as an aging, under-performing property in contrast to newer resorts on the Strip.

In 1998, Aztar bought an option to acquire the 50% interest held by the Jaffe family, which would make future renovations easier to implement. Aztar, however, held off its buyout for several years to assess whether Las Vegas had been overbuilt with new hotels. The company eventually consolidated ownership of the Tropicana in 2002, buying the half interest in the land and buildings from the Jaffe family for $117.5 million. The sale opened up the possibility of redeveloping the Tropicana site.

In 2003, Aztar unveiled potential plans for a $500 million expansion. The project would replace the northern half of the existing Tropicana facilities, adding additional rooms and timeshares. A decision about whether to proceed with these plans was expected in early 2004, but was pushed back by Aztar to focus on an expansion at its other Tropicana resort, located in Atlantic City. Following the latter&#x27;s completion, Aztar would continue to put off its Las Vegas redevelopment plans to further evaluate the best use of the land.

In 2006, Aztar unveiled new plans to demolish the Tropicana and build a $1.2 billion casino resort. Gaming analysts viewed the redevelopment plans as a certainty; Aztar had already hired Marnell Corrao Associates to manage construction, and sought bank financing to fund the project. However, a bidding war soon began for Aztar, with Ameristar Casinos, Columbia Sussex, and Pinnacle Entertainment competing to buy the company. Aztar was desired for its ownership of the Tropicana, which presented ample redevelopment opportunities. Columbia Sussex ultimately prevailed, finalizing its purchase in January 2007.

Columbia Sussex planned to renovate the Tropicana as part of a $2 billion expansion project, adding five new towers for more than 8,000 rooms. However, this project was put on hold because of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, and it later became moot when Columbia Sussex&#x27;s gaming arm filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The Tropicana, which had a $440 million secured loan against it, was bought from the bankrupt company in July 2009 by its creditors, led by Canadian private equity firm Onex Corporation and former MGM Mirage CEO Alex Yemenidjian, who took over as the Tropicana&#x27;s CEO.

The remainder of Columbia Sussex&#x27;s gaming business, reorganized under new ownership as Tropicana Entertainment Inc., promptly sued the Las Vegas property, demanding royalties for use of the Tropicana name. The case was eventually settled, with the Tropicana Las Vegas receiving exclusive rights to use the name in the Las Vegas region, royalty-free.
Amid the Great Recession, the Tropicana emphasized its cheap amenities to attract a value-conscious demographic. After taking over the Tropicana, Yemenidjian sought to update the property and transform it into a middle-class resort: &quot;We&#x27;re not interested in the very low end because there&#x27;s no margin in that business. And we&#x27;re not interested in the very high end because those customers have different expectations. The most successful properties in Las Vegas are both aspirational and accessible as opposed to those targeting a narrow market.&quot;

Renovations began in August 2009, and cost $180 million. It marked the Tropicana&#x27;s first major remodel in nearly 25 years, and added a South Beach theme to the property. Room renovations were completed in 2010, and work on the casino floor was expected to conclude by the end of the year.

In August 2015, Penn National Gaming purchased the Tropicana for $360 million, marking its first resort on the Strip. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Penn faced the prospect of financial issues brought on by resort closures. As a result, Penn sold the land occupied by the Tropicana to its spin-off company, Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (GLPI). The land sold for $337.5 million in rent credits, and the sale was finalized in April 2020. Penn would continue to operate the Tropicana for another two years, or until the resort was sold.

In April 2021, Bally&#x27;s Corporation agreed to purchase the Tropicana, a deal that was finalized in September 2022. Bally&#x27;s bought the non-land assets of the resort from GLPI and Penn for $148 million, and leased the land from GLPI for annual rent of $10.5 million. Plans were soon made to replace the Tropicana with a baseball stadium and a new casino resort.

===Closure===
The Tropicana&#x27;s original hotel wings from 1957 were closed, without fanfare, in mid-November 2023. They were the oldest resort rooms on the Strip. The rest of the Tropicana ceased operations on April 2, 2024; the casino floor closed at 3:00 a.m., followed by the remainder of the property at 12:00 p.m. At the time of its closure, the Tropicana had 700 workers, some of whom had been with the property for decades.
Prior to closing, Bally&#x27;s chairman Soo Kim said, &quot;The Trop is obviously iconic, but it is, really, in a lot of ways, economically obsolete. It literally is part of the glitz and glamour of Vegas, but it hasn&#x27;t been that for decades.&quot; Katie Dowd of SFGate wrote that &quot;decades of decay have already destroyed what&#x27;s left of the world-famous Tropicana&quot;. Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), noted that, &quot;Hotels built in the 1950s were not designed for the 2020s&quot;. He partly attributed the Tropicana&#x27;s decline to the numerous ownership changes in its later years, which &quot;meant different approaches, different plans. Then it was surrounded by these megaresorts. And in a sense, it tried to have its own niche by not being one of them and having amenities – but not the amenities to the degree the others did.&quot; Despite its age, the Tropicana was profitable at the time of its closure.

A liquidation sale began not long after the property&#x27;s closure, lasting about two months. It included entire furnished suites, as well as various items from the casino floor. Most of the gaming equipment was transferred to other Bally&#x27;s properties. Some items and memorabilia will be donated to local organizations, including UNLV and the Neon Museum; the latter had already acquired a former Tropicana neon sign years earlier.

===Demolition===

Demolition got underway within a month of the property&#x27;s closure. Several hotel structures contained asbestos, which had to be removed prior to demolition. Most of the asbestos had already been removed during renovations and expansions that had taken place over the years. Miller Environmental Inc. removed the remainder and then demolished the low-rise buildings, leaving the towers as the last structures on the site. Miller and GGG Demolition Inc. gutted the buildings to prepare them for implosion, removing plaster and drywall to minimize dust.

The towers were imploded on October 9, 2024, at 2:37 a.m. Demolition was preceded by a ceremony featuring LED and pyrotechnic aerial drones, as well as fireworks from Fireworks by Grucci. The aerial show took approximately five months to plan, with a crew of nearly 100 people on-site to execute it. The towers were imploded by Controlled Demolition, Inc., which has handled Las Vegas implosions for decades.

The towers were built differently and thus required separate approaches. The original 1979 structure was built with a steel frame, which took 490 pounds of explosives to bring down. The 1986 tower consisted of reinforced concrete and required 1,700 pounds of explosives. Approximately 98 percent of the implosion debris is expected to be recycled, with cleanup of the site taking three to four months. The Tropicana marked the first Strip implosion since the Riviera in 2016.

==Redevelopment plans==
===New Las Vegas Stadium===

The Oakland Athletics, a Major League Baseball team, began considering a Las Vegas relocation in 2021, with the Tropicana property as a potential site for a new stadium. In May 2023, after more than a year of negotiations, the Oakland A&#x27;s reached an agreement with Bally&#x27;s and GLPI to demolish the Tropicana for redevelopment. The stadium will occupy nine acres.

The stadium is expected to cost $1.5 billion, and a public financing package for up to $380 million was approved by the state in June 2023. Five months later, the Oakland A&#x27;s relocation to Las Vegas was approved by the MLB. Construction of the stadium is scheduled to begin in April 2025, with completion in January 2028.

===New Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas===
The stadium is expected to occupy of the site, with another being used for a new Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas resort. The remaining would be shared between the stadium and the resort. The original Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas, also on the Strip, was rebranded as Horseshoe Las Vegas in 2022. This occurred after the name rights were sold to Bally&#x27;s Corporation, known prior to that point as Twin River Worldwide Holdings. After acquiring the rights, the company had plans to rename the Tropicana as a Bally&#x27;s property, although this did not pan out.

Bally&#x27;s had more than $3 billion in long-term debt as of April 2024. At that time, the company stated there was no rush to build a new resort on the Tropicana site, instead focusing on other gaming projects, including Bally&#x27;s Chicago and a possible New York property. Bally&#x27;s said work on the Las Vegas resort could begin some time during the stadium&#x27;s construction or at a later point following the latter&#x27;s completion. The company was also open to partnering with another resort operator to begin the project sooner. It has been suggested that the Las Vegas resort could be developed similarly to Bally&#x27;s property in Chicago.

As demolition concluded on the Tropicana, Bally&#x27;s was in the early stages of planning for its replacement, an integrated resort with 3,005 rooms, a casino, and of convention space. The hotel would consist of three towers, each standing 459 feet, to be built in phases. Bally&#x27;s stated that it hoped to finish phase-one in time to coincide with the opening of the stadium, with construction taking approximately two years.

==Labor disputes==
Several bomb incidents occurred at Strip resorts in 1984, amid a labor dispute with local trade unions. The Tropicana was among those targeted, with an early morning blast damaging nine vehicles in its front parking lot. The casino&#x27;s main show, &quot;Folies Bergere&quot;, was also closed for 11 weeks due to the dispute.

&quot;Folies Bergere&quot; closed again in 1989, when its 14-crew musician team went on strike. The crew was represented by the American Federation of Musicians, and walked off the job after their contract expired without a deal for renewal. The closure of &quot;Folies Bergere&quot; affected 170 other workers involved in the show. It soon reopened with the use of taped music in place of live musicians, a practice that the union had opposed. The crew was ultimately fired, saving the Tropicana $600,000 in yearly salaries. The musician strike also affected several other resorts on the Strip. After seven months, the strike ended in 1990 with a new contract agreement.

In 2001, table game dealers at the Tropicana voted to be represented by the Transport Workers Union, which later accused the casino of targeting its supporters. The union&#x27;s representation was decertified in 2002; of 147 dealers, 98 voted to decertify, while 38 voted in support of the union.

The overall workforce at the Tropicana was represented by the Culinary Workers Union. Bill Yung, the founder and chief executive of Columbia Sussex, was opposed to union representation. When his company took over the Tropicana in 2007, it laid off more than 500 workers, including 300 Culinary members. Columbia Sussex also sought givebacks from the union during negotiations for a contract renewal. Talks between the two sides eventually became bitter and prolonged. In 2008, Yung was replaced by Scott Butera, who worked to negotiate a new contract with Culinary.

==Property overview==
The Tropicana occupied , located at the southeast corner of the Tropicana – Las Vegas Boulevard intersection. Tropicana Avenue was originally known as Bond Road, and took on its current name in 1961, at the request of the Tropicana.
In its final years, the casino floor measured . It included 600 slot machines and 19 table games. A section of the casino floor featured a stained-glass ceiling that covered . It was designed by Tony DeVroudes and created by Judson Studios, and was installed in 1979, at a cost of $1 million. Las Vegas architect Joel Bergman later said of the ceiling, &quot;Nothing like that had been done before inside a casino. It changed the texture of design in Las Vegas.&quot; Bergman&#x27;s firm was hired in 2010 to revamp the ceiling. Following the Tropicana&#x27;s closure, the ceiling is expected to be donated to a historic group.

In 1993, the Tropicana added the Wildlife Walk habitat, featuring exotic birds, mammals, and reptiles. It was built in an existing covered walkway linking the two hotel towers.

Nikki Beach, a chain of beach clubs, opened a location at the Tropicana in May 2011. It was aimed at a clientele in the 30-to-40 age range. A nightclub, known as Club Nikki, also opened along with Cafe Nikki. The three facilities were added as part of the Tropicana&#x27;s $180 million renovation. The resort parted ways with the Nikki brand later in 2011, and the nightclub was renamed RPM Nightclub. The other club was soon rebranded as Bagatelle Beach &amp; Supper Club. In 2013, the Tropicana took over operations of the two clubs and renamed them the Havana Room and Beach Club, open only for private events.

===Hotel===

The Tropicana originally opened with a three-story hotel and 300 rooms. The resort was built out in a &quot;Y&quot; shape, with its two hotel wings branching outward from the casino building. A three-story wing extension with 150 rooms, designed by architect Homer Rissman, was added in 1959. Another wing was extended in 1962. A four-story addition with 132 rooms, also by Rissman, was added in 1964. Two major hotel expansions would later occur:
* The Tiffany Tower opened in 1979, with 600 rooms. It was renamed the Paradise Tower in 1986.
* The Island Tower opened in 1986, with 806 rooms. It later became the Club Tower.

The first and second towers are designated as 22 and 21 stories respectively, although both skip the 13th floor due to bad-luck superstition among gamblers.

As part of the 2010 renovation, the resort demolished its 1959 and 1964 wings, the latter to make way for a second entrance and additional parking along Tropicana Avenue. The 20th floor of the Paradise Tower was also renovated to include 6 luxury villas, removing 30 regular rooms in the process. As a result of these changes, the hotel was left with 1,467 rooms in total, down from approximately 1,870.

From 2012 until it closed in 2024, the Tropicana&#x27;s hotel had been affiliated with DoubleTree by Hilton.

===Dining===
A $5 million remodeling project was launched in 1978, and included two new restaurants. Others would debut in the late 1990s, including the Savanna Steakhouse. The Tropicana also opened Pietro&#x27;s, a fine-dining restaurant that would go on to be well received. It eventually closed in 2007 under the resort&#x27;s new ownership, which found it to be under-performing.

The 2010 renovation added several new dining options, including the Italian restaurant Bacio. Legends Steak &amp; Seafood, a restaurant, was updated to become Biscayne Steak, Sea &amp; Wine. In 2017, it was remodeled again to include a bar and lounge. That year, celebrity chef Robert Irvine opened a restaurant, Robert Irvine&#x27;s Public House, and the resort also added Oakville Steakhouse.

===Museums and exhibits===
From 1999 to 2005, the Tropicana was the home of the Casino Legends Hall of Fame. It displayed artifacts and memorabilia from hundreds of casinos, and held induction ceremonies to honor notable Las Vegas entertainers and gaming industry figures. The facility featured 10,000 items. Upon closing, it was quickly replaced by the Las Vegas Historic Museum, which lasted until 2006.

Convention and exhibit space was added in 1973, and an expansion was completed in 2015. The space hosted several exhibits, including &quot;Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition&quot;, which opened in 2005. It was joined in 2006 by &quot;&quot;, a display of preserved human bodies. The two exhibits, both produced by Premier Exhibitions, closed in 2008 to move to the Luxor.

They were replaced in March 2011 by the Las Vegas Mob Experience, an attraction describing the rise and fall of organized crime in Las Vegas, featuring mob artifacts, holograms of famed gangsters such as Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and live actors. After being plagued by technical problems, litigation, and low ticket sales, and going through a bankruptcy and partial closure, the exhibit became known as the Mob Attraction Las Vegas in March 2012. It closed in November 2013.

===Plaza area===

A plaza with tropical landscaping was located at the Tropicana – Las Vegas intersection, in front of the resort and facing the Strip. This area originally featured a water cooling tower, which was covered with a tulip-shaped fountain structure. It stood , and was demolished in 1977, as part of renovation work.

The tropical theme was added in 1991, and included two large statues depicting Easter Island heads. The statues were high and weighed 300,000 pounds each. They were removed in 1996, during a renovation.

The plaza&#x27;s tropical theme was expanded with a Caribbean village facade, which began construction in 1993 and was finished within a year. In 1994, the plaza debuted a free laser light show, accompanied by music and special effects such as fog. Plans were announced in 2013 to build a two-story shopping area on the plaza land, but this project was later scrapped.

===Tropicana Country Club===
The Tropicana Country Club opened in September 1961, on of land. It was located north of the resort, across Tropicana Avenue. The site had consisted of vacant desert land, which was transformed into the golf club over a 10-month period. It included a 70-par course measuring 6,481 yards.

MGM Grand Inc. purchased the country club in 1989, and closed it a year later. The land was redeveloped as the MGM Grand resort and MGM Grand Adventures theme park, both opened in 1993.

==Live entertainment==
The Tropicana opened with the 450-seat Theatre Restaurant, featuring tiered flooring which overlooked a semi-circular stage. It also included glass walls offering a view of the property&#x27;s tropical gardens. The venue opened with singer Eddie Fisher, who was a regular performer there.

Other venues included the Showcase and Blue Room lounges. Jazz performances took place in the latter, which opened in 1965. The Blue Room seated more than 400 people. Notable performers there included Louis Armstrong, Erroll Garner, Benny Goodman, Al Hirt and the Ramsey Lewis Trio.

&quot;The Tropicana Holiday&quot;, a striptease revue starring Jayne Mansfield, opened in 1958. Later that year, the Stardust resort opened on the Strip along with the show &quot;Lido de Paris&quot;, featuring topless showgirls. Inspired by the show&#x27;s success, the Tropicana debuted its own topless revue in 1959, titled &quot;Folies Bergere&quot;. The show was imported from Paris. Aside from the showgirls, &quot;Folies Bergere&quot; also featured other acts, including the Las Vegas debut of magicians Siegfried &amp; Roy (1967) and Lance Burton (1982). The show ran at the Tropicana until 2009, closing shortly before its 50th anniversary. As of 2023, it remains the longest-running show in Las Vegas history.
Several live albums were recorded at the Tropicana, including &quot;Kenton Live from the Las Vegas Tropicana&quot; (1959) by Stan Kenton, &quot;Jackpot!&quot; (1966) by Dave Brubeck, &quot;Standing Ovation&quot; (1969) by Count Basie, &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot; (1970) by the Buddy Rich Big Band, and &quot;America! America! America!&quot; (1978) by Pink Lady.

In 2002, the casino floor debuted &quot;Air Play&quot;, a free show performed several times daily. It featured various entertainers – including jugglers, singers and dancers – who performed on a stage atop a bank of slot machines, with the casino&#x27;s stained-glass ceiling as a backdrop. As part of the show, a track was also installed along the ceiling for acrobatic performances.

===Main theater===

The largest venue at the property was the 1,100-seat Tropicana Theater, which featured the Prince tribute show &quot;Purple Reign&quot; (since 2017) and the Michael Jackson tribute show &quot;MJ Live&quot; (since 2022). The venue opened in 1973 as the Superstar Theater, built to the specifications desired by Sammy Davis Jr. It was renamed as the Tiffany Theatre in 1975. In 2011, it became the Gladys Knight Theater when the singer began a residency at the venue. It was renamed as the Tropicana Theater later that year, after Knight&#x27;s departure. From 2019 to 2022, it hosted the celebrity impersonator revue Legends in Concert and was named the Legends in Concert Theater.

Other productions at the theater have included magician Rick Thomas (1997–2005); magician Dirk Arthur (2005–2010); singer Wayne Newton (2009–2010); percussion group Recycled Percussion (2010–2012); a live production of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2012); &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, the Broadway musical based on the songs of ABBA (2014); &quot;Raiding the Rock Vault&quot;, a musical featuring classic rock songs (2014–2016); illusionist Jan Rouven (2014–2016); and illusionist David Goldrake (2017–2018).

===Comedy clubs===
A showroom on the Tropicana&#x27;s mezzanine level was occupied by the Laugh Factory, a comedy club which offered two nightly stand-up comedy shows, as well as nightly performances by impressionist Rich Little and comic magician Murray Sawchuck. The space opened in 1988 as Rodney&#x27;s Place, a comedy club associated with Rodney Dangerfield, which closed after six months. It then operated as the Comedy Stop from 1990 to 2009. The venue next became the Bobby Slayton Room, offering regular shows by the comedian and several other performers. It then opened as Brad Garrett&#x27;s Comedy Club in 2010. Garrett&#x27;s club departed in 2011 to move to the MGM Grand. The Laugh Factory took over the space in 2012, and continued there until the Tropicana closed in 2024. The Laugh Factory intends to relocate to a new yet-to-be-determined location on the Strip.

<text>Mount Bogong, located in the Alpine National Park and part of the Victorian Alps of the Great Dividing Range, is the highest mountain in Victoria, Australia, at above sea level.

The Big River separates the massif of the mountain from the Bogong High Plains to the south. From the nearby town of Mount Beauty to its summit, Mount Bogong rises more than , thus making it one of the highest peaks in Australia not only in terms of its elevation above sea level, but also in terms of actual base-to-summit prominence.

Mount Bogong is a popular backcountry skiing mountain through winter but only has snow for the mid winter-spring months. It is around by road and walking track or direct to Mount Beauty. Falls Creek and Mount Hotham ski resorts are also nearby. Camping is relatively safe below the treeline but the summit ridgeline is very exposed.

Emergency shelter is also available at Bivouac Hut on the Staircase Spur, and at Cleve Cole, above Camp Creek on the broad ridge to the south of the summit, and Michell&#x27;s Hut on the Eskdale Spur.

==Etymology==
In the Australian Aboriginal Waywurru and Dhudhuroa languages, the mountain is named Warkwoolowler, meaning the mountain where Aboriginal people collected the &quot;boo.gong fly&quot;. Additionally, in the Dhudhuroa language the word Bugung means the brown moth, referring to &quot;Agrotis infusa&quot;.

==Flora and fauna==
The lower slopes of Mount Bogong are covered with tall forests of Alpine Ash (&quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot;) to an altitude of about . From to , woodland and open woodland of Snow Gum (&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;) dominate, and above , the vegetation consists of alpine shrubland, grassland and herbfield.

Animals that live on Mount Bogong have all found some way to adapt to the environment which is very harsh. For example, bogong moths gregariously aestivate in caves throughout the mountain to avoid desiccation. Other animals that live on Mount Bogong include the pygmy possum, smoky mouse, broad toothed rat, powerful owl, spotted tree frog and she-oak skink.

Much of the mountain, especially the northern side, was badly burnt in the 2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires.

==History==

Mount Bogong towers above the Kiewa River valley and is of great significance to the local traditional owners. Parks Victoria states that &quot;Many Aboriginal people have a remarkably rich history of Aboriginal use in the Victorian Alps and a vast knowledge of the cultural sites, oral history and ancestral stories that relate to the alpine region of Victoria. Throughout the many seasons each year, Aboriginal groups would come from as far away as the coast and south west slopes, to meet with the tribes of the mountains for intertribal ceremonies and feasting on Bogong Moths. During these festivities they would exchange cultural objects and materials for tools&quot;.

According to Eddie Kneebone, an indigenous historian, &quot;the Yiatmathong (people) controlled the Kiewa and Mitta Mitta valleys, they also had control of the Alpine region on the Victorian side. Their southernmost boundary extended to Hotham and ran along the highest ridge line of the Alps in an east-west direction. Because Mount Bogong fell within the Yiatmathong territory, permission had to be gained from them by the other tribes participating in the summer feast. Once this was done, the tribes would spend summer in the cooler climate of the mountains feasting on the protein rich Bogong moth&quot;. Kneebone claims that prior to climbing Mount Bogong and the Bogong High Plains, the tribes would gather by the Murray River at Mungabarreena (near modern Albury). After ceremonies, initiations, marriages, trading, settling of disputes, and renewing of alliances and friendships, the groups would walk from Albury to the mountain region to feed on the protein-rich Bogong moths.

Following European settlement, indigenous groups were decimated and survivors were placed onto settlements, often far from the traditional lands. Indigenous visitation to Mount Bogong is generally understood to have finished by the mid19 century. While there was cattle grazing for some time, it was the walkers and then skiers who became the next group to visit the mountain in large numbers.

In August 1936 Mick Hull, Howard Michell and Cleve Cole attempted the first winter crossing of the Bogong High Plains. The group became lost in blizzard conditions and Cole died of hypothermia soon after he and Mick Hull were discovered by a rescue party raised by Michell. Cole was buried on 22 August at the Cheltenham Pioneer Cemetery. The hut commemorating Cole&#x27;s life was completed in 1938, and has served as the hub of back-country skiing and bushwalking exploration of the Bogong area since. Accommodation at the hut is free on a first-in-first-served basis, although donations to The Bogong Club are welcomed. Parks Victoria advises skiers and walkers to carry an alpine-capable tent, and not to rely on accommodation in the huts.

Cole&#x27;s death illustrates the danger of Mount Bogong and of the Victorian Alps in general. The mountains are geologically old and worn. Their low altitude and flattish, rounded tops make for easy skiing and walking, but descent of their steep sides in whiteout conditions can be perilous.

==Ascent routes==
There are many routes up Mount Bogong for hikers, including (clockwise from north west) Staircase Spur, Eskdale Spur, Granite Flat Spur, Long Spur, Duane Spur, and Quartz Ridge. All involve a climb of more than from the saddle or creek at the base of these spurs.

The two main walking trails lead to the summit. The Staircase and Eskdale Spur can both be accessed from a trail that begins at Mountain Creek Picnic Area. It is also possible to access Camp Creek Gap on the Eskdale Spur in a 4WD vehicle along Eskdale Spur Track from Trappers Gap. Both trails are of moderate difficulty. Starting from the picnic area, the Staircase is a return trip, normally taking 6–9 hours return, while the Eskdale Spur is a return trip, normally taking 8–11 hours return.

The Staircase Spur is a difficult ascent due to its steep slopes. From the base of the staircase it is to the summit. Halfway up the staircase is Bivouac Hut which sits about from the summit on a small flat section, it offers emergency refuge, camp sites and a resting spot before heading to the summit.

The Eskdale spur may provide a slightly easier option up to the summit of Bogong with a 4WD vehicle, although walking up from Mountain Creek, it is just a longer way to do the same ascent. With a 4WD you can drive from the bottom of the Staircase Spur at Mountain Creek, through to Camp Creek Gap, from where it is about 2.5 hrs walk to the summit of Bogong, and this is the easiest winter access, although occasionally the 4WD track is covered with snow.

Just over halfway up the Eskdale Spur is Michell Hut, which burnt down during the 2003 bushfires but was later rebuilt. Michell Hut provides emergency refuge, toilet, camp sites and a resting area before the final climb up to where the Eskdale meets Granite Flat Spur at the treeline, where there is also a good, but exposed campsite.

Granite Flat Spur also provides access to the summit. It can be accessed by 4WD either from Eskdale, or by continuing on from Camp Creek Gap around the 4WD track, which is only possible outside of winter. An hour beyond Camp Creek Gap by 4WD will get you to the end of the 4WD track, from which it takes about 1.5 hrs walk to the summit (i.e. it is no quicker than walking up the Eskdale, but you walk less, and drive further).

Above the treeline, both the Staircase and Eskdale Spurs are very exposed, particularly in winter, and they may &quot;ice up&quot; after about 4pm, making progress dangerous.

<text>The Boardwalk Hotel and Casino was a Coney Island-style hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. The property began in 1966, as a Holiday Inn. Norbert Jansen added a gift shop to the hotel in 1972, and later opened the Slot Joynt casino. In 1985, Jansen renamed the Holiday Inn as the Viscount Hotel, part of a U.S. chain. Four years later, he merged Slot Joynt with the Viscount and renamed them as the Boardwalk. It rejoined the Holiday Inn chain in 1994, through a franchise deal which eventually ended in 2002.

A carnival facade was added in 1995, featuring non-functional ride replicas. A 15-story tower was finished in 1996, giving the Boardwalk a total of 653 rooms. The casino was also enlarged, bringing it to . The resort occupied . It was popular for its cheap food and rooms, and its small size compared to nearby megaresorts.

In 1998, the Boardwalk was sold to Mirage Resorts, which later became MGM Mirage. The resort closed on January 9, 2006, to help make way for MGM&#x27;s CityCenter project. The hotel&#x27;s main tower was imploded on May 9, 2006. The former Boardwalk site is now occupied by CityCenter&#x27;s Waldorf Astoria hotel.

==History==
The Boardwalk began as a 138-room Holiday Inn hotel with a restaurant, cocktail lounge, and meeting space with a capacity for 100 people. Located at 3740 South Las Vegas Boulevard, the hotel was designed by architect Homer Rissman, and was completed in 1966. It opened with a six-floor tower.

In March 1966, employees of the Holiday Inn, who were represented by the Culinary Workers Union, began picketing in front of the hotel, alleging that they did not receive wages and conditions that were standard for the area. Holiday Inn denied the claim, stating that wages and conditions were equal to or above local standards. The union ultimately lost its fight.

A second hotel tower opened in 1968, and the hotel later became known as Holiday Inn South and Holiday Inn South Strip, differentiating it from other Las Vegas locations such as the Holiday Inn Center Strip.

In October 1975, the hotel&#x27;s innkeeper died in a fire that was believed to have been started by a cigarette. The fire was confined to the innkeeper&#x27;s room on the fifth floor, and caused approximately $40,000 in damage. Guests of the fifth floor were evacuated, and approximately 10 were treated for smoke inhalation.

Norbert Jansen, former owner of Pioneer Club, had opened a gift shop, Holiday Gifts, at the hotel in 1972. It was later renamed Holiday Gifts South. Avis Jansen, Norbert&#x27;s wife, eventually sought to install 15 slot machines at the gift shop. However, the Nevada Gaming Control Board voted against this proposal in December 1977. She had been rejected due to the fact that her husband was the landlord of the business; he had previously been convicted of tax evasion in the 1960s, and was also involved in a company that filed bankruptcy. By 1981, the Jansens had opened a casino known as Slot Joynt, which later became part of the hotel.

In 1985, with little fanfare, the Jansens renamed the Holiday Inn as the Viscount Hotel, part of a chain with 14 other locations in the U.S. At that time, the six-story hotel included 204 rooms.

In 1989, Jansen proposed the addition of a 21-story working slot machine, the world&#x27;s largest, to be built in front of Slot Joynt. However, this idea was rejected by the Clark County Commission. Despite receiving approval later that year, Jansen decided against the idea due to its rising cost, going from $5 million to $7 million.

===Boardwalk (1989–2006)===

In February 1989, Jansen converted the Viscount and Slot Joynt into the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino. Boardwalk Casino Inc. became a public company in February 1994, following an initial public offering. Two months later, plans were announced for a $9 million renovation and expansion that would include the enlargement of the casino, which measured .
The hotel rejoined the Holiday Inn chain through a new franchise deal later in 1994, and a Coney Island theme was added shortly thereafter. A carnival facade was built in 1995, adding non-functional replicas of a parachute drop, roller coaster, and Ferris wheel, as well as a giant clown face and retail shops. The casino was also expanded, and a 15-floor, 451-room tower was finished in 1996. That year, Jacobs Entertainment, Inc. made a $9 million investment in the Boardwalk. In 1997, the resort added the 370-seat Surf Buffet, which ran a television commercial starring professional boxer Butterbean.

Jansen, speaking about his earlier proposal for a giant slot machine, said in 1995: &quot;It&#x27;s not officially dead. But I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s dying, that I probably won&#x27;t see it in my lifetime&quot;. Jansen died of cancer in January 1997, at the age of 78. Avis Jansen continued to operate the gift shop until the Boardwalk&#x27;s closure.

The Boardwalk occupied . In December 1997, Mirage Resorts agreed to purchase the resort and three adjacent parcels for $135 million. The $105 million Boardwalk sale was approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission in June 1998. At the time, the Boardwalk included 650 employees, 653 rooms and a casino. Minor improvements were planned for the Boardwalk, with no immediate plans to replace it.

A decision to expand or replace the Boardwalk was expected within three or four years. However, Mirage Resorts was acquired by MGM Grand, Inc. in 2000, forming MGM Mirage. The newly formed company delayed its plans for a redevelopment of the Boardwalk site, choosing instead to focus on its new Borgata resort, opened in Atlantic City in 2003. MGM took its time on a Boardwalk replacement, which was contingent on the success of Borgata. The Holiday Inn name was dropped in 2002.

In November 2004, MGM announced plans for CityCenter, a mixed-use project that would be built on , including the Boardwalk site. The Boardwalk closed on January 9, 2006. It had been popular for its cheap food and rooms, as well as its small size compared to nearby megaresorts. Columnist John L. Smith of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; called the Boardwalk &quot;a testament to the local belief that even a terribly tacky joint -- one with an Atlantic City theme, for crying out loud -- can grind out a cash flow if it happens to be located in the heart of the action on the Strip&quot;.
The Boardwalk&#x27;s main hotel tower was imploded by Controlled Demolition, Inc. on May 9, 2006. Much of the debris from the imploded structure was recycled as building material for CityCenter, including its foundation. Glass and bathroom fixtures were shipped to other countries for re-use. Former lieutenant governor Lonnie Hammargren, a collector of Las Vegas memorabilia, purchased the Boardwalk&#x27;s Ferris wheel, a Surf Buffet sign, the resort&#x27;s wedding gazebo, and a 15-foot-high lighthouse. The facade&#x27;s clown head was demolished. The Boardwalk site is now occupied by CityCenter&#x27;s Waldorf Astoria hotel.

==Notable entertainers==
The Unknown Comic performed at the Boardwalk in the mid-1990s. Elvis impersonator Trent Carlini entertained in the casino&#x27;s 100-seat Lighthouse Showroom from 1996 to 2001, sharing the venue at one point with magician Dixie Dooley. Purple Reign, a Prince tribute show, ran in the same venue from 2001 to 2006.

<text>Diadem Peak is a peak located in the Sunwapta River Valley of Jasper National Park, Canada. Diadem Peak is essentially the high point of a ridge leading down from the slightly higher Mount Woolley (). This peak was the first 11,000er north of the Columbia Icefield to be climbed and one of the few peaks in the Canadian Rockies to be climbed before 1900.

The mountain was named in 1898 by the first ascent team of J. Norman Collie, Hugh Stutfield and Hermann Woolley. Upon reaching the summit, they discovered a crown (diadem) of snow about high covering the almost flat layer of rocks on top.
== Climbing history ==

In the summer of 1898, J. Norman Collie, Hugh Stutfield and Herman Woolley, had made their way up Woolley Creek and initially had their sights on reaching the top of Mount Woolley by climbing the icefield that separates Mt. Woolley from Diadem Peak. However, after a brief downpour which forced them to seek shelter among some rocks, they had just begun preparing the rope for ascending the icefield when a large collapse of ice from the summit made them switch their objective to Diadem Peak. The party ascended the southeast ridge along loose shale and ice, eventually finding a small rock rib that took them to the summit on August 25. Collie recorded an initial elevation of using a mercurial barometer. With the use of crampons, the difficulties of the southeast ridge route are reduced by following a shallow snow gully up much of the way.

In 1962, William Buckingham and Bill Hooker, ascended Diadem Peak by what is now known as the South Ridge route. This route initially traverses loose rock ledges to reach a snow/ice couloir which is followed until the glacier levels off and is no longer fractured. Traversing left across rock to the glacier, the route follows the glacier up to the Woolley-Diadem col where Diadem&#x27;s summit is reached after an easy ascent up the ridge. Jim Elzinga and Jeff Marshall made the first ascent up a mixed route on the North face of Diadem in July 1981. This route is known as &quot;Humble Horse&quot; (IV, 5.7, W4).

==Geology==
Diadem Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Diadem Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C.

<doc id="705291" wikidata="Q1064873" url="?curid=705291" title="Excalibur Hotel and Casino">
<text>Excalibur Hotel and Casino is a casino hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International. The resort features a medieval castle theme and is named after King Arthur&#x27;s mythical Excalibur sword. Property features include a casino, a 28-story hotel with 3,981 rooms, and various restaurants.

The $290 million property was developed by Circus Circus Enterprises. The castle theme was conceived by company founder William Bennett, and the resort was designed by Veldon Simpson. Bennett and the design team traveled to castles throughout Europe for inspiration. Construction began in October 1988, and the resort opened on June 19, 1990. It was the largest hotel in the world until the opening of the nearby MGM Grand in 1993.

The Excalibur has hosted numerous shows, including &quot;Thunder from Down Under&quot;, which opened in 2002 and is the longest-running male revue in Las Vegas. &quot;Tournament of Kings&quot;, a medieval-themed show featuring sword fights and jousting, is the longest-running dinner show on the Strip.

==History==
The Excalibur occupies approximately , located along the Las Vegas Strip at the southwest corner of the Tropicana – Las Vegas Boulevard intersection. The property was once the proposed site of the Xanadu, a 1,730-room resort announced in 1975. The Xanadu was never built, as its developers could not secure a deal with the county on the sewer infrastructure such a large project would have required.

Circus Circus Enterprises purchased the vacant site in May 1988, and announced plans a month later to build a castle-themed resort on the land. The company held an international contest to determine the name of the new resort. More than 180,000 entries were made, and the winning name, &quot;Excalibur&quot;, was selected from more than 33,000 names. It is named after King Arthur&#x27;s mythical Excalibur sword.

Groundbreaking for the Excalibur took place on October 7, 1988. Marnell Corrao Associates served as the general contractor. The $290 million resort opened on June 19, 1990, receiving 30,000 visitors on its first day. The Excalibur was among new entertainment-oriented megaresorts to open on the Strip, continuing a trend started by the Mirage in 1989.

On March 21, 2003, Josh Ford of Los Angeles hit the largest Megabucks Jackpot to date of US$39.7 million at Excalibur.

Circus Circus Enterprises became Mandalay Resort Group in 1999, and ownership of the Excalibur was passed to MGM Mirage in 2005, after it acquired the company. The resort&#x27;s new owner was subsequently renamed MGM Resorts International in 2010. Ownership of the Excalibur, along with many other MGM properties, was transferred to MGM Growth Properties in 2016. Vici Properties acquired MGM Growth and its properties in 2022, while MGM Resorts continues to operate them under a lease agreement.

==Design==

The medieval castle theme was conceived by Circus Circus founder William Bennett, and the resort was designed by Veldon Simpson. Bennett studied old castle renderings, and he and Simpson visited castle sites in England and Germany for design inspiration. Simpson&#x27;s Excalibur design was inspired particularly by Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany. Trademark experts were hired to avoid replicating the castle designs at Disneyland and Disney World. The Excalibur&#x27;s medieval architecture includes stone turrets, and a moat and drawbridge.

Yates-Silverman handled the interior design. The firm conducted library research into castles and also visited such buildings in Europe, in addition to film studios. According to Michael Erickson, design director at Yates-Silverman: &quot;We were basically looking for the same level of design that you would find in film. If you designed rooms as they literally looked during the traditional period, they would be dark, dingy and dirty. You have to romanticize it a little bit and take more of a theatrical approach.&quot;

==Features==

The Excalibur has 3,981 rooms, spread across four 28-story towers built out in a square footprint. The resort originally opened with 4,032 rooms, making it the largest hotel in the world. This record was surpassed by the 1993 opening of the MGM Grand, located diagonally across from the Excalibur. A hotel remodeling project began in 2006, and was scheduled to conclude four years later. In accordance with guest feedback, the multi-phase project removed castle-themed elements from the rooms in favor of an understated design.

The Excalibur&#x27;s casino measures . It opened with 2,630 slot machines, and more than 100 table games. In 2008, the Excalibur removed its live poker dealers and replaced them with automated tables manufactured by Pokertek, through a deal that lasted 10 months. The new tables appealed primarily to a lower-paying clientele and beginners, prompting the resort to bring back live poker, which was preferred by experienced players and those willing to spend more.

Upon its opening, Bennett described the Excalibur as an upgrade from the Circus Circus resort in Las Vegas, while still targeting the same family demographic. Family friendly attractions included an arcade, an indoor medieval-themed midway, and motion simulator rides taking place in two theaters, each seating 48 people.

South of the Excalibur are two other MGM properties, the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The three resorts are connected via the Mandalay Bay Tram. Of the three, Excalibur is considered the low-budget property.

===Restaurants===
The Excalibur included 17 restaurants upon opening. In 1997, the resort added the Steakhouse at Camelot, which would go on to become a Zagat award winner. At that time, it also included the second-largest buffet in Las Vegas, seating more than 1,300. In 1998, the Excalibur announced a partnership with World Championship Wrestling to open a wrestling-themed restaurant at the resort. The $2 million WCW Nitro Grill opened in May 1999, and operated for 16 months, featuring regular appearances from professional wrestlers during that time.

In 2007, Dick&#x27;s Last Resort opened an location at the Excalibur. The band Lynyrd Skynyrd would also license its name to a new restaurant at the resort. Lynyrd Skynyrd BBQ &amp; Beer opened in December 2011, along with American Burger Works, both managed by the same company. The two restaurants operated for nine months, eventually closing due to financial problems.

Buca di Beppo opened at the Excalibur in 2011. A year later, the resort debuted its Castle Walk food court, which introduced several eateries not already on the Strip. At , it was among the largest food courts on the Strip. Because the Excalibur had an exclusive deal with Pepsi, the food court housed one of the few McDonald&#x27;s in the world to vend the soft drink rather than its competitor, Coca-Cola. The McDonald&#x27;s eventually closed in 2016.

Johnny Rockets opened in 2014, taking the space formerly occupied by American Burger Works. Later that year, the resort completed a $6 million renovation of its buffet, which seats 610. Fatburger opened its first Strip location in 2022, at the Excalibur.

==Live entertainment==
===Medieval shows===
The Excalibur has featured two medieval-themed shows since its opening, both taking place in a 900-seat dinner theater. Jousting has been a signature aspect of both shows. Performances take place in a dirt arena, and meals are served medieval-style, without utensils.

The original show, &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Tournament&quot;, included 45 actors and 15 horses upon its opening. The show closed in January 1999, after approximately 5,600 performances. It was replaced a month later by a revamped version known as &quot;Tournament of Kings&quot;. More than $2 million was spent to update the show and remodel the arena. Both shows were created by the French-born producer Peter Jackson, who died shortly before &quot;Tournament of Kings&quot; was launched. His son, Patrick Jackson, took over as producer.

&quot;Tournament of Kings&quot; incorporates pyrotechnics and various stunt work, including sword fights. As of 2008, the cast included up to 38 humans and 11 horses. The show had a total of 30 horses, kept in an air-conditioned facility behind the resort. As of 2010, it was the only show in Las Vegas to feature horses. &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Tournament&quot; had featured female horse riders, although it would not be until 2014 that &quot;Tournament of Kings&quot; introduced its first female rider.

&quot;Tournament of Kings&quot; is popular among families. It is the Strip&#x27;s longest-running dinner show, and also one of its longest-running shows in general. The Excalibur is the world&#x27;s top buyer of Cornish game hens, having served 6.7 million of them through the show from its original opening in 1990 through 2018.

===Dragon show===
In 1993, the resort debuted a three-story animatronic dragon, part of a show in which it faced off against a mechanical statue of Merlin. The show took place at the moat entrance, and was performed hourly each night. The fire-breathing dragon was created by Alvaro Villa&#x27;s company, AVG Inc, and took nine months to build. A six-story dragon had previously been considered. The dragon and Merlin effects were generally considered underwhelming. In 2002 and 2003, readers of the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; named the show as the city&#x27;s worst attraction. The show ended around 2003, although the dragon remains intact, hidden beneath the drawbridge.

===Other shows===
&quot;Thunder from Down Under&quot; opened at the resort in July 2002, and is the longest-running male revue in Las Vegas. Since 2011, the &quot;Thunder from Down Under&quot; venue has also been host to &quot;The Australian Bee Gees Show&quot;, a tribute to the original Bee Gees musical group. The venue originally seated 375 people. It was renovated in 2019 and named the Thunderland Showroom, with seating expanded to 425. Magician Hans Klok began performing in the space later that year, sharing it with &quot;Thunder from Down Under&quot; and the Bee Gees show. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Klok departed the property in 2020, as he felt that pandemic-related restrictions would hinder revenue. Magician Mac King took his place in 2021, starring in a comedy magic show.

Other shows at the resort have included the Royal Lipizzaner Stallions, a group of Lipizzaner horses which performed various maneuvers for spectators during the 1990s. Catch a Rising Star, a chain of comedy clubs, opened a location at the Excalibur in 2001, operating there for nearly three years. The club was added in response to guest feedback. Louie Anderson also performed comedy acts in the resort&#x27;s showroom, starting in 2006. He entertained there until 2010.

&quot;Fuerza Bruta&quot;, a show featuring acrobats, opened in March 2019. It was performed in a on-site tent, with a standing-only capacity of 950 people. The show was signed for a six-month run, but ended a month after its debut, due to poor ticket sales; each performance had an average of only 50 guests.

==In popular culture==
In 2003 and 2004, the Excalibur was used as a filming location for the television program &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. The 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; features fictional resorts based on those located along the Strip, including a castle-themed property called the Come-A-Lot modeled after the Excalibur.

<text>Park MGM, formerly Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, is a megaresort hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada, United States. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International. It was developed by Mirage Resorts and Circus Circus Enterprises, both later acquired by MGM.

The resort opened as the Monte Carlo on June 21, 1996. Its design was based on the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco. In January 2008, a fire occurred on the rooftop of the 32-story hotel. The fire, caused by welding, forced the evacuation and closure of the Monte Carlo, and 13 people were treated for smoke inhalation. The resort lost nearly $100 million because of the fire, including damage and lost revenue from the closure. It reopened three weeks later. The top floor suffered water damage and received a total renovation, reopening as Hotel32 in August 2009. It operated as a hotel-within-a-hotel, offering 50 rooms.

In June 2016, MGM announced that it would renovate the Monte Carlo and rebrand it as Park MGM, with the name change taking effect on May 9, 2018. The two-year renovation, costing more than $550 million, concluded in December 2018. Hotel32 was removed, and the top four floors of the tower were rebranded as NoMad Las Vegas, a new hotel-within-a-hotel. Park MGM includes a casino and 2,700 rooms, not counting another 293 at NoMad, which brings the total to 2,993.

Magician Lance Burton served as the Monte Carlo&#x27;s longtime headliner, entertaining in the 1,200-seat Lance Burton Theatre from 1996 to 2010. A new venue, the Park Theater, opened in 2016 and has since been renamed Dolby Live. The theater seats 5,200, and was built on the former site of the Lance Burton Theatre.

==History==
Park MGM originally operated as the Monte Carlo. A portion of the resort&#x27;s land was once occupied by the Desert Rose motel, opened in 1953. Another portion of the future resort site was occupied by a golf course, built in the 1960s, for the nearby Dunes hotel-casino.

===Monte Carlo (1996–2018)===
Mirage Resorts purchased the Dunes and its golf course in November 1992, and closed them both a couple months later. In May 1994, Mirage and Gold Strike Resorts announced a joint venture to build a then-unnamed resort on part of the former golf course. The Desert Rose was also purchased and demolished to make way for the resort.
Ground was broken in March 1995. Circus Circus Enterprises acquired Gold Strike three months later and took over its role of managing the project. Gold Strike had hoped to name the project the Grand Victoria, the same name as the casino being developed by the company in Illinois, but that idea was discarded because of potential confusion with the MGM Grand. &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Victoria Bay&quot; were reported as likely names. Details about the property were revealed in July 1995, including that it would be named the Monte Carlo and feature &quot;Belle Époque&quot; architecture, based on the unaffiliated Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco.

The Monte Carlo opened to the public at midnight on June 21, 1996, following an invitation-only pre-opening celebration, including a fireworks show. Originally proposed as a $250 million project, the final cost ballooned up to $344 million.

The resort aimed for mass appeal, offering European luxury rooms to middle-income guests, whereas the Monte Carlo in Monaco is tailored to high rollers. The Las Vegas property became popular among tourists as a second-choice hotel, handling overflow from other resorts. As of 2009, the Monte Carlo print advertising campaign featured intentionally misspelled French words (&quot;tray sheek&quot;) coupled with glamorous images. The campaign&#x27;s tagline was &quot;Unpretentiously luxurious&quot;.

Mirage and Circus Circus split the resort&#x27;s profits, and operations were overseen by the latter company. MGM Grand, Inc. acquired Mirage in 2000, forming MGM Mirage and acquiring 50-percent ownership of the Monte Carlo. MGM acquired the other half in 2005, after purchasing Mandalay Resort Group (formerly Circus Circus Enterprises).

====2008 fire====
The rooftop of the hotel&#x27;s 32-story tower contains most of the resort&#x27;s air-conditioning, as well as electrical equipment. An architectural facade, measuring three stories, was built along the top of the tower to hide the rooftop machinery. The facade was part of the resort&#x27;s original construction. It was made with a foam known as exterior insulation finishing system (EIFS), which is widely used, including on other resorts along the Las Vegas Strip.

A three-alarm rooftop fire began on January 25, 2008, shortly before 11:00 a.m. Approximately 120 firefighters responded to the blaze, which was put out by 12:15 p.m. Certain parts of the fire could not be reached from the roof; in these cases, firefighters instead had to break open hotel-room windows to reach the flames.

The Monte Carlo had been occupied by approximately 5,000 guests and 950 employees when the fire broke out. The entire resort was evacuated and closed indefinitely until repairs could take place. Thirteen people were treated for smoke inhalation. The evacuation process was generally praised by experts. Local fire safety protocols, adopted after the 1980 MGM Grand fire, were credited for the organized evacuation and minimal injuries. However, some guests complained of a delay in initiating the evacuations, and others said they initially did not hear any fire alarms; the alarms only activate on floors where smoke is detected, as well as the floors immediately above and below. Evacuated hotel guests were offered accommodations at MGM&#x27;s other Strip properties.

Much of the fire damage occurred to the hotel tower&#x27;s upper exterior, which was left blackened. Large chunks of EIFS fell from the tower; the structure was built according to the 1991 Uniform Building Code, which allowed a thicker amount of foam compared with modern standards. A later analysis found that a non-approved resin had been used in two areas along the roof during initial construction, which helped spread the fire at a faster rate. Many rooms also suffered water damage and had to be stripped down for repair work, which began a day after the fire.

Welding had been taking place on the roof and was the cause of the fire. A team of contractors had been cutting steel for a walkway along the roof&#x27;s edge, to be installed for window-washing. Pieces of molten steel fell onto the roof, sparking a fire which spread to the facade. According to fire officials, the workers had failed to acquire a permit for their work and failed to use a slag mat, designed to catch molten drippings. The contracting company said its welders had a permit and worked safely and responsibly.

Because the fire was determined to be accidental, no citations were issued by the fire department. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined the contractor $18,000, alleging it broke nine workplace safety laws. However, the agency&#x27;s review board overturned nearly all of the citations, while acknowledging that the contractor failed to take necessary precautions to prevent the fire spread.

Revenue losses were initially estimated at $1.1 million for each day of the Monte Carlo&#x27;s closure. The resort ultimately lost nearly $100 million because of the fire, including damage and lost revenue from the closure. However, company losses were minimal due to MGM&#x27;s portfolio of Strip properties. The fire also had no negative impact on other businesses along the Strip, which operated as normal. The Monte Carlo partially reopened on February 15, 2008, and much of the property was operational within a week.

===Park MGM (2018–present)===

In 2015, construction was underway on MGM&#x27;s nearby T-Mobile Arena. The Monte Carlo was viewed as the gateway to the venue, prompting MGM to consider renaming the resort, which was seen as underutilized. The Park, a dining and entertainment district, opened in April 2016. Built in between the Monte Carlo and New York-New York, it serves as the Strip entrance to T-Mobile Arena. At the time, MGM chairman and chief executive officer Jim Murren said about the Monte Carlo, &quot;We are not going to name it something from somewhere else. Those days are over. This is Las Vegas; we are at the top of the list of entertainment cities. We are not second to anybody. We&#x27;re not going to have a property themed after a city from a far-away place.&quot;

In June 2016, MGM announced that the Monte Carlo would be rebranded as Park MGM, a reference to The Park. The resort received a two-year renovation which took place in phases, allowing the property to remain open. The name change took effect on May 9, 2018, although construction remained ongoing. Renovations took place throughout the entire resort, and cost more than $550 million, before concluding in December 2018.

During 2016, ownership of the Monte Carlo and other MGM properties was transferred to MGM Growth Properties (later acquired by Vici Properties in 2022), while MGM Resorts continued to operate it under a lease agreement.

Nevada casinos were ordered to close in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the state. Nevada casinos began reopening a few months later. When Park MGM reopened on September 30, 2020, it instituted a non-smoking policy, becoming the only casino resort on the Strip to be smoke-free. This was done to attract a non-smoking clientele who dislike the cigarette smoke that is typically associated with casinos. The timing for such a decision was considered appropriate, as there was support for smoke-free policies amid the pandemic. The non-smoking policy had previously been considered two years earlier, until MGM passed on the idea. Smoking is still permitted in designated outdoor areas.

==Features==

Park MGM includes a casino. Upon its initial opening in 1996, it featured 2,200 slot machines, 95 table games, a high-limit gaming area, a race and sports book, and a bingo room with seating for 550.

The resort interior included the Street of Dreams, a French-themed area featuring cobblestone walkways, gas lights, and gargoyles. The property featured of retail space divided into three sections, including the Street of Dreams. The facade along the Strip featured fountains, staircases and arches. This was removed in 2013, making way for restaurant space.

The resort&#x27;s pool area included a wave pool and lazy river. The CityCenter Tram was added in 2009, connecting Monte Carlo with two other MGM properties, CityCenter and the Bellagio. The poker room was closed in 2017, as the Bellagio and CityCenter already offered such facilities. As Park MGM, the resort updated its sports book to resemble a sports bar and offer food. The updated property also added of convention space.

In 2018, Houston Hospitality opened On the Record, an speakeasy and nightclub. It has capacity for approximately 1,000 people, and includes a double-decker bus converted into a DJ booth. In 2019, restaurateur Bricia Lopez opened Mama Rabbit, a bar specializing in tequila and mezcal. The name is a reference to Mayahuel, a female deity who is mother to a group of rabbits known as the Centzon Tōtōchtin.

===Hotels===
The Monte Carlo opened with 3,014 rooms, and now has 2,700 as Park MGM.

The property has featured a hotel-within-a-hotel on two occasions. Following the 2008 fire, the 32nd floor was stripped down in order to repair water damage. The entire floor was renovated and rebranded as . A renovation of the floor had already been planned at the time of the fire, and the incident prompted a complete rebuild.
Hotel32 opened on August 10, 2009, and was aimed at a higher-end clientele compared to the Monte Carlo, with room rates going up to $6,000 per night. The hotel had 50 rooms, including suites and penthouses. Rooms featured an assistant, limo service, and Wii gaming consoles. The floor also included Lounge32, overlooking CityCenter. Hotel32 was removed during the resort&#x27;s conversion into Park MGM.

As part of the Park MGM project, the top four floors were rebranded as through a partnership with the Sydell Group, which owned the NoMad hotel in New York City. Discussions with Sydell had been ongoing for three years before the partnership was announced in 2016. NoMad Las Vegas had a soft opening on October 12, 2018, and most of its amenities were fully operational a month later.

The Park MGM property has a total of 2,993 rooms, including 293 at NoMad Las Vegas. The latter is considered separate from Park MGM, with its own lobby and pool. NoMad rooms were designed to resemble urban apartments, and are higher priced compared with those at Park MGM. The hotel includes a ground level casino, bar, and restaurant. The NoMad&#x27;s casino features the only high-limit gaming area on the property, and a Tiffany glass ceiling was retained from when the area operated as part of the Monte Carlo.

===Restaurants===
The Monte Carlo opened with six restaurants, including a 250-seat steakhouse and a 700-seat buffet featuring a Moroccan design. In addition, it offered a 210-seat food court. It also featured the Monte Carlo brewery and pub, which sold its own beers. It rebranded as The Pub in 2009, and removed its microbrewery; construction of the adjacent CityCenter forced the removal of the large brewing tanks in order to create more room.
Dragon Noodle Co. &amp; Sushi Bar debuted with the Monte Carlo. It was remodeled in 2009 and updated to include cocktail waitresses dressed as anime characters. In 2008, the resort debuted Brand, a steakhouse by The Light Group, while an ice bar opened two years later.

Several restaurants, as well as the ice bar, closed in 2017 to make way for new eateries, part of the Park MGM conversion. Two new restaurants opened in 2017: Bavette&#x27;s Steakhouse &amp; Bar, which originated in Chicago; and Primrose, a French restaurant seating more than 300. Also added was Eataly, part of a chain of Italian restaurants. MGM had tried for 10 years to bring the chain to one of its Strip resorts. Chef Roy Choi opened Best Friend, his first Las Vegas restaurant, at the end of 2018.

==Live entertainment==
Magician Lance Burton headlined at the Monte Carlo from its opening until September 4, 2010. He had previously performed at the Hacienda resort, also on the Strip, since 1991. Burton originally signed a 13-year contract with the Monte Carlo, which built him a 1,200-seat venue known as the Lance Burton Theatre. His show was successful, closely associating him with the Monte Carlo. In 2009, Burton signed an extension with the resort for up to six years. However, he departed the property in 2010, due to disagreements with resort management. Burton had reportedly been asked to reduce his budget, to which he replied that he would rather end the show.
Other entertainers in the Lance Burton Theatre included comedian Frank Caliendo, who performed there from 2009 to 2011. Following Burton&#x27;s departure, the Jabbawockeez dance crew began performance of their residency at Monte Carlo, entitled &quot;MÜS.I.C&quot;. It took place in Burton&#x27;s former venue, renamed the Monte Carlo Theater. In early 2011, it was announced that the Blue Man Group would renovate and take over the venue. The Jabbawockeez relocated to a temporary tent structure on the Monte Carlo property, with seating for 867. As scheduled, the Jabbawockeez departed the resort in 2013. The Blue Man Group performed at Monte Carlo from October 2012 to October 2015.
In 2015, as part of the Park MGM conversion, construction began on a new 5,200-seat venue known as the Park Theater. The former Lance Burton venue was demolished to make way for the Park Theater, which opened on December 17, 2016. It was renamed Dolby Live in October 2021, in partnership with Dolby. The theater has had residencies by Ricky Martin (All In), Cher (Classic Cher), Lady Gaga (Enigma), Aerosmith (Deuces Are Wild), Maroon 5, and the first concert residency by Janet Jackson (Metamorphosis).
==In popular culture==
The Monte Carlo made several media appearances, including the films &quot;Dance with Me&quot; (1998), and &quot;&quot; (2004). It was also in the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, serving as the main location in the season six episode &quot;Three of a Kind&quot; (1999). In the finale of &quot;The Amazing Race 15&quot; (2009), teams had to count out $1 million worth of poker chips at the Monte Carlo to receive their next clue.

<doc id="705305" wikidata="Q363117" url="?curid=705305" title="Martin Brest">
<text>Martin Brest (born August 8, 1951) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. After his feature debut, &quot;Going in Style&quot; (1979), he directed the action comedies &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984) and &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (1988), which were critical and commercial hits.

Brest then directed &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992), starring Al Pacino, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. He followed it with &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; (1998), which received mixed reviews. Brest&#x27;s next film was &quot;Gigli&quot; (2003). After disagreements between Brest and Revolution Studios, creative control was taken from him, resulting in a radically re-written and re-shot version of the original film being released, which became his first and only non-profitable film and, in fact, a major box office bomb, receiving scathing reviews. It remains his most recent film to date.

==Background==
Brest was born to Eastern European immigrant parents in a working-class neighborhood in the Bronx in 1951. He was influenced by watching &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; as a child, saying in a 2023 interview, &quot;I was a kid watching it in a household that was economically not that different than in the show. I felt like it was a show made for my neighborhood. And that character of Ralph Kramden really touched me, that angry soul whose spirit blossoms&quot;. Brest graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1969 and from New York University&#x27;s School of the Arts in 1973. His New York University undergraduate student film, &quot;Hot Dogs for Gauguin&quot; (1972), starring a then unknown Danny DeVito and with a small part by then unknown Rhea Perlman, was one of 25 films chosen in 2009 by the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress to &quot;be preserved as cultural, artistic and/or historical treasures&quot; and is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Brest attended the AFI Conservatory, where he graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in 1977.

==Career==
Brest&#x27;s major studio debut was &quot;Going in Style&quot; (1979), which starred George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg. Brest was then hired to direct &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983), which starred Matthew Broderick, but he was fired three weeks into production amid conflicts with the film&#x27;s executive producer, and replaced with John Badham.

The dismissal from &quot;WarGames&quot; left Brest highly pessimistic about his career, until he was recruited by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer to direct &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984), starring Eddie Murphy. The film grossed over $300 million worldwide and received Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy) and for Best Actor (Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, Eddie Murphy), as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. In 2024 it became the second of Brest&#x27;s films to be chosen by the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress to &quot;be preserved as cultural, artistic and/or historical treasures.&quot;

Brest was then in pre-production for &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988), when he cast Tom Cruise for the role opposite Dustin Hoffman, before Barry Levinson eventually directed the film.

Brest&#x27;s next film was the action-comedy &quot;Midnight Run&quot; (1988), starring Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin. The film was another critical and commercial success, earning Brest another Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy as well as a Best Actor Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy nomination for De Niro.

His work on &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992) earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. The film also won Golden Globes for Al Pacino and screenwriter Bo Goldman, as well as a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Chris O&#x27;Donnell. In addition, the film received four Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay (Adapted), with Al Pacino winning Best Actor.

Brest&#x27;s next film, &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; (1998), starring Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, was a loose remake of 1934&#x27;s &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot;. The film had an American box-office return of $44.6 million, taking in an additional $98.3 million overseas for a worldwide total of $142.9 million.

Brest wrote and directed &quot;Gigli&quot; (2003), starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. During filming, production company Revolution Studios took creative control from him, resulting in a radically re-written and re-shot version of the original film being released. That version became one of the more notorious films of its time, with a scathing critical reception. A 2014 article in &quot;Playboy&quot; observed that in the then-eleven years since &quot;Gigli&quot;″s release, Brest &quot;went Full Salinger&quot;, appearing to have left the entertainment industry completely, without any further credits or major public appearances to his name. However, in 2021, he appeared as a featured guest at a screening of &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; and &quot;Midnight Run&quot; in Los Angeles, where he was interviewed by fellow filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. Two years later, he gave an interview to &quot;Variety&quot; in which he reflected:
Brest has received the American Film Institute&#x27;s Franklin J. Schaffner Achievement Award, which &quot;celebrates the recipient&#x27;s extraordinary creative talents and artistic achievements.&quot;

His essays about art and artists have appeared in various books.

<doc id="705310" wikidata="Q691491" url="?curid=705310" title="Paris Las Vegas">
<text>Paris Las Vegas is a casino hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment. Property features include a casino, 3,672 hotel rooms, a 1,400-seat performance theater, and various restaurants. The Paris-themed resort also includes a half scale replica of the Eiffel Tower, rising . Replicas of other Paris landmarks are featured as well, including the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, the Paris Opera House, and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

Construction of Paris Las Vegas began on April 18, 1997, and the resort opened on September 1, 1999. It is located on , directly south of the Horseshoe Las Vegas resort, also owned by Caesars. In 2024, one of the Horseshoe hotel towers was renovated to become part of Paris Las Vegas, which previously had 2,916 rooms.

==History==
The site of Paris Las Vegas was originally occupied by the Galaxy Motel and a small strip mall; the latter had included the Little Caesar&#x27;s casino and a stand-alone sports book known as Churchill Downs. Bally Entertainment announced the Paris resort project on May 16, 1995. It was initially set to begin construction later that year, with the opening expected for late 1997. It would be built on just south of the company&#x27;s Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas resort.

Chanen Construction, based in Phoenix, Arizona, was hired as construction manager. However, Hilton acquired Bally Entertainment in late 1996, and Chanen was fired from the Paris project amid the ownership change. Construction of Paris Las Vegas eventually began on April 18, 1997, with Perini Building Company as the general contractor. In 1998, Hilton transferred ownership of its gaming properties – including Paris and Bally&#x27;s – to Park Place Entertainment, a corporate spin-off which would be renamed Caesars Entertainment in 2003.

Paris Las Vegas opened on September 1, 1999, following a private VIP party which included Nevada governor Kenny Guinn, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman, French actress Catherine Deneuve, and businessman Donald Trump. Paris Las Vegas employed 4,200 workers. The resort project cost $785 million. Unlike high-end resorts opening on the Strip around the same time, Paris targeted a middle-class clientele.
Paris was built as a sister property to Bally&#x27;s. The two resorts are connected, and initially shared operations, including a single gaming license and hotel reservation system.

In late 1999, a fraud lawsuit was filed against the resort by Steven Mattes, a high roller who gambled there during its opening weekend. Mattes accused the casino of reneging on an agreement to provide him with a $2 million line of credit. A jury ruled in his favor in 2002, awarding him $8 million. However, the verdict was challenged by the resort and ruled erroneous in 2003. The case was summarily dismissed the following year. Mattes appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear it in 2007.

In 2001, the resort&#x27;s performance theater hosted the first BET Awards show.

The Flag of France had hung from the resort&#x27;s exterior since opening, but was briefly removed in 2003, amid France&#x27;s opposition to the invasion of Iraq.

Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment acquired Caesars Entertainment in 2005 and took on the latter&#x27;s name in 2010.

A power outage occurred in November 2016, lasting more than 12 hours and trapping 11 people in elevators throughout the resort, before being rescued by fire crews. A work crew had been making floor repairs in the resort&#x27;s boiler room and accidentally drilled into the property&#x27;s main power and backup generator lines, causing the outage. Another outage occurred in October 2020, after rodents interfered with an off-site transfer switch near the resort. Six people had to be rescued from elevators, and power was restored within three hours.

In 2022, Paris and Bally&#x27;s became the first Strip resorts to host the World Series of Poker, which returned to the resorts for 2023 as well.

==Design==

Paris Las Vegas was designed by architect Joel Bergman. The Paris-themed facade along the Strip was created by Keenan Hopkins Suder &amp; Stowell Contractors Inc. According to Dave Suder, &quot;Paris Las Vegas was not intended to be a true, historical recreation of the real buildings in Paris, France. Everything was stylized, sized and proportioned to fit the project. But, the actual detail that went into the work is very detailed. The sculpted elements were carefully executed.&quot; The facade includes replicas of the Arc de Triomphe (two-thirds scale), the Louvre, the Paris Opera House, and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay. The designers traveled to France to study these landmarks.

The resort&#x27;s half-scale Eiffel Tower replica rises , with an observation deck at , capable of holding up to 96 people. The tower also includes a restaurant, situated 11 stories above ground. The tower&#x27;s legs measure at their base, and three of them rest within the casino floor. Upon the resort&#x27;s opening, the three interior legs contained a sports book, a casino host area, and a bar, respectively. The fourth leg rests outside the resort along the Strip, and initially served as a ticket booth for guests to visit the observation deck.
Bergman consulted Gustave Eiffel&#x27;s blueprints for the original Eiffel Tower. His firm created the replica&#x27;s architectural design, while its structural design came from the Las Vegas-based Martin &amp; Peltyn. It was built by Schuff Steel, based in Phoenix, using 5,000 tons of steel. Although the replica tower was created with welded steel, it also includes faux rivets to match the design of the original.

Interior design of the resort&#x27;s public spaces was handled by Yates-Silverman, with assistance from Kovacs &amp; Associates of Chicago. The interior was inspired by the Paris street scene of the 1920s, and includes restaurants and shops located in a recreation of the Rue de la Paix shopping district. The casino floor also features a replica of the Pont Alexandre III bridge.

The resort&#x27;s main sign along the Strip depicts a Montgolfier hot-air balloon, with a diameter of . The $6 million sign, rising , was designed by Bergman and built by Las Vegas-based Federal Signs.

Paris mayor Jean Tiberi was impressed with the project&#x27;s size and design. However, some French residents expressed pessimism about the project, stating that Paris could not be adequately recreated.
==Features==

Paris Las Vegas includes a casino. To increase foot traffic, a new entrance along the Strip was added in 2003. The project included a new lounge and nightclub known as Risqué, which closed in 2010. Chateau Nightclub and Gardens opened the following year with of space, including outdoor areas overlooking the Strip.

The original hotel tower is 34 stories, and includes 2,916 rooms. An $87 million hotel renovation, covering 1,600 rooms, was underway in 2019. In 2023, it was announced that the 756-room Jubilee tower of the adjacent Horseshoe Las Vegas (formerly Bally&#x27;s) would be incorporated into Paris Las Vegas as the Versailles tower.

The 26-story Jubilee tower was originally completed in 1981. A $100 million renovation project was launched to convert the building. Its height would be increased 17 feet with a Parisian-style roof, and a skybridge would connect to the existing Paris tower. Balconies were also added to rooms on the older tower&#x27;s west-facing side, overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio. The tower conversion was finished in 2024, bringing the total room count to 3,672.

===Restaurants===
Paris Las Vegas opened with 10 restaurants, 7 of which served French food. Other choices included Chinese, Italian, and Mediterranean.

Among the original restaurants was Tres Jazz, by businessman Robert L. Johnson. It was the fourth in a chain of restaurants owned by his television channel BET. The restaurant included live jazz music and a television broadcasting the BET on Jazz network. With Tres Jazz, Johnson became the first black person to own a restaurant inside a Strip resort. BET was sold in 2001, and Johnson announced plans to purchase Tres Jazz from the network along with two partners. They opened a new restaurant later that year, replacing Tres Jazz.

Since the resort&#x27;s opening, it has also featured Mon Ami Gabi, part of a chain of French bistros. The Eiffel Tower Restaurant seats 250 people and has long been overseen by French chef Jean Joho. Chef Gordon Ramsay opened his first Las Vegas restaurant, Gordon Ramsay Steak, at Paris in 2012. It was successful, leading to four other restaurants along the Strip.

Hexx Kitchen &amp; Bar opened in 2015, and includes outdoor dining along the Strip. The adjacent Hexx Chocolate &amp; Confexxions opened as the first &quot;bean-to-bar&quot; chocolate maker in Nevada. An addition to Hexx Kitchen, Alexxa&#x27;s Bar, opened three years later. Beer Park also opened in 2016, featuring food and more than 70 varieties of beer.

A revamp of the restaurant offerings was underway in 2021. Vanderpump à Paris, by reality television star Lisa Vanderpump, opened in March 2022, marking her second Strip restaurant. Nobu also opened its second Strip location at Paris a month later. Other new restaurants included the 194-seat Bedford by Martha Stewart, marking her first restaurant venture. She was involved in the recipes and design, the latter inspired by her 1925 farmhouse in Bedford, New York.

==Shows and entertainers==
Paris Las Vegas opened with a 1,400-seat performance theater. The venue has hosted numerous shows, though with minimal success. &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, a popular musical in England and France, opened at the resort in January 2000. The Las Vegas run received mixed reviews, selling only 130,000 tickets before closing in July 2000.

&quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, a jukebox musical, opened in 2004. It closed the following year, as Harrah&#x27;s sought to revamp the entertainment offerings at the newly purchased resort. &quot;The Producers&quot;, a Broadway musical comedy, ran from 2007 to 2008. To suit the Las Vegas demographic, the show was condensed to 90 minutes, down from the 150-minute Broadway version. During the show&#x27;s first three months, the cast included actor David Hasselhoff as Roger De Bris, until he departed due to scheduling conflicts. &quot;The Producers&quot; would be the last resident show at Paris until March 2010, when Barry Manilow began a two-year residency.
The musical &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; opened in 2012, and lasted until 2016. It was replaced a year later by &quot;Circus 1903&quot;, replicating various circus acts from the early 20th century and incorporating life-sized elephant puppets. Although popular elsewhere, the Las Vegas version saw minimal success and concluded its run in January 2018, five months after opening. &quot;Circus 1903&quot; was replaced shortly thereafter by &quot;Inferno&quot;, a pyrotechnic show starring Joe Labero and others as they performed fire-related stunts. &quot;Bat Out of Hell: The Musical&quot; opened at Paris in September 2022. Like previous shows at the resort, it closed due to low ticket sales in January 2023.

Aside from the theater, hypnotist Anthony Cools also performed in his own venue at the resort from 2005 to 2020, and had also opened a topless variety show there in 2007. Jeff Civillico performed a comedy show in the Anthony Cools Showroom from 2017 to 2019.

Until 2006, the resort interior offered free entertainment from various performers, including street musicians, mimes, and living statues.

A free five-minute light show debuted in 2019, illuminating the Eiffel Tower in red, white, and blue. The show, which cost $1.7 million to create, recurs throughout each night.

<text>James Zachariah George (October 20, 1826August 14, 1897) was an American lawyer, writer, U.S. politician, Confederate politician, and military officer. He was known as Mississippi&#x27;s &quot;Great Commoner&quot;.

==Biography==
James Z. George was born in Monroe County, Georgia, but moved to Noxubee County, Mississippi at age eight when his widowed mother remarried, and two years later, to Carroll County, Mississippi, where he received his education in the common schools. He served as a private in the Mexican–American War under Colonel Jefferson Davis, and participated in the Battle of Monterey. On his return, George read law and was admitted to the bar. In 1854 he became a reporter of the Supreme Court of Mississippi and, over the next 20 years, George prepared a 10-volume digest of its cases.

George was a slave owner. As a member of the Mississippi Secession Convention, George signed the Secession Ordinance. During the Civil War, George first served as Captain of Company C, 20th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, before resigning his commission in the Confederate Army to serve as a Brigadier general of the Mississippi State Troops in October, 1862. Frustrated by the disorganization of the State Troops and facing disrespect from Confederate officers, George left the State Troops service in November 1863, and rejoined the Confederate service as a colonel of the 5th Mississippi Cavalry. He was captured twice and spent two years in a prisoner of war camp, where he conducted a law course for his fellow captives. After the war, he returned to Mississippi and resumed the practice of law. In 1879 he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Mississippi and immediately was chosen as chief justice by his colleagues.

From 1881 until his death, George represented Mississippi in the United States Senate, where he was recognized for his skills in debate, helped frame the future Sherman Anti-Trust Act, introduced the bill for agricultural college experiment stations, and encouraged the establishment of the Department of Agriculture. Alarmed by the proposed Lodge Bill, which would have provided for federal supervision of elections, he campaigned in Mississippi for a constitutional convention in order to legally disenfranchise African-Americans, without resorting to violence, fraud, and other extralegal measures that had been used prior. He was a major figure during the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1890 itself, leading a hardline faction promoting the disenfranchisement of blacks without disenfranchising whites (as opposed to those who wanted to apply property and educational requirements to whites and blacks), and successfully defended the constitution before the Senate and the Supreme Court.

George died in Mississippi City, Mississippi, where he had gone for health treatment. He is buried, along with his wife, Elizabeth Brooks (Young) George, in Evergreen Cemetery in North Carrollton, Mississippi. George&#x27;s wife Elizabeth was the granddaughter of Col. William Martin Jr. of Tennessee, and the great-granddaughter of General Joseph Martin, an early Virginia explorer and Revolutionary War commander.

In 1931, the state of Mississippi donated a bronze statue of George to the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection.

The J. Z. George High School in North Carrollton, Mississippi is named in his honor, which is less than from his burial place. In addition, George County, Mississippi, is also named in his honor.

<text>Robert Allan Monroe, also known as Bob Monroe (October 30, 1915 – March 17, 1995), was an American radio broadcasting executive who became known for his ideas about altered states of consciousness and for founding The Monroe Institute which continues to promote those ideas. His 1971 book &quot;Journeys Out of the Body&quot; is credited with popularizing the term &quot;out-of-body experience&quot;.

Monroe developed Hemi-Sync which he claimed could facilitate enhanced brain performance.

He was one of the founders of the Jefferson Cable Corporation, the first cable company to cover central Virginia.

==Biography==
Robert Allan Monroe was born in 1915 in Indiana and grew up in Lexington, Kentucky, and Columbus, Ohio. His mother was a non-practicing medical doctor, cellist, and piano player. His father was a professor of Romance Languages who led summer tours to Europe.

According to his third book &quot;Ultimate Journey&quot;, he dropped out of Ohio State University in his sophomore year due to a hospital stay for a facial burn that caused him to fall behind in his studies. During almost a year away from college, he tried to find work. He returned to Ohio State to graduate after having studied pre-med, English, engineering and journalism.

He married Jeanette, a graduate student and daughter of a lawyer, in 1937, and divorced her in 1938 or 1939. He married Mary Ashworth, a divorcee with a daughter Maria, in 1950 or 1951. They had Bob&#x27;s only biological child together, daughter Laurie. They divorced in 1968. He then married Nancy Penn Honeycutt, a divorcee with four children. They remained married until her death from breast cancer on August 15, 1992.

Monroe developed ulcers in young adulthood and so was classified 4F (unfit for service) during World War II. He spent the war years working for a manufacturing company that designed a flight-simulator prototype. He wrote for an aviation column in &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine and was given a job with the National Aeronautic Association (NAA), for whom he produced a weekly radio show called &quot;Scramble!&quot;, the primary purpose of which was to interest youth in aviation.

In 1953, Monroe formed RAM Enterprises, a corporation that produced network radio programs, as many as 28 programs monthly, principally in dramatic and popular quiz shows.

In 1956, the firm created a Research and Development division to study the effects of various sound patterns on human consciousness, including the sleep state. Monroe was especially attracted to the concept of sleep-learning. This was a natural direction to take, applying to this new area the audio production methods used in the firm&#x27;s commercial activity. The purpose was to find more constructive uses for such knowledge than was ordinarily available, and the results of this research have become internationally known.

==First out-of-body experiences==

According to his own account, while experimenting with sleep-learning in 1958, Monroe experienced an unusual phenomenon, which he described as sensations of paralysis and vibration accompanied by a bright light that appeared to be shining on him from a shallow angle. Monroe went on to say that this occurred another nine times over the next six weeks, culminating in his first out-of-body experience (OBE). Monroe recorded his account in his 1971 book &quot;Journeys Out of the Body&quot; and went on to become a prominent researcher in the field of human consciousness. Monroe later authored two more books on his experiments with OBE, &quot;Far Journeys&quot; (1985) and &quot;Ultimate Journey&quot; (1994).

==The Monroe Institute==

In 1962 RAM enterprises moved to Virginia, and a few years later changed the corporate name to Monroe Industries. In this location it became active in radio station ownership, cable television, and later in the production and sale of audio cassettes. These cassettes were practical expressions of the discoveries made in the earlier and ongoing corporate research program.

In 1985 the company officially changed its name, once again, to Interstate Industries, Inc. This reflected Monroe&#x27;s analogy of how the use of Hemi-Sync serves as a ramp from the &quot;local road&quot; to the &quot;interstate&quot; in allowing people to go &quot;full steam ahead&quot; in the exploration of consciousness, avoiding all of the stops and starts.

The research subsidiary was divested and established as an independent non-profit organization, The Monroe Institute, later in 1985. Interstate Industries, Inc. remains a privately held company, now doing business as Monroe Products. His daughter, Laurie Monroe, continued her father&#x27;s program until her death in 2006. Under the current direction of another of Monroe&#x27;s daughters, Maria Monroe Whitehead, Monroe&#x27;s stepson, A. J. Honeycutt, and Teresa West, president of Monroe Products, the company&#x27;s objective is to continue to expand the Hemi-Sync line of products and their benefits into markets worldwide.

The Monroe Institute (TMI) is a nonprofit education and research organization devoted to the exploration of human consciousness, based in Faber, Virginia, United States. Upwards of 20,000 people are estimated to have attended TMI&#x27;s residential Gateway program during its first thirty years. TMI claims a policy of no dogma or bias with respect to belief system, religion, political or social stance. The institute is housed in several buildings on of land south of Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.

In 1978, the U.S. military evaluated TMI and arranged to send officers there for OBE/OOBE training. In 1983, it sent additional officers.

The Institute has an affiliated professional membership, and also publishes scientific papers on a subset of its own studies of altered states of consciousness. 

==Coverage==
In 1994, a front-page article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported confirmation from the former director of the Intelligence and Security Command of the U.S. Army sending personnel to the institute. It also stated the opinion of the head of the Zen Buddhist temple in Vancouver British Columbia that &quot;Gateway students can reach meditation states in a week that took [me] 30 years of sitting&quot;.

A reporter for &quot;The Hook&quot;, weekly newspaper for Charlottesville, Virginia, who visited The Monroe Institute said, &quot;...with a few exceptions, the only &#x27;normal&#x27; people with whom I could fully identify were the trainers, who seemed remarkably well-grounded for people whose day-to-day experiences include astral projection and disembodied spirits&quot;.

The reporter also concluded that &quot;there is something significant being developed at the Institute. Whether it&#x27;s just a brilliant guided meditation complete with trance-inducing stereoscopic sound, or a doorway to a world of spirit entities, I cannot say&quot;.

==Hemi-Sync==
In 1975, Monroe registered the first of several patents concerning audio techniques designed to stimulate brain functions until the left and right hemispheres became synchronized. Monroe held that this state, dubbed Hemi-Sync (hemispherical synchronization), could be used to promote mental well-being or to trigger an altered state of consciousness. Monroe&#x27;s concept was based on an earlier hypothesis known as binaural beats and has since been expanded upon a commercial basis by the self-help industry.

&quot;Hemi-Sync&quot; is short for &quot;Hemispheric Synchronization&quot;, also known as &quot;brainwave synchronization&quot;. Monroe indicated that the technique synchronizes the two hemispheres of one&#x27;s brain, thereby creating a &#x27;frequency-following response&#x27; designed to evoke certain effects. Hemi-Sync has been used for many purposes, including relaxation and sleep induction, learning and memory aids, helping those with physical and mental difficulties, and reaching altered states of consciousness through the use of sound.
The technique involves using sound waves to entrain brain waves. Wearing headphones, Monroe claimed that brains respond by producing a third sound (called binaural beats) that encouraged various brainwave activity changes. In 2002, a University of Virginia presentation at the Society for Psychophysiologial Research examined Monroe&#x27;s claim. The presentation demonstrated that EEG changes did not occur when the standard electromagnetic headphones of Monroe&#x27;s setup were replaced by air conduction headphones, which were connected to a remote transducer by rubber tubes. This suggests that the basis for the entrainment effects is electromagnetic rather than acoustical.

Replicated, double-blind, randomized trials on anesthetized patients have found Hemi-Sync effective as a partial replacement for fentanyl during surgery. A similar study found it ineffective at replacing propofol, however.

<doc id="705315" wikidata="Q1822425" url="?curid=705315" title="Leyland P76">
<text>The Leyland P76 is a large car that was produced by Leyland Australia, the Australian subsidiary of British Leyland. Featuring what was described at the time as the &quot;standard Australian wheelbase of 111 inches&quot;, it was intended to provide the company with a genuine rival to large local models like the Ford Falcon, the Holden Kingswood, and the Chrysler Valiant. But, due to the first real fuel crisis and demand far exceeding the supply, Leyland rushed the assembly process with the first of the P76s to come off the assembly line, resulting in poor build quality and some reliability problems. The combination of the rushed assembly, fuel crisis and strikes at the component manufacturers&#x27; factories, resulted in the Leyland P76 being labelled a lemon, despite being named &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year in 1973. By 1974, sales of the P76 had slumped and BMC decided to end the production of the P76. Although the P76 has been labelled a lemon in Australian motoring history, it is viewed by some as an iconic Australian car and has a loyal following. 

In 1969, Leyland Australia was given the go-ahead to build a large car for Australia. At the time of the car&#x27;s launch, it was reported that Leyland Australia had an accumulated deficit equivalent to £8.6 million, and had borrowed the same amount again in order to fund the development of the P76. The P76 was designed and built from scratch with a fund of only A$20m. This was also a decade of serious financial and operational challenges for parent company British Leyland back in Britain. Commercial success for this car was therefore seen as crucial to the survival of Leyland in Australia.

Launched in 1973, the P76 was nicknamed &quot;the wedge&quot;, on account of its shape, with a large boot, able to easily hold a 44 gallon drum. Although station wagon and &quot;Force 7&quot; coupé versions were designed, these never went into mass production.

==Naming the P76==
The name of the P76 derived from the car&#x27;s codename while in development (Project 76). The official line was that the P76 was an original Australian designed and built Large Family Car, with no overseas counterpart and that P76 stood for &quot;Project 1976&quot;.

The Rover SD1 (released in 1976) shared several engineering features with the P76 – including MacPherson strut front suspension, the aluminium V8 engine and a live rear axle.

The P76 itself was, however, out of production by 1976. An alternative theory is that P76 were simply the first three digits of Lord Stokes&#x27; National Service number (Donald Stokes was Chairman of British Leyland at the time).

==Automotive forebears==
Before the P76, Leyland Australia and its corporate predecessor BMC (Australia) had not successfully fielded a direct competitor in the large-car sector which then dominated the Australian car market. Previous attempts had been mounted with the 1958 Morris Marshal (a rebadged Austin A95); the 1962 Austin Freeway and Wolseley 24/80 (the Freeway was an Austin A60 with Riley 4/72 tail lights, a unique full-width grille and a 2.4-litre 6-cylinder version of the 1622 cc B-series engine; the Wolseley was a 6-cylinder version of the Wolseley 16/60); and the 1971 Austin &quot;X6&quot; Tasman and Kimberley (facelifted Austin 1800 with the 6-cylinder 2.2-litre E-series engine).

Each of these cars was a compromise and the motoring public overwhelmingly preferred the locally established Holden and Ford products. Nonetheless, the Freeway, 24/80 and the X6 each developed a loyal niche following.

==Design and engineering==
The car was designed by Giovanni Michelotti. The entry-level P76 featured an enlarged 2663cc 121 bhp (83 kW) version of the 6-cylinder engine from the smaller Austin Kimberley and Austin Tasman. The top-of-the-line 192 bhp (143 kW) aluminium 4416 cc V8 unit was unique to the P76, and was a derivative of the ex-Buick V8 that was powering the Rover 3500 and Range Rover. Leyland Australia cited a weight advantage approaching for the P76, most of which was attributed to the lighter weight of the aluminium engine block when compared to the cast-iron blocks (with bigger displacements) of the V8s from Chrysler, Holden and Ford. It was hoped that the weight advantage would feed through into superior fuel economy and extended tyre life. Nevertheless, the car was a full-size car in Australian terms, for which class leading boot/trunk capacity was claimed.

Safety equipment preceded the forthcoming Australian Design Rules, and featured front discs as standard on all models, recessed door handles and full-length side-intrusion reinforcements on all doors.

Transmissions for the car were all bought in from Borg-Warner Australia who were already also supplying transmissions to Ford and Chrysler.

Notwithstanding the advertising slogan (&quot;Anything but average&quot;) the P76&#x27;s engineering followed conventional lines.

It did offer a combination of features which were advanced in this category in Australia at the time: rack-and-pinion steering, power-assisted disc brakes, MacPherson-strut front suspension, front-hinged bonnet, glued-in windscreen and concealed windscreen wipers, as well as the familiar Australian-made Borg Warner gearboxes (including 3-speed column shift) and a live rear axle.

Particular attention was paid to structural rigidity, a British Leyland engineering strength. This goal was aided by a conscious effort to reduce the number of panels needed to build the car&#x27;s body—a remarkably low 215, reportedly only five more than for a Mini.

At the time P76 production ceased, Leyland was developing a V6 version to replace the E6 variant. The V6 was derived from the 4.4-litre P76 V8, with the two rear cylinders chopped off.

==Performance in the marketplace==
Despite the V8 model winning the &quot;Wheels&quot; Car of the Year for 1973, sales of the P76 were adversely affected by a variety of issues. The controversial new Labor government was fuelling rapid inflation; industrial action was affecting component manufacturers and production at Leyland Australia&#x27;s plant in Zetland. Also, the release of the P76 coincided with the 1973 oil crisis, when fuel prices increased dramatically. As a result, demand for all larger cars subsided.

Hence, notwithstanding generally favourable press and public reaction to the car, sales did not reach expectations.

British Leyland announced plans to sell P76 in the UK. However, production ceased before these plans could come to fruition.

The car achieved success in the 1974 World Cup Rally—winning the Targa Florio section and placing 13th overall. Leyland Australia celebrated this victory by releasing a limited edition Targa Florio model: the V8 Super with a limited slip differential, sports wheels and steering wheel, as well as special paintwork, including side stripes.

Gerry Crown and Matt Bryson won the Classic Category of the 2013 Peking to Paris Endurance Rally in their Leyland P76 with a time of 237:30:10

Gerry Crown and Matt Bryson also finished Second on the 2015 Road to Mandalay classic car rally, winning the Malaysian Cup for being the fastest car.
==Unreleased P76 derivatives==

Although development had started much earlier – the Force 7 coupé was announced in 1974 but eventually only 10 pre-production coupés survived. By the time of the factory closure in 1974, one Force 7 was already in England for secret testing, Leyland Australia kept one example and finally donated that coupé to an Australian museum with some other components of the P76 production line and the remaining eight coupés were offered for sale to private buyers in an auction after the factory had closed. The handbooks had even been printed and were offered for mail order sale by the auctioneers. There was to have been a base six-cylinder Force 7, a more powerful Force 7V with the V8 unit, and a range-topping Tour de Force. All the surviving cars are the &quot;mid&quot; range Force 7V. It was unusual in that it had full seating for five adults and a large rear hatchback, the first of its kind produced in Australia. It shared few body panels with the sedan.

At the time of launch, the company announced the intention of introducing a station wagon/estate version later that same year, and at least three, prototype station wagons (estate cars), which shared much of the sedan&#x27;s structure and body panels but with more upright rear door frames, were built: one was broken up by Leyland Australia for examination of the body strength, one was crash tested by Ford Australia for Leyland to gain part of the registration certification and the last and only surviving example was eventually used as a factory hack until it was sold at the same auction as the Force 7s as part of a pair of cars which included the last car made.

The wagon and the &quot;last&quot; car remain in private collections and the wagon is currently undergoing basic restoration. All of the coupés sold at auction did not have registration compliance plates fitted to them as final registration testing and approval had not been completed on either station wagon or coupe bodies. Currently – in 2018 all 10 coupés and the single wagon survive.

==New Zealand and the end of the line==
The Leyland plant at Zetland closed in October 1974, and production of the P76 ceased, although CKD (completely-knocked-down) assembly continued in Petone, New Zealand, in exchange for NZ-assembled Rover P6s that were shipped to Australia. In New Zealand, the P76 was successfully sold in V8 form only in Deluxe, Super and Executive forms, until August 1976. Other P76s were imported into NZ as complete cars. NZ-built P76s can be identified by a &#x27;Z&#x27; stamped onto the chassis plate immediately after the 076 model designation – i.e. 076Z. After production ended, surplus V8s were sold off by local distributor New Zealand Motor Corporation, and were popular as boat engines.

Leyland Australia produced 56 or more Force 7 coupés, the majority of which were crushed at the factory to enhance the value of the eight that Leyland auctioned in 1975. All of them still exist, and are regularly driven by their private owners. Another car, an Omega Navy one with white trim, was sent to Britain and used by Lord Stokes for some time. It was later sold to a private collector, who later sold the car to a collector in New Zealand, which is where it resides now. Another one is at the National Motor Museum, Birdwood in South Australia, on permanent loan from Leyland Australia.

A smaller, medium-sized car was also planned, called the &quot;P82&quot;. Styling for that car became a competition between Michelotti and Leyland Australia&#x27;s own design department. In 1982, claims were made in some motoring media that Leyland in Britain had decided on Michelotti&#x27;s version, but the ex-head of Leyland Australia&#x27;s design department was unaware of any such decision. The car was intended to replace the Morris Marina in Australia, but only one prototype and some styling mock-ups were ever produced. At least two experimental V6 engines were made, one being based on a cut-down Rover V8 of about 2.6 L capacity, and another based on the actual P76 V8 motor at about 3.3 L. Conceived as a high volume/profit car, the P82 was supposed to have many body styles over the same basic structure, and was to be offered in 4, V6 and V8 forms, dependent on body style. After the Australian plant closed, the prototype car was reported to have been sent to Rover in Britain for examination before being destroyed. Just before the plant closure in 1974, and its subsequent takeover by the Australian military, Leyland Australia&#x27;s styling department were still working on the P82 styling, and one single 1/5 scale clay model of the P82 survives, in the sedan &quot;short front and rear&quot; variant.

==P76 today==
The P76 continues to have a loyal following of owners who have great enthusiasm for the car. There are at least seven P76 owners clubs in Australia and New Zealand. The New Zealand P76 Owners&#x27; Club was founded in 1983.

After production of the P76 ceased, Leyland Australia limited its local production to the Mini and Mini Moke, both produced at Enfield, along with commercial vehicles and buses.

<text>The Japanese Super Formula Championship is a formula racing series held primarily in Japan. It is considered to be the pinnacle of single-seater racing in Japan or Asia as a whole, making it one of the top motorsport series in the region. The series is sanctioned by the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF) and managed by Japan Race Promotion (JRP). As of 2024, Super Formula is the second fastest racing series in the world, after Formula One.

The first Japanese top formula championship was held in 1973 as the All-Japan Formula 2000 Championship. In 1978, the series transformed into the All-Japan Formula Two Championship, and again in 1987, into the All-Japan Formula 3000 Championship. For the most part, these Japanese racing series closely followed their European counterparts in terms of technical regulations. The JRP was established in 1995, and began managing the series in 1996, under its new name, the Formula Nippon Championship. This began what is commonly known as the modern era of the series, which has seen it become more independent with regard to technical regulations. The series&#x27; name was changed again in 2013, to Super Formula (officially Japanese Championship Super Formula until 2016).

==History==

=== Background ===
In Japan, touring and sports car racing was very popular throughout the 1960s. The Japanese Grand Prix was originally held as an event for touring and sports cars, and was immediately established as the largest motor racing event in the country during its original run between 1963 and 1969. On the other hand, formula car racing had a more difficult time being established in the nation&#x27;s motorsport landscape. The inaugural JAF Grand Prix at Fuji Speedway in 1969 was Japan&#x27;s first major single-seater race. And in 1971, the Japanese Grand Prix was reformatted into an event centered around formula car racing. Neither event managed to be as popular with spectators as the Japanese Grand Prix was during its time as a sports car race.

===All-Japan Formula 2000 (1973–1977)===

In 1973, the Japan Automobile Federation established the All-Japan Formula 2000 Championship as the first top-level formula racing series in Japan, to promote the sport of formula car racing in the country.

The series was based on the European Formula Two Championship. But unlike European F2, which only allowed the use of racing engines based on mass production models, the JAF approved the use of purpose-built racing engines from manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Motors.

===All-Japan Formula Two (1978–1986)===

In 1976, the FIA modified the Formula Two regulations to allow the use of purpose-built racing engines. With this change, the reasoning behind the name &quot;Formula 2000&quot; had disappeared, which led to the series being renamed the All-Japan Formula Two Championship from 1978.

These early years of formula racing in Japan were led by drivers such as Kunimitsu Takahashi, Kazuyoshi Hoshino, Masahiro Hasemi, Keiji Matsumoto, and Satoru Nakajima, who would go on to become the first Japanese driver to compete full-time in the Formula One World Championship. During the transition from Formula 2000 to Formula 2, a number of foreign drivers from the European F2 circuit began competing in and winning races in the Japanese series. 1981 European F2 champion Geoff Lees became the series&#x27; first non-Japanese champion when he won the All-Japan F2 title in 1983.

The Suzuka Formula Two Championship (established in 1977 as the Suzuka Formula 2000 Championship) was held concurrently at all events staged at Suzuka Circuit, to compete against the Fuji Grand Champion Series. During its existence from 1977 to 1986, it was considered to be of equal prestige to the All-Japan Formula 2 Championship.

====1987 championship====
When European Formula Two ended in 1984, its Japanese counterpart did not follow suit immediately. The JAF considered starting a new Formula Two series from 1988. However, all entrants ran Formula 3000 cars in 1987. So, the 1987 Formula Two Championship was cancelled due to no entry of any cars for that format.

===All-Japan Formula 3000 (1987–1995)===
Switching to the open Formula 3000 standard in 1987, the All-Japan Formula 3000 Championship officially started in 1988.

During the late 1980s, a number of factors contributed to a surge in popularity for Japanese Top Formula racing. Honda-powered Formula One teams began winning multiple championships. The Japanese Grand Prix was reintroduced to the Formula One calendar in 1987, and that same year, Satoru Nakajima began competing full-time in F1. Fans began following the series through Fuji Television&#x27;s broadcasts of Formula One, resulting in an increased interest in all forms formula racing. Combined with the asset-driven bubble economy of the 1980s, the All-Japan Formula 3000 Championship attracted several entrants and investors.

Veteran drivers such as Hoshino, Hasemi, Takahashi, and Matsumoto were succeeded by a new generation of Japanese talents, led by 1988 champion Aguri Suzuki, and 1991 champion Ukyo Katayama - who would each go on to enjoy significant tenures in Formula One. The prosperous conditions within All-Japan F3000 also attracted many promising young drivers outside of Japan to compete in the series. Among those drivers included future Formula One Grand Prix winners Jean Alesi, Johnny Herbert, Eddie Irvine, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen. The most notable of these young drivers from outside Japan, however, was future seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher, who made a one-off appearance at Sportsland Sugo in 1991.

The eventual burst of the bubble economy led to a decline in the series&#x27; popularity during the early to mid 1990s. Japanese and European regulations paralleled one another until 1996, when the International Formula 3000 series became a one-make format to lower costs.

===Formula Nippon (1996–2012)===

In 1995, Japan Race Promotion (JRP) was established by Fuji Television, and became the new promoter and organising body of Japanese top formula racing, recognised by the JAF. As F3000 went down the path of a spec formula series abroad, the JRP opted to continue with the previous F3000 regulations which allowed for open chassis and engine competition. For 1996, the first full season under the management of JRP, the series changed its name to Formula Nippon.

Many of the top drivers in Formula Nippon continued to race in sports cars and touring cars as their predecessors had done in years past. Pedro de la Rosa became the first &quot;double champion&quot; of Japan in 1997 when he won both the Formula Nippon and All-Japan GT Championship GT500 titles in the same calendar year. Satoshi Motoyama and Richard Lyons would later accomplish the same feat in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

Drivers continued to use Formula Nippon as a stepping stone into Formula One including the aforementioned de la Rosa, Ralf Schumacher, Shinji Nakano, Toranosuke Takagi, and Ralph Firman. But by the late 2000s, Formula Nippon&#x27;s status as a pathway into Formula One had diminished, and the series was greatly effected by the Lehman Shock (the term used in Japan to describe the 2007-08 global financial crisis) - going from 20 cars in 2008 to 13 in 2009.

=== Super Formula (2013–present) ===
On 5 August 2012, the JRP announced that the series would change its name from Formula Nippon to Super Formula in 2013, stating a &quot;desire to establish the series on an equal footing with the FIA Formula One World Championship and the IZOD IndyCar Series as the undisputed, standard-bearer top formula racing in Asia.&quot;

The series experienced renewed international interest when 2015 GP2 Series champion, Stoffel Vandoorne, entered full-time in 2016 with Docomo Team Dandelion Racing. Vandoorne would finish his season with two race victories before making the step up to F1 with McLaren in 2017. A year later, 2016 GP2 Series champion Pierre Gasly entered the series, bringing Red Bull sponsorship with him to Team Mugen. Gasly finished 2017 as the Rookie of the Year, with two wins, and finished runner-up in the standings by half a point.

Felix Rosenqvist, Álex Palou, and Patricio O&#x27;Ward later became IndyCar Series race winners after racing in Super Formula. Palou, who was the 2019 Rookie of the Year, went on to win the IndyCar Series championship in 2021, 2023, and 2024.

Liam Lawson, the 2023 Super Formula series runner-up, drove in Formula One for AlphaTauri for parts of the 2023 and 2024 seasons, and will drive full-time in 2025 for Red Bull Racing.

== Scoring system ==
In 2020, Super Formula adopted a new top-ten scoring system similar to the one used in Super GT, awarding 20 points to the race winner. Bonus points were given to the top three qualifiers in every round; three points for pole position, two for second place, and one for third place. 

A top-six points system was used in All-Japan F3000 and Formula Nippon from 1988 to 2006, inspired by the contemporary Formula One points system. Beginning in 2007, the series followed Formula One once again and paid out points to the top eight finishers. A bonus point was awarded to the polesitter starting in 2008, during which the regular points system was changed again to award the top ten finishers and give 15 points to the race winner in standard events. The points system reverted back to a top-eight format from 2009–2019, though some rounds would have special points payouts.

==Car specifications==
===Cars===

Until 2002, Formula Nippon was an open formula category, where a variety of chassis builders, engine manufacturers, and tyre manufacturers could compete. Chassis were supplied by Lola, Reynard, and G-Force. Mugen-Honda supplied the vast majority of the engines along with Cosworth and Judd. Bridgestone, Yokohama, and Dunlop supplied teams with tyres. However, the series began adopting more spec components. Bridgestone became the series&#x27; sole tyre supplier beginning in 1997, and in 1998, Mugen-Honda became the sole engine supplier (though open tuning was still allowed). Chassis remained an open formula until 2003, after Reynard declared bankruptcy and G-Force withdrew from the series. The Lola B03/51 became the series&#x27; spec chassis thereafter.

In 2006, Formula Nippon underwent a drastic revision of its technical regulations. The new Lola FN06 chassis was introduced, while new three-litre V8 engines by Toyota and Honda were introduced, based on the same engine blocks that the manufacturers used in the 2005 IndyCar Series. American racecar manufacturer Swift Engineering produced the FN09 chassis that was introduced in 2009, and used until 2013. Also, in 2009, a new 3.4 litre V8 engine formula was introduced, a common engine that would be used in Formula Nippon and the GT500 class of Super GT, as well as a &quot;push-to-pass&quot; overtake system that is still used today.

The Dallara SF14 was used between the 2014 to 2018 season, and featured at least 30% components manufactured in Japan. Changed regulations both in Super Formula and Formula 1 resulted in closest gap ever between lap times: in 2014 season in Round 1 at Suzuka Circuit in Q2 André Lotterer did 1:36.996 which was 4.49 seconds slower than Nico Rosberg&#x27;s pole time of 1:32.506 for the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix and was not only inside 107% rule but could potentially placed him 21st in F1 grid in front of two cars of Kamui Kobayashi (1:37.015) and Max Chilton (1:37.481).

In 2016, Yokohama Rubber replaced Bridgestone as the series&#x27; sole tyre supplier.

The Dallara SF19, which was used from the 2019 to 2022 season, was unveiled at Suzuka Circuit in October 2017. It weighed 670 kilograms (including the driver), and was powered by a two-litre single turbo-charged engines built by Honda and Toyota under the Nippon Race Engine (NRE) formula. The engines used in Super Formula have been detuned compared to their counterparts used in Super GT (GT500), but continue to allow for the use of the &quot;push-to-pass&quot; style Overtaking System (OTS) that allows for an additional five kilogrammes per hour (5 kg/h) of fuel burn for up to 200 seconds during a race.

The Dallara SF23, a slightly modified version of the SF19, was unveiled on December 13, 2022, and has been used since the 2023 season. It has upgraded aerodynamics to improve overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing.

==Drivers==
In terms of drivers, Super Formula is a high-level series where the field is composed mainly of professional factory drivers who are paid to race. It is unanimously regarded as the highest level of formula racing in Japan and Asia, and although opinions on its exact global position vary, it is generally considered to be a higher level series than Formula 2, but slightly below IndyCar and to a larger extent Formula One. 

Super Formula is a top-level national series and not a feeder or junior category, as there is no series directly above it and many professional drivers compete in it until they retire. Some drivers, mostly foreign, have used it as a platform to prove their ability in an attempt to move to Formula One or elsewhere. 

The bulk of the grid consists of Japanese drivers, most of whom have the goal of forging successful long-term careers in the series. Foreign drivers have always been regular participants in the series, and there have been several drivers to come from a Japanese Top Formula drive to a prominent Formula One role; the best-known of these include Michael Schumacher, Eddie Irvine, Ralf Schumacher, Pedro de la Rosa, Stoffel Vandoorne, Pierre Gasly, and Liam Lawson.

Conversely, several foreign drivers have built long careers in Japan; examples of such drivers include André Lotterer, Benoît Tréluyer, Loïc Duval, and João Paulo de Oliveira. Most drivers in the series are contracted to either Honda or Toyota – the series&#x27; two engine manufacturers since 2006 – for whom they also typically compete in the Super GT sports car series, Japan&#x27;s other top motorsport category.

===Feeder series===
The primary feeder series for Super Formula is Super Formula Lights, which was known as the Japanese Formula 3 Championship prior to 2020. The Formula Regional Japanese Championship and F4 Japanese Championship sit below Super Formula Lights in the Japanese single-seater pyramid. 

Honda Performance Development (now Honda Racing Corporation US) offered a US$600,000 annual scholarship to the winner of the Formula Regional Americas Championship towards a Honda-powered seat in Super Formula beginning in 2021. 2022 series champion Raoul Hyman was the only driver to accept the scholarship before it was discontinued.

== Circuits ==
Super Formula races are traditionally held at the six major national racing circuits in Japan. Suzuka Circuit, the traditional home of the Formula One Japanese Grand Prix, has staged more rounds than any other venue and has been on the calendar every year since the formation of the series in 1973. Suzuka typically hosts two rounds per season: The Suzuka 2&amp;4 Race, a joint event staged with the All-Japan Road Race Championship, is typically held in the spring. The JAF Suzuka Grand Prix, Japan&#x27;s oldest national formula racing event, is typically held at the end of the season in the autumn.

Fuji Speedway did not host any racing in 2004 while the circuit underwent a wholesale renovation, but otherwise, it has been part of the calendar in almost every Super Formula season including the very first season of the All-Japan F2000 Championship in 2002. Mobility Resort Motegi (known as Twin Ring Motegi until 2022) opened in 1997 and has been part of the calendar every year since. Sportsland Sugo has been on the calendar every year since its current configuration was opened in 1987.

Miné Circuit (formerly Nishinihon Circuit), was a regular fixture of the calendar until it closed for spectator events after the 2005 season. Autopolis, in Kyushu, and Okayama International Circuit, in the Chūgoku region, have since replaced Miné as the westernmost venues that Super Formula visits, though as of 2021 the series no longer races at Okayama. Tokachi International Speedway in Hokkaido briefly hosted the series from 1995 to 1996.

Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia hosted the first and only championship round outside of Japan when it was part of the 2004 calendar. The series planned to race at Inje Speedium in South Korea during the 2013 season and again in 2025, but both events were cancelled.

<doc id="705327" wikidata="Q1809250" url="?curid=705327" title="Mario Paint">
<text>is a 1992 art creation video game developed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 (R&amp;D1) and Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Mario Paint&quot; consists of a raster graphics editor, an animation program, a music composer, and a point and click minigame, all of which are designed to be used with the Super NES Mouse peripheral, which the game was packaged and sold with. Per its name, the game is &quot;Mario&quot;-themed, and features sprites and sound effects that are taken from or in the vein of &quot;Super Mario World&quot;.

&quot;Mario Paint&quot; sold very well following its release and is one of the best-selling SNES games, with over 2.3 million copies sold. The game was released to fairly positive contemporaneous reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, features, innovative design, and educational potential, but criticized unnecessary limitations on creation that rendered it unviable for serious creation. Retrospective reviews have been more positive, praising the game as &quot;memorable&quot;, &quot;addictive&quot;, &quot;unique&quot;, and &quot;ingenious&quot;, and it has been deemed one of the best SNES games of all time. &quot;Mario Paint&quot;&#x27;s music composer in particular has been used to create original songs, covers, and remixes using the game&#x27;s sounds and limitations.

A 1998 successor game, &quot;Mario no Photopi&quot; for the Nintendo 64, was never released outside of Japan. This was followed by a series, &quot;Mario Artist&quot;, released for the 64DD peripheral starting in 1999; however, only four titles were released in Japan only before the rest were canceled by 2000. Similar titles and game creation systems released by Nintendo since, such as &quot;WarioWare D.I.Y.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot;, include features from and references to &quot;Mario Paint&quot;; &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; in particular was originally envisioned as a &quot;Mario Paint&quot; title for the Wii U.

== Gameplay ==
According to the manual, two parts of &quot;Mario Paint&quot; are meant to familiarize the user with the SNES Mouse: the title screen, where users can click on each letter in the logo and each element on the screen to prompt a respective Easter egg; and a fly-swatting minigame, &quot;Gnat Attack&quot;, where the player must swat 100 insects before fighting a boss named King Watinga. The minigame has three levels, and after they are completed, the game starts over with the enemies swarming in and attacking at faster speed. Content creation features of the program include a drawing board, a coloring book, an animation tool (called &quot;Animation Land&quot;), and a music composer. Collages can be saved at a time in the program to be loaded at later usage of the software or recorded to VCR. In the coloring book, the user can color-in and edit four pre-made black-and-white drawings, including one featuring Yoshi and Mario, another featuring various animals, a greeting card, and an underwater scene.

The drawing board is where original paintings can be created. A user can choose from 15 colors and 75 patterns. After choosing, the user can draw with a pen (small, medium, or large) and airbrush; fill in a closed area the selected texture with the &quot;paint brush&quot; tool; and create perfectly straight lines, rectangles, and circles that is the color or pattern selected (either fully colored-in, with just an outline, or with a spray-canned outline). Parts of a drawing can be copied, pasted, and moved to other areas, rotated vertically and horizontally, or erased via pens of six various sizes. An entire painting can also be erased via nine unique visual effects. Animation Land involves the use of the drawing board&#x27;s tools for creating four, six, and/or nine-frame animations. Elements of one frame can be copied to others for smooth animations to be created. If a character is being animated, the animation box can be set on a background and move throughout it in a &quot;path&quot; recorded by using the mouse in the &quot;path lever&quot; feature.

In the animation and drawing features, stamps can be added to each painting and frame, with 120 existing stamps included in the software. There is a stamp editor that allows the user to create new stamps or edit existing ones via a large tile grid, with the same 15 colors from the drawing board usable in the stamp editor. Up to 15 user-made stamps can be saved to a &quot;personal stamp database&quot;. There are also text stamps, such as English, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji characters, that can be added and changed in size and color.

The music composer allows users to write pieces either in common time or triple time. There are 15 instruments samples to use that are notated with different icons, including eight melodic sounds (a piano represented by Mario&#x27;s head, a bell sound represented by a Power Star, a trumpet represented by a Fire Flower, a pulse wave represented by the Game Boy, a horn section sample represented by a goose, a guitar sound represented by an airliner, and an organ represented by a car), three percussion sounds (a bass drum represented by a Super Mushroom, a woodblock represented by a ship, and a bass pluck represented by a heart), and five sound effects (Yoshi&#x27;s zip, a dog bark, a cat meow, a pig oink, and a baby hiccup). The icons are added to a treble clef. Notes that can be added are limited to a range from the B below middle C to high G. Since no flats or sharps can be added, pieces are restricted to notes of the C major/A minor scale. Other limitations include composing only in quarter notes, a maximum number of three notes on a beat, and a maximum number of measures a song can last (24 bars for songs, and 32 bars for songs). Pieces made in the composition tool can be played in the animation and coloring book modes.

==Reception==
=== Contemporaneous ===

The &quot;Mario Paint&quot; and Mouse package sold more than units by March 1993. &quot;Mario Paint&quot; is one of the best-selling SNES games at over 2.3 million copies sold worldwide.

&quot;Mario Paint&quot;″s possible age appeal and amount of features were discussed in reviews. While &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; suggested that it had enough features and interactive elements to fascinate a person of any age with &quot;even a remote interest&quot; in artistic ventures, other reviews, even from critics who enjoyed the program, suggested the program&#x27;s limitations made its novelty wear thin to those past its young target demographic and made its high price tag unjustifiable. &quot;Total!&quot;″s Steve Misery argued that the limitations were inexcusable for a title on a console that can have 250 colors on a screen at a time, stereo audio, and instantly changing graphics. Additionally, he noted the program &quot;goes completely overboard in one area, and then misses others out completely&quot;, such as the lack of a zoom feature despite there being multiple flashy ways to erase a painting.

Criticisms of the program brought up in reviews include long save times, &quot;impossible&quot; fine detailing, and the fact that only one collage can be saved at a time.

&quot;Mario Paint&quot; was honored by the Parents&#x27; Choice Award, a non-profit organization recognizing children&#x27;s educational entertainment. The game also received a platinum award at the 1994 Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Awards. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; rated &quot;Mario Paint&quot; the fourth best SNES game of 1992.

=== Retrospective ===

Calling &quot;Mario Paint&quot; &quot;perhaps the most ingenious and inspired idea Nintendo ever came up with for a product&quot;, &quot;AllGame&quot; rated it 5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Honest Gamers&quot; stated, &quot;It has very little flaws, if any, is very addictive, and even a child can use it. The games never get old and none of it ever gets tedious. It is one of the best games for the SNES.&quot; &quot;US Gamer&quot; called &quot;Mario Paint&quot; &quot;an era-appropriate solution to graphics programs on expensive PCs&quot; which is &quot;at least somewhat responsible for our modern era of 2D indie throwback games&quot;. It said, &quot;Every single element ... is engineered to make the act of creation fun in and of itself, even if you&#x27;re just aimlessly doodling.&quot; Josh Despain of &quot;Defunct Games&quot;, however, opined that while it was a &quot;bold and unconventional move&quot; for Nintendo to release a &quot;Mario&quot; product that was not a game, thus being a &quot;unique piece of video game history&quot;, it was nothing more than another simple paint program with a Mario theme.

In 2006, it was rated the 162nd best game made on a Nintendo system in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 Games list. In 2014, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it as the 105th best Nintendo game in its list of &quot;The Top 125 Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Peer Schneider cited the game&#x27;s &quot;smart and playful interface&quot; as a &quot;game changer&quot; and commented that &quot;It effectively erased the barriers between creating and playing, making it one of the most memorable and unique games to ever be released on a console.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; listed Mario Paint 35th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot; In 2022, &quot;IGN&quot; rated &quot;Mario Paint&quot; 22nd on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot;, noting that the game inspired different variations of popular songs.

===Legacy===
====In video games====
Several video game developers have cited &quot;Mario Paint&quot; as an inspiration. Hirokazu Tanaka, a member of &quot;Mario Paint&quot;&#x27;s sound staff, later worked on &quot;EarthBound&quot; (1994), where some of &quot;Mario Paint&quot;″s sound effects and instrument patches appear. Hirofumi Matsuoka, who directed the development of &quot;Mario Paint&quot;, later worked on several &quot;Mario Artist&quot; entries and many of the &quot;Wario&quot; titles, including &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot; (2003) for the Game Boy Advance, the microgames from which originated from minigames present in &quot;Mario Artist: Polygon Studio&quot;, which themselves were conceptualized by Kouichi Kawamoto. Masahito Hatakeyama, one of the designers of &quot;WarioWare D.I.Y.&quot; (2009) for the Nintendo DS, cited &quot;Mario Paint&quot;″s drawing board and music composer as the inspiration for &quot;D.I.Y.&quot;&#x27;s drawing and music creation tools, and several development team members cited it as an early inspiration for their video game development careers.

Further references to &quot;Mario Paint&quot; appear elsewhere in the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series. &quot;WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!&quot; includes Gnat Attack as a microgame. &quot;&quot; (2004) for the Nintendo DS includes both a microgame set in &quot;Mario Paint&quot;&#x27;s drawing board and a feature called &quot;Wario Paint&quot;, which has players color in outlines of &quot;WarioWare&quot; series characters in a manner similar to &quot;Mario Paint&quot;&#x27;s coloring book. &quot;WarioWare D.I.Y.&quot; includes several easter eggs and callbacks to &quot;Mario Paint&quot;, including microgames based on the drawing board and Gnat Attack. &quot;WarioWare Gold&quot; (2018) for the Nintendo 3DS also includes Gnat Attack as a returning microgame. Sound effects from &quot;Mario Paint&quot; also appear throughout the series.

The Wii Photo Channel features editing functionality similar to &quot;Mario Paint&quot;, and includes several of the special erasers.

&quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; (2015), a level creation suite, was originally envisioned as a &quot;Mario Paint&quot; title for the Wii U. Takashi Tezuka, the game&#x27;s producer, stated that he &quot;was inspired to bring the fun of &quot;Mario Paint&quot; into this course editor to make something fun and creative for people to enjoy&quot;. &quot;US Gamer&quot; called &quot;Mario Paint&quot; an essential part of &quot;the road to &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;&quot;. As a callback to &quot;Mario Paint&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; includes interactive title screen easter eggs, the return of the Gnat Attack minigame, and the appearance of elements and characters originally from &quot;Mario Paint&quot;, including Undodog, a tan dog functioning as the undo button in both games. Its sequel, &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot; (2019) for the Nintendo Switch, also features references to &quot;Mario Paint&quot;, including the return of Undodog as a prominent non-player character in the game&#x27;s story mode.

&quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; (2017) for the Nintendo Switch includes three costumes for Mario—a black tuxedo, an artists&#x27; paint-covered apron, and a classical conductor outfit—that are directly based on artworks created for &quot;Mario Paint&quot;&#x27;s promotional materials, with the apron&#x27;s paired beret also referencing &quot;Mario Artist&quot;.

A remixed &quot;Mario Paint&quot; soundtrack medley can be played as background music in the Miiverse stage in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; (2014). &quot;Mario Paint&quot; is also represented in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018) for the Nintendo Switch through an Assist Trophy called &quot;Flies &amp; Hand&quot;, where the flyswatter from Gnat Attack attempts to hit both insects and opposing players.

====In animation====
The first episode of &quot;Homestar Runner&quot; in 1996 was animated using &quot;Mario Paint&quot;. A primitive introduction video made with &quot;Mario Paint&quot; can be found in the museum section of the site. A later short in the series, &quot;Strong Bad is a Bad Guy&quot;, was made using &quot;Mario Paint&quot;.

==== In music ====
Since the early 2010s, there has been an online culture of users on forums, Discord, and YouTube creating original songs and covers with &quot;Mario Paint&quot;″s music composer and programs replicating it, including &quot;Mario Paint Composer&quot;, &quot;Advanced Mario Sequencer&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Paint&quot;. &quot;Mario Paint&quot; covers that have garnered coverage from the press include jeonghoon95&#x27;s rendition of Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Get Lucky&quot;, a cover of Nicholas Britell&#x27;s theme for the HBO series &quot;Succession&quot;, and axelrod777&#x27;s cover of the Bob-omb Battlefield level music from 1996&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;.

==Successors==
A downloadable version was released in Japan via the Satellaview broadcast service in 1997. Titled , this version was modified to use a standard controller without the need of a mouse.

A sequel to &quot;Mario Paint&quot; was titled &quot;Mario Paint 64&quot; in development, and then released in 1999 as the Japan-exclusive launch game &quot;Mario Artist&quot; for the 64DD. Nintendo had commissioned the joint developer Software Creations, who described the game&#x27;s original 1995 design idea as &quot;a sequel to &quot;Mario Paint&quot; in 3D for the N64&quot;. &quot;Paint Studio&quot; has been described by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; as being &quot;Mario Paint&quot; &quot;direct follow-up&quot; and &quot;spiritual successor&quot; respectively. Likewise bundled with its system&#x27;s mouse, &quot;Paint Studio&quot; includes many features from &quot;Mario Paint&quot;, including new additions such as a gallery and 3D explorable spaces that can be drawn on. Gnat Attack was also intended to appear in &quot;Paint Studio&quot;, but it was cut before the final release, though it was shown on several magazine previews and some reviewers received copies including it.

<text>The Mesaoria (, ) is a broad, sweeping plain which makes up the north centre of the island of Cyprus.

==Geography==
The Mesaoria is the name given to the broad tract of plain which extends across the island from the Bay of Famagusta in the east to that of Morphou in the west, which is a length of 96 km, with a breadth varying from 16 to 32 km.

The streams which traverse it are mere winter torrents, which descend from the southern chain but scarcely reach the sea. The Pedias (Pediaeus) and lalias (Yialias, Idalias) lose most of their flood
waters in the marshes about Salamis, near the Bay of Famagusta. The Pedias rises near
Machaira and passes close to Nicosia, indeed flowed through it before the river was diverted by the Venetians. The lalias rises very near the source of the Pedias, passes through Nisou, Dali (the ancient Idalion) and Pyroi, and traverses the Mesaoria in a direction more or less parallel with the Pedias. A smaller but more constant streams is the Cares (Clarios), which flows from the slopes of Troodos
into the Bay of Morphou.

The Mesaoria plain is bounded on the east and west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Troodos mountains and on the north by the Kyrenia mountains (Pentadaktylos). It has an area of approximately 1000 km2 (390 mi2). It rises to an altitude of 325 m (1066 ft), with an average elevation of perhaps 100 m (330 ft). There are a number of rivers and other water courses crossing this plain, but none of them have water year round.

The Alluvial Plains of the centre of the island are for the most part the product of successive rain-storms and floods which have brought down from the mountains immense quantities of light debris which has been spread over the lower lands, principally by human agency exerted in the system of &quot;colmatage&quot;, which has been practised from time immemorial. This has resulted in the general raising of the land surface and incidentally in the natural reclamation of many acres of land in the lower parts of the Mesaoria, which once were arms of the sea.

The word &quot;Mesaoria&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Mesarya&quot;), means &quot;between the mountains&quot; in Greek. For the most part, the Mesaoria is a flat, bare plain, with few trees except for those planted as windbreaks. It is the agricultural heartland of Cyprus, but it depends completely on winter rainfall and irrigation for its water, which limits production. It is also the most settled region on the island, containing dozens of villages and many of the largest towns, including the capital, Nicosia.

Due to deforestation, much of the Mesaoria is covered with &quot;Kafkalla&quot;, which is a local term referring to calcium carbonate that has been compacted into a hardpan. The only plants that grow well on this surface are quickly eaten by grazing animals, which has greatly exacerbated soil erosion.

The plain which has a subtropical semi-arid climate, can be uncomfortably hot in the summer, with temperatures of 40 °C being common. The rainfall on the plain is significantly lower than in the mountains, but in recent years a number of dams and irrigation systems have been constructed to capture the mountain runoff.

==History==
Twenty million years ago Cyprus was actually two islands, which were the predecessors of the Kyrenia and Troodos mountain ranges. Approximately one million years ago, the Mesaoria plain arose, resulting in the current island of Cyprus. At various times, changing levels of the Mediterranean sea covered and exposed the plain; it has been in its present form since the end of the Pleistocene.

The Mesaoria plain shows evidence of cultivation dating from the neolithic. In classical times the entire center of the island was covered by dense forests. Most of these were cut down in the middle of the 1st century BC to provide wood for the Ptolemaic navy. Additionally, much wood was harvested to provide energy for the extraction of copper. However, as recently as the late sixteenth century there were still significant stands of trees on the plain. Today, the only remaining forested areas are on the surrounding mountains, particularly the Troodos range.

As evidenced by a papal document in 1196, the eastern region of Mesaoria had become settled with a dense network of villages by the 12th century. The plain served as the island&#x27;s prime agricultural region.

A single line of railway of 2 ft 6in gauge was constructed the full length of the plain, from Famagusta to Nicosia (36 miles) and then to Karavostasi, on the Bay of Morphou (a further 34 miles). Work was begun in 1904 and Nicosia the capital was connected on 21 October 1905. The line was closed in 1951.

<text>Stutfield Peak is a mountain in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada. It is located at the northern end of the Columbia Icefield, north-west from Mount Kitchener, in the Winston Churchill Range of the Canadian Rockies. The peak has two summits - Stutfield East and Stutfield West - and is therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;The Stutfields&quot;. The West peak is higher than the East peak by .

In 1899, mountaineer J. Norman Collie named the mountain after Hugh Stutfield, who climbed with Collie during his exploration of the Canadian Rockies.

&quot;Stufield Glacier&quot; was also named after Hugh Stutfield, and flows southeast from the peak, in the Columbia Icefield.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, it is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below with wind chill factors below .

<text>Eucalyptus delegatensis, commonly known as alpine ash, gum-topped stringybark, white-top and in Victoria as woollybutt, is a species of tree that is endemic to southeastern Australia. It has a straight trunk with rough, fibrous to stringy bark on the lower half of the trunk, smooth white bark above, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and barrel-shaped or hemispherical fruit.

==Description==
&quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot; is a tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes to , and forms a lignotuber. The bark is rough, grey to black, fibrous or stringy on the lower half of the trunk, smooth white to greyish above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same glossy green to bluish green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and fifteen in leaf s on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, green to yellow or red, long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum with a small point on the tip. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed in the fruit.

==Taxonomy and naming==
&quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot; was first formally described in 1900 by Richard Thomas Baker from a specimen collected by William Baeuerlen, (previously known as Wilhelm Bäuerlen) on &quot;Delegate Mountain&quot;. The description was published in &quot;Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales&quot;. The specific epithet (&quot;delegatensis&quot;) refers to the type location.

In 1985 Douglas John Boland described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census:
* &quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot; subsp. &quot;delegatensis&quot; that has broadly lance-shaped juvenile leaves and is found in New South Wales and Victoria;
* &quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot; subsp. &quot;tasmaniensis&quot; that has more or less round juvenile leaves with a short &quot;drip-tip&quot; and only grows in Tasmania.

==Distribution and habitat==
Alpine ash is widespread and often dominant in grassy or wet subalpine forest, in deep fertile soil, often on slopes, and commonly forms pure stands. In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory it is found south from the Brindabella Range and in Victoria it occurs at altitudes between east of Mount Macedon. Subspecies &quot;tasmaniensis&quot; is endemic to Tasmania.

<text>David Lubega Balemezi (born 13 April 1975), better known by his stage name Lou Bega, is a German singer. His 1999 song &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot;, a remake of Pérez Prado&#x27;s 1949 instrumental piece, reached no. 1 in many European countries and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Bega added words to the song and sampled the original version extensively. Bega&#x27;s signature musical sounds consist of combining musical elements of the 1940s and 1950s with modern beats and grooves.

==Personal life==

David Lubega Balemezi was born on 13 April 1975 in Munich, Bavaria, then West Germany, to an Italian mother, who came from Sicily, and a Ugandan father. His father Charles went to West Germany in 1972 to study biology at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Until age six, Bega spent most of his time with his mother Nicole in Italy, then they lived permanently in Munich, where Bega attended German primary school. As a teenager, he traveled to Miami, Florida, where he found the inspiration for his hit single &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot;. Bega also lived in Uganda for six months.

During interviews with him that TV 2 Denmark did in 2019 for their documentary series &quot;Guds bedste børn&quot;, he stated that he was in a hotel room on the Maldives during a storm when he checked out the room&#x27;s Bible and was captivated by it. Upon returning home to Germany, he felt the waiting times to be baptized were long, and contacted the Danish movement &quot;The Last Reformation&quot; after seeing their videos on YouTube, where he was baptized. Parts of the conversion process and later missionary work were brought up in the movie &quot;The Last Reformation: The Life&quot;, which was commissioned by &quot;The Last Reformation&quot; themselves.

==Career==

Bega started his musical career as a rapper. At the age of 13, he founded a hip hop group with two other boys. It would be two years before Bega and his friends&#x27; first CD would be released in 1990. While living in Miami, he discovered Latin music. After returning to Munich, Bega met his then manager, Goar Biesenkamp, as well as music producers &quot;Frank Lio&quot; (Achim Kleist) and &quot;Donald Fact&quot; (Wolfgang von Webenau) (Syndicate Musicproduction), with whom he developed the concept for the song &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot;. Bega signed a recording contract to the label Lautstark.

His first single &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; became a world wide hit in 1999, charting at No. 1 in most European countries, including Germany, UK, France, and No. 3 in the United States. In France, &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; spent twenty weeks at No. 1. It was also used by the British television broadcaster Channel 4 for their coverage of test match cricket between 1999 and 2005.

On 19 July 1999, Bega released his debut album &quot;A Little Bit of Mambo&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 both in Germany and the U.S. While it charted moderately in the UK, peaking at only No. 50, it reached No. 1 in Austria, Canada, Finland, Hungary, and Switzerland. The second single, &quot;I Got a Girl&quot; charted well, entering the Top 10 in some European countries, including France, Finland and Belgium. The third single, &quot;Tricky, Tricky&quot;, achieved No. 18 on the Canadian charts and No. 74 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In France, Bega did well also with his single &quot;Mambo Mambo&quot;, which reached No. 11 on the French charts.

Bega&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; was released on 28 May 2001. The album failed to experience success similar to its predecessor in Bega&#x27;s native market or internationally. It peaked at No. 54 in Germany, and No. 23 on Switzerland&#x27;s album chart. The album produced two singles, &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; and &quot;Gentleman&quot;, both of which charted moderately.

In 2002, the artist published a compilation titled &quot;King of Mambo&quot; and two years later another compilation, &quot;The best of Lou Bega&quot;, with which he regained some of the prominence.

Bega released his third studio album &quot;Lounatic&quot; on 10 May 2005, which failed to enter the charts.

On 21 May 2010, Bega released his fourth album titled &quot;Free Again&quot;, which also did not find much success on the charts. It only charted in Switzerland peaking at No. 78.

Bega&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;A Little Bit of 80&#x27;s&quot; was released on 28 June 2013, in Germany on Ariola (Sony Music). In this album, Bega again covered classic international hits including &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; (1984)&quot; by Sade, &quot;I&#x27;m So Excited&quot; (1982) by The Pointer Sisters, &quot;Vamos a la playa&quot; (1983) by Righeira, &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; (1968) by Neil Diamond (a remake of which was a hit for UB40 during the 1980s) and &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; (1983) by Culture Club. Bega&#x27;s first single off his fifth album was his cover of the 1982 hit &quot;Give It Up&quot; by KC and the Sunshine Band, which was released in Germany on 14 June 2013. The song peaked at No. 6 in Germany.

In 2019, Bega released &quot;Scatman &amp; Hatman&quot;, his first release since 2013. The track uses vocal samples from the 1994 single &quot;Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)&quot; by Scatman John. Shortly after the track&#x27;s release, he told Jason Lipshutz of &quot;Billboard&quot; that he was inspired to create the track by the fact that Scatman John died in the same year that &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; was released, adding,

==Collaborations==

In 2006, Bega recorded a song titled &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot; with Edvin Marton and a music video was also filmed. The song has only appeared on Marton&#x27;s album &quot;Stradivarius&quot; as a bonus track and was never featured on any of Bega&#x27;s albums.

==Live performances==

Bega has appeared on stage for royals as well as international corporations. Bega was on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;MAD TV&quot;, &quot;The Martin Short Show&quot;, &quot;Motown Live&quot;, &quot;Jenny Jones&quot;, &quot;Queen Latifah&quot;, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, and others. Bega was also the only artist to be asked to sing the same song twice on Germany&#x27;s headlining show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007, he performed in Poland. He has been the MC at the American Music Awards, the Grammy Awards, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Radio Awards and at the Love Parade in Berlin. He also performed live on television on the &quot;Ant and Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2015.
In July 2016, Bega performed as a special guest in several of André Rieu&#x27;s famous Maastricht concerts. In December 2021, he performed &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; at a Polish military base during a show for the support of Polish troops deployed against refugees at the Polish-Belarusian border, thanking them for &quot;defending our border&quot;.

==Appearances in other media==

Bega sang the theme song for the Disney Channel animated series &quot;Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers&quot;. Bega also recorded and starred in a music video of a Disney version of &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; that featured Disney-themed lyrics.

In the video game &quot;Tropico&quot;, Bega is one of the characters that the player can choose as their dictatorial persona. He was included as part of a licensing deal that also saw Bega&#x27;s song &quot;Club Elitaire&quot; integrated into the German release of &quot;Tropico&quot;.
In the Ubisoft/Disney Interactive video game &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s The Jungle Book Rhythm n&#x27; Groove&quot;, Bega participates in a challenge with his namesake. The player dances as King Louie, attempting to dance to Bega&#x27;s rendition of &quot;I Wanna Be Like You&quot;. Doing so will unlock a video of him with children dancing to the aforementioned song. Bega also wrote the theme song for the French cartoon series &quot;Marsupilami&quot;.

<text>Barry Adrian Reese (born July 7, 1982), better known by his stage name Cassidy, is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He first garnered attention for his freestyles and competitions as a battle rapper in the late 1990s, and formed the Philadelphia-based hip hop collective Larsiny Family by the end of the decade. American record producer Swizz Beatz discovered the group in 2000 and signed Cassidy to his newly-established Full Surface Records, in a joint venture with J Records. He adopted a commercially-oriented approach for his 2003 debut single &quot;Hotel&quot; (featuring R. Kelly) and its follow-up, &quot;Get No Better&quot; (featuring Mashonda); the former peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 while both preceded the release of his debut studio album, &quot;Split Personality&quot; (2004). 

The album peaked at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while his second album, &quot;I&#x27;m a Hustla&quot; (2005), peaked at number five and was supported by the lead single of the same name—which received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Following an eight-month incarceration and preceding legal battle, his third album, &quot;B.A.R.S. The Barry Adrian Reese Story&quot; (2007), was met with critical acclaim and peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, also spawning the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top-40 single &quot;My Drink n My 2 Step&quot; (featuring Swizz Beatz). It served as his final release on a major label, and he signed with Carmelo Anthony&#x27;s Kross Over Entertainment to independently release his fourth album, &quot;C.A.S.H.&quot; (2010), which narrowly entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. He has since released three independent albums under his imprint, Mayhem Music.

==Musical career==
===2000–05: &quot;Split Personality&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Hustla&quot;===

In 2000, Cassidy was a member of the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based rap group Larsiny. Larsiny was discovered in Philadelphia by record producer Swizz Beatz&#x27;s father Terrence Dean, and in turn, the group signed to the Ruff Ryders-subsidiary label TD Entertainment. Their breakout appearance was the song &quot;Ryde Or Die Boyz&quot; from the July 2000 album &quot;Ryde or Die Vol. 2&quot;. Cassidy co-wrote the single &quot;Got It All&quot; for fellow Philadelphia rapper Eve, which was also from the album.

In 2002, Cassidy signed a recording contract with Swizz Beatz&#x27;s Full Surface imprint, under the aegis of Ruff Ryders Entertainment and J Records. On November 29, 2003, he released his commercial debut single, &quot;Hotel&quot;, featuring R. Kelly. The song reached the Top 10 of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The second single, &quot;Get No Better&quot;, features Mashonda. On March 16, 2004, Cassidy released his debut album, &quot;Split Personality&quot;. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the following month.

On April 15, 2005, Cassidy released the single &quot;I&#x27;m a Hustla&quot;. The next single, &quot;B-Boy Stance&quot;, features vocals and production from his mentor, Swizz Beatz. On June 28, 2005, Cassidy released his second studio album, &quot;I&#x27;m a Hustla&quot;. It debuted at number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with 93,000 copies sold in the first week.

===2006–11: &quot;B.A.R.S.&quot; and &quot;C.A.S.H.&quot;===
In 2006, after his release from prison and recovering from an auto wreck, Cassidy began work on his third studio album, &quot;B.A.R.S. The Barry Adrian Reese Story&quot;. The album was released on November 6, 2007, debuting at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 63,000 copies sold in the first week. The album was led by the single &quot;My Drink n My 2 Step&quot;, featuring vocals and production from Swizz Beatz.

In late 2009, Cassidy signed with Carmelo Anthony&#x27;s label Kross Over Entertainment. While preparing his fourth studio album, he released a mixtape series entitled &quot;Apply Pressure&quot;. On August 24, 2010, Cassidy released the five-track EP &quot;Face 2 Face&quot;, with the promotional single &quot;Face 2 Face&quot;. On November 16, 2010, Cassidy&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;C.A.S.H. (Cass a Straight Hustla)&quot; was released. On its first week it had sold about 5,200 copies, much lower than his previous studio albums. &quot;Drumma Bass&quot; was the only official single from the album.

===2012–present: &quot;Mr. Hip-Hop&quot; and &quot;Da Science&quot;===
On May 21, 2012, Cassidy hosted a release party for his mixtape &quot;Mayhem Music&quot;. On July 8, 2012, he released the mixtape &quot;Mayhem Music: AP3&quot;. After fellow Philly rapper Meek Mill said he would battle Cassidy, which Cassidy later said he would accept if the money was right. They participated in a &quot;twitter beef&quot; after which Cassidy released &quot;The Diary of a Hustla&quot; which was originally thought to be a diss towards Meek. This was later refuted by Cassidy. They both were asking for $100,000 each for the battle to take place. However, after Meek Mill dissed Cassidy&#x27;s song &quot;Condom Style&quot; (a remake of Psy&#x27;s &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;) Cassidy released a song titled &quot;Me, Myself &amp; iPhone&quot; where he took shots at Meek Mill. Afterwards, Meek Mill responded with the diss track &quot;Repo&quot; which Mill later said would be the final diss record he would release against Cassidy. Cassidy later said the feud was not personal, saying it was all in the spirit of hip hop. On January 6, 2013, Cassidy released a 10-minute-long diss response titled &quot;Raid&quot;. On October 6, Cassidy released his album Da Science.

==Other ventures==
In 2007, Cassidy signed a deal as the &quot;new face&quot; for Lot 29&#x27;s fall clothing line. In 2009, Cassidy appeared in the comedy film, &quot;Next Day Air&quot;.

In late 2012, Cassidy remade South Korean singer Psy&#x27;s international hit single &quot;Gangnam Style, re-titling it &quot;Condom Style&quot;. The remake reportedly earned Cassidy an endorsement deal with Trojan.

In 2013, Cassidy released a biography titled &quot;Behind B.A.R.S: The Authorized Biography of Cassidy&quot;.

In late 2014, Cassidy returned to battle rap by battling Los Angeles–based veteran Dizaster, on December 6, 2014, at Filmon.com&#x27;s &quot;Ether&quot; event.

==Personal life==
===Murder case===
On April 15, 2005, three men, including AR-Ab and Cassidy, armed with pistols and an AK-47 assault rifle, fired on three unarmed men during an argument that occurred in the West Oak Lane neighborhood in Northwest Philadelphia. Desmond Hawkins was killed by a shot in the back. Hawkins&#x27; two other friends were treated at hospitals for gunshot wounds and released.

On June 9, a warrant was issued for Cassidy&#x27;s arrest on charges of murder, attempted murder, reckless endangerment, aggravated assault, conspiracy and weapons possession. Cassidy surrendered to Philadelphia police on the afternoon of June 17. At his arraignment on Saturday, June 18, he was denied bail, and sent to Philadelphia&#x27;s Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, a high-security prison, where he would serve his time during the trial and after he was sentenced.

Cassidy&#x27;s murder case took a turn when the primary witness withdrew his confession. This resulted in the judge stating that Cassidy would stand trial for third-degree murder. On August 16, 2005, Municipal Judge Marsha Neifield ruled that prosecutors had sufficient evidence to charge Cassidy with third-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses. This was later overturned to the original, first degree charge - negating the possibility of parole. On January 25, 2006, Cassidy was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime for his involvement in the shooting. He was sentenced to 11 to 23 months in prison plus probation and was credited with the 7 months he had already served.

Cassidy was released from Pennsylvania&#x27;s Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility on March 2, 2006, after serving eight months.

Cassidy talks about his arrest and time in prison in the 2011 film &quot;Rhyme and Punishment&quot;, which documents various hip-hop artists who have done county jail or state/federal prison time.

===Car wreck===
Cassidy was seriously injured in a vehicle wreck on the night of October 5, 2006, when a commercial truck collided with his SUV, in which he was a passenger. He was taken to the Jersey City Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with a fractured skull and several broken bones on the left side of his face. He still has visible scars from the wreck.

<doc id="705385" wikidata="Q263831" url="?curid=705385" title="Tom Schieffer">
<text>John Thomas Schieffer (born October 4, 1947) is an American diplomat and entrepreneur who served as U.S. Ambassador to Australia from 2001 to 2005 and as U.S. Ambassador to Japan from 2005 to 2009.

Schieffer is the founder and President of Envoy International, a consulting firm that provides a wide range of services to clients with international interest. Schieffer is also a keynote speaker on international issues, trade, the global economy, leadership, and organizational management.

Schieffer is a friend and former business partner of President George W. Bush. He is the younger brother of Bob Schieffer, a former CBS News reporter and host of &quot;Face the Nation&quot;. Schieffer and his wife, Susanne, reside in Fort Worth, Texas.

==Early life and education==
John Thomas (Tom) Schieffer was born in Fort Worth, the youngest child of the late John E. Schieffer and the former Gladys Payne, both originally from Austin. His father was the managing partner of a construction company. His mother stayed home to rear the children.

In addition to his brother, Bob, Schieffer has a sister, Sharon Schieffer Mayes, who became a high school principal at Keller High School at a time when only two percent of the principals in Texas&#x27; largest high schools were women. She also had a successful career as an administrator in the Keller Independent School District.

Schieffer grew up in Fort Worth attending public schools and graduated from Arlington Heights High School in 1966. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, receiving a B.A. degree in 1970 in government and earned a master&#x27;s degree in international relations in 1972. His master&#x27;s thesis was entitled, &quot;An Examination of the Nuclear Weapons Debate in India&quot;. The thesis correctly predicted that India would explode a nuclear device in 1974 and pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons as the result of the security threat presented by China.

==Early political career==
While in college, Schieffer worked in the offices of State Senator Don Kennard and Governor John Connally.

Schieffer ran in the 1972 Democratic primary against incumbent Speaker Pro-Tem Tommy Shannon, who was involved in the statewide Sharpstown scandal. After leading the primary and winning the run-off, Schieffer was nominated by Democrats to run at age 24. He won the general election that fall, winning county wide with more than 60% of the vote while Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern received just over 30% in the state. Sworn in at age 25, Schieffer was one of the youngest members of the class of 1972.

The first piece of legislation Schieffer passed was a bill renaming the State Finance Building the Lyndon B. Johnson State Office Building. Johnson, whom Schieffer admired greatly for passing the landmark civil rights bills of 1964, 1965 and 1968, had died in January 1973. During his first session, Schieffer successfully argued for funding the Fort Worth State School - a mental health facility - receiving the editorial kudos of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; for having &quot;earned his spurs&quot; as an effective legislator in Austin.

Re-elected with over 60% of the vote in the 1974 general election (he had no opposition in the Democratic primary), Schieffer was named Chairman of the Local and Consent Calendars Committee in his second term, a position he retained in his third term as well. Schieffer was the lead author on the bill that established the first Presidential primary in Texas. He was also the lead author on the bill that restricted the catch of redfish along the Texas coast, a measure that conservationists and wildlife enthusiasts had sought for years. Schieffer also co-authored legislation that closed a loophole on child care facilities that wanted to operate without meeting state standards.

The first two terms Schieffer was in the legislature, Tarrant County state representatives were elected countywide. After the Legislature passed a single member district plan, he was elected to a third term from a single member district. In January 1978, a federal court overturned the existing single member district plan and redrew the lines. Schieffer, who retained only one precinct out of his old district, carried every precinct in the Democratic primary but narrowly lost his seat to Republican Bob Ware in the general election.

Schieffer remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting candidates like Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., Governor Mark White, and Congressman Pete Geren.

==Legal career==
After losing his legislative seat, Schieffer returned to course work at The University of Texas law school. At the time, Texas law allowed legislators who had served three terms to take the State Bar exam a year early if they had taken two years of course work at an accredited law school. Schieffer completed his two years and passed the state bar exam. He was admitted to the practice of law on October 31, 1979, and became a corporate lawyer in Fort Worth, specializing in the oil and gas industry.

==Civic and board experiences==
In civic matters, Schieffer was appointed a Trustee of the Tarrant County Junior College (now Tarrant County College) and was elected to a full term without opposition. Schieffer served as a board member of the Texas Commerce Bank in Fort Worth and as an advisory board member to the bank when it was later acquired by JPMorgan Chase.

In addition, Schieffer served on the board of Drew Industries, a New York Stock Exchange-listed company. Always interested in educational issues, Schieffer has served on the boards of the Winston School in Dallas, the Tarrant County Community College Foundation, the Dallas County Community College Foundation, and the Penrose Foundation, which provides college scholarships for Hispanic students. Schieffer also served on the Texas Rangers Foundation Board and was active with his wife Susanne in Habitat for Humanity, the Food Bank of Tarrant County, and the Dallas Can Academy.

Schieffer currently serves on a number of national and International Boards. He is a member of the International High Speed Rail Association Board headquartered in Japan; the International Advisory Board of the Mansfield Foundation in Washington; the Council of American Ambassadors Board in Washington; the honorary board of the Japan America Society of Dallas-Fort Worth, and is an honorary counselor of the US-Japan Council. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy in 2016.

==Texas Rangers baseball club==
Schieffer&#x27;s success in his law practice and business career allowed him to join an investment group led by George W. Bush and Edward W. (Rusty) Rose that bought the Texas Rangers baseball club on April 21, 1989. Having begun as only an investor in the group, Bush and Rose asked Schieffer to be the Partner-In-Charge of Ballpark Development in July 1990. Schieffer toured ballparks around America and successfully negotiated a public-private partnership with the City of Arlington, which became a model for cooperation between cities and private entities in development projects. The Rangers and the City of Arlington announced a new stadium deal in October 1990. An election was held in January 1991, which sought the approval of Arlington voters. More people voted in that special election than had voted in the combined Democratic and Republican primaries the year before. The citizens of Arlington approved the agreement by a 65% - 35% margin. The turnout remains the largest in Arlington&#x27;s history for a special election. The Ballpark in Arlington was opened in 1994 on time and on budget. It received rave reviews from fans inside and outside of Arlington.

After passage of the referendum in January 1991, Schieffer was named President of the Rangers and served in that position longer than any other individual has. When George W. Bush became governor in 1995, Schieffer was named to succeed Bush as the team&#x27;s Co-Managing General Partner along with Rusty Rose. The franchise won its first division title in 1996. They won the division again in 1998 and 1999.

The Bush-Rose partnership sold the franchise in 1998 to Dallas investor Tom Hicks. Under the terms of the sale, Schieffer was required to stay as president of the club for an additional year. Schieffer resigned as President of the Rangers in April 1999. While Schieffer was President of the Rangers, he also served as President of the J. Thomas Schieffer Management Company and the Pablo Operating Company, two entities that managed investments and oil and gas properties for clients.

On August 23, 2014, Schieffer was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame for his contributions to the franchise.

==Ambassador of the United States to Australia==
In April 2001, President Bush asked Schieffer to become the Ambassador of the United States to Australia. He accepted and presented his credentials in Canberra on August 23, 2001, as the 22nd representative of the U.S. president. His two immediate predecessors had been Directors-General of the U.S. Foreign Service, although it has been noted that Australian governments sometimes value a U.S. Ambassador&#x27;s personal links to the president currently in office.
Returning to America to attend the first summit between Prime Minister John Howard and President Bush on September 10, 2001, Schieffer was in Washington on September 11, 2001, when the September 11 attacks occurred. Returning to Australia on September 12 with the Prime Minister on board Air Force Two, Schieffer and the White House worked with the Prime Minister and the Australian government to invoke the ANZUS treaty for the first time in its 50-year history so that Australia could come to the aid of the United States as a result of the terrorists&#x27; attack. Subsequently, Schieffer attended five more war time summits with the President and Australian Prime Minister in the next three and a half years as Australia helped America in Afghanistan and Iraq. During his tenure in Canberra, he coordinated closely with the Government of Australia on efforts to fight global terrorism and helped to deepen cooperation on rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

During Schieffer&#x27;s tenure in Australia, the United States also negotiated a free-trade agreement with Australia and significantly deepened the intelligence ties between the two countries. In his report to the State Department, the Inspector General said that Schieffer had exhibited extraordinary leadership and organizational skills in leading the American Embassy in Canberra. The Inspector General said he had examined 83 embassies around the world and had found none that would compare. Later, the State Department recognized the business plan for the Embassy organized by Schieffer as one of the three best in the world. After Bush&#x27;s victory in the November 2004 presidential election, Schieffer announced that he would not be serving another term in Canberra. He returned to the United States at the end of 2004, although he did not formally resign as ambassador until April 1, 2005.

==Ambassador of the United States to Japan==
Based upon his work in Australia, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage recommended to President Bush that Ambassador Schieffer be moved to Japan to replace the retiring former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker as ambassador. Schieffer became one of only three non-career appointees to serve in both the first and second terms of the Bush administration as an Ambassador. On April 1, 2005, Schieffer was sworn in as the 22nd Ambassador of the United States to Japan, having been confirmed by the United States Senate unanimously for the second time.

During his tenure in Japan, Schieffer was again cited by the office of the Inspector General for an exemplary job of leading and managing the 1000-plus personnel embassy. He was also intimately involved in negotiating the most far-reaching reorganization of the U.S.-Japan alliance since the signing of the Security Agreement in 1960. The U.S.-Japan alliance has been and continues to be the linchpin of both countries&#x27; security in Asia and the Pacific. Under the terms of the new agreement, Japan agreed to provide billions of dollars in assistance to the United States to help modernize U.S. facilities in Japan. Schieffer was also instrumental in strengthening the intelligence ties between the two countries. Heavily involved in the six-party talks, which centered on North Korea&#x27;s attempts to become a nuclear weapons state, Schieffer was also praised by both Japan and U.S. officials for diplomatic skills throughout the talks. Schieffer was praised by Japan and U.S. human rights groups for keeping the issue of the abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korean intelligence agents before negotiators. During his time in Japan, Schieffer attended five more summits with the U.S. president and three Japanese prime ministers including the 2008 G-8 Summit in Hokkaido. He departed this post on January 20, 2009.

==Honors==
In November 2013, the Emperor of Japan awarded Schieffer the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun, the highest honor that can be bestowed on a foreigner to recognize his significant contributions in promoting friendly relations and understanding between the United States and Japan. Schieffer was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia, the highest award that can be presented to a foreigner by the Australian government, for his work in strengthening the Australian American Alliance. After ending his almost eight year diplomatic career, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates awarded Schieffer the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest civilian award The Pentagon has to offer, for his work in strengthening the US - Japan Alliance. The Federal Bureau of Investigation honored him for his efforts to combat the international scourge of child pornography. The Director of National Intelligence awarded him the National Intelligence Reform Medal. The Central Intelligence Agency presented him with the Donovan Award. The Defense Intelligence Agency presented him with the Director&#x27;s Award Medal. The National Security Agency presented him the Director&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency presented him its Medallion for Excellence. All of the medals and awards presented to Schieffer by members of the intelligence community were for his work in strengthening and reforming the intelligence cooperation between the United States and Australia, and the United States and Japan.

==Family==
Schieffer is married to Susanne Silber Schieffer, who is originally from San Antonio. She was the director of a small state agency before they were married. They have one son.

==Gubernatorial candidacy==
On March 2, 2009, Tom Schieffer announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to consider seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of Texas in 2010. In June, Schieffer formally announced his candidacy. His campaign stressed the importance of improving education in a fast, globalizing world to enhance the future competitiveness of Texas. Despite raising over $1 million for his campaign, Schieffer withdrew from the race on November 23, 2009, citing an inability to raise enough cash to fund an effective campaign. He urged Houston Mayor Bill White to enter the race instead. White announced his candidacy for governor on December 4, 2009. He would win the Democratic nomination but lose the general election to incumbent Rick Perry.

==Los Angeles Dodgers==
On April 25, 2011, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, who had taken over operations of the struggling Los Angeles Dodgers franchise, announced that he was appointing Schieffer to monitor the club&#x27;s business and financial operations. Schieffer&#x27;s oversight of the franchise ended when the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on June 27, 2011.

<doc id="705393" wikidata="Q1536429" url="?curid=705393" title="The Trashmen">
<text>The Trashmen were an American rock band formed in Minneapolis in 1962 and are best known for their biggest hit, 1963&#x27;s &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;, which reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The original line-up of the group featured guitarists Tony Andreason and Dal Winslow, bassist Bob Reed, and drummer Steve Wahrer.

Along with Colorado-based contemporaries the Astronauts, the Trashmen have been described as &quot;the premier landlocked Midwestern surf group of the &#x27;60s.&quot; The band took their name from &quot;Trashman&#x27;s Blues&quot;, a song written and recorded in 1961 by Minneapolis musician Kai Ray (Richard Caire, 1935–2017), who later wrote songs for the band.

== History ==
=== Pre-Trashmen ===

Tony Andreason and Mike Jann were friends who learned and played guitar together, starting in 1955. They primarily played country. In 1957, at the Crystal Coliseum, Tony and Mike met Steve Wahrer, a drummer, Dallas &quot;Dal&quot; Winslow, a guitar player, and a saxophone player. Tony, Steve, Dal, and the saxophone player played as The String Kings for a brief time period. Mike wasn&#x27;t part of the group, due to being more interested in country music. Tony met Jim Thaxter through Steve and Dale. Jim was a singer who was looking to front a band. &quot;Jim Thaxter and the Travelers&quot; was then formed with the following line-up: Jim Thaxter on lead vocals and guitar (tuned to a bass guitar); Tony Andreason on lead guitar; Dal Winslow on rhythm guitar; Tom Diehl on piano; and Steve Wahrer on drums. In Spring 1961, the group took a break as Tony and Jim had to go into the military. In February or March 1962, the two returned. However, disagreements on musical direction between the two caused Tony to leave the band. Steve and Dal left with him.

=== Early Trashmen ===
Don (Woody) Wood, a bass player, joined the group. Steve made the decision to call the band &quot;The Trashmen&quot; when a friend of Don&#x27;s showed them an album by guitarist Tony Caire, alias Kai Ray, titled &quot;The Trashman&#x27;s Blues.&quot; The group was primarily an instrumental group, with occasional lead vocals by Steve. Steve began to sing more and more. Tony has occasionally sung lead. Don left the band and was replaced by Bob Reed, picked from an audition. The group gained an interest in surf rock after listening to Dick Dale. A song called &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; was conceptualized by Steve and was instantly liked by their audience at shows.

=== &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; as first success ===

The Trashmen&#x27;s biggest hit was 1963&#x27;s &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;, which reached No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the latter part of that year. The song was a combination of two R&amp;B hits by the Rivingtons, &quot;The Bird&#x27;s the Word&quot; and &quot;Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow&quot;. The song was recorded at Kay Bank Studios in Minneapolis. Early pressings of the single credit the Trashmen&#x27;s drummer and vocalist Steve Wahrer as the composer, but following a threat from The Rivingtons&#x27; legal counsel, the writing credit was removed from Wahrer and transferred to the members of The Rivingtons.

The song was later covered by the Ramones, the Cramps, Silverchair, The Psychotic Petunias, Pee-wee Herman, Equipe 84, and the thrash metal band Sodom. It has also been featured in several films, including &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, &quot;Fred Claus&quot;, &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, &quot;Back to the Beach&quot;, and &quot;The Big Year&quot;.

&quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot; was the subject of the episode &quot;I Dream of Jesus&quot; of the television series &quot;Family Guy&quot;, sending the song to No. 8 on the iTunes Top 10 Rock songs chart and No. 50 on the UK Singles Chart in 2009. It has since become a running gag on the show.

In 2010, a Facebook campaign was launched to send the song to No. 1 in the UK over the Christmas season; this was largely intended (as with Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, in 2009) as a protest against the takeover of the Christmas No. 1 spot by &quot;The X Factor&quot; winner&#x27;s song. The track debuted in the UK Top Ten for the first time on December 19, at No. 3.

It was also featured in the video game &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot;.

=== Disbanding ===
Beyond &quot;Surfin&#x27; Bird&quot;, The Trashmen experienced limited success. In 1964, &quot;Bird Dance Beat&quot; reached No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States and was a top 10 hit in Canada. The group disbanded in 1967. A four-CD box set of their work was released by Sundazed Music.

=== Reunion ===
The group made sporadic reunions in the 1970s and 1980s, performing together until Steve Wahrer died of throat cancer in 1989. Later, Tony Andreason&#x27;s brother Mark replaced Wahrer as drummer. Reed&#x27;s son Robin joined as a touring member in 2009 on drums, filling in for Mark Andreason.

In 1999, the Trashmen played at the Las Vegas Grind. They also performed in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Spain in 2007 and 2008.

The Trashmen toured Europe in 2008 and in 2010, performing in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.

The band recorded four tracks at Custom Recording Studios in Golden Valley, Minnesota, with longtime fan and guitarist Deke Dickerson, for the record label Major Label, releasing the 7-inch EP &quot;I&#x27;m a Trashman&quot; in March 2013. A full-length follow-up LP, &quot;Bringing Back the Trash&quot;, was released in April 2014. After several 2015 shows in the band&#x27;s hometown of Minneapolis, the band re-entered retirement.

<text>Dongola (), also known as Urdu or New Dongola, is the capital of Northern State in Sudan, on the banks of the Nile. It should not be confused with Old Dongola, a now deserted medieval city located 80 km upstream on the opposite bank.

== Etymology ==
The word Dongola comes from the Nubian word &quot;Doñqal&quot; which means red brick, as most buildings were made of bricks, thus provoking one of ancient Nubia&#x27;s biggest industries. A more modern use of the word is to describe a strong and hard bulwark, that being so Dongola is often called &quot;the Resident of a large Nile castle&quot;.

== History ==

In the medieval period the region was controlled by the Christian kingdom of Makuria, which until the mid-14th century had its capital at Old Dongola further south. Subsequently Old Dongola became the capital of a smaller kingdom which was integrated into the Islamic Funj Sultanate in the 16th century, which ruled the region until the late 18th century. By the 1820s the town was virtually abandoned.

In 1812 the Mamluks arrived in the Dongola region after they were forced out from Egypt by Muhammad Ali Pasha, establishing a small state. As their capital they chose the small town of Maragha. Growing significantly, it came to be known as Dongola Urdu, New Dongola. In 1820 Muhammad Ali Pasha invaded Sudan and the Mamluks, numbering only 300 men, abandoned the town and fled to the south. The Egyptians made Dongola a provincial capital, which it remained until the outbreak of the Mahdist revolt in the 1880s.
The Nile Expedition of 1884–1885 to relieve Gordon at Khartoum passed through the area. Regiments were challenged to race up the river by boat, and this gave rise to the English regatta competition of dongola racing.

Dongola was the scene of a victory by General Herbert Kitchener over the indigenous Mahdist Muslim tribes in 1896 who later turned it into a British-Egyptian army base with the objective of collecting and storing weapons, gear and resources. Dongola was a considered an all time base for sending campaign reports to Britain, and the first English press release was issued in the name of Dongola Star, with news of the British-Egyptian army in Sudan. Kitchener&#x27;s forces were known for their mercilessness, killing over 15,000 Mahdist troops in the Battle of Omdurman in 1898, and later on proceeded to kill the wounded, raising the overall death toll to over 50,000.

Dongola Road and Dongola Avenue in the Bishopston area of Bristol were named after this event; as was Dongola Road in Tottenham, North London which runs next to Kitchener Road. There is also a Dongola Road in Jersey (Channel Islands). There is a Dongola Road, in Plaistow, East London. There is also a Dongola Road in Ayr, Scotland. In the United States, Dongola, Illinois was established in the 1850s, and named for Dongola. There is also a Dongola Lane in Shakopee, Minnesota, and a Dongola Hwy. in Conway, South Carolina.

==Population==
Dongolawis originate from early indigenous Nubian Sub Saharan African inhabitants with many taking pride in their mostly non-mixed ancestry; although always faced with criticism this helped preserve the Nilo Saharan Dongolawi Nubian language (sometimes pejoratively referred to as Rotana); however, cultural preferences are slowly changing.

== Transport ==
The trans-African automobile route — the Cairo-Cape Town Highway passes through Dongola.

== Climate ==
Dongola has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) as it is located in the Sahara Desert, one of the hottest, sunniest and driest regions in the world. The temperature is warm or hot year-round, with January, the coolest month, having a mean of and an average low of . June has the highest average high of , while August has the highest average low at . On 22 June 2010, Dongola recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature that has been recorded in Sudan. The lowest recorded temperature was in January.

Dongola receives only of precipitation annually because of its arid location. September is the wettest month, receiving of rain on average. Rainfall is sporadic but more likely to occur in the summer. Six months receive no precipitation at all. Humidity is low year-round, but it is higher in winter. Dongola receives 3813.8 hours of sunshine annually, which is 87% of all possible sunshine. June has the most sunshine and September has the least.

<text>The Tank Man (also known as the Unknown Protester or Unknown Rebel) is the nickname given to an unidentified individual, presumed to be a Chinese man, who stood in front of a column of Type 59 tanks leaving Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 5, 1989. On the previous day, the government of China cleared the square of protesting students after six weeks of standoff, in the process killing hundreds or even thousands of people mostly in other parts of Beijing. The lead tank halted to avoid running him over; the man then climbed on top of the tank where the PLA soldiers talked to the man. The incident was filmed and shared to a worldwide audience. Internationally, it is considered one of the most iconic images of all time. Inside China, the image and the accompanying events are subject to censorship.

Many documentaries and related exhibitions about the June 4th Tiananmen Square Incident mention the incident of protesters blocking tanks, and regard the &quot;Tank Man&quot; as an iconic symbol of the incident. It has long been circulated that the protester&#x27;s name is &quot;Wang Weilin&quot;. The name first appeared in the British Sunday Express in its English pinyin &quot;Wang Weilin&quot;. However, Tank Man&#x27;s exact identity and whereabouts remain unknown, and different news media have different names for the protester. The PBS program Frontline produced a documentary about the incident in 2006.

The news documentary “Flying the Flag of the Republic” produced by the August 1st Film Studio described the man as a “gangster who tried to stop a car with his barehands”. Western society calls this man &quot;Tank Man&quot; or &quot;Unknown Protester&quot;. In April 1998, Time magazine named the man &quot;The Unknown Rebel&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. In 2003, Life magazine published a book called “100 Photos That Changed the World” which also included photos of people blocking a tank convoy. Although the relevant images are regarded as an iconic symbol of the 20th century, the Chinese government prohibits the circulation of relevant images on the Internet, which means that most Chinese people are not aware of them. In September 2019, one of the photographers for the photo, Charlie Cole, died in Bali, Indonesia.

There is no reliable information about the identity or fate of Tank Man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown. At least one witness has stated that Tank Man was not the only person to have blocked the tanks during the protest.

== Obstruction ==
At the northeast edge of Tiananmen Square, along Chang&#x27;an Avenue, shortly after noon on June 5, 1989, the day after the Chinese government&#x27;s violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests, &quot;Tank Man&quot; stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester.&quot; He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags. As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured at them with one of the bags. Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver&#x27;s hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank&#x27;s turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner&#x27;s hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The man is then seen briefly speaking with a second person who is walking his bicycle across the street in front of the stationary tanks, as they begin to start their engines again. It is unclear if he is still seeking to obstruct the tanks.

At this point, the video footage shows two figures in blue running over to pull the man away and lead him to a nearby crowd; the tanks then continued on their way. Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. Charlie Cole, who was there for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, claimed it was the Chinese government agents, while Jan Wong, who was there for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders.

== Identity and disappearance ==
Little is publicly known of the man&#x27;s identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, London newspaper &quot;Sunday Express&quot; named him as Wang Weilin (), a 19-year-old student who was later charged with &quot;political hooliganism&quot; and &quot;attempting to subvert members of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.&quot; This claim has been rejected by internal Chinese Communist Party documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights. One party member was quoted as saying: &quot;We can&#x27;t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can&#x27;t find him among the dead or among those in prison.&quot; Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man&#x27;s identity and current whereabouts.

There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President&#x27;s Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to US President Richard Nixon, alleged that he was executed 14 days later; other sources alleged he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests. In &quot;Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now&quot;, Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have &quot;no idea who he was either&quot; and that he is still alive somewhere on the mainland. Another theory is that he escaped to Taiwan and remains employed there as an archaeologist in the National Palace Museum. This was first reported by the Yonhap news agency in South Korea.

The Chinese government has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. The government denounced him as a &quot;scoundrel&quot; once on state television, but it was never shown publicly again. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), &quot;I can&#x27;t confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not&quot;, and then replied in English, &quot;I think [that he was] never killed.&quot; The government also argued that the incident evidenced the &quot;humanity&quot; of the country&#x27;s military.

In a 2000 interview with Mike Wallace, Jiang said, &quot;He was never arrested.&quot; He then stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where he is now.&quot; He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man over.

In July 2017, it was reported by Apple Daily that the Tank Man&#x27;s real name may be Zhang Weimin (), a native of Shijingshan, Beijing, who was 24 years old in 1989. The man who gave the story claimed that he was in the same cell with Zhang in Beijing Yanqing Prison. The verdict stated that he smashed a tank with a brick and was initially sentenced to life imprisonment, which was later reduced to 20 years. After winning an award in Yanqing Prison, he was released on parole in 2007. However, after being released from prison, he had no relatives or housing, and developed a gambling habit. A few years later, he was imprisoned in Kenhua Prison (located in Tianjin and managed by Beijing), and his sentence was increased by two years. Zhang Weimin was being held in the 11th division of Kenhua Prison, and at the time of the article was expected to be released shortly.

== Censorship ==

In 2006, a PBS interview of six experts observed that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship. Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China. When undergraduate students at Beijing University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the photograph 16 years later, they were &quot;genuinely mystified&quot;. One of the students said that the image was &quot;artwork&quot;.

It has been suggested that the &quot;Unknown Rebel&quot;, if still alive, would never have made himself known as he may have been unaware of his international recognition due to the Chinese media suppression of events relating to the government protests.

After the events in the square, the local public security bureau treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offenses such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.

On August 20, 2020, a trailer for &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&quot; showed footage of Tank Man. On video platforms in China like Bilibili, the segment of the trailer was replaced with a black screen. The next day, Activision Blizzard released a shorter version of the trailer worldwide that did not include the scene.

On June 4, 2021, the 32nd anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, searches for the Tank Man image and videos were censored by Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search engine worldwide. Hours after Microsoft acknowledged the issue, the search returned only pictures of tanks elsewhere in the world. Search engines that license results from Microsoft such as DuckDuckGo and Yahoo faced similar issues. Microsoft said the issue was &quot;due to an accidental human error.&quot; The director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, said the idea that it was an inadvertent error is &quot;hard to believe&quot;. David Greene, Civil Liberties Director at Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that content moderation was impossible to do perfectly and &quot;egregious mistakes are made all the time&quot;, but he further elaborated that &quot;At worst, this was purposeful suppression at the request of a powerful state.&quot;

== Photographic versions ==
Five photographers managed to capture the event on film that was later confiscated by the PSB. On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.

The widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.

The most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about away from the scene. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter. American exchange student Kirk Martsen unexpectedly met Widener in the hotel lobby, and upon request he allowed Widener to take photos from his hotel room. Circumstances were against the photographer who recalled that the picture was almost not taken. Widener was injured, suffering from the flu and running out of film. Martsen, the college student, hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing Widener to make the shot. Martsen then smuggled the film out of the hotel, and delivered it to the Beijing Associated Press office. Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers. He was also nominated for the Pulitzer Prize but did not win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of all time.
Charlie Cole, working for &quot;Newsweek&quot; and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to &quot;Newsweek&quot;. He was awarded the 1990 World Press Photo of the Year and the picture was featured in &quot;Life&quot; &quot;100 Photographs That Changed the World&quot; in 2003.

On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter Terril Jones revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.

Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel, but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen. It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener&#x27;s work, they re-checked Tsang&#x27;s negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener&#x27;s. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Tsang told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A foreign photographer accompanying him suddenly said, &quot;I am not gonna die for your country&quot;, and left. Tsang returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.

In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the globe. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua, Cable News Network (CNN) cameraman Jonathan Schaer and National Broadcasting Company (NBC) cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene. ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting from the balcony.

== Legacy ==
In April 1998, &quot;Time&quot; included the &quot;Unknown Rebel&quot; in a feature titled &quot;Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century&quot;. In November 2016, &quot;Time&quot; included the photograph by Jeff Widener in &quot;Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time&quot;. Although the images of the Tank Man are regarded as iconic symbols of the 20th century, due to the Chinese government prohibiting the circulation of related images on the Internet, most young people in China do not recognize the photograph.

== In media ==
In the 1999 Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young song &quot;Stand and Be Counted&quot;, from the album &quot;Looking Forward&quot;, David Crosby sings of his gratitude to Tank Man, whose photograph he had framed and mounted.

A similar scene is depicted in the music video for &quot;Only One&quot; (2003) by the American rock band Yellowcard as well as &quot;Club Foot&quot; (2004) by the English rock band Kasabian.

A fictionalized version of the fates of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in Lucy Kirkwood&#x27;s 2013 play &quot;Chimerica&quot;, which premiered at the Almeida Theatre from May 20, 2013, to July 6, 2013.

On June 4, 2013, Sina Weibo, China&#x27;s most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are &quot;today&quot;, &quot;tonight&quot;, &quot;June 4&quot;, and &quot;big yellow duck&quot;. If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a photoshopped version of Tank Man, in which rubber ducks replaced the tanks, had been circulating around Twitter—a reference to Florentijn Hofman&#x27;s &quot;Rubber Duck&quot; sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong&#x27;s Victoria Harbour.

In April 2019, Leica Camera released an advert depicting photographers in intense political climates, including 1989 China. The five-minute short ends with a photographer shooting from a hotel window with the Tank Man image reflected in his lens despite the fact that the original photograph was taken with a Nikon camera. Following censorship of the Leica brand on Sina Weibo, Leica revoked the advert and sought to distance themselves from it.

The animated series &quot;The Amazing World of Gumball&quot; referenced the moment in the episode &quot;The Fraud&quot;, in which the character Mr. Small tries to halt Principal Nigel Brown by standing in front of him as a symbolic gesture of protest. Small holds bags while Brown leaves tank treads as he walks forward.

<doc id="705408" wikidata="Q2078412" url="?curid=705408" title="Islam in China">
<text>Islam has been practiced in China since the 7th century CE. There are an estimated 17–25 million Muslims in China, less than 2 percent of the total population. Though Hui Muslims are the most numerous group, the greatest concentration of Muslims reside in northwestern China&#x27;s Xinjiang autonomous region, which contains a significant Uyghur population. Lesser yet significant populations reside in the regions of Ningxia, Gansu and Qinghai. Of China&#x27;s 55 officially recognized minority peoples, ten of these groups are predominantly Sunni Muslim.

==History==

The Silk Road, which comprised a series of extensive inland trade routes that spread all over the Mediterranean to East Asia, was used since 1000 BCE and continued to be used for millennia. For more than half of this long period of time, most of the traders were Muslim and moved towards the East. Not only did these traders bring their goods, they also carried with them their culture and beliefs to East Asia. Islam was one of the many religions that gradually began to spread across the Silk Road during the &quot;7th to the 10th centuries through war, trade and diplomatic exchanges&quot;.

During the Tang and Song dynasties, Muslims in China worshipped various kinds of &quot;spirits&quot; alongside Allah.

===Tang dynasty===
According to Chinese Muslims&#x27; traditional accounts, Islam was first introduced to China in 616–18 by the Companions of Muhammad: Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, Wahab ibn Abu Kabcha and another. It is noted in other accounts that Wahab Abu Kabcha reached Canton by sea in 629 CE.

The introduction of Islam mainly happened through two routes: from the southeast following an established path to Guangdong and from the northwest through the Silk Road. Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, along with the Companion Suhayla Abu Arja and Hassan ibn Thabit, and the &quot;Tabi&#x27;un&quot; Owais al-Qarani, returned to China from the Arabian Peninsula in 637 by the Yunnan-Manipur-Chittagong route, then reached Arabia by sea. Some sources date the introduction of Islam in China to 650 CE, the third sojourn of Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas, when he was sent as an official envoy to Tang emperor Gaozong during the reign of the Rashid Caliph Uthman&#x27;s reign. Emperor Gaozong, the Tang emperor who is said to have received the envoy then ordered the construction of the Huaisheng Mosque in Guangzhou in memory of Muhammad, which was the first mosque in the country.

While modern secular historians tend to say that there is no evidence that Waqqas himself ever came to China, they do believe that Muslim diplomats and merchants came to Tang China within a few decades from the beginning of the Muslim era.

The early Tang dynasty had a cosmopolitan culture, with intensive contacts with Central Asia and significant communities of (originally non-Muslim) Central and Western Asian merchants resident in Chinese cities, which helped the introduction of Islam. The first major Muslim settlements in China consisted of Arab and Persian merchants, with comparatively well-established, even if somewhat segregated, mercantile Muslim communities existing in the port cities of Guangzhou, Quanzhou and Hangzhou on China&#x27;s southeastern seaboard, as well as in the interior centers such as Chang&#x27;an, Kaifeng and Yangzhou during the Tang and especially Song eras.
Around 879, Chinese rebels killed about 120,000–200,000 mostly Arab and Persian foreigners in Guanzhou in the Guangzhou massacre. It is believed that the profile of Muslims as traders led to the government ignoring Muslims in the 845 Huichang persecution of Buddhism, even though it virtually extinguished Zoroastrianism and the Church of the East in China.

In 751, the Abbasid Caliphate defeated Tang China at the Battle of Talas, marking the end of Tang westward expansion and resulting in Muslim control of Transoxiana for the next 400 years.

===Song dynasty===

By the time of the Song dynasty, Muslims had come to play a major role in the import/export industry. The office of Director General of Shipping was consistently held by a Muslim during this period. In 1070, the Song emperor Shenzong invited 5,300 Muslims from Bukhara, to settle in Song China in order to create a buffer zone between the Song and the Liao dynasties in the northeast. Later on, these Muslims settled between the Sung capital of Kaifeng and Yenching (modern day Beijing). They were led by Prince Amir Sayyid &quot;Su-fei-er&quot; (his Chinese name), who was called the &quot;father&quot; of the Muslim community in China. Prior to him, Islam was named by the Tang and Song Chinese as &quot;Dashi fa&quot; (&quot;law of the Arabs&quot;). He renamed it to &quot;Huihui Jiao&quot; (&quot;the Religion of the Huihui&quot;).

It is reported that &quot;in 1080, another group of more than 10,000 Arab men and women are said to have arrived in China on horsebacks to join Sofeier. These people settled in all provinces&quot;. Pu Shougeng, a Muslim foreign trader, stands out in his work to help the Yuan conquer Southern China, the last outpost of Song power. In 1276, Song loyalists launched a resistance against Mongol efforts to take over Fuzhou. The Yuanshih (Yuan dynasty official history) records that Pu Shougeng &quot;abandoned the Song cause and rejected the emperor...by the end of the year, Quanzhou submitted to the Mongols&quot;. In abandoning the Song cause, Pu Shougeng mobilized troops from the community of foreign residents, who massacred the Song emperor&#x27;s relatives and Song loyalists. Pu Shougeng and his troops acted without the help of the Mongol army. Pu Shougeng himself was lavishly rewarded by the Mongols. He was appointed military commissioner for Fujian and Guangdong.

====Tombs of Imams====

On the foothills of Mount Lingshan are the tombs of two of the four companions that Muhammad sent eastwards to preach Islam. Known as the &#x27;Holy Tombs&#x27;, they house the companions Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun. The other two companions went to Guangzhou and Yangzhou. The Imam Asim, is said to have been one of the first Islamic missionaries in China. He was a man who lived in c. 1000 CE in Hotan. The shrine site includes the reputed tomb of the Imam, a mosque, and several related tombs. There is also a maqam of the Shia Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq.

===Yuan dynasty===
Bukhara and Samarqand were visited by Qiu Chuji. At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent ethnic Han and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara and Samarqand in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. The surname of Li was held by one of Yelu Ahai&#x27;s staff of Han descent. There were various Han craftsmen. Tangut, Khitan and Han peoples took control over gardens and fields from the Muslims. Han people were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers.

During the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), large numbers of Muslims settled in China. The Mongols, a minority in China, gave foreign immigrants, such as Buddhists, Christians, Muslims and Jews from West Asia an elevated status over locals including Khitan and Jurchens as part of their governing strategy, thus giving Muslims a heavy influence. Mongols recruited and forcibly relocated hundreds of thousands of Muslim immigrants from Western and Central Asia to help them administer their rapidly expanding empire. The Mongols used Arab, Persian and Buddhist Uyghur administrators, generically known as &quot;semu&quot; [色目] (&quot;various eye color&quot;), to act as officers of taxation and finance. Muslims headed many corporations in China in the early Yuan period. Muslim scholars were brought to work on calendar making and astronomy. The architect Yeheidie&#x27;erding (Amir al-Din) learned from Han architecture to help design the construction of the capital of the Yuan dynasty, Dadu (also known as Khanbaliq or present-day Beijing).
Genghis Khan and his successors forbade Islamic practices like halal butchering, as well as other restrictions. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret. Genghis Khan outright called Muslims and Jews &quot;slaves&quot;, and demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal method. Circumcision was also forbidden. Jews were affected by these laws and forbidden by the Mongols to eat Kosher. Towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, corruption and persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined the Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The founder of the Ming dynasty, Hongwu Emperor, led Muslim generals like Lan Yu against the Mongols, whom they defeated in combat. Some Muslim communities had a name in Chinese which meant &quot;barracks&quot; or &quot;thanks&quot;, which many Hui Muslims claim comes from the gratitude which Chinese people have towards them for their role in defeating the Mongols.

===Ming dynasty===



During the following Ming dynasty, Muslims continued to be influential around government circles. Six of Ming dynasty founder Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s most trusted generals are said to have been Muslim, including Lan Yu who, in 1388, led a strong imperial Ming army out of the Great Wall and won a decisive victory over the Mongols in Mongolia, effectively ending the Mongol dream to re-conquer China. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang&#x27;s armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. Zhu Yuanzhang also wrote a praise of Islam, The Hundred-word Eulogy. It was recorded that &quot;His Majesty ordered to have mosques built in Xijing and Nanjing [the capital cities], and in southern Yunnan, Fujian and Guangdong. His Majesty also personally wrote baizizan [a eulogy] in praise of the Prophet&#x27;s virtues.&quot; Additionally, the Yongle Emperor hired Zheng He, perhaps the most famous Chinese of Muslim birth although at least in later life not a Muslim himself, to lead seven expeditions to the Indian Ocean from 1405 and 1433. However, during the Ming dynasty, new immigration to China from Muslim countries was restricted in an increasingly isolationist nation. The Muslims in China who were descended from earlier immigration began to assimilate by speaking Chinese and by adopting Chinese names and culture. Mosque architecture began to follow traditional Chinese architecture. This era, sometimes considered the Golden Age of Islam in China, also saw Nanjing become an important center of Islamic study.

Taoism and Confucianism influenced Islam around and before this time, and because of their influence and the lack of proficiency many imams had with writing in Chinese, many Muslims had vastly different conceptions of God from Muslims in western countries. They also came up with Taoist-influenced names for Allah different from the typical 99 names.
Muslims in Ming dynasty Beijing were given relative freedom by the Chinese, with no restrictions placed on their religious practices or freedom of worship and being normal citizens in Beijing. In contrast to the freedom granted to Muslims, followers of Tibetan Buddhism and Catholicism suffered from restrictions and censure in Beijing.

The Hongwu Emperor decreed the building of multiple mosques throughout China in many locations. A Nanjing mosque was built by the Xuande Emperor. Weizhou Grand Mosque, considered as one of the most beautiful, was constructed during the Ming dynasty.

When the Qing dynasty invaded the Ming dynasty in 1644, Muslim Ming loyalists led by Muslim leaders Milayin, Ding Guodong and Ma Shouying led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the Milayin rebellion in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince of Yanchang Zhu Shichuan to the throne as the emperor. The Muslim Ming loyalists were crushed by the Qing with 100,000 of them, including Milayin and Ding Guodong killed.

===Qing dynasty===
The Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1912) witnessed multiple revolts, with several major revolts headed by Muslim leaders. During the Qing dynasty&#x27;s conquest of the Ming dynasty from 1644; Muslim Ming loyalists in Gansu led by Muslim leaders Milayin and Ding Guodong led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the Milayin rebellion in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince Zhu Shichuan to the throne as emperor. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by Hami&#x27;s Sultan Sa&#x27;id Baba and his son Prince Turumtay. The Muslim Ming loyalists were joined by Tibetan and Han peoples in the revolt. After fierce fighting, and negotiations, a peace agreement was agreed in 1649, where Milayan and Ding nominally pledged allegiance to the Qing and were given ranks as members of the military. When the other Ming loyalists in southern China resumed hostilities, the Qing were forced to withdraw their forces from Gansu to fight them, Milayan and Ding once again took up arms and rebelled against the Qing. The Muslim Ming loyalists were then crushed by the Qing with 100,000 of them, including Milayin, Ding Guodong, and Turumtay killed in battle.

The Confucian Hui Muslim scholar Ma Zhu (1640–1710) served with the Southern Ming loyalists against the Qing. Zhu Yu&#x27;ai (the Ming Prince Gui) was accompanied by Hui refugees when he fled from Huguang to the Burmese border in Yunnan and as a mark of their defiance against the Qing and loyalty to the Ming, they changed their surname to Ming.

In Guangzhou, the national monuments known as &quot;The Muslim&#x27;s Loyal Trio&quot; are the tombs of Ming loyalist Muslims who were martyred while fighting in battle against the Qing during the Ming–Qing transition period in Guangzhou. The Ming Muslim loyalists were called &quot;Jiaomen sanzhong&quot; &quot;Three defenders of the faith&quot;.

The Muslim revolt in the northwest occurred due to violent and bloody infighting between Muslim groups (Gedimu, Khafiya and Jahriyya). The rebellion in Yunnan occurred because of repression by Qing officials, resulting in bloody Hui rebellions, most notably the Dungan revolt, which occurred mostly in Xinjiang, Shaanxi and Gansu, from 1862 to 1877. The Manchu government ordered the execution of several million rebels in the Dungan revolt. The Hui Muslim population of Beijing was unaffected from the Muslim rebels during the Dungan revolt.

Elisabeth Allès wrote that the relationship between Hui Muslim and Han peoples continued normally in the Henan area, with no ramifications or consequences from the Muslim rebellions of other areas. Allès wrote &quot;the major Muslim revolts in the mid-19th century which involved the Hui in Shaanxi, Gansu and Yunnan, as well as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, do not seem to have had any direct effect on this region of the central plain.&quot;

However, many Muslims like Ma Zhan&#x27;ao, Ma Anliang, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Qianling and Ma Julung defected to the Qing dynasty and helped the Qing General Zuo Zongtang exterminate the Muslim rebels. These Muslim generals belonged to the Khafiya sect, and they abetted in the Qing massacre of Jahariyya rebels. Zuo relocated the Han from Hezhou as a reward for the Muslims for helping the Qing to kill other Muslim rebels. In 1895, another Dungan Revolt broke out, and loyalist Muslims such as Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang, Ma Guoliang, Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang suppressed and massacred the rebel Muslims led by Ma Dahan, Ma Yonglin and Ma Wanfu. The Muslim army, Kansu Braves, led by General Dong Fuxiang fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion. They included well known generals like Ma Anliang, Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang.

In Yunnan, the Qing armies exterminated only the Muslims who had rebelled and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising.

Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr. The Qing dynasty enfeoffed (granted freehold property in exchange for pledged service) the rulers of Turpan, in eastern present-day Xinjiang and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs. Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin.

Many Muslims chose to live among Confucians, worshipped Chinese gods and Allah, and perform religious functions, including prayer, in Confucian temples as well as mosques during the late Qing dynasty, and likely before then as well. Some even prostrated before idols and made offerings to them.

===Republic of China===

In the 1900s decade, its estimated that there were 20 million Muslims in China proper (that is, China excluding the regions of Mongolia and Xinjiang). Of these, almost half resided in Gansu, over a third in Shaanxi (as defined at that time) and the rest in Yunnan.

The Qing dynasty fell in 1912, and the Republic of China was established by Sun Yat-sen, who immediately proclaimed the equality of the Han, Hui, Manchu, Mongol, and Tibetan peoples. This led to some improvement in relations between these different peoples. The end of dynasty also marked an increase in Sino-foreign interactions. This led to increased contact between Muslim minorities in China and the Islamic states of the Middle East. In 1912, the Chinese Muslim Federation was formed in the capital Nanjing. Similar organization formed in Beijing (1912), Shanghai (1925) and Jinan (1934).

In the 1910s, many Chinese Muslims syncretized their beliefs with Confucianism, and worshipped Chinese gods alongside Allah.

During the rule of the Kuomintang party, Muslim warlords (such as the Ma clique) were appointed as military governors of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia. Bai Chongxi was a Muslim General and Defence Minister of China during this time.

During the Second Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui by April 1941. The Hui of Dachang was subjected to slaughter by the Japanese. During the Rape of Nanking, the mosques contained dead bodies after the Japanese slaughters. According to Wan Lei, &quot;statistics showed that the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui people by April 1941.&quot; The Japanese followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless. Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation. This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to serve as sex slaves. Hui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons. Many Hui fought in the war against Japan.

In 1937, during the Battle of Beiping–Tianjin, the Chinese government received a telegram from Muslim General Ma Bufang that he was prepared to fight the Japanese. Immediately after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma Bufang arranged for a cavalry division under the Muslim General Ma Biao to be sent east to battle the Japanese. Ethnic Turkic Salar Muslims made up the majority of the first cavalry division which was sent by Ma Bufang.

By 1939, at least 33 Hui Muslims had studied at Cairo&#x27;s Al-Azhar University. Before the Sino-Japanese War of 1937, there existed more than a hundred known Muslim periodicals. Thirty journals were published between 1911 and 1937. Although the Linxia region remained a center of religious activities, many Muslim cultural activities had shifted to Beijing. National organizations like the Chinese Muslim Association were established for Muslims. Muslims served extensively in the National Revolutionary Army and reached positions of importance, like General Bai Chongxi, who became Defence Minister of the Republic of China.

In the Kuomintang Islamic insurgency, Muslim Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army forces in Northwest China, in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, as well as Yunnan, continued an unsuccessful insurgency against the communists from 1950 to 1958, after the general civil war was over. Muslims affiliated with the Kuomintang also moved to Taiwan within this time.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===

When the People&#x27;s Republic of China was established in 1949, Muslims, along with all other religions in China, suffered repression especially during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). Islam, like all religions including traditional Chinese religion, was persecuted by the Red Guards who were encouraged to smash the Four Olds. Numerous places of worship, including mosques, were attacked.

In 1975, in what would be known as the Shadian incident, there was an uprising among Hui Muslims and became the only large scale ethnic rebellion during the Cultural Revolution. In crushing the rebellion, the PLA massacred 1,600 Hui with MIG fighter jets used to fire rockets onto the village. Following the fall of the Gang of Four, apologies and reparations were made. During that time, the government also constantly accused Muslims and other religious groups of holding &quot;superstitious beliefs&quot; and promoting &quot;anti-socialist trends&quot;. The government began to relax its policies towards Muslims in 1978.

After the advent of Deng Xiaoping in 1979, Muslims enjoyed a period of liberalisation. New legislation gave all minorities the freedom to use their own spoken and written languages, to develop their own culture and education and to practice their religion. More Chinese Muslims than ever before were allowed to go on pilgrimage to Mecca.

There is an ethnic separatist movement among the Uyghur minority, who are a Turkic people with their own language. Uyghur separatists are intent on establishing their own state, which existed for a few years in the 1930s and as a Soviet Communist puppet state, the Second East Turkestan Republic in 1944–1950. The Soviet Union supported Uyghur separatists against China during the Sino-Soviet split. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, China feared potential separatist goals of the Muslim majority in Xinjiang.

In the past, celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca was encouraged by the Chinese government for Uyghur members of the Communist party. From 1979 to 1989, 350 mosques were built in Turpan. Whereas 30 years later, the government was building &quot;re-education&quot; camps for interning Muslims without charge in Turpan.

In 1989, China banned a book titled &quot;Xing Fengsu&quot; (&quot;Sexual Customs&quot;) which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by the Hui, during which the police provided protection to the Hui protestors and the government organized public burnings of the book. Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.

Since the 1980s, Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools (中阿學校)) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government in Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there. After secondary education is completed, Hui students are permitted to embark on religious studies under an Imam.

==== 21st century ====
In 2007, anticipating the coming &quot;Year of the Pig&quot; in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV &quot;to avoid conflicts with Muslim minorities&quot;. This is believed to refer to China&#x27;s population of 20 million Muslims (to whom pigs are considered &quot;unclean&quot;). Hui Muslims enjoy freedoms such as practising their religion, building mosques at which their children attend, while Uyghurs in Xinjiang experience more strict controls.

There are about 24,400 mosques in Xinjiang, an average of one mosque for every 530 Muslims, which is higher than the number of churches per Christian person in England.

In March 2014, the Chinese media estimated that there were around 300 Chinese Muslims active in ISIS territories. The Chinese government stated in May 2015 that it would not tolerate any form of terrorism and would work to &quot;combat terrorist forces, including ETIM, [to] safeguard global peace, security and stability.&quot;

Muslims were reported in 2015 to have been featured as hosts and directors on the Chinese New Year Gala.

In response to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting, Chinese state-run media attacked Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons insulting Muhammad, with the state-run &quot;Xinhua&quot; advocating limiting freedom of speech, while the Chinese Communist Party-owned tabloid &quot;Global Times&quot; said the attack was &quot;payback&quot; for what it characterised as Western colonialism and accusing Charlie Hebdo of trying to incite a clash of civilizations.

In the five years to 2017, a 306% rise in criminal arrests was seen in Xinjiang and the arrests there accounted for 21% of the national total, despite the region contributing just 1.5% of the population. The increase was seen as driven by the government&#x27;s &quot;Strike Hard&quot; campaign. In 2017, driven by a 92% in security spending there that year, an estimated 227,882 criminal arrests were made in Xinjiang.

In August 2018, the authorities were vigorously pursuing the suppression of mosques, including their widespread destruction, over Muslim protests. Also at that time, the growing of long beards and the wearing of veils or Islamic robes for Uyghurs, were banned. All vehicle owners were required to install GPS tracking devices.

NPR reported that from 2018 to 2020 the repression of non-Uyghur Muslims intensified. Imams have been restricted to practicing within the region their household is registered in. Prior to these restrictions China had hundreds of itinerant Imams. During this period the Chinese government forced nearly all mosques in Ningxia and Henan to remove their domes and Arabic script. In 2018 new language restrictions forced hundreds of Arabic schools in Ningxia and Zhengzhou to close.

A 2019 paper from the Gallatin School of Individualized Study interviewed Hui Muslims in Xining, Lanzhou, and Yinchuan and found that none saw the recent policies or government as detrimental to their religious lives. Although some foresaw a future of Islam in China much different than what they were used to, they did not seem to worry if it was good or bad as long as they had access to mosques, halal food and security. Arabic calligraphy was also reported by &quot;The Hindu&quot; in 2019 to be commonplace at the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. &quot;The National&quot; reported in the same year of a female ahong in Xi&#x27;an teaching those in her mosque how to pray and read the Quran in Arabic.

Chinese Muslims reportedly celebrated Ramadan on 2021 in the cities of Shanghai and Beijing. &quot;The Star&quot; reported in the same year that Uyghurs in Xinjiang made prayers for Aidilfitri.

A policy to sincize all mosques had effectively transformed all major Islamic houses of worship by May 2024.

==== Repression of Uyghurs ====

By 2013, the repression of Uyghurs extended to the disappearance of dissidents and the imposition of life imprisonment sentences on academics who were convicted of promoting social interactions between Uyghurs. Hui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan unlike Uyghurs in the same positions, the number of Huí going on Hajj was reported to be expanding in 2014 and Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them. Uyghurs find it difficult to get passports to go on Hajj. The Xinjiang Muslim Association in China and the Chinese embassy in Malaysia have denied that Uyghurs are banned from fasting, inviting foreigners to come see it for themselves.

In July 2014, Reuters reported that Uyghurs in Shanghai could practise their religion, with some expressing more freedom there than in Xinjiang.

The Associated Press (AP) reported in late November 2018 that Uyghur families were required to allow local government officials to live in their homes as &quot;relatives&quot; in a &quot;Pair Up and Become Family&quot; campaign. While the official was living in a home, the residents were closely watched and not allowed to pray or wear religious clothing. Authorities said that the program was voluntary but Muslims who were interviewed by AP expressed concern that refusal to cooperate would lead to serious repercussions.

As of 2024, a significant new wave of Chinese Uyghur Muslims is fleeing religious persecution in Xinjiang Province and seeking religious freedom in New York City.

==== Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence ====
In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang&#x27;s rule in Qinghai such as the Ngolok rebellions (1917–1949) and the Sino-Tibetan War. Violence subsided after 1949 under Communist Party repression but reignited as strictures were relaxed.

Riots broke out in March 2008 between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as suspected human bones in and deliberate contamination of soups served in Muslim-owned establishments and overpricing of balloons by Muslim vendors. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans resulted in Muslim deaths and riots. The Tibetan exile community sought to suppress reports reaching the international community, fearing damage to the cause of Tibetan autonomy and fueling Hui Muslim support of government repression of Tibetans generally. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims). The main mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans during the unrest.

The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes.

==== Internment camps and restrictions on religious freedom ====
The Xinjiang internment camps are officially called &quot;Vocational Education and Training Centers&quot; by the Chinese government. The camps have been operated by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Regional government since 2014. However, the efforts of the camps strongly intensified after a change of head for the region. Alongside the Uyghurs, other Muslim minorities have also been reported to be held in these internment camps. As of 2019, 23 nations in the United Nations have signed a letter condemning China for the camps and asking them to close them.

In May 2018, news media outlets reported that hundreds of thousands of Muslims were being detained in massive extrajudicial internment camps in western Xinjiang. These were called s &quot;re-education&quot; camps and later, &quot;vocational training centres&quot; by the government, intended for the &quot;rehabilitation and redemption&quot; to combat terrorism and religious extremism.

In August 2018, the United Nations said that credible reports had led it to estimate that up to a million Uyghurs and other Muslims were being held in &quot;something that resembles a massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy&quot;. The U.N.&#x27;s International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination said that some estimates indicated that up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslims were held in &quot;political camps for indoctrination&quot;, in a &quot;no-rights zone&quot;. By that time, conditions in Xinjiang had deteriorated so far that they were described by political scientists as &quot;Orwellian&quot; and observers drew comparisons with Nazi concentration camps. In response to the UN panel&#x27;s finding of indefinite detention without due process, the Chinese government delegation officially conceded that it was engaging in widespread &quot;resettlement and re-education&quot; and state media described the controls in Xinjiang as &quot;intense&quot;, but not permanent.

On 31 August 2018, the United Nations committee called on the Chinese government to &quot;end the practice of detention without lawful charge, trial and conviction&quot;, to release the detained persons, to provide specifics as to the number of interred individuals and the reasons for their detention and to investigate the allegations of &quot;racial, ethnic and ethno-religious profiling&quot;. A BBC report quoted an unnamed Chinese official as saying that &quot;Uighurs enjoyed full rights&quot;, pointing out that &quot;those deceived by religious extremism ... shall be assisted by resettlement and re-education&quot;.

In October 2018, BBC News published an investigative exposé claiming based on satellite imagery and testimony that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are being held without trial in internment camps in Xinjiang. On the other hand, the United States Department of Defense believes that around 1 million to 3 million people have been detained and placed in the internment camps. Some sources quoted in the article say &quot;as far as I know, the Chinese government wants to remove Uyghur identity from the world.&quot; The New York Times suggests that China has been successful in keeping countries, notably Muslim majority nations, to be quiet about the camps in Xinjiang due to its diplomatic and economic power, but when countries do decide to criticize the country, they do so in groups in hopes of lessening punishments from China.

On 28 April 2020, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom issued the &quot;International Religious Freedom Annual Report 2020&quot; . The report states that &quot;individuals have been sent to the camps for wearing long beards, refusing alcohol, or other behaviors authorities deem to be signs of &quot;religious extremism&quot;. Former detainees report that they suffered torture, rape, sterilization, and other abuses. In addition, nearly half a million Muslim children have been separated from their families and placed in boarding schools. During 2019, the camps increasingly transitioned from &quot;reeducation&quot; to forced labor as detainees were forced to work in cotton and textile factories. Outside the camps, the government continued to deploy officials to live with Muslim families and to report on any signs of &quot;extremist&quot; religious behavior. Meanwhile, authorities in Xinjiang and other parts of China have destroyed or damaged thousands of mosques and removed Arabic-language signs from Muslim businesses.&quot;

On 17 June 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which authorizes the imposition of U.S. sanctions against Chinese government officials responsible for internment camps.

== People ==
===Ethnic groups===
Muslims live in every region in China. The highest concentrations are found in the northwest provinces of Xinjiang, Gansu and Ningxia, with significant populations also found throughout Yunnan Province in Southwest China and Henan Province in Central China. Of China&#x27;s 55 officially recognized minority peoples, ten groups are predominantly Muslim. The largest groups in descending order are Hui (9.8 million in year 2000 census or 48% of the officially tabulated number of Muslims), Uyghur (8.4 million, 41%), Kazakh (1.25 million, 6.1%), Dongxiang (514,000, 2.5%), Kyrgyz (144,000), Uzbeks (125,000), Salar (105,000), Tajik (41,000), Bonan (17,000) and Tatar (5,000). However, individual members of traditionally Muslim groups may profess other religions or none at all. Additionally, Tibetan Muslims are officially classified along with the Tibetan people. Muslims live predominantly in the areas that border Central Asia, Tibet and Mongolia, i.e. Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu and Qinghai, which is known as the &quot;Quran Belt&quot;.

===Number of Muslims in China===
There are several population estimates. Counting up the number of people of traditionally Muslim nationalities who were enumerated in the 2000 census reported a total of 20.3 million members of Muslim nationalities, of which again 96% belonged to just three groups: Hui 9.8 million, Uyghurs 8.4 million, and Kazakhs 1.25 million. A 2009 study done by the Pew Research Center concluded there are 21,667,000 Muslims in China, accounting for 1.6% of the total population. According to the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, about 1.8% of the total population in China are Muslims, meaning 25 million. In 2021, &quot;NewLines Magazine&quot; estimated &quot;around 40 million people&quot;. According to the textbook, &quot;Religions in the Modern World&quot;, it states that the &quot;numbers of followers of any one tradition are difficult to estimate and must in China as everywhere else rely on statistics compiled by the largest institutions, either those of the state – which tend to underestimate – or those of the religious institutions themselves – which tend to overestimate. If we include all the population of those designated &#x27;national&#x27; minorities with an Islamic heritage in the territory of China, then we can conclude that there are some 20 million Muslims in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot;

Other nationalities that are traditionally Muslim include Kyrghyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Tatars, Salar, Bonan and Dongxiang. According to SARA there are approximately 36,000 Islamic places of worship, more than 45,000 imams, and 10 Islamic schools in the country. Within the next two decades from 2011, Pew projects a slowing down of the Muslim population growth in China compared to previous years, with Muslim women in China having a 1.7 fertility rate. Many Hui Muslims voluntarily limit themselves to one child in China since their Imams preach to them about the benefits of population control, while the number of children Hui in different areas are allowed to have varies between one and three children. Chinese family planning policy allows minorities including Muslims to have up to two children in urban areas and three to four children in rural areas.

An older estimate of the Muslim population of the then Qing Empire belongs to the Christian missionary Marshall Broomhall. In his book, published in 1910, he produced estimates for each province, based on the reports of missionaries working there, who had counted mosques, talked to mullahs, etc. Broomhall admits the inadequacy of the data for Xinjiang, estimating the Muslim population of Xinjiang (i.e., virtually the entire population of the province at the time) in the range from 1,000,000 (based on the total population number of 1,200,000 in the contemporary &quot;Statesman&#x27;s Yearbook&quot;) to 2,400,000 (2 million &quot;Turki&quot;, 200,000 &quot;Hasak&quot; and 200,000 &quot;Tungan&quot;, as per George Hunter). He uses the estimates of 2,000,000 to 3,500,000 for Gansu (which then also included today&#x27;s Ningxia and parts of Qinghai), 500,000 to 1,000,000 for Zhili (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei), 300,000 to 1,000,000 for Yunnan and smaller numbers for other provinces, down to 1,000 in Fujian. For Mongolia (then, part of the Qing Empire) he takes an arbitrary range of 50,000 to 100,000. Summing up, he arrives to the grand total of 4,727,000 to 9,821,000 Muslims throughout the Qing Empire of its last years, i.e. just over 1–2% of the entire country&#x27;s estimated population of 426,045,305. The 1920 edition of &quot;New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World&#x27;s Progress&quot; gave the number &quot;between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000&quot; as the total number of Muslims in the Republic of China.

== Islamic education ==
Hui Muslim Generals like Ma Fuxiang, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Bufang funded schools or sponsored students studying abroad. Imam Hu Songshan and Ma Linyi were involved in reforming Islamic education inside China.

Muslim Kuomintang officials in the Republic of China government supported the Chengda Teachers Academy, which helped usher in a new era of Islamic education in China, promoting nationalism and Chinese language among Muslims, and fully incorporating them into the main aspects of Chinese society. The Ministry of Education provided funds to the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Federation for Chinese Muslim&#x27;s education. The President of the federation was General Bai Chongxi (Pai Chung-hsi) and the vice president was Tang Kesan (Tang Ko-san). 40 Sino-Arabic primary schools were founded in Ningxia by its Governor Ma Hongkui.

Imam Wang Jingzhai studied at Al-Azhar University in Egypt along with several other Chinese Muslim students, the first Chinese students in modern times to study in the Middle East. Wang recalled his experience teaching at madrassas in the provinces of Henan (Yu), Hebei (Ji), and Shandong (Lu) which were outside of the traditional stronghold of Muslim education in northwest China, and where the living conditions were poorer and the students had a much tougher time than the northwestern students. In 1931 China sent five students to study at Al-Azhar in Egypt, among them was Muhammad Ma Jian and they were the first Chinese to study at Al-Azhar. Na Zhong, a descendant of Nasr al-Din (Yunnan) was another one of the students sent to Al-Azhar in 1931, along with Zhang Ziren, Ma Jian, and Lin Zhongming.

Hui Muslims from the Central Plains (Zhongyuan) differed in their view of women&#x27;s education than Hui Muslims from the northwestern provinces, with the Hui from the Central Plains provinces like Henan having a history of women&#x27;s Mosques and religious schooling for women, while Hui women in northwestern provinces were kept in the house. However, in northwestern China reformers started bringing female education in the 1920s. In Linxia, Gansu, a secular school for Hui girls was founded by the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang, the school was named Shuada Suqin Women&#x27;s Primary School after his wife Ma Suqin who was also involved in its founding. Hui Muslim refugees fled to northwest China from the central plains after the Japanese invasion of China, where they continued to practice women&#x27;s education and build women&#x27;s mosque communities, while women&#x27;s education was not adopted by the local northwestern Hui Muslims and the two different communities continued to differ in this practice.

General Ma Fuxiang donated funds to promote education for Hui Muslims and help build a class of intellectuals among the Hui and promote the Hui role in developing the nation&#x27;s strength.

==Sectarian tensions==
===Hui-Uyghur tension===
Tensions between Hui Muslims and Uyghurs arise because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs in the past, and crushed the Uyghurs&#x27; revolts. Xinjiang&#x27;s Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Many Hui Muslim civilians were killed by Uyghur rebellion troops in 1933 known as the Kizil massacre. During the 2009 rioting in Xinjiang that killed around 200 people, &quot;Kill the Han, kill the Hui.&quot; is a common cry spread across social media among Uyghur extremists. Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar (1934) massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries. Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques.

The Uyghur militant organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement&#x27;s magazine &quot;Islamic Turkistan&quot; has accused the Chinese &quot;Muslim Brotherhood&quot; (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the &quot;infidel Chinese&quot; language is the language of the Hui.

=== Hui sects ===
There have been many occurrences of violent sectarian fighting between different Hui sects. Sectarian fighting between Hui sects led to the Jahriyya rebellion in the 1780s and the 1895 revolt. After a hiatus after the People&#x27;s Republic of China came to power, sectarian in fighting resumed in the 1990s in Ningxia between different sects. Several sects refuse to intermarry with each other. One Sufi sect circulated an anti-Salafi pamphlet in Arabic.

===Tibetan Muslims===
In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang&#x27;s rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917–49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking Kache minority of Muslims).

The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars alike ignore this and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.

== Religious practices ==
===Islamic education in China===

In the two decades up to 2006, a wide range of Islamic educational opportunities were developed to meet the needs of China&#x27;s Muslim population. In addition to mosque schools, government Islamic colleges and independent Islamic colleges, more students went overseas to continue their studies at international Islamic universities in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, Pakistan and Malaysia. () is the Chinese term for certain Islamic institutions. Its literal meaning is .

===Muslim groups===
The vast majority of China&#x27;s Muslims are Sunni Muslims. A notable feature of some Muslim communities in China is the presence of female imams. Islamic scholar Ma Tong recorded that the 6,781,500 Hui in China predominately followed the Orthodox form of Islam (58.2% were Gedimu, a non-Sufi mainstream tradition that opposed unorthodoxy and religious innovation), mainly adhering to the Hanafi Maturidi Madhhab. However a large minority of Hui are members of Sufi groups. According to Tong, 21% Yihewani, 10.9% Jahriyya, 7.2% Khuffiya, 1.4% Qadariyya and 0.7% Kubrawiyya. Shia Chinese Muslims are mostly Ismailis, including Tajiks of the Tashkurgan and Sarikul areas of Xinjiang.

===Chinese Muslims and the Hajj===

It is known that Admiral Zheng He (1371–1435) and his Muslim crews had made the journey to Mecca and performed the Hajj during one of the former&#x27;s voyages to the western ocean between 1401 and 1433. Other Chinese Muslims may have made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in the following centuries; however, there is little information on this. General Ma Lin made a Hajj to Mecca. General Ma Fuxiang along with Ma Linyi sponsored Imam Wang Jingzhai when he went on hajj to Mecca in 1921. Yihewani Imam Hu Songshan went on Hajj in 1925.

Briefly during the Cultural Revolution, Chinese Muslims were not allowed to attend the Hajj and only did so through Pakistan, but this policy was reversed in 1979. Chinese Muslims now attend the Hajj in large numbers, typically in organized groups of roughly 10,000 each year, with a record 10,700 Chinese Muslim pilgrims from all over the country making the Hajj in 2007. Over 11,000 from Xinjiang reportedly went to the Hajj in 2019.

== Representative bodies ==
===Islamic Association of China===
Established by the government, the Islamic Association of China claims to represent Chinese Muslims nationwide. At its inaugural meeting on May 11, 1953, in Beijing, representatives from 10 nationalities of the People&#x27;s Republic of China were in attendance. The association was to be run by 16 Islamic religious leaders charged with making &quot;a correct and authoritative interpretation&quot; of Islamic creed and canon. Its brief is to compile and spread inspirational speeches and help imams &quot;improve&quot; themselves, and vet sermons made by clerics around the country.

Some examples of the religious concessions granted to Muslims are:
* Muslim communities are allowed separate cemeteries
* Muslim couples may have their marriage consecrated by an Imam
* Muslim workers are permitted holidays during major religious festivals
* Chinese Muslims are also allowed to make the Hajj to Mecca, and more than 45,000 Chinese Muslims have done so in recent years.

== Culture and heritage ==
Although contacts and previous conquests have occurred before, the Mongol conquest of the greater part of Eurasia in the 13th century permanently brought the extensive cultural traditions of China, central Asia and western Asia into a single empire, albeit one of separate khanates, for the first time in history. The intimate interaction that resulted is evident in the legacy of both traditions. In China, Islam influenced technology, sciences, philosophy and the arts. For example, the Chinese adopted much Islamic medical knowledge such as wound healing and urinalysis. However, the Chinese were not the only ones to benefit from the cultural exchanges of the Silk Road. Islam showed many influences from buddhist China in their new techniques in art, especially when humans began to be depicted in paintings which was thought to be forbidden in Islam. In terms of material culture, one finds decorative motifs from central Asian Islamic architecture and calligraphy and the marked halal impact on northern Chinese cuisine.

Taking the Mongol Eurasian empire as a point of departure, the ethnogenesis of the Hui, or Sinophone Muslims, can also be charted through the emergence of distinctly Chinese Muslim traditions in architecture, food, epigraphy and Islamic written culture. This multifaceted cultural heritage continues to the present day.

===Military===
Muslims have often filled military positions, and many Muslims have joined the Chinese army. Muslims served extensively in the Chinese military, as both officials and soldiers. It was said that the Muslim Dongxiang and Salar were given to &quot;eating rations&quot;, a reference to military service.

===Islamic architecture in China===

In Chinese, a mosque is called &quot;qīngzhēn sì&quot; (清真寺) or &quot;pure truth temple&quot;. The Huaisheng Mosque and Great Mosque of Xi&#x27;an (first established during the Tang era) and the Great Southern Mosque in Jinan, whose current buildings date from the Ming dynasty, do not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, they follow traditional Chinese architecture. Mosques in western China incorporate more of the elements seen in mosques in other parts of the world. Western Chinese mosques were more likely to incorporate minarets and domes while eastern Chinese mosques were more likely to look like pagodas.
An important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on symmetry, which connotes a sense of grandeur; this applies to everything from palaces to mosques. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden&#x27;s composition is to create enduring flow; to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself. The Qingjing Mosque was built in 1009.

On the foothills of Mount Lingshan are the tombs of two of the four companions that Muhammad sent eastwards to preach Islam. Known as the &quot;Holy Tombs&quot;, they house the companions Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun—their Chinese names, of course. The other two companions went to Guangzhou and Yangzhou.

As in all regions the Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture resembling temples in its style. However, in western China the mosques resemble those of the middle east, with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs. In northwest China where the Chinese Hui have built their mosques, there is a combination of east and west. The mosques have flared Chinese-style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and minarets. The first mosque was the Great Mosque of Xian or the Xian Mosque, which was created in the Tang dynasty in the 7th century. In July 2019, Indonesian Islamic scholar Said Aqil Siradj said that Chinese authorities including those in Xinjiang were building and repairing mosques along with creating hundreds of halal restaurants.

Ningxia officials notified on 3 August 2018 that the Weizhou Grand Mosque will be forcibly demolished on Friday because it had not received the proper permits before construction. Officials in the town were saying the mosque had not been given proper building permits, because it is built in a Middle Eastern style and include numerous domes and minarets. The residents of Weizhou alarmed each other by social media and finally stopped the mosque destruction by public demonstrations. According to a September 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, since 2017, Chinese authorities have destroyed or damaged 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang – 65% of the region&#x27;s total.

===Halal food in China===

Halal food has a long history in China. The arrival of Arabian and Persian merchants during the Tang and Song dynasties saw the introduction of the Muslim diet. Chinese Muslim cuisine adheres strictly to the Islamic dietary rules with mutton and lamb being the predominant ingredient. The advantage of Muslim cuisine in China is that it has inherited the diverse cooking methods of Chinese cuisine for example, braising, roasting, steaming, stewing and many more. Due to China&#x27;s multicultural background Muslim cuisine retains its own style and characteristics according to regions. Restaurants serving such cuisine are frequented by both Muslim and Han Chinese customers.

Due to the large Muslim population in Western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to Muslims or the general public but are run by Muslims. In most major cities in China, there are small Islamic restaurants or food stalls typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., Uyghurs), which offer inexpensive noodle soup. Lamb and mutton dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. Commercially prepared food can be certified Halal by approved agencies. In Chinese, halal is called &quot;qīngzhēncài&quot; (清真菜) or &quot;pure truth food&quot;. Beef and lamb slaughtered according to Islamic rituals is also commonly available in public markets, especially in North China. Such meat is sold by Muslim butchers, who operate independent stalls next to non-Muslim butchers.

In October 2018, the government launched an official anti-halal policy, urging officials to suppress the &quot;pan-halal tendency&quot;, seen as an encroachment by religion into secular life and a source of religious extremism.

===Calligraphy===
====Sini====


Sini is a Chinese Islamic calligraphic form for the Arabic script. It can refer to any type of Chinese Islamic calligraphy, but is commonly used to refer to one with thick and tapered effects, much like Chinese calligraphy. It is used extensively in mosques in Eastern China and to a lesser extent in Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. A famous Sini calligrapher is Hajji Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang.

====Xiao&#x27;erjing====


Xiao&#x27;erjing (also Xiao&#x27;erjin or Xiaojing) is the practice of writing Sinitic languages such as Mandarin (especially the Lanyin, Zhongyuan and Northeastern dialects) or the Dungan language in the Arabic script. It is used on occasion by many ethnic minorities who adhere to the Islamic faith in China (mostly the Hui, but also the Dongxiang and the Salar) and formerly by their Dungan descendants in Central Asia.

===Martial arts===
There is a long history of Muslim development and participation at the highest level of Chinese &quot;wushu&quot;. The Hui started and adapted many of the styles of &quot;wushu&quot; such as &quot;bajiquan&quot;, &quot;piguazhang&quot; and &quot;liuhequan&quot;. There were specific areas that were known to be centers of Muslim &quot;wushu&quot;, such as Cang County in Hebei Province. These traditional Hui martial arts were very distinct from the Turkic styles practiced in Xinjiang.

===Literature===
The Han Kitab was a collection of Chinese Islamic texts written by Chinese Muslim which synthesized Islam and Confucianism. It was written in the early 18th century during the Qing dynasty. Han is Chinese for Chinese and kitab (ketabu in Chinese) is Arabic for book. Liu Zhi wrote his Han Kitab in Nanjing in the early 18th century. The works of Wu Sunqie, Zhang Zhong and Wang Daiyu were also included in the Han Kitab.

The Han Kitab was widely read and approved of by later Chinese Muslims such as Ma Qixi, Ma Fuxiang and Hu Songshan. They believed that Islam could be understood through Confucianism.

===Education===
A lot of Chinese students including male and females join International Islamic University, Islamabad to gain Islamic knowledge. For some Muslim groups in China, such as the Hui and Salar minorities, coeducation is frowned upon; for some groups such as Uyghurs, it is not.

===Women imams===
With the exception of China, the world has very few mosques directed by women. Among the Hui, women are allowed to become imams or &quot;ahong&quot;, and a number of woman-only mosques have been established. The tradition evolved from earlier Quranic schools for girls, with the oldest, the Wangjia Hutong Women&#x27;s Mosque in Kaifeng, dating to 1820.

<text>Windward Passage (; ) is a strait in the Caribbean Sea, between the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. The strait specifically lies between the easternmost region of Cuba and the northwest of Haiti. wide, the Windward Passage has a threshold depth of .

With Navassa Island on its southern approach, it connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea, and is in the direct path of shipping between the Panama Canal and the eastern seaboard of the United States. From either the eastern tip of the Guantánamo Province of Cuba, or the western tip of Haiti&#x27;s Nord-Ouest Department, it is possible to see lights on the other side of the Windward Passage.

==Territorial dispute==
For decades, Cuba and Haiti had disputes over where the maritime boundary between the two nations was. In 1977, they settled by signing the Cuba–Haiti Maritime Boundary Agreement setting the official boundary.

==Geology==
The Septentrional-Oriente fault zone passes through the Windward Passage from the southern coast of Cuba to the northern coast of Hispaniola. During the Holocene the slip rate between these two islands was /year. The Septentrional Fault extends east at least to the still active Mona Rift in the Mona Passage, where extension occurs between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. The last rupture of this fault occurred in 1842; the resulting earthquake and tsunami devastated Cap Haitien. Considerable seismic hazard continues to exist on this fault:

The Windward Passage region was studied in detail by a voyage of the EV &quot;Nautilus&quot; in August 2014, assisted by the ROV &quot;Hercules&quot;. This expedition provided measurements of water circulation through the straight, as well as observations of animal life on the deep continental shelf.

<doc id="705412" wikidata="Q1476554" url="?curid=705412" title="Roland MC-303">
<text>The Roland MC-303 is the first of a series of musical instruments known as a groovebox. It combines a simple sound module with a sequencer to record and store notation, along with controls aimed at encouraging the musician to improvise the music while it is playing. Despite the number in its name and the attention it received at its launch, the MC-303 has more in common with other MC prefixed synthesizers (such as the Roland MC-202), which contain built-in sequencers, than it does with the famous Roland TB-303. As the first Groovebox, the MC-303 was the first in a line of inexpensive products specifically targeted towards house DJs and amateur home musicians rather than professional producers. It was superseded by the Roland MC-505. It is the predecessor to the Roland JX-305, Roland D2, Roland MC-307, Roland EG-101, Roland MC-09, Roland MC-909, Roland MC-808, and most recently the Roland MC-707 in 2019, along with its more portable sibling, the Roland MC-101.

==Features==

The key features of the MC-303 are:

* Sound generator with 28 note - voice polyphony based on the structure model of Roland JV-80 synthesizer
* 8-track sequencer containing multiple quantize functions: Grid, Shuffle, and Groove. (7 pitched instruments and 1 drum kit) 
* 16-part multitimbral
* 448 sounds and 12 drum kits (includes the Roland CR-78, TR-808, TR-606 &amp; TR-909, electro, techno, jungle, house, drum &amp; bass, breakbeat), 40 synth basses (TB-303, etc.), 35 synth leads, 33 synth pads
* Resonant filter, LFO, envelope control and built-in effects: delay, reverb, flanger and chorus
* Realtime Phrase Sequencer (RPS) for instant recall of musical phrases
* Low Boost Knob feature (Back panel, Only on the Roland MC-303): allowing you to dial in as much low-end as it takes to create powerful Kick or TR-808 Bass sounds so that anyone can &#x27;feel&#x27; the groove.
* 300 onboard dance music variation patterns such as drumbeats and basslines
* Recording length of up to 32 bars per pattern
* Instant storage of up to 50 user patterns, 300 pattern variations and 10 songs
* Storage space for up to approximately 14,000 notes
* MIDI in and out connections (but no MIDI thru)

==Synthesizer/Sound Module==

The synthesizer built into the Roland MC-303 is a rompler which contains sounds largely drawn from classic Roland synths and drum machines such as the TB-303, TR-808 and TR-909 along with the Juno series and various other dance themed sounds such as pads, pianos, strings and vinyl scratches. The sounds can be manipulated with a low-pass filter, various modulation capabilities and some simple DSP effects. It doesn&#x27;t have a sampler, although the instruction book contains instructions for getting it to control an external sampler.

==Sequencer==

The most important part of the MC-303 is its built-in pattern based 8 track sequencer. Each pattern can contain up to 32 bars. It can record and send MIDI data via the MIDI jacks on the rear panel, enabling its internal sequencer to control other sound modules, or its internal sound module to be controlled by an external sequencer. Although communication with other devices is possible, the main advantage to the MC-303 with its small form factor and all-in-one design is the ability to use it as a self-contained studio, albeit an amateur one. Featuring a micro-keyboard that can also be used as a drum sequencer, the MC-303 imitates the handling as well as the look and feel of other famous Roland synthesizers and drum machines such as the MC-202, TB-303, TR-808 and TR-909.

==Criticisms==

One criticism made of the machine in various reviews, including the August 1996 issue of Sound on Sound magazine, was that the sound module was essentially limited to only playing built-in preset sounds, discouraging innovation. From a more technical perspective, a major concern was that any knob tweaks made during real time recording were not transmitted via MIDI. The number of preset patterns (mostly aimed for Trance and Techno music) outweighed the number of programmable user patterns which also discouraged innovation. Roland responded in part to these criticisms in its later grooveboxes by solving the MIDI problem, increasing the synthesis capabilities and user pattern storage and adding a sampler section.

<doc id="705414" wikidata="Q781911" url="?curid=705414" title="Ja'far Pishevari">
<text>Sayyed Ja&#x27;far Pishevari (; ; ; 26 August 1892 – 11 June 1947) was an Iranian Azerbaijani communist politician who most-notably founded and led the Azerbaijani Democratic Party, the founding and ruling party of the Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government.

==Life==
He was born in Khalkhal in Ardabil province, Iran. He had lived in the Caucasus in the early 20th century and was introduced to Marxism during this period. He was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.

He was a founding member of the Communist Party of Iran (not to be confused with the Tudeh Party), established in 1920, in Rasht. He became a journalist and communist activist in the 1920s.

In 1921, Pishevari served the Soviets as minister of the interior in the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic.

He was arrested and imprisoned during nine years in the late 1930s and early 1940s by the government of Reza Shah Pahlavi for his communist ideas and activities. He was released from prison after Reza Shah was deposed by the Allies in 1941. Pishevari was the Tudeh Party of Iran candidate for the Majlis and was elected, but was denied entry by the rest of deputies. Of the 100 votes cast, his credentials were rejected 47–50.

He then established the Azerbaijani Democratic Party with manifest material and organizational support from the USSR.

==Political career==

The Soviet Union founded the communist Azerbaijan People&#x27;s Government in November 1945 during their occupation of Northern Iran, making Pishevari its leader. It seems however that the strong man of this government was Mohammed Biriya, Minister of Propaganda and head of secret police trained by the NKVD. His government&#x27;s actions, including organizing and arming local militias, disarming of regular Iranian military and police forces, setting up an independent judiciary based on the Soviet legal system, nationalising banks, levying taxes, land reform without ratification of the Majlis, using Azerbaijani as the official language and banning the usage of Persian, and setting up an alternative curriculum and educational system, were viewed with deep suspicion by the central government and other Iranians.

Following an agreement reached between the governments of Iran and the USSR under intense American pressure, who viewed Pishevari&#x27;s government as a not-too-subtle scheme by the USSR to partition Iran, the Soviets removed their protection. Iranian armed forces, kept away from the provinces of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan by the Red Army presence since 1942, entered these provinces in November 1946. Pishevari&#x27;s self-proclaimed government collapsed quickly, as many of the people welcomed the central government&#x27;s troops. By December 1946, both Azerbaijan and Kurdistan were evacuated by the Soviet forces and the Iranian government re-established control over the USSR-occupied territories. It appeared as if Pishevari&#x27;s government was becoming very unpopular, especially in larger cities where the merchants feared communism.

After the collapse of this short-lived republic, he fled to Azerbaijan SSR and died in a car crash in Baku in 1947. 

== Legacy ==
His legacy is a matter of heated debate today. While many Iranians consider him as either a Soviet stooge or a traitor, he is considered a national hero for Azeri nationalists or a socialist revolutionary by the Iranian Left. He had the support of Joseph Stalin and the USSR in setting up his government. There is also no doubt that USSR indeed wanted to annex several provinces in northern Iran.

<text>Maxwell Washburn Long (October 16, 1878 – March 4, 1959) was an American athlete, winner of 400 m at the 1900 Summer Olympics.

== Biography ==
Long won three AAU titles from 1898 to 1900 and IC4A title in 1899 in 440 yd (402 m), 1899 an AAU title in 220 yd (201 m) and 1900 an AAU title in 100 yd (91 m). He also won the British AAA Championships title at the 1900 AAA Championships.

Maxie Long from Columbia University, was one of the top favorites for the Olympic title in Paris and at the 1900 Summer Olympics, Long led the 400 metres race from start to finish, beating his teammate William Holland at 3 yards (2.7 m). 

Later in this year, Long ran some brilliant records. On September 29 he ran 47.8 for 440 yd (402 m) and a few days later even 47.0, but the latter was on a straight track. In 1901 he finished second behind reginald Wadsley in the 440 yards event at the 1901 AAA Championships.

In 2021 he was elected into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

<text>The Eternals are a fictional race of humanoids appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They were created by Jack Kirby, making their first appearance in &quot;The Eternals&quot; #1 (July 1976).

In the Marvel Universe, the Eternals are an offshoot of humanity known as Homo immortalis which were created one million years ago by the enigmatic alien Celestials to defend Earth with their superhuman powers and abilities. Their primary adversaries are the Deviants, who share a similar origin and pose a regular threat to humanity. Due to their virtual immortality, Eternals have largely secluded themselves from humans, with their god-like status forming the basis of various mythological figures around the world.

Since their appearance, the Eternals have had several of their own series, in addition to crossing into other titles, such as &quot;Thor&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;. They made their debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with their own feature film &quot;Eternals&quot;, directed by Chloé Zhao, which was released November 5, 2021.

==Publication history==
In 1970, Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics to work at DC Comics, where he began the saga of the New Gods, an epic story involving mythological and science fiction concepts. Though he had planned for a definitive ending, the series was abruptly cancelled. Upon his return to Marvel, Kirby continued exploring his interest in mythological science fiction through &quot;The Eternals&quot;.

Originally titled &quot;The Celestials&quot;, Marvel changed the title to &quot;Return of the Gods&quot;, whose comic book cover bore stylistics similarities to Erich von Daniken&#x27;s book &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot;. To avoid potential legal issues, the name was again changed to “Eternals&quot;. The Eternals&#x27; saga was thematically similar to the New Gods&#x27; and it shared the same fate: Kirby’s new series also was eventually canceled without resolving many of its plots. Writers Roy Thomas and Mark Gruenwald used the Eternals in a &quot;Thor&quot; storyline that concluded in &quot;Thor&quot; #301, resolving those lingering plotlines. Subsequent to the &quot;Thor&quot; storyline, the Eternals (and the mythology connected to them) have appeared or been mentioned in numerous Marvel comics. In particular, the Celestials&#x27; experiment on humanity has been used to explain how certain humans can develop super-powers. The Titanians (created by Jim Starlin) and Uranians (created by Stan Lee) were later retconned as being Eternals as well.

&quot;The Eternals&quot; returned for a 12-issue miniseries in 1985 under writer Peter B. Gillis and penciler Sal Buscema. According to comic-book historian Peter Sanderson, &quot;editor in chief Jim Shooter disliked Gillis’s scripts, so Walter Simonson wrote the final four issues.&quot;

In 2000, a one-shot comic called &quot;New Eternals: Apocalypse Now&quot; #1 featured an older conflict between the Eternals and X-Men villain Apocalypse. In 2003, writer Chuck Austen and artist Kev Walker rebooted the franchise for Marvel&#x27;s mature readers-focused MAX imprint, resulting in &quot;The Eternal&quot;.

&quot;The Eternal&quot; series from Marvel&#x27;s MAX imprint written by Chuck Austen was based on an idea he had been working on for a while: &quot;I pitched this back when I first started working at Marvel, but Joe Quesada was against doing it. He saw no future in this particular old Kirby concept.&quot; Austen described the plot as involving &quot;Ikaeden, the leader of the Eternals, who arrives on Earth at the dawn of man, and evolves humankind from homo-erectus so he can use them as slaves to mine raw materials for the Celestials, his bosses, basically,&quot; as well as &quot;Kurassus, who is the second-in-command of the mining mission, and who is determined to undermine Ikaeden and kill Ikaeden&#x27;s precious slave-girl and son.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Newsarama&quot; he gave an outline of his planned plot:

Planned as an ongoing series, it was cancelled after six issues.

Neil Gaiman, with artist John Romita, Jr., created a 2006 miniseries, which helped bring the Eternals&#x27; role in the modern Marvel Universe up-to-date. Solicited as a six-issue series, an extra issue was added to the run, because, according to editor Nick Lowe, &quot;There was too much story to fit into the structure we set for ourselves. Neil was starting issue five and told me that he might need a seventh issue. He just had too much story to fit in six issues (even with the first and sixth double-sized).&quot;

A fourth &quot;Eternals&quot; series ran as an ongoing series for nine issues and one annual from August 2008 – March 2009.

The Eternals returned in Jason Aaron&#x27;s &quot;Avengers&quot;, a story arc involving the Dark Celestials, which saw the Eternals all killed in the fourth issue. However, the characters were resurrected in their new ongoing series launched in January 2021 by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Esad Ribić.

==Fictional history==
When the Celestials visited Earth 1,000,000 years ago and performed genetic experiments on early proto-humans, they created two divergent races: the long-lived Eternals, and the genetically unstable and monstrously grotesque Deviants. These experiments also led to the capacity for super-powered mutations in humans. They also performed this experiment on other planets (such as the Kree and Skrull homeworlds) with similar results.

Despite looking human, Eternals are much longer-lived (but were not originally fully immortal), and that kept them from having much contact with their human cousins. Eternals have a low birth rate; they can interbreed with humans but the result is always a normal human (although Thena&#x27;s son, Joey Athena seems to have become an Eternal with long-lived properties and powers). Despite this, the Eternals have in general protected the human race, especially from the Deviants, with whom they have always had an enmity. The Eternals also developed advanced technology.

Long ago, a civil war broke out amongst the Eternals over whether to conquer the other races, with one faction led by Kronos and the other by his warlike brother, Uranos. Kronos&#x27;s side prevailed, and Uranos and his defeated faction left Earth and journeyed to Uranus where they built a colony. Some of Uranos&#x27;s group soon tried to return to Earth to re-kindle the war, but they were attacked by a passing Kree ship and forced to land on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. There they built another colony (experiments performed by Kree scientists on a captured Eternal led them to go to Earth and perform their genetic experiments on a group of humans, thus creating the Inhumans).
One day, Kronos&#x27;s experiments in cosmic energy caused a catastrophic release of energy throughout the Eternals&#x27; city, Titanos, destroying it, activating latent genes in the Eternals, and disintegrating the scientist&#x27;s body. The Eternals now found they could channel large quantities of cosmic energy themselves, granting them near-godlike power. The accident left Kronos in an immaterial state, so a new leader had to be chosen. For the first time, the Eternals merged into a single being, the Uni-Mind, to decide which of Kronos&#x27;s sons, Zuras or A&#x27;lars should be the new leader. Zuras was chosen to be the Prime Eternal, and A&#x27;lars chose to leave Earth to avoid causing another civil war and journeyed to Titan.

There he found that a war (allegedly caused by the Dragon of the Moon) had erupted on Titan and wiped out all but one member, a woman named Sui-San. A&#x27;lars fell in love with her, and in time they repopulated Titan. Due to the mix of activated genes from A&#x27;lars and unactivated ones from Sui-San, these new Titanian Eternals are not as powerful or immortal as Terran Eternals, but are more powerful and longer-lived than the earlier pre-civil war Titanian Eternals.

While Zuras ruled, three new Eternal cities were built. The first was Olympia, located in the mountains of Greece, near the main portal between the Earth dimension and the Olympians&#x27; home dimension, which led many ancient Greeks to confuse some of the godlike Eternals with members of the Olympian pantheon. Eventually, an agreement was reached with the gods where some Eternals, such as Thena, would impersonate the Olympians before their worshipers. The other two Eternal cities were Polaria (located in Siberia) and Oceana (in the Pacific).

18,000 years ago, the Celestials returned to Earth. The Deviants attacked them, but the Celestials counterattacked, resulting in the sinking of Mu and Atlantis, and much worldwide havoc. The Eternals helped rescue many humans. An Eternal named Valkin was entrusted by the Celestials with an artifact of great power for safekeeping.

At some point during the early centuries, Ikaris and the Eternals came into conflict with the immortal mutant, Apocalypse. This conflict ended when Ikaris and the Eternals defeated him. Ikaris believed Apocalypse was dead.

1,000 years ago, the Asgardian god Thor encountered some Eternals, but the encounter was erased from his mind, to prevent him from learning about the Celestials, who were about to return to Earth. An Eternal named Ajak became the Celestials&#x27; spokesperson, and put himself to sleep when the Celestials left, to wait for their return 1,000 years later to judge humanity.

During the early 20th century, a human scientist made contact with the Uranian Eternals and was taken to live with them along with his young son, who would later become Marvel Boy. The Uranians were eventually killed by Deathurge. After World War II, some Eternals allied with humans and Deviants to form the Damocles Foundation, which tried to create a new breed of superhuman to rule Earth. Some Eternals, such as Makkari, were also active as superheroes, or living amongst humans, keeping their true nature hidden. The Eternals also helped to move the Inhumans&#x27; city to the Himalayas to keep it hidden.

At some point, Thanos of the Eternals of Titan nearly destroyed their colony, but they rebuilt it, and would help Earth&#x27;s heroes to oppose him on several occasions.

===Modern Age===
In recent times, Ikaris met the archaeologist Daniel Damian and his daughter Margo, and accompanied them into an old Eternal city in the Andes, where he awakened Ajak. Ajak began the process to receive the Celestials. These movements alerted the Deviants, who decided to attack New York and to provoke fear in the humans against the coming celestials. When the Celestials returned to judge the worthiness of their creations a few years ago, the Eternals found themselves clashing with the Deviants again, and decided to publicly reveal their existence to humanity. Zuras feared what would happen if the Celestials judged unfavorably. They encountered Thor again, and were attacked by Thor&#x27;s father Odin and the Olympian gods, who tried to prevent their interfering with the gods&#x27; plans to attack the Celestials. Eventually, the Eternals decided to help the gods and formed a Uni-Mind to assist the Destroyer&#x27;s assault on the Celestials.

They were forced to dissolve back into Eternals by the Celestials, and the shock of the attack killed Zuras. Before his spirit fully left the material plane, he instructed his daughter Thena to take his people to explore space. Since then, the Eternals have helped Earth&#x27;s heroes, particularly the Avengers, against several menaces. They also discovered the existence of the Titanian Eternals.

Some time later, the Deviant&#x27;s aristocracy, led by Brother Tode, attacked Olympia, kidnapping the Eternals and intending to disintegrate them. The hero Iron Man (James Rhodes) rescued the Eternals and helped them defeat the deviants. Then the Eternals transformed the deviant&#x27;s aristocracy into a synthetic cube, killing them. The Eternals formed a Uni-Mind to discuss their future on earth, after which most of the Eternals (led by Valkin), went to the stars. But a handful – those most heavily involved in Earthly affairs – remained behind on Earth. Thena came to lead the remaining Eternals but she wasn&#x27;t very respected by her subjects.

With the ascension of Priestlord Ghaur as leader of the Deviants, the Eternals joined the Avengers in defeating him after he absorbed the power of a Celestial and tried to gain godhood. Meanwhile, Ikaris questioned Thena for her poor choices as leader of the Eternals. She was subtly being controlled by a brain mine put in her by Kro. After a special ceremony, Ikaris succeeded her as leader of the Earth&#x27;s Eternals. The lover of Ikaris, Margo Damian, was captured by Ghaur&#x27;s minions and was killed as a result of a Deviant experiment on her.

After the death of his daughter, Daniel Damian decided to take revenge against the Deviants and the Eternals. With the help of ancient Eternal machines, he forged a prophecy to incite war between the two races and transformed Ajak in a murderous monster. When his plan was discovered by the Eternals, Ajak reverted to his original form and regretted the killings that he had committed, so he killed Damian and himself.

The Eternals Gilgamesh and Sersi briefly became part of the Superhero team Avengers. When Sersi became sick with the &quot;Mahd Wy&#x27;ry&quot; disease, a uncurable degenerating Eternal disease, Ikaris and other Eternals tried to bring her to Olympia and perform a rite of Cleansing. Sersi rejected the idea, on the basis that the ritual was designed to kill the infected Eternal, and solicited his family to perform the &quot;Gann Josin&quot; bond between her and her lover the Black Knight. Ikaris was furious and performed the bond without consent of the Knight. Later Thena and other Eternals helped the Avengers in the battle against the Gatherers and Proctor, who was an alternate Black Knight and who infected Sersi with the &quot;Mahd Wy&#x27;ry&quot; disease for spite.

The Eternals fought once more against Ghaur and the Deviants, with the help of the Heroes for Hire. The mad priest tried to form an &quot;Anti-Mind&quot; with some captured eternals, to defeat any invasion of the Celestials. Later they were at odds with Apocalypse and briefly posed as a superhero team called &quot;the New Breed&quot;.

===Memory loss and the Dreaming Celestial===
The Eternals began reappearing on Earth in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s new take on the immortal beings. Most seemed to have no memory of their own history and abilities, except Ikaris, and few records of their previous appearances remain. The Eternal known as Sprite, angered at having to remain an eleven-year-old and unable to grow any further, managed to change reality, inducing collective amnesia in the Eternals as well as distorting their perceptions of history. He used a Uni-Mind with the Dreaming Celestial and other unwilling eternals to achieve his desire, transforming himself in a mortal 11 years old kid. This can possibly be seen as Gaiman&#x27;s attempt to retcon some details of the characters; early stories as well as officially published statistics portrayed most of the current generation of Eternals – such as Ikaris and Thena – as being &quot;only&quot; several tens of thousands of years old but Gaiman&#x27;s run describes them as being closer to a million years old.

Makkari was working as a medicine intern, Sersi was planning to kickstart her party planner business. Meanwhile, Thena was working as a weapons scientist in Stark Industries. She was also married and had a young son. Druig was apparently alive again and he was the Deputy minister of Vorozheika (a fictional post-soviet country). Ikaris contacted Makkari, but he did not believe the eternal&#x27;s words about the past and rejected him. Then, Makkari met Sersi again, become attracted to her and accompanied her to a party that she was organizing for Druig of Vorozheika. Thena assisted too. In the party, the amnesic Eternals are attacked by mercenaries of another faction of Vorozheika government. The reunion of the four Eternals triggered a recovery of their powers. Ikaris was captured by two deviants and they were experimenting in ways of destroy his body, until that they seemingly killed him with a particle accelerator. However, Ikaris was resurrected by a special machine in the Antarctic base of the Eternals. With their returned powers, Druig took control of Vorozheika. Thena frees herself from the mercenaries that captured her and Makkari went to talk to Sprite, who now was a young celebrity. Sprite trapped the amnesic Eternal and told him his plans and the reasons why he did the reality changes.
It was uncovered that Ajak had been revived too and that it had been he who contracted the two Deviants. He succeeded in awakening an amnesic Zuras. The two Deviants managed to kidnap Sprite, and the trapped Makkari, using him to awaken the Dreaming Celestial, who was under Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Upon awakening, the Celestial decided to judge humanity. The Eternals, now remembering their past, arrived in San Francisco, and realizing that they cannot stop the Celestial, decided to leave him be. Makkari was transformed by the Celestial into his spokesman. The Deviants called him &quot;Skadrach&quot;, and respected him, because the Dreaming Celestial was adored as their god. Sprite was killed by Zuras because of his actions and the rest of the Eternals then embarked on a quest to find and recruit the other members who had similarly forgotten their true selves due to Sprite&#x27;s trickery.

The Dreaming Celestial told Makkari the reasons for the creation of the Eternals and Deviants, and helped him to find more Eternals. Ajak, jealous of Makkari&#x27;s new function, manipulated Gilgamesh into killing Makkari. With help of Sersi, Makkari was reborn and the Dreaming Celestial stopped a planned autodestruction. Then the Eternals stopped the invasion of the Horde.

With their numbers completed, and with the new information given by the Dreaming Celestial, the Eternals debated what to do with mankind and the Deviants—leave them alone, protect them or rule them. They formed another Unimind to decide what to do and decided to hold themselves apart from the mortal world.

===The Final Host===
When Celestials literally began &quot;raining&quot; down on Earth, the Avengers are forced to reunite again and just in time to see the arrival of the Final Host which is composed of Dark Celestials that are each physically unique and were the ones who easily took down their brethren. In an attempt to learn more about these new breed of Celestials, Iron Man and Doctor Strange travelled to the Mountains of Greece to try to get some answers from The Eternals. When Stark and Strange arrived, there were no signs of life to be found as almost all of the Eternals were dead, with Strange deducing that the wounds were self-inflicted. Only Ikaris was left barely alive and reveals that the Eternals were never meant to protect Humanity as they thought. Instead, because the Celestials saw the human population as a useful pathogen to act as antibodies against the Horde, the Eternals were created to defend the process under the false impression that they were actually protecting the human race. This discovery drove all Eternals mad which either made them turn against each other or commit suicide. Ikaris is also able to reveal that the only way to prevent the Final Host from unleashing the Horde is the Uni-Mind and sends a message into Stark&#x27;s mind before dying.

===Resurrection and their confrontation with Thanos===
===A.X.E.: Judgment Day===
==Powers and abilities==
Due to the cosmic energy that suffuses an Eternal&#x27;s body and the unbreakable mental hold they have over their physiological processes, the Eternals of Earth are effectively immortal. They live for millennia, do not fatigue from physical exertion, are immune to disease and poison, and are unaffected by environmental extremes of cold and heat. Most cannot be injured by conventional weaponry, and even if they somehow are, an Eternal can rapidly regenerate any damage as long as they are able to retain their mental hold over their bodies; this mental bond can be broken. In the 2006 series it was also stated that Eternals are able to absorb oxygen directly from water, and therefore cannot drown. In the same series, Ikaris was plunged into molten metal and experienced great pain, but no physical injury, which the Deviants attributed to a forcefield which protects Ikaris even when unconscious. It is unclear if all Eternals share this degree of protection.

At one time, the official limit to the Eternals&#x27; durability was such that they could only be permanently destroyed by dispersing their bodies&#x27; molecules over a wide area.
This degree of extreme durability was revealed to have increased to a much greater degree; as demonstrated in the 2006 &quot;Eternals&quot; limited series, it is shown that even total molecular dispersal is insufficient to destroy an Eternal. As long as &quot;The Machine&quot; (a restoration device of Celestial origin; possibly the Earth itself) keeps running, any destroyed Eternal will eventually return, as was the case with Ikaris after he was completely vaporized by a particle accelerator as part of a series of &quot;experiments&quot; performed upon him by the Deviants.

This same cosmic energy can be channeled for a number of superhuman abilities, including superhuman physical abilities, immortality, flight, energy projection, mind control, teleportation, illusion creation, and elemental transmutation. In addition, groups of Eternals, as few as three at a time, can transform into the Uni-Mind, a gestalt psychic entity.

Some Eternals choose to focus on a particular power to increase their effectiveness with it. Sersi, for example, has developed the power of transmutation further than any other Eternal. Additionally, some Eternals choose to focus their cosmic energies into other, non-standard abilities. Ikaris, for example, channels cosmic energy to greatly enhance his senses, while the Interloper uses his to generate fear in others, and Makkari uses his cosmic energies for superspeed.

===Limitations===
The 2006 retcon of the Eternals&#x27; origins and abilities introduces a significant limitation to their powers, and possibly to their free will, with numerous references to Eternals being &quot;programmed&quot; or &quot;hardwired.&quot; They cannot attack their Celestial &quot;masters&quot; for any reason, whether they make a conscious decision to do so or are tricked into accidentally striking the beings. Any such attempt shuts down the body of the attacking Eternal and is implied to be an automatic defense mechanism of the Celestials&#x27; armor. On one occasion, when the Eternals attempted to form a Uni-Mind with the intent of keeping the Dreaming Celestial asleep, they were shut down and reverted to their original forms. Furthermore, Eternals are compelled to attack and neutralize any being that attacks a Celestial.

As presented in Gaiman&#x27;s Volume 3, the Eternals are aware of their role on Earth and the duties and constraints placed on them by the Celestials. Ikaris describes himself as the Earth&#x27;s repair and maintenance unit. Zuras phrased the same concept more philosophically: &quot;We are the Eternals. We are the court of last resort for humanity and for all living things on Earth. [...] We do not choose sides. Countries are lines in the sand, empires rise and fall. We are timeless. We will still be here tomorrow, and a hundred centuries from now.&quot;

==Members==
===Generations===
The Eternals are split between five different generationals groups:
* First Generation Eternal (&quot;those born before the fall of Titanos&quot;): Arlok, Astron, Daina, Kronos/Chronos/Chronus, Master Elo, Oceanus, Shastra, Thyrio, Uranos.
* Second Generation Eternal (&quot;those alive at the time of Chronus&#x27;s experiment&quot;): Mentor (A&#x27;lars), Amaa, Cybele, Forgotten One/Gilgamesh, Helios, Perse, Rakar, Tulayn, Valkin, Virako, Zuras.
*Third Generation Eternal (&quot;those born after Chronos&#x27;s experiment but before the Second Host&quot;): Aginar, Ajak, Arex, Atlo, Domo, Ikaris, Interloper, Mara, Phastos, Sigmar, Thanos, Thena, Veron, Zarin, Eros
* Fourth Generation Eternal (&quot;those born after the coming of the Second Host, 20,000 years ago&quot;): Argos, Ceyote, Chi Demon, the Delphan brothers, Druig, Khoryphos, Makkari, Psykos, Sersi, Kingo Sunen, El Vampiro.
* Fifth Generation Eternal (&quot;those born after the coming of the Third Host, 3,000 years ago&quot;): Aurelle, Sprite, Titanis.

==Antecedents==
* Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s book &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; from 1953 provided inspiration, including the idea of &quot;Overlords&quot; who control Earth&#x27;s fate and will reveal themselves further after a 50-year waiting period, the idea of demons being humanity&#x27;s memory of another species, and the &quot;Overmind&quot; concept which seems to influence the comic&#x27;s &quot;Uni-Mind&quot;.
* Mercury and Hurricane, two characters depicted by Jack Kirby through Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel, were retconned as being guises of the Eternal Makkari.
==Reception==
Jeremy Brown of &quot;Game Rant&quot; ranked the Eternals 6th in their &quot;Marvel: Best Superhero Teams&quot; list. Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked the Eternals 7th in their &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy 3: 50 Marvel Characters We Want to See&quot; list.

== Literary reception ==

=== Volumes ===
The &quot;Eternals&quot; comic book series won Best Lettering and was nominated for Best Archival Collection/Project—Comic Books at the 2007 Eisner Awards.

==== &quot;Eternals&quot; (1976) ====
Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; stated, &quot;Jack Kirby delivered the original electrifying Eternals saga. Other than a Hulk robot (because reasons), there was no mention of the Marvel Universe anywhere in this series. But this was Kirby at his 1970s finest, getting all metaphysical and theological as he combined his imaginative saga with real world legend. Sersi does also turn a man&#x27;s face into Ben Grimm&#x27;s The Thing face in her introduction.&quot;

==== &quot;Eternals&quot; (2006) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Eternals&quot; #1 was the 17th best selling comic book in June 2006. &quot;Eternals&quot; #2 was the 28th best selling comic book in July 2006. &quot;Eternals&quot; #3 was the 28th best selling comic book in August 2006.

Jared Gaudreau of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; asserted, &quot;The seven-issue mini-series covered previous themes like creation and did an excellent job expanding Eternals lore and adding numerous new side characters. One of those great additions came in the form of a love interest for Thena named Thomas Eliot.&quot; Marc Buxton of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; wrote, &quot;This is a must read for any fan of American Gods as Gaiman and Romita examine recurring themes of mythology made real and they channel it all through a magnificent Kirby lens. Do not be surprised if the coming film borrows liberally from this fantastic series.&quot; Colin Cheney of &quot;Fatherly&quot; said, &quot;The series is a good, grounded way to enter the Eternals-verse: Romita’s art is appropriately bombastic, and we get some good bang-pow comics action—but it’s also pretty talky (because it’s Neil Gaiman). But also because it’s Neil Gaiman we get a nice right hook to the jaw of the problematic inspiration behind Kirby’s original comic.&quot;

==== &quot;Eternals&quot; (2008) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Eternals&quot; #1 was the 52nd best selling comic book in June 2008.

Thor Jensen of &quot;PCMag&quot; called the &quot;Eternals&quot; comic book series the &quot;last high-profile attempt to reboot the concept,&quot; stating, &quot;This was the bridge that brought the group into the modern era, and it’s a very solid read.&quot; Eric Diaz of &quot;Nerdist&quot; included the comic book series in their &quot;Essential &quot;Eternals&quot; Comics&quot; list, writing, &quot;Daniel Acuna provided memorable pencil art. In this short-lived comic, the Eternals are more intimately tied to the X-Men, with stories that crossed over with the mutant’s time in San Francisco. When the Dreaming Celestial awakens and towers over the mutant home city, it forces the Eternals to take action. Not one of the most well-known runs, and it only lasted eight issues and one Annual. But it is worth a read for sure.&quot;

==== &quot;Eternals&quot; (2021) ====
According to data combined from all direct market distributors, &quot;Eternals&quot; #1 was the 4th best selling comic book in January 2021.

Matthew Sibley of &quot;Newsarama&quot; asserted, &quot;&quot;Eternals&quot; #1 is not just a fresh start for the creative team and for potential readers, but also for the Eternals themselves to define who they are.&quot; Barry Thompson of &quot;Polygon&quot; said, &quot;In terms of execution, &quot;Eternals&quot; #1 is extremely good. Gillen introduces and entices the uninitiated without bogging itself down with exposition or patronizing anybody who brings some prior knowledge to the table. As far as fulfilling its primary functions, &quot;Eternals&quot; #1 checks all the necessary boxes.&quot; Colin Cheney of &quot;Fatherly&quot; asserted, &quot;Esad Ribic’s artwork — and the colors by Matthew Wilson — is quite beautiful and cinematic. The storytelling is sharp and clear: Gillen has a witty, wry way of letting his characters reveal themselves and the wider world. We get a good sense of the characters’ personalities (particularly Ikaris and Sprite) quite quickly… And hell: you get a little bit of Iron Man.&quot; Adam Barnhardt of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Eternals&quot; #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, saying, &quot;Readers looking for a strong character-driven story serving study on the likes of Ikaris, Sprite, and the remaining Eternals will find Gillen and Ribić&#x27;s Eternals #1 to be a delightful read. Readers looking for something akin to a blockbuster event may need to keep looking, save for an epic, applause-inducing cliffhanger. It&#x27;s an intriguing new start for readers new and old, alike and, at the very least, it&#x27;s evident this creative team is setting out to establish a definitive take for one of Marvel&#x27;s biggest unproven ideas.&quot;

<doc id="705421" wikidata="Q8518970" url="?curid=705421" title="Kvernberget">
<text>Kvernberget (literally &quot;Mill Cliff&quot; or &quot;Mill Mountain&quot;) is a barren mountain formation with a maximum elevation of . The mountain is located on the island of Nordlandet on the western edge of the town of Kristiansund in Kristiansund Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, which sits nearby, takes its name from the mountain.

For a number of years, Kvernberget and the surrounding area have been popular for hiking and simple mountaineering activities, and the summit is Kristiansund&#x27;s most popular hiking destination. From the summit, much of the Nordmøre district of Møre og Romsdal county may be seen in fair weather. A drinking water reservoir is located inside the mountain.

==Navigation==
By the early Middle Ages, there was already a need to navigate the ocean north of Nordmøre, a long time before 1742, the year Kristiansund became a town. The most important urban area of Nordmøre in the Middle Ages was the fishing village of Grip, an island in the ocean north of Kristiansund. For the fishermen in the area, it was important to find their regular fishing places, so they observed the land and used mountains such as &quot;Kvernberget&quot; and other landmarks to find their way.

==History==

Løwenørn, a Danish mariner, described this part of the Norwegian coast in 1791–1803. He tells that Kvernberget was used by the navigators on board ships just outside Trondheimsleia. He mentions all the mountains on shore: Skarven (on Tustna), Stemshesten, &quot;Magnillberget&quot;, Freikollen, &quot;Quærn-Bierget&quot; (an old-fashioned way to spell Kvernberget), and &quot;Plak-Myssen&quot;.

==Name==
The name &quot;Kvernberget&quot; is probably a thousand years old, and refers to the mountain&#x27;s resemblance to a medieval Quern-stone of a form which is still used in North Africa today. Fishermen working in the sea off of the island and fishing village of Grip navigated by the mountain, which they named after the tool they had at home, the hand mill for grinding corn to flour.

A lot of mountains along the Norwegian shore are obviously named because they look like something. &quot;Bjønnahaugen&quot; (the bears hill), on Nordlandet in Kristiansund, looks like a sleeping bear. On Averøya, west of Kristiansund, is a mountain that is called &quot;Bremsneshatten&quot;, which is thought to look like a hat. Løwenørn calls it &quot;Plak-Myssen&quot; (a kind of seal), in the Middle Ages it was probably Brimill. The mountain looks like the head of a seal sticking out of the seabed.

<doc id="705422" wikidata="Q39091086" url="?curid=705422" title="Supernatural beings in Slavic religion">
<text>Other than the many gods and goddesses of the Slavs, the ancient Slavs believed in and revered many supernatural beings that existed in nature. These supernatural beings in Slavic religion come in various forms, and the same name of any single being can be spelled or transliterated differently according to language and transliteration system.

== Vila ==
&quot;Vila&quot; (pl. &quot;vile&quot;, Slovak/Czech &quot;víly&quot;) is a fairy that is similar to a nymph, identified as a nymph by the Greek historian Procopius; their name comes from the same root as the name of Veles. They are described as beautiful, eternally young, dressed in white, with eyes flashing like thunders, and provided with wings, and blonde hair. They live in the clouds, in mountain woods or in the waters. They are well-disposed towards men, and can turn themselves into horses, wolves, snakes, falcons and swans. The cult of the Vilas was still practised among South Slavs in the early twentieth century, with offerings of fruits and flowers in caves, cakes near wells, and ribbons hung from the branches of trees.

==Rusalka==

In Slavic mythology, Rusalka is a water nymph, a female spirit who lives in rivers. In most versions, rusalka is an unquiet being who is no longer alive, associated with the unclean spirit (&quot;Nav&quot;) and dangerous. According to Dmitry Zelenin, people who die violently and before their time, such as young women who commit suicide because they have been jilted by their lovers, or unmarried women who are pregnant out of wedlock, must live out their designated time on earth as a spirit. Another theory is that &quot;rusalki&quot; are the female spirits of the unclean dead; this includes suicides, unbaptised babies, and those who die without last rites. (Under this theory, male unclean dead were said to become vodyanoy.)

==Vodyanoy, Vodník==
The vodyanoy is a male water spirit of Slavic origin. The Czech and Slovak equivalent is called a &quot;vodník&quot;, Polish is a &quot;wodnik&quot;, in Russian it is &quot;vodyanoy&quot; and &quot;vodyanyk&quot; in Ukrainian. A South Slavic equivalent is &quot;vodenjak&quot;. He is viewed to be particularly malevolent, existing almost exclusively to drown swimmers who have angered him by their boldness. Reports of his appearance vary; some tales define him as a naked old man, bloated and hairy, covered in slime, covered in scales, or simply as an old peasant with a red shirt and beard. He is also reported to have the ability to transform into a fish.

The vodyanoy lives in deep pools, often by a mill, and is said to be the spirit of unclean male dead (this definition includes those who have committed suicide, unbaptized children, and those who die without last rites). As previously stated, the vodyanoy would drown those who angered him with boasts or insults. However, there was no certain protection, as the spirit was particularly capricious. Peasants feared the vodyanoy and would often attempt to get rid of the spirit or, failing that, appease him.

The only people who were generally safe from the vodyanoy&#x27;s anger were millers and fishermen. Millers in particular were viewed to be so close to the vodyanoy that they often became seen as sorcerous figures. This may be influenced by the belief that millers yearly drown a drunk passerby as an offering to the vodyanoy. Fishermen were somewhat less suspect, offering only the first of their catch with an incantation. If a vodyanoy favored a fisherman, he would herd fish into the nets.

==Bereginya==

Bereginyas (Russian), Berehynias (Ukrainian) or Brzeginias (Polish) are obscure fairies mentioned in &quot;The Lay of St. Gregory the Theologian of the Idols&quot;, which has been preserved in a 15th-century Novgorod manuscript. &quot;The Lay&quot; is a compilation of translations from Greek sources studded with comments by a 12th-century Kievan monk. The text, which seems to have been considerably revised by later scribes, does mention &quot;vampires and bereginyas&quot; as the earliest creatures worshipped by the Slavs, even before the cult of Perun was introduced in their lands. No detail about &quot;bereginyas&quot; are given, affording a large field for speculations of every kind.

Boris Rybakov connects the term with the Slavic word for &quot;riverbank&quot; and reasons that the term referred to Slavic mermaids, although, unlike rusalkas, they were benevolent in nature. The scholar identifies the worship of vampires and bereginyas as a form of &quot;dualistic animism&quot; practiced by the Slavs in the most ancient period of their history. According to him, the term was replaced by &quot;rusalka&quot; in most areas, surviving into the 20th century only in the Russian North. After the publication of Rybakov&#x27;s research, the &quot;bereginya&quot; has become a popular concept with Slavic neo-pagans who conceive of it as a powerful pagan goddess rather than a mere water sprite.

==Modern fiction==

* The &quot;Winternight&quot; trilogy, by Katherine Arden, is inspired by Slavic mythology and includes many characters, such as the Domovoy, the Rusalka and other beings.
* In Edward Fallon&#x27;s second book in his &quot;Linger&quot; series of novels, &quot;Trail of the Beast&quot;, a rusalka taunts a trio hunting a serial killer.
* C. J. Cherryh has written three novels, &quot;Rusalka&quot;, &quot;Chernevog&quot; and &quot;Yvgenie&quot;, set in a world inspired by Russian folktales that feature, amongst others, rusalka, vodyanoy, and leshy.
* In &quot;Changes&quot;, a novel in the &quot;Dresden Files&quot; series by Jim Butcher, the fairy Toot-Toot, a Polevoi, is enraged when he is mistakenly called a Domovoy by Sanya, the Russian Knight of the Cross.
* The videogame &quot;Quest For Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness&quot;, set in the Slavic countryside of a fictional east-European valley, features several Slavic fairies, including the Rusalka, Domovoy, and Leshy.
* Catherynne Valente&#x27;s novel &quot;Deathless&quot; is set in a fantasy version of Stalinist Russia and features vila, rusalka, leshy, and other Slavic fairies.
* Dorothy Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Reaper&#x27;s Rite&quot; series depicts Vila as magical beings of half-faery, half-witch origin.
* In J. K. Rowling&#x27;s novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, Veela are the mascots of the Bulgarian Quidditch Team at the World Cup. Fleur Delacour&#x27;s grandmother was a Veela and Fleur&#x27;s wand contains a strand of a veela hair.
* Piers Anthony&#x27;s Xanth novels include a few Vily, as nature spirits bound to a tree (similar to a dryad) with powers of shapeshifting and cleansing or poisoning water, and extremely quick to anger.
* Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s &quot;Wiedźmin&quot; series as well as the &quot;Witcher&quot; video games based on it are set in a medieval Slavic fantasy world. Many of the monsters are taken directly from or inspired by Slavic mythology, such as the rusalka, the striga, and the vodyanoi.

<text>The Roland Space Echo is a line of tape delay units introduced by Roland Corporation in 1974. 

Whereas prior tape delay effects used tape reels, the Space Echo uses a free-running tape transport system. This reduces tape wear, noise, and wow and flutter, and made the units more reliable and easy to transport. Some units also feature spring reverb and chorus effects. 

Space Echo units have been used in genres such as reggae, dub, trip hop, post-punk and experimental rock. In 2007, the Roland subsidiary Boss began producing Space Echo pedals that recreate the sounds of the original units.

== Production ==

In 1960, the Japanese engineer Ikutaro Kakehashi founded Ace Electronic Industries. He began selling tape delay devices, such as the Ace Tone EC-1 Echo Chamber, in the late 1960s. In 1972, Kakehashi founded Roland Corporation. In 1973, Roland released the RE-100 and RE-200 tape delay units, which used a short 1/4&quot; tape loop.

In 1974, Roland released the first Space Echo units in two models: the RE-101 and the RE-201, which also included spring reverb. Instead of the tape reel used in previous tape echo units, the Space Echo uses a free-running tape transport system. The tape spools freely within a chamber, using a capstan drive protected by a plastic cover. This reduces tape wear, noise, and wow and flutter.

The RE-101 and RE-201 were followed by the RE-150, which had two playback heads and different controls. In 1977, Roland released the RE-301 Chorus Echo, which features a chorus effect, followed in 1980 by the rackmount RE-501 and RE-555 units. The digital RE-3 and RE-5 units were released in 1988. The RE-201 Space Echo remained in production until 1990.

In 2007, the Roland subsidiary Boss released the RE-20 pedal, with digital modelling of the original Space Echo sound. It includes a &quot;twist&quot; feature that increases the feedback and speed of the delay, creating a &quot;swirling cacophony&quot; effect. In 2023, Boss released an updated pedal, the RE-202, alongside the smaller RE-2.

== Features ==
The original Space Echo units contain a single recording head and three playback heads. The combination of tape heads is controlled with a rotary knob. Users may adjust the bass and treble levels on the output sound, the number of echo repeats, the length of each echo, and the ratio of the echo and reverb sounds. The Space Echo has two microphone inputs, one instrument input, and one input for a mixer or PA.

The character of the delay sound changes as the tape wears with use. Michael Dregni of &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot; described the Space Echo sound as &quot;warm, rich and organic&quot;. In &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, Paul White wrote that &quot;the term &#x27;musical&#x27; is often over-used, but it really did apply to the RE-201, in that the echoes were warm and didn&#x27;t get in the way of the original sound&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Space Echo was a commercial success. The first units were more reliable and sturdy than previous tape echo devices, making them easy to travel and perform with. They were used by musicians in genres such as reggae, dub, trip hop, post-punk and experimental rock.

The American guitarist Brian Setzer used the Space Echo to recreate the slapback sound distinctive to rockabilly music, and the Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley used it to create &quot;deep, throbbing&quot; echoes. The Jamaican reggae producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry used it extensively in the 1970s. The English alternative rock bands Radiohead and Portishead used the Space Echo&#x27;s tape speed controls to create pitch-shifting effects.

In later years, solid-state delay effects became popular for their reliability and more faithful reproduction of sound. However, tape delay effects such as the Space Echo remained popular for the way the tape compresses and distorts, &quot;creating the impression that the echoes are receding rather than just getting quieter&quot;.

<text>Major General Sir James Holborne of Menstrie was a Scottish soldier during the years of the English Civil War. He eventually reached the rank of Major General and fought with the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War, fighting at Newbury and Taunton. Although he initially fought on the side of the English Parliament, he later became a senior officer in the Scottish Army, fighting against Cromwell. He lived at Menstrie Castle, in Menstrie, Clackmannanshire, central Scotland, which he had purchased in 1649.

==Action in the Civil War==

James Holborne led a brigade of infantry in the Parliamentarian army of the Earl of Essex at the first Battle of Newbury in 1643. He was with Sir William Waller&#x27;s army at the Battle of Cropredy Bridge on 29 June 1644. At Stowe St Mary, near Tavistock, in January 1645, Sydenham House, a large Elizabethan mansion on the banks of the River Lyd, then being garrisoned for the King, was taken by Colonel Holborne. In April that year, Holborne was offered command of a regiment of foot in the New Model Army, but like several prominent Scottish and Presbyterian officers, he declined.

Holborne was a Major General by 1645, when he was nominated, with the Earl of Leven, and Lord Kirkcudbright, as a deputation from the Convention of Estates, the most powerful party in Scotland at that time, to open negotiations with Oliver Cromwell, whose army was then at Berwick. On 4 October 1648 Cromwell made his first visit to Edinburgh. The Lord Kirkcudbright and Major General Holborne conducted him into the city, where he was lodged in the Earl of Moray&#x27;s house in the Canongate.

By the autumn of 1650, James Holborne was fighting against Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar. After the defeat of the Covenanting army by Cromwell at Dunbar, Charles II had been crowned by Argyll at Scone in Scotland, assuming personal command of the Scottish army, he managed to restrain Cromwell at Stirling for a month. Cromwell tried to turn the Scottish flank by sending a force under Colonel Overton into Fife. To defeat this attempt, Charles sent forward a contingent under two officers, Brown and James Holborne of Menstrie, with twelve hundred horse and fifteen hundred infantry, and on Sunday 20 July a battle took place on the north shore of the Forth at Inverkeithing. In that encounter, Holborne showed himself uncertain of his new allegiance. At the beginning of the battle Holborne fled with his cavalry, and although Brown, with a small force of infantry under Sir Hector Maclean and Sir George Buchanan fought bravely, they were defeated, the army being &#x27;cut to pieces&#x27;.

Major General Holborne later arrived at Ardvreck Castle, Sutherland, as escort for James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, who was held captive by Neil Macleod after his defeat at Carbisdale, to be led to Edinburgh by a troop of horse by order of General David Leslie to meet his judges and his death on 4 May 1650. On 5 May, Montrose thus begun his long and humiliating captive journey, and on 6 May, Major General Holborne took shelter at Skibo Castle, the home of the dowager Lady Gray. Lady Gray, being loyal to the King, requested Montrose to be seated next to her at dinner. Major General Holborne insisted on a strict military order to affairs, and placed the Marquis between himself and another officer. With this breach of etiquette, the Lady Gray flew into a violent rage, and seizing upon a leg of roasted mutton by the shank she confronted the Major General with &quot;such a notable blow on his head, knocking him of his seat.&quot;

The officers took alarm, expecting an attempt to rescue their prisoner. Lady Gray promptly reminded them that they were her guests and as such, as gentleman they should accommodate themselves to such an adjustment of place at her table, as she considered to be correct. Order having been restored, mutton replaced to the table, every possible civility was thereafter directed by all present toward the Marquis.

On 7 May, Montrose was ferried across Dornoch Firth to Tain, where General David Leslie took personal command of the procession. Montrose was led down the east coast of Scotland on the long journey toward Edinburgh, where he was met at the town&#x27;s Watergate and the sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was pronounced.

===Family===
One &quot;James Holburn&quot; was recorded as having married Helen Millar on 29 July 1680 at Muthill, Perthshire in Scotland. A reference in the International Genealogical Index records a second marriage, to Margaret Gordon, which took place on 30 August 1682 at Monimail, Fife.

Holborne&#x27;s son, also named James (d. 1737), was admitted as advocate on 23 November 1714, becoming thereafter an Examiner in the Exchequer. This James was married at first to Janet Inglis of Cramond, and later to Jean, the daughter of Alexander Spital of Leuchat. His son, another James (d. 1758), was created a baronet in 1706, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia.

Among the descendants of Major General Holburne are Sir Alexander Holburn, 3rd Baronet, Admiral Sir Francis Holburne, and Thomas William Holborne, 5th Baronet, founder of the Holburne Museum of Art in Bath, all of whom served in the Royal Navy.

Major General Holborne was a relation of Sir Robert Holborne, the attorney general of King James I.

<text>Maria Luisa Pierangeli (19 June 1932 – 6 December 2023), known professionally as Marisa Pavan, was an Italian actress who first became known as the twin sister of film star Pier Angeli (Anna Maria Pierangeli) before achieving success in her screen career. She received an Academy Award nomination and won a Golden Globe Award for her performance in the 1955 film &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Pavan and her fraternal twin sister, Pier Angeli, were born in 1932 in Cagliari, Sardinia, the children of Enrichetta (née Romiti) and Luigi Pierangeli, a construction engineer. The two girls also had a younger sister, Patrizia Pierangeli, who became an actress as well. Her stage name, Pavan, was the surname of a Jewish general in the Italian Army she and her family hid during the Nazi occupation of Rome in World War II.

Pavan had no dramatic training when she signed a Hollywood contract with Paramount at age 19. Although her screen debut was in 1952 in &quot;What Price Glory&quot;, Pavan&#x27;s breakthrough role came three years later, when she was cast as Anna Magnani&#x27;s daughter in &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;. That part was initially assigned to her twin sister, but by the time production began, Angeli was unavailable for the role. Pavan&#x27;s performance earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She also won the Golden Globe Award for (Best Supporting Actress) for her performance in the film.
Pavan co-starred in films such as &quot;Diane&quot; (1956), &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot; (1956), &quot;The Midnight Story&quot; (1957) and &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959). She also played Abishag in King Vidor&#x27;s biblical epic &quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; (1959). Her later films included &quot;A Slightly Pregnant Man&quot; (1973), &quot;Antoine and Sebastian&quot; (1974) and the television miniseries &quot;The Moneychangers&quot; (1976). In 1985, she played Chantal Dubujak on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
On 27 March 1956, Pavan married French actor Jean-Pierre Aumont in Santa Barbara, California, and the couple remained together until Aumont&#x27;s death in 2001. They had two sons.

Pavan died at her home in Gassin, France on 6 December 2023, aged 91.

<text>Café Naturale is the sixth studio album by singer Wendy Matthews, released by BMG in Australia on 24 May 2004. It is an album of cover songs chosen by Matthews and the album&#x27;s producer, Michael Szumowski. The album yielded only one single, &quot;All I Need&quot;.

In 2002, Matthews moved to a coastal haven outside Coffs Harbour, New South Wales. She spent a lot of time in her favourite cafe listening to records, and explains &quot;there’s nothing like a song to bring you back to a specific moment or feeling in time.&quot; This led her to name the album &quot;Café Naturale&quot;.

She was surprised by some of the song choices. &quot;Once we got into the studio the record started to reveal its personality to me. It all came together and the songs, these very melodic songs, started to make themselves known. It just worked.&quot;

The thought behind the album&#x27;s cover artwork comes from a painting of a woman on a wall on Edgecliff Road in Sydney, Australia by Bruno Dutot in 1987. Matthews approached Dutot and she asked him to commission a painting of this woman for her cover. She states &quot;basically, he&#x27;s painted her as me with a chopstick in her hair and my dog at the feet. Every time I&#x27;m in Sydney I have to go and check the lady on the wall, what colour dress she&#x27;s wearing this month, whether she&#x27;s changed and she looks so cafe society to me, so I&#x27;m thrilled and honoured that he actually did a painting for this cover.&quot; Matthews says the painting has come to symbolise Sydney for her.

<text>Paola Suárez (; born 23 June 1976) is a retired tennis player from Argentina. She was one of the most prominent women&#x27;s doubles players throughout the early and mid-2000s, winning eight Grand Slam titles, all of them with Virginia Ruano Pascual, and holding the No. 1 doubles ranking for 87 non-consecutive weeks. She was also a singles top ten player and semifinalist at the 2004 French Open.

==Career==
Suárez began playing professional tennis at the age of 15. In 1994, she joined the professional tour as a singles player.

Suárez won four WTA titles (2004 Canberra, 2003 Vienna, 1998 &amp; 2001 Bogotá) and 12 other minor tournaments. In 2004, she reached her only Grand Slam singles semi-final by defeating the 18th seed and future Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, but lost to Elena Dementieva. That year, she reached her highest WTA ranking of No. 9, to become the highest-ranked Argentine women&#x27;s player since Gabriela Sabatini achieved the No. 3 ranking in 1989. Also in 2004, she won the bronze medal at the Olympic Games in Athens for the women&#x27;s doubles with Patricia Tarabini.

She had success in singles but her best results came in doubles, winning more than half a dozen titles partnering fellow Argentine Laura Montalvo. However Suárez&#x27;s more long-standing doubles partnership was with the Spaniard Virginia Ruano Pascual, with whom she won 32 of her 39 titles. Besides numerous WTA Tour titles, they won the French Open on four occasions, the US Open three times, and the Australian Open in 2004. Suárez and Ruano Pascual were the No. 1 female pair for three consecutive years after 9 September 2002 and were the WTA Tour Doubles Team of the Year in 2002, 2003 and 2004. They also reached nine straight Grand Slam finals, two short of Navratilova and Shriver&#x27;s record of eleven.

In 2005, Suárez announced her forthcoming retirement for personal reasons. In June of that year, she underwent a labrum hip clinical intervention, with a recovery time of three to four months. She restarted playing in Sydney in January 2006 with Ruano Pascual, reaching the final, but suffered a calf injury short after. Later that year, she also reached the final of Wimbledon with Ruano Pascual, marking her third appearance in a final there.

Suárez returned to the circuit with a victory over Dinara Safina, ranked No. 15, in the San Diego Open singles tournament.

On 1 September 2007, Suárez retired after losing in the mixed doubles second round at the US Open. She partnered Kevin Ullyett and lost to Jamie Murray and Liezel Huber, 5–7, 4–6. She briefly returned to the WTA doubles tour in 2012, partnering her fellow Argentinian Gisela Dulko. The pair played at the London Summer Olympics but lost in the first round.

In her career, Suárez earned more than $5.2 million, with four singles titles on the WTA Tour, and eight doubles Grand Slam titles.

<text>Web Services Security (WS-Security, WSS) is an extension to SOAP to apply security to Web services. It is a member of the Web service specifications and was published by OASIS.

The protocol specifies how integrity and confidentiality can be enforced on messages and allows the communication of various security token formats, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Kerberos, and X.509. Its main focus is the use of XML Signature and XML Encryption to provide end-to-end security.

==Features==
WS-Security describes three main mechanisms:
* How to sign SOAP messages to assure integrity. Signed messages also provide non-repudiation.
* How to encrypt SOAP messages to assure confidentiality.
* How to attach security tokens to ascertain the sender&#x27;s identity.

The specification allows a variety of signature formats, encryption algorithms and multiple trust domains, and is open to various security token models, such as:
* X.509 certificates,
* Kerberos tickets,
* User ID/Password credentials,
* SAML Assertions, and
* custom-defined tokens.
The token formats and semantics are defined in the associated profile documents.

WS-Security incorporates security features in the header of a SOAP message, working in the application layer.

These mechanisms by themselves do not provide a complete security solution for Web services. Instead, this specification is a building block that can be used in conjunction with other Web service extensions and higher-level application-specific protocols to accommodate a wide variety of security models and security technologies. In general, WSS by itself does not provide any guarantee of security. When implementing and using the framework and syntax, it is up to the implementor to ensure that the result is not vulnerable.

Key management, trust bootstrapping, federation and agreement on the technical details (ciphers, formats, algorithms) is outside the scope of WS-Security.

==Use cases==
===End-to-end security===
If a SOAP intermediary is required, and the intermediary is not more or less trusted, messages need to be signed and optionally encrypted. This might be the case of an application-level proxy at a network perimeter that will terminate TCP (transmission control protocol) connections.

===Non-repudiation===
One method for non-repudiation is to write transactions to an audit trail that is subject to specific security safeguards. Digital signatures, which WS-Security supports, provide a more direct and verifiable non-repudiation proof.

===Alternative transport bindings===
Although almost all SOAP services implement HTTP bindings, in theory other bindings such as JMS or SMTP could be used; in this case end-to-end security would be required.

===Reverse proxy/common security token===
Even if the web service relies upon transport layer security, it might be required for the service to know about the end user, if the service is relayed by a (HTTP-) reverse proxy. A WSS header could be used to convey the end user&#x27;s token, vouched for by the reverse proxy.

==Issues==
* If there are frequent message exchanges between service provider and consumer, the overhead of XML SIG and XML ENC are significant. If end-to-end security is required, a protocol like WS-SecureConversation may reduce the overhead. If it&#x27;s sufficient, use only encryption &quot;or&quot; signing, as the combination of both is significantly slower than the mere sum of the single operations. See Performance below.
* The merging of several XML schemata like SOAP, SAML, XML ENC, XML SIG might cause dependencies on different versions of library functions like canonicalization and parsing, which are difficult to manage in an application server.
* If only CBC mode encryption/decryption is applied or if the CBC mode decryption is applied without verifying a secure checksum (signature or MAC) before decryption then the implementation is likely to be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks.

==Performance==
WS-Security adds significant overhead to SOAP processing due to the increased size of the message on the wire, XML and cryptographic processing, requiring faster CPUs and more memory and bandwidth.

An evaluation in 2005 measured 25 types of SOAP messages of different size and complexity processed by WSS4J with both WS-Security and WS-SecureConversation on a Pentium 4/2.8 GHz CPU.
Some findings were:
* Encryption was faster than signing.
* Encryption and signing together were 2–7 times slower than signing alone and produced significantly bigger documents.
* Depending on the type of message, WS-SecureConversation either made no difference or reduced processing time by half in the best case.
* It took less than 10 milliseconds to sign or encrypt up to an array of 100 kilobytes, but it took about 100~200 to perform the security operations for SOAP.

Another benchmark in 2006 resulted in this comparison:
==History==
Web services initially relied on the underlying transport security. In fact, most implementations still do. As SOAP allows for multiple transport bindings, such as HTTP and SMTP, a SOAP-level security mechanism was needed. The lack of end-to-end security because of the dependence on transport security was another factor.

The protocol was originally developed by IBM, Microsoft, and VeriSign. Their original specification was published on 5 April 2002 and was followed up by an addendum on 18 August 2002.

In 2002, two proposals were submitted to the OASIS WSS Technical Committee: Web Service Security (WS-Security) and Web Services Security Addendum. As a result, WS-Security was published:
* WS-Security 1.0 was released on 19 April 2004.
* Version 1.1 was released on 17 February 2006.

The version 1.0 standard published by OASIS contained a number of significant differences to the standard proposed by the IBM, Microsoft and VeriSign consortium. Many systems were developed using the proposed standard and the differences made them incompatible with systems developed to the OASIS standard.

Some refer to the pre-OASIS specification as the &quot;WS-Security Draft 13&quot;, or as the Web Services Security Core Specification. However these names are not widely known and indeed today it is hard to clearly identify whether an application or server is using a pre- or post-OASIS specification. Most forum posts use the keyword &quot;WSSE&quot; to refer to the pre-OASIS version because it mandated the use of a &quot;wsse&quot; XML namespace prefix to the URL (and similar URLs of different versions).

The protocol is officially called WSS and developed via committee in Oasis-Open.

==Associated specifications==
The following draft specifications are associated with WS-Security: WS-Federation, WS-Privacy, WS-Test.

The following approved specifications are associated with WS-Security: WS-Policy, WS-SecureConversation, WS-Trust, ID-WSF.

The following architectures make use of WS-Security: TAS3.

==Alternative==
In point-to-point situations confidentiality and data integrity can also be enforced on Web services through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), for example, by sending messages over HTTPS. WS-Security, however, addresses the wider problem of maintaining integrity and confidentiality of messages until after a message is sent from the originating node, providing so-called end to end security.

Applying TLS can significantly reduce the overhead involved by removing the need to encode keys and message signatures into XML before sending. A challenge in using TLS would be if messages needed to go through an application-level proxy server, as it would need to be able to see the request for routing. In such an example, the server would see the request coming from the proxy, not the client; this could be worked around by having the proxy have a copy of the client&#x27;s key and certificate, or by having a signing certificate trusted by the server, with which it could generate a key/certificate pair matching those of the client. However, as the proxy is not operating on the message, it does not ensure end-to-end security, but only ensures point-to-point security.

<text>John Yonge ( – 25 April 1516) was an English ecclesiastic and diplomatist, who also served as Master of the Rolls from 1507 until his death.

He is not to be confused with his contemporary John Young (suffragan bishop in London) (1463–1526).

==Life==
John Yonge was born at Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, and educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford, where he became a fellow in 1485. Probably the son of John Yonge, Lord Mayor of London (elected 1466), he was ordained in 1500 and held several livings (and the office of Archdeacon of Barnstaple) before receiving his first diplomatic mission to arrange a commercial treaty with the archduke of Austria in 1504, and in the Low Countries in 1506 in connection with the projected marriage between Henry VII and Margaret of Savoy.

In 1507 he was made Master of the Rolls, and in the following year was employed in various diplomatic missions. He was one of the ambassadors who arranged the Holy League in 1513, and accompanied Henry VIII during the ensuing campaign. He was on terms of close friendship with Dean Colet, and was a correspondent of Erasmus.

In 1514 he was made dean of York in succession to Wolsey, and in 1515 he was one of the commissioners for renewing the peace with Francis I. In the same year he became archdeacon of Barnstaple.

Yonge died in London on 25 April 1516. His effigial tomb monument is in the former Rolls Chapel, now part of the Maughan Library, King&#x27;s College London.

<doc id="705478" wikidata="Q6255541" url="?curid=705478" title="John Romilly, 1st Baron Romilly">
<text>John Romilly, 1st Baron Romilly PC (20 January 1802 – 23 December 1874), known as Sir John Romilly between 1848 and 1866, was an English Whig politician and judge. He served in Lord John Russell&#x27;s first administration as Solicitor-General from 1848 to 1850 and as Attorney-General from 1850 and 1851. The latter year he was appointed Master of the Rolls, a post he held until 1873. Knighted in 1848, he was ennobled as Baron Romilly in 1866.

==Early life==
Romilly was born in London, the second son of Sir Samuel Romilly and the former Anne Garbett, a daughter of Francis Garbett of Knill Court, Herefordshire. After serving as Solicitor-General for England and Wales, his father became a Member of Parliament for Horsham, Wareham, Arundel, and Westminster. Among his siblings was sister Sophia Romilly (wife of Thomas Francis Kennedy, MP for Ayr Burghs), and younger brothers Charles Romilly (who married Lady Georgiana Russell, a daughter of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford), Frederick Romilly (who served as MP for Canterbury).

He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn, in 1827.

==Career==
Romilly first entered Parliament in 1832 as member for Bridport, holding the seat from 1832 to 1835 and again from 1846 to 1847. In 1843 he became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. He was elected Member of Parliament for Devonport in 1847, and was appointed Solicitor-General and knighted in 1848 in Lord John Russell&#x27;s administration, being promoted to Attorney-General in 1850. In 1851 he was appointed Master of the Rolls, and continued to sit for Devonport until the general election in 1852, when he was defeated. He was the last Master of the Rolls to sit in Parliament.

Romilly was raised to the peerage as Baron Romilly, of Barry in the County of Glamorgan, in 1866, and retired from the mastership of the rolls in 1873. He did much to remove the restrictions which had long hampered research among the public records and state papers.

===Notable judicial decisions===

Notable judicial decisions of Romilly include: &quot;Norris v Chambres&quot; (1861) 29 Beav 246, 54 ER 621: whether an equitable lien could be claimed in immovable property overseas against a third party.

==Personal life==
Lord Romilly married Caroline Charlotte, daughter of the Right Reverend William Otter, in 1833. They had several children, including:

* William Romilly, 2nd Baron Romilly (1835–1891), who married Emily Idonea Sophia Le Marchant, eldest daughter of Lt.-Gen. Sir John Le Marchant, in 1865. After her death in 1866, he married Helen Denison, eldest daughter of Edward Hanson Denison, in 1872.
* Hon. Edward Romilly (1838–1886), a barrister who married Edith Mary Cowie (d. 1880), second daughter of Benjamin Morgan Cowie, Dean of Manchester, in 1871.
* Hon. Henry Romilly (1845–1886), who married Edith Rathbone, eldest daughter of Bernard Rathbone, in 1878. After his death in 1886, she married Thomas Northcote Toller of Lansdowne House in Didsbury in 1889.
* Hon. Arthur Romilly, barrister (1850–1884), who married Flora Schellbach (d. 1937), second daughter of Prof Schellbach of Berlin, in 1877.
* Hon. Anne Romilly (d. 1913), who married Clement Tudway Swanston QC (d. 1879) in 1861.
* Hon. Mary Romilly (d. 1921), who married Gen. Sir Lothian Nicholson KCB, Governor of Gibraltar (d. 1893) in 1864.
* Hon. Sophie Romilly (–1895)
* Hon. Lucy Henrietta Romilly (d. 1923), who married Henry Crompton (d. 1904), second son of Charles John Crompton in 1870.

Lady Romilly died in December 1856. Lord Romilly died in London on 23 December 1874, aged 72, and was succeeded in the barony his eldest son, William. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

===Descendants===
Through his son Edward, he was a grandfather of Sybil Edith Mary Romilly (b. 1880), who married her cousin Admiral Sir Douglas Romilly Lothian Nicholson KCMG KCVO (d. 1946), in 1907.

Through his son Henry, he was a grandfather of Sophie Katherine Romilly (1879–1904).

<doc id="705483" wikidata="Q99308" url="?curid=705483" title="Harald Kreutzberg">
<text>Harald Kreutzberg (December 11, 1902 – April 25, 1968) was a German dancer and choreographer associated with the Ausdruckstanz movement, a form in which the individual, artistic expression of feelings or emotions is essential. Though largely forgotten by the 21st century, he was the most famous German male dancer of the 20th century.

==Education and early career==
Kreutzberg was born in Reichenberg, Austria-Hungary (now Liberec in the northernmost part of Bohemia, Czech Republic). He and his family subsequently lived in Breslau, Leipzig and Dresden, Germany. His father and grandfather worked as circus performers and wild animal act entertainers. His mother encouraged his penchant for play-acting and theatricality. At age 6, he entertained at Dresden&#x27;s operetta house.

He attended the Academy of Applied Art in Dresden; he was reportedly an excellent draftsman. From an early age, Kreutzberg was also interested in costuming and style. During the years of hyperinflation in the Weimer Republic, he assisted with family finances by designing women&#x27;s clothing for a local department store. In 1920, he performed a &quot;hashish dance&quot; at a student carnival. The piece was so well received, he decided to enroll in dance classes.

Kreutzberg trained at the Dresden Ballet School and studied with the founders of Ausdruckstanz, Mary Wigman and Rudolf von Laban. The Ausdruckstanz phenomenon of the early to mid-20th century flourished in German-speaking Europe. It grew out of the Lebensreform (life reform) movement which promoted physical culture, among other healthy practices, as a means of rejecting the industrialization, materialism and urbanization of modern life.

In 1923, he accepted the invitation of Max Terpis, a former Wigman student, to dance in Hannover where Terpis directed the Municipal Opera Ballet. Dancing with a large ensemble made Kreutzberg somewhat uncomfortable. Sensing this and recognizing his gift for acting, the opera director cast him in small, yet unforgettable, character roles. When Terpis accepted the position of ballet director for the Berlin State Opera, he took Kreutzberg with him.

In 1926, Kreutzberg appeared as &quot;Fear&quot; in the ballet &quot;Die Nächtlichen.&quot; The role was meant to depict a sinister, dissonant evocation of demonic forces. Terpis&#x27; next production was &quot;Don Morte&quot;, a version of Edgar Allen Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;. For this piece, Kreutzberg danced the role of an eccentric jester, wearing a gold costume and mask with bald head. The opera costume shop had trouble making a bald wig, so Kreutzberg shaved off all of his blond hair. His appearance made such a strong impression on audiences, he maintained the signature look for the rest of his life. &quot;Don Morte&quot; also initiated the lifelong collaboration between Kreutzberg and Friedrich Wilckens, Kreutzberg&#x27;s composer, piano accompanist and life partner.

In 1927, theater director Max Reinhardt cast Kreutzberg in Salzburg productions of &quot;Turnadot&quot; and &quot;Jedermann&quot; and, later, as Puck for a New York production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1929).

==Partnership with Yvonne Georgi==

When he returned to Hannover in 1928, Kreutzberg collaborated with Wilckens and Yvonne Georgi, a former student of von Laban, on a grotesque pantomime, &quot;Robes, Pierre and Co.&quot;, which presented a man falling murderously in love with a shop window mannequin. It featured dance sequences accompanied by the sound of typewriters, gunshots and Kreutzberg himself singing a falsetto parody of a coloratura aria.

Between 1929 and 1931, Kreutzberg and Georgi made four comprehensive tours of both Europe and the U.S., where they appeared on both coasts and throughout the Midwest, possibly as the most profitable modern dance act in U.S. history. Their enormously popular performances introduced Ausdruckstanz to a widespread audience that delighted in their artistry. Eyewitnesses to the productions were overwhelmed by Kreutzberg&#x27;s charisma, he &quot;added a theatricality that we did not have at this time,&quot; said one. Another recalled &quot;his dramatic quality and terrific intensity…on stage he appeared seven foot tall, and he had a demanding spaciousness utilizing the whole stage.&quot;

Georgi and Kreutzberg&#x27;s programs consisted of solos by both performers interspersed with duets. The dances focused on an austere, streamlined modern aesthetic. Both were muscular, athletic dancers who enjoyed showing off their physical prowess and dexterity; both were prone to melancholy choreographic moods: Georgi to dionysian impulses and Kreutzberg to the grotesque, demonic and macabre. The dances highlighted mirror or echo effects, such as complementary patterns or reciprocities of movement. They never presented man and woman in conflict or created tension through competing configurations of bodily rhythm. The pieces tended toward the elegiac and ceremonial; they seemed to express a virtuosic, synchronized cheerfulness rather than a stirring or triumphant happiness. In &quot;Empire of Ecstasy&quot;, author Karl Toepfer posits that they exhibited &quot;reluctance to build dramatic tension between each other in relation to a source of conflict—the music, the musician, or the man... and precisely because they pursued such divergent ambitions that they could not long remain a dance couple.&quot; In 1931, they toured for the last time.

Their best-known pieces included &quot;Fahnentanz&quot;, a quintessential mirror dance. The duo was costumed in vaguely Roman garb: centurion-like helmets, tunic/skirts and large capes, which they waved as flags in rapid, swirling motions. &quot;Hymnis&quot;, with music by Lully, was a somber, ceremonial piece. &quot;Pavane&quot;, set to music by Ravel, was danced with even greater gravity. Georgi and Kreutzberg wore glowing white costumes as they moved slowly and mournfully through the dark space. Another slow piece, &quot;Persiches Lied&quot; (music by Satie), was performed in striking Oriental costumes. The dancers met in the space and coiled about each other with matching movements, finally sinking to the floor embracing and covered with a veil.

Kreutzberg and Georgi&#x27;s 1931 Berlin performance, to Gustav Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot;, was one of the largest pair concerts ever staged. The piece employed a monumental abstract set consisting of a row of dark, cave-like entrances from which emerged spiraling ramps and towering, slanting walls. Though often separated in space, the couple remained united through complementary movement. In the comedic &quot;Potpourri&quot;, they wore polka dot costumes and clowned around on stage with pianist, Wilckens, interrupting his efforts to start the music by hovering over him and striking their own dissonant chords. They snatched up sticks and cavorted with them like children, until Wilckens, exasperated, crept away with the music, compelling the dancers to follow him offstage.

In the U.S., critics praised Georgi, but gushed over Kreutzberg, &quot;It is more inspiring to see him merely walk upon the stage with his singularly lithe and detached movement than to witness a whole evening&#x27;s performance by the average male dancer. Mr. Kreutzberg combines a grave and incisive intelligence with a powerful gift of projection, a clear vision with a lively imagination, and all of these with a splendid physique and a technical facility which is actually lustrous.&quot;

Portraits of Kreutzberg and Georgi, together and alone, were printed on cigarette cards distributed as part of Cigarettenfabrik Orami&#x27;s &quot;Famous Dancers (Series E)&quot; cards. Anna Pavlova, Josephine Baker, Mary Wigman, Rudolf von Laban, Anton Dolin and Ted Shawn were also in this collection.

==Partnership with Ruth Page==

After touring with Georgi, Kreutzberg was involved in a number of brief dance partnerships: Elisabeth Grube, Tilly Losch and Ilse Meudtner. In 1930, he and Wilckens met Ruth Page, an American ballerina, aboard the &quot;Aquitania&quot;. The three hit it off immediately, forming a friendship and &quot;artistic ménage a trois&quot; that would last for decades. 
In 1933, Page and Kreutzberg launched a &quot;new and rather surprising partnership.&quot; Though the pairing of an American ballet dancer with an exponent of German modern dance seemed an unlikely collaboration, but the arrangement provided both artists with a number of advantages. Page, who lived in Chicago outside the dance mecca of New York, acquired a modernist, cosmopolitan aura as well as the musical support of Wilckens. Kreutzberg gained access to new performance venues and an escape from rising fascism and homophobic militancy at home. Both dancers capitalized on their contrasting, yet complimentary, personas.

They performed their first joint concert on February 25, 1933, at the Studebaker Theater in Chicago. Each danced two or three solos, then performed a duet together, a format similar to the one Kreutzberg and Georgi had used. He retained his usual repertoire of solos and refashioned his dances with Georgi to fit Page. Their U.S. tour in 1933 was so successful, they repeated it the following year, then continued on to Japan and China in 1934.

Among their most popular offerings were &quot;Country Dance&quot;, a folk ballet of sorts, with peasant-style polka dot costumes featuring bonnets and puffed sleeves; &quot;Promenade&quot;, set to music by Poulenc, a gender fluid number in which elegant, tapering hands and a demure attitude were prevalent; and &quot;Bolero&quot;, a dance of &quot;fiery, forbidden desire&quot; that played to sold-out houses, won long ovations from the audience and was lauded in the press. &quot;Bacchanale&quot;, music by Gian Francesco Malipiero, highlighted the experimental, advant garde facet of their collaboration. The austere, Futurist-inspired work was characterized by repeated falls, off-kilter weight distribution and unusual supports. The couple sometimes danced back to back with arms interlaced. Page wore a black dress, Kreutzberg a black shirt and pants. Both wore black elastic bands around their arms and white elastic bands crisscrossing their faces and looping around their necks and heads.

The pair&#x27;s partnership ultimately dissolved. Kreutzberg may have felt he could best showcase his talents in one-man shows. Page had been appointed ballet director for the Chicago Grand Opera Company for the 1934–35 season. In addition, her partnership with Chicago-based ballet dancer Bentley Stone had become more satisfying. After 1936, as increasing numbers of American artists broke ties with those working in Nazi Germany, it became untenable for Page to continue touring with the German artist. In 1939, the German government revoked Kreutzberg&#x27;s travel privileges; all scheduled appearances were canceled. Nonetheless, Kreutzberg and Page remained friends, corresponding frequently from 1939 through the postwar years.

Page remembered her years with Kreutzberg as the happiest time in her life. &quot;Dancing with Kreutzberg was like dancing with a disembodied spirit – the spirit of dance itself.&quot; Along with Anna Pavlova, she regarded, Kreutzberg as one of the &quot;greatest influences&quot; on her career. Page wrote Kreutzberg&#x27;s eulogy, published in &quot;Dance Magazine&quot; in 1968.

== The Dancing Ambassador of National Socialist Germany ==

The rise of National Socialism had a profound effect on Ausdruckstanz. Many dancers remained in Germany and collaborated with the Nazis; others went into exile due to their leftist politics and/or Jewish heritage. Kreutzberg was one of a handful of dancers who maintained a good relationship with the Ministry of Propaganda. He understood what role to play so he could continue dancing. In the 1920s and 1930s, Kreutzberg&#x27;s productions took on a heightened sense of nationalism. This aspect of his work proved to his advantage since it mirrored the regime&#x27;s core ideology.

Kreutzberg reached the peak of his career during World War II. In September 1937, he was the featured dancer at German Art Week during the Paris International Exhibition. In 1939, he appeared at the Day of German Art in Munich. His performance schedule followed the advance of Nazi conquests and alliances. In May 1940, The Netherlands fell to the Reich; in July of that year, he gave recitals at the Kurhaus Kurzaal Theater in The Hague. In her book &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Dancers&quot;, author Marion Kant refers to Kreutzberg as &quot;the dancing ambassador of National Socialist Germany.&quot;

In 1941, the performance pattern of the previous year was repeated. In the summer, Kreutzberg performed at the Kurhaus; in autumn, a tour was organized on his behalf. The 1943 shows were held under the auspices of the German Theater in The Netherlands. From 1942 to 1944 opera, dance and music concerts were organized in different Dutch cities, intended for members of the Wehrmacht. Members of the general public were welcome to attend and critics to write reviews in the press.

News of Kreutzberg&#x27;s recitals were deployed in different media for propaganda purposes. In The Netherlands, for example, Polygoon Journaal, a weekly newscast shown in Dutch cinemas, included a four-minute clip of Kreutzberg walking on Scheveningen beach and dancing with two local girls (November 22, 1940). &quot;Signal&quot;, a Wehrmacht-funded Dutch newspaper, published a full-color photo of Kreutzberg as Till Eulenspiegel in the same year.

While many gay male dancers continued careers under the National Socialist government, Kreutzberg was the most notable as his long-term partnership with Wilckens was an open secret. While other gay men were imprisoned and forced to wear pink triangles, Kreutzberg was encouraged to tour throughout Germany and abroad.

===The Berlin Olympics of 1936===

The Reich&#x27;s Tanzfestspiele (dance festivals) were a prelude to the Olympic Games of 1936. Seeking to establish guidelines for &quot;acceptable dance&quot; and &quot;advance a homogeneous, unified political and aesthetic ideology,&quot; Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels hosted the first Deutsche Tanzfestspiele in 1934. It became an annual event through the Berlin Olympics.

For Nazi Germany, the games were a perfect opportunity to showcase official ideology and demonstrate national strength. The inclusion of dance, as well as other new events, was solicited by the organizers as a means to include areas in which Germany was strong. None of the proposed inclusions were approved, however, the International Olympic Committee in Germany sent invitations to the world&#x27;s most notable dancers to take part in an international dance competition. Recently-appointed German Master of the Studio for Dance, von Laban organized and coordinated the event. Kreutzberg and Wigman were charged with assisting him. All three were to choreograph pieces that conformed to and celebrated Nazi ideology.

After seeing the dress rehearsal of Laban&#x27;s work, &quot;Vom Tauwind und der neuen Freunde&quot; (Spring Wind and New Joy), Goebbels rejected it on the grounds it was &quot;a poorly choreographed piece, one that was intellectual, and had nothing whatever to do with Germans.&quot; Kreutzberg&#x27;s dance, set to music by Werner Egk, apparently set the proper tone. The performance took place in the stadium&#x27;s center under a &quot;temple of light,&quot; an effect produced by massed searchlights under Albert Speer&#x27;s direction. The theme (an allusion to the Spartans&#x27; sacrifice at Thermopylae), &quot;The country&#x27;s greatest gift – to die willingly for it when necessary,&quot; was suggested by the Games&#x27; organizer Carl Diem.

Kreutzberg&#x27;s portion of the extravaganza, called &quot;Waffentanz&quot; (Weapons Dance) or, alternatively, &quot;Swerttanz&quot; (Sword Dance), was more a theatrical representation than a dance. It began with 60 young men, representing two opposing, sword-wielding phalanxes, storming the stadium like a &quot;wild horde&quot; (&quot;New Prussian Newspaper&quot;, 1936) and shouting hostile cries. A mock battle ensued, resulting in the fall of one phalanx and a triumphant celebration by the other. The fallen troops remained in the field while the winners departed celebrating their victory. Kreutzberg&#x27;s solo followed, ending with the dancer&#x27;s heroic death by sword. Wigman&#x27;s &quot;Totenklage&quot; (Death Lament) concluded the Germans&#x27; performance. Olympic medals were awarded to both Kreutzberg&#x27;s and Wigman&#x27;s troupes.

None of this spectacle appears in Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s documentary masterpiece &quot;Olympia&quot;, because she and her cameramen did not think they had enough light to shoot the scene.

===Paracelsus===

In 1943, when Germany seemed certain to lose the war, Kreutzberg appeared as Der Gaulker (The Juggler) Fliegenbein in G. W. Pabst&#x27;s propaganda film &quot;Paracelsus&quot;. In the story, Paracelsus (as a stand-in for Hitler) keeps the plague out of Basel by barring entry to the city. During an attempt by a greedy merchant to smuggle in goods, Fliegenbein, attached to the caravan, slips inside the city walls. Already infected, he escapes to a nearby tavern.

In a brief (approximately 65 second), brilliantly-choreographed, hypnotic Totentanz, Kreutzberg performs a sequence that &quot;ranks with the best ballet ever put on celluloid.&quot; His movements are defined by ambiguity and disorder. He advances, then retreats, slowly hopping, at first, then stiffly marching, eyes glazed, slapping thighs, hips and shoulders. He leads, but does not acknowledge, the mesmerized tavern patrons who follow his display of confused distress and an energy that swings between manic and sickly. The scene evokes historical 16th century &quot;dance epidemics&quot; in which the participants are swept up in a frenzied, mimetic fever.

===Military service===
In 1944, Kreutzberg was drafted into the German Army, but Americans soon captured him on the Italian front. He spent two and half months in a prisoner of war camp. In a letter to a friend, he wrote he had a &quot;good time,&quot; there, performing scenes from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and playing Mephisto in selections from &quot;Faust&quot;. When he was released, he returned to Germany and resumed his international career.

==Solo career and other postwar projects==
From 1936 forward, Kreutzberg performed primarily as a soloist. Touted by some as the &quot;new Nijinsky&quot;, Kreutzberg&#x27;s style was influenced, in part by ballet, but was dominated by a modern aesthetic characterized by sharp, angular and twisting motions. The solos primarily fell into two categories: charming and humorous character dances that frequently used pantomimic gestures and grotesque masks, and transcendental dances that conveyed emotional states. The works ranged from the tragic allegory of &quot;The Angel Lucifer&quot; to the comic grotesquerie of &quot;The Wedding Bouquet&quot;. Even in his most serious performances, Kreutzberg cultivated the image of a jester, a medieval fool or demonic acrobat.

His distinctive choreography combined free dance movements with elements of theater such as mime and pictorial costuming. Similarly to Martha Graham, he created most of his costumes. There are numerous photographs of the inventive garments: the rope noose wrapped around his calf for &quot;Hangman&#x27;s Dance on the Grave of His Victim,&quot; the futuristic cage-like headgear worn in the &quot;King&#x27;s Dance&quot;, and the string line drawing on his jacket in &quot;Three Hungarian Dances&quot;.

Kreutzberg performed solos in the U.S. in the early 30s, and again in 1937, 1947, 1948 and 1953. &quot;The New York Times&quot; dance critic John Martin, who was a fan and follower of Kreutzberg&#x27;s since his first U.S. appearances, was instrumental in rehabilitating his image after World War II, exonerating him as &quot;a victim of circumstance.&quot; In an article for &quot;Time&quot;, Martin wrote, somewhat disingenuously, of the dancer&#x27;s wartime record, &quot;[Kreutzberg] danced a few recitals in his native Austria, but mainly he says, tried to keep out of sight: &#x27;I just appeared, then disappeared.&#x27;

Postwar, Kreutzberg maintained his status as the doyen of German modern dance. He was the first German artist to go on foreign tours, performing in the U.S., South America and Israel in 1948. Choreographer George Balanchine and writer Lincoln Kirstein invited him to share a program with the New York City Ballet in the late 1940s. He toured through Switzerland, France, Scandinavia. Austria, Hungary and The Netherlands every other year (1950, 1952 and 1954). His last performance in The Netherlands was in 1958. In 1965, at Page&#x27;s invitation, his last U.S. appearance was with Lyric Opera of Chicago in a production of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. He danced the role of Death.

He was cast in character roles in the Italian-West German film &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1959) as Sir Agamemnon, and in the West German TV movies &quot;Annoncentheater – Ein Abendprogramm des deutschen Fernsehens im Jahre&quot; (1962) as Artist and &quot;Das Kabinett des Professor Enslen&quot; (1964) as Professor Enslen.

Kreutzberg made a rare U.S. TV appearance in the 1960s, when he was featured in the dual roles of Drosselmeyer and the Snow King, in a heavily abridged West German-American production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. It aired on CBS in 1965 and was repeated several times afterward, but was superseded in 1977 by the full-length Baryshnikov version.

In 1955, he established a dance school in Bern, Switzerland. After retiring from the stage in 1959, he choreographed for others and continued to teach until his death on April 25, 1968.

===Repertory===
Some of Kreutzberg&#x27;s best-known solos are listed below, notes on music, costumes and critical reception are included where known. 
*&quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot;, choreographed for a production of Gozzi&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, set to music by Cyril Scott. The costume designed by Kreutzberg consisted of a dark Oriental gown, long scarf and large tassel earrings. His makeup included a large round dot applied to his bald forehead. &quot;He did a thousand things with his hands and the straight blue-lined silver scarf across his shoulders. He made his master of ceremonies everything from a silly slave to ceremony to a tragic power.&quot;
*&quot;Jester&#x27;s Dance&quot; from &quot;Don Morte&quot; &quot;an excellent composition in the narrative-dramatic vein, the story of a jester frantically and futilely attempting to escape the mask which he is doomed to wear. The gesture with which he forces his head into the mask is replete with a significance which can be communicated only in terms of movement. It cannot be recorded in words.
*&quot;Dance through the Streets&quot;, set to music by Isaac Albéniz, is a &quot;graceful bit of mannered art, [that] represents him [as] best in his field. There is fantasy in this. It is pleasant to watch and extremely clever.&quot;
*&quot;Angel of the Annunciation&quot;, a dance that embodies &quot;beauty of design, fascinating flow and sweep of movement combined with an impressive austerity of mood to make a work of art that was satisfying in all respects.
*&quot;Three Mad Figures,&quot; Kreutzberg impersonates inmates of an insane asylum, conjuring up the Expressionistic aura of the German horror film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;. American audiences found this piece especially disturbing. From the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, &quot;studies in insanity with the artificial assistance of flashing lights and screams offstage.&quot; Critics in the Midwest did not like it any better, &quot;terrible,&quot; proclaimed the &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot; critic. &quot;The first, an idiot with a flower, the picture painted while minor scales wandered as aimlessly about as the dancer, made one feel as if one were becoming simple oneself and awfulness is piled upon that imbecility until one feels like screaming.&quot;
*&quot;Hangman&#x27;s Dance on the Grave of his Victim&quot; was described by &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; critic as a &quot;sadistic grotesquerie,&quot; while the reviewer for &quot;The Arizona Daily Star&quot; wrote &quot;he stamps and beats with his hands and seems even with the weight of his body to trample down the victim that he has hanged becomes (sic) a study in rage and hate.&quot; Photos depicting this dance show Kreutzberg in a costume that features a rope noose wrapped around his lower leg.
*&quot;Orpheus Lament for Euridice&quot;, music by Wilckens, &quot;one of the finest bits of solo work comes in the latter part...after he (Orpheus) has dismissed the maidens who seek to comfort him. He stands the picture of tragedy and dejection as the maidens drift from the stage...As the last trailing drapery floats from vision, the figure of Kreutzberg becomes galvanized into life and seizing the robe of his dead wife...gives vent to his grief in a series of dance figures which are a veritable delirium of desolation and longing and at the close of which he falls exhausted.&quot; This review is from a tour Kreutzberg traveled with a troupe of four female dancers. 
*&quot;Vagabond&#x27;s Song&quot; was a work of &quot;lighthearted gaiety&quot; set to music by Bedřich Smetana. According to the &quot;Times Colonist&quot; reviewer, &quot;&quot;Vagabond&#x27;s Song&quot; [was] full of joie-de-vivre, and ranging in mood from the wistful to a gay, youthful abandon expressed in great leaps and somersaults.&quot; 
*&quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot;, music by Wilckens, &quot;was clever and amusing, but showed only the softer side of that inimitable German rogue.&quot; From program notes on a Canadian tour, &quot;A cape gives him the opportunity of many configurations. Sometimes he becomes a gnome, sometimes a lame old woman, then again a cavalier, and then a bashful girl.&quot; 
*&quot;King&#x27;s Dance&quot;, set to music by Max Reger, &quot;golden swinging spirals surround the powerful movements of a tyrannical figure whose expression is that of sovereign splendor and despotic imperiousness.&quot; For this work Kreutzberg wore a red tunic with a wide round gold collar, gold cropped flare-legged trousers, a gold cape attached at the wrists and an elaborate headdress of gold orbits. This dance was often the opening number for North American concerts, &quot;as if to distance the performer from the madman and violent events in Germany.&quot;
*&quot;Songs of Death&quot; was possibly a sketch for the later work &quot;The Eternal Circle.&quot; The dance consisted of three sections: &quot;Amaroso, where death comes kindly; Majestoso, where death stalks triumphantly; and Furioso, the terrible death of a cripple.&quot; Another critic interpreted the piece slightly differently, &quot;death&#x27;s simulation to sleep was first portrayed, then with the shedding of the funereal black garb to reveal a scarlet tunic, he dramatized death in its more violent form, concluding with a majestic gesture and a haunting, sardonic laugh.&quot;
*&quot;The Eternal Circle: A Legend of Death&quot;, music by Wilckens. In this ballet, &quot;for it can be called by no other name,&quot; the sinister, commanding figure of Death makes a visit to earth, leaving behind his black robe as a symbol of his kingdom among the living. &quot;All who fall within that fatal circle die as they have lived... the drunkard, the vain man, the criminal, the king, the wanton and the invalid,&quot; each character &quot;impersonated by Kreutzberg, who makes use of astonishingly impressive masks.&quot; &quot;Each figure stands out like those in the medieval woodcuts of the dance of death.&quot; After the war, Kreutzberg made a film of &quot;The Eternal Circle.&quot; It was seldom shown as it was thought to be cursed. After its German premiere, the projectionist died. On its second showing, the theater caught fire.

==Influence and legacy==
Early in his career, Kreutzberg aligned himself to an expressionistic approach to dance. He remained faithful to that aesthetic until the end of his life. That devotion, however, always accommodated his acute awareness of what pleased audiences. In that regard, he was an important influence in moving modern dance to a global, popular level.

Without doubt, Kreutzberg was a study in contradictions: an artistic revolutionary, while at the same time an ally of the National Socialist regime. Defenders characterize him as apolitical, committed only to his art, though he continued his career uninterrupted under the Nazis and allowed himself to be used as a poster boy for their cultural propaganda. He was one of the most esteemed and highly paid artists in Nazi Germany despite being homosexual and despite the fact he unabashedly presented gender bending modern work. Kreutzberg incorporated feminine movements and costuming in his performances and challenged the stereotypical male roles of princes and mythical gods.

When asked by a reporter to disclose his theory of dance, Kreutzberg responded: &quot;You must understand that we know technique, in fact are grounded in it, but as soon as we have achieved a certain amount of body control and physical gymnastics of movement, we project our minds into the dance and make our bodies express what we feel. Thus, the technique is submerged and made an unconscious undercurrent. Color, costume, music – all are consciously used only so far as they portray the emotion of the dance.&quot; To another interviewer, he described his role as that of &quot;storyteller and painter.&quot;

As his contribution to Ausdruckstanz swept Europe, his work was impacting U.S. dancers as well. Erick Hawkins and José Limón considered him a major force in the development of the male modern dancer at a time when women &quot;pioneers&quot; were more abundant. He was critical link in the aesthetic lineage that gave rise to American choreographer/composer Alwin Nikolais and choreographer/dance educator Hanya Holm.

In 1933, Helene von Taussig published a book of twenty-four charcoal drawings of Kreutzberg dancing. The minimalist motion studies portray bodily movement rather than physical features as the most important attribute of the dancer&#x27;s persona. Taussig attempts to capture, in a few broad strokes, an image of muscularity, emotional turbulence and rapturous action: leaping, running and twisting with arms spread, thrusting or propelling.

He was the subject of three documentaries made for German television: the short &quot;Große Tänzer&quot; (1955), a full-length documentary &quot;Harald Kreutzberg – Errinerungen eines Tänzers&quot; (1961) and a two-part series &quot;Harald Kreutzberg&quot;: &quot;Part 1, Bilder und Tänze&quot; and &quot;Part 2, Die Kreis&quot; (also 1961).

Kreutzberg&#x27;s original dances are almost never performed, however at the 2012 American Dance Guild Festival, John Pennington offered a reconstruction of the 1927 solo &quot;Dances Before God&quot;.

DanceLab Berlin premiered an homage, &quot;H.K. – Quintett&quot;, in 2015. The choreographers looked at three core questions from Kreutzberg&#x27;s biography: &quot;How does identity develop between individuality and uniformity? What do the terms &#x27;masculine&#x27; and &#x27;feminine&#x27; mean, in light of the gender debate? And what is the role of the male dancer today?&quot; Rather than reconstruct Kreutzberg&#x27;s original pieces, the choreographers worked with five dancers to isolate gestures from Kreutzberg&#x27;s movement vocabulary and combine them with contemporary movement.

<text>Dorothy Fay (born Dorothy Alice Fay Southworth, April 4, 1915 – November 5, 2003) was an American actress mainly known for her appearances in Western movies.

==Early life and career==
She was born Dorothy Fay Southworth in Prescott, Arizona, the daughter of Harry T. Southworth and Harriet Fay Fox. Her father was a medical doctor. Fay attended the Caroline Leonetti School, the University of London, and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. She also studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.

==Career==
Fay began her motion picture career in the late 1930s, performing in several B grade westerns. In 1938, she appeared opposite George Houston in &quot;Frontier Scout&quot; at Grand National Pictures. She also appeared with Western stars Buck Jones and William Elliott.

Fay made four movies with her husband, country singer and actor Tex Ritter, at Monogram Pictures: &quot;Song of the Buckaroo&quot; (1938), &quot;Sundown on the Prairie&quot; (1939), &quot;Rollin&#x27; Westward&quot; (1939) and &quot;Rainbow Over the Range&quot; (1940). She played a heroine in &quot;The Green Archer&quot; (1940) and &quot;White Eagle&quot; (1941), both at Columbia Pictures. Fay also made a few small appearances in other genres, such as the crime drama &quot;Missing Daughters&quot; (1939). In 1940, she asked Monogram to give her a different part and was loaned to MGM for a small role in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, which starred Cary Grant, James Stewart, and Katharine Hepburn. She also appeared as a debutante in the MGM musical &quot;Lady Be Good&quot; (1941) starring Ann Sothern, Eleanor Powell, Robert Young and Lionel Barrymore.

==Later years==
Fay married singer/actor Tex Ritter on June 14, 1941. Fay made several more movies after she and Ritter married, but then retired from show business in late 1941. In 1965, she and Ritter moved to Nashville, Tennessee, because of his singing and recording career. For a time, she was an official greeter at the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;. On January 2, 1974, Ritter suffered a fatal heart attack (the family now suspects a dissecting aortic aneurysm) in Nashville. Fay and Ritter had been married 32 years and had two sons; Thomas and the late comedic actor John Ritter. 

Fay returned to Southern California in 1981. She turned down several offers to return to movie work, including an opportunity to appear on the ABC television series &quot;The Love Boat&quot; playing the mother of real-life son, John. But she did appear with him in the TV special &quot;Superstars and their Moms&quot; in 1987. She was also a frequent guest at western movie conventions.

In 1987, Fay suffered a stroke that impacted her speech. She moved to the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, in 1989. In August 2001, she was mistakenly reported to have died by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper in London. The error happened when an employee at the retirement home found that Fay was not in her room, and after inquiring about her absence, was told that Fay had &quot;gone&quot;, by which it was meant that she had left her room and was in another wing of the building. However, the employee mistook this as meaning she had died, and telephoned a friend — who happened to work at the &quot;Telegraph&quot;″s obituaries desk — with the supposed &quot;news&quot;. Fay and her family found the blunder amusing and took it in good sport.

==Death==
Fay died of natural causes at the age of 88 at the Motion Picture and Television Home in Woodland Hills, California, less than two months after the death of her son, John. She is interred with her parents at Mountain View Cemetery in her hometown of Prescott, Arizona. Tex Ritter is interred at Oak Bluff Memorial Park in Port Neches, Texas. John Ritter is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California.

<text>Sir Samuel Romilly (1 March 1757 – 2 November 1818) was a British lawyer, Whig politician, abolitionist and legal reformer. Born in London of French Huguenot descent, he was largely self-educated and escaped poverty through a fortuitous inheritance that allowed travel. From a background in the commercial world, Romilly became well-connected, and rose to public office as Solicitor-General for England and Wales (1806–1807) and a prominent position in Parliament, where he sat for Horsham (1807–1808), Wareham (1808–1812), Arundel (1812–1818), and finally Westminster (July 1818 until his death).

After an early interest in radical politics, he built a career in chancery cases, and then turned to reform of British criminal law and abolition of the slave trade. The grandson of refugees, he became known as a &quot;friend of the oppressed&quot;. Yet few of his ambitions were achieved during his lifetime, which was cut short in 1818, when, despondent after the death of his wife, he died by suicide, leaving criminal law &quot;in the same state as he had found it when he embarked upon his work of amelioration&quot;. He was an early campaigner against the death penalty, which was partially realised on the bicentennial of his birth with the Homicide Act 1957.

His eldest son, John, was Attorney General for England and Wales and was ennobled as Baron Romilly in 1866. Three other sons, Frederick Romilly, Edward Romilly, and Charles Romilly, were first-class cricketers.

==Early life ==
===Family origin===
Romilly was born on Frith Street in Soho, London, into a French-speaking Huguenot family who had fled France after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. He was the second surviving son of Pierre (Peter) Romilly, a watchmaker and jeweller, and his wife, Marguerite (Margaret) Garnault, daughter of Aymé Garnault, another Huguenot jeweller, whose father left Châtellerault in Poitou. Isaac Romilly was his father&#x27;s elder brother. 

His paternal grandfather, Étienne (Stephen) Romilly, emigrated from Montpellier to Hoxton in 1701 via Geneva. He married Judith de Montsallier. Étienne&#x27;s father, who owned a large estate in Montpellier, helped him financially, and he set up a firm in Hoxton as a wax bleacher and was able to comfortably support his large family and business interests. However, when his father died in France, a Catholic relative inherited the estate and slashed his income to a paltry amount, and ultimately he was left bankrupt, unable to cover his expenses. Remembered for his generosity and his piety, Étienne died in 1733, aged 49, &quot;of a broken heart&quot; according to Samuel&#x27;s memoirs. He left a widow and eight children, the youngest of whom died within a few months and was buried in his father&#x27;s grave. Samuel&#x27;s father, Pierre, was the youngest surviving child.

===Education and upbringing===

Pierre and Marguerite Romilly married in 1744. They had six children who died young: Michel Pierre (April 1744 – December 1744), Marguerite (born 1745), Sarah (1746–1747), Anne (born 1747–1748), Mary (1749–1755), and Judith (born 1752), followed finally by three surviving children, Thomas Peter (17 June 1753 – 7 December 1828), Catherine (born 14 February 1755) and lastly Samuel. Pierre blamed the deaths of his children on the unhealthy atmosphere of the city of London. They moved to Soho and then moved again to the High Street in Marylebone – at the time a small village a mile from the city.

His mother was in poor health, and Samuel and his siblings were largely raised by a maternal relative, Margaret Facquier, who educated the children mainly with the Bible, the 18th-century moralist periodical &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and an English translation of François Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque&quot;. For awhile he attended a school run by a Mr. Flack, which he hated, and his formal education ended at age 14.

Every Sunday, his family attended the French Protestant Chapel in Soho, where his future brother-in-law, John (Jean) Roget from Geneva, was pastor. (Roget and Samuel&#x27;s sister Catherine were the parents of Peter Mark Roget). Roget introduced Romilly to the works of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and he became a follower. Self-taught from then on, Romilly became a good classical scholar and was conversant with French literature.

Romilly&#x27;s first cousin once removed Sir Samuel Fludyer, 1st Baronet, M.P., was his godfather and namesake, and he had prospects for entering Fludyer&#x27;s successful wool business. He had a clerkship learning bookkeeping, but Sir Samuel died in 1768, followed by his brother and partner, Sir Thomas Fludyer, in 1769, and the opportunity fell away. 

However, good fortune entered his life in a generous benefactor, his great-uncle Philip Delahaize (or de la Haize; brother of his grandmother Marguerite Alavoine Garnault). Delahaize also died in 1769, when Samuel was 12 years old. Delahaize &quot;was a gentleman of great wealth and benevolence, and by his judicious bequests to his circle of relations he set a number of refugee families upon their feet in a nation in which their ancestors had retired to voluntary poverty.&quot; He left £2,000 () each to Samuel and his brother, and £3,000 each () to his parents and sister.

Romilly was articled in 1773 to William Michael Lally, a solicitor who worked in the Six Clerks office of the Court of Chancery. However, after five years, when it became possible for Romilly to purchase a post there, he turned down the opportunity.

==Legal career==
In 1778, Romilly decided on a career as barrister, and entered Gray&#x27;s Inn. He was a pupil of Jeffries Spranger, an equity draughtsman. Called to the bar in 1783, he went the Midland circuit, but was mostly occupied with chancery practice. His practice at the chancery bar grew, and in 1800 he was made a King&#x27;s Counsel. In 1805 he was appointed chancellor of the county palatine of Durham.

==Travels and associations, radical period==
===First continental tour===
In the legal vacation of 1781, Romilly made a tour in France and Switzerland. He had the family connection with Geneva, through John Roget, now his brother-in-law. Roget, who died in 1783, moved back there for his health, and Romilly brought out the young Peter Mark Roget to be reunited with his parents. In Geneva, Romilly also met Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont. Staying for a period with David Chauvet, one of the progressive group of local politicians, Romilly met the like-minded Etienne Clavière, among others.

A friend from the Paris leg of this visit was Marguerite Madeleine Delessert, later Madame Gautier. Her mother was Madeleine Catherine Boy de La Tour, who married Etienne Delessert. Marguerite became the wife of the Genevan banker Jean-Antoine Gautier, who moved to Paris. Romilly stayed at the Delessert home in Passy.

===Second continental tour===
In 1783, immediately after being called to the bar, Romilly made a second tour. This time he was accompanied in France by John Baynes, and met Benjamin Franklin at Passy, to whom Baynes had an introduction from John Jebb. In Lausanne he met the Abbé Raynal.

In the meantime, the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782 had occurred. Romilly was introduced in 1784 to Honoré Mirabeau, by the Genevan writer François d&#x27;Ivernois, as his &quot;Memoirs&quot; state; Halevy says it was through Thomas Brand Hollis. D&#x27;Ivernois and Dumont formed part of the group of the revolution&#x27;s leaders who by then were exiles in London. Mirabeau saw him daily for a long time.

===Bowood circle===
William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne (later the Marquess of Lansdown), Prime Minister in 1782–1783, invited Romilly to Bowood House, around 1784–5. He had heard Romilly&#x27;s name from Mirabeau, had read the pamphlet &quot;A Fragment on the Constitutional Power and Duty of Juries upon Trials for Libels&quot; by Romilly, and was interested in Dumont.

In what has been called the Bowood circle, Jeremy Bentham, with whom Romilly was acquainted, became a friend, and he had much to do with Benjamin Vaughan, another friend.

===French Revolution and its era===
In 1789, Romilly visited Paris, and studied the course of the French Revolution there, also visiting the dungeon at Vincennes where Mirabeau had been confined. When Mirabeau became a political leader, it was to Romilly that he applied for an account of the procedure used in the House of Commons of Great Britain. He left France with less optimism about the politics of the Revolution.

Romilly&#x27;s abilities were recognized by the Whig party. The Marquess of Lansdowne offered him in 1792 the parliamentary seat of Calne, which Romilly turned down. In July 1793 he defended Birmingham booksellers who had sold Tom Paine&#x27;s works, despite thinking Paine was lacking in arguments; and in August of that year attended the sedition trial of Thomas Muir, which he regarded as shocking.

By the end of 1793, Romilly had concluded that French revolutionary politics amounted to &quot;barbarism&quot;. He explained in 1794 to his correspondent Madame Gautier that &quot;public events&quot; had brought about his change of views. In August 1797 he secured the acquittal of the radical John Binns for treason.

During the 1802 Peace of Amiens, Romilly was in Paris. He visited the Palais Bourbon, where the Legislative Assembly met, with Bentham.

==Political career==
In 1806, on the accession of the Ministry of All the Talents to office, Romilly was offered the post of Solicitor General, although he had never sat in the House of Commons. He accepted, was knighted, and was brought into parliament for Queenborough. He went out of office with the government, but remained in the House of Commons, sitting successively for Horsham, Wareham and Arundel. Romilly&#x27;s reforming efforts made his reputation. In 1818, he was returned at the head of the poll for the city of Westminster. He had not much longer to live.

===Abolitionist===

Romilly was a vocal opponent of the slave trade. His interest came early in life, by the time of his meeting in 1783 with the Abbé Raynal, whose &quot;Histoire des deux Indes&quot; he had read. He gave his support to William Wilberforce&#x27;s abolition campaign.

During the parliamentary debate on the Slave Trade Bill, Romilly paid tribute to Wilberforce, saying that his leadership had &quot;preserved so many millions of his fellow creatures.&quot; As he concluded his remarks, Romilly was greeted with a standing ovation by other Members of Parliament, a reaction that very rarely occurred in the House of Commons. Wilberforce himself sat with his head in his hands, tears streaming down his face.

===Legal reformer===

Romilly worked to reform the criminal law, under the influence of what is now called Classical criminology. He spent a dozen years of his life on the passage through Parliament of legislative reforms. He argued against the attitudes to punishments of Martin Madan and William Paley. The so-called Bloody Code of justice was, in his view, something that required reform, while, as he stated in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, one effect of the French Revolution was to lessen the chances of Parliament passing the necessary legislation. The tide of opinion, however, was beginning to turn.

In 1808, Romilly managed to repeal the Elizabethan statute which made it a capital offence to steal from the person. Successful prosecutions of pickpockets then rose. Charles Williams-Wynn, on the other hand, saw Romilly&#x27;s background in equity law, and discrete bills, as inadequate.

In 1809, three bills for repealing draconian statutes were thrown out by the House of Lords under the influence of Lord Ellenborough. Romilly saw further bills rejected; but in March 1812 he had repealed a statute of Elizabeth I making it a capital offence for a soldier or a mariner to beg without a pass from a magistrate or his commanding officer.

In 1813, John William Ward found the approach too &quot;philosophical&quot;. Romilly failed to pass a law which would have abolished corruption of blood for all crimes, but in the following year he tried again and succeeded, with the exception of treason and murder. Also in 1814, he succeeded in abolishing hanging, drawing and quartering.

Seeing a connection, Romilly also advocated prison reform in 1811. Here, however, reform in the direction proposed by Jeremy Bentham was thwarted.

==Death==
On 29 October 1818, Lady Romilly died in the Isle of Wight. A few days later, on 2 November 1818, Romilly cut his throat, and died in a few minutes, in his house on Russell Square in London. His nephew Peter Mark Roget attended him in his final moments. His last words were written: &quot;My dear, I wish&quot; ... presumably regarding his late wife. 

Romilly was buried on 11 November 1818 at the parish church of St Michael and All Angels, Knill, Herefordshire, with his wife Ann.

==Family==

<doc id="705492" wikidata="Q7508053" url="?curid=705492" title="Siddhartha of Kundagrama">
<text>Siddhartha was the father of Mahavira (Vardhamana), the 24th Jain Tirthankara. He was a Kshatriya ruler from the Ikshvaku dynasty and the Gaṇa Mukhya of the Nāya clan in Kundagrama, a suburb of Vaishali. He was married to Licchavi princess Trishala (sister of Chetaka of Vaishali).

The parents of Tirthankaras and their mothers in particular are worshipped among Jains and are frequently depicted in paintings and sculpture. According to the second chapter of the Śvētāmbara Ācārāṅga Sūtra, Siddhartha and his family were devotees of Parshvanatha.After his death, Nandivardhana became the gaṇa mukhya of the Nāya Republic.

Siddhartha and Trishala died by observing &quot;Santhara&quot; (fast unto death) when Vardhamana was 28 years of age. Following his parents&#x27; demise, Vardhamana decided to take permission from his uncle Suparshva and elder brother Nandivardhana, who dissuaded him from renouncing worldly life for two more years because he was unable to bear the loss of his parents as well as his brother, Vardhamana.

<doc id="705495" wikidata="Q1066916" url="?curid=705495" title="WS-I Basic Profile">
<text>The WS-I Basic Profile (official abbreviation is BP), a specification from the Web Services Interoperability industry consortium (WS-I), provides interoperability guidance for core Web Services specifications such as SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. The profile uses Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to enable the description of services as sets of endpoints operating on messages.

To understand the importance of WSI-BP, note that it defines a much narrower set of valid services than the full WSDL or SOAP schema. Many common platforms (listed below) support WSI-BP but do not support services outside of it. Compare the WSDL 1.1 specification to the subset permitted in WSI-BP. Also note that WSI-BP generally narrows the SOAP specification. There is a notable exception where WSI expands on the SOAP standard, and that is in adding xml:lang attribute on fault elements. 

==Versions==
*Version 1.0 of this profile was released in early 2004.
*Version 1.1 published in 2006 does not have the same scope as version 1.0. The part of version 1.0 dealing with serialization of envelopes and their representation in messages has been moved to a new profile called Simple Soap Binding Profile (SSBP)
*Version 1.2 was finalized in November 2010. The main new features are the support for MTOM binary attachments and WS-Addressing
*Version 2.0 was also published in November 2010. It uses SOAP 1.2, UDDI 3 and WS-Addressing

==Compliant framework==

Here is a list of frameworks claiming to be compliant with this profile :
*SAP - Sybase Unwired Platform 
*Oracle Weblogic Server 10.3 is Basic Profile compliant as well as WS-I Basic Security Profile compliant

<doc id="705497" wikidata="Q6776109" url="?curid=705497" title="Martin Madan">
<text>Martin Madan (1726 – 2 May 1790) was an English barrister, clergyman and writer, known for his contribution to Methodist music, &#x27;The Lock Hospital Collection,&#x27; and later controversial views on marriage expressed in his book &quot;Thelyphthora&quot;.

==Life==
He was the son of Judith Madan (née Cowper) the poet, and Colonel Martin Madan, and was educated at Westminster School, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in 1746. In 1748 he was called to the bar, and for some time lived a very uninhibited life. He was persuaded to change his ways on hearing a sermon by John Wesley. He took holy orders, and was appointed chaplain to the London Lock Hospital. He was closely connected with the Calvinistic Methodist movement supported by the Countess of Huntingdon, and from time to time acted as an itinerant preacher. He was a first cousin of the poet William Cowper, with whom he had some correspondence on religious matters.

In 1767, much adverse comment was aroused by his support of his friend Thomas Haweis in a controversy arising out of the latter&#x27;s possession of the living of All Saints Church, Aldwincle, Northamptonshire. Madan resigned his chaplainship and retired to Epsom.

He married Jane Hale, daughter of the eminent judge Sir Bernard Hale and his wife Anne Thoresby. They had five children. Jane&#x27;s portrait was painted by Allan Ramsay. She died in 1794.

==Works==
In 1760 Martin Madan published for the Lock Hospital the first edition of the collection of &quot;Psalms and Hymns Extracted from various Authors&quot;. He eventually published 11 editions, his last in 1787. Many of Madan&#x27;s edits contained in those collections came into general use. 

In 1780, Madan raised a storm of opposition by the publication of his &quot;Thelyphthora, or A Treatise on Female Ruin&quot;, in which he advocated polygamy as the remedy for evils he deplored. His arguments were based mainly on scriptural authority; but his book caused many angry replies. Amongst them was &#x27;Anti-Thelyphthora&#x27; by his first cousin, the poet William Cowper, which he published anonymously. A fictional account of this event can be read in &quot;The Winner of Sorrow&quot;, a 2005 novel about the poet by Brian Lynch.

Nineteen attacks on Madan&#x27;s treatise are catalogued by Falconer Madan in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

Among other works was &quot;A New and Literal Translation of Juvenal and Persius&quot; (1789).

<text>Anna Maria Pierangeli (19 June 193210 September 1971), known internationally by the stage name Pier Angeli, was an Italian actress, model and singer. She won the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Actress for her debut role in the 1950 film &quot;Tomorrow Is Too Late&quot;, and subsequently won a Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress for her performance in the American film &quot;Teresa&quot; (1951).

In the United States, Angeli was typecast in &quot;European ingénue&quot; roles, and notably played romantic leading ladies in &quot;The Light Touch&quot; (1951), &quot;The Devil Makes Three&quot; (1952), &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953), &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (1954), and &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956). She was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress for her role opposite Richard Attenborough in the British film &quot;The Angry Silence&quot; (1960). 

Off-screen, Angeli was known for her high-profile romantic affairs with actors Kirk Douglas and James Dean, and later her tumultuous marriage to singer Vic Damone. She died at the age of 39 of a barbiturate overdose. 

Her twin sister, Marisa Pavan, was also an actress.

== Early life ==
Anna Maria Pierangeli was born to Enrichetta (née Romiti) and Luigi Pierangeli in Cagliari, Sardinia in 1932. She had a fraternal twin sister, actress Marisa Pavan. 

Angeli spent World War II in Rome; she was ten when the Nazis occupied Rome, experiencing both food shortages and bomb shelters. She was deeply affected by her experiences during the war, recalling later: &quot;What was in the world, I didn&#x27;t want to know.&quot;

== Career ==
Angeli made her film debut at the age of 16 with Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s Italian film, &quot;Domani è troppo tardi&quot; (1950) after being spotted by director Léonide Moguy and De Sica while studying arts in Rome. Her work was so impressive that she won the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Actress, and caught the eye of MGM producers, who offered her a contract with the studio. 

MGM launched her in &quot;Teresa&quot; (1951), her first American film, which also saw the film debuts of Rod Steiger and John Ericson. Reviews for this performance compared her to Greta Garbo, and she won the New Star of the Year–Actress Golden Globe. Under contract to MGM throughout the 1950s, she appeared in a series of films, including &quot;The Light Touch&quot; with Stewart Granger and &quot;The Devil Makes Three&quot; with Gene Kelly. Plans for a film of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with her and Marlon Brando fell through when a British-Italian production was announced.

While filming &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953), Angeli began a relationship with costar Kirk Douglas. She next appeared in &quot;Sombrero&quot;, in which she replaced an indisposed Ava Gardner, then &quot;Flame and the Flesh&quot; (1954). After discovering Leslie Caron, another European ingénue, MGM lent Angeli to other studios. She went to Warner Bros. for both &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (1954), which marked the debut of Paul Newman, and the French-language musical &quot;Oh No, Mam&#x27;zelle&quot; (&quot;Mam&#x27;zelle Nitouche)&quot;, also 1954), co-starring alongside Fernandel. For Paramount, she was in contention for the role of Anna Magnani&#x27;s daughter in &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot; (1955), but the role went to Marisa Pavan, her twin sister. MGM lent her to Columbia for &quot;Port Afrique&quot; (1956), where she got to showcase her real singing voice. She returned to MGM for &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; (1956) as Paul Newman&#x27;s long-suffering wife (Angeli&#x27;s former lover, James Dean, was to play the starring role, which went to Newman after Dean&#x27;s death). Newman would later say of her: &quot;The most beautiful Italian actress of the century. She was an extremely complex and gifted woman. It was so unfortunate that the roles she was asked to play rarely demanded what I know she had to offer.&quot; She then appeared in &quot;The Vintage&quot; (1957) and finished her MGM contract in &quot;Merry Andrew&quot; (1958) starring alongside Danny Kaye. She was in consideration to play the character of Rima in, &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1959), a character she had long wanted to play. Instead she played the part for the July 1954 issue of Life Magazine, shot by Allan Grant. In 1959, she released an album called &quot;Italia con Pier Angeli&quot; in which she sings in English and Italian. One reviewer called her singing voice &quot;warm and surprisingly rich.&quot; She also continued to be hired for modelling jobs well into the 1960s.

During the 1960s and until 1970, Angeli lived and worked in Britain and Europe, and was often screen-credited under her birth name, Anna Maria Pierangeli. She starred in French, Italian and English-language movies throughout the 1960s. Her performance in &quot;The Angry Silence&quot; (1960), starring alongside her friend Richard Attenborough, was nominated for a Best Foreign Actress BAFTA, and she was reunited with Stewart Granger for &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; (1963), in which she played Lot&#x27;s wife. She had a brief role in the war epic &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965). Angeli worked in Israel, and was top-billed, for &quot;Every Bastard a King&quot; (1968), about events during the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War the previous year. She was under serious consideration for a part in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), but died before shooting began.

==Personal life==
Angeli was fluent in Italian and English, and near fluent in French. She was good friends with Debbie Reynolds, Louis Jourdan, and Richard Attenborough. Because she travelled so much, she encountered many artists throughout her life. For example, In 1960, Angeli met Serge Gainsbourg in a nightclub. On a piece of paper she scribbled in French: &quot;J’adore &#x27;L’eau à la bouche&#x27;, ça me donne l’eau à la bouche,&quot; and slipped it into one of Gainsbourg&#x27;s pockets. He treasured this relic, and her gesture had the effect of motivating him to persevere in romantic songwriting.
According to Kirk Douglas&#x27; autobiography &quot;The Ragman&#x27;s Son,&quot; he and Angeli were engaged in the 1950s after meeting on the set of the film &quot;The Story of Three Loves&quot; (1953). 

===Affair with James Dean===
Angeli also had a passionate romantic relationship with James Dean. They met while she was shooting &quot;The Silver Chalice&quot; (1954) and he was shooting &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955), on an adjoining Warner lot. 

Elia Kazan, the director of &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955), remembered hearing Dean and Angeli loudly having sex in Dean&#x27;s dressing room. 

Much against her will, she was forced to break it off, mainly because her mother was not happy with their relationship because Dean was not Catholic. Angeli would reluctantly marry singer Vic Damone in November 1954. There were rumors that she and Dean secretly still saw each other up until his death; Joe Hyams, in his 1992 biography of Dean, &quot;James Dean: Little Boy Lost&quot;, claims that he visited Dean just as Angeli, then married to Damone, was leaving his home. An Order for the Solemnization of Marriage pamphlet with the name &quot;Pier&quot; lightly penciled in every place the bride&#x27;s name is left blank was found amongst Dean&#x27;s personal effects after his death. She would later say that he was the love of her life: &quot;He is the only man I ever loved deeply as a woman should love a man.&quot; Friends of Angeli have said she never fully recovered from his death and that she had nightmares about him up until her own death.

===Marriage to Vic Damone===
Angeli left Dean and married singer and actor Vic Damone in 1954. Singer and actor Dean Martin performed at their wedding. It was reported by several people who attended the wedding that they saw James Dean, claiming Dean watched the wedding from across the road on his motorcycle, even gunning the engine during the ceremony, although Dean later denied doing anything so &quot;dumb.&quot; 

During their marriage, they appeared as guests on the 17 June 1956 episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. She had one son with Vic Damone; their 1958 divorce was followed by highly publicized court battles for the custody of their only child, son Perry (1955–2014).

===Later life and death===
Angeli next married Italian composer Armando Trovajoli in 1962 with whom she had another son, Howard, in 1963. She and Trovajoli separated in 1969.

In the early 1970s she returned to California after having lived in Britain and Europe throughout the 1960s, and briefly lived with her close friend Debbie Reynolds until she found a little apartment in Beverly Hills. 

On 10 September 1971, at the age of 39, Angeli was found dead of a barbiturate overdose at her home in Beverly Hills. On the day of her death, Angeli had been given an injection of Compazine by her doctor to calm her down (she was unable to sleep and had run out of Doriden which the doctor refused to give her). Death due to anaphylaxis has been suggested; however, it is not supported by the findings of her autopsy. 

Her former lover Kirk Douglas and his wife Anne Buydens were among those who were invited to her funeral. She is interred in the Cimetière des Bulvis in Rueil-Malmaison, Hauts-de-Seine, France.

==Portrayals in popular culture==
Angeli was portrayed by Valentina Cervi in the 2001 TV movie &quot;James Dean&quot;, which depicted her relationship with Dean. In 2015, she was portrayed by Alessandra Mastronardi in the James Dean biopic &quot;Life&quot;. A fictional interpretation of her life can be found in the book, &quot;Anna-Maria Pier Angeli: Une Madone à Babylone.&quot;

<text>Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont (18 January or 18 July 1759 – 29 September 1829), sometimes anglicised as Stephen Dumont, was a Swiss French political writer. He is chiefly remembered as the French editor of the writings of the English philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham.

==Early life==
Dumont was born in Geneva, where his family had been citizens of good repute from the days of Calvin. He was educated for the ministry at the Collège de Genève, and in 1781 was chosen one of the pastors of the city. Then politics suddenly turned the course of his life. He belonged to the liberals or democrats, and the triumph of the aristocratic party, through the interference of the courts of France and Sardinia, made continued residence in Geneva impossible, though he was not among the number of the proscribed. He went to join his mother and sisters in St Petersburg. In this he was probably influenced in part by the example of his townsman Pierre Lefort, the first tutor, minister, and general of the Tsar. At St Petersburg he was for eighteen months pastor of the French church.

==Move to England==
In 1785 he moved to London, the former prime minister Lord Shelburne, who had been created Marquess of Lansdowne the previous year, having invited him to undertake the education of his sons. In 1786, Dumont succeeded Joseph Priestley as Lansdowne&#x27;s librarian. It was at Lansdowne&#x27;s house, where he was treated virtually as member of the family, that he became acquainted with many illustrious men, including Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Lord Holland and Sir Samuel Romilly. With the last of these he formed a close and enduring friendship, which had an important influence on his life and pursuits.

In 1788 Dumont visited Paris with Romilly. During a stay of two months in that city he had almost daily intercourse with Honoré Mirabeau, and a certain affinity of talents and pursuits led to an intimacy between two persons diametrically opposed to each other in habits and in character.

==Editing Bentham==
On his return from Paris Dumont made the acquaintance of Jeremy Bentham. Filled with admiration for Bentham&#x27;s genius, Dumont made it one of the chief objects of his life not merely to translate Bentham into French, but to recast and edit his writings in a form suitable for the ordinary reading public.

Dumont&#x27;s editing was heavy-handed, but necessarily so. According to his own account, all the fundamental ideas and most of the illustrative material were already in Bentham&#x27;s manuscripts; but his task was chiefly to abridge by striking out repeated matter, to supply &quot;lacunae&quot;, to secure uniformity of style, and to improve the French. Bentham&#x27;s writing (whether in English or in French) was notoriously convoluted and impenetrable, and according to one reviewer, writing in 1817, &quot;[i]t is indeed when he speaks by another’s lips, that he appears to most advantage; and it to the graces of style which Mr Dumont has given him that he owes the reputation which he has acquired, and which is, from that cause, much greater in foreign countries than in his own. ... [I]t is possible that, but for Dumont, Bentham’s reputation might never have emerged from obscurity.&quot; In places, Dumont was also prepared to oversimplify Bentham&#x27;s ideas, and indeed to contradict them, for example where he considered that Bentham had been over-critical of the British constitution, or had expressed religious scepticism.

The following works of Bentham were published under Dumont&#x27;s editorship:
*&quot;Traité de legislation civile et pénale&quot; (1802)
*&quot;Théorie des peines et des recompenses&quot; (1811)
*&quot;Tactique des assemblées legislatives&quot; (1815)
*&quot;Traité des preuves judiciaires&quot; (1823)
*&quot;De l&#x27;organization judiciaire et de la codification&quot; (1828)

==French Revolution==
In the summer of 1789 Dumont went to Paris. The object of the journey was to obtain through Jacques Necker, who had just returned to office, an unrestricted restoration of Genevese liberty, by cancelling the treaty of guarantee between France and Switzerland, which prevented the republic from enacting new laws without the consent of the parties to this treaty. The proceedings and negotiations to which this mission gave rise necessarily brought Dumont into connection with most of the leading men in the Constituent Assembly, and made him an interested spectator, sometimes even a participator, indirectly, in the events of the French Revolution.

The same cause also led him to renew his acquaintance with Mirabeau, whom he found occupied with his duties as a deputy, and with the composition of his journal, the &quot;Courrier de Provence&quot;. For a time Dumont took an active and very efficient part in the conduct of this journal, supplying it with reports as well as original articles, and also furnishing Mirabeau with speeches to be delivered or rather read in the assembly, as related in his highly instructive and interesting posthumous work entitled &quot;Souvenirs sur Mirabeau&quot; (1832). In fact his friend George Wilson used to relate that one day, when they were dining together at a &quot;table d&#x27;hôte&quot; at Versailles, he saw Dumont engaged in writing the most celebrated paragraph of Mirabeau&#x27;s address to the king for the removal of the troops. He also reported such of Mirabeau&#x27;s speeches as he did not write, embellishing them from his own stores, which were inexhaustible. But this co-operation soon came to an end; for, being attacked in pamphlets as one of Mirabeau&#x27;s writers, he felt hurt at the notoriety thus given to his name in connection with a man occupying Mirabeau&#x27;s peculiar position, and returned to England in 1791. In 1791, Dumont along with the Marquis de Condorcet, Thomas Paine, and Jacques-Pierre Brissot published a brief newspaper promoting republicanism.

==Later life==
In 1801 Dumont travelled over various parts of Europe with Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, and on his return settled down to the editorship of Bentham&#x27;s works. In 1814 the restoration of Geneva to independence induced him to return there, and he soon became leader of the supreme council. He devoted particular attention to the City&#x27;s judicial and penal systems, and many improvements on both are due to him.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was an admirer of his, declaring that &quot;Dumont...is a moderate liberal, just as all rational people are and ought to be, and as I myself am.&quot;

Dumont died at Milan while on an autumn tour on 29 September 1829.
