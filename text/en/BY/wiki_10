<text>Glenn Ashby &quot;Jeep&quot; Davis (September 12, 1934 – January 28, 2009) was an American Olympic hurdler and sprinter who won a total of three gold medals in the 1956 and 1960 Olympic games.

Davis later played professional American football with the Detroit Lions and was a teacher and coach in his adopted hometown of Barberton, Ohio for 33 years.

==Childhood and early life==
Davis was born in Wellsburg, West Virginia. When both his parents died when he was 15, he moved to Barberton, Ohio with his brother. He attended Barberton High School, and Marietta High School.

Davis singlehandedly led his team to the 1954 Class A Ohio high school track and field championship, scoring all 20 of Barberton&#x27;s points. Davis won the 220-yard dash, the broad jump and the 180-yard low hurdles – setting a then-state record in that event – while also placing fourth in the 100-yard dash. His point total placed him ahead of Mansfield, which scored 14 points in the meet and took second. He was offered more than 200 athletic scholarships for college, and chose to attend Ohio State University.

==College and Olympics==
Davis won Olympic titles in the 400 meter hurdles at both the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and the Rome Olympics in 1960. In 1958, he was awarded the James E. Sullivan Award as the nation&#x27;s top amateur athlete.

Davis was either at or close to world records in many events including: 100 yards/meters (9.6/10.3), 200 meters (21.0), 400 metres (45.4), the half mile (1:52), 120 yard high hurdles (14.0), 200 meter low hurdles on curve (22.5 WR), 400 meter intermediate hurdles (49.2 WR), high jump (6–8), and long jump (24&#x27;8&quot;). He, Felix Sanchez, Angelo Taylor and Edwin Moses are the only four hurdlers to have won the Olympic 400 meter hurdles twice. However Davis is the only man to have set world records in the quarter mile with hurdles and without. His coach Larry Snyder, who also had coached Jesse Owens, said that Davis was possibly a greater talent than Jesse Owens.

Davis won a third gold medal as a member of the United States 4 x 400 meter relay team in 1960. He set world records in both flat and hurdle races. He is a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

==Later careers==
Davis was featured on the June 27, 1960 cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. After his track career, Davis played wide receiver for the Detroit Lions in 1960 and 1961. He had 10 catches for 132 yards in his two NFL seasons. He was the track coach at Cornell University from 1963 to 1967, coaching the team to the Ivy League title in his final season.

Davis was a longtime resident of Barberton, Ohio, teaching and coaching there for 33 years, and was the owner of Jeep&#x27;s Olympic Driving School. Prior to this, Davis was a popular teacher at Barberton High School and part owner of one of the students&#x27; favorite gathering spots, Jeep and Joe&#x27;s Pizza. He also loved to play the harmonica.

He was sometimes confused with Heisman Trophy-winning football player Glenn Woodward Davis (1924–2005). The two sportsmen occasionally received each other&#x27;s mail, but they never met.

<text>Friedrich St. Florian (December 21, 1932 – December 18, 2024) was an Austrian-American architect. He moved to the United States in 1961, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1973.

==Background==
St. Florian was born Friedrich St. Florian Gartler in the Austrian city of Graz, on December 21, 1932. He was quoted as having said [that] &quot;when I was 10 or 11, I was a sandcastle-builder, a dam-builder. I wanted to build for the pleasure, the delight of it really was amazing.&quot;

He studied architecture at the Graz University of Technology, where he graduated in 1960. He then won a Fulbright Fellowship which allowed him to move to the United States and study at Columbia University where he earned an additional MS in 1962, and became a citizen of the United States in 1973.

St. Florian died on December 18, 2024, at the age of 91.

==Academic career==
After teaching at Columbia University for a year, St. Florian joined the Rhode Island School of Design faculty in 1963, where he helped launch the school&#x27;s European Honors Program in Rome, which he directed from 1965 to 1967. From 1978 to 1988 he was dean of Architectural Studies and acted as Provost for Academic Affairs from 1981 to 1984.

St. Florian also taught at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, London, England; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada; the University of Texas at Austin in Austin, Texas, USA, and the University of Utah, USA.

==Professional career==
St. Florian was a practicing architect in the United States from 1974 on. His work is included in numerous private collections as well as in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, MIT, the RISD Museum, and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France. He also won the second prize for his design with Raimund Abraham and John Thornley for their entry in the competition to design the last of these.

With Abraham he also won the first prize (ex aequo) in the international architectural design competition for the &quot;Cultural Center&quot; in Leopoldville, Congo in 1959 which was not built and the third prize in the 1958 competition for the Pan Arabian University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

He served as Project Architect for Providence Place, a 450 million-dollar regional retail and entertainment center located in historic downtown Providence, Rhode Island and the largest construction project ever undertaken in Rhode Island, and the Providence Skybridge, which frames the entrance to the city.

His most prestigious completed project is probably the design of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., United States, which he won against 400 entries in 1997.

St. Florian&#x27;s office was later headquartered in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. He continued to work on international design competitions and a wide array of projects. His later built works included a modernist residence in Providence&#x27;s East Side and Urban Markers in Charlotte, North Carolina. The project named &quot;Three Pier Bridge&quot; was designed under a new firm name &quot;Studio Providence LLC&quot;, which is a collaboration between St.Florian&#x27;s firm and 3SIX0 Architecture. The &quot;Three Pier Bridge&quot; tied for first place in an international competition while also winning prizes from the BSA and AIA.

He was inspired by Louis Kahn, Mies van der Rohe, le Corbusier, and Frank Lloyd Wright. &quot;Mies van der Rohe held the Chair of the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago when I visited him. I felt like a pilgrim. His office was wide open, there were no doors. He was very curious to get news from Austria.&quot;

<doc id="694343" wikidata="Q12066084" url="?curid=694343" title="Polesworth Abbey">
<text>Polesworth Abbey was a Benedictine nunnery in Polesworth, North Warwickshire, England.

By the late 600s Edgyth (Editha), Athea and Osgyth had established hermitages at Polesworth from which the village and Benedictine Abbey developed. The detail of this early foundation was incorporated into the twelfth-century hagiographical Life of St Modwynn of Burton upon Trent. In 1066, Sir Robert Marmion expelled the nuns from Polesworth, but after seeing a vision of St. Edith, he allowed them to return; in 1242, King Henry III granted the abbey a weekly market, as well as an annual fair for St Margaret. 

==Abbey==

By 699 the Abbey had been established and accounts of Saint Edgyth (Editha) widely circulated in the local area. Polesworth Abbey is the place where the much-quoted ‘Osgyth&#x27; miracle — in which the nun, Osgyth, who had drowned in the river while delivering a Book of the Gospels to her Abbess — originates. 

Always associated with Edgytha (Saint Editha) the foundation is often confused with the later development of Tamworth Castle and the 10th century church at Tamworth, which was also dedicated to Saint Editha and where relics of the Polesworth saint were translated in the time of Ethelfleda. 

The early history also confused with that of St Modwenna of Burton whose Life was constructed in the early 12th century by Abbot Geoffrey and in which details of the foundation have been preserved. 

The site of the Abbey is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, although apart from the church and the gatehouse and the restored ruins of the cloister very little remains visible. The 12th-century Abbey church, now the parish church of St Editha, is a Grade II* listed building. The 14th-century gatehouse is both a Grade II* listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It has recently been restored and renovated to provide apartments available for rent.

==Parish church==
Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, the Abbey was granted by Henry VIII to Francis Goodere of St Albans, Hertfordshire in 1544; Goodere dismantled many of the Abbey buildings to provide stone for a new manor house (Polesworth Hall) which he built on the site. Later Sir Henry Goodere was a patron of the arts and leader of the Polesworth Group of poets, which included his protégé Michael Drayton. 

Polesworth Hall was demolished before 1868 and the Vicarage was built on the site. The abbey now functions as the Church of England parish church of Polesworth.

==Organ==
The church contains a three manual pipe organ by Taylor of Leicester. It was originally installed in 1912 in St Michael &amp; All Angels&#x27; Church, Leicester. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

<text>Thomas Conner Lynch (May 20, 1904 – May 29, 1986) was an American lawyer who served as District Attorney in San Francisco and as Attorney General of California from 1964 to 1971.

== Early life ==
Lynch was born in San Francisco in 1904 to Mary O&#x27;Conner and Patrick Lynch, an Irish immigrant from County Kerry. Lynch&#x27;s mother died in 1906, and his father was killed in 1913 attempting to rescue a fellow worker while working on a sewer excavation. Subsequently raised by extended family members, Lynch attended Catholic grammar schools in San Francisco before attending Bellarmine College Preparatory and Santa Clara University. Lynch went on to attend law school at the University of San Francisco School of Law.

Following law school, Lynch was admitted to the bar in 1930 and worked as an insurance underwriter before being appointed an Assistant U.S. Attorney in 1933. Lynch later became chief deputy to Pat Brown following Brown&#x27;s election as San Francisco District Attorney in 1943. Lifelong friends, Lynch and Brown had first met through mutual friends on trips to Yosemite.

Lynch was introduced to his future wife Virginia Summers Lynch by Pat Brown in 1928 at a dance at Camp Curry in the Yosemite Valley. The two later eloped to Lovelock, Nevada.

=== District Attorney of San Francisco ===
In 1951, Lynch was appointed District Attorney of San Francisco by Mayor Elmer Robinson following Brown&#x27;s election as Attorney General.

== Attorney General of California ==
In 1964, Lynch was appointed Attorney General by Governor Pat Brown to succeed Stanley Mosk, who Brown had appointed to the Supreme Court of California. As Attorney General, Lynch helped draft legislation relating to law enforcement, including measures to control use of narcotics, to control promotion and sales of pornographic material and to control destructive devices and dangerous weapons. He also aided to improve the quality of law enforcement.

Running for a full term in 1966, Lynch was the only Democrat to retain statewide office amid Ronald Reagan&#x27;s defeat of Pat Brown, defeating Spencer Mortimer Williams.

Notably, in 1968, Lynch released a report evaluating the actions of the city of Palm Springs in decimating the &quot;Section 14&quot; homes of approximating 200 families - almost entirely Black, Mexican-American and Native-American families leasing land from the Agua Caliente tribe, families including builders and support staff of wealthy white residents of the city – who had come home from work one day in 1965 to discover their homes bulldozed and burned down. Lynch&#x27;s report noted that those families were living in Section 14 for two key reasons: &quot;The average minority person could not afford to live in any other area of Palm Springs; and, de facto racial segregation was prevalent in Palm Springs as in other parts of California.&quot; Calling the city&#x27;s action a &quot;city-engineered holocaust&quot;, depriving Blacks and Latinos of generational wealth, the report concluded that, &quot;The city of Palm Springs not only disregarded the residents of Section 14 as property owners, taxpayers and voters; Palm Springs ignored that the residents of Section 14 were human beings.&quot; 
===1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries===
Initially tapped to lead pro-Lyndon Johnson delegation prior to Johnson&#x27;s decision not to seek reelection, Lynch ran as a favorite son candidate in the 1968 California Democratic presidential primary, placing third behind Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy.

== Later life ==
Lynch died in San Francisco on May 29, 1986, following a six year battle with cancer. At the time of his death, Lynch was an attorney with the San Francisco law firm Gerald Marcus.

<text>The Roland SH-101 is an analog synthesizer manufactured by the Roland Corporation between 1982 and 1986. Though it did not achieve significant commercial success, it later became a staple of electronic music in the 1990s, particularly house music.

==Sound and features==
The SH-101 is monophonic, meaning it can only play one note at a time. It has a single oscillator (the Curtis CEM3340) and a sub-oscillator, a low-pass filter, a mixer allowing users to blend different waveforms plus a noise generator, and an arpeggiator and sequencer. An ADSR envelope generator controls the filter and VCA, and the filter, VCA, pitch and pulse width can be controlled with an LFO. Users can attach an optional handgrip with modulation controls and shoulder strap to play the SH-101 as a keytar, and it could also be powered via battery. According to MusicRadar, the SH-101 has &quot;snappy and razor-sharp&quot; bass, &quot;squelchy and expressive&quot; leads, and a &quot;piercing yet smooth&quot; filter.

== Release ==
The SH-101 launched in the US at $495 and in UK at £249, making it much more affordable than the popular digital synthesisers of the time. Two limited edition versions were also released in both red and blue colours, in contrast to the original grey. Roland marketed the SH-101 to the emerging keytar market, with magazine slogans such as &quot;freedom for expression&quot; and “[the 101] takes you where you want to go&quot;. However, it was outsold by the digital Yamaha DX7 and was discontinued in 1986.

== Legacy ==
During the 1990s resurgence of analogue synthesisers, the 101 became a staple in dance music studios. It was used by many famous electronic musicians.

In 2014, MusicRadar wrote: &quot;Some inexpensive synths were brilliant &#x27;for the price&#x27;. The Roland SH-101 was brilliant, period. Never a rock star&#x27;s instrument like the Minimoog or Prophet-5, the 101 was a synthesiser for the rest of us, and a damned fine one, too.&quot; In 2016, &quot;Fact&quot; named the SH-101 one of the 14 most important synthesisers in history.

=== Famous users ===
Famous musicians that have used the SH-101 include:

Nitzer Ebb, Aphex Twin Vince Clarke of Erasure, Paul Frick from Tangerine Dream, Future Sound of London, Orbital, Überzone, The Prodigy, 808 State, The Grid, Eat Static, Jimmy Edgar, Apollo 440, Devo, Union Jack, Luke Vibert, Dirty Vegas, Skinny Puppy, Pig, MSTRKRFT, Josh Wink, Depeche Mode, The Crystal Method, Astral Projection, Les Rythmes Digitales, Squarepusher, KMFDM, Freddy Fresh, Lab-4, Jimmy Dickinson of Little Angels, Code 64, The Chemical Brothers, Boards of Canada, The Knife and many others.

== Hardware re-issues and recreations ==
In 2018, Roland introduced the Boutique SH-01A, a virtual analog synth, based on its Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology. It is available with or without a keyboard.

In 2019, Behringer started producing a clone of SH-101 called MS-101, since the Roland patent had expired. The layout and sound is very close to the original, with the addition of enhancements such as MIDI and USB.

In 2019, Superlative Instruments launched a Kickstarter campaign to produce the SB-1 Space Bee, very similar in layout to the SH-101 with a unique keyboard design and all keys and keyboard in dark gray.

In 2023, Roland introduced the S-1 Aira Compact, based on its Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) technology. It is a small form factor with built in keyboard.

== Software emulations ==
In June 2020, Roland released Zenology plugins for Roland synths, which includes an SH-101 emulator. Roland claims it is an ultra-detailed replica.

Other software emulators include &quot;Togu Audio Line TAL-Bassline-101&quot;, &quot;D16 Group LuSH-101&quot;, &quot;Togu Audio Line TAL-Bassline&quot; (a free limited version of the other Togu app)., and &quot;Softube Model 82&quot;.

<text>John Losch (August 13, 1934May 27, 2004) was an American athlete who was a member of the 1947 Little League World Series championship team, an All-American college football player, and member of the 1956 Green Bay Packers in the National Football League (NFL).

==Little League Baseball==
Losch was the center fielder for the Maynard Midgets of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, when they clinched the inaugural Little League World Series title against Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, on August 23, 1947.

==Football==
Losch attended the University of Miami, where he starred in football, baseball, and track. He was an All-American with the Hurricanes football team, playing three seasons (1953–1955) at halfback and defensive back. Losch was inducted to the university&#x27;s sports hall of fame in 1987. Losch still held some rushing records with Miami at the time of his death in 2004.

Losch was selected by the Green Bay Packers as the eighth overall pick in the 1956 NFL draft. He played for one season, appearing in 12 games while rushing for 43 yards (2.3 yards per carry) and making seven receptions.

==Post-playing career==
In April 1957, Losch joined the United States Air Force, where he spent three years as a jet pilot. He did not resume his NFL career, due to an injury. He worked for 37 years at General Motors Corporation, retiring in 1996 as Director of Fleet Services.

<doc id="694370" wikidata="Q3107265" url="?curid=694370" title="Border–Gavaskar Trophy">
<text>The Border–Gavaskar Trophy (colloquially known as BGT) is an International Test cricket trophy played between India and Australia. The series is named after distinguished former captains, Australia&#x27;s Allan Border and India&#x27;s Sunil Gavaskar. It is played via Test series scheduled using International Cricket Council&#x27;s Future Tours Programme. The winner of a Test series wins the trophy. If a series is drawn, the country holding the trophy retains it. Given the competitive nature of the India–Australia rivalry and the high standings of both teams, the Border–Gavaskar trophy is considered to be one of the most prestigious bilateral trophies in 5-day cricket. Throughout the history of the BGT, India have maintained competitive success against Australian teams. Out of 17 test series, India have been victorious 10 times, Australia have won 6 times, and one series was drawn. 

, Australia hold the trophy after they defeated India 3–1 in the 2024–25 series. 

In competition for the trophy since 1996, Indian Sachin Tendulkar has been the most successful batsman, scoring 3262 runs from 65 innings. Australian Nathan Lyon is the most successful bowler, taking 125 wickets in 54 innings.

==Summary of results==

==Background test series==
===Unofficial Test series===
The first ever cricket encounter between India and Australia was Australia&#x27;s 1935–36 tour of India to play a series of four unofficial Tests. It was followed by the Australian Services cricket team which toured India in 1945–46.

===Test series and one-off encounters not under the trophy===
India&#x27;s 1947–48 tour of Australia was its first after independence and included the first Test match and series between the two teams. The tours were irregularly scheduled with long gaps between them. Australia and India faced each other in the 2023 World Test Championship final, the first Test since 1991–92 between the two teams where the Border–Gavaskar Trophy was not contested.

==Border–Gavaskar Trophy series==
The table below lists the series of matches after Border–Gavaskar Trophy was instituted.

==Series summary==
The Border–Gavaskar Trophy is one of the premier bilateral trophies in Test cricket. Both teams have a reputation of being difficult to beat at home. This is borne out by India winning 8 out of 9 series held in India, and Australia winning 4 out of 7 series held in Australia, as of the conclusion of the 2022–23 series. The away wins achieved by Australia (2004–05) and India (2018–19 and 2020–2021) have earned places in cricket folklore. Both teams have achieved similar number of Test and series wins, and the trophy has changed hands frequently. The competitiveness of the series is also reflected in that in both 2000–01 and 2007–08, it was India who ended Australian streaks of 16 consecutive Test wins. The 2000–01 series was labelled as the &quot;final frontier&quot; for Australia by their captain Steve Waugh due to the difficulty of winning in India, and was closely fought on both sides.

===Series held in India===
===Series held in Australia===
===1996–97 one-off Test===
The 1996–97 one-off Test was the first to be played under the Border–Gavaskar Trophy. This was also Sachin Tendulkar&#x27;s first series as captain. The series consisted of just one match, played at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground in Delhi.

The match, played from 10 to 14 October 1996, lasted just over four days, as India defeated Australia by seven wickets. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. But the Indian spinners, led by Anil Kumble, bowled them out for 182. Michael Slater top scored with 44 runs. In reply India scored 361, riding on Nayan Mongia&#x27;s career best 152. In Australia&#x27;s second innings, Steve Waugh scored 67 to get his team to 234. This left India with 56 to get in the fourth innings, which they did for the loss of three wickets.

===1997–98 series===
The Australian cricket team headed over to India in February–March 1998 looking to get their first win in India since the 1969–70 tour. The first Test in Chennai saw Sachin Tendulkar scoring 155 from 191 balls to give India the win by 179 runs with Australia crumbling under the spin trio of Anil Kumble, Venkatapathy Raju and Rajesh Chauhan as they got out on 168. The second Test at Kolkata saw another dominating performance from one of the Indian batsman with Mohammad Azharuddin 163 runs in India&#x27;s only innings as India won the Test match by an innings and keeping the Border–Gavaskar Trophy in India.

The final Test at Bangalore saw Sachin Tendulkar get his second hundred of the series. In response, Mark Waugh got the Australians first century of the series with 153*. Australia with the help of Mark Taylor century would chase down the 194 runs that India set for them as they got the consolation win from the series to end the series at 2–1 in favour of India. At the end of the tour, Shane Warne famously said that he would be having nightmares of Tendulkar hitting him for sixes and that only Bradman was in his class.

===1999–2000 series===

Heading into the first edition of the Border–Gavaskar Trophy to be held in Australia, it was predicted to see an Australian win based on the back of the 3–0 series win at home against Pakistan. In the first Test at Adelaide, Australia got the win based from a first innings century from captain Steve Waugh while Damien Fleming&#x27;s five wicket haul in the second innings saw the collapse of India who was bowled for 110 runs to give Australia a 285 run win. Australia would take home the second Test in Melbourne by 180 runs despite Tendulkar&#x27;s century in the first innings. This Test also saw the debut of Australian bowler, Brett Lee who would go on to reach seventy two Test caps for Australia.

The final Test in Sydney saw another Australia win, this time by an innings and 141 runs. This was done with centuries from Justin Langer (223) and Ricky Ponting (141*) as Australia scored 5–552 in their only innings. Despite an effort from V. V. S. Laxman who scored 167 runs from 198 balls in the second innings, the damage was done in the first innings with India being bowled out for 150 with Glenn McGrath leading the charge as he got 10 wickets for the match.

===2000–01 series===
The 2000–01 series commenced on 27 February 2001 and concluded on 22 March 2001. The series consisted of three tests, played in Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. India won the series 2–1.

The first Test was played in Mumbai on 27 February – 1 March 2001. The game was over in only three days as Australia dominated from the beginning, putting India in to bat and then dismissing them for only 176 runs. Glenn McGrath took 3–19 and Shane Warne 4–47, Sachin Tendulkar top scoring for India with 76. Australia responded with 349 on the backs of centuries by Matthew Hayden (119) and Adam Gilchrist (122). Harbhajan Singh took 4–121. India&#x27;s second innings was barely better than their first, Tendulkar again top scoring with 65 in a total of 219. Needing only 47 runs to win, Australia&#x27;s openers knocked them off in 7 overs, taking Australia to a 10 wicket victory and a 1–0 lead in the series.

The second Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on 11 March – 15 March is regarded by many as one of the most exciting games of cricket ever played. It began with Australia electing to bat and scoring 445, captain Steve Waugh contributing 110. Harbhajan Singh took 7–123, including a hat-trick, which was the first Test hat-trick by an Indian bowler in 69 years of Indian cricketing history. India&#x27;s woes continued, being dismissed for only 171, with McGrath taking 4–18. Australia enforced the follow-on and, at the end of day 3, India were 254/4, still 20 runs behind forcing Australia to bat again. For many spectators, commentators, and even players, the match and the series were as good as lost for India.

The fourth day saw the turnaround. V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid batted the entire day, never offering a chance, and ran the Australian fielders ragged as Waugh called on nine different bowlers to try to break the partnership. Laxman and Dravid added 376 runs, taking India to 589/4 and a commanding lead in the game. In the process, Laxman set a new individual high score record for India, surpassing Sunil Gavaskar&#x27;s 236. Laxman was finally dismissed the next day on 281. Dravid made 180, and India declared on day 5 at 657/7, setting Australia an almost impossible target of 384 runs. Australia did not immediately crumble under the reversed pressure; at tea, they were 161/3 for their final innings, and a draw looked the most likely result. Then, the Australians lost 5 wickets for 8 in a span of 31 balls, with Harbhajan taking the first two wickets in the same over and Tendulkar taking the other three. Australia fell for 212 all out, with Harbhajan leading the bowling attack with 6–73. India had come back from the dead and recorded a stunning 171-run victory to level the series 1–1. They were only the third team in history to win a Test match after following on.

The Third Test began at Chennai on 18 March with high expectations of a hard-fought series decider. Australia won the toss for the third time and elected to bat. Hayden batted through the first day for an eventual total of 203, but the rest of Australia&#x27;s team contributed little to the total of 391. Again, Harbhajan Singh was the destroyer, taking 7–133. India pushed to 501 on the back of Tendulkar&#x27;s 126. Australia ended day 4 at 241/7, a precarious lead of 131 runs. Early on day 5, Harbhajan again ran through the Australian tail, taking 8–84 and his series tally to an astounding 32 wickets, leaving Australia all out for 264. India had a target of 155 to chase, and plenty of time to do it. The only question was whether Australia&#x27;s bowlers could get them out first. In 42 nail-biting overs, India steadily lost wickets, sinking to 135/7, a tantalising 20 runs short of victory, but in dire danger of losing their last batsmen before they could score them. The 8th wicket fell at 151, 4 runs short of victory, and it was left to wicket-keeper Sameer Dighe and Harbhajan Singh to see out the end. Harbhajan Singh scored the winning runs past point and sealed the game and an incredible comeback series victory for India. The series victory for India meant that Australia had still not won a series in India for over 30 years.

===2003–04 series===

The Indian cricket team toured Australia during November 2003 – February 2004. The tour included a four-Test series, which commenced on 4 December 2003 and concluded on 6 January 2004, with Test matches in Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The Test series was drawn, 1–1, and hence India retained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy.

Before this tour, India had a poor record in Test matches away from home having won just 18 out of 176 Tests. The previous tour to Australia in 1999–2000 had resulted in a 3–0 defeat and India had not won a Test match in Australia since 1981.

The first Test match was played at Brisbane from 4 to 8 December. In a rain-affected match, Australia got off to a good start with Justin Langer scoring a hundred. Scores from the remaining three batsmen out of the top four (Hayden (37), Ponting (54) and Martyn (42)) took Australia to 262 for the loss of just two wickets at the end of first day&#x27;s play. Only 18 overs were possible on the second day but the Indians picked up seven Australian wickets for the addition of only 61 runs. The third day was again affected by rain and only six overs were bowled, at the end of which, India were 11 for no loss. India started the fourth day well, but three quick wickets reduced them to 3–62. But Sourav Ganguly (144) and VVS Laxman (75) took India to 409 and a first innings lead of 86. When the last day started, only the first innings had been completed, and the match appeared to be heading for a draw. However, Australia scored quick runs as four of the top five batsmen scored fifties. Matthew Hayden scored 99 runs in 98 balls faced, as Australia declared on 284. India had scored 73 runs out of the target of 199, when play was stopped with the consent of both teams. Sourav Ganguly was Man of the Match.

The second match was played at the Adelaide Oval from 12 to 16 December. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. Ricky Ponting was the highlight as he scored 242 runs, while contributions from Simon Katich and Jason Gillespie lower down the order took Australia to a first innings score of 556. Exactly 400 of these runs were scored on the first day. India started their first innings well, but four quick wickets meant that they were in trouble at 4–85. But Dravid and Laxman, the heroes of Eden Gardens in 2001, put together a partnership which took India to 388 before Laxman was dismissed for 148. Dravid went on to string together partnerships with the tail, and was the last man dismissed as India scored 523. Rahul Dravid scored 233.

The second innings started just before lunch on the fourth day, with Australia leading by 33 first innings runs. But wickets fell all too regularly and only the lower middle order put up any resistance as Ajit Agarkar picked up six wickets. Australia were bowled out for 196. India started their second innings chasing 230 runs to win. First innings hero Rahul Dravid who was dropped by Adam Gilchrist scored an unbeaten 72 and, fittingly, hit the winning runs as India won by four wickets. This was the first win for India in Australia since February 1981. Rahul Dravid was Man of the Match. India led the series 1–0

The third Test match was the traditional Boxing Day Test played at Melbourne. India got off to a good start, with Virender Sehwag scoring 195, and ended the first day at 4–329. But in the first session on the second day, wickets fell quickly and India were bowled out for 366. Australia, in their first innings, put up 558 runs, with centuries from Hayden (136) and Ponting (257). This was Ponting&#x27;s second double hundred in as many matches. Anil Kumble picked up six wickets.

India started the second innings 192 runs behind. Dravid (92) and Sourav Ganguly (73) were the only players to cross fifty, and India were bowled out for 286. This gave Australia a target of only 95, which they achieved for the loss of one wicket, levelling the series at 1–1. Ricky Ponting was Man of the Match for his 257.

The fourth and final Test was the New Year&#x27;s Test at Sydney, notable also for being Steve Waugh&#x27;s last Test match.

India won the toss and elected to bat first. The opening stand between Sehwag (72) and Chopra (45) was worth 123 runs. The spotlight, though, was on Sachin Tendulkar, who had not had success with the bat on the tour. He responded by scoring 241 unbeaten runs and put up 353 runs for the fourth wicket with Laxman (178). This particular innings came across as masterclass in disciplined batting as Sachin shelved one of his favourite shorts – the &quot;cover drive&quot; in entirety. A cameo from &#x27;keeper Parthiv Patel took India to 705–7 declared, India&#x27;s highest-ever Test score. Australia started well, with Hayden and Langer putting up a 147-run opening stand. But they were in trouble at 7–350 before Katich and Gillespie put on 117 runs for the eighth wicket to take Australia to 474, Anil Kumble taking 8–141.

India started the second innings 231 runs ahead and requiring quick runs to force a result. Sehwag (47), Dravid (91*) and Tendulkar (60*) all contributed, as India raced to 211 in 43 overs to set Australia 443 to win. Four overs at the end of the fourth day produced no wickets and Australia had to play out the last day to save the Test, while India needed 10 wickets to win. The Australian batting responded well under pressure, with Langer, Ponting and Martyn scoring forties. But at 4–196, with more than one session to go, the match could have gone either way. However Steve Waugh, playing his last Test, and Simon Katich put the match out of India&#x27;s reach. Waugh scored 80 and Katich was unbeaten on 77 as the match was drawn despite 4 more wickets for Kumble which gave him 12 wickets for the match itself. Despite Kumble&#x27;s efforts on a flat wicket, Sachin Tendulkar was Man of the Match for his unbeaten scores of 241 and 60 in the match. The series score was maintained at 1–1.

Rahul Dravid was Man of the Series for 619 runs in four matches. The series was hailed as one of the best that had been played in Australia. 

===2004–05 series===
The Australian cricket team toured India from 6 October 2004 to 5 November 2004 for a four-Test series. The series featured matches played at Bangalore, Chennai, Nagpur and Mumbai. Australia won the series 2–1.

This was Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath&#x27;s last tour of India. They came with the desire to end Australia&#x27;s 35-year drought of winning a Test match series in India. Before this series India had performed poorly in tours of Sri Lanka and the Netherlands, and in the ICC Champions Trophy.

Australia won the first Test played at Bangalore comprehensively. The Indian batting order collapsed twice and they didn&#x27;t look at any point that they could have made a match out of it. Michael Clarke, playing his first ever Test match, scored 151 runs to take Australia to a commanding position. Harbhajan Singh took another 10-wicket haul (5–146 and 6–78) in the match. Anil Kumble took his 400th wicket. Clarke was awarded Man of the Match.

Being 1–0 down in the series, India started the second Test match played between 14 and 18 October 2004 at Chennai on a positive note. They got rid of Australia in the first innings for a mere 235 runs. Earlier, Justin Langer (71) and Matthew Hayden (58) started the Australian innings with a bang. They contributed 136 runs for the opening wicket. When it looked as if Australia would dominate this Test as well, Anil Kumble struck consistently and produced a beautiful bowling spell in which he took 7 wickets for just 48 runs from his 17.3 overs. Australia&#x27;s innings collapsed from 189–3 to 235 all out. In reply India scored 376 runs and took a commanding lead of 141 runs. Virender Sehwag scored a magnificent 155 runs, Mohammed Kaif on his comeback match scored 64 and was well supported by young Parthiv Patel (54). Shane Warne took 6 wickets for 125 runs, overtaking Muttiah Muralitharan as the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket with 537 wickets (though Muralitharan would overtake Warne in December 2007, almost a year after Warne&#x27;s retirement in January of the same year). The top order of Australian innings collapsed again in the 2nd innings, but then Damien Martyn notched up a century (104) at the crucial time with the result being that the Australians had scored 369 runs in their second innings, setting a victory target of 229 runs for India to win. India had a good chance of winning the game, but rain on the final day prevented any chance of play, therefore, the match ended in a draw. Anil Kumble took 6 wickets for 133 runs and was awarded Man of the Match.

The third Test of the series was played between 26 and 30 October at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground at Nagpur. Australia won the match and series in four days. Australia posted 398 in their first innings, with Damien Martyn posting 114 runs with Michael Clarke making 91. In contrast, India played poorly in their first innings and none of their top order batsmen got going. The only batsman to make above 50 was Mohammed Kaif (55). Sachin Tendulkar, who returned from injury, made just 8 runs. India made 185 runs, 14 runs short of the follow-on. Australia rejected the follow-on and began their second innings, setting a target in excess of 500. But once again the Indians were bundled out for 200. None of the frontline batsman made a big score. Sehwag and Patel provided some hope but fell to the Australia&#x27;s metronomic bowling. Australia won the third Test by 342 runs. Martyn was awarded Man of the Match. With this win, Australia won this Test series after 35 years of trying for success in India, a feat which has been termed the final frontier by Steve Waugh.

The fourth and final Test match was played between 3–7 November 2004 at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Having already lost the series, India made changes in the team. Patel, Akash Chopra, Ajit Agarkar and Yuvraj Singh were all dropped from the lineup. The first day of play was almost completely washed out by rain, with only 11 overs being bowled. India won the toss and elected to bat. The innings started on a bad note, losing 2 wickets on the first day itself. On the second day India was bowled out for their second-lowest score ever of 104 runs, with Rahul Dravid scoring the highest score in the innings of 31 runs. Jason Gillespie (4–29) was the main wicket taker for Australia. Australia&#x27;s first innings also didn&#x27;t last long, as they were bowled out on the same day for a score of 203 runs, with Martyn (55) top scoring. Murali Kartik (4–44) and Kumble (5–90) were the main wicket takers. 18 wickets fell in all on the second day of play. India made 205 runs in their second innings, with significant scores from V.V.S. Laxman (69) and Tendulkar (55). Michael Clarke (6–9) removed the tail order within 23 runs. Chasing 107 runs for victory, Australia lost wickets consistently throughout their second innings and were bowled out for 93 runs, giving India a victory by 13 runs. Harbhajan Singh (5–29) and Murali Kartik (3–32) took most of the wickets. Murali Kartik was named Man of the Match. This Test is one of the shortest Test matches ever played, lasting for only 2 complete days. The pitch prepared for the match had later come in for a lot of criticism by Ricky Ponting.

Damien Martyn was named Man of the Series.

===2007–08 series===
The Indian cricket team toured Australia during December 2007 to March 2008. This was the last visit of former India Captain Sourav Ganguly to Australia before his retirement. The tour included a four-Test series, which commenced on 26 December 2007 and concluded 28 January 2008, with Test matches in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide. Australia won the series 2–1

Australia won the first Test in Melbourne by 337 runs within four days. Australia scored 343 runs in the first innings riding on Matthew Hayden&#x27;s 124. In reply, India folded for 196 with Clark and Lee taking 4 wickets each. India was set a target of 499 runs which they never challenged.

Australia won the second Test by 122 runs in Sydney on the 5th day. With only nine minutes to spare – Michael Clarke took 3 wickets in what would probably have been the second last over.

India fought back with a win in the third Test in Perth by 72 runs. Two changes were made to the Indian team for this game, dropping the out of form Yuvraj Singh, and Harbhajan Singh, and recalling Virender Sehwag and Irfan Pathan. Australia had also made two changes to their team. Chris Rogers was brought in to replace the injured Matthew Hayden to become the 399th Test player for Australia. Shaun Tait was brought in for tactical reasons to replace Brad Hogg as Australia went with a four-pronged pace attack.

India won the toss and elected to bat and the changes were to have an immediate impact. Jaffer and Sehwag contributed for the first opening partnership above fifty of the tour. Dravid, now relieved of his opening duties, found some semblance of form and was dismissed just short of a century on 93 as the highest scorer of the innings as India reached 330.

Pathan&#x27;s recall to the team was immediately successful, dismissing both Australian openers. Australia&#x27;s top order collapsed, leaving them at 5–63, as they struggled with the swing bowling of the Indian pace attack. A century partnership between Symonds and Gilchrist helped Australia recover to 212, which gave India a lead of 118.

In India&#x27;s second innings, Sehwag again proved his worth as he scored 43 in 61 balls to give momentum at the top of the order. At the dismissal of Jaffer, Pathan came in as night-watchman and scored 46, the second highest score of the innings behind Laxman&#x27;s 79. India were eventually dismissed for 294, leaving Australia the imposing target of 413 to win.

Australia were bowled out for 340, 73 runs short of their target, and India once again put a stop to an Australian 16 Test winning streak. Pathan again dismissed the two Australian openers, while Sehwag proved a useful contributor by dismissing Gilchrist and Lee. Australia&#x27;s team changes proved unsuccessful, with Rogers having scores of 4 and 15, and Tait, wicketless in the match and bowled sparingly. Ponting, in a post match interview with Channel 9, laid the blame for the defeat on a poor first innings batting performance, while Kumble praised the contributions of his team and his young pace attack.

Normally, in Australia, during their era of dominance, the final matches of a series was usually a dead rubber. Thanks to India&#x27;s emphatic performance in Perth, which could have provided for a good final match at Adelaide for people to watch. India once again won the toss and elected to bat first. India made one change, bringing back Harbhajan Singh in place of Wasim Jaffer. Australia made two changes, Hayden comes back after recovered from injury in place of Chris Rogers, erratic Tait gives a way to Brad Hogg. This Test was the last Test for wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist.

Opening the innings with Pathan back-fired for India, as he got out early. On a balancing first day, India made total of 309–5, thanks to major contribution from Sachin Tendulkar&#x27;s 39th ton. Tendulkar went unbeaten on 124 on the first day. On the second day, Sachin and Dhoni got out early, but a stubborn innings from Kumble and an attacking innings from Harbhajan took India past 500. Kumble was unlucky to miss a century and he was the last man to get out. Australia played with caution and they did not lose any wicket on the second day. Australia were at 62–0 at stumps.

Australia&#x27;s openers went on to dominate and made a 159 for the opening wicket. At one stage Australia were 241–3. Australia were finally bowled out for 563. India&#x27;s efforts went in to saving the Test match, but India once again lost Pathan early in the innings. India finished 4th day at 45–1.

Sehwag went on to score 151. Even though other batsmen fell cheaply, his innings made sure that India would not lose the Test match. Kumble declared the India innings at 269/7 and the match finished early as a draw. Tendulkar was awarded Man of the Match.

===2008–09 series===

The first Test of the 2008–09 season was played at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. This match ended in a draw.

The second Test match was played at the PCA Stadium in Mohali, Punjab. The Indians dished out a clinical all-round performance to outclass Australia by a record 320 runs on Day 5 to lead the 4-Test series 1–0. This was the biggest win for India in Test match cricket excluding an innings victory. It was a historical match for India with Sachin Tendulkar who became the highest run scorer in Test match history surpassing record of 11,957 runs marks and on the way becoming the first man to score 12000 runs in Test cricket history. It was a historic outing for Sourav Ganguly too, as he passed 7000 runs in Test cricket and scored a century in the process.

The Third Test match was played at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi. Anil Kumble declared his retirement from Test matches after suffering from torn fingers. He was the captain of the Indian side in this game. The match ended in a draw and VVS Laxman was declared the Man of the Match. Gautam Gambhir and Laxman scored double hundreds in India&#x27;s First Innings.

The Fourth Test was played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Nagpur. India won by 172 runs to regain the coveted Border–Gavaskar trophy after a gap of four years.

After setting the visitors a daunting target of 382 for victory in a turning fifth day track, India went on to dismiss the Aussies for 209 at just before the tea to wrap up the four-match series with a 2–0 margin. It turned out to be a perfect gift for Sourav Ganguly by his teammates in his farewell Test as they bowled out the Aussies in just about two sessions of play on the last day.

Indian fast bowler Ishant Sharma was declared the man of the series.

===2010–11 series===
India won the 2-Test series 2–0. Sachin Tendulkar was declared the man of the series.

* The first Test was played at PCA Stadium in Mohali, Punjab 1–5 October 2010. India won by one wicket. Zaheer Khan was named as the Man of the Match.

The first Test was an instant classic. Australia made 428 in its first innings. Opening batsman Shane Watson scored a century and Wicket keeper Tim Paine made a 92 to lead the charge. In reply India&#x27;s top order almost contributed equally with Sachin Tendulkar scoring 98 and Suresh Raina scoring 86. India made 405 in their first innings. Indian bowlers led a surge in the second Innings to rout Australia to 192. India were set a target of 216. Wickets started to fall in the evening of 4th day with Ben Hilfenhaus taking the key wickets of Gambhir, Sehwag and Raina. The score stood at 55/4 at the end of 4th day&#x27;s Play with Tendulkar playing with night watchman Zaheer Khan. Australia started the 5th day well to remove Zaheer Khan first. VVS Laxman who played late down the order because of his back injury joined Tendulkar for the 6th wicket. They improved the scoring rate considerably. However Tendulkar was out for 38 trying to play an upper late cut off Bollinger. MS Dhoni then followed Tendulkar as he was run out following a confusion with Raina who was a by runner for VVS Laxman. The score stood at 122/7. Harbhajan too was out pretty quickly facing just two deliveries. It looked all but over for India. India were 124/8 with an injury-ridden VVS Laxman and Ishant sharma at the crease and only Pragyan Ojha to follow. India still needed 92 runs to win with just two wickets remaining at lunch. It looked like a lost cause to India.

The post lunch session was one of the most dramatic sessions in Test history. VVS Laxman played one of his best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, but surely inching towards their target. In what seemed like forever, India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson&#x27;s over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.

At this point of time, three results were possible (India win, Australia win and a Tie). Mitchell Johnson then strayed a delivery on to the leg side and Ojha did well to just push it past the wicket keeper. The Indian batsmen ran a couple and had won the match. VVS Laxman top scored in the second innings with an unbeaten 73 and once again proved himself a nemesis to Australia turning certain defeat into glorious victory similar to Kolkata 2001, Adelaide 2003.

With this win, it meant that India can hold onto the trophy even if it lost the next Test match as India won the 2008/09 series 2–0.

* The second Test was played at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, 9–13 October. India won by 7 wickets. Sachin Tendulkar was named as the Man of the Match.

Sachin Tendulkar was the most successful batsmen, scoring 403 runs in four innings at an average of 134.33. Zaheer Khan was the leading wicket-taker with 12 wickets in two Tests.

===2011–12 series===
Australia won the first Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by 122 runs within 4 days. Australia scored 333 in their first innings with debutant Ed Cowan top scoring on 68. In reply India collapsed from 3/214 to 282 all out with Ben Hilfenhaus taking 5 wickets on his return to Test Cricket from injury. Australia then recovered from their own collapse to 4/27 with Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey building a partnership of 115 in Australia&#x27;s 2nd innings total of 240. India was set a target of 292, but regular wickets to the Australian pacemen saw them all out for 169. Man of the Match was awarded to James Pattinson with figures of 18*, 2/55, and 4/53. He also made 37*.

The second Test started with India collapsing for 191 after winning the toss on day one at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australia in reply scored 659/4 with Michael Clarke scoring a triple century (329 not out), Michael Hussey scoring 150 not out and Ricky Ponting scoring 134. In reply, India folded up when trailing by 68 runs. Sachin Tendulkar scored 80 as Australia won the Test.

The third Test started with India batting first, but only managed 161 runs in the first innings. The Australians replied with 369, including a century from 69 deliveries from David Warner, the fastest century by an opener. In the second innings, the Indians were bowled out for 171, and Australia won the match by an innings and 37 runs. Australia leads the series 3–0, and have regained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy.

The fourth Test started with Australia batting first, and notching up 7/604 declared with Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting both scoring double centuries. India managed 272 runs in the first innings, with Virat Kohli scoring his maiden Test century. Australia did not enforce the follow-on, batting 5/167 declared to set India a target of 500 runs. India was bowled out for 201, 298 runs short. The player of the match was Peter Siddle, and the player of the series was Michael Clarke.

===2012–13 series===

In the first match of the series, Australia won the toss and batted first and scored 380 in the first innings. They started really well in the innings but Ravichandran Ashwin ripped through the middle order to restrict them. The Indian team started their first innings in a shaky manner by losing two early wickets. However, Sachin and Cheteshwar Pujara took the score over 100. After losing Pujara, India was again in a bad condition but Kohli scored a hundred and was not out on day 2. MS Dhoni scored a fantastic 224 to give India a strong lead. In their second innings, the Australians quickly lost their wickets to the Indian spinners. At one time, they were 180/9, however, Moises Henriques&#x27; 81* took the total score to 241. India chased down the target of 50 with the loss of two wickets and won the match. M. S. Dhoni was judged Man of the Match for his 224 in the first innings.

In the second Test, the Australian batting order collapsed and captain, Michael Clarke, took a surprising decision to declare their innings at 237/9 in the hope to let India play the remaining three overs of the day. But India were 5–0 at the end of three overs. India lost Virender Sehwag early next day but a fantastic partnership between Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara saw India surpass a total of 500. Pujara scored 204 runs while Vijay scored 167. In their second innings, the Australian batting order collapsed for a mere 131 and India won the match by an innings and 135 runs, thus, gaining a lead of 2–0 in the series. Cheteshwar Pujara was judged Man of the Match for his 204.

The first day of the third Test at Chandigarh was washed away by rain. This time Australia did well to score above 400 with half centuries by Ed Cowan and David Warner while Steven Smith and Mitchell Starc missing out on centuries. Starc missed it for 99 and out while Smith was out on 92. But debutant Shikhar Dhawan who had come in for Sehwag made a record 187 runs on debut and became the highest run scorer for India while playing on debut. Vijay also hit consecutive centuries and took the total to 499. The Australian team were dismissed for 223 after the good work by the bowlers and India got a target of 133 on the last day. With wickets falling at regular intervals and shortage of time, the match had become thrilling whether India would win or the match be drawn. But Jadeja and Dhoni ensured the 3–0 series win. Debutant Shikhar Dhawan was judged Man of the Match.

The fourth Test saw a fighting spirit by the Aussies when they scored 262 but dismissed India for 272 and not letting them take a lead bigger than 10 runs. The first two days were filled with sledging by the Aussies. On day two, it was being said that the match was evenly poised but continuous collapse of Australia on day three did not enable them to set a good target despite fifties by Peter Siddle in both innings—a record for half-centuries in both innings of a Test match by a number 9 batsman. India&#x27;s target of 155 was easily achieved on the same day with contribution from Kohli&#x27;s 41, Dhoni&#x27;s 12 not out and Pujara not out on 82. Dhoni hit the winning runs and India created history by winning four Test matches in a series for the first time. Ravindra Jadeja was awarded the Man of the Match award for his career-best 5–58 and Ravichandran Ashwin was named the Man of the Series for his 29 wickets in four matches.

===2014–15 series===

In the first match of the series, Australia won the toss and batted first, scoring 517/7d in the first innings. This was the Test captaincy debut series for Virat Kohli. The Australian batting started the innings with fireworks, with David Warner&#x27;s 145 run knock in just 163 balls. Steve Smith played an unbeaten innings of 162. Day 2 was wasted due to rain. During the third day the Indian batting order managed to score 444, conceding a lead of 73 runs to Australia, with Virat Kohli scoring 115 runs. Australia then scored 290/5d in their second innings, with David Warner again scoring a ton. In the fourth innings, India were bowled out for 315, despite another Kohli ton, handing a 48 run win to Australia. Nathan Lyon was declared the Man of the Match for his 12-wicket haul.

The second match was again won by Australia, giving them a 2–0 lead in the series. The final two Tests were drawn, meaning that Australia won the series 2–0, and regained the Border–Gavaskar trophy.

The first Test was considered as a tribute to Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes. The tribute was given by wearing a black band which had 408 written on it, which was the cap number of Hughes. The batsmen gave him tribute on scoring landmarks and scoring 63 runs. Hughes died after being struck by a bouncer while playing for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game, while he was being widely considered as a long-term Australian Test representative.

===2016–17 series===

In the first match of the series, Australia won the toss and batted first. DRS was used for the first time in the Border–Gavaskar Trophy in this series, although HotSpot was not used. Australia played the first Test match in Pune. Australia won by 333 runs courtesy of 12 wickets of Steve O&#x27;Keefe.

In the second Test match that took place in Bangalore, Nathan Lyon took 8 for 50 in India&#x27;s first innings, as Australia dominated day one. But with the two fifties of opener KL Rahul, 92 runs by Cheteshwar Pujara and six wicket haul by Ravichandran Ashwin sealed the second match for India to win by 75 runs and level the series 1–1.

The third Test was drawn and the fourth was won by India who thus achieved a 2–1 series victory—their seventh Border–Gavaskar trophy.

=== 2018–19 series ===

Heading into the 2018–19 series, Australia was without its top-order batsman David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft due to the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town against South Africa. Ishant Sharma prior to the start of the series, stated &quot;That&#x27;s the biggest opportunity for us right now&quot;. This was proven with Australian media stating that it was the best opportunity for India to win the trophy and the series in Australia.
The first Test in Adelaide saw Cheteshwar Pujara score 123 and 71 in forging a considerable last-innings target of 322 for Australia. Despite a worthy 5th-day battle by Australia&#x27;s tail-enders, India won by 31 runs —their first win in Australia since 2008.

The second Test was held at Perth Stadium and saw Australia levelling the series at 1–1 with a 146 run win. This was done by Nathan Lyon eight wickets in the two innings as he received the Man of the Match. During that match, Virat Kohli scored his 25th century as he scored 123 in the first innings as India tail-enders collapsed in the second innings with Lyon and Starc doing the damage as India collapsed for only 140.

The third Test in Melbourne saw Pujara scoring his second century of the Test series—106—before India declared its first innings closed at 443/7. Australia (151 and 261) were finally crushed by 137 runs. Jasprit Bumrah took 6–33 in the first innings and another three in the second innings, to be awarded as Man of the Match. This win meant India retained the Border–Gavaskar Trophy and could create history as the first Indian team to win a series in Australia.

The fourth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground ended in a draw but not before Pujara top-scored for India in their only innings with 193, with help from Rishabh Pant who scored 159. India bowled Australia out for 300 which forced a follow-on for the first time since 1988 before the match was rained out. Pujara was the player of the series after scoring 521 runs over the whole series.

=== 2020–21 series ===

Entering the series, India held the Border–Gavaskar Trophy after winning in Australia, 2–1 in 2018–19 and at home, 2–1 in 2017. The last time Australia had won a series was at home, 2–0 in 2014–15.

The first Test in Adelaide was a day-night Test in which India won the toss and elected to bat first. India scored 244 in their first innings, led by captain Virat Kohli who scored 74 before being run out. In reply, Australia were bowled out for 191, giving India a lead of 53. Australian captain Tim Paine was the top-scorer in the innings; he finished on 73* off 99 balls. The second innings saw India register their lowest total in Test cricket, just 36. It was also the lowest Test total in the 21st century. No batsman reached double figures, only the second time ever in Test cricket. India, in the due course of this innings, lost another seamer in Mohammed Shami to a forearm fracture, courtesy a blow by a Pat Cummins&#x27; short ball. Josh Hazlewood recorded figures of 5/8 from 5 overs, the most economical five-wicket haul by an Australian bowler in Tests since 1947. Australia successfully chased the target of 90 runs inside 21 overs. They finished at 2/93, winning by 8 wickets. Tim Paine was named the player of the match for his batting and keeping.

The second Test, the Boxing Day Test, took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne. In that test and the two tests following it, India&#x27;s regular captain Virat Kohli was taking paternity leave. Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane would be leading India in Kohli&#x27;s absence. Australian captain Tim Paine won the toss and elected to bat first. Australia were bowled out for 195 in the first innings. In reply, Rahane&#x27;s century led India to 326, giving them a lead of 131 runs. In the second innings, Australia were bowled out for 200 giving India a target of 70 runs to win. They accomplished this task for the loss of two wickets. Ajinkya Rahane was named the player of the match for his century in the first innings, also winning the first ever Mullagh Medal.

The third Test was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney, starting on 7 January 2021. Australian captain Tim Paine won the toss and elected to bat first. Australia posted a first-innings total of 338, including a Steve Smith century and fifties from Marnus Labuschagne and debutant Will Pucovski. Despite stubborn fifties from Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara, India in reply were bowled out for 244, giving Australia a lead of 94 runs. In the second innings, Cameron Green top-scored for Australia as they declared on 6/312 after 87 overs, giving India a target of 407 runs to win. Victory seemed very unlikely, with only Rishabh Pant top-scoring at 97 runs followed by Cheteshwar Pujara with 77 runs. The match was eventually drawn after India ended their innings at 5/334 with the heroics of Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari who both batted for 289 balls. Steve Smith was named the Man of the Match.

The deciding fourth Test was played at The Gabba, Brisbane. Touted as &quot;&#x27;Gabbatoir&#x27; or &#x27;Fortress Gabba&quot;&#x27; in the cricketing circuit due to Australia&#x27;s impeccable unbeaten Test record at this ground in over 31 matches played over the last 32 years, India was further pushed against the wall with even more player injuries; so many so that Indian team was able to retain only two of the eleven players who had contested the first Test in Adelaide. India was obliged to field a bowling line-up that had a combined experience of four tests and only 13 wickets (including two by part timer Rohit Sharma) before this match. This Test was the 100th for Australia&#x27;s Nathan Lyon, the 13th Australian player to achieve that milestone. Australia won the toss and elected to bat first, compiling 369 in their first innings with a century by Marnus Labuschagne. India was dismissed for 336 in its first innings, giving Australia a lead of 33 runs. Australia were bowled out for 294 in their second innings, which gave India a target of 328 runs. Despite being pushed against the wall, India successfully chased the target with three overs to spare on the final day. They finished at 7/329, winning by three wickets and winning the series 2–1. This was the first time Australia lost a Test match at The Gabba since 1988, while the last drawn match was in 2012. Pat Cummins was named the Man of the Series and Rishabh Pant was named the Man of the Match for his match winning knock of 89*. The ICC, according to its global polling results, regards this series as the Ultimate Test match series of all time.

<doc id="694379" wikidata="Q990738" url="?curid=694379" title="Manta, Ecuador">
<text>Manta, also known as San Pablo de Manta, is a city in Ecuador, cantonal head of the Manta Canton, as well as the largest and most populated city in the Manabí Province. It is the seventh most populous in the country. Manta has existed since Pre-Columbian times. It was a trading post for the Manta, also known as Manteños.

According to the 2022 census, the city had a population of 258,697. In the 21st century, its main economic activity is tuna fishing. Other economic activities include tourism and a chemical industry, with products ranging from cleaning supplies to oils and margarine.

Located on the Pacific coast, Manta has the largest seaport in Ecuador. The port was used by Charles Marie de La Condamine upon his arrival in Ecuador in 1735 when leading the French mission to measure the location of the equator. From Manta, Condamine started his trip inland towards Quito.

Manta has an international airport, Eloy Alfaro International Airport, with passenger airline service, and an important military base (known as Manta Air Base or Eloy Alfaro Air Base). Between 1999-2009 Manta Air Base was used by U.S. air forces to support anti-narcotics military operations and surveillance flights against Colombian drug trafficking cartels. The lease was not renewed by the Ecuadorian government.

Manta is recognized for its international film festival, featuring groups from different places in the world. The Ecuadorian actor Carlos Valencia was invited to Cannes Film Festival for his performance in &quot;Ratas Ratones y Rateros&quot; (1999), directed by Sebastián Cordero. The latter was born in the capital city of Quito.

==Sport==

Sporting events take place in November, and from January through April. Football is the main sport of the city, as it is in the nation. The city has two professional teams: Delfín S.C. and Manta F.C. Other teams have included Green Cross F.C., America, Juventud Italiana, and River Plate.

Other sports in Manta include surfing (Manta was the host for the 2004 Bodyboarding World Cup), scuba diving, water skiing, and kitesurfing. Nearby Salinas was the site of the ISA World Junior Surfing Games Ecuador in 2009. Manta hosted the sixth South American Windsurfing Championship.

Manta has underwater diving and sport fishing.

Tennis is also played in Manta. A number of ATP Challenger Series have been played in the city.

==Entertainment and culture==

Manta hosts an International Theater Festival in September. A MAAC cine, one of four in Ecuador, shows independent and non-Hollywood productions.

The Central Bank Museum includes an important collection of Pre-Columbian craft.

==Economy==

Manta has one of the larger economies in Ecuador. The main industries are fishing and tuna canning and processing. Processed tuna is exported to Europe and the U.S. International tuna corporations including Bumble Bee, Van Camps, British Columbia Packers, and Conservas Isabel, as well as leading national tuna processor Marbelize, have sizable factories in Manta.

Other important products include vegetable oil. Large Ecuadorian corporations, including La Fabril and Ales, have their main factories in Manta.

According to a recent survey by &quot;Vistazo&quot; magazine, many of the largest companies by revenue in Ecuador are located in the Manta metropolitan area. It is third after Quito and Guayaquil, which both are home to larger companies.

Tourism is increasingly important for Manta&#x27;s economy. Various cruise ships have made Manta a port of call while traveling the southern Pacific Ocean. In addition, the original and official &quot;Panama&quot; hats are produced in Manabí. Internationally known, they are made in the nearby town of Montecristi. Montecristi hats are popular souvenirs for many visitors to Manta.

==Tourism==

Manta receives numerous visits from foreign as well as local tourists. The most visited beaches include &quot;El Murciélago&quot;, &quot;Santa Marianita&quot;, &quot;San Lorenzo&quot; and &quot;Barbasquillo&quot;. Surfers often travel to San Lorenzo to find powerful waves, which are regularly head high.

Kitesurfing has recently become very popular in Santa Marianita (Playa Bonita) because of the excellent wind conditions and long beach.

Nearby is the small town of Montecristi, founded in the early 17th century. It has colonial architecture but is best known for its wickerwork weaving. It is also the original birthplace of Panama hats; despite their name, they were historically produced in Ecuador.

==Gallery==
==Education==

Manta possesses a number of universities and high schools. The largest and most traditional university is Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro; others include Universidad del Pacifico (Pacific University) and Manta Institute of Technology. The most traditional high schools include Colegio San Jose, Colegio Senoritas Manta, and Colegio Stella Maris.

Foreign-oriented upper class high schools include Jefferson High School (American), Julio Pierregrosse High School (Spanish), and Leonardo da Vinci High School (Italian). These are the most prestigious high schools in the city, keeping international academic standards. The Spanish language school, Academia Surpacifico, has more than 14 years of experience teaching Spanish to foreigners.

==Climate==
Despite the city&#x27;s location on the equator, the Humboldt Current gives Manta an arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;). The city is cloudy and hot most of the year, and rainfall is erratic and largely confined to the months between January and April. At these times, it occurs mainly during El Niño events, when the Humboldt Current weakens.

==Sister cities==
Manta has one sister city, as designated by Sister Cities International:

* Vladivostok, Russia

<doc id="694383" wikidata="Q540864" url="?curid=694383" title="Becker (TV series)">
<text>Becker is an American sitcom television series created by Dave Hackel that aired on CBS for six seasons from November 2, 1998, to January 28, 2004, with a total of 129 episodes. Produced by Dave Hackel Productions and Industry Entertainment in association with Paramount Television, the show is set in the New York City borough of the Bronx, and starred Ted Danson as the title character, John Becker, a misanthropic doctor who operates a small practice and is constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, and friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. Despite everything, his patients and friends are loyal because Becker genuinely cares about them.

==Premise==
The show revolved around Becker and the things that annoyed him, although the members of the supporting cast also had their moments. The relationships between Becker and Reggie, and, later, Becker and Chris formed the key plots of many episodes. The show tackled more serious issues as well, such as race, homosexuality, transgender identities, addiction, nymphomania, schizophrenia, cerebral AVM, and political correctness.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==
* Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker
* Hattie Winston as Margaret Wyborn
* Shawnee Smith as Linda
* Alex Désert as Jake Malinak
* Terry Farrell as Regina &#x27;Reggie&#x27; Kostas (seasons 1–4)
* Saverio Guerra as Bob (recurring, seasons 1–2; main, seasons 3–5)
* Nancy Travis as Christine &quot;Chris&quot; Connor (guest, season 4; main, seasons 5–6)
* Jorge Garcia as Hector Lopez (season 6)

===Terry Farrell&#x27;s departure===
Terry Farrell was written out of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (where she played Jadzia Dax) after her contract expired without renegotiation. Soon after, Farrell got the role of Reggie. According to Farrell, the original plan was for Reggie and Becker to have a relationship with romantic tension over the course of the show; the show&#x27;s ending would be them going on their first date. However, the producers became worried that this would be compared to Sam and Diane&#x27;s relationship on &quot;Cheers&quot;, so they backed away from it.

At the end of season four, Nancy Travis was introduced for a short arc playing Chris, Becker&#x27;s new neighbor. Chris was a cheerful and optimistic character, the opposite of Becker, and would serve as a rival for Reggie. The season ended with a cliffhanger as Reggie kissed Becker and then left. However, Farrell was dropped at the end of season four, which came as a shock to her. Creator and executive producer David Hackel and Farrell have both stated that it had nothing to do with Farrell supporting the cast in a lawsuit and walkout for a promised pay raise after season three. Hackel said that Chris and Becker&#x27;s relationship would &quot;shake things up a bit,&quot; which the network wanted, and that, instead of having Reggie do the usual thing and return to patch things up, she would just decide to leave.

==Syndication==
The show was offered in syndication between 2003 and 2004 after its network run on CBS ended. In the United States, the show aired on WGN America until 2010. ReelzChannel added the show in fall 2010. As of 2023, &quot;Becker&quot; aired on Antenna TV, Pluto TV, and Rewind TV.

In Australia, &quot;Becker&quot; was originally broadcast on Network Ten. Reruns of the series have been aired weekdays on Foxtel&#x27;s pay TV network 111 funny and Network Ten&#x27;s digital channel 10 Peach.

==Home media==
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released all six seasons of &quot;Becker&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Seasons 4-6 are Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases, available exclusively via Amazon.com&#x27;s CreateSpace program.

On June 6, 2017, CBS DVD released &quot;Becker: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In Region 2, Paramount Home Entertainment released the first season on DVD on April 28, 2008. There were issues with the discs that meant audio and video were out of sync.

In Region 4, Paramount Home Entertainment released the first three seasons on DVD in 2008/2009. In 2013, Umbrella Entertainment acquired the rights to the series and subsequently re-released the first three seasons. Season 4 was released on February 5, 2014. Season 5 and 6 were released in August 2016.

==Reception==
&quot;Becker&quot; debuted as part of CBS&#x27; highly rated Monday night lineup as a midseason replacement for the canceled sitcom &quot;The Brian Benben Show&quot;, taking over the timeslot at 9:30 PM Eastern time. The show performed well for its first four seasons, piggybacking off the ratings of its lead-in, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;; in its first four seasons, &quot;Becker&quot; ranked in the top 20 and peaked at #13 in its four seasons.

Despite the ratings wins they were getting with the series, CBS decided to try to find a new home for &quot;Becker&quot; and relocated the sitcom to lead off its Sunday night lineup. The ratings unexpectedly fell as &quot;Becker&quot; dropped out of the top 50 in the ratings, and CBS was set to cancel the series. CBS relented and gave &quot;Becker&quot; a sixth and last season, but was only willing to order thirteen episodes and intended to air it as a midseason replacement. Once again, CBS changed its decision and the last season launched in the fall. Moved to Wednesday nights and aired in tandem with former Monday staple &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, the 129th and final episode of &quot;Becker&quot; was broadcast on January 28, 2004.

<text>Roman Agrarian History and its Significance for Public and Private Law (original German: &quot;Die römische Agrargeschichte in ihrer Bedeutung für das Staats- und Privatrecht&quot;) was the habilitation thesis, in law at the University of Berlin in 1891, of the sociologist Max Weber.

The work examines the economic, social and political development of Roman society through the analysis of Roman writings on agriculture, the methods of land surveying and the terms used to designate the land units in Ancient Rome.

<text>Norman Richard Collins (3 October 1907 – 6 September 1982) was a British writer, and later a radio and television executive, who became one of the major figures behind the establishment of the Independent Television (ITV) network in the UK. This was the first organisation to break the BBC&#x27;s broadcasting monopoly when it began transmitting in 1955.

== Early life ==
Only son and youngest of three children of publisher&#x27;s clerk and illustrator Oliver Norman Collins (d. 1917/18) and Lizzie Ethel (née Nicholls), Collins was born at Beaconsfield. He had a French-Huguenot background on his father&#x27;s side and Welsh farming stock on his mother&#x27;s. He was educated at a school founded by William Ellis at Gospel Oak, Hampstead.

==Early career in publishing, the press and the BBC==
Collins left the British education system aged eighteen, and began his career as an editorial assistant at the Oxford University Press in London. He left this job in 1930 after a dispute over his low salary. He went on to work under Robert Lynd as a literary editor on the London &quot;News Chronicle&quot; newspaper and also had a spell as literary editor of the &quot;Daily News&quot;. At the age of 23 he joined Victor Gollancz&#x27;s publishing firm that was founded in 1927, where he became deputy chairman. In 1941 he joined the BBC as an assistant in the Overseas Talks Department, and then as a producer for BBC Radio.

Meanwhile, he wrote novels, publishing several successful works such as &quot;London Belongs to Me&quot; (which was later filmed) in the 1930s and 1940s. After 1935 he worked in broadcasting as a producer for BBC Radio. In 1946 he was appointed Controller of the Light Programme, the BBC&#x27;s more populist, entertainment-based radio service which had grown out of the BBC Forces Programme first established to entertain allied troops, but which had also become hugely popular with domestic audiences, during the Second World War.

At the Light Programme he created two of the most iconic programmes in the history of British radio broadcasting. The first of these was the adventure series &quot;Dick Barton: Special Agent&quot;, which ran for 711 episodes between 1946 and 1951, following the adventures of a dashing secret agent. The series, broadcast in the early evening just after the main news bulletin, was phenomenally popular and drew 15 million listeners at its peak, being fondly remembered and occasionally revived for many years afterwards. The second famous programme Collins initiated was the notably long-lived &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, first broadcast in 1946 and still running every weekday on BBC Radio 4.

Collins&#x27; huge success as Controller of the Light Programme led to his appointment in 1947 as Controller of the BBC Television Service, during which time it began to take its first steps into becoming a truly mass medium, with television licence numbers breaking into six figures for the first time. This was helped by the extension of broadcasting beyond London with the opening of transmitters in other major cities such as Birmingham, and also by the appeal of the programming Collins and his team were able to offer. Perhaps the high point of his time in control of the channel was the broadcasting live on television of much of the 1948 Olympic Games, being held predominantly in London at Wembley Stadium, where the majority of the BBC&#x27;s television cameras were placed for the duration of the games.

Despite a generally successful tenure as Controller, Collins resigned from the BBC in October 1950, when one of the corporation&#x27;s radio executives, George Barnes, was appointed as his superior – he believed that he, as Controller of Television, should not have to answer to a man whose background was in sound broadcasting. Collins left the BBC with a strong desire to see the establishment of a televisual competitor to the corporation, which since the 1920s had held a complete monopoly on broadcasting in the UK, both radio and television.

==Campaigning for competition==

To this end, Collins and some financial backers established a company called High Definition Films Limited in 1951, the stated aim of which was to improve the telerecording process (by which television programmes were recorded onto film for repeat broadcasts, sales or posterity), but which in reality functioned as an official group to lobby for competition in television broadcasting.

In 1953, Collins and two of his business partners – Robert Renwick and C.O. Stanley (of the Pye electronics firm) – together with several others, formed the Popular Television Association, campaigning more publicly for the establishment of an independent broadcaster, writing to the government to point out the inherent dangers of a single broadcaster holding a monopoly as the BBC did, and making an equally strong campaign in the press. Their lobbying was successful, and in early 1954 the government passed the Television Act, which opened the way for the creation of the new network under the auspices of the newly formed Independent Television Authority (ITA).

==Founding ATV==

When the ITA invited bids from interested companies for the various local franchises that would make up the ITV network, Collins, Renwick and Stanley formed a new company, Associated Broadcasting Development Company Limited (ABDC) to apply for one of the franchises. ABDC&#x27;s bid was reliant on them winning the main London franchise – at this time, the ITV franchises for the major regions (London, Midlands and the North) were split into two, one for Mondays to Fridays and one for weekends. However, when they won only the London weekend and Midlands Monday to Friday licences, their backers withdrew and the ITA prohibited Collins and his colleagues accepting extra funding from the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper.

An answer was found in the form of a merger with Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment, which had failed to win a franchise of its own as the ITA was afraid such a powerful organisation would dominate the other network companies. The new company thus formed was initially called the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC), but rival franchise holder the Associated British Picture Corporation pointed out that they already held rights to the name ABC (which they wished to use for ABC Weekend TV), so Associated TeleVision (ATV) was decided upon as a substitute.

Collins took on the role of Deputy Chairman of ATV, but was effectively sidelined by the force of personality of the company&#x27;s other senior directors, Prince Littler and Lew Grade.

==Personal life==
In 1931 Collins married actress Sarah Helen, daughter of Arthur Francis Martin; they had two daughters and one son.

<doc id="694388" wikidata="Q2610228" url="?curid=694388" title="Skania">
<text>Skania is a Cambrian fossil arthropod. The type species, &quot;S. fragillis&quot;, is known from the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada. A second possible species &quot;&quot;S.&quot; sundbergi&quot; is known from the Kaili Formation of China, but its placement within the genus has been questioned.

== Description ==

Specimens of &quot;S. fragillis&quot; range in length from The cordiform dorsal shield/carapace covers the entire body, with its midline having a raised keel. The shield curls around the front to form a doublure, with the posterior edge of the doublure having a pair of lateral spines. A pair of spines is also present on the posterior of the dorsal shield. A hypostome was present on the underside of the head. There are two sets of appendages, the first 5 pairs of appendages are elongate, the first one of which is described as an antenna and has small subquadrate segments/podomeres, while the others have elongate subrectangular segments. These appendages are somewhat curved and extend beyond the shield. In contrast, the trunk appendages are shorter (not extending beyond the shield) and are less curved, and the segments are not preserved. There was a diverticular (digestive) network running through the carapace, along with a central gut tract.

Specimens of &quot;&quot;S.&quot; sundbergi&quot; are on average in length. The midline keel is more strongly pronounced in &quot;&quot;S.&quot; sundbergi.&quot; The spines present in &quot;S. fragillis&quot; are either more weakly developed or absent.

== Taxonomy ==
While previously enigmatic, it is now thought to be a marrellomorph, with both species, regardless of generic placement, belonging to Acercostraca. The resemblance with the Ediacaran organism &quot;Parvancorina,&quot; to which &quot;Skania&quot; had previously been suggested to be closely related as part of the proposed clade &quot;Parvancorinomorpha&quot;,&quot;&quot; is superficial and they are probably not related.

<doc id="694392" wikidata="Q5159238" url="?curid=694392" title="Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany">
<text>Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany (in German: ) is a book written by Maximilian Weber, a German economist and sociologist, in 1892. Note that the original edition was in German and the title can be translated as &quot;Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany&quot;.

In 1890 an association (known as Verein für Socialpolitik) of scholars, government officials and other specialists decided to study the situation of landowners in Germany. Weber assumed responsibility for reviewing data from German provinces east of the Elbe River.

The situation in that part of Germany was influenced by the influx of migratory workers from Eastern Europe, with special regards to Poles and Russians, while the German labourers wanted to increase their upward social mobility, especially by changing the traditional labour relations of that region (workers could only become labourers on annual contract).

However, their demands and expectations were actually putting them in a weaker position regarding the economic struggle for survival, as they were less competitive than migratory workers.

Weber analyzed those changing labour relations as a symptom of widespread changes in the entire German society.

<text>Sir George Reginald Barnes (13 September 1904 – 22 September 1960) was a British broadcasting executive, who was a station Controller of both BBC Radio and later BBC Television in the 1940s and 1950s. He was Principal of the University College of North Staffordshire, now Keele University, from 1956 to 1960.

==Early life==
He was born in Byfleet, Surrey, England. After spells at the Royal Naval Colleges in Osborne and later Dartmouth, he attended King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, from 1922 to 1927.

==Career==
After Cambridge he returned to Dartmouth as a Master at the school there till 1930. After a short spell at the Cambridge University Press he then joined the BBC in 1935 as a Producer in the Talks Department. He produced talks with several high-profile figures, including in 1937 producing what is now the only record of author Virginia Woolf&#x27;s voice in the &#x27;Craftsmanship&#x27; edition of &quot;Words Fail Me&quot; series, broadcast on 29 April 1937. The same year he produced four talks by William Butler Yeats.

In 1946 he was promoted to be the first ever Controller of the new BBC Radio station, the Third Programme, which still exists today in the form of BBC Radio 3, as it was renamed in 1967. He held this position for four years before in October 1950 becoming the Director of BBC Television. His appointment caused the resignation of the Controller of Programmes, Norman Collins, who disagreed with a man whose background was in sound broadcasting being appointed as his superior in the television service.

It was under his tenure as Director that interest in television exploded, particularly with the screening of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Drawing an audience of an estimated 20 million British and 300 million worldwide viewers – an unprecedented viewership – the Coronation broadcast, when viewed later by the Queen, caused her to knight Barnes on the spot at the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove Studios. Television coverage was now nationwide, although in 1955 the service was faced with the prospect of competition for the first time when the rival ITV network was launched.

Barnes retired from broadcasting in 1956, becoming Principal of the University College of North Staffordshire, now Keele University.

==Personal life==
In 1927 he married Dorothy Anne, daughter of Henry Bond, Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge 1919–1929. He died at Keele in 1960, aged 56, leaving his wife, Anne, and their son Anthony.

Law&quot;, as Dr. Alan Feinstone in &quot;The Dentist&quot;, as retired police detective Henry Spencer on the USA Network comedy-drama series &quot;Psych&quot;, and as Roger Dorn in the films &quot;Major League&quot;, &quot;Major League II&quot;, and &quot;Major League: Back to the Minors&quot;. He also appeared regularly on &quot;The Resident&quot;, &quot;The Curse&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and &quot;Cuts&quot;, and has had intermittent appearances on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

== Early life ==
Bernsen was born in North Hollywood, the eldest son of producer Harry Bernsen Jr. and soap actress Jeanne Cooper. He graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1972. Bernsen is also a &quot;double Bruin&quot;, having received both a BA in Theatre Arts in 1977 and an MFA in Playwriting in 1979 from UCLA.

== Career ==

=== Acting ===
After a two-year appearance on the soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, Bernsen was cast as lawyer Arnold Becker on the Steven Bochco television series &quot;L.A. Law&quot; in 1986. The series became a hit, and the role earned him Emmy and Golden Globe nominations, appearances on magazine covers, and guest-starring roles on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. He remained on &quot;L.A. Law&quot; for the entire run of the show, until it ended in 1994. He played the lead actor in the two-season, NASA-themed series &quot;The Cape&quot; in 1996–97. 

Bernsen appeared with British actor Bruce Payne in the films &quot;Kounterfeit&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He starred as the title character, Dr. Alan Feinstone, in the horror film &quot;The Dentist&quot; and its sequel. Bernsen was also cast as &quot;prima donna&quot; third baseman Roger Dorn in the sports comedy &quot;Major League&quot; and appeared in both of the film&#x27;s sequels. Bernsen portrayed John Durant on &quot;General Hospital&quot; from September 2004 until the character was murdered in May 2006.

Bernsen played Jack Sherwood on &quot;Cuts&quot;, appeared twice on &quot;Celebrity Mole&quot;, and played a lawyer on &quot;Boston Legal&quot;. He appeared as another Q on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. He also had a recurring role as Captain Owen Sebring on the military drama &quot;JAG&quot; and played a Republican senator in two episodes of &quot;The West Wing&quot;. He directed, produced, and appeared in the horror film &quot;Dead Air&quot;. Bernsen also co-starred in USA&#x27;s &quot;Psych&quot;, playing the role of Henry Spencer, the father of the main character, Shawn Spencer (James Roday). In the film &quot;Rust&quot;, Bernsen plays a former minister who returns to his hometown.
Bernsen appeared in &quot;25 Hill&quot;, a film he produced, directed and wrote, which is centered on the All-American Soap Box Derby, and at one time was planning a baseball movie about zombies, called &quot;Three Strikes, You&#x27;re Dead&quot;.

He also appeared as a guest star in one episode of &quot;Switched at Birth&quot;, the ABC Family television series. Bernsen currently appears as Kyle Nevin on the television series &quot;The Resident&quot;.

=== Producing ===

Bernsen was president and co-owner of Public Media Works, a new media company that develops entertainment for targeted fan bases. He directed and starred in &quot;Carpool Guy&quot;, the company&#x27;s first film; it was targeted at soap opera fans and released on DVD in 2005.

Bernsen then went on to form Team Cherokee Productions. According to the book &quot;One Red Paperclip&quot;, in June 2006, Bernsen traded a role in the film &quot;Donna on Demand&quot; to Kyle MacDonald for a snow globe of the band KISS. It was this role that MacDonald eventually traded for a two-story farmhouse.

In recent years, Bernsen focused on stories that explore aspects of Christian faith in today&#x27;s world and how that can contribute to, but also tends to divide our common humanity. His first such film was &quot;Rust&quot;, released in 2010 by Sony Pictures. Bernsen, along with producing partner Chris Aronoff, formed Home Theater Films, an independent production company that develops, produces, and markets films and television shows. &quot;25 Hill,&quot; the company&#x27;s first title, was released in July 2012. This was followed by &quot;3 Day Test&quot; (2012), &quot;Beyond the Heavens&quot; (2013), and &quot;Life with Dog&quot; (2017). Their film &quot;Mary 4 Mayor&quot; was due out in the fall of 2020.

=== Writing ===
In October 2015, the Pelican Book Group released Bernsen&#x27;s debut novel. The book, &quot;Rust: the Novel&quot;, is an adaptation of Bernsen&#x27;s 2010 feature film, &quot;Rust&quot;, in which he played the main character and served as writer and director. Bernsen and his wife, Amanda Pays, have co-authored two books, &quot;Change Houses, Not Spouses&quot; and &quot;Open House: Reinventing Space for Simple Living&quot;, a coffee table book featuring remodeling and design ideas they have learned from remodeling their own homes.

== Personal life ==
Bernsen was married to Brenda Cooper from 1983 to 1987. Bernsen has been married to British actress Amanda Pays since 1988. They have four sons: Oliver, Angus, Henry, and Finley. Pays and Bernsen moved to the Hudson Valley in upstate New York in 2019 where he now focuses on film and television projects that can be shot locally.

Bernsen has one of the largest snow globe collections in the world, with over 8,000 globes. One notable globe in his collection is a KISS motorized snow globe, that Kyle MacDonald traded him for in exchange for a speaking role in the film &quot;Donna on Demand&quot;. This was part of the famous &quot;One Red Paperclip&quot; series of trades, which saw MacDonald go from a red paperclip to eventually owning a farmhouse in Saskatchewan.

He is a Christian as revealed in promoting his film &quot;Christian Mingle&quot;.

<text>Joseph Raymond &quot;Toots&quot; Mondt (January 18, 1894 – June 11, 1976) was an American professional wrestler and promoter who revolutionized the wrestling industry in the early to mid-1920s and co-promoted the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Some of the stars Mondt helped create from the 1920s through the 1960s included Wayne Munn, Jim Londos, Antonino Rocca, Bruno Sammartino, Stu Hart and Cowboy Bill Watts.

==Early life==
Joseph Raymond Mondt was born in Garden Grove, Iowa, on January 18, 1894. Joseph (Joe) Toots was his professional name. Toots&#x27; father, Frank, was a farmer and building contractor. The Mondt family moved to Weld County, Colorado, in 1904.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early wrestling career===
Toots Mondt made his wrestling debut in Greeley in 1912 at the age of 18 in a carnival/wrestling style match, a match he would wrestle in for many years. Stu Hart claimed he ran into Toots by chance while wrestling in New York City and that Mondt said he received his first wrestling lesson in 1916 from Jack Taylor, and Mondt tried to recruit Hart into a territory in Washington, D.C. Around this time, he also tried his hand at acrobatics. However, this was an unsuccessful move and Toots returned to wrestling matches. Toots received his big break when he was discovered by wrestling pioneer Farmer Burns during one of his scouting trips. The nickname ‘Toots’, had to do with either his small feet or his relative youth and . Mondt was the youngest wrestler in Farmer Burns&#x27; camp.

===Gold Dust Trio===

Until 1919, wrestling matches were slow-moving exhibitions mainly confined to the mat and lasting on an average 60 minutes. Crowds no longer found this to be suitable entertainment and accordingly, they began to dwindle. Wrestling matches slowly and eventually became pre-determined. Toots Mondt joined the camp of Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis with the recommendation of Farmer Burns. Toots served in many capacities as a sparring partner, trainer, sometimes as an opponent and as a police officer. As a sparring partner and trainer, Toots Mondt helped Ed Lewis develop new holds and counters. The working relationship and unity amongst wrestling promoters was beginning to wear thin and crowd attendance was still low. Toots conceived a solution and combined features of a boxing ring, Greco-Roman, freestyle wrestling, and the old-time lumber camp-style of fighting. Toots had called it ’Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling’.

Toots Mondt&#x27;s second plan was to promote this new style of wrestling on a much higher scale. Toots convinced Ed Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow of forming their own promotion as opposed to having different promoters controlling them. The team of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow used their connections to convince many other wrestlers to sign up. Under the control of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow, they served as bookers and agents. Toots also instituted time limits as wrestling matches would often go three or four hours. Within six months, the &quot;Gold Dust Trio&quot; controlled the course of professional wrestling in North America. Their product was moved out from venues such as burlesque theaters and back alley halls to the major sports venue in each city. All new talent was tested in Billy Sandow&#x27;s private ring while routines and finishes were carefully determined by Toots. The Gold Dust Trio later dissolved from a power struggle between Toots Mondt &amp; Billy Sandow&#x27;s brother Max.

Mondt then formed a partnership with Philadelphia promoter, Ray Fabiani. The new combination wasted little time and found their new title holder in Dick Shikat, a former circus strongman from Germany. Once Dick Shickat&#x27;s title reign had run its course, Mondt and Fabiani made Jim Londos their new champion and continued their hold on the Northeast. They soon expanded onto New York City, Hartford, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Toots/Fabiani were unsuccessful because rival New York promoter Jack Curley prevented them from promoting in NYC for years, and it was during this time that he came around an up-and-coming Lou Thesz, with whom Mondt had a bad history. As Jack Curley was on his deathbed, Toots realized that New York wrestling would fall apart. So Toots &amp; Fabiani immediately formed an alliance with fellow booking heavyweight Rudy Dusek. This formation to take over New York was kept a secret. At Curley&#x27;s funeral, one of his sons approached Toots about taking over New York and was not aware that Toots had a plan. Toots also gained help from other bookers such as Jack Pfeffer, the Johnston Brothers and Jess McMahon. Jess McMahon worked for boxing promoter and New York Rangers hockey franchise founder Tex Rickard, who despised wrestling and prevented bookings in Madison Square Garden (MSG) from 1939 to 1948. Toots found former wrestler turned millionaire Bernarr McFadden, who gave Toots the financial backings.

Bernarr McFadden helped Toots promote in NYC and gain access into Madison Square Garden. In 1948, in the main event of the first card held in MSG for 9 years, Gorgeous George defeated Ernie Dusek. In that same year Toots Mondt was in search for another champion. After several failed attempts, Toots Mondt found Antonino Rocca, who brought in more Latino fans to the matches which financially favored Toots. Mondt, however, was not able to keep Rocca happy and Vincent J. McMahon was brought into the scene by Ray Fabiani.

In 1954, Mondt signed up Rafael Halperin a rabbi from Israel who wrestled in a blue and white costume emblazoned with the Jewish star.

===Birth of the World Wide Wrestling Federation===
In 1963, Toots Mondt and Vincent J. McMahon broke away from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), renaming Capitol Wrestling Corporation to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). Toots Mondt parted ways with NWA President Sam Muchnick on good terms so that the WWWF would not be seen as an enemy. Toots and Vince were also in the middle of fighting off an invasion by Jim Crockett Promotions from promoting in the WWWF territories.

When Buddy Rogers was crowned NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Toots controlled the bookings for Rogers’ title defenses. Toots would rarely allow Buddy Rogers to defend the title outside the Northeastern region. This would be one of the factors which led to the World Wide Wrestling Federation splitting from the NWA. In April 1963, Buddy Rogers was awarded the WWWF World Heavyweight title, supposedly for winning a tournament for the title in Rio de Janeiro, a fictitious storyline created by Toots Mondt. In 1965, Toots Mondt stepped down as promoter at Madison Square Garden and Vincent J. McMahon took over. When Bruno Sammartino was brought into the WWWF, Vincent J. McMahon predicted that he would be a midcarder for two or three years at best. Toots called Sammartino the future of the company because people instantly liked and responded to him. Toots convinced Vincent J. McMahon to build the company around Bruno Sammartino. In a June 2012 Wrestling Observer Radio podcast, Bruno acknowledged that Mondt and Vincent J. McMahon were not on the best of terms during his tenure with the company, with Bruno suggesting it was due to the fallout over the promotion&#x27;s handling of Buddy Rogers.

Changing times and the rise of television saw Mondt&#x27;s influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able to get a handle on television like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt&#x27;s gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capitol. Mondt died on June 11, 1976, at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness. Since then, he has been inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017 as a recipient of its Legacy Award.

<doc id="694405" wikidata="Q250954" url="?curid=694405" title="Beloved (1998 film)">
<text>Beloved is a 1998 American gothic psychological horror drama film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, and Thandiwe Newton. Based on Toni Morrison&#x27;s 1987 novel of the same name, the plot centers on a formerly enslaved woman after the American Civil War, her haunting by a poltergeist, and the visitation of her reincarnated daughter. This was the first film produced by Harpo Films.

&quot;Beloved&quot; received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design for Colleen Atwood. The film garnered mostly positive reviews, and both Danny Glover and Kimberly Elise received praise for their performances.

==Plot==
Sethe is a former slave living on the outskirts of Cincinnati, Ohio shortly after the Civil War. An angry poltergeist residing in the family home terrorizes her and her three children, causing two of them to run away forever.

Eight years later, Sethe lives alone with her daughter, Denver. Paul D, an old friend from Sweet Home, the plantation Sethe had escaped from years earlier, finds her home and drives off the angry spirit that inhabits it. Afterwards, he proposes he stay and Sethe responds favorably. Shortly after Paul D. moves in, a clean young woman named Beloved, who appears to have a cognitive delay, finds her way into Sethe&#x27;s yard, and Sethe takes her in.

Denver is initially happy to have Beloved around, but learns that she is Sethe&#x27;s reincarnated daughter. Nonetheless, she chooses not to tell Beloved&#x27;s origins to Sethe. One night, Beloved, aware that Paul D dislikes her, immobilizes him with a spell, and rapes him. He resolves to tell Sethe what happened, but instead asks her to have a baby with him. When Stamp Paid, a co-worker of Paul D who has known her for many years, learns of Paul D&#x27;s plans for a family with Sethe, he pulls a newspaper clipping featuring Sethe and tells her story to the illiterate Paul D.

Years ago, Sethe was raped by the nephews of Schoolteacher, the owner of Sweet Home. She complained to Mrs. Garner, his sister-in-law, who confronted him. In retaliation, Schoolteacher and his nephews brutally whipped Sethe, leaving a &quot;tree&quot; of keloid scars on her back. Heavily pregnant with her fourth child, Sethe planned to escape. Her other children were sent off earlier to live with Baby Suggs, her mother-in-law, but Sethe stayed behind to look for her husband, Halle. She was assaulted while searching for him in the barn. The Schoolteacher&#x27;s nephews held her down, raped her, and forcibly took her breast milk.

When Halle failed to appear, Sethe ran off alone. She crossed paths with Amy Denver, a white girl who treated her injuries and delivered her child, whom she named after her. Sethe eventually reached Baby Suggs&#x27; home, but her initial happiness was short-lived when Schoolteacher came to claim Sethe and her children.

In desperation, Sethe slit her older daughter&#x27;s throat, and attempted to kill her other children. Stamp Paid managed to stop her and the disgusted Schoolteacher departed. Sethe is detained for an unknown amount of time, and it is later revealed she was saved from hanging by the prominent Cincinnati family the Bodwins, who knew Baby Suggs.

Paul D, horrified by the revelation and suddenly understanding the origin of the poltergeist, confronts Sethe. She unapologetically justifies herself, insisting her children are better off dead than enslaved. Paul D. departs shortly thereafter in protest. Afterwards, Sethe realizes that Beloved is the reincarnation of her dead daughter.

Elated yet guilty, Sethe spoils Beloved with elaborate gifts while neglecting Denver. Beloved soon throws a destructive tantrum and her malevolent presence causes living conditions in the house to deteriorate. The women live in squalor and Sethe is unable to work, having become physically and mentally drained by Beloved&#x27;s parasitic nature. Denver becomes depressed yet, inspired by a memory of her grandmother&#x27;s confidence in her, she musters the courage to seek employment.

Once Denver gets work with the Bodwins, women from the local church visit Sethe&#x27;s to perform an exorcism. They do this partly from guilt; years before, they hadn&#x27;t warned Sethe of Schoolteacher&#x27;s impending arrival. They are comforting the family, praying and singing loudly when Denver&#x27;s new employer arrives to pick her up for work. Sethe sees him and, reminded of Schoolteacher&#x27;s arrival, attacks him with an icepick, but is subdued by Denver and the women. During the commotion, Beloved disappears completely and Sethe, freed from Beloved&#x27;s grip, becomes permanently bedridden.

Some months later, Paul D encounters Denver at the marketplace. She has become a confident and mature young woman. Arriving at Sethe&#x27;s he finds her suffering from a deep malaise. He assures Sethe that he and Denver will now take care of her. She tells him she doesn&#x27;t see the point, as Beloved, her &quot;best thing&quot;, is gone. Paul D disagrees, telling Sethe that she herself is her own best thing.

==Cast==

Additionally, Jonathan Demme regular Charles Napier has a cameo as an angry carnie.

==Production==
Prior to Morrison&#x27;s receipt of the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Beloved&quot;, Winfrey purchased the rights to the novel in 1987; the translation to film then occurred a decade later. There was a conflict over screenplay credit with Akosua Busia demanding sole credit and saying Adam Brooks and Richard LaGravenese got too much. WGA gave credit to all three. Busia said they were all little more than script doctors.

===Filming locations===
Street scenes were filmed in the Old City and Manayunk neighborhoods of Philadelphia. Some other scenes were shot on a soundstage in the city&#x27;s disused (and later demolished) Civic Center.

Shooting also took place on the north side of the Schuylkill River within Valley Forge National Historical Park in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and at the Landis Valley Museum in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

Shooting was done in a field in Fair Hill Natural Resources Management Area in Cecil County, Maryland, at a spot just east of Big Elk Creek and just south of the border with Chester County, Pennsylvania. The State of Maryland subsequently compiled a location map and photographs of the buildings constructed for the film in Fair Hill NRMA.

Filming locations also included New Castle, Delaware.

===Praise for Winfrey===
During promotion of the film, Thandiwe Newton said to &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, &quot;Here we were working on this project with the heavy underbelly of political and social realism, and she managed to lighten things up ... I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of good actors, and I know Oprah hasn&#x27;t made many films. I was stunned. She&#x27;s a very strong technical actress and it&#x27;s because she&#x27;s so smart. She&#x27;s acute. She&#x27;s got a mind like a razor blade.&quot;

== Box office ==
&quot;Beloved&quot; did not come close to making back its $80 million budget. It grossed only $8,165,551 on its opening weekend, ranking #5, and was beaten by the horror movie &quot;Bride of Chucky&quot;, which ranked #2 and grossed approximately $11,830,855 on the same weekend. Oprah Winfrey went on public record stating that she ate of macaroni and cheese when she was informed the Saturday after the movie opened that &quot;we got beat by something called &quot;Chucky&quot;.&quot; She also claimed that &quot;Beloved&quot;&#x27;s failure at the box office was the worst moment in her career and resulted in her suffering a major depression. &quot;It was the only time in my life that I was ever depressed, and I recognised that I (was) depressed because I&#x27;ve done enough shows (on the topic). &#x27;Oh, this is what people must feel like who are depressed.&#x27;&quot;

Director Jonathan Demme commented: &quot;&quot;Beloved&quot; only played in theaters for four weeks. It made $22 million — I think that&#x27;s a lot of money. And the only reason it left theaters after a month was because the Disney corporation that released the picture wanted all the &quot;Beloved&quot; theaters — where we were doing very well, in a number of situations — but the Walt Disney company wanted those theaters for Adam Sandler&#x27;s &quot;Waterboy&quot;. So, we were told that they were gonna bring us back at the end of the year, and they didn&#x27;t. But the picture did very respectfully. It was in the top ten its whole life.&quot;

The film remained in theaters into the holiday season and, by December 27, 1998, had grossed $22,746,521. The film later returned to theaters for two weeks in March 1999, grossing an additional $110,000. It was no longer listed in the top 10 on the box office chart by the November 6–8 weekend and had dropped to the rank of 12 on the chart by then.

==Critical reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Beloved&quot; is currently assigned a 72% &quot;fresh&quot; rating based on 127 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.5 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;A powerful, emotional and successful film adaptation of the original novel.&quot; It has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 critic reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film 3½ stars out of 4, praising its cast and emotional weight of the storylines. He wrote that its nonlinear narrative &quot;coils through past and present, through memory and hallucination, giving us shards of events that we are required to piece back together. It is not an easy film to follow. ... The complexity is not simply a stylistic device; it is built out of Sethe&#x27;s memories, and the ones at the core are so painful that her mind circles them warily, afraid to touch.&quot;

Comparing the film and the novel to the Henry James&#x27; novella &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, he noted the use of supernatural elements &quot;to touch on deep feelings&quot; as well as the deliberate lack of a final explanation. He added, &quot;Spirit manifestations come from madness and need not follow logical agendas. It is a remarkable and brave achievement for Demme and his producer and star, Winfrey, to face this difficult material head-on and not try to dumb it down into a more accessible, less evocative form.&quot;

He also expressed the view that some of the audience &quot;will not like it–will find it confusing or too convoluted. And it does not provide the kind of easy lift at the end that they might expect. Sethe&#x27;s tragic story is the kind where the only happy ending is that it is over.&quot;

<text>Cecil McGivern CBE (22 May 1907, in Newcastle, England – 30 January 1963, in Buckinghamshire, England) was a British broadcasting executive, who initially worked for BBC Radio before transferring to BBC Television in the late 1940s. From 1950 to 1957 he served as the Controller of BBC Television Service, succeeding Norman Collins.

== Early life and career ==
The son of Irish immigrants, McGivern was educated at St Cuthbert&#x27;s Grammar School and later attended Durham University. His initial ambition was to be an actor (he played the central role in the première of the thriller &quot;Land&#x27;s End&quot; at the People&#x27;s Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1935), but he quickly realised that he lacked the necessary talent and so pursued a career as a teacher instead. He did, however, continue working in the theatre as a producer of amateur productions.

== Career ==
McGivern joined the BBC in 1936, working as a producer of drama and documentary programmes in his native Newcastle and also in Manchester. In 1939, he was promoted to occupy the newly created position of programmes director for the North East of England. However, he only held this post for a short time before being seconded to the BBC in London after the outbreak of war, to become part of a group of producers working on war-related programming. During World War II, he wrote and directed several acclaimed radio documentary features, such as &quot;Bombers Over Berlin&quot;, &quot;The Harbour Called Mulberry&quot;, &quot;Fighter Pilot&quot;, and &quot;Junction X&quot;.

Following the end of the war in 1945, McGivern left the staff of the BBC to join the Rank Organisation film company, where he worked as a screenwriter. Probably the best-known film on which he worked for the company was &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946), starring John Mills. The script was nominated for the Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay.

Despite this success in the film industry, however, in 1947, McGivern returned to the BBC, this time working for the BBC Television Service based at Alexandra Palace. As programme director, he worked under the station&#x27;s controller, Norman Collins, to establish the popularity of the fledgling channel, with one of the major events covered during this time being the 1948 Summer Olympics, broadcast live by the BBC from Wembley Stadium in London. After Collins left the BBC in 1950 in protest at George Barnes being appointed as his superior, McGivern was elevated to succeed him as controller of programmes.

McGivern&#x27;s period in Control of the channel&#x27;s output saw a rapid increase of the television service&#x27;s popularity, helped greatly by the 20 million audience for the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. However, his tenure also saw the arrival of a commercial competitor, ITV, in 1955, breaking the BBC&#x27;s broadcasting monopoly. In 1957 he was promoted to become the deputy director of BBC Television, but when this post was abolished in a reorganisation of the television service&#x27;s management structure in 1961, he elected to once more leave the BBC rather than take the scriptwriting post he had been offered.

He joined ITV&#x27;s northern weekday franchise holder Granada Television as an executive producer.

== Death ==
In January 1963 McGivern was involved in an accident late at night at his home in Buckinghamshire, setting fire to his clothes while attempting to light a cigarette. He was badly burned and died in hospital on 30 January 1963, with the coroner later recording an official verdict of death by misadventure.

== Awards and honours ==
In 1954, he was appointed a CBE for his services to broadcasting, and in 1962 received the Desmond Davis Award for Services to Television.

<doc id="694413" wikidata="Q46874" url="?curid=694413" title="Bobbie Rosenfeld">
<text>Fanny &quot;Bobbie&quot; Rosenfeld (December 28, 1904 – November 14, 1969) was a Canadian athlete, who won a gold medal for the 4x100-metre relay and a silver medal for the 100-metre at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. She was a star at basketball, hockey, softball, and tennis; and was called Bobbie for her &quot;bobbed&quot; haircut. In 1949, named Rosenfeld the &quot;Canadian woman athlete of the half-century.&quot; The Bobbie Rosenfeld Award is named in her honour. In 1996, she was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Rosenfeld, who was Jewish, was born on December 18, 1904, in Ekaterinoslav, Russian Empire (now Dnipro, Ukraine). When she was an infant, she immigrated to Barrie, Canada with her parents and older brother. Her father, Max Rosenfeld, operated a junk business and her mother Sarah, who gave birth to three more girls, ran the home.

Fanny attended Central School and Barrie Collegiate Institute, where she excelled in sports, including basketball, softball, lacrosse, hockey, and tennis.

In 1922, the Rosenfeld family moved to Toronto, where Fanny worked at a chocolate factory.

Rosenfeld died on November 13, 1969, in Toronto and is buried at Lambton Mills Cemetery in Humber Valley Village.

==Athletic career==
Rosenfeld played and competed in numerous sports, including track and field, ice hockey, basketball, fastball, softball, lacrosse, golf, speed skating, and tennis. When commenting on Rosenfeld&#x27;s diverse sporting career, one author wrote, &quot;The most efficient way to summarize Bobbie Rosenfeld&#x27;s career... is to say that she was not good at swimming.&quot;

In 1949, Rosenfeld was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, one of the first women to receive the honor. In 1950, she was &quot;bestowed the Canadian woman athlete of the first half-century award.&quot;

In 1978, &quot;The Canadian Press&quot; began presenting the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award, an annual award given to Canada&#x27;s female athlete of the year.

===Basketball===
After Rosenfeld&#x27;s family moved to Toronto in 1922, she joined Toronto&#x27;s Young Women&#x27;s Hebrew Association (YWHA) and was a center for their basketball team. That year, the team won both the Toronto and Ontario championships.

===Hockey===
Rosenfeld was a hockey player in the 1920s and was dubbed superwoman of ladies&#x27; hockey. In 1924, she helped form the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association (LOHA).

Rosenfeld competed on a championship hockey team after debuting as a track and field athlete at the 1928 Summer Olympics. She was a centre on the 1927 and 1929 Ontario champion Toronto Patterson Pats, which were part of the North Toronto Ladies&#x27; City League. She was considered the most outstanding women&#x27;s hockey player in all of Ontario between 1931 and 1932.

===Softball===
Rosenfeld competed on a championship softball team after debuting as a track and field athlete at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

===Tennis===
In 1924, Rosenfeld claimed the title of the Toronto Ladies Grass Court Tennis championship, despite having only just taken up the sport.

===Track and field===
In 1923, Rosenfeld&#x27;s softball teammates encouraged her to enter a track competition at a sporting carnival in Beaverton. She entered a dash and defeated the Canadian champion, Rosa Grosse. Later that year, she began training more intensely and competed at the Canadian National Exhibition, as well as Ontario’s first women&#x27;s track and field championship.

At the 1925 Ontario Ladies Track and Field championships, in a single day performance, Rosenfeld placed first in discus, shot put, dash, low hurdles, and long jump, and placed second in the javelin and dash. In the mid-1920s, she held national records in the open relay with a CNE relay team, as well as in the standing broad jump, discus, javelin, and shot put.

==== Olympics ====
During the trials for the 1928 Summer Olympics, Rosenfeld set numerous Canadian track and field records. These records included the running broad jump, standing broad jump and the discus. Her time in the 100 metres was four-fifths of a second slower than the world record at that time.

She later competed as a sprinter in the 1928 Olympics, the first Games in which women were allowed to compete in track and field. Her team won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay. She received a silver medal in the dash and placed fifth in the dash. She &quot;scored more points for her country than any other athlete at the Games, male or female.&quot;

==Retirement ==
One year after competing in the Olympic Games, Rosenfeld developed severe arthritis, The condition forced her to stop competing in 1933, though she continued to be involved in sports as &quot;a coach, executive or manager to various women&#x27;s sports teams.&quot;

=== Sport involvement ===
In 1934, Rosenfeld was coach of the Canadian women&#x27;s track and field team at the British Commonwealth Games in London, England.

From 1934 to 1939, Rosenfeld was president of the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association. By late 1936, she served as the organization&#x27;s president, secretary, and treasurer. From 1937 to 1939, she also served as president of the Dominion Women&#x27;s Amateur Hockey Association, following Myrtle Cook-McGowan and succeeded by Mary Dunn.

In the spring of 1939, Rosenfeld was the manager of Langley&#x27;s Lakesides softball team. The team played an exhibition game in front of 14,000 fans at Madison Square Garden.

=== Journalism ===
In 1937, Rosenfeld turned her attention to journalism. She worked as a sports columnist for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; for approximately twenty years, advocating for greater participation of women in sports and more girls&#x27; physical education programs in schools. In 1937, she introduced a column called &quot;Feminine Sports Reel,&quot; where she &quot;covered not only sports news, but also countered the stereotype that sports made women unfeminine.&quot; For 18 years, Rosenfeld covered women&#x27;s sports. Her last column appeared on December 3, 1958, but she continued to work for the newspaper until 1966.

== Quotes ==

We are taking up the sword, and high time it is in defense of our so-called athletic bodies to give the lie to those pen flourishers who depict us not as paragons of feminine physique, beauty and health, but rather as Amazons and ugly ducklings all because we have become sports-minded.&quot; – Fanny Bobbie Rosenfeld (Jewish Women&#x27;s Archives)

<text>Red Baron is a combat flight simulation video game for MS-DOS created by Damon Slye at Dynamix. It was published by Sierra On-Line in 1990. The game was ported for Amiga and Macintosh computers in 1992.

The game is set on the Western Front of World War I. The player can engage in single missions or career mode, flying for either the German Air Service or the Royal Flying Corps. In the course of the game the player might find themselves either flying in the Red Baron&#x27;s squadron Jasta 11, or encountering him as an enemy above the front.

An expansion pack, &quot;Red Baron: Mission Builder&quot;, was released in 1992. A port of the game for the Nintendo 64 was announced, but was later cancelled.

==Gameplay==

Many of the famous German, British, and French combat aircraft of World War I are available to fly including the Fokker E.I Eindecker, the Fokker Dr.I Triplane, the Sopwith Camel, and the SPAD XIII. The game features somewhat unrealistic physics as it was mainly intended as an entertainment game instead of a true flight simulator, although the unique flying characteristics of some of the aircraft were implemented such as the gyroscopic effect created by the Sopwith Camel&#x27;s rotary engine and the Albatros&#x27;s upper wings shearing at high negative G loads. The player also has to deal with problems the real fighter pilots of World War I faced, such as gun jams, flak, engine damage, and possibly bleeding to death if they were wounded and could not land at an aerodrome in time.

There are several types of missions in the game: dogfight; scramble; patrol; balloon busting/protection; reconnaissance escort; and bomber escort/interception; and Zeppelin hunt. There were also recreations of historical missions. The majority of the missions are carried out with one to three wingmen for the player, although the player may choose to fly missions solo if appointed as the flight leader.

* Dogfight: The player&#x27;s squadron faces up with an enemy squadron. The player may choose whether to start the mission near the action or at the aerodrome.
* One-on-one dogfight: If the player scores many victories, an enemy ace may present a challenge to a one-on-one dogfight. Some enemy aces may cheat by taking along wingmen.
* Scramble: An enemy squadron approaches the player&#x27;s aerodrome, and the player&#x27;s squadron must intercept them.
* Patrol: The player patrols the Front. Anti-aircraft artillery and enemy aircraft are usually encountered although the latter does not always happen.
* Balloon Busting/Protection: In balloon busting missions, the player&#x27;s squadron is tasked to eliminate enemy observation balloons. While stationary balloons are easy to destroy and equally qualified as victories, the player will also have to cope with enemy fighters and anti-aircraft weapons. In balloon protection missions, the player has to defend friendly balloons from an enemy squadron. Balloon busting missions may be started from the aerodrome or near the enemy balloons.
* Reconnaissance Escort: The player and wingmen escort one or two reconnaissance aircraft over the Front while enemy fighters try to destroy them.
* Bomber Escort/Interception: Gotha and Handley-Page bombers attack factories or trains. The player either escorts friendly bombers or intercepts and destroys enemy bombers.
* Zeppelin Hunt: Zeppelin dirigibles bomb the English homeland, and it is up to the player to shoot them down. This mission will not happen unless the player is flying on the Allied side.
* Historic Mission: Historic engagements can be relived on either side. Missions include the engagement for which William Bishop received his Victoria Cross and the final dogfight of the Red Baron.

The player can select any mission to fly on either the German or Allied sides. Location, aircraft type, wingmen, and famous aces can also be chosen for the mission.

A career in either the German Air Service or British Royal Flying Corps runs from December 1915 to October 1918, just before the Armistice. As time progresses, the player is transferred to various historical aerodromes in France and in England. The Front also shifts as it did during the War and battles such as Verdun are noted. More advanced aircraft are also introduced in the proper time periods. The player&#x27;s number of aerial kills is kept track of and he is promoted in rank and awarded medals as he progresses, and he can eventually customize the colors of his aircraft. If the player is wounded in combat and is able to land/crash land in friendly territory, they spend several months recuperating from their wounds, but if they end up in enemy territory, they spend several months in a prisoner-of-war camp until they escape back to their side. The timeline continues during the recovery/imprisonment periods, so it is possible that the player will return to duty at a different aerodrome flying newer aircraft.

Depending on how well the player does, they can be assigned to an aerodrome that has a famous ace and can fly missions with them, and depending on the time period and the location of the aerodrome, the player can encounter the famous enemy aces that were in the area during that time period.

A multiplayer version of the game was available on The Sierra Network. Two to four pilots competed in games lasting for ten minutes or three deaths.

==Release==
Sierra acquired Dynamix while &quot;Red Baron&quot; was being developed, and it became the first game in Dynamix&#x27;s &quot;Great Warplanes Series&quot; that Sierra published. The press discussed the competition between &quot;Red Baron&quot; and MicroProse&#x27;s &quot;Knights of the Sky&quot;. In 1997, Sierra officially released the 16-color version of &quot;Red Baron&quot; as a free download on their website as a promotion.

Dynamix ran a contest in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; consisting of 7 questions about the game. The reader had to answer the questions on a and send the answers to Dynamix. The first five readers to get all answers correct received a replica of the Blue Max and an autographed copy of the game.

In October 2013, an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign was started to fund a re-release of &quot;Red Baron&quot;.

&quot;Red Baron&quot; is available for purchase on Steam and GOG.

==Reception==
Slye later said that &quot;Red Baron&quot;″s success made Dynamix become known as a developer of flight simulators. Sierra considered it the first in its &quot;Aces&quot; line of simulations. According to the company, combined sales of &quot;Red Baron&quot;, &quot;Aces of the Pacific&quot;, &quot;Aces Over Europe&quot;, &quot;Aces of the Deep&quot;, and an anthology surpassed one million units by the end of March 1996.

Warren Spector—producer of Origin Systems&#x27;s WW1 simulation &quot;Wings of Glory&quot;—was a fan, calling it &quot;an astonishing accomplishment&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; approved of &quot;Red Baron&quot;″s accurate history and realistic flight models and combat, and option to record missions, ultimately calling it the best flight simulator. In a 1991 survey of World War I flight simulations, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described &quot;Red Baron&quot; as less realistic than &quot;Knights of the Sky&quot;, but with excellent graphics and gameplay. Surveys of strategy and war games that year and in 1993, however, gave it five stars out of five and stated that it was &quot;the best World War I air simulator ever done&quot;, with historical accuracy and superb game play. The magazine gave the &quot;Mission Builder&quot; four stars. A 1993 review of the Sierra Network multiplayer version called it &quot;a real pleasure ... One of the best on-line gaming values yet&quot;. The game got 5 out of 5 stars in &quot;Dragon&quot;. The game sold more than 500,000 units worldwide.

&quot;Red Baron&quot; won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;&#x27;s 1991 Simulation of the Year award, and in 1993 the magazine named the game to its Hall of Fame, stating that it stood as the high watermark of realistic air combat for many gamers. That year the magazine told a reader asking for &quot;the most enjoyable flight simulation game&quot; that &quot;most of us still opt for &quot;Red Baron&quot;&quot;. In 1996, the magazine named &quot;Red Baron&quot; as #4 on its list of the best PC games of all time, positively comparing it to Spectrum HoloByte&#x27;s &quot;Falcon 3.0&quot;.

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Red Baron&quot; as the 17th best computer game ever. In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; placed &quot;Red Baron&quot; on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 20th-best computer game ever released.

<text>Tomb KV6 in Egypt&#x27;s Valley of the Kings is the final resting place of the 20th-Dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses IX. However, the archaeological evidence and the quality of decoration it contains indicates that the tomb was not finished in time for Ramesses&#x27;s death but was hastily rushed through to completion, many corners being cut, following his demise.

It is located in the central part of the Valley. Its unusually wide entrance stands between, and slightly above, those of two other tombs: KV5 and KV55. Running 105 metres into the hillside, the tomb begins with a gate and a shallow descending ramp followed by three successive stretches of corridor. The first of these has four side chambers – two on each side – but none of these are decorated or finished.

At the end of the corridors come three chambers. The first of these is decorated with the Opening of the mouth ritual, and it is possible that a well shaft would have been dug here had the builders been afforded more time. The second chamber contains four large columns, but neither the cutting nor the decoration work were completed. At the far end of this chamber, a ramp slopes down to the burial chamber, where the pharaoh&#x27;s sarcophagus was placed (the floor has a rectangular section carved out to accommodate it). The ceiling is vaulted, and is decorated with splendid pictures of the goddess Nut. The side walls show scenes from the &quot;Book of Caverns&quot; and the &quot;Book of the Earth.&quot; 

The far wall depicts Ramesses on his barque, surrounded by a host of gods. The yellows, dark blues, and blacks used to decorate this chamber are visually striking and unusual among the tomb decorations in the Valley. While the sarcophagus itself has long since vanished, Ramesses IX&#x27;s mummy was one of those found in the Deir el-Bahri cache (DB320) in 1881.

KV6 has been open since antiquity, as can be seen by the graffiti left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors.

<text>Chiromyiformes is an infraorder of strepsirrhine primates that includes the aye-aye from Madagascar and its extinct relatives.

==Classification==

The aye-aye is sometimes classified as a member of Lemuriformes, but others treat Chiromyiformes as a separate infraorder, based on their very reduced dental formula. Gunnell et al. (2018) reclassified the putative bat &quot;Propotto&quot; as a close relative of the aye-aye, as well as assigning the problematic strepsirrhine primate &quot;Plesiopithecus&quot; to Chiromyiformes.

==Evolution==
The molecular clock puts the divergence of Chiromyiformes and Lemuriformes at 50-49 million years ago.

<doc id="694434" wikidata="Q7855863" url="?curid=694434" title="Turner's Arena">
<text>Turner&#x27;s Arena was the name given to a 1,800 seat arena, located at 1341 W Street, near the northeast corner of 14th and W Streets, NW in Washington, DC, and originally owned by local wrestling promoter Joe Turner. One of the popular events were bouts featuring local wrestler Swift Eagle and Chief Thunderbird as detailed in the House History Man blog. A photograph and advertisement for the arena appears on page 69 of the book Greater U Street by Paul K. Williams. This venue was an early home to the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, a precursor to WWE, which was started by Vincent J. McMahon in January 1953. McMahon took over the territory from Gabe Menendez, who had succeeded Turner after his death in 1947. In addition, the arena hosted top professional boxing matches promoted by Goldie Ahearn featuring fighters such as Lou Gevinson, Lew Hanbury, and Jimmy Cooper. It was also the birthplace of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association annual basketball tournament, as well as the host to top country music acts and Jazz performances. It was renamed Capitol Arena in 1956 once Capitol Wrestling Corporation began broadcasting a syndicated weekly wrestling show from the arena every Thursday night. The arena was closed and demolished in 1965.

<text>The Stock Exchange (in German: Die Börse) is an 1896 book written by Max Weber, a German economist and sociologist.

During the 1890s the stock exchange had become the symbol of capitalism in Germany. During 1894–1896 Weber wrote a number of essays about stock exchange, in which he argued against the popular view that the stock exchange was a fraudulent enterprise designed to abuse &quot;the honest working people.&quot;

Weber in his research on the stock exchange concentrated on two subjects. First, he showed that commercialization could help create or destroy cultural values, sometimes doing both at the same time - it had destroyed the values of patriarchalism, but created the opportunities for farm workers. The stock exchange itself has facilitated the expansion of trade, but at the same time it did allow for new ways of crime and abuse. Second, Weber showed that economic conduct was an integral part of ideas related to pursuing economic interests, but those ideas have to be viewed separately.

<doc id="694440" wikidata="Q3943074" url="?curid=694440" title="Ryan McNeil">
<text>Ryan McNeil is a fictional character from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, an American soap opera on the CBS network. Created by William J. Bell, the character was portrayed by Scott Reeves, who made his first appearance on June 26, 1991, as a businessman who wanted to &quot;work his way to the top of the corporation ladder&quot;. The character gained popularity upon his relationship with Victoria Newman (Heather Tom), which initially received criticism due to the characters&#x27; age gap. He was also involved with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast) and the insane Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet).

Reeves, who described Ryan as a &quot;go-getter&quot; who was &quot;shrewd&quot; and a &quot;charmer&quot;, found his seduction storyline with Victoria hard to &quot;play out&quot;, considering her age. In October 2001, the actor announced his exit from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, stating that it was to pursue other projects. The producers kept quiet about the storyline surrounding his exit, although confirmed that he would depart &quot;in a big way&quot;. Within the story, Ryan prepared to remarry Victoria but Tricia Dennison, his ex-wife, attempted to shoot her and Ryan took two bullets and died from the injury. Throughout his time on the soap opera, Reeves became popular with fans as one of the genre&#x27;s leading men, garnering multiple awards and nominations.

==Casting==
Reeves first appeared as Ryan in May 1991, on contract. In March 2000, it was announced Reeves had signed a three-year deal with Sony Pictures, which would have furthered his portrayal until 2003. However, by August 2001, reports began to surface that Reeves had been released from his contract and would be exiting in a &quot;storyline-dictated&quot; departure, during the November sweeps period. In October, Reeves officially announced his exit from the soap opera, stating that it was to pursue other projects. The producers kept quiet about his exit storyline, but stated that he would leave &quot;in a big way&quot;. His character died on the episode dated November 27, 2001.

==Character development==

Upon Ryan&#x27;s introduction to the series, arch-villain David Kimble was on his way out, leaving the manipulative character of Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) &quot;mellowing&quot;. This is why Reeves was brought in, to fill the void, and portray a character which he best described as &quot;s&quot;. A businessman, Ryan wanted to work his way to the top of the corporation ladder. While Reeves is a family man, &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; characterized Ryan as &quot;rake&quot; and a &quot;soap seducer&quot;. While he was still a newcomer on the series, Reeves stated he was having a &quot;great time&quot; playing the role. He described Ryan as a &quot;go-getter&quot; who was &quot;very shrewd—and a real charmer&quot;. &quot;He gets what he wants&quot;, the actor explained to the &quot;Daily News of Los Angeles&quot;.

Months into the character&#x27;s duration on the series, he manipulatively seduced businessman Victor Newman&#x27;s (Eric Braeden) teenage daughter Victoria (Heather Tom). Reeves found it challenging to play out this storyline. He stated, &quot;You have to make up something, a situation in your mind, and play off that. I try to remember people I&#x27;ve known, or stories that I&#x27;ve heard about people who&#x27;ve been like [Ryan]&quot;. Eventually, Ryan and Victoria were married. Their marriage ended after Victoria refused to consummate it due to her fear of sex, resulting in Ryan beginning an affair with Nina Webster (Tricia Cast). The series&#x27; creator William J. Bell said that Victoria knew Nina still loved Ryan and suspected that the marriage would not last, and that &quot;in Victoria&#x27;s mind, the threat is still there&quot;. Of Victoria&#x27;s refusal to consummate her marriage, yet desperateness to get her husband back, the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; said: &quot;She&#x27;s divorced, rich and hates sex. And now she wants her husband back. As soap operas go, Victoria Newman&#x27;s plight [...] is standard daytime fare. But Victoria has one characteristic that many of her counterparts don&#x27;t – she is only 17&quot;.

==Storylines==
While working in the mail room at Newman Enterprises, 19-year-old Ryan meets 15-year-old Victoria Newman (Heather Tom), the daughter of the company&#x27;s founder and CEO, Victor Newman. The two fall in love and marry, to Victor&#x27;s dismay; however, Victoria refuses to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheats on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorces him, and he then moves in with Nina and her son, Phillip Chancellor IV (Thomas Dekker), and he later marries Nina out of obligation. He eventually develops genuine feelings for Nina; however, she has fallen in love with novelist Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck). After Cole rejects Nina, she has a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet). Nina then tries to commit suicide and shoots herself in a struggle with Ryan; he is arrested for the shooting. Nina suffers short-term amnesia, and although she regains her memory and exonerates Ryan, they divorce. Ryan then ends up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia is very jealous of Ryan&#x27;s relationship with Phillip, who accuses her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stops taking her birth control pills and they conceive a child; Ryan is against the idea, though he warms up to it. When she eventually miscarries, Tricia sees it as her punishment for having deceived her husband.

Tricia then becomes obsessed with destroying her sister Megan Dennison&#x27;s (Ashley Jones) relationship with Tony Viscardi (Nick Scotti). She runs Tony down in Megan&#x27;s driveway, and is suspected of having done so intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons leave town, including Tricia, who leaves Ryan to move to London, England. Six months later, Tricia returns to Genoa City and asks Ryan to take her back; he refuses, as Victoria has become interested in him again. Tricia turns to Carter Mills, who is really rapist Matt Clark (Rick Hearst). He uses her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide, but Ryan is able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunite, Victor has Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decide to remarry, and on their wedding day Tricia arrives in a wedding dress identical to Victoria&#x27;s, locks her in a closet and takes her place at the altar, where she holds Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her instead. Victor breaks Victoria free, who enters the chapel; Tricia shoots twice at her, but Ryan jumps in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan dies from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone. Shortly after, Ryan appears to Victoria in a dream where they say their vows, and she awakes with a ring on her finger.

==Reception==
A syndicated article that appeared in &quot;The Fort Oglethorpe Press&quot; described Ryan&#x27;s attempts to seduce Victoria as &quot;a path that&#x27;s fraught with peril and which forces the good-natured actor to search hard for inspiration&quot;. Over his duration on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, Reeves became popular with fans, and his performance was met with acclaim from his peers. In 1994, he garnered a Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. In 1997 and 1998, he earned Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor. The following year, he received a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Upon learning of the actor&#x27;s decision to quit following ten years on the soap opera, the &quot;Herald Journal&quot; said it was &quot;hard to believe&quot; that one of &quot;daytime&#x27;s most popular young leading men are leaving the fold&quot;. Fans of Reeves hoped that the show&#x27;s writers would play &quot;the ghost card&quot; for him to return to the series.

<doc id="694443" wikidata="Q7705434" url="?curid=694443" title="Tesco Ireland">
<text>Tesco Ireland Limited is the Irish subsidiary of supermarket group Tesco. Tesco Ireland was formed by Tesco plc&#x27;s 1997 purchase of the Irish retailing operations of Associated British Foods, namely Powers&#x27; Supermarkets Limited and its subsidiaries, trading as &quot;Quinnsworth&quot; and &quot;Crazy Prices&quot;. There are 152 Tesco stores in operation in Ireland as of August 2018. Tesco had approximately 21% of the Irish grocery market in 2021 and its main competitors are Dunnes Stores and SuperValu.

Tesco operates full-sized supermarkets under the main Tesco brand, smaller urban stores under the Tesco Metro banner, hypermarkets as Tesco Extra, a small number of convenience stores as Tesco Express, as well as internet shopping service Tesco.ie. It previously operated several petrol stations, which were divested in August 2019 to DCC plc. In 2007, the company launched its mobile telephone service, Tesco Mobile. Tesco Ireland operated a number of 24-hour stores, but has abandoned 24-hour opening as of 2014, with all stores closed from 00:00-06:00.

==History==

===Quinnsworth era===
The company was founded as &quot;Quinnsworth&quot; by Pat Quinn in 1966, and was later sold to Power Supermarkets. During the 1970s the slogan used was &quot;Let&#x27;s get it all together at Quinnsworth&quot;. Power Supermarkets Ltd. became the parent company but used Quinnsworth as its marketing name. The company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Associated British Foods plc.

Quinnsworth is remembered for its choice of store sites, its most memorable act was the addition of the phrase Yellow Pack to the retailing lexicon. Towards the end of Quinnsworth&#x27;s life, Yellow Pack was replaced by K.V.I. label as the low-cost generic grocery brand, and a high quality generic line called Premium Choice modeled after Loblaws President&#x27;s Choice (Loblaws being owned by another branch of the Weston family). Quinnsworth was also remembered for its advertising campaigns featuring its marketing director (and later chief executive) Maurice Pratt, who would personally introduce new product promotions, ending each advert with the company slogan, &quot;That&#x27;s Real Value&quot;.

Crazy Prices (occasionally Super Crazy Prices) was a brand used by Quinnsworth on some of its larger outlets. These were known for their cheap prices. Crazy Prices was one of the first retailers in Ireland to introduce late night opening (until 9pm) on Wednesdays, dubbing this night &quot;Crazy Night&quot; and running special in-store promotions. Until the mid-1990s, most Irish retailers only opened late one night a week, usually Thursday (in Dublin city) or Friday. KVI branding was Crazy Prices equivalent to the Quinnsworth Yellow pack. It came in blue red and white striped packaging. K.V.I. stood for &quot;Keen Value Item&quot; and was the equivalent of the previous Quinnsworth Yellow Pack, except perhaps even further downmarket.

===Tesco era===
On 6 May 1997, Tesco acquired the retailing and supply chain operations of Associated British Foods - with the sole exception of Primark - for £643 million.

The grocery businesses acquired were those held by Comar Limited in the Republic of Ireland and Stewarts Supermarkets Limited in Northern Ireland. Comar was the parent company of Powers Supermarkets Ltd (trading as Quinnsworth) and Crazy Prices in the Republic of Ireland. Stewarts Supermarkets included Crazy Prices in Northern Ireland.

Other businesses acquired were the Stewarts Wine Barrel off-licence chain, the sports goods retailer Lifestyle Sports, the meat processing and packing business Kingsway Fresh Foods Ltd. and the Fresh fruit and vegetable distributor Daily Wrap Produce Ltd.

The Northern Ireland operations were folded into Tesco&#x27;s core UK business, while the Republic of Ireland operations became Tesco Ireland. Lifestyle Sports was demerged in 1997 via a management buy-out of seven directors and the venture capital company, ACT. Stewarts Wine Barrel was sold to United Wine Merchants.
After the acquisition of Power Supermarkets (PSL) by Tesco, the company name changed to &quot;Tesco Ireland Limited&quot;. The first signs of the new regime was the almost immediate introduction of the Tesco own-brand (with advertising stating &quot;Tesco at Quinnsworth and Crazy Prices&quot;), with the completion of the phasing out of Yellow Pack and the other PSL own-brands such as KVI and Premium Choice. Maurice Pratt stayed on as chief executive of the Irish operations.

Over the next few years, the Quinnsworth and Crazy Prices chains were rebranded as Tesco Ireland, using a white-on-blue variation of the familiar Tesco logo. The first store to open under the Tesco name was in Athlone in 1997. The changeover was at first relatively slow, with the Quinnsworth and Crazy Prices names continuing to appear on adverts for some time after the launch of the new company identity. Tesco&#x27;s initial policy was not to change the name over the door until the store had been upgraded to Tesco&#x27;s standards, in some older stores this meant a significant rebuild of the premises. The first fully rebuilt store opened in Maynooth in 2000, which has since been redeveloped again as a Tesco Extra. Some older stores continued to trade under the Quinnsworth and Crazy Prices name until the early 2000s.

In 2001, Maurice Pratt, who had been the public face of Quinnsworth, left the company to become chief executive of C&amp;C, later taking up a post as chairman of Bank of Scotland (Ireland). He was replaced by Gordon Fryett.
 In the late 2000s, Tesco Ireland gradually rebranded as simply &quot;Tesco&quot;, using the regular red-on-white Tesco logo.

The company opened its first Irish &quot;Tesco Extra&quot; hypermarket at the Clare Hall Shopping Centre in Coolock, north Dublin in 2004, and has also branched into filling stations. Many stores are now also open 24 hours. The company has also moved into the convenience store market, with the first a converted Quinnsworth (then the smallest store in the chain) in Drumcondra, opened as a &quot;Tesco Local&quot;. This was the only store to use this brand in Ireland, with one store in Northern Ireland using the name as well, as subsequent new convenience stores use the &quot;Tesco Express&quot; brand instead.

Tesco has also expanded its product range in Ireland. The Tesco Extra hypermarkets, as well as larger Tesco stores, now stock a range of clothing, electrical goods, music, DVDs and video games, as well as newspapers, magazines, and toys.
The Naas, County Kildare store is the first in Ireland to have a Tesco Pharmacy.

On 30 November 2021, it was announced that Tesco Ireland had acquired the rival &quot;Joyce&#x27;s&quot; supermarket chain. In 2022, the business began rebranding the former Joyce&#x27;s shops. Tesco was required to sell Joyce&#x27;s Oranmore supermarket in order to obtain the approval of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission&#x27;s, due to there already being a Tesco supermarket in the town.

==Tesco.ie==
In October 2000, Tesco Ireland launched its Tesco.ie online shopping service for the Dublin area. The service expanded and by the end of the decade it was available nationwide.

==Criticisms==

=== Operations ===
Tesco Ireland has come in for increased criticism for apparently high prices in its Irish stores. However, there have been general criticisms of the similar pricing between Irish supermarkets, and economic reports noting the high prices in Ireland generally. Research from Forfas, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. Despite claims from Tesco that it matched prices in the Republic of Ireland with prices in Northern Ireland, a November 2009 survey by &quot;Consumers Choice&quot; magazine has claimed that, on average, prices are still 18% more expensive in the Republic In June 2012, Eurostat blamed &quot;overly dominant supermarkets&quot; as a factor why Ireland is the fifth most expensive nation in the EU in terms of supermarket prices. Tesco increased the prices of some well-known products significantly just weeks into 2011 before reducing them as part of a 1,000-product price promotion launched in March 2011.

Tesco Ireland was one of seven shops fined for failing to display prices properly by the National Consumer Agency in July 2008.

Tesco Ireland decided in 2019 not to make home deliveries in Tallaght due to a anti-social behaviour incidents in the area. 

Tesco apologised for selling anti-Jewish literature to customers in Ireland. Sheikh Dr Shaheed Satardien, head of the Muslim Council of Ireland, said this was effectively &quot;polluting the minds of impressionable young [Islamic] people with hate and anger towards the Jewish community&quot;.

The supermarket refused in 2002 to stock any of the million postcards which were aimed at closing the controversial nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, in England. Competing retailers did sell the postcards.

Tesco tried to hide its policy of buying directly from UK suppliers. An internal document said that ensuring its policy of taking deliveries directly from UK suppliers went unnoticed and &quot;invisible to the Irish customer&quot; was a key objective. At the same time the Irish Farmers&#x27; Association president said there was deep anger about Tesco&#x27;s decision to displace local produce with imports &quot;will inevitably lead to thousands of job losses and will put Irish producers of local, fresh produce out of business,&quot;

In 2008 The Irish Independent reported that roles in Tesco Ireland&#x27;s head office in Dún Laoghaire were being redeployed to the UK and outsourced to India. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; commented in April 2011 that &quot;Increasingly, Ireland is being viewed as a provincial backwater by the parent company – albeit a very profitable little backwater – and all the strategic decisions are being taken in the UK.

Tesco used the slogan &quot;Change for Good&quot; as advertising, which is trademarked by Unicef for charity usage but is not trademarked for commercial or retail use which prompted the agency to say &quot;it is the first time in Unicef&#x27;s history that a commercial entity has purposely set out to capitalise on one of our campaigns and subsequently damage an income stream which several of our programmes for children are dependent on&quot;. They went on to call on the public &quot;who have children’s welfare at heart, to consider carefully who they support when making consumer choices&quot;.

Large supermarket chains were accused by Fine Gael of putting up to 100,000 Irish jobs at risk by forcing suppliers to pay €160 million a year in &quot;hello money&quot;. The company was the subject of claims in February 2010 of demanding up to €500,000 per supplier for stocking goods. The leader of the Labour Party described the practice as &quot;outrageous extortion&quot; and was &quot;like the kind of thing you expect to see in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.&quot;

In early 2011, Tesco warned Irish publishers that it would ban their books from its shelves if they did not comply with its rules. A bestseller, which sparked the controversy over the revelation about Sean FitzPatrick&#x27;s golf meeting with Taoiseach Brian Cowen, was published in secret and distributed directly to Easons and selected bookstores—but not to Tesco or other supermarkets. The secret last-minute delivery was organised to avoid any legal complications that might have prevented publication. Tesco said &quot;if we find evidence of this happening (again), the offending publisher will have all their titles removed from sale and returned&quot;. One publisher pointed out that Tesco sometimes implements exclusive deals itself.

Tesco was convicted of a breach of consumer law for not displaying the right price of goods in October 2011.

In January 2012, a former Tesco employee was awarded damages at the Employment Appeals Tribunal where he claimed there was a link between his dismissal and his HIV status. Tesco stated that he was dismissed for gross misconduct, i.e. consuming a product without paying for it.

In February 2013, it was reported that staff at a Tesco warehouse were made to wear digital arm-band devices that monitor their performance.

Tesco was branded &quot;hypocritical&quot; by Irish poultry farmers for its commitment to source all UK-sold fresh poultry from the UK, but not doing the same in Ireland. This is putting pressure on prices in Ireland as surplus poultry meat from the UK is being dumped on the market.

=== Marketing and advertising ===
The Irish Advertising Standards Authority in January 2009 found that Tesco Ireland advertising was misleading.

Britain&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority said a leaflet produced by Tesco Ireland Ltd, was ‘‘irresponsible’’ and breached clauses in the advertising code on substantiation and weight control in May 2010.

Tesco pleaded guilty and was fined, after sending unsolicited marketing emails to a number of customers and for having a problem with the email &quot;opt-out&quot; option.

=== Food safety ===
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, has on a number of occasions ordered the recall of Tesco branded products, including a case of glass contamination. Environmental Health Officers served a closure order on Tesco&#x27;s store in Prussia Street, Dublin, the day after they inspected it, for a number of breaches of Food Hygiene Regulations. Most food is imported from Britain, where the BBC&#x27;s Whistleblower programme showed undercover footage showing the sale of products after their sell-by date; allegations that the company illegally sold &#x27;back-labelled&#x27; products after their use by date; falsification of temperature records; and the sale of partially cooked mince mixed with uncooked mince.

In May 2012, it pleaded guilty to selling &quot;&quot; (decayed or rotten) meat and the next month was prosecuted and fined for breaches of consumer law.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland found horse meat, consumption of which is considered taboo in Ireland, accounted for approximately 29% of the meat content in beef burger products from Tesco in January 2013.

==Financial performance==
Tesco&#x27;s Irish profit margin was 9.3 per cent in 2008, making the Irish operation Tesco&#x27;s most successful worldwide in margin terms.

==Tesco Mobile==
On 26 October 2007, Tesco Ireland announced that &#x27;An extensive range of Tesco Mobile prepay handsets will be rolled out to 48 Tesco stores from Monday 29 October&#x27;. Tesco Mobile launched as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO), piggybacking on the O2 Network in Ireland. It had also outsourced the running of Tesco Mobile to Fujitsu Ireland. The network uses the 089 prefix.

Up to March 2015, Tesco Mobile Ireland operated as an MVNO on the O2 Ireland network. O2 Ireland has since been purchased and merged with Three Ireland and as a result, Tesco Mobile now operates as an MVNO on the Three Ireland Network with 99.6% coverage.

<doc id="694449" wikidata="Q1470954" url="?curid=694449" title="The Hughleys">
<text>The Hughleys is an American television sitcom that aired on ABC from September 22, 1998 to April 28, 2000 and on UPN from September 11, 2000 to May 20, 2002. It was co-created by comedian D.L. Hughley and Matt Wickline and starred comedian Hughley as the main character, Darryl Hughley, and Elise Neal as Yvonne, his hard-working wife, who move their family from the inner city to suburban Los Angeles.

==Plot summary==
The show starred D. L. Hughley as the main character, vending machine salesman Darryl Hughley. Elise Neal portrayed Darryl&#x27;s wife Yvonne. Former &quot;Living Single&quot; co-star John Henton portrayed the couple&#x27;s best friend Milsap Morris from the &quot;old neighborhood&quot;, who often visited the family and helped them out (much resemblance to Willona visiting James and Florida on &quot;Good Times&quot;). Ashley Monique Clark portrayed Darryl and Yvonne&#x27;s 12-year-old daughter Sydney, and Dee Jay Daniels portrayed their 10-year-old son Michael; both children sometimes acted out and sometimes caused complete chaos. Michael&#x27;s best friends included Ronnie (Preston Wamsley), Otto (played by Connor Matheus in Seasons 1 and 2, then Ian Meltzer in Seasons 3 and 4), and Miles (Martin Spanjers).

The show&#x27;s initial plot involved successful vending-machine business owner Darryl Hughley moving his family from a South Los Angeles ghetto to West Hills, a predominantly white neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley and move on up wealthy neighborhood. Darryl and his family try to adjust to living in an all-white area while trying not to forget who they are and where they came from. Darryl and Yvonne befriend their new neighbors, Sally and Dave, who are Darryl&#x27;s polar opposites. The story has many racial themes that are usually comedic as Darryl makes fun of other races, especially his white and Korean neighbors.

==Cast and characters==
Marietta DePrima and Eric Allan Kramer played Dave and Sally Rogers, a friendly, wholesome suburban white couple. Marla Gibbs played Darryl&#x27;s happy-go-lucky mother Hattie Mae opposite Ellis Williams as his father Henry. Telma Hopkins portrayed Yvonne&#x27;s mother, Paulette Williams, and Sherman Hemsley portrayed Yvonne&#x27;s father, James Williams, who thought of Darryl as a &quot;jackass&quot;. Patricia Belcher appeared as Aunt Jessie Mae Hughley, and Adele Givens portrayed Yvonne&#x27;s older sister Shari Williams, Darryl&#x27;s wisecracking, backtalking, evil sister-in-law.

The show spent two seasons on ABC. In its first season, it followed &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, but was canceled when ABC decided to revamp its TGIF lineup. UPN picked up the show in the fall of 2000 and it aired in the Monday night lineup along &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;The Parkers&quot; and &quot;Girlfriends&quot;. While &quot;The Parkers&quot; and &quot;Girlfriends&quot; had improved ratings, &quot;The Hughleys&quot; aired its series finale after its fourth season.

The series had many guest stars including Ashley Tisdale, Billy Dee Williams, as Darryl&#x27;s biological father, Kelly Rowland, Lil&#x27; Romeo, Gary Coleman, Pat Morita, Vivica A. Fox, Mo&#x27;Nique, Tyra Banks, and Rose Marie.

===Main characters===
* Darryl Hughley (D. L. Hughley): a thirty-five-year-old successful salesman and business owner. His wife is Yvonne, and they have two children, Sydney and Michael. He moved from his old black neighborhood into a white suburban neighborhood. He is the son of Henry and Hattie Mae Hughley. Upon the show&#x27;s move from ABC to UPN, the character was featured in a crossover appearance on the UPN series &quot;The Parkers&quot; in the Season 2 episode &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Mama?&quot;. He is best friends with Milsap (his sales manager), and later his white neighbour Dave Rogers.
* Yvonne Williams-Hughley (Elise Neal): Darryl&#x27;s wife, the mother of their two children, and best friend of Sally. She does not get along with Darryl&#x27;s mother Hattie, who constantly criticizes everything she does. Darryl calls her &quot;Vonnie&quot;, as does Milsap sometimes.
* Sydney (Ashley Monique Clark) and Michael Hughley (Dee Jay Daniels): Darryl and Yvonne&#x27;s 12-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son.
* Dave (Eric Allan Kramer) and Sally Rogers (Marietta DePrima): the Hughley family&#x27;s Caucasian neighbors and best friends. They often hang out and travel together. Initially, Darryl was unwilling to befriend them out of fear that they were racists. Dave can be described as a &quot;jolly giant&quot;. He owns a sporting goods store, and is very knowledgeable about sports, vehicles, and extreme activities. Sally and Darryl have a sort of brother/sister-like friendship, as sometimes he&#x27;ll turn to her for advice or jokingly tease her. Dave and Sally have two children: son Otto and daughter Gretchen. Sydney and Michael often address Dave and Sally as &quot;Uncle Dave&quot; and &quot;Aunt Sally&quot;.
*Milsap Morris (John Henton), Darryl&#x27;s lifelong best friend, the sales manager of his company. He frequently visits the Hughley household, and provides much comic relief throughout the series. Unlike Darryl, Milsap is unmarried with no children which sometimes saddens him. Early in the series, Dave becomes Milsap&#x27;s second-best friend after the two form a strong friendship - which Darryl was jealous of at first until he learned to be friends with both men. Darryl, Yvonne, and Dave often refer to him by his nickname &quot;Sap&quot;, whereas Sydney and Michael address him as &quot;Uncle Sap&quot; or &quot;Uncle Milsap&quot;.

===Recurring characters===
* Hattie Mae Hughley (Marla Gibbs), Darryl&#x27;s somewhat aggressive mother, who made her first appearance in &quot;The Thanksgiving Episode&quot;. She criticizes Yvonne, from her cooking habits to everything else she finds wrong with her. She also appears to have a firm handle on Darryl as the no-nonsense mother who refuses to let him get away with anything, despite his adulthood. This is shown in many episodes, one example being Sydney and Michael failing to &quot;punish&quot; Daryl for drugs from his past, in which they get their grandmother to do it instead. She made her last appearance on &quot;How Hattie Got Her Groove Back&quot;.
* Henry Hughley (Ellis Williams), Darryl&#x27;s &quot;father&quot;, who made his first appearance in &quot;The Thanksgiving Episode&quot;. In the 2nd-season episode, Darryl discovers that Henry isn&#x27;t his biological father; but still Darryl sees him as more of a father for raising him. He made his last appearance in &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot;.
* Jessie Mae (Patricia Belcher), Darryl&#x27;s maternal aunt. She made her first appearance in &quot;The Thanksgiving Episode&quot;, where the Hughley women attempt to Thanksgiving cooking. In a few other appearances, she is shown more confrontational than Hattie Mae, but still may have her moments.
* Hazel/M&#x27;Dear (Virginia Capers), Darryl&#x27;s maternal grandmother. She makes her first appearance in &quot;The Thanksgiving Episode&quot;, where the Hughley women attempt to take over Thanksgiving cooking. She appears to be less insulting than Hattie Mae.
* Chuck Ballard (Taylor Negron), Darryl&#x27;s neighbor and the kids&#x27; music teacher. He often appears in antagonistic roles, such as the episode &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, where he faked a dog attack in spite of Darryl demanding him to take out his lewd lawn decorations.
* JoJo (Miguel A. Núñez Jr.), Darryl&#x27;s older brother, who worked at an airport.
* James Williams (Sherman Hemsley), Yvonne&#x27;s father who still doesn&#x27;t approve of Darryl; the two never get along with each other.
* Paulette Williams (Telma Hopkins), Yvonne&#x27;s mother, who is less confrontational with Darryl.
* Shari Williams (Adele Givens), Yvonne&#x27;s older sister. Like her father, she doesn&#x27;t get along with Darryl.

==Episodes==

===Series finale===
&quot;The Hughleys&quot; ended with a two-part series finale entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Girl!&quot; (aired on May 13 and May 20, 2002). In this episode, Darryl Hughley&#x27;s niece, Carly (guest star Kelly Rowland) is preparing for college (the college was unknown), with peace, tranquility and no expectation of her relatives coming to annoy her (implying the entire Hughleys clan). Carly then receives an unexpected visit from her cousins Sydney and Michael. Darryl and Milsap go to their twentieth high school reunion and Milsap learns that his &quot;old&quot; girlfriend, Shandra, has a child, and he is the father.

<text>Rebecca Renee Olstead (born June 18, 1989) is an American actress, singer, and marriage and family therapist. Active since childhood as an actress, she is best known for her roles on the CBS sitcom &quot;Still Standing&quot; and on the ABC Family drama &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; as Madison Cooperstein. In addition, she has recorded four studio albums, primarily of jazz music.

==Early life==
Olstead was born in Kingwood, Texas, to Christopher Eric Olstead and Rebecca Lynn Jeffries. Olstead is of Norwegian ancestry. She also attended Centre Stage theatrical school and is mentioned on their website&#x27;s list of alumni.

== Career ==
As a child actress, she made films and commercials from age eight onwards. From 2002 to 2006, she appeared in the TV sitcom &quot;Still Standing&quot; as middle sister Lauren Miller. Olstead was presented with the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy) - Supporting Young Actress for &quot;Still Standing&quot; in 2002. She also had a small part in the 2004 film &quot;13 Going on 30&quot;. She co-starred in the ABC Family series &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot;, about fifteen-year-old Amy Juergens&#x27;s struggle through her unexpected pregnancy and how it affected her peers. Olstead played the character Madison Cooperstein, one of Amy&#x27;s best friends.

In 2004, Olstead released a self-titled album of jazz songs and pop standards for Warner Bros. Records to good reviews. Since her previous releases had limited distribution, this album was considered her official debut. She subsequently performed in Berlin during the Live 8 concert on July 2, 2005.

Olstead also recorded with trumpeter Chris Botti on his 2005 album &quot;To Love Again: The Duets&quot; and appeared on the 2006 DVD &quot;Chris Botti Live with Orchestra and Special Guests&quot;. Her singing style is influenced by such great jazz vocalists as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. Reportedly, her musical talent was discovered by composer David Foster, who produced her 2004 album. She later performed with him on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

A follow-up album entitled Skylark, also produced by Foster, was originally announced for release in 2005, but it was subsequently pushed back several times, with release dates in the summer of 2006 and early 2007 being mentioned on online retailers such as Amazon.com. It was then scheduled for a June 2008 release, but was delayed once again. It was finally released on January 27, 2009, nearly four years after it was originally announced.

Olstead most recently starred as Kaitlan in the 2013 supernatural thriller &quot;The Midnight Game&quot; and as Jess Felton in the 2014 technology-themed thriller film &quot;Unfriended&quot;.

On November 30, 2020, Renee announced that she was launching an OnlyFans page. Her introductory subscription fee was set at $9.99 per month. She was the &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Month in January 2023 and the 2024 &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Year. Since April 12, 2023 she is an associate marriage and family therapist specializing in sex therapy. She is a sex therapist for the adult industry mental health support network Pineapple Support.

==Personal life==
Renee was married to pianist Tommy King, and legally took his last name. The two divorced in 2020. As Renee King, she was crowned Ms. West Coast at the Miss West Coast pageant in 2016.

Olstead is a vegan. She appeared in a PETA ad, &quot;Fish Are Friends Not Food&quot;, urging her fans to become vegan themselves.

On September 14, 2011, as the result of a criminal complaint initially made by actress Scarlett Johansson, the FBI announced it was investigating the alleged hacking of celebrity cellphone and email accounts and the dissemination of explicit nude photographs of Johansson and approximately 50 other celebrities, including Olstead. As a result of the investigation, 35-year-old Christopher Chaney of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested in October 2011. During the trial, Olstead testified that she attempted suicide after the nude photographs were leaked, adding that she had never before considered suicide before the hacking. Chaney was sentenced to 10 years in prison in December 2012.

<doc id="694468" wikidata="Q2327358" url="?curid=694468" title="Wilma Mankiller">
<text>Wilma Pearl Mankiller (; November 18, 1945April 6, 2010) was a Native American activist, social worker, community developer and the first woman elected to serve as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Born in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, she lived on her family&#x27;s allotment in Adair County, Oklahoma, until the age of 11, when her family relocated to San Francisco as part of a federal government program to urbanize Indigenous Americans. After high school, she married a well-to-do Ecuadorian and raised two daughters. Inspired by the social and political movements of the 1960s, Mankiller became involved in the Occupation of Alcatraz and later participated in the land and compensation struggles with the Pit River Tribe. For five years in the early 1970s, she was employed as a social worker, focusing mainly on children&#x27;s issues.

When Mankiller returned to Oklahoma in 1976, the Cherokee Nation hired her as an economic stimulus coordinator. With her expertise at preparing documentation, she became a successful grant writer, and by the early 1980s was directing the newly created Community Development Department of the Cherokee Nation. As Director she designed and supervised innovative community projects allowing rural citizens to identify their own challenges and, through their labor, participate in solving them. Her project in Bell, Oklahoma, was featured in the movie &quot;The Cherokee Word for Water&quot;, directed by Charlie Soap and Tim Kelly. In 2015, the movie was selected as the top American Indian film of the past 40 years by the American Indian Film Institute. Her project in Kenwood received the Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Certificate of National Merit.

Her management ability came to the notice of the incumbent Principal Chief, Ross Swimmer, who invited her to run as his deputy in the 1983 tribal elections. When the duo won, she became the first elected woman to serve as Deputy Chief of the Cherokee Nation. She was elevated to Principal Chief when Swimmer took a position in the federal administration of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, serving until 1995. During her administration, the Cherokee government built new health clinics, created a mobile eye-care clinic, established ambulance services, and created early education, adult education and job training programs. She developed revenue streams, including factories, retail stores, restaurants and bingo operations, while establishing self-governance, allowing the tribe to manage its own finances.

Mankiller returned to her activist role as an advocate working to improve the image of Native Americans and combat the misappropriation of native heritage, by authoring books including a bestselling autobiography, &quot;Mankiller: A Chief and Her People&quot;, and giving numerous lectures on health care, tribal sovereignty, women&#x27;s rights and cancer awareness after retiring from politics. Throughout her life, she had serious health problems, including polycystic kidney disease, myasthenia gravis, lymphoma and breast cancer, and needed two kidney transplants. She died in 2010 from pancreatic cancer, and was honored with many local, state and national awards, including the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In 2021 it was announced that Mankiller&#x27;s likeness would appear on the quarter-dollar coin as a part of the United States Mint&#x27;s &quot;American Women quarters&quot; program.

==Early life (1945–1955)==
Wilma Pearl Mankiller was born on November 18, 1945, in the Hastings Indian Hospital in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, to Clara Irene (née Sitton) and Charley Mankiller. Her father was a full-blooded Cherokee, whose ancestors had been forced to relocate to Indian Territory from Tennessee over the Trail of Tears in the 1830s. Her mother descended from Dutch-Irish and English immigrants who had first settled in Virginia and North Carolina in the 1700s. Her maternal grandparents came to Oklahoma in the early 1900s from Georgia and Arkansas, respectively. The surname &quot;Mankiller&quot;, &quot;Asgaya-dihi&quot; (Cherokee syllabary: ᎠᏍᎦᏯᏗᎯ) in the Cherokee language, refers to a traditional Cherokee military rank, similar to a captain or major, or a shaman with the ability to avenge wrongs through spiritual methods. Alternative spellings are Outacity and Ontassetè. Wilma&#x27;s given Cherokee name, meaning flower, was &quot;A-ji-luhsgi&quot;. When Charley and Irene married in 1937, they settled on Charley&#x27;s father, John Mankiller&#x27;s allotment, known as &quot;Mankiller Flats&quot;, near Rocky Mountain in Adair County, Oklahoma, which he had received in 1907 as part of the government policy of forced assimilation for Native American people. 
Wilma had five older siblings: Louis Donald &quot;Don&quot;, Frieda Marie, Robert Charles, Frances Kay and John David. In 1948, when she was three, the family moved into a house built by her father, her uncle and her brother, Don, on the allotment of her grandfather John. Her five other siblings, Linda Jean, Richard Colson, Vanessa Lou, James Ray and William Edward, were born over the next 12 years. The small house had no electricity or plumbing and they lived in &quot;extreme poverty&quot;. The family hunted and fished, maintaining a vegetable garden to feed themselves. They also grew peanuts and strawberries, which they sold. Mankiller went to school through the fifth grade in a three-room schoolhouse, in Rocky Mountain. The family spoke both English and Cherokee at home; even Mankiller&#x27;s mother spoke Cherokee. Her mother canned food and used flour sacks to make clothes for the children, whom she immersed in Cherokee heritage. Though they joined the Baptist church, the children were wary of white congregants and customs, preferring to attend tribal ceremonial gatherings. Family elders taught the children traditional stories.

==Relocation to San Francisco (1956–1976)==
In 1955, a severe drought made it more difficult for the family to provide for itself. As a part of the Indian termination policy, the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 provided assistance to relocate Native families to urban areas. Agents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs promised better jobs and living conditions for families that agreed to move. In 1956, when she was 11, her father Charley was denied a loan from the BIA, and decided that moving to a city where he would have a regular income and a steady job would be good for his family. The family chose California because Irene&#x27;s mother lived in Riverbank. Selling their belongings, they took a train from Stilwell, Oklahoma, to San Francisco. Though they were promised an apartment in the city, there were no apartments available when the Mankillers arrived. They were housed in a squalid hotel in the Tenderloin District for several weeks. Even when the family moved to Potrero Hill, where both her father and brother Don found work, the family struggled financially. They had few Native American neighbors, creating alienation from their tribal identities.
Mankiller and her siblings enrolled in school, but it was difficult as the other students made fun of her surname and teased her about her clothes and the way she spoke. Mankiller withdrew from school due to her classmates&#x27; treatment. Within a year, the family had saved money and were able to move to Daly City, but Mankiller still felt alienated and ran away from home, going to her grandmother&#x27;s farm in Riverbank. Wilma continued to run away despite her grandmother made her return to Potrero so her parents decided to let her live on the farm for a year. By the time she returned, the family had moved again and were living in Hunters Point, a neighborhood riddled with crime, drugs and gangs. Though she had regained her confidence during her year away, Mankiller still felt isolated and began to become involved in the activities of the San Francisco Indian Center. She remained indifferent to school, where she struggled with math and science, but graduated from high school in June 1963. 
As soon as she finished school, Mankiller found a clerical job in a finance company and moved in with her sister Frances. That summer, at a Latin dance, she met Hector Hugo Olaya de Bardi, an Ecuadorian college student from a well-to-do family, and the two began dating. Mankiller found him sophisticated, and despite her parents&#x27; discomfort with the union, the two married in Reno, Nevada, on November 13, 1963, and then honeymooned in Chicago. Returning to California, they moved into an apartment in the Mission District, where 10 months later their daughter Felicia was born. They then moved to a house in a nearby neighborhood and in 1966 had a second daughter, Gina. While Olaya continued with his schooling at San Francisco State University and worked for Pan American Airlines, Mankiller was busy raising their daughters. Olaya saw his role as the family&#x27;s provider, leaving his wife at home to bring up the children. But Mankiller was restless and returned to school, enrolling in classes at Skyline Junior College. For the first time, she enjoyed school and took only courses that interested her.

===Activism===
In 1964, a small group of Red Power activists occupied Alcatraz Island for a few hours. In the late 1960s, a group of students from the University of California at Berkeley, Los Angeles and Santa Cruz, along with students at San Francisco State, began protesting against the Vietnam War and in favor of civil rights for ethnic minorities and women. Among the groups that sprang up in the period was the American Indian Movement (AIM), which in San Francisco was centered around the activities at the San Francisco Indian Center. Also meeting there was the United Bay Indian Council, which operated as an umbrella organization for 30 separate groups representing people of different tribal affiliations. In October 1969, the Center burned, and the loss of their meeting place created a bond between administrators and student activists, who combined their efforts to bring the plight of urban Native Americans to the public eye with the reoccupation of Alcatraz. 
The occupation inspired Mankiller to become involved in civil rights activism. Prior to the November takeover of the island, she had not been involved in either AIM or the United Bay Council. She began to meet with other Native Americans who had participated in the Indian Center, becoming active in the groups supporting the Occupation. While she did visit Alcatraz, most of her work focused on fundraising and support, gathering supplies of blankets, food and water for those on the island. Soon after the Occupation began, Charley Mankiller was diagnosed with kidney disease, which caused Mankiller to discover that she shared polycystic kidney disease with her father. In between her activism, school and family obligations, she spent as much time with him as she was able. The Occupation lasted 19 months, and during that time, Mankiller learned organizational skills and how to do paralegal research. She had been encouraged by other activists to continue her studies, and began planning a career.

===Social work===
On her father&#x27;s death in 1971, the Mankiller family returned to Oklahoma for his burial. When she returned to California, she transferred to San Francisco State University in 1972 and began to focus her classes on social welfare. Against her husband&#x27;s wishes, she bought her own car and began to seek independence, taking her daughters to Native American events along the West Coast. On her travels, she met members of the Pit River Tribe in Northern California, near Burney, and joined their campaign for compensation with the Indian Claims Commission and Pacific Gas and Electric Company for lands illegally taken from the tribe during the California Gold Rush. Over the next five years, she assisted the tribe in raising funds for its legal defense and helped prepare documentation for their claim, gaining experience in international and treaty law. 
Closer to home, Mankiller founded East Oakland&#x27;s Native American Youth Center, where she served as director. Locating a building, she called for volunteers to paint and help draft educational programs to help youth learn about their heritage, enjoying overwhelming support from the community. In 1974, Mankiller and Olaya divorced and she moved with her two daughters to Oakland. Taking a position as a social worker with the Urban Indian Resource Center, she worked on programs conducting research on child abuse and neglect, foster care, and adoption of Native children. Recognizing that most indigenous children were placed with families with no knowledge of Native traditions, she worked on legislation with other staff and attorneys to prevent children from being removed from their culture. The law, which eventually passed as the Indian Child Welfare Act, made it illegal to place Native children in non-Native families.

==Return to Oklahoma==
===Community development (1976–1983)===
In 1976, Mankiller&#x27;s mother returned to Oklahoma, prompting Mankiller to move as well with her two daughters. Initially, she was unable to find work and moved back to California for six months. By the fall, she was back in Oklahoma, and built a small house near her mother&#x27;s in Mankiller Flats. After doing volunteer work for the Cherokee Nation, Mankiller was hired in 1977 to work on a program for young Cherokees to study environmental science. That same year she enrolled in additional classes at Flaming Rainbow University in Stilwell, Oklahoma, completing her Bachelor of Science degree in social sciences with an emphasis on Indian Affairs, thanks to a correspondence course under a program offered by the Union for Experimental Colleges in Washington, D.C. She enrolled in graduate courses in community development at the University of Arkansas, in Fayetteville, while continuing to work in the tribal offices as an economic stimulus coordinator. She worked on home health care, the Indian child welfare protocols, language services, a senior citizens program and a youth shelter. 
On November 9, 1979, on her way back to Tahlequah from Fayetteville, Mankiller&#x27;s vehicle was struck by an oncoming car. Sherry Morris, one of Mankiller&#x27;s closest friends, was driving the other vehicle and died in the crash. Mankiller suffered broken ribs as well as breaks in her left leg and ankle, and both her face and right leg were crushed. Initially doctors thought that she would not regain the ability to walk. After 17 operations and plastic surgery to reconstruct her face, she was released from the hospital able to walk with crutches. While still in recovery from the accident, three months after the collision, Mankiller began to notice a loss of muscle coordination. She dropped things, was unable to grip items, her voice tired after a few moments of speaking. Doctors thought that the problems were related to the accident, but one day while watching a muscular dystrophy telethon, Mankiller thought her symptoms sounded similar. She called the muscular dystrophy center, was referred to a specialist, and was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. In November 1980, she returned to the hospital, underwent more surgeries and began a course of chemotherapy, which lasted several years. She went back to work in December.

She later said the car crash and its aftermath were life-changing, leading her to accept what she called &quot;a Cherokee approach to life.&quot; In a 1993 interview on NPR, she said: &quot;I think the Cherokee approach to life is being able to continually move forward with kind of a good mind and not focus on the negative things in your life and the negative things you see around you, but focus on the positive things and try to look at the larger picture and keep moving forward..[It] also taught me to look at the larger things in life rather than focusing on small things, and it&#x27;s also awfully, awfully hard to rattle me after having faced my own mortality ... so the things I learned from those experiences actually enabled me to lead. Without those experiences, I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to lead. I think I would have gotten caught up in a lot of nonsensical things.&quot;
Mankiller&#x27;s first community development program as a grant writer was for Bell, Oklahoma. By requiring community members to donate their time and labor to lay 16 miles of pipe for a shared water system, build houses, or work on building rehabilitation, the grant involved the community in self-improvement. Working on the Bell project, Mankiller collaborated with Charlie Soap, who worked in the Indian Housing Authority and helped her supervise the venture. The success of the program led to its use as a model for other grant programs for her own and other tribes. In the midst of the Bell Project, in 1981, tribal chief Ross Swimmer promoted her as first director of a department she devised, the Community Development Department of the Cherokee Nation. Over the next three years, Mankiller raised millions of dollars for similar community development programs. Her approach was one of self-help, which allowed citizens to identify their problems and gain control of the challenges they faced. Impressed by her skill and results, Swimmer asked her to be his running mate for the next tribal election.

===Politics (1983–1995)===
====Deputy Chief (1983–1985)====
In 1983, Mankiller, a Democrat, was selected as a running mate by Ross Swimmer, a Republican, in a bid for Swimmer&#x27;s third consecutive term as principal chief. Though they both wanted the tribe to become more self-sufficient, Swimmer felt the path was through developing tribal businesses, like hotels and agricultural enterprises. Mankiller wanted to focus on small rural communities, improving housing and health care. Their differences on policy were not a key problem in the election, but Mankiller&#x27;s gender was. She was surprised by the sexism she faced, as in traditional Cherokee society, families and clans were organized matrilineally. Though traditionally women had not held titled positions in Cherokee government, they had a women&#x27;s council which wielded considerable influence, and were responsible for training the tribal chief. She received death threats, her tires were slashed, and a billboard with her likeness was burned. Swimmer nevertheless remained steadfast. Swimmer won reelection against Perry Wheeler by a narrow margin, on the strength of absentee voters. Mankiller also won by absentee voters in a run-off election for the deputy chief post against Agnes Cowen and became the first woman elected deputy chief of the Cherokee Nation. Wheeler and Cowen demanded a recount and filed a suit with the Cherokee Judicial Appeals Tribunal and U. S. District Court alleging voting irregularities. Both tribal and federal courts ruled against Wheeler and Cowen. 


One of her main duties as deputy chief was to preside over the Tribal Council, the fifteen-member governing body for the Cherokee Nation. Though she assumed that the sexism of the campaign would end once the election was resolved, Mankiller quickly realized that she had little support in the council. Some members viewed her as a political enemy, while others discounted her because of her gender. She chose to avoid involvement in tribal legislation to minimize the hostility to her election, instead concentrating on areas of government that the council did not control. One of her first focus issues was on the full-blood/mixed-blood divide. Cherokees with non-Native ancestry had assimilated into American culture to a greater extent, while full-bloods maintained Cherokee language and culture. The two groups historically had been at odds, with much disagreement on development. By the time Mankiller was elected deputy, the mixed-blood faction focused on economic growth and favored non-Natives being hired to run Native businesses if they were more qualified. Full-bloods believed that such modernization would compromise Cherokee identity. Mankiller, who supported a middle-of-the-road approach, expanded the Cherokee Heritage Center and the Institute for Cherokee Literacy. She persuaded the tribal council to change the way that council members were elected so that rather than at-large candidates, potential members came from newly created districts. The change meant that urban areas with large populations no longer controlled the council membership.

====Principal Chief, partial term (1985–1986)====
In 1985, Chief Swimmer resigned when appointed assistant secretary of the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. Mankiller succeeded him as the first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, when she was sworn into office on December 5, 1985. To appease her detractors on the council, she did not attend council meetings, and stressed the separation between the executive and legislative branches of the government. Almost immediately, the press coverage on Mankiller made her an international celebrity and improved the perception of Native Americans throughout the country. In articles such as a November 1985 interview in &quot;People&quot;, Mankiller strove to show that Native cultural traditions of cooperation and respect for the environment made them role models for the rest of society. In an interview with &quot;Ms.&quot;, she pointed out that Cherokee women had been valued members of their communities before mainstream society imposed patriarchy upon the tribe. In presenting her critiques of Reagan administration policies that might diminish tribal self-determination or threaten their culture, she built relationships with various power brokers. Because she lacked favor with the Tribal Council, she also used her access with the press to educate Cherokee voters on the goals of her administration and her desire to improve housing and health services. Within five months of becoming chief, Mankiller&#x27;s celebrity status resulted in her election that year as American Indian Woman of the Year, an honor bestowed by the Oklahoma Federation of Indian Women, and her induction into the Oklahoma Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of New England and received a citation for leadership from Harvard University. 
By 1986, Mankiller and Charlie Soap&#x27;s relationship had changed from a professional one to a personal one, leading to their engagement early in the year. Not wanting to provoke calls for her to step down, they kept the relationship private until their marriage in October. It nevertheless caused controversy, generating calls for Soap to resign from his position. He resigned, effective with the end of January 1987, which generated further criticism from Mankiller&#x27;s opponents, who saw the delay as a tactic for Soap to qualify for retirement benefits. Initially, Mankiller&#x27;s negative experiences dissuaded her from seeking re-election, but after her opponents tried to persuade her not to run, she entered the race with Soap&#x27;s support. She persuaded voters that the tribe could cooperate with state and federal governments to negotiate favorable terms to improve their opportunities. Soap, as a full-blood Cherokee, was instrumental in taking her message to that faction and defusing the gender issue, by speaking in Cherokee with them about the traditional place of women in Cherokee society. Focusing on budget cuts by the Reagan White House, she highlighted how reductions in funding for low-income housing, health and nutrition programs, and educational initiatives were affecting the tribe. While she recognized that economic development was a priority, Mankiller stressed that business development had to be balanced by addressing social problems. 
Weeks before the election, Mankiller was hospitalized for her kidney disease. Her opponents argued that she was medically unfit to lead the tribe. Turnout was high and even though Mankiller won 45% of the vote, tribal law required 50% to avoid a run-off with Perry Wheeler. She won the run-off, but within a week one of her supporters, who had been elected to the Tribal Council, died. The tribal election committee voted to nullify the absentee ballots for the new council membership, and Mankiller petitioned the Judicial Appeals Tribunal, which required a recount including the absentee voters. The council recount gave Mankiller&#x27;s administration the majority and the seat was filled by a supporter of her policies. Mankiller used the press surrounding her election to combat the negative stereotypes about Native people, stressing their cultural heritage and strengths. She was selected as Newsmaker of the Year by the Association for Women in Communications and as &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine&#x27;s Woman of the Year for 1987, and was featured in the article &quot;Celebration of Heroes&quot; in &quot;Newsweek&quot; July 1987 edition.

====Principal Chief, first elected term (1987–1991)====
One of Mankiller&#x27;s first initiatives was to lobby for maintaining the operation of the Talking Leaves Job Corps Center, which the U.S. Department of Labor had placed on a list for closure. Officials agreed to suspend the closure if she could find a suitable location. She recommended that the job center be housed in the financially insolvent motel, but initially the Tribal Council denied her permission. She was able to reverse their decision by promising to take the issue directly to a vote of the tribal members. She also expanded community development programs, using the Bell Project model, and in 1987 the Kenwood Project won the Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Certificate of National Merit. Announcing that the Cherokee government would not wholly fund the Heritage Center, she pressed the center to become more proactive in attracting tourists and generating income to pay for its own operational expenses. When the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 passed, Mankiller remained cautious about participating, though she acknowledged that other tribes had a right to do so. Concerned by research connecting gambling and crime, she did not endorse gaming for the Cherokee Nation. She also rejected requests for the tribe to store nuclear waste, given its potential to harm the environment. Eventually, she changed her stance and bingo parlors became a major revenue source for the tribe. 


Founding the Private Industry Council, Mankiller brought government and private businesses together to analyze ways to generate economic growth in northeastern Oklahoma. She established employment training opportunities and programs that offered financial and technical expertise to tribal members who wanted to start their own small enterprises. She also backed the creation of a tribal electronic harness and cabling company, construction of a hydroelectric plant and a horticultural operation. Another initiative launched soon after her installment was a claim of compensation from the U.S. government for misappropriating resources from the Arkansas River. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma&quot; that the Cherokee, Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations owned the banks and riverbed of the Arkansas River. At issue was whether the tribes were entitled to be paid for the loss of access to coal, gas and oil deposits, which could no longer be extracted as the United States Army Corps of Engineers had rerouted the river during the construction of the McClellan–Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System. The Cherokee then sued the United States for compensation, and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the tribe was entitled to it, though the claim was reversed by the Supreme Court. The three tribes filed a claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims in 1989 alleging &quot;mismanagement of tribal trust resources&quot;. 
In December 1988, Mankiller&#x27;s leadership was recognized with a national award bestowed by the Independent Sector, an umbrella group for non-profit organizations. The John W. Gardner Leadership Award recognized not only her community development projects, but also her administration of Cherokee Nation Industries, which had seen profits soar to over $2 million. In the middle of her first term, Mankiller was invited to the White House to meet with President Reagan to discuss Native peoples&#x27; grievances with his administration. Thinking that it was going to be a productive meeting, Mankiller, who had been chosen as one of the three spokespeople for the 16 invited chiefs, was disappointed that Reagan discounted their issues and merely reiterated his pledge for self-determination. Though she brushed off the meeting as a &quot;photo opportunity&quot; for the president, the publicity of the event further enhanced her image with the public. The most significant development in her first full term was the negotiation with the State of Oklahoma for tax sharing on businesses operating on Cherokee lands. The compact, signed by Governor David Walters and leadership of all of the Five Civilized Tribes except the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, allowed the chiefs to collect state taxes and retain a portion of the revenues. 
In June 1990, Mankiller&#x27;s kidney disease worsened and one of her kidneys failed. Her brother Don donated one of his kidneys, and she underwent a kidney transplant in July, returning to work within a few weeks. While she was in Boston recuperating from the transplant, she met with officials from Washington, D.C., and signed an agreement for the Cherokee Nation to participate in a project that allowed the tribe to self-govern and assume responsibility for the use of federal funds. This change in policy had come about because of allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hearings on the matter resulted in amendments in 1988 to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, to allow ten tribes to participate in a pilot program spanning five years. Tribes received block grants and were allowed to tailor the use of funds based on local needs. Further amendments in the early 1990s extended self-determination to the Indian Health Service. Mankiller welcomed the initiative, which reinforced intergovernmental cooperation and increased self-determination. During her first full administration, her government built new health clinics, created a mobile eye-care clinic and established ambulance services. They also created early education and adult education programs. Mankiller was recognized with an honorary degree from Yale University in 1990 and from Dartmouth College in 1991. 
Around the same time, the contentious relationship with the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians flared again. Under Swimmer, the Cherokee Nation had filed a lawsuit against the Keetoowah Band, which traditionally had allowed members to belong to both federally recognized tribes. Mankiller had hoped to reconcile the differences between the two tribes, but the tax compact created controversy. The Keetoowah Band refused to allow the Cherokee Nation to collect taxes from its members and began a policy of requiring their tribal members to withdraw from the Cherokee Nation, claiming to be the &quot;true&quot; tribe representing Cherokee people. Mankiller, whose administration had established a district court to deal with the problem of Indian country being in federal jurisdiction rather than falling under state or local law enforcement, began a practice in late 1990 of negotiating cross-deputation agreements with law enforcement agencies and the Cherokee Nation Marshal Service. (Cross-deputation became formally authorized in April 1991). Raids conducted by county officials and Cherokee Marshals on 14 smoke shops licensed by the Keetoowah Band were carried out in the fall of 1990. Officials of the band failed to obtain a restraining order against the Cherokee Nation and took their grievance to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Unable to resolve the matter, the federal courts stepped in and ruled that the smoke shops of the Keetoowah Band were not exempt from state taxes.

====Principal Chief, second elected term (1991–1995)====
In March 1991, Mankiller announced her candidacy for the next election and shortly thereafter was invited to meet with other Indian leaders at the White House with President George H. W. Bush. Bush&#x27;s officials, unlike Reagan&#x27;s, were receptive to input from tribal leaders, and Mankiller hoped that a new era of &quot;government-to-government relationships&quot; would follow. In the June election, she won 83% of the vote. One of her first actions was to participate in a conference on educational programs for Native Americans, where she strongly opposed centralizing Indian education. Similarly, she opposed legislation proposed by the Oklahoma House of Representatives to collect cigarette taxes on products sold at Indian smoke shops to non-Indians. In the continuing battle over compensation for the loss of access to mineral rights owned by the tribe in the Arkansas River, Mankiller estimated that one-third of her time as chief was spent on trying to obtain a settlement. 
During the school term of 1991–1992, Mankiller&#x27;s administration revived the tribal Sequoyah High School in Tahlequah. Working with the American Association of University Women, she worked on a grant program to match Cherokee mentors with girls attending the boarding school. The mentors shadowed the girls through their schooling and provided guidance on career opportunities. She also focused on issues of identity throughout her second term. Mankiller worked with tribal registrar Lee Fleming and a staff member Richard Allen to document groups which claimed Cherokee heritage, and they compiled a list of 269 associations throughout the country. After the passage of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, which provided both civil and criminal penalties for non-Native artists who promoted their work as &quot;Indian Art&quot;, the tribe had the ability to certify artisans who could not prove their ancestry. In two highly publicized cases, involving Willard Stone and Bert Seabourn, Stone was certified, but his family asked for his certification to be removed, and Seabourn was not certified as an artist, but instead as a &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot;. 
Mankiller was vocal in her disapproval of relaxing the rigorous Bureau of Indian Affairs&#x27; processes for tribal recognition, a stance for which she was frequently criticized. In 1993, she wrote to then-governor of Georgia Zell Miller, protesting the state recognition of groups claiming Cherokee and Muscogee (Creek) ancestry. She and other tribal leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes believed that the state recognition process could allow some groups to falsely claim Native heritage. During the congressional hearings on reform of the tribal recognition policies in Washington, D.C., Mankiller stated her opposition to any reform that would weaken the recognition process. During her tenure as chief, the Cherokee tribal council passed two resolutions to bar those without a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) from enrolling in the tribe. The 1988 &quot;Rules and Regulations of the Cherokee Registration Committee&quot; required applicants to possess a federal certification that they had ancestry linking them to the Dawes Rolls. The 1992 &quot;Act Relating to the Process of Enrolling as a Member of the Cherokee Nation&quot; enacted the policy into law, effectively barring Cherokee Freedmen from citizenship. Mankiller had reaffirmed &quot;Swimmer&#x27;s order on CDIBs and voting. But in 2004, Lucy Allen, a Freedman descendant, took the matter to the Cherokee Supreme Court, and the court, in a split decision, said that the descendants of Freemen were, in fact, Cherokee, could apply to be enrolled, and should have the right to vote.&quot; 
In 1992, Mankiller endorsed Bill Clinton for president, but did not donate any money to his campaign. She was invited to take part in an economic conference in Little Rock, Arkansas, and participated in his transition team for the presidency. Thanks to her access to high-level officials, she became the &quot;most influential Indian leader in the country&quot;. Her autobiography, &quot;Mankiller: A Chief and Her People&quot;, published in 1993, became a national best-seller. Gloria Steinem said in a review, &quot;As one woman&#x27;s journey, Mankiller opens the heart. As the history of a people, it informs the mind. Together, it teaches us that, as long as people like Wilma Mankiller carry the flame within them, centuries of ignorance and genocide can&#x27;t extinguish the human spirit&quot;. Steinem and Mankiller became close friends, and Steinem later married her partner David Bale in a ceremony at Mankiller Flats. In May, Mankiller received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Drury College; in June, she was honored with the American Association of University Women&#x27;s Achievement Award; and in October was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 1994, she was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, as well as the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas. That same year, Mankiller was invited by Clinton to moderate the Nation-to-Nation Summit, in which leaders of all 545 federally recognized tribes in the United States were assembled to discuss a variety of topics. The summit provided a forum for tribal leaders and government officials to resolve issues concerning jurisdiction, law, resources and religious freedom. It was followed by a conference held in Albuquerque, which included the U.S. Attorney General and Secretary of the Interior. As a result of the two meetings, the Office of Indian Justice was established by the Department of Justice. 
In 1995, Mankiller was diagnosed with lymphoma and chose not to run again, largely due to health problems. Because of the chemotherapy, Mankiller had to forgo the immunosuppressive drugs she had been taking since her transplant. When George Bearpaw was disqualified as a candidate, Joe Byrd succeeded her as Principal Chief. Mankiller refused to attend his inauguration, on the grounds that the disqualification of his rival was based on an expunged conviction of assault. Fearing that Byrd would fire the staff she had hired, Mankiller authorized severance packages for the workers in her final days in office. A lawsuit was filed by the new Chief on behalf of the Cherokee Nation against Mankiller, alleging embezzlement of tribal funds of $300,000 paid out to tribal officials and department heads who left at the end of her term in 1995. &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Mankiller&quot; was withdrawn by a vote of the tribal council. Reflecting on her chieftainship, Mankiller said, &quot;We&#x27;ve had daunting problems in many critical areas, but I believe in the old Cherokee injunction to &#x27;be of a good mind&#x27;. Today it&#x27;s called positive thinking&quot;. When Mankiller left office, the population of the Cherokee Nation had increased from 68,000 to 170,000 citizens. The tribe was generating annual revenues of approximately $25 million from a variety of sources, including factories, retail stores, restaurants and bingo operations. She had secured federal assistance of $125 million annually to assist with education, health, housing and employment programs. Having obtained the tribe&#x27;s grant for &quot;self-governance&quot;, federal oversight of tribal funds was minimized.

===Return to activism (1996–2010)===
Byrd&#x27;s administration became embroiled in a constitutional crisis, which he blamed on Mankiller, stating that her failure to attend his inauguration and lack of mentoring divided the tribe and left him without experienced advisors. His supporters also alleged that Mankiller was behind attempts to remove Byrd from office, an allegation she denied. She had remained silent on Byrd&#x27;s administration until he accused her of heading a conspiracy. Two months after Byrd was accused of improperly using federal funds, and a month after he blamed his administration&#x27;s issues on Mankiller, she went to Washington with her predecessor, Swimmer, to ask that the federal authorities allow the tribe to sort out their own problems. Despite calls from the US Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, for congressional intervention and Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe&#x27;s desire for presidential action, Mankiller continued to maintain that the problem was one of inexperienced leadership, in which she did not want to be involved. When an independent group of legal analysts, known as the &quot;Massad Commission&quot;, was assembled in 1997 to evaluate the problems in Byrd&#x27;s administration, Mankiller, in spite of her ongoing health concerns, was called to testify. She reiterated at the hearings that she believed the problems stemmed from poor advisors and the Chief&#x27;s lack of experience. 


After her term as chief, in 1996, Mankiller became a visiting professor at Dartmouth College, where she taught in the Native American Studies program as part of the school&#x27;s Montgomery Fellows program. That year, she was honored with the Elizabeth Blackwell Award from Hobart and William Smith Colleges for her exemplary service to humanity. After a semester, she began traveling on a national lecture tour, speaking on health care, tribal sovereignty, women&#x27;s rights and cancer awareness. She spoke to various civic organizations, tribal gatherings, universities and women&#x27;s groups. In 1997, she received an honorary degree from Smith College. In 1998, President Clinton awarded Mankiller the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. Shortly after that, she had a second kidney failure and received a second transplant, from her niece, Virlee Williamson. As previously, she immediately returned to work, resuming her lecture tours and working simultaneously on four books. In 1999 Mankiller was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double-lumpectomy followed by radiation treatment. That same year, &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Companion to U.S. Women&#x27;s History&quot;, co-edited by Mankiller, was published. 
In 2002, Mankiller contributed to the book &quot;That Takes Ovaries!: Bold Females and Their Brazen Acts&quot;, and in 2004, she co-authored &quot;Every Day Is a Good Day: Reflections by Contemporary Indigenous Women&quot;. The following year, she worked with the Oklahoma Breast Cancer Summit to encourage early screening and raise awareness on the disease. In 2006, when Mankiller, along with other Native American leaders, was asked to send a pair of shoes to the Heard Museum for the exhibit &quot;Sole Stories: American Indian Footwear&quot;, she sent a simple pair of walking shoes. She chose the shoes because she had worn them all over the world, including trips from Brazil to China, and because they conveyed the normalcy of her life as well as her durability, steadfastness and determination. In 2007, Mankiller gave the Centennial Lecture in the Humanities for Oklahoma&#x27;s 100th anniversary of statehood. After the lecture, she was honored with the inaugural Oklahoma Humanities Award by the Oklahoma Humanities Council. She continued her lecture tours and scholarship, and in September 2009 was named the first Sequoyah Institute Fellow at Northeastern State University.

==Death and legacy==
In March 2010, her husband announced that Mankiller was terminally ill with pancreatic cancer. Mankiller died on April 6, 2010, from cancer at her home in rural Adair County, Oklahoma. About 1,200 people attended her memorial service at the Cherokee National Cultural Grounds in Tahlequah on April 10, including many dignitaries such as sitting Cherokee Chief Chad Smith, Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry, U.S. Congressman Dan Boren and Gloria Steinem. The ceremony included statements from former President and First Lady Bill and Hillary Clinton, as well as then President Barack Obama. Mankiller was buried in the family cemetery, Echota Cemetery, in Stilwell, and a few days later was honored with a Congressional Resolution from the U.S. House of Representatives. She was posthumously presented with the Drum Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Five Civilized Tribes. 
Mankiller&#x27;s papers are housed in the Western History Collection at the University of Oklahoma, in Norman. With 14 honorary doctorates, she left a permanent mark on both her state and the nation, through her work to build communities and stewardship of her tribe. Over the course of her three terms as Principal Chief, Mankiller reinvigorated the Cherokee Nation through community development projects where men and women work collectively for the common good. Under the national policy of Native American self-determination, Mankiller improved federal–tribal negotiations and helped create and shepherd the government-to-government relationship that the Cherokee Nation now enjoys with the U.S. federal government. She was an inspiration to Native and non-Native Americans and a role model for women and girls. &quot;Prior to my election&quot;, Mankiller once said, &quot;young Cherokee girls would never have thought that they might grow up and become chief&quot;. At the 2010 annual women&#x27;s conference hosted by Women Empowering Women for Indian Nations (WEWIN) to promote and empower Indigenous women&#x27;s leadership, for which Mankiller had been a founding board member, a scholarship was named in her honor to pay travel expenses for women to attend the gathering. 
A 2013 feature film, &quot;The Cherokee Word for Water&quot;, tells the story of the Bell waterline project that helped launch Mankiller&#x27;s political career and started her friendship with her future husband, Charlie Soap. In the film, Mankiller is portrayed by actress Kimberly Norris Guerrero, and Soap is portrayed by actor Moses Brings Plenty. The film, produced by Kristina Kiehl and Soap, was a dream that involved more than 20 years of planning and fundraising. It was important to Mankiller that the story of the resilience of Native people be the focus of the film. The Mankiller Foundation, named in her honor, which focuses on educational, community and economic development projects, was involved in the production. In 2015, the Cherokee Nation completed construction on an addition to the Wilma P. Mankiller Health Center, located in Stilwell, doubling its size and updating its equipment. The center, one of the busiest of the eight hospitals in the Cherokee Nation Health Services system, serves approximately 120,000 patients annually. In 2017 a documentary film, &quot;Mankiller&quot;, produced by Valerie RedHorse Mohl, was released. Through interviews with those who knew her and archival records, the film tells the story of Mankiller&#x27;s life and her time as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. In 2018, Mankiller became one of the honorees in the first induction ceremony held by the National Native American Hall of Fame.

In 2021, it was announced that Mankiller, Maya Angelou, Sally Ride, Adelina Otero-Warren and Anna May Wong were each selected to have their likeness appear on a quarter-dollar coin as a part of the United States Mint&#x27;s &quot;American Women quarters&quot; Program.

In 2023, Mattel produced a Wilma Mankiller doll for their Barbie Inspiring Women series.

<text>JSC Research &amp; Development Production Enterprise Zvezda, or R&amp;D PE Zvezda (, lit. &quot;Star&quot;), is a Russian manufacturer of life-support systems for high-altitude flight and human spaceflight. Its products include space suits, ejector seats, aircraft escape slides, lifejackets and fire extinguishers. It is based in Tomilino, near Moscow.

Guy Illich Severin was the General Director and General Designer of the company from 1964 to 2008. Sergey S. Pozdnyakov has been General Director since 2008.

==History==
The organization was founded in 1952 to develop aviation pressure suits and in-flight refuelling systems for the USSR&#x27;s space research programme. In the 1960s it began to design space suits, including the one worn by Yuri Gagarin. In 1965, a Berkut spacesuit was worn during the first spacewalk. The Orlan-M space suit was used by cosmonauts in the Mir space station. Zvezda became a joint-stock company in 1994.

==Products==

Zvezda is also Russia&#x27;s primary manufacturer of ejector seats for Russian fighter aircraft. The K-36 ejector seat was studied at length by the US Navy and Air Force; IBP Aircraft (currently UTC Aerospace Systems) opened up a factory in the US to manufacture it for the F-22 Raptor and the Joint Strike Fighter. The US government, however, selected the Martin-Baker seat from the United Kingdom for its new fighter jet.

For improved pilot survivability, the Russian Kamov Ka-50 &quot;Black Shark&quot; helicopter is fitted with a NPP Zvezda K-37-800 ejection seat, which is a rare feature for a helicopter. Before the rocket in the ejection seat kicks in, rotor blades are blown away by explosive charges in the rotor disc and the canopy is similarly jettisoned. Also, there is a special ejection seat made for L-39 known as K-93.

The company has patented a lightweight ejection seat for general aviation aircraft, such as SKS-94, KS-2012.

The company also designed a unique complex consisting of ejection seat K-36RB for Buran space vehicle. The system is designed to allow the evacuation of the Buran as the crew at takeoff and landing.

<doc id="694482" wikidata="Q1418932" url="?curid=694482" title="Firefox (film)">
<text>Firefox is a 1982 American action techno-thriller film produced, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. It is based upon the 1977 novel of the same name by Craig Thomas.

The film was set in Russia, but Cold War considerations had Eastwood&#x27;s and Fritz Manes&#x27;s Malpaso Company using Vienna and other locations in Austria to double for many of the Eurasian story locations. One source indicates that the film was shot on a $21 million budget, the largest production budget ever for Malpaso. Another source indicates that over $20 million was spent on special effects.

==Plot==
A joint British-American plot is devised to steal a highly advanced Soviet fighter aircraft (MiG-31, NATO code name &quot;Firefox&quot;) which is capable of Mach 6 (hypersonic flight), is invisible to radar, and carries weapons controlled by thought. Former United States Air Force Major Mitchell Gant, a Vietnam veteran, ex member of the Aggressor squadron and former prisoner of war, infiltrates the Soviet Union, aided by his ability to speak and think in Russian (due to his having had a Russian mother) and a network of Soviet dissidents, three of whom are key scientists working on the fighter itself. His goal is to steal the Firefox and fly it back to friendly territory for analysis.

However, the KGB has got wind of the operation and is already looking for Gant. It is only through the dissidents that Gant remains one step ahead of the KGB and reaches the air base at Bilyarsk, where the Firefox prototype is under heavy guard. The dissidents working on the Firefox help Gant infiltrate the base. Pyotr Baranovich, one of the scientists, briefs Gant on the operation of the aircraft but warns him that there is a second prototype in the hangar that must be destroyed. The diversion will allow Gant to enter the hangar and escape with the first Firefox. Gant knocks out Lt. Colonel Yuri Voskov, a Soviet pilot assigned to take the first prototype on a test flight during a visit from the Soviet First Secretary. The scientists cause an explosive disruption, but the second prototype is undamaged. Baranovich is singled out for execution but manages to kill one of the guards with a concealed pistol before he and the other scientists are shot. Gant uses the commotion to enter the Firefox and fly it off the base.

Evading the Soviets&#x27; attempts to stop him, Gant barely reaches the Arctic ice pack and lands, making a rendezvous with a U.S. submarine whose crew refuels and rearms the aircraft. However, Gant&#x27;s last-minute refusal to kill Voskov has consequences; the Soviet pilot flies the second prototype, with orders to intercept him at the North Cape area. Gant completes the rendezvous and is on the way home when Voskov engages him in a dogfight. After a long battle, Gant finally remembers to fire one of his rearward missiles and Voskov&#x27;s plane is destroyed. Satisfied that there are no other Soviet forces chasing him, Gant begins his flight to safety.

==Production==

The film was based on the creation of a &quot;mythical&quot; super fighter: the MiG-31 Firefox. The original Firefox from the novel was, cosmetically, nearly identical to the MiG-25. The more intimidating version seen in the movie was created specifically for the film, and takes many of its design cues from the SR-71 Blackbird. In the sequel novel, &quot;Firefox Down,&quot; the Firefox&#x27;s appearance is described as matching the one in the film. For filming, four large-scale replicas were created, along with one full-size model that had dimensions of 66 feet long, 44 feet wide, and 20 feet high. The full-size model was built from a radio station broadcast-antenna skeleton and was capable of taxiing at 30–40 mph.

Filming occurred in 1981 at a number of locations including Vienna, Austria; Montana; California; London and Greenland&#x27;s Thule Air Force Base. Second unit filming was in San Diego, California. Hollywood aerial cinematographer Clay Lacy flew second unit aerial sequences in a Learjet 23 high-speed aerial platform, for scenes that were later integrated into the film.

Special effects supervisor John Dykstra pioneered a new technique for shooting the complex flying sequences, called reverse blue-screen photography. This involved coating the model with phosphorus paint and photographing it first with strong lighting against a black background and then with ultraviolet light to create the necessary male and female mattes to separate the foreground model and the background footage. This enabled the shiny black model to be photographed flying against a clear blue sky and gleaming white snow; compare this with traditional bluescreen technique used in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot; The original scale model made by Gregory Jein used in the bluescreen work is now on display at the Warner Bros. Museum.

==Reception==
Author Howard Hughes gave &quot;Firefox&quot; a negative review, &quot;Watch the trailer, read the book, play the game — just avoid the film, it&#x27;s another &quot;Eiger Sanction&quot;. Less a &#x27;Firefox&#x27;, it&#x27;s more of a damp squib, or at best a smoldering turkey.&quot; Vincent Canby&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; made a similar assessment, zeroing in on Eastwood&#x27;s lack of control over the plot line. &quot;&quot;Firefox&quot; is only slightly more suspenseful than it is plausible. It&#x27;s a James Bond movie without girls, a Superman movie without a sense of humor.&quot; However, Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, describing it as &quot;a slick, muscular thriller that combines espionage with science fiction. The movie works like a well-crafted machine.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film as &quot;a burn-out. Lethargic, characterless and, at 137 minutes, at least a half-hour too long.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that it was &quot;generally entertaining,&quot; but &quot;would be a lot more so if Eastwood, who served as producer-director, had excised some of the laborious buildup to the final shootout. Instead, we are asked to sit through some boring patches in which he avoids detection by Russian security officers, who seem to speak Russian or English whenever they like. What&#x27;s uninteresting about all of this is that we know that Clint is going to make it to the plane. So, let&#x27;s get on with it.&quot; Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a sagging, overlong disappointment, talky and slow to ignite. It is the first time that Eastwood the director has served Eastwood the actor-icon so badly, and it is unnerving.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Both loyal fans and neutral observers may agree that Eastwood has steered himself into a peculiarly murky flight path on this occasion,&quot; calling the plot &quot;far-fetched&quot; and expressing disappointment that &quot;the Firefox doesn&#x27;t look all that formidable on the screen ... The only in-flight special effect that stirs the imagination is the parallel curtains of water that suddenly erupt in the wake of the plane as it whooshes across the ocean.&quot;

As of August 2023, the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 41% based on reviews from 17 critics.

==Video game==
A laserdisc arcade game, based on the movie, was released by Atari in 1983.

<doc id="694483" wikidata="Q731504" url="?curid=694483" title="Erik Scavenius">
<text>Erik Julius Christian Scavenius (; 13 July 1877 – 29 November 1962) was the Danish foreign minister from 1909 to 1910, 1913 to 1920 and 1940 to 1943, and prime minister from 1942 to 1943, during the occupation of Denmark until the Danish elected government ceased to function. He was the foreign minister during some of the most important periods of Denmark&#x27;s modern history, including the First World War, the plebiscites over the return of northern Schleswig to Denmark, and the German occupation. Scavenius was a member of the Landsting (the upper house of the Danish parliament before 1953) from 1918 to 1920 and from 1925 to 1927 representing the Social Liberal Party. He was chairman of its party organization from 1922 to 1924.

Scavenius belonged to a tradition of elite governance that distrusted democratically elected politicians at a time when they were gaining power and influence. He believed that many of them were influenced by ignorant strains of populism and ill-equipped to face tough compromises and realities. For example, during the negotiations over the return of territory to Denmark following the First World War, he advocated a more cautious approach than many more nationalistic figures. He believed that areas that were mostly German should stay in Germany.

His policy of accommodation and compromise toward the Nazi occupation authorities in Denmark during the Second World War is one of the enduring controversies of Danish history. Some see it as a necessary compromise to protect the Danish state and people, but others see it as unnecessarily accommodating of totalitarian Nazi Germany.

==Early life==
The Scavenius family belongs to the Danish nobility. It was in the family tradition to work as a diplomat. Scavenius graduated in economics from the University of Copenhagen in 1901. Soon afterward, he became employed in the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was a secretary at the Danish Embassy in Berlin from 1906 to 1908, a time forming his emphasis upon the primacy of Danish-German relations. Then, he became head of section in the ministry.

==Political career==
===Diplomatic and civil career===
He was an envoy to Vienna and Rome from 1912 to 1913 and to Stockholm from 1924 to 1932. From 1932 to 1940, he was chairman of the board of the major daily Politiken. Scavenius was the owner of a large estate from 1915 to 1946. After 1945, he experienced marital and economic difficulties.

===Foreign minister===
The appointment of the 32-year-old head of section Scavenius as minister of foreign affairs in the Radical Left Social Liberal cabinet Danish: Det Radikale Venstre (1909–1910) came as a surprise. He was reappointed when the party formed another cabinet in 1913. During World War I, he strongly put his efforts into the continuation of &quot;the German course&quot;, a policy of keeping Denmark out of conflict with its neighbouring great power through adaptation. Among other things he supported giving in to the German demands to mine the Danish straits in August 1914.

Scavenius was also an important figure as foreign minister during the negotiations surrounding the return of parts of Schleswig to Denmark following the war. Scavenius was one of the chief advocates of the Danish government&#x27;s official position, advocating a return of only territories with clear Danish majorities (see Easter Crisis of 1920). That was opposed to the more &quot;maximalist&quot; position which demanded a return of all previously Danish territories south to the &quot;Danevirke&quot;.

===Occupation of Denmark===

Scavenius became foreign minister again during most of the German occupation of Denmark. As such, he was the most important liaison between the Danish government and the German authorities. In addition, he was prime minister for some of the war as head of a coalition cabinet after the Telegram Crisis. He was more of a professional diplomat than an elected politician and held an elitist approach to government. At this time, the Social Liberal Party did not consider Scavenius to be its representative although the party accepted his line, along with the other coalition parties.

Scavenius was concerned that emotional public opinion would destabilise his attempts to build a compromise between Danish sovereignty and the realities of occupation. He felt strongly that he was Denmark&#x27;s most ardent defender. After the war, there was much recrimination of his stance, particularly from members of the active resistance, who felt that he had hindered the cause of resistance and threatened Denmark&#x27;s national honour. He felt that these people were vain and seeking to build their own reputations or political careers through emotionalism.

After 29 August 1943, Erik Scavenius lost all of his real powers when the German authorities dissolved the Danish government following the refusal of that government to crack down on unrest to the satisfaction of the German plenipotentiary. His cabinet resigned in 1943 and suspended operations. The resignation was never formally accepted by King Christian X of Denmark so the cabinet existed &quot;de jure&quot;, until a new one was formed following the liberation on 5 May 1945. Scavenius was politically isolated after 1945, but the parliamentary commission on misconduct during the Occupation did not find reason to impeach him for the High Court of the Realm for maladministration of office in its report in 1955.

==Legacy==
Debate continues over his legacy, and he remains one of the most controversial figures in the history of Danish politics. For example, on the 60th anniversary of the 29 August dissolution of government, prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen chastised his predecessor for his stance, saying that it was naive and morally unacceptable. However, historians like Bo Lidegaard and Søren Mørch contend that it was only through Scavenius&#x27;s policies that Denmark escaped the worst hardships of the war. Bertel Haarder, then a minister in the Rasmussen government, rebutted Lidegaard&#x27;s theory in 2005, calling it revisionist and arguing that Scavenius carried out an unnecessarily pro-German policy, which was unpopular, dishonourable, and unjustifiable long-term, as he thought that Germany was likely to win the war.

Papers found in the Danish Royal Library revealed that in 1961, Scavenius had been informed that he would be awarded the Israeli &quot;Medallion of Valor&quot;. The medallion was due to be presented to him by Eleanor Roosevelt at a ceremony in the United States later that year, but his poor health made Scavenius cancel his appearance. Unknown circumstances caused the medallion to be never officially awarded to him.

<text>Pospolite ruszenie (, lit. &quot;mass mobilization&quot;; &quot;Noble Host&quot;, , the French term &quot;levée en masse&quot; is also used) was the wartime mobilisation of all or a specific part of able-bodied male population of the state into armed forces during the period of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The tradition of wartime mobilisation of part of the population existed from before the 13th century to the 19th century. In the later era, &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; units were formed from the &quot;szlachta&quot; (Polish &quot;nobility&quot;). The &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; was eventually outclassed by professional forces.

== Rise ==
Before the 13th century, the feudal levy of knights was the customary method employed in the raising of Polish armies in the Kingdom of Poland of the Late Middle Ages. The earliest mentions of the term can be traced to the reign of Władysław I the Elbow-high (1320–1333). Statutes of Casimir the Great made the service in the military obligatory for all knights-landowners, under the penalty of land confiscation. The more wealthy knights provided a lances fournies unit (known in Poland as &quot;kopia&quot;), and the less prosperous ones served as a light horseman or even infantryman. They were obliged to take arms and defend the country, and to participate in wars in foreign lands.

As the knights (later, nobles - the szlachta class) started to acquire privileges, some of them began to change the way that the &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; functioned. The length of the service was set at two weeks. The Privilege of Buda of 1355 required the king to compensate any losses incurred by the nobles in wars abroad, and the Privilege of Koszyce of 1374 required him to pay the ransom for any nobles taken into captivity during wars abroad. A privilege of 1388 extended that compensation for losses incurred when defending the country and confirmed that the nobles were to receive a monetary wage for their participation and that they should be consulted with by the king beforehand.

The early &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; also put the requirement of military service on the landowning knights in the priesthood, and on the peasant leaders (sołtys and wójts). The few townsfolk who owned land estates would also have the obligation to serve. It could be called by the king, or in his absence and in dire need, from the 14th century, the starost of the affected territory. From 1454 another privilege (the Privilege of Cerkwica, confirmed the same year by the Statutes of Nieszawa) made the calling of a pospolite ruszenie conditional on the agreement of the local sejmik (regional parliament) and, by the end of the 15th century, this required the agreement of the national parliament, the sejm. Some of the above privileges were extorted by the szlachta from the king, as a &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; was known to refuse to act unless more privileges were granted to it (this was the case, for example, in 1454).

&quot;Pospolite ruszenie&quot; units were usually organized based on a territorial and administrative division of Kingdom of Poland (later, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), within units known as voivodeships (Latin &#x27;palatinate&#x27;), and smaller ones. The knights (nobles) would be gathered by castellans and voivodes, who led them to the chosen points where the command would pass to the military commanders (hetmans) or the king. The units would be organized into units of about 50-120 strong (chorągiew), based on their territorial origin. There were some exceptions, as the most powerful magnates would form their own chorągiews.

==Decline==
&quot;Szlachta&quot; from regions like the Commonwealth&#x27;s eastern and southern borderlands, where combat was common, created fairly competent units, while those from peaceful regions of the Commonwealth lacked battle experience and training compared to regular-military troops or mercenaries. In time, &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; became increasingly amateurish and inefficient when compared to professional soldiers; Bardach notes that this process can be seen as early as the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–66). In addition to the lack of training, discipline and unstandardized equipment, the time it took for a pospolite ruszenie to be called to arms and gathered in a designed spot (often, close to a month) was also a problem. Some attempts at reform the situation, including a mass wave of estate confiscations at 1497, and a requirement for yearly gatherings and reviews, did little to ameliorate the situation.

From the 15th century, &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; levies were used less often than were professional military troops. By mid-16th century, pospolite ruszenie could, in theory, have fielded about 50,000 troops.

By the 17th century, the military value of the &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; was very limited, and was last called to participate in the Battle of Warsaw of 1656 during The Deluge (the battle ended with a Polish defeat). Nonetheless, the &quot;szlachta&quot; continued to believe they formed an elite army, and that their participation in the defense of the country was an important reason for their privileged position in it. As this was used as a justifications for lower taxation, the Commonwealth treasury found itself increasingly starved for funds to pay to regular, standing army. With the Commonwealth Army reduced by that time to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to overpower its armies (the Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000; the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army, 200,000).

==Final reforms, partitions and the Second Polish Republic==
During the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, under the influence of revolutionary France and Enlightenment ideas about the role of the militia, &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; was redefined as consisted of not only the nobility, but all able-bodied males between 18 and 40 years of age. In 1806, by decree of Napoleon, the &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; in the Duchy of Warsaw served for a short period as the reserve force and recruitment pool for the regular army. During the November Uprising in 1831, the &quot;Sejm&quot; (Polish Parliament) called for &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; recruits from the ages of 17 to 50, but that plan was opposed by General Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki.

During the Second Republic of Poland (1918–1939), the &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; consisted of reserve soldiers, aged 40–50 and officers, aged 50–60. They were required to participate in army exercises and to serve in armed forces during times of war.

<doc id="694502" wikidata="Q1045076" url="?curid=694502" title="Carrier Routing System">
<text>Carrier Routing System (CRS) is a modular and distributed core router developed by Cisco Systems Inc that enables service providers to deliver data, voice, and video services over a scalable IP Next-Generation Network (NGN) infrastructure. In a network topology, these routers are generally positioned in the core or edge of a service provider network. They are also used by Over-the-top content providers and large enterprises. It supports a wide range of interface speeds and types such as channelized OC3, OC12 to OC768 on Packet over SONET and from 1GE, 10GE all the way to 100GE on the Ethernet technologies. A standalone CRS-3 system can handle 2.2 Tbit/s and a multi-chassis system could be designed to handle 322 Tbit/s.

==Architecture==

A standalone Carrier Routing System is deployed with a Line card chassis (LCC). The three main functional units of this LCC are the Line cards, Switching fabric and Route processor. The Line card consists of the physical interface card and a modular services card. The physical connectivity could be using fiber-optic cables or using Twisted pair cables. The routing decisions are made by the route processor and the switching fabric takes care of the routing based on the Route processor input. The CRS runs IOS XR which is said to be designed for high-end carrier grade routers and was launched with CRS-1. In a multi-chassis deployment, the Line card chassis is used along with another variety of chassis called as the Fabric Card Chassis (FCC). The architecture enables scalability by increasing the number of Line Card Chassis and/or Fabric Card Chassis. In both single- and multi-chassis configurations, the CRS switch fabrics are based on a three-stage Benes architecture. In a single-chassis system, the three switching stages—S1, S2, and S3—are all contained on one fabric card. In a multi-chassis system, the S2 stage is contained within the Fabric Card Chassis, with the S1 and S3 stages resident in the Line Card Chassis.

The CRS Line card chassis comes in three different flavors: 4-slot, 8-slot and 16-slot. The number of slots indicates the number of line cards that the chassis can accommodate. There is only one variety of Fabric card chassis.

==Product Portfolio==

===CRS-X===
Cisco Systems has announced the addition of a new product to its existing CRS family, the Carrier Routing System X, or CRS-X (C-R-S-Ten), which is expected to be 10 times faster than the first CRS model (CRS-1) the company offered, back in 2004. CRS-X is said to be a 400 Gbit/s per slot system and is backward compatible with the previous generation HW. At the time of launch, CRS-X family has three different flavors of physical interface card (40x10GE, 4x100GE and 2x100GE-Flex-40) apart from the improved fabric and modular service cards.

Cisco states that the CRS-X can be used in back-to-back &amp; multi-chassis deployments and that CRS-1, CRS-3 &amp; CRS-X can co-exist in a multi-chassis setup. The press release (reference) also claims that, the CRS-X 400 GE Line Card with Cisco AnyPort Technology uses Cisco’s CMOS photonic CPAK to reduce power consumption, heat dissipation and increase 100 GE port densities by a factor of three compared to competitive solutions. The Universal Port concept adds the option of using a 100G port as 2 ports of 40G or 10 ports of 10G. 40G can again be used as 4 ports 10G. This product will go up against Juniper Networks’ T4000 and PTX core routing systems and perhaps Alcatel-Lucent’s 7950 XRS.

===CRS-3===
The CRS-3 is the second generation of the CRS series launched in March, 2010. In CRS-3 each line card slot has a capacity of 140 Gbits/s, which is more than three times the capacity of the previous CRS-1 generation. The architecture is retained as in the previous generation and hardware is compatible with the CRS-1 system. Apart from the single-chassis system and the multi-chassis system, CRS-3 supports back-to-back configuration as well. In this configuration, two Line Card Chassis are connected back-to-back and there is no Fabric Card Chassis involved as in the case of a multi-chassis configuration. This configuration works only for the 8-slot and 16-slot chassis models. CRS-3 also supports IPoDWDM. This solution reduces transport elements, while supporting multilayer features such as proactive protection and control plane interaction, reducing operating expenses and capital costs. AT&amp;T Corporation tested the CRS-3 in a live-network using the 100 Gb Ethernet backbone and the Dutch telco KPN Telecom selected the CRS-3 platform for their new NextGen IP backbone.


===CRS-1===
CRS-1 is the first generation of Carrier Routing System launched in 2004. This replaced the Cisco 12000 routers which were used as core routers. Each slot of CRS-1 has a capacity of 40 Gbit/s. CRS-1 supports both standalone and multi-chassis configurations.

<doc id="694503" wikidata="Q3337010" url="?curid=694503" title="NationsBank">
<text>NationsBank was one of the largest banking corporations in the United States, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company named NationsBank was formed through the merger of several other banks in 1991, and prior to that had been through multiple iterations. Its oldest predecessor companies had been Commercial National Bank (CNB), formed in 1874, and American Trust Company founded in 1909. In 1998, NationsBank acquired BankAmerica, and modified that better-known name to become Bank of America Corporation. The CEO of NationsBank throughout its entire existence was Hugh McColl, who led the merger with BankAmerica and became the first CEO of the present-day Bank of America.

==History==
===Background and founding===

NationsBank traced its roots to two banks in Charlotte. Commercial National Bank (CNB), the earliest forerunner of NationsBank, was formed in 1874. American Trust Company was founded a few blocks down Tryon Street in 1909.

In 1957, American Trust merged with Commercial National to form American Commercial Bank. American Trust was the nominal survivor, and its president, Addison Reese, became president of the merged bank. Only four years later, in 1960, American Commercial merged with Greensboro-based Security National Bank to form North Carolina National Bank (NCNB). Although American Commercial was the nominal survivor, it gave up its North Carolina state charter and took over Security&#x27;s national charter. In 1969, NCNB reorganized as a holding company, NCNB Corporation.

In 1973 Reese was succeeded as CEO by Tom Storrs, who the next year turned the presidency of NCNB over to then 39-year-old Hugh McColl, who began an aggressive period of expansion. This was initially a defensive move. At the time, it was feared that the New York City money center banks might devour local Southern banks. It was believed that the only way to prevent this was if the stronger banks in the region became too rich to be taken over. NCNB expanded beyond North Carolina for the first time in 1982, when it purchased Lake City, Florida–based First National Bank of Lake City. McColl became CEO of NCNB the following year. McColl would remain CEO until 2001, usually as president and intermittently as chairman.

===Mergers and acquisitions===

In 1988, NCNB&#x27;s assets grew to $60 billion after it bought the failed First RepublicBank Corporation of Dallas, Texas from the FDIC. FirstRepublic, the largest bank in Texas, had entered FDIC receivership after filing bankruptcy in March, and was the largest FDIC bank failure in history.

By that time, NCNB had become associated with &quot;mergers, acquisitions, expansion, integration&quot;. From 1989 to 1992, NCNB acquired over 200 thrifts and community banks, many of these through the Resolution Trust program. Favorable terms, with the FDIC assuming most of the loan portfolios and absorbing mark-to-market losses, allowed NCNB to expand profitably, and a cost-cutting culture improved margins. Eventually, NCNB built a branch network stretching from Virginia to Florida, in addition to Texas.

In 1989, NCNB tried to become even more powerful by launching a hostile bid for Citizens &amp; Southern Corporation of Atlanta, which had been the South&#x27;s biggest bank for much of the 20th century until NCNB passed it. Partly as a defensive measure, C&amp;S merged with Sovran Financial Corporation of Norfolk, Virginia to form C&amp;S/Sovran.

Only two years later, however, C&amp;S/Sovran was nearly brought down by problem loans in the Washington, D.C./Northern Virginia market, and was all but forced to merge with NCNB to form NationsBank. This created the largest bank in the Southeast, with assets of $118 billion. The merger allowed NCNB/NationsBank to enter Tennessee and Maryland for the first time. At one stroke, it became a major player in Georgia and Virginia, where it previously had a minimal presence.

===Growth in the 1990s===
In July 1992, NationsBank agreed to invest $200 million in Maryland National Corporation for a 16 percent nonvoting stake and an option to buy the whole company, which it subsequently executed in February 1993.

In March 1993, NationsBank acquired Chicago Research and Trading Group, expanding into derivatives and dramatically increasing foreign exchange trading.

In September 1995, NationsBank announced the acquisition of Bank South Corp for $1.6 billion in stock. The deal significantly increased NationsBank&#x27;s already large presence in Atlanta.

In 1996, NationsBank acquired St. Louis–based Boatmen&#x27;s Bancshares for $9.6 billion. The combined bank became the largest in the American South, with assets of $225 billion, and 2,600 branches stretching from North Carolina to New Mexico.

The following year, NationsBank acquired Florida&#x27;s largest bank, Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank, for $15.5 billion, increasing the company&#x27;s total assets to $284 billion.

In June 1997, NationsBank acquired Montgomery Securities in a $1.2 billion transaction. Montgomery was integrated into the firm&#x27;s existing broker-dealer, NationsBanc Capital Markets, and the combined subsidiary was renamed NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.

===Bank of America merger===
In 1998, it acquired BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco in what was the largest bank merger in American history at the time. Although NationsBank was the nominal survivor, the merged bank took the better-known Bank of America name, and operates under Bank of America&#x27;s charter. However, to this day it is headquartered in Charlotte at what is now Bank of America Corporate Center, and retains NCNB/NationsBank&#x27;s pre-1998 stock price history. With this merger, all of NationsBank&#x27;s holdings, including some of the tallest buildings in the nation (including Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta and the Bank of America Corporate Center) took Bank of America&#x27;s name. McColl became chairman and CEO of the merged company with Bank of America&#x27;s David Coulter as president, but Coulter was quickly forced out in favor of NationsBank executive Ken Lewis. In 2001, McColl handed his remaining posts to Lewis, who began his career at NCNB in 1969. Lewis stepped down in 2009 and was replaced by Brian Moynihan—marking the first time that the bank had not been led by someone with roots in NCNB/NationsBank.

BankAmerica&#x27;s broker-dealer, BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, was integrated into NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, and the combined subsidiary was renamed Banc of America Securities, headquartered in Charlotte.

<doc id="694504" wikidata="Q5272634" url="?curid=694504" title="Dick Assman">
<text>Richard Arthur Assman (February 14, 1934 – August 15, 2016) was a Canadian gas station employee whose name propelled him to celebrity status across North America for four months in 1995.

==Career==
In 1995, Assman moved from working at one Petro-Canada station to another. The latter station&#x27;s owner took out an advertisement in the local newspaper that was sent anonymously to David Letterman, who was amused by Assman&#x27;s name. Assman was introduced on July 24, 1995, on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, where he was a nightly feature for about a month. During this time, he was known as &quot;Assman the Gasman&quot;.

Live field units in Canada interviewed him for the show. Over the weeks, Joe Namath declared himself an &quot;Ass-maniac&quot;, while Assman received a musical tribute from Tony Orlando on Letterman:

&lt;poem&gt;
Northgate Petro-Canada
Oh, they&#x27;re relocating
Their new office at Victoria Square
They&#x27;re celebrating
Oh vaya con dios, Dick Assman
Vaya con dios, my love
&lt;/poem&gt;

As his fame grew, Vancouver polling company Angus Reid Public Opinion reported that 49 percent of surveyed Canadians in September 1995 had heard of his name. Assman received a number of contracts for commercial appearances, was asked to run for public office, and received many marriage proposals. He received a request to judge a bikini contest in August 1995 for the Janetville Jamboree and Truck Pull in Janetville, Ontario. &quot;Assmania&quot; came to a close in August when Assman visited the Ed Sullivan Theater and was presented with a bouquet of roses by Letterman.

In October 1995, James Blanchard, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, paid a visit to Assman at his gas station, citing his status as &quot;an international celebrity&quot;.

Assman or Assmann is a German-language surname derived from the name Erasmus. Dick Assman himself, who took all this ribbing good-naturedly, pronounced his name &quot;oss-man&quot;.

==Personal life==
Assman was born in Neudorf, Saskatchewan, to Adolf and Elizabeth Assman. He died on August 15, 2016.

Another Saskatchewan resident surnamed Assman, Dave Assman of Melville, Saskatchewan, earned notoriety in 2019 when he attempted to get a vanity licence plate with his surname on it; when Saskatchewan Government Insurance rejected his request, he had a tailgate-sized replica of an &quot;ASSMAN&quot; licence plate painted on the back of his truck, mimicking an episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. News reports did not indicate if Dick and Dave Assman were related, but did note both pronounced their names the same way and were of German descent.

<text>KOMO-TV (channel 4) is a television station in Seattle, Washington, United States, affiliated with ABC. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside Bellevue-licensed CW affiliate KUNS-TV (channel 51). The two stations share studios within KOMO Plaza (formerly Fisher Plaza) in the Lower Queen Anne section of Seattle adjacent to the Space Needle; KOMO-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Queen Anne neighborhood.

KOMO-TV signed on in December 1953 as the flagship station of Seattle-based Fisher Broadcasting; originally an NBC affiliate, it was the television extension to KOMO (1000 AM), which was a sister station until 2021. The station became Seattle&#x27;s ABC affiliate in 1959 when KING-TV affiliated with NBC after a year-long transition period; it has generally ranked second in the city&#x27;s television market ratings behind KING-TV throughout its existence.

==History==
===Beginnings===
KOMO-TV began operating on December 11, 1953, as an NBC affiliate, owing to KOMO radio&#x27;s long-time relationship with the NBC Radio Network. It is the fourth-oldest television station in the Seattle–Tacoma area. KOMO also has an almost forgotten distinction as being the first station in Seattle to broadcast a television signal. Whereas crosstown rival KRSC-TV (channel 5, now KING-TV) was the first to air &quot;wide audience&quot; television in November 1948, KOMO broadcast a television signal nearly 20 years prior on an experimental basis. On June 3, 1929, KOMO radio engineer Francis J. Brott televised images of a heart, a diamond, a question mark, letters, and numbers over electrical lines to small sets with one-inch screens—23 years before KOMO-TV&#x27;s first regular broadcasts. A handful of viewers were captivated by the broadcast. KOMO would likely have held the distinction of being the first television station in Seattle, and perhaps the nation, if it were not for the occurrences of the Great Depression and World War II.

The station was originally owned by the Fisher family, which had its start in the flour mill and lumber businesses. The Fishers branched into broadcasting with its founding of KOMO radio in 1926. In competing for the channel 4 construction permit, the Fishers faced off against the then-owners of KJR radio. KOMO was awarded the license in June 1953 after the KJR group dropped their bid, and KOMO-TV first signed on the air only five months later. William W. Warren, general manager of KOMO radio and a nephew of KOMO co-founder Oliver D. Fisher, oversaw the development of KOMO-TV and remained involved with the station&#x27;s management until his retirement in 1987.

In 1954, a KOMO news photographer discovered a way to develop color film in a new process that took just a few hours instead of days. His discovery allowed KOMO-TV to become the first television station in the nation to broadcast in true color.

In October 1958, however, NBC signed affiliation deals with King Broadcasting Company for their radio and television properties in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, channel 4 shared both ABC and NBC programming with KING-TV until September 27, 1959, when KING-TV took the NBC affiliation full-time. At that point, KOMO-TV became an exclusive ABC affiliate.

During the 1960s, local television personality Don McCune became well known in the Seattle market for two programs seen on KOMO-TV. Thousands of children in the area knew McCune as &quot;Captain Puget&quot;, his role while hosting a children&#x27;s entertainment program. Channel 4 and McCune also produced the documentary series &quot;Exploration Northwest&quot;, which explored many of the places and people of the Pacific Northwest.

===Mount St. Helens eruption, May 18, 1980===

KOMO-TV nearly lost one of its staff in the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980. Dave Crockett, who had been with the station since 1975, had been covering the mountain every day for three weeks until being rotated out a few days prior. On the morning of May 18, he woke up at 3:00 a.m. in Seattle on a hunch that he would get some impressive video that day, and loaded up his news car and headed towards Mount St. Helens without anyone at KOMO knowing about it. He arrived at the mountain just as it was erupting. His news video, which shows an advancing ash cloud and mud flows down the South Fork Toutle River, was made famous by its eleven-minute long &quot;journey into the dark&quot;, six of those minutes of which were recorded in &quot;total darkness&quot; as Crockett narrated to what he thought would be his &quot;last day on Earth.&quot; His video made worldwide news and was used in a movie remake of the disaster starring Art Carney. The car he drove, with the remains of KOMO lettering still visible, is now a part of a Mount St. Helens Volcano Museum just outside Toutle.

===1984–present===
In 1984, KOMO became the first television station to broadcast daily programming in full stereo sound.

In 1994, KOMO applied for the first test license for broadcasting new high-definition signals. KOMO began broadcasting a high-definition digital signal in 1997; on May 18, 1999, KOMO became the first television station in the United States to broadcast its daily newscasts in high definition. This statement, however, comes into conflict with a claim made by WFAA in Dallas (a sister station to KING-TV) that it is the first station in the nation to broadcast its daily news programs in high definition, on February 28, 1997. It also conflicts with WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina.

On July 2, 2009, a large electrical fire that started in an electrical vault at the Fisher Plaza complex at 11:15 p.m. that evening knocked KOMO off the air during its 11 p.m. newscast.

On April 10, 2013, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Fisher Communications for $373.3 million. However, the deal was subjected to financial scrutiny; the law firm Levi &amp; Korsinsky notified Fisher shareholders with accusations that Fisher&#x27;s board of directors were breaching fiduciary duties by &quot;failing to adequately shop the Company before agreeing to enter into the transaction&quot;, and Sinclair was underpaying for Fisher&#x27;s stock. Shortly after the announcement, a lawsuit was filed by a Fisher shareholder. On August 6, the shareholders voted to approve the sale, after they approved that the shareholders would get $41 per share. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted approval of the deal on August 6, and the sale was consummated on August 8. Prior to the sale, KOMO-TV had been the last television station in the Seattle market to be owned by local interests, having been built by Fisher from the ground up.

On March 18, 2014, KOMO-TV&#x27;s news helicopter crashed at the Seattle Center, as it was taking off from Fisher Plaza around 7:40 a.m., falling onto at least one car. A second car and pickup truck, also involved, caught fire. Fuel from the crashed helicopter, which was leased to the station by St. Louis-based Helicopters Inc. and was also used by KING-TV under a Local News Service agreement, ran down Broad Street (along and south of the crash site), later bursting into flames. Helicopter pilot Gary Pfitzner and photographer Bill Strothman were both killed in the crash. A 37-year-old man in one of the cars was also critically injured, reportedly suffering burns covering up to 20% of his body (revised from an earlier report of burns at up to 50%) according to the Seattle Fire Department. The Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter involved in the crash, FAA registration number N250FB, had been leased to KOMO-TV while technical upgrades were being made to the station&#x27;s own helicopter.

On September 27, 2015, KOMO introduced a new studio for its newscasts, which was designed by Devlin Design Group—Sinclair&#x27;s primary set design firm. The new design contains nods to Seattle&#x27;s scenery, including tribal designs on the floor, a desk inspired by whale pods, as well as a helicopter blade—serving as a memorial to Pfitzner and Strothman.

On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media—owner of Fox affiliate KCPQ (channel 13) and MyNetworkTV affiliate KZJO (channel 22)—for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune, pending regulatory approval by the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division. As KOMO and KCPQ rank among the four highest-rated stations in the Seattle−Tacoma market in total day viewership and broadcasters are not currently allowed to legally own more than two full-power television stations in a single market, the companies would have been required to sell either the KOMO/KUNS or the KCPQ/KZJO duopolies to another station group in order to comply with FCC ownership rules preceding approval of the acquisition; however, a sale of either station to an independent buyer was dependent on later decisions by the FCC regarding local ownership of broadcast television stations and future acts by Congress. After speculation that Sinclair would keep KOMO-TV and KUNS-TV and sell KCPQ and KZJO to Fox Television Stations, it announced on April 24, 2018, that it would keep KOMO-TV, buy KZJO and sell KCPQ and KUNS-TV. KUNS-TV was to be sold to Howard Stirk Holdings, with Sinclair continuing to provide services to the station, while KCPQ was to be sold to Fox Television Stations, making KCPQ a Fox owned-and-operated station; with the cancellation of the deal, KCPQ and KZJO instead went to Nexstar Media Group in September 2019, only to be sold to Fox in March 2020.

On July 18, 2018, the FCC voted to have the Sinclair–Tribune acquisition reviewed by an administrative law judge amid &quot;serious concerns&quot; about Sinclair&#x27;s forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties. Three weeks later on August 9, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other mergers and acquisitions opportunities.

In September 2021, radio sister stations KOMO (1000 AM and 97.7 FM), KVI (570 AM), and KPLZ-FM (101.5) were sold to Lotus Communications, leaving KUNS-TV as the sole sister station to KOMO-TV in Seattle; KOMO-TV and KOMO radio were separated after 68 years with the sale. Sinclair retained full control over the KOMO call sign; on February 2, 2022, Lotus changed KOMO radio&#x27;s call sign to KNWN, though it continues to maintain a partnership with KOMO-TV, and the Lotus stations have not departed KOMO Plaza.

On September 1, 2023, the station&#x27;s second subchannel began to carry The CW temporarily, replacing KSTW, after CBS News and Stations exercised its option to withdraw its affiliations with the network after Nexstar acquired a majority stake. The subchannel continued to carry programming from Comet in all other time periods. On January 1, 2024, KUNS-TV discontinued its Univision affiliation (which moved to Bellingham-licensed KVOS-TV) and became the new affiliate of The CW for the Seattle market.

==Programming==
KOMO-TV and its Portland sister station KATU (also built by Fisher and signed-on in 1962) were the only two ABC stations in the contiguous United States which aired &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; on a one-hour delay, from the program&#x27;s start in 1970 until 1995, in order to accommodate early evening newscasts on both stations. When the Seattle Seahawks joined the NFL in 1976, the stations modified this arrangement in order to broadcast &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games involving the Seahawks live. In 1996, after years of fan protests, both KOMO-TV and KATU began clearing the entire &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; schedule live, regardless of the teams that were playing each week. A decade later, the program moved to cable on ESPN, though ABC began to simulcast select games with ESPN in 2020, along with NFL Wild Card playoff games starting in 2015. KOMO-TV aired the Seahawks&#x27; appearance in Super Bowl XL.

KOMO produces &quot;Seattle Refined&quot;, a lifestyle newsmagazine program that contains advertorial content.

===News operation===
KOMO-TV presently broadcasts 45 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday and five hours each on Saturdays and Sundays).

For the last three decades, KOMO has competed directly with KING-TV for first place in the Seattle news ratings. KOMO continually places first among the local newscasts in the market.

====Awards====
KOMO-TV&#x27;s news division has consistently won awards for its reporting, and averages more wins per year than any Seattle television station. The station won the Edward R. Murrow Award for &quot;Best Large Market Newscast&quot; In both 2002 and 2008. In June 2008, KOMO was awarded 15 regional Emmy Awards, taking top honors in the &quot;Station Excellence&quot;, &quot;Morning News&quot;, &quot;Evening News&quot;, &quot;Breaking News&quot; and &quot;Team Coverage&quot; categories. KOMO anchor/reporter Molly Shen won the prestigious Individual Achievement Award for the second time in three years, and longtime anchor Kathi Goertzen took home a Silver Circle Award, in recognition of her 25+ years with the station. The station also won the Emmy Award for &quot;Breaking News Coverage&quot;. A segment on The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies (Palm Springs, California) received an Emmy in 1997.

====Controversy====
In March 2019, KOMO-TV aired a news special entitled &quot;Seattle is Dying&quot;. This special documented the ongoing drug and homelessness crisis in Seattle and included interviews with residents, business owners, a former police chief, and several homeless people. The documentary and KOMO-TV were criticized by other media following the broadcast. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; contested the piece, publishing a rebuttal that April which countered that Seattle&#x27;s crime rates are actually significantly lower than the 1980s and 1990s. A subject of the documentary piece reported, when later interviewed, that he had been misrepresented.

====On-air staff====

KOMO anchors Dan Lewis, Kathi Goertzen, and weather forecaster Steve Pool had the third-longest tenure of an anchor team in the United States, having served as KOMO&#x27;s evening news team from 1987 to 2009. The station&#x27;s evening newscast has long been co-anchored by Lewis and Goertzen, and was praised by the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; as being the &quot;Best First-String anchor unit in town.&quot;

Following the presidential inauguration ceremony in 1993, Lewis became the first reporter to interview then-President Bill Clinton, which occurred at the White House.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KOMO-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 38, using virtual channel 4.

In 2009, KOMO-TV became one of four television stations in the country to be the first to launch mobile DTV signals. The Open Mobile Video Coalition chose KOMO and independent station KONG (channel 16), and WPXA-TV and WATL in Atlanta to beta test the ATSC-M/H standard, which has since been officially adopted for free-to-air digital broadcast television with clear reception on mobile devices, which overcomes the defects of the original ATSC standard.

==Canadian and out-of-market coverage==
KOMO-TV is available to most cable subscribers in the Vancouver–Victoria, British Columbia, area as the ABC affiliate and is one of five Seattle television stations seen in Canada on the Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct satellite services. It is also seen out-of-market on Charter Spectrum in Ellensburg (part of the Yakima DMA), with ABC programming and some syndicated shows blacked out due to the presence of local affiliate KAPP.

<text>Zvezda (), also known as the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module, is a module of the International Space Station (ISS). It was the third module launched to the station, and provided all of the station&#x27;s life support systems, some of which are supplemented in the US Orbital Segment (USOS), as well as living quarters for two crew members. It is the structural and functional center of the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS), which is the Russian part of the ISS. Crew assemble here to deal with emergencies on the station.

The module was manufactured in the USSR by Energia, with major sub-contracting work by GKNPTs Khrunichev. &quot;Zvezda&quot; was launched on a Proton launch vehicle on 12 July 2000, and docked with the &quot;Zarya&quot; module on 26 July 2000 at 01:45 UTC. It is a descendant of the &quot;Salyut&quot; programme&#x27;s DOS spacecraft, leading to the alternate name, DOS-8.

== Origins ==
The basic structural frame of &quot;Zvezda&quot;, known as &quot;DOS-8&quot;, was initially built in the mid-1980s to be the core of the &quot;Mir-2&quot; space station. This means that &quot;Zvezda&quot; is similar in layout to the core module (DOS-7) of the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. It was in fact labeled as &quot;Mir-2&quot; for quite some time in the factory. Its design lineage thus extends back to the original &quot;Salyut&quot; stations. The space frame was completed in February 1985 and major internal equipment was installed by October 1986.

The &quot;Mir-2&quot; space station was redesigned after the failure of the &quot;Polyus&quot; orbital weapons platform core module to reach orbit. &quot;Zvezda&quot; is around the size of &quot;Polyus&quot;, and has no armaments.

== Design ==
&quot;Zvezda&quot; consists of three pressurized compartments and one unpressurized compartment. From forward to aft, the pressurized compartments are: a spherical transfer compartment, a long cylindrical main working compartment, and a short cylindrical transfer tunnel. The unpressurized assembly compartment wraps around the exterior of the transfer tunnel. &quot;Zvezda&quot; weighs about and has a length of . The solar panels extend .

The transfer compartment () has three docking ports, along with a internal hatch that can seal it off from the rest of the module, allowing it to serve as an airlock. When &quot;Zvezda&quot; was launched, its forward port docked to the aft port of the &quot;Zarya&quot; module already in orbit. The nadir (Earth-facing) port was initially intended to be used by the Universal Docking Module, it would instead be used by the &quot;Pirs&quot; module from 2001 to 2021 and the &quot;Nauka&quot; module since 2021. The zenith (space-facing) port was initially intended to be used by the Science Power Platform, it would instead be used by the &quot;Poisk&quot; module since 2009. The transfer compartment&#x27;s airlock functionality was only used once during Expedition 2, when Yury Usachov and James Voss put a docking cone on the nadir port to prepare for the arrival of the &quot;Pirs&quot; module. 

The working compartment () is where the crews work and live and makes up the bulk of the module&#x27;s volume. It comprises two cylinders joined together by a conical adapter. The forward, small-diameter instrument compartment () contains the station command post (central computer) and related equipment, The aft large-diameter habitable compartment () contains two sleeping quarters, a NASA-provided Treadmill with Vibration Isolation Stabilization, a kitchen equipped with a refrigerator/freezer and a table, a bicycle for exercise, a toilet and other hygiene facilities, this section also contained the Elektron system that electrolyzes condensed humidity and waste water to provide up to per day of oxygen for breathing, while hydrogen is expelled into space. The system also creates condensed water that could be used for drinking in an emergency, but ordinarily fresh water from Earth was used.

&quot;Zvezda&quot; has 14 windows. There are two diameter windows, one in each of the two crew sleep compartments (windows No. 1 and 2), six diameter windows (No. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) on the forward Transfer Compartment earth-facing floor, a diameter window in the main Working Compartment (No. 9), and one diameter window in the aft transfer compartment (No. 10). There are a further three diameter windows in the forward end of the forward transfer compartment (No. 12, 13 and 14), for observing approaching craft. Window No. 11 is unaccounted for in all available sources.

&quot;Zvezda&quot; is also the home of the Lada Greenhouse, which is a test for growing plants in space.

The &quot;Assembly Compartment&quot; holds external equipment such as thrusters, thermometers, antennas, and propellant tanks. The large movable &quot;Lira satellite communications antenna&quot; is located on the Zvezda service module near the aft or rear of the International Space Station on this Assembly Compartment. The &quot;Transfer Chamber&quot; is equipped with automatic docking equipment and is used to service Soyuz and Progress spacecraft.

The Service Module has 16 small thrusters as well as two large S5.79 thrusters that are 2-axis mounted and can be gimballed 5°. The thrusters are pressure-fed from four tanks with a total capacity of 860 kg. The oxidizer used for the propulsion system is dinitrogen tetroxide and the fuel is UDMH, the supply tanks being pressurised with nitrogen. The two main engines on &quot;Zvezda&quot; can be used to raise the station&#x27;s altitude. This was done on 25 April 2007. This was the first time the engines had been fired since &quot;Zvezda&quot; arrived in 2000.

Elektron proved to be rather noisy for the crew and significant maintenance work, having failed several times and requiring the crew to use the Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator canisters (also called &quot;oxygen candles&quot;, which were the cause of a fire on &quot;Mir&quot;) when it has been broken for extended amounts of time. It also contains the Vozdukh, a system which removes carbon dioxide from the air based on the use of regenerable absorbers of carbon dioxide gas. 

The Zvezda module inherited a limitation from its predecessor Mir and Salyut stations rooted in a Soviet spacecraft design philosophy favoring the permanent installation of critical hardware. This approach, while providing more internal living space by concealing systems behind closed panels, contrasts with the US Orbital Segment&#x27;s (USOS) strategy of using easily replaceable International Standard Payload Racks. USOS modules, connected via the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM), have hatches that accommodate the movement of these racks between modules and spacecraft. Consequently, broken or unfixable hardware on Zvezda remains permanently in place. A notable example is the pre-installed Elektron oxygen-generating system, which required frequent repairs by cosmonauts due to the inability to replace it. Zvezda&#x27;s hatch and the lack of available replacement Elektron units hindered the replacement process. The discontinuation of Elektron production further exacerbated this issue. In October 2020, the Elektron system malfunctioned again, leading to its deactivation.

== Connection to the ISS ==
The rocket used for launch to the ISS carried advertising; it was emblazoned with the logo of Pizza Hut restaurants, for which they are reported to have paid more than US$1 million. The money helped support Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center and the Russian advertising agencies that orchestrated the event.

Management and integration of the Service Module into the International Space Station began in 1991. Structural construction was performed by RKK Energia, then handed over to the Khrunichev Design Bureau for final outfitting. Joint reviews between the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) and the NASA ISS Program Office monitored construction, solved language and security concerns and ensured flight readiness and crew training. Several years of delay were encountered due to funding constraints between Roscosmos and RKK Energia requiring repeated delays in First Element Launch.

On 26 July 2000, &quot;Zvezda&quot; became the third component of the ISS when it docked at the aft port of &quot;Zarya&quot;. (The U.S. &quot;Unity&quot; module had already been attached to &quot;Zarya&quot;). Later in July, the computers aboard &quot;Zarya&quot; handed over ISS commanding functions to computers on &quot;Zvezda&quot;.

On 11 September 2000, two members of the STS-106 Space Shuttle crew completed final connections between &quot;Zvezda&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot;; during a 6-hour, 14 minute EVA, astronaut Ed Lu and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko connected nine cables between &quot;Zvezda&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot;, including four power cables, four video and data cables and a fiber-optic telemetry cable. The next day, STS-106 crew members floated into &quot;Zvezda&quot; for the first time, at 05:20 UTC on 12 September 2000.

&quot;Zvezda&quot; provided early living quarters, a life support system, a communication system (&quot;Zvezda&quot; introduced a 10 Mbit/s Ethernet network to the ISS ), electrical power distribution, a data processing system, a flight control system, and a propulsion system. These quarters and some, but not all, systems have since been supplemented by additional ISS components.

== Launch risks ==
Due to Russian financial problems, &quot;Zvezda&quot; was launched with no backup and no insurance. Due to this risk, NASA had constructed an Interim Control Module (ICM) in case it was delayed significantly or destroyed on launch.

== Air leaks ==
Since September 2019, the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module has been experiencing a worsening air leak. The source appears to be microscopic structural cracks within the small transfer tunnel, known by the Russian acronym PrK, which connects &quot;Zvezda&quot; to the aft docking port typically used by Progress cargo spacecraft. Initially, the leak rate was minimal, less than per day, but it has steadily increased, reaching per day as of April 2024. While both NASA and Roscosmos suspect issues with welds, the exact cause of the leak remains unknown. NASA has classified the leaks as a high-risk threat to spaceflight activities, potentially leading to &quot;catastrophic failure.&quot; However, Roscosmos says that it does not believe a catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic, and has expressed confidence in their ability to monitor and manage the leak.

, to mitigate the leak and the risk of a catastrophic failure the normal operating procedure is to keep the hatch leading to the PrK from Zvezda closed except when a spacecraft is being actively accessed. When the hatch leading to the PrK is opened, a hatch leading to the US Orbital Segment of the ISS is closed, which would contain a catastrophic failure and decompression to just the Russian Orbital Segment.

<doc id="694516" wikidata="Q1021692" url="?curid=694516" title="Lampeia">
<text>Lampeia (Greek: Λάμπεια, before 1928: Δίβρη - &quot;Divri&quot;, between 1928 and 1929: Πρινόφυτον - &quot;Prinofyton&quot;) is a mountain village, a community and a former municipality in Elis, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Archaia Olympia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 72.447 km2. The community includes the village Amygdali.

Lampeia is situated south of Mount Erymanthos, in the valley of a tributary of the river Erymanthos. Its elevation is 802 m above sea level. The Greek National Road 33 (Patras - Tripoli) passes through it. Lampeia is 4 km west of Oreini, 9 km northeast of Koumanis, 28 km northeast of Olympia and 45 km south of Patras.

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Lampeia is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Astras (Astras, Kalyvia Astra)
*Lampeia (Lampeia, Amygdali)
*Oreini (Oreini, Paliofytia)

==Population==

==History==

The name &quot;Lampeia&quot; was taken from the mountain &quot;Lampeia&quot;, which is part of the Erymanthos range. According to Pausanias the river Erymanthos has its source on the mountain &quot;Lampeia&quot;, which is sacred to Pan. The area was part of Arcadia. Due to its inaccessibility, Lampeia saw few invaders. Also the Ottomans stayed in the lower areas for strategic reasons. The Zoodochos Pigi monastery in Lampeia was a centre of Greek culture and education. Several inhabitants fought in the Greek War of Independence, and some well known families of politicians (Petralias, Panagoulis, Stefanopoulos, Zafeiropoulos) came from Divri/Lampeia.

Lampeia was created as one of the eight municipalities of the Elis prefecture in the 1830s, and was disbanded in 1913. This municipality was larger than the present municipal unit, and included several villages now in adjacent municipal units (among others Koumanis, Antroni and Klindia). The municipality was recreated under the Capodistrian Plan in the late-1990s, and became a subdivision of the municipality of Archaia Olympia in 2011.

<doc id="694528" wikidata="Q3191412" url="?curid=694528" title="KING-TV">
<text>KING-TV (channel 5) is a television station in Seattle, Washington, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Tegna Inc. alongside Everett-licensed KONG (channel 16), an independent station. The two stations share studios at the Home Plate Center in the SoDo district of Seattle; KING-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in the city&#x27;s Queen Anne neighborhood.

Debuting as the first television station in the Pacific Northwest, channel 5 was purchased by and became the flagship station of Dorothy Bullitt&#x27;s King Broadcasting Company eight months into broadcasting; the company still exists as a license holder for its properties under Tegna ownership. The station became an NBC affiliate in 1959 and has generally led the Seattle television market since.

==History==
Channel 5 first took to the air as KRSC-TV on November 25, 1948, becoming the first television station in the Pacific Northwest (within six years, it became the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s first color broadcaster on July 1, 1954). The station was originally owned by Palmer K. Leberman&#x27;s Radio Sales Corporation, which also operated KRSC radio (1150 AM, now KKNW, and FM 98.1, now KING-FM); the original callsign was derived from Leberman&#x27;s company. The first broadcast on channel 5 was a live remote of a Thanksgiving Day high school football game – the telecast was plagued with technical difficulties, but local viewers reported being impressed nonetheless. Channel 5 was originally a primary CBS affiliate, and carried secondary affiliations with NBC, ABC and DuMont.

Eight months after the television station debuted, KRSC-TV and KRSC-FM were purchased by King Broadcasting Company, owners of KING radio (1090 AM, now KPTR) and the original KING-FM (94.9, frequency now occupied by KUOW-FM), for $375,000 in May 1949. The station changed its callsign to KING-TV to match its radio sisters (according to legend, King Broadcasting president Dorothy Bullitt purchased the KING call letters while on a fishing boat). For many years, the stations&#x27; logo was &quot;King Mike&quot;, an anthropomorphized microphone in ermine robes and a crown, drawn by cartoonist Walt Disney (its sister stations in Portland, Oregon, KGW-AM-FM-TV, used a similar logo, called &quot;Pioneer Mike&quot;; the King Mike logo was later brought back for KING&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1998 and still appears in promotional announcements to this day).

Once the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-imposed freeze on television station license awards ended in 1952, KING-TV lost its monopoly in the market. During 1953, the Seattle–Tacoma area received three new stations: KTNT-TV (channel 11, now KSTW) debuted in March as the market&#x27;s CBS outlet; while NBC went to KMO-TV (channel 13, now KCPQ), which signed on in August. NBC moved a few months later to KOMO-TV (channel 4), which went on the air in December. By the end of the year, KING-TV was left with poor-performing ABC and DuMont, the latter of which ceased operations in 1956. Subsequently, Bullitt lobbied NBC for a group affiliation for her stations, and in October 1958, KING-TV and KGW-TV in Portland began carrying NBC programming. In Seattle, channel 5 shared NBC and ABC with KOMO-TV for most of the 1958–59 television season. On September 27, 1959, KING-TV became an exclusive NBC station and KOMO-TV affiliated with ABC full-time. KING-TV is one of a few handful of stations in the country to have held a primary affiliation with all of the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks.

Dissatisfied with Stimson Bullitt&#x27;s management style, Dorothy Bullitt, and Mr. Bullitt&#x27;s sisters, arranged for his voluntary resignation from King Broadcasting in 1972. Stimson sold his company shares to his sisters, Harriet and Patsy. He then received control of the family&#x27;s real estate interests. Ancil Payne, who had served as general manager of the company&#x27;s Portland stations since 1965, became president and CEO. By the 1970s and 1980s, KING-TV was the flagship of a growing regional media empire which at various times included ventures in publishing, the film industry, cable television systems (under the name of King Videocable, the assets of which have by now been absorbed into Comcast) and even various timber assets in the Far East.

Locally produced programs that debuted on the station during the 1970s and 1980s included &quot;Seattle Today&quot;/&quot;Good Company&quot;, a mid-morning talk show hosted by Cliff Lenz and Shirley Hudson and later by Susan Michaels and Colby Chester; &quot;Seattle Tonight, Tonite!&quot;, hosted by Ross McGowan and later Dick Klinger; &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, originally a Sunday night talk and comedy show hosted by Ross Shafer, that later became an ensemble sketch comedy show (that eventually moved to Saturday nights) after Shafer left to become host of &quot;The Late Show&quot; on Fox; and a local &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; franchise, first hosted by Penny LeGate and Brian Tracey. Of these, only &quot;Evening Magazine&quot; (now entitled simply &quot;Evening&quot;) exists today. &quot;How Come?&quot;, a half-hour early Sunday evening family television program hosted by Al Wallace, won several awards during its run during the 1970s and early 1980s. The show covered topics on how things were made or done in the world. Dick Klinger hosted the show after Al Wallace died.

King Broadcasting&#x27;s stations included KGW radio and television in Portland, KREM-TV in Spokane, KTVB-TV in Boise, KHNL-TV and KFVE in Honolulu and KYA radio in San Francisco. Long-time station-owner Dorothy Bullitt died in June 1989. Dorothy Bullitt&#x27;s daughters Harriet Bullitt and Priscilla &quot;Patsy&quot; Bullitt Collins decided to sell the King assets in 1992—eventually selling King Broadcasting (including KING, KREM, KGW, KTVB, KHNL/KFVE and the cable provider assets) to The Providence Journal Company. KING-TV and other King Broadcasting stations later became Belo properties as a result of that company&#x27;s merger with The Providence Journal Company in 1997. As a result, Belo was forced to divest KIRO-TV to Cox Enterprises in order to keep the higher rated KING-TV.

Bonneville International Corporation purchased KING (AM) in 1994. During the 1990s, &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, as it became a pure comedy show, launched the careers of Bill Nye the Science Guy, Joel McHale (of &quot;The Soup&quot; fame) nationally and locally, Pat Cashman and John Keister (who replaced Ross Shafer as host of that show in 1988). KING-TV was also the home for &quot;Watch This!&quot;, a fast-paced Emmy Award-winning show aimed at children and teenagers; the show lasted five years and was hosted by local anchors, Jim Dever and Mimi Gan. On December 18, 1995, King Broadcasting launched Northwest Cable News (NWCN), which was a 24-hour regional cable news channel available primarily to cable providers in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho with lesser cable coverage in Alaska, Montana and California. &quot;Almost Live!&quot; ended after 15 years in 1999.

=== Gannett/Tegna, move to SoDo ===

On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo. The sale was completed on December 23. On June 29, 2015, Gannett&#x27;s newspaper business was spun out, with KING-TV and Gannett&#x27;s former TV properties renamed Tegna.

In April 2014, KING-TV announced plans to sell its South Lake Union headquarters and re-locate, taking advantage of a booming real estate market in the South Union Lake area. In September 2014, it was reported that the station was planning to lease multiple floors at the Home Plate Center, a complex in the SoDo area of Seattle, and located across the street from T-Mobile Park (formerly Safeco Field). In March 2015, Gannett confirmed that KING, KONG, and NWCN would move to the lower three floors of the Home Plate Center, and announced plans for KING-TV to utilize the lower floor for the market&#x27;s first street-side studio. The former facilities were sold to Kilroy Realty for nearly $50 million, and were demolished during the summer of 2016, and would be replaced by mixed-use developments.

The choice of a smaller location was in response to concerns that the large size of its previous facility inhibited collaboration. The ground floor contains two studios: a street-side studio for KING-TV&#x27;s news programming, and the other for local productions such as &quot;New Day Northwest&quot;. The newsroom is located on the second floor, and contained NWCN&#x27;s main set. The new facility was equipped with new Grass Valley master control, graphics, and playout hardware, and Sony automation equipment. After broadcasting its final newscast from the North Dexter Avenue studio on February 12, 2016, KING quietly transitioned its master control to Home Plate Center during that night&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, and began broadcasting newscasts from the new facility the following morning.

On January 6, 2017, NWCN was shut down due to declining viewership, the free online streaming of KING and KONG&#x27;s newscasts, and the reluctance of local cable systems to pay more for the channel to keep it operating.

==Programming==
KING-TV relies less on syndicated programming and more on the station&#x27;s newscasts and local programming. As of December 2023, KING-TV broadcasts only two syndicated programs during its weekday schedule, &quot;Extra&quot; and &quot;Inside Edition&quot;. Despite this, KING-TV was airing hours of syndicated programming prior to September 2013.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, KING-TV broadcasts coverage of the fireworks show on the Space Needle.

===Sports programming===
KING-TV opted not to carry NBC&#x27;s telecasts of the Stanley Cup Finals in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2013, when the games began at 5 p.m. Pacific time, choosing to instead air its regular lineup of local newscasts and syndicated shows. KONG picked up the NBC telecasts of the games, and CBC Television&#x27;s broadcasts of the games were available to most cable providers in the region through the network&#x27;s Vancouver owned-and-operated station CBUT. For the 2007 and 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, however, KING-TV aired NBC&#x27;s Saturday night telecasts, while KONG aired the other NBC telecasts. As for the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals, KING-TV aired games 1, 2 and 5 while KONG aired games 6 and 7.

KING-TV has been the official television partner of the Seattle Seahawks since 2022, airing preseason games and team-focused shows; previous stints with the team were held from 1981 to 2000 and again from 2004 to 2011 (sister station KONG carried Seahawks preseason games in 2003 and 2004). The station also airs Seahawks games through NBC&#x27;s broadcast contract with the NFL (via &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;; it has also served as the team&#x27;s unofficial home station, carrying most games from 1977 to 1997 when the team played in the AFC, which NBC held the broadcast rights to in those years). Notably, this included the Seahawks&#x27; appearance in Super Bowl XLIX. Both KING-TV and KONG served as official television broadcasters of the city&#x27;s Major League Soccer club Seattle Sounders FC from 2009 to 2013, in which KONG aired a weekly magazine program on Sunday nights during the season called &quot;Sounders FC Weekly&quot;, and was rebroadcast Mondays on sister cable channel Northwest Cable News.

KING-TV also broadcast all Seattle SuperSonics games covered through NBC&#x27;s NBA broadcast contract from 1990 to 2002, including the team&#x27;s 1996 NBA Finals appearance. It also aired select Seattle Mariners games via NBC&#x27;s MLB broadcast contract from 1977 to 1989, and for the postseason only from 1995 to 2000.

Beginning in the 2024–25 season, KING airs select Seattle Kraken NHL games as co-flagship of the Kraken Hockey Network, with the majority of regional games being carried by KONG. With the team&#x27;s move to the Big Ten Conference in the 2024 season, KING may also occasionally air Washington Huskies football games as part of NBC&#x27;s college football coverage.

===News operation===
KING-TV presently broadcasts 46 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, six hours on Saturdays and five hours on Sundays).

In 1999, to compete against KOMO-TV, KING-TV began broadcasting its newscasts in high definition; at the time it only had one HD-capable studio camera. In April 2007, KING-TV upgraded all of its studio cameras, graphics and weather system to high definition and began broadcasting its public affairs programming in HD as well. Field reports continued to be broadcast in standard definition (480i converted to 1080i HD for telecast) but were taped in a 16:9 aspect ratio, giving the appearance of high-definition. According to KING-TV, it is &quot;Seattle&#x27;s First HD Newscast&quot;.

Following its sale to the company, KING-TV adopted Gannett&#x27;s standardized newscast presentation (which used a color coding system modeled upon co-owned newspaper &quot;USA Today&quot;.

== Technical information ==
=== Subchannels ===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

On December 6, 2011, Belo signed an agreement with the Live Well Network to affiliate with digital subchannels of KING-TV and Spokane sister station KSKN; Live Well Network replaced Universal Sports on digital subchannel 5.2 on January 1, 2012, as Universal Sports transitioned into a cable and satellite channel during the first quarter of 2012. Justice Network replaced Live Well Network on 5.2 in January 2015.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KING-TV ended regular programming over its analog signal, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. As the &quot;analog nightlight&quot; station for the Seattle–Tacoma market, it aired a loop reminding viewers to get a digital converter box on analog channel 5 until June 26, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 48, using virtual channel 5.

==Canadian and out-of-market coverage==
KING-TV is one of five Seattle television stations that are available in Canada on satellite providers Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct, and is available to most cable subscribers in the Vancouver–Victoria, British Columbia, area as the NBC affiliate. The station is also carried on several cable providers in southeastern Alaska and northwestern Oregon, as well as in the Yakima DMA cities of Cle Elum and Ellensburg, with NBC programming and some syndicated shows blacked out due to FCC regulations. KING-TV is also carried in The Bahamas on REV TV.

<text>The Star (, translit. &quot;Zvezda&quot;) is a 2002 Russian film directed by Nikolai Lebedev, a large modern project of Mosfilm. It is based on a short story of the same name by Emmanuil Kazakevich, about a group of Soviet scouts working behind enemy lines during Operation Bagration in World War II. The story had previously been made into a 1953 film of the same name.

Aleksei Kravchenko won a government award for his role in this film.

==Plot==
A team of Soviet scouts is sent behind enemy lines to find the location of the German armor forces. The Soviets wait until night, and open up with an artillery barrage. As the guns fire, the team advances. The team successfully slips behind enemy lines. Many dramatic scenes follow. In one, a German soldier is captured and interrogated. In another, the team calls an airstrike on German positions, causing great damage and casualties. One man even kills a German soldier with his pistol during the air attack. This tract of scenes finds the main characters successfully finding the location of the German armor. They are eventually cornered in a barn, with Germans attacking on all sides. During the battle, the team leader sends a radio message, telling the location of enemy armor. The team is eventually overrun and wiped out.

<text>Pixlet is a video codec created by Apple and based on wavelets, designed to enable viewing of full-resolution, HD movies in real time at low DV data rates. According to Apple&#x27;s claims, it allows for a 20–25:1 compression ratio. Similar to DV, it does not use interframe compression, making it suitable for previewing in production and special effects studios. It is designed to be an editing codec; however, low bitrates make it poorly suited to broadcast use.

The name &quot;Pixlet&quot; is a contraction of &#x27;Pixar wavelet&#x27;. When it was introduced by Steve Jobs at Worldwide Developers Conference 2003, it was said that the codec was developed at the request of animation company Pixar.

A Power Macintosh with at least a 1 GHz PowerPC G4 processor is required for real-time playback of half-resolution high-definition video (960x540).

Pixlet, while part of the cross-platform QuickTime, is only available on Macs running Mac OS X v10.3 or later. QuickTime X cannot decode Pixlet files.

FFmpeg version 3.3 and later can decode Pixlet files. On March 21, 2019, Apple announced that Pixlet is among the codecs that will no longer be supported in its own software after the successor to macOS Mojave is released, due to the transition to 64-bit-only software. In the same announcement, Apple noted that third-party developers could maintain support by building support directly into their apps.

<text>Les Maîtres du temps ( &quot;The Masters of Time&quot;, &quot;Time Masters&quot;; &quot;Herrscher der Zeit&quot; in German; &quot;Az idő urai&quot; in Hungarian) is a 1982 independent animated science fiction film directed by René Laloux and designed by Mœbius. It is based on the 1958 science fiction novel &quot;L&#x27;Orphelin de Perdide&quot; (&quot;The Orphan of Perdide&quot;) by Stefan Wul.

The film centres on a boy, Piel, who is stranded on Perdide, a desert planet where giant killer hornets live. He awaits rescue by the space pilot Jaffar, the exiled prince Matton, his sister Belle and Jaffar&#x27;s old friend Silbad who are trying to reach Perdide and save Piel before it is too late.

== Plot ==
A man named Claude drives a vehicle across the planet Perdide. He sends a message to his friend Jaffar, telling him that his wife Annie was killed by indigenous monster hornets. After a crash wrecks his vehicle and he cannot extricate himself, Claude lets his son Piel down from the wreckage and hands him an interstellar transceiver, telling him that it is named &quot;Mike&quot; and will talk to him, and to do whatever Mike tells him to do. After Claude sends Piel to the Dolongs, a nearby forest which repulses the hornets, the vehicle explodes.

On his spaceship, Jaffar receives Claude&#x27;s last message. Before heading for Perdide, he decides to seek out his friend Silbad, who has experience in living on Perdide. Jaffar&#x27;s passengers, Prince Matton and his sister, Princess Belle, have been deposed from their planet; they bring with them a treasure the Prince took along to fund his restoration. Matton hates being diverted.

Jaffar, Silbad, Matton and Belle begin communicating with Piel to give him advice. On Silbad&#x27;s planet, they witness the metamorphosis of an organism into multiple empathic, sentient homunculi, two of whom, Yula and Jad, stow away on Jaffar&#x27;s spacecraft seeking adventure. Unbeknownst to everyone, Yula and Jad play with and then dispose of the treasure via the airlock. Matton nearly convinces Piel to drown himself in a lake, but is discovered by Belle. She stuns Matton and talks Piel to safety.

Jaffar plans to use the gravitational pull of the Blue Comet to reach Perdide. In order to rendezvous with it, Jaffar pilots his craft to the planet Gamma 10. Matton escapes in a shuttlecraft to the surface of Gamma 10, which is inhabited by identical angels. They capture both Matton and Jaffar, who followed in a space lifeboat, and intend to throw them into the amorphous being which controls the planet. Although they cannot rescue Jaffar, Yula and Jad forewarn him: As they contact the being, its victims get dominated by it, lose all sense of individuality and become angels. They instruct Jaffar and Matton to resist being assimilated by exuding all the hate and contempt they can muster. Matton leaps into the being and sacrifices himself, destroying the creature and causing the angels to revert to their original forms.

Rescued by Yula and Jad, the former captives are taken onboard Jaffar&#x27;s ship. Meanwhile, Piel befriends a local creature, a hyponiterix, which accompanies him. A patrol cruiser of the Interplanetary Reform catches up with Jaffar&#x27;s ship, pursuing the royals and the treasure Matton stole. Jaffar considers that the rescued spacefarers from Gamma 10 should hijack the Reform cruiser and take it for themselves. During the discussion of this plan, one of the rescued from Gamma 10, Onyx the Digeed of Gnaz, is revealed to be able to change his shape to resemble any object. Onyx will impersonate the missing treasure, allowing the escapees to access the Reformist ship.

Jaffar&#x27;s vessel is boarded, and as he presents the &quot;captured&quot; pirates and the fake treasure to the Reform commander, no one can converse with Piel, who begins to wander without supervision. Jaffar&#x27;s crew later attempt to contact Piel, who has lost his transceiver and the hyponiterix inside a cave filled with predatory tentacles. Despondent, Piel wanders back to the lakeside, which takes him out of the forest, and is attacked by the hornets which killed his parents. Jaffar&#x27;s ship closes on her destination, but the planet is being transported through time by a race of aliens known as the Masters of Time. Perdide and everything on it, including Piel, is sent back 60 years through time.

The effect of time travel renders the unprotected crew of Jaffar&#x27;s ship unconscious. They awake in a space-station, where they have been treated, but Silbad is dying. Yula and Jad telepathically discover that Silbad is actually a now-elderly Piel. At the time Perdide was displaced, Piel was nearly killed by the hornets before a passing spacefarer, who was investigating this recently appearing planet, came to his rescue. However, due to his trauma, Piel lost his childhood memories. Shortly after this revelation, Silbad dies. His funeral is attended by a Master of Time.

== Differences from the novel ==
The motion picture story is based on the novel &quot;L&#x27;Orphelin de Perdide&quot; (1958) by the French writer Stefan Wul.

In the original novel, the character of Piel was also named Claude, like his father. Laloux changed this to distinguish father and son.

<text>A meat grinder (also called a &quot;meat mincer&quot; in the UK) is a kitchen appliance for mincing (fine chopping) and/or mixing of raw or cooked meat, fish, vegetables or similar food. It replaces tools like the mincing knife (which are also used in the preparation of minced meat, filling, etc.). The food to be minced is placed into a funnel, which sits on top of the grinder. From there, the material enters a horizontal screw conveyor; the screw conveyor may be hand-cranked or powered by an electric motor. The screw squashes and mixes the food. At the end of the screw, the food is passed through a fixed plate, where it exits the machine. The fineness of the minced food depends on the size of the holes in the plate.

By changing the hole plate it is also possible to produce breadcrumbs or fill sausage casing. After the drop from the retainer, it is possible to change the hole plate. By removing the fixing screw the grinder can be disassembled completely for cleaning. Besides the domestic manually or motor operated grinders, there are also grinders for butchery (table- or shop-grinders for example) and for the food industry. Some large machines are able to produce several tons per hour.

==History==

The first meat grinder was invented in the nineteenth century by Karl Drais. The earliest form of the meat grinder was hand-cranked and forced meat into a metal plate that had several small holes, resulting in long, thin strands of meat.

Manufacturers developed powered machines as electricity became more accessible, and modern electric meat grinders can process several pounds of meat easily and uniformly. Some models have different attachments to add functionality, such as sausage-making, kibbe, and juicing, which have greatly broadened the way meat grinders are used.

==Mixer unit==

A basic optional feature for larger grinders is the mixer unit. With this unit different kinds of meat (for example beef or pork) can be mixed with each other homogeneously and/or the meat can be mixed with additives, like salt or spices, before grinding it.
Without such a mixer unit, the additives must be mixed into the meat after grinding it, which adversely affects the taste and appearance of most products. Salt is used especially to reduce the concentration of bacteria which preserves it for a longer time and gives a salty taste.

== Commercial vs. home use ==
Commercial meat grinders are used to process thousands of pounds of meat per hour. Frozen meat grinders can process frozen blocks of meat, down to –25 °C. The frozen blocks can range from 90×50×15 cm to 90×50×20 cm, and the force applied from to .

There are 2 different drive forms used in industrial meat grinders, a single-rev drive, which is ideal to grind frozen meat blocks using a single auger, and a two-rev drive, which pushes the product through a cutting knife using an auger and then through a perforated plate.

The frozen meat gets pushed by the auger into the star-shaped cutting blade. Once it has been cut, it gets pushed through a second cutting surface, the plate. The plate will further reduce the size of the product and will remove/break up any fat deposits. An example of a very common industrial meat grinder would be the Hobart 48/22 Meat Grinder.

<text>Tranz Rail, formally Tranz Rail Holdings Limited (New Zealand Rail Limited until 1995), was the main rail operator in New Zealand from 1991 until it was purchased by Toll Holdings in 2003.

==History==

The New Zealand railway network was initially built by provincial governments, starting with the Ferrymead Railway in 1863. From 1880, a central Government department, the New Zealand Railways Department, was responsible for operating most of the growing railway network. A few private lines were built, but only one, the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (W&amp;MR) achieved any measure of success. The W&amp;MR was nationalised in 1908. In 1931, due to increasing competition from road carriers, the Transport Licensing Act 1931 was passed, restricting road cartage and giving the railways department a monopoly on long-distance freight. In 1982, the same year the land transport sector was deregulated, the Railways Department was reconstituted as the New Zealand Railways Corporation, a statutory corporation (later a state-owned enterprise from 1986). The Railways Corporation restructured the operations of the railway network substantially during the 1980s, reducing staffing levels, closing workshops, and introducing a number of measures to increase productivity, such as removing guard&#x27;s vans, increasing train lengths and introducing new, heavier bulk bogie wagons.

=== Formation ===

The Fourth Labour Government passed the New Zealand Railways Corporation Restructuring Act 1990 on 28 August of that year. Two months later, on 28 October 1990, the New Zealand government removed core rail transport and shipping operations from the New Zealand Railways Corporation, creating a separate entity called New Zealand Rail Limited, a Crown Transferee company created under the Act. At the same time, the Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand was formed to protect heritage assets that New Zealand Rail planned to dispose of, especially heritage rolling stock, stations and other equipment.

The government wrote off NZ$1.08 billion in debt acquired by the company from the Railways Corporation (mainly for the electrification of the North Island Main Trunk, a Think Big project), and injected a further $300 million in capital. Fay, Richwhite and Company, financial advisers New Zealand Rail, argued the company had a better future with minimal debt.

Despite this capital injection, the company remained only marginally profitable, reporting after-tax profits of $36.2 million in 1992 and $18 million in 1993. The Railways Corporation retained ownership of the land beneath the railway tracks and yards, which New Zealand Rail paid $1 per year to lease.

New Zealand Rail re-branded, introducing a new logo similar to the Railways Corporation but with blue and yellow as colours instead of red and black, and a blue livery on locomotives, rolling stock and buildings.

===Privatisation===
The Bolger National government, elected following the defeat of the fourth Labour government in elections held in October 1990, privatised New Zealand Rail Limited in 1993. The New Zealand Treasury supported privatisation of the company, even though it stated Fay Richwhite had an unfair advantage over other bidders. Business journalist Brian Gaynor noted that New Zealand Rail was an attractive investment because of its strong balance sheet.

Six consortiums made bids to buy New Zealand Rail Limited:
* Freightways and the Noel Group: Freightways is a major New Zealand freight operator, Noel Group was a US-based investment company with investments in railways in the United States.
* Fay Richwhite and Wisconsin Central: consortium made up of Fay Richwhite (31.8% via the investment company Pacific Rail, later renamed Midavia Rail), the American railroad Wisconsin Central (27.3%), Berkshire Partners (27.3%), Alex van Heeren, the owner of Huka Lodge, 9.1% and Richwhite family interests, 4.5%.
* Sea Containers, Anschutz Corporation: Sea Containers was particularly interested in the ferry business, and the rail operations as well. Anschutz owned Southern Pacific and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande railways in the US (both later acquired by Union Pacific). 
* Mainfreight, Brierley Investments and Railroad Development Corporation: Mainfreight is a major NZ Rail customer, but Brierleys was seen as having an interest as it was a part shareholder of the Union Shipping Group. RDC was a minor owner of railroads in the US and Argentina. 
* Port of Tauranga and Port of Lyttelton, Pacifica Shipping, National Mutual and AMP Limited: At the time Port of Tauranga took 25% of rail freight, and Lyttelton was important for coal traffic. Pacifica saw the acquisition complementing its coastal shipping operation, and the insurance and investment firms were there for the later stock float.
* Ports of Auckland and Ports of Wellington, Sofrana-Unilines and Stagecoach: Mirroring Port of Tauranga for competition, Auckland saw the investment as strategic. Wellington saw NZ Rail as its biggest customer with the Interislander. Stagecoach was seen as wanting to complement its bus business in Wellington. Sofrana was a French shipping line.

The company was sold to the Fay Richwhite-Wisconsin Central consortium for $328.3 million through an entity named Pylorus Investments Limited, shortly afterwards renamed Tranz Rail Limited. The sale was completed on 30 September 1993. Tranz Rail Limited raised funds to buy New Zealand Rail by borrowing $223.3 million, and its shareholders contributed $105 million to the acquisition price through the purchase of 105 million Tranz Rail shares at $1 each.

In 1994 the company sold its 15% stake in Clear Communications for $72.6 million, $20.1 million above book value. The company had gained its shareholding by selling its fibre optic network along the North Island Main Trunk to Clear.

===Rebranded Tranz Rail===
New Zealand Rail carried its corporate brand until 18 October 1995, when Tranz Rail Limited was renamed Tranz Rail Holdings Limited and New Zealand Rail Limited was renamed Tranz Rail. On the same day Tranz Rail Holdings Limited made a $100 million capital repayment to the Fay Richwhite consortium, largely financed by the sale of shares in Clear Communications. The Tranz Rail brand was created by Wellington-based Cato Partners, who also designed brands for the divisions of Tranz Rail:

* CityRail, urban rail commuter services in Auckland and Wellington, were renamed Tranz Metro
* InterCity Rail, long-distance rail passenger services were renamed Tranz Scenic
* RailFreight, rail freight services were renamed Tranz Link

The livery that resulted was nicknamed Cato blue by rail fans.

==== Initial Public Offering ====
Tranz Rail listed on 14 June 1996 on the New Zealand Sharemarket and NASDAQ. 31 million new shares, equivalent to 25% of the company, were issued to the public at $6.19. At the time of the Initial Public Offering (IPO), Tranz Rail had term loans debt of $300 million.

The share price reached $9.00 in the middle of 1997 due to the enthusiasm at the time for rail to have a revitalised future however the ongoing and unsustainable rail infrastructure costs were what failed the company in the end despite aggressive efforts to maintain a sustainable business. The rail traffic and extensive network were simply not sustainable to maintain by a private company in the long term even through Wisconsin Central Transportation were heavily invested in the future of the company. Some of the original Tranz Rail shareholders took advantage of the high share price to sell down their shares in the company. Berkshire Fund sold most of its shares at more than $8 each between November 1996 and March 1997. In 1998, Alex van Heeren sold his holding for a profit of more than $42 million, and the next year Fay Richwhite sold 6.2 million shares at an average $3.67 a share. On 8 February 2002, Fay Richwhite sold 17.6 million shares at $3.60 a share and Berkshire Fund sold 4.3 million shares on 12 February that year at the same price. The original investors made a $360 million profit from their investment.

===TasRail investment===
In partnership with Wisconsin Central as the Australian Transport Network, Tranz Rail invested in Tasmanian rail operator Tasrail in 1997. From 1998, Tranz Rail sold twelve members of its DQ class and three QR class locomotives to Tasrail. The locomotives were rebuilt at the Hutt Workshops. The DQ locomotives were originally imported by New Zealand Rail in 1995 from Queensland Rail as an alternative to buying new locomotives. In service, they proved unpopular with locomotive crews, due to excessive vibration and noise in their cabs.

The investment provided only marginal returns, and Toll later sold the TasRail shareholding to Pacific National, a Toll Holdings partnership with Patrick Corporation, in 2003.

===Asset sales===

In December 1996, Tranz Rail sold the DFT class of locomotives to the Chicago Freight Car Leasing Company for $131.5 million. It then leased the locomotives back for a period of 12 years. The lease ended on 19 December 2008 with the locomotives ownership returning to Tranz Rail&#x27;s successor, KiwiRail.

Tranz Rail&#x27;s chairman Ed Burkhardt resigned in August 1999 as a result of resigning as the chairman, CEO and president of Wisconsin Central. Industry insiders put this down to his preference to re-invest revenues rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Wisconsin&#x27;s new board sold the company to the Canadian National Railway on 9 October 2001. Canadian National then put its 24% shareholding in Tranz Rail up for sale.

Tranz Rail also contracted out services which were previously provided in house. Alstom was contracted for locomotive servicing and took over the Hutt Workshops, while Transfield Services took over track maintenance.

In June 2001, Tranz Rail sold 50% of Tranz Scenic to two directors of the Victoria, Australia rail operator West Coast Railway for $33 million. This sale included long-distance passenger rolling stock and ten diesel locomotives of the DC class, reclassified as the DCP class, and two EF class electric locomotives. In 2004 this share was purchased by Toll NZ, as one of the West Coast Railway directors had died and the business was not performing adequately.

On 24 December 2001, Tranz Rail sold the Auckland suburban rail network to the New Zealand Government for $81 million. In 2003 a competitive tender was held to find a new operator for the suburban passenger services, which Tranz Rail did not bid for. Connex (later renamed Transdev Auckland) won the contract, and took over Tranz Metro&#x27;s Auckland operation from 23 August 2004.

===Intermodal Transformation Project===
Michael Beard became CEO of Tranz Rail in 2000 following the retirement of Dr Francis Small who had led the organisation from its SOE days into its first phase of privatisation. His policy was to focus on the rail freight operation, and sell any assets which were not core to this business, such as long-distance passenger trains (Tranz Scenic) and commuter services in Wellington and Auckland (Tranz Metro), partly because Tranz Rail was running out of cash to fund the rail network maintenance which it had spent over $900 million from 1993-2003. Beard also moved Tranz Rail&#x27;s headquarters from the Wellington railway station to a new purpose-built office on the North Shore of Auckland, at a cost of $16 million. In 2000 a ministerial inquiry was formed to look into Tranz Rail&#x27;s safety record, due to an unusually high number of work-related fatalities over the previous 12 months.

Beard introduced a &quot;mode neutral&quot; policy at the same time, as part of his &quot;Intermodal Transformation Project&quot;. The project emphasised containerised freight over &quot;marginal&quot; freight, which Tranz Rail stopped carrying by rail. This led to accusations that Tranz Rail was intentionally moving freight off rail and onto roads. One of the reasons cited by Tranz Rail for these policies was the cost of using road transport to the company was less than that of using rail, because the road infrastructure is provided as a public good, whereas the rail network was a private good.

====Roger Award====
Tranz Rail won the Roger Award for The Worst Transnational Corporation operating in New Zealand on three occasions: 2000, 2001 and 2002, and was the first corporation inducted into the &quot;hall of shame&quot;. The Awards came amidst critical reports of lax safety standards, inadequate maintenance, asset stripping and insider trading.

===Takeover===
In May 2002, Tranz Rail was delisted from the NASDAQ, as 70% of its shares were owned by New Zealanders and 16% Australians.

In May 2003, United States based RailAmerica made a takeover offer of 75c per share for Tranz Rail. The offer was later withdrawn when the share price dropped below 50c. In June 2003, the Government announced that it would buy back the rail network for $1 and purchase a 35% stake in the firm for $76 million (67c per share), which would have given it effective control of the company. The Government would have had the right to nominate three of the seven directors on the board. This met with approval from the Rail &amp; Maritime Transport Union (RMTU) which had run a vigorous &quot;Take Back The Track&quot; campaign for the government to renationalise the railway network. The Rail Freight Action Group, which represents the interests of some of the biggest rail freight using companies, declared its support. Tranz Scenic, by then a separate company from Tranz Rail, did likewise.

====Toll Holdings offer====

In May 2003, the Australian transport firm Toll Holdings purchased a 6.1% share of Tranz Rail, increasing its share to 10.1% by June and 19.9% in July. Toll then launched its own takeover bid, initially offering 75c per share, later increased to 95c.

In July 2003, the Government announced that it was dropping its bid to buy a 35% stake in Tranz Rail, instead allowing Toll to succeed in its takeover bid. Toll&#x27;s bid valued Tranz Rail at $231 million. The Government reached a Heads of Agreement with Toll later that month, and eventually bought the rail network for $1, plus $50 million for property assets including leases and Wellington railway station. The deal also established a performance regime creating incentives for Toll if it shifts freight from road to rail, and penalties if freight carriage falls below 70% of current levels. If Toll increases freight volumes by 10% or more on certain lines the Government will grant it a track access charge holiday. The parties agreed the Government would spend $200 million over the next five years upgrading the track via the New Zealand Railways Corporation, operating as ONTRACK.

Toll did not achieve the 90% stake of Tranz Rail it required to meet the Government&#x27;s deal and compulsorily acquire the remaining 10% of shares, despite raising its offer again to $1.10 per share. In 2003, around 3,000 small shareholders held 25% of Tranz Rail&#x27;s shares, many of them major institutional shareholders such as AMI and Infratil. After a number of extensions of the deadline set by Toll, it held 84.2% of shares in Tranz Rail after the offer closed in December 2003. By that time, shares were being sold on the New Zealand Sharemarket for $1.65, above even the independent valuation of between $1.34 and $1.62 made in July by merchant bankers Grant Samuel. Despite Toll not achieving the 90% requirement, the Government honoured the Heads of Agreement made in July.

In February 2004, Tranz Rail reported a $346 million loss for the half-year ended December 2003. In the same year, it carried 2.1 million tonnes of coal on the Midland line in the South Island. The departure of the former chief executive officer, Michael Beard, and six other top managers cost it $6 million in exit payments.

The company was renamed Toll NZ and did not retain any of the Tranz Rail directors. In May 2008, the New Zealand Government agreed to buy the rail and sea transport assets of Toll NZ Limited for $665 million. The government branded the new company KiwiRail.

==Performance==

The total number of tonnes transported by New Zealand Rail and Tranz Rail from 1995 increased between 1993 and 2003, peaking in 2000.

Rail freight volumes 19932003 (year ending 30 June):
==Securities Commission investigation==
In late 2004, the New Zealand Securities Commission launched an investigation into the company regarding alleged insider trading. In June 2007 David Richwhite (along with his shell company Midavia Rail, formerly Pacific Rail) agreed to pay NZ$20 million, but did not admit liability.

<doc id="694567" wikidata="Q1039367" url="?curid=694567" title="Carl Laemmle Jr.">
<text>Carl Laemmle Jr. (born Julius Laemmle; April 28, 1908 – September 24, 1979) was an American film producer, studio executive and heir of Carl Laemmle, who had founded Universal Studios. He was head of production at the studio from 1928 to 1936.

==Early life==

Laemmle was born on April 28, 1908, in Chicago, the son of Carl Laemmle, the founder of Universal Pictures, and Recha Stern Laemmle, who died in 1919 when he was eleven years old. Carl Jr. had a sister Rosabelle, and a cousin Carla, an actress and dancer. His mother was buried in Salem Fields Cemetery, Glendale, New York. His family was Jewish, and during the 1930s Carl Laemmle Sr. assisted Jewish people in leaving Germany.

The Laemmle family shared a large New York City apartment located at 465 West End Avenue before moving to Los Angeles, California. 

==Career==

During his tenure as head of production, beginning in 1928 in the early years of talkie movies, the studio had great success with films such as &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930), &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1931), &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;East of Borneo&quot; (1931), &quot;A House Divided&quot; (1931), &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1932), &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932), &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933), &quot;Imitation of Life&quot; (1934), and &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935).

Laemmle (often referred to as &quot;Junior&quot;) developed a reputation during this period for spending too much money on films that did not earn back their cost. By the end of 1935, Universal Studio had spent so much money, and had so many flops, that J. Cheever Cowdin offered to buy the Laemmles out. The notable success, both financially and critically, of the 1936 film &quot;Show Boat&quot;, was not enough to stem the downslide, and father and son were both forced out of the company. Neither worked on another film again, although Laemmle Jr. lived for 43 more years. Charles R. Rogers became the new head of production at the studio.

==Personal life==
Laemmle resided at 1641 Tower Grove Drive in Beverly Hills, California. He died from a stroke at the age of 71 on September 24, 1979, 40 years to the day of his father&#x27;s death. He was buried in the Chapel Mausoleum at Home of Peace Cemetery.

<text>Andrew David Jenkinson, known professionally as Ceephax Acid Crew, is a British electronic musician and record producer who works primarily in the acid house and drum and bass subgenres. Jenkinson is also known simply by the pseudonym Ceephax, which is a reference to the BBC teletext service Ceefax. He is the younger brother of Squarepusher (Tom Jenkinson).

==Music and career==

Jenkinson became interested in music at 12 years old when he would go into his brother&#x27;s room and play his brother&#x27;s SH-101. He started a rock band called &quot;C-Fax&quot;, and kept the name for his later performances.

Ceephax&#x27;s music from 1997 to 2002 and beyond used mainly vintage (especially Roland) drum machines and synthesizers such as the TB-303. This music was often recorded onto a cassette tape deck. The music was released on vinyl records and cassette tape on underground record labels, such as Breakin&#x27; Records, Lo Recordings, and Firstcask. This primitive acid house aesthetic and methodology countered the growing popularity of the computer music and compact disc releases of the time. Rephlex Records and Warp Records also released Jenkinson&#x27;s remixes of Squarepusher around this time.

From 2003 onwards, alongside his more typical acid style, he has also released drum and bass songs made on old samplers, an Amiga, and various early digital synthesizers. His set on Mary Anne Hobbs&#x27; show Breezeblock in 2003, and more tracks such as &quot;Castilian&quot; and &quot;Arcadian&quot; also indicate an interest in chiptune music.

From 2007 onwards, he has had full releases on the record labels Rephlex and Planet Mu. He also continues to release on Firstcask and other independent labels such as WéMè, Bugklinik, and his own label, Waltzer.
Ceephax&#x27;s live shows are set apart from the popular laptop style of live electronic performance by exclusively using only analogue and early digital equipment and occasionally an Amiga computer. Frequently used hardware includes TB-303, TR-909, TR-707, SH-101, Kenton Pro-2000, and Yamaha RS7000. These sets range from house, acid house, techno, drum and bass, and gabber. He has also produced several music videos, predominantly using old video equipment and early computer animation software.

<doc id="694572" wikidata="Q2133790" url="?curid=694572" title="Rawlins Lowndes">
<text>Rawlins Lowndes (January 6, 1721August 24, 1800) was an American lawyer, planter and politician who became involved in the patriot cause after his election to South Carolina&#x27;s legislature, although he opposed independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. Lowndes served as president/governor of South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War, and after the war opposed his state&#x27;s ratification of the Constitution of the United States because it would restrict the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Lowndes also served as a state legislator and mayor of Charleston before his death. Two of his sons, Thomas and William Lowndes, would serve in the U.S. Congress.

==Early and family life==
Lowndes was born on the island of St. Kitts in the British West Indies in January 1721, the third son of British merchant Charles Lowndes and his wife, the former Ruth Rawlins (from a locally important family). His father resigned from the St. Kitts legislature in 1731 and moved his young family and slaves to Charleston, South Carolina. However, he committed suicide five years later, distraught over failed investments. His eldest son, William Lowndes, returned to St. Kitts with his widowed mother, married in 1739 and became a local legislator like many maternal relatives. His younger sons remained in South Carolina and were placed in the care of the provost marshal (local sheriff), Robert Hall. The elder, Charles Lowndes, was then 17, and after finishing his education under Hall&#x27;s direction, became a planter in Colleton County, South Carolina. He would also marry and serve briefly as its provost marshal (after his younger brother Rawlins as discussed below) before his death in 1763. Hall trained Rawlins as a lawyer, and when the provost marshal died in 1740 the local bar recommended that only a temporary successor be named, in order that Rawlins Lowndes could become Hall&#x27;s permanent successor as provost marshal when he reached legal age two years later, noting that in 1725 the post had been granted by the proprietors of Carolina to his uncle Thomas Lowndes of Westminster, his heirs and assigns, and that when the Crown succeeded to the proprietors&#x27; rights, that grant was renewed, although Thomas Lowndes never left England but assigned it to others.

==Career==
Upon reaching the legal age of 21, Lowndes was appointed as the Provost-Marshal of South Carolina. He served in this role for ten years, from 1742 to 1752. His success as a lawyer, and through favorable marriages discussed below, led him to acquire large plantations on the Ashley, Combahee and Santee Rivers, which he farmed using enslaved labor.

Upon resigning as provost-marshal Lowndes won election to the Royal Assembly, the colonial legislature, and rose to become its Speaker, as well as &quot;justice of the quorum&quot;, in which capacity he ordered a printer freed who had been imprisoned on order of the governor and council. However, Lowndes resigned his legislative position upon receiving a royal appointment as associate justice for the colony in 1766. In that position, he declared the Stamp Act unlawful, against common rights and thus unenforceable before his court. This displeased the colony&#x27;s chief judge, Gordon, who brought charges against Lowndes before the governor and council, but Lowndes was acquitted unanimously. Nonetheless, upon receiving a letter from Attorney General Simpson (who shortly thereafter returned to England), the governor removed Lowndes from his judicial office in early 1775. Nonetheless, when Judge Gordeon was shortly thereafter reassigned to Jamaica, Lowndes received an appointment as South Carolina&#x27;s Chief Justice.

During his years as a South Carolina political leader, Lowndes became a guiding force in South Carolina’s revolutionary government. In June 1775, the Provincial Congresses appointed Lowndes to the Committee of Safety together with Henry Laurens, Charles Pinckney and ten other men. In September, 1775, the last royal governor Lord William Campbell, fled to a warship in the harbor after refusing to recognize the provincial Congress, which declared the colony&#x27;s independence 6 months later, in March 1776. By that time, John Rutledge was president of the senate, and Lowndes became a member of the legislative council.

Lowndes became a member of the First and Second Provincial Congresses, the First and Second General Assemblies, and South Carolina&#x27;s First and Second Committee of Safety. In 1776, Lowndes was one of eleven committee members charged with the responsibility of writing a draft constitution for South Carolina.

Despite his involvement in challenging increasingly harsh British measures leading up to the American Revolution, Lowndes opposed armed rebellion and independence from Britain.

On March 7, 1778 South Carolina General Assembly elected Lowndes President of South Carolina. He succeeded John Rutledge (and would also be succeeded by Rutledge). Lowndes approved major changes to the state constitution on March 19, 1778, despite Rutledge&#x27;s prior veto. The first changed the title of South Carolina’s chief executive from &quot;president&quot; to &quot;governor&quot;. Other major changes removed the governor’s power to veto legislation, created a Senate elected via popular election, and disestablished the Church of England in South Carolina. By this time, the conflict had reached South Carolina (and Lowndes&#x27; plantations had been raided, once causing him to yoke oxen to his carriage, all his horses having been carried off). Lowndes cooperated with General Benjamin Lincoln and also ordered a general embargo of the former colony&#x27;s ports, forbidding any vessels from leaving.

After serving as President of South Carolina, Lowndes was elected to the South Carolina Senate from St. Bartholomew&#x27;s parish (which he had previously represented in the lower house), then won election and re-election to the House of Representatives in 1787 representing Charleston (St. Philip&#x27;s and St. Michael&#x27;s parishes) until 1790, when he decided against running for re-election after the capital was moved to Columbia. As assemblyman in 1788, Lowndes strenuously opposed the motion to accept the federal Constitution. He spoke four times in the 3-day debate, particularly opposing the clauses giving Congress power to regulate commerce, restricting the trans-Atlantic slave trade after 1808; and to the centralization of power which would accrue to the federal government. However, he refused to stand for election to the state&#x27;s convention debating the federal Constitution, which was adopted by a 140 vote to 73 vote margin.
During the same period, Lowndes became intendant (mayor) of Charleston, from September 1788 to September 1789.

==Personal life==

Rawlins Lowndes himself married three times. His first marriage, on August 15, 1748, was to Amarinthia Elliott, daughter of Thomas Elliot of Rantoules plantation on the Stono River, but she died in January 1750. Lowndes next married Mary Cartwight of Charleston on December 23, 1751, and they had ten children, several of which died as children. His sons Thomas (b. 1766) and William (b. 1782) would both follow their father&#x27;s careers as lawyers, legislators and planters. Three daughters lived to marry and two had children: Amarintha Lowndes Sanders Champney, Harriett Lowndes Brown and Sarah-Ruth Lowndes Brown. Rawlins Lowndes&#x27; final marriage was to Sarah Jones, the mother of William Jones Lowndes; the widow only survived her husband by months, dying in a carriage accident while riding with her son, who survived.

==Death and legacy==

Lowndes died in Charleston, South Carolina, on August 24, 1800.

<doc id="694597" wikidata="Q271847" url="?curid=694597" title="Thích Quảng Đức">
<text>Thích Quảng Đức (, ; born Lâm Văn Túc; – 11 June 1963) was a Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhist monk who died by self-immolation at a busy Saigon road intersection on 11 June 1963. Quảng Đức was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government of Ngô Đình Diệm, a staunch Roman Catholic. Photographs of his self-immolation circulated around the world, drawing attention to the policies of the Diệm government. John F. Kennedy said of one photograph, &quot;No news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one&quot;. Malcolm Browne won the World Press Photo of the Year for his photograph of the monk&#x27;s death.

Quảng Đức&#x27;s act increased international pressure on Diệm and led him to announce reforms with the intention of mollifying the Buddhists. However, the promised reforms were not implemented, leading to a deterioration in the dispute. As protests continued, the ARVN Special Forces loyal to Diệm&#x27;s brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, launched raids across South Vietnam on Buddhist pagodas, seizing Quảng Đức&#x27;s heart and causing deaths and widespread damage. Several Buddhist monks followed Quảng Đức&#x27;s example, also immolating themselves. Eventually, a US-backed coup toppled Diệm, who was assassinated on 2 November 1963.

==Biography==
Accounts of the life of Quảng Đức are derived from information disseminated by Buddhist organizations. He was born in the village of Hội Khánh, in Vạn Ninh District of Khánh Hòa Province in central Vietnam as Lâm Văn Túc, one of seven children of Lâm Hữu Ứng and his wife, Nguyễn Thị Nương. At the age of seven, he left to study Buddhism under Hòa thượng Thích Hoằng Thâm, who was his maternal uncle and spiritual master. Thích Hoằng Thâm raised him as a son and Lâm Văn Túc changed his name to Nguyễn Văn Khiết. At age 15, he took the samanera (novice) vows and was ordained as a monk at age 20 under the dharma name Thích Quảng Đức. The Vietnamese name &quot;Thích&quot; () is from &quot;Thích Ca&quot; or &quot;Thích Già&quot; (), means &quot;of the Shakya clan.&quot; After ordination, he traveled to a mountain near Ninh Hòa, vowing to live the life of a solitary Buddhism-practicing hermit for three years. He returned in later life to open the Thien Loc pagoda at his mountain retreat.

After his self-imposed isolation ended, he began to travel around central Vietnam expounding the dharma. After two years, he went into retreat at the Sac Tu Thien An pagoda near Nha Trang. In 1932, he was appointed an inspector for the Buddhist Association in Ninh Hòa before becoming the inspector of monks in his home province of Khánh Hòa. During this period in central Vietnam, he was responsible for the construction of 14 temples. In 1934, he moved to southern Vietnam and traveled throughout the provinces spreading Buddhist teachings. During his time in southern Vietnam, he also spent two years in Cambodia studying the Theravada Buddhist tradition.

Upon his return from Cambodia, he oversaw the construction of a further 17 new temples during his time in the south. The last of the 31 new temples that he was responsible for constructing was the Quan The Am pagoda in the Phú Nhuận District of Gia Định Province on the outskirts of Saigon. The street on which the temple stands was later renamed Quảng Đức Street in 1975. After the temple-building phase, Quảng Đức was appointed to serve as the Chairman of the Panel on Ceremonial Rites of the Congregation of Vietnamese Monks, and as abbot of the Phuoc Hoa pagoda, which was the initial location of the Association for Buddhist Studies of Vietnam (ABSV). When the office of the ABSV was relocated to the Xá Lợi Pagoda, the main pagoda of Saigon, Quảng Đức resigned.

==Self-immolation==

===Religious background===
In a country where surveys of the religious composition at the time estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70 and 90 percent, President Diệm was a member of the Catholic minority, and pursued discriminatory policies favoring Catholics for public service and military promotions, as well as in the allocation of land, business arrangements and tax concessions. Diệm once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting that the officer was from a Buddhist family, &quot;Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted&quot;. Many officers in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) converted to Roman Catholicism as their military prospects depended on it. Additionally, the distribution of firearms to village self-defense militias saw weapons given only to Roman Catholics, with some Buddhists in the army being denied promotion if they refused to convert to Roman Catholicism.

Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies; there were forced conversions, looting, shelling, and demolition of pagodas in some areas, to which the government turned a blind eye. Some Buddhist villages converted &quot;en masse&quot; to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Diệm&#x27;s regime. The &quot;private&quot; status that was imposed on Buddhism by the French, which required official permission to be obtained by those wishing to conduct public Buddhist activities, was not repealed by Diệm. Catholics were also &quot;de facto&quot; exempt from corvée labor, which the government obliged all citizens to perform, and United States aid was distributed disproportionately to Catholic majority villages by Diệm&#x27;s regime.

The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country and enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and land owned by the Catholic Church was exempt from land reform. The white and gold Vatican flag was regularly flown at all major public events in South Vietnam, and Diệm dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary in 1959.

Buddhist discontent erupted following a ban in early May on flying the Buddhist flag in Huế on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had been encouraged to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of Huế, Diệm&#x27;s elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Diệm&#x27;s refusal to take responsibility—he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths—led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diệm remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency of protests increased.

===Day of the act===

On 10 June 1963, US correspondents were informed that &quot;something important&quot; would happen the following morning on the road outside the Cambodian embassy in Saigon. Most of the reporters disregarded the message, since the Buddhist crisis had at that point been going on for more than a month, and the next day only a few journalists turned up, including David Halberstam of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Malcolm Browne, the Saigon bureau chief for the Associated Press (AP). Quảng Đức arrived as part of a procession that had begun at a nearby pagoda. Around 350 monks and nuns marched in two phalanxes, preceded by an Austin Westminster sedan, carrying banners printed in both English and Vietnamese. They denounced the Diệm government and its policy towards Buddhists, demanding that it fulfill its promises of religious equality. Another monk offered himself, but Quảng Đức&#x27;s seniority prevailed.

The act occurred at the intersection of Phan Đình Phùng Boulevard (now Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Street) and Lê Văn Duyệt Street (now Cách Mạng Tháng Tám Street), a few blocks southwest of the Presidential Palace (now the Reunification Palace). Quảng Đức emerged from the car along with two other monks. One placed a cushion on the road while the second opened the trunk and took out a five-gallon petrol can. As the marchers formed a circle around him, Quảng Đức sat down in the traditional Buddhist meditative lotus position on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over Quảng Đức&#x27;s head. Quảng Đức rotated a string of wooden prayer beads and recited the words &quot;&quot; (&quot;Homage to Amitābha Buddha&quot;) before striking a match and dropping it on himself. Flames consumed his robes and flesh, and black oily smoke emanated from his burning body.

Quảng Đức&#x27;s last words before his self-immolation were documented in a letter he had left: 

David Halberstam wrote: 

The spectators were mostly stunned into silence, but some wailed and several began praying. Many of the monks and nuns, as well as some shocked passersby, prostrated themselves before the burning monk. Even some of the policemen, who had orders to control the gathered crowd, prostrated before him.

In English and Vietnamese, a monk repeated into a microphone: &quot;A Buddhist priest burns himself to death. A Buddhist priest becomes a martyr.&quot; After approximately 10 minutes, Quảng Đức&#x27;s body was fully immolated and it eventually toppled backwards onto its back. Once the fire subsided, a group of monks covered the smoking corpse with yellow robes, picked it up and tried to fit it into a coffin, but the limbs could not be straightened and one of the arms protruded from the wooden box as he was carried to the nearby Xá Lợi Pagoda in central Saigon. Outside the pagoda, students unfurled bilingual banners that read: &quot;A Buddhist priest burns himself for our five requests.&quot;

By 1:30p.m. around 1,000 monks had congregated inside to hold a meeting, while outside a large crowd of pro-Buddhist students had formed a human barrier around it. The meeting soon ended and all but 100 monks slowly left the compound. Nearly 1,000 monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00p.m. thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers the impression that an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.

===Funeral and aftermath===
After the self-immolation, the US put more pressure on Diệm to re-open negotiations on the faltering agreement. Diệm had scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:30a.m. on 11June to discuss the Buddhist crisis which he had believed to be winding down. Following Quảng Đức&#x27;s death, Diệm canceled the meeting and met individually with his ministers. Acting US Ambassador to South Vietnam William Trueheart warned Nguyễn Đình Thuận, Diệm&#x27;s Secretary of State, of the desperate need for an agreement, saying that the situation was &quot;dangerously near breaking point&quot; and expected Diệm would meet the Buddhists&#x27; five-point manifesto. United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk warned the Saigon embassy that the White House would publicly announce that it would no longer &quot;associate itself&quot; with the regime if this did not occur. The Joint Communiqué and concessions to the Buddhists were signed on 16 June.

The funeral was set for 15 June. On that day 4,000 people gathered outside the Xá Lợi pagoda, only for the ceremony to be postponed. On 19 June, his remains were carried out of Xá Lợi to a cemetery south of the city for a re-cremation and funeral ceremony. Following the signing of the Joint Communiqué, attendance was limited by agreement between Buddhist leaders and police to approximately 500 monks.

===Intact heart and symbolism===

Quảng Đức&#x27;s body was re-cremated during the funeral, but his heart supposedly remained intact and did not burn. It was considered to be holy and placed in a glass chalice at Xá Lợi Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion. Quảng Đức has subsequently been revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a &quot;bodhisattva&quot; (&quot;Bồ Tát&quot;), and accordingly is often referred to in Vietnamese as Bồ Tát Thích Quảng Đức. On 21 August, the ARVN Special Forces of Nhu attacked Xá Lợi and other Buddhist pagodas across Vietnam. The secret police intended to confiscate Quảng Đức&#x27;s ashes, but two monks had escaped with the urn, jumping over the back fence and finding safety at the US Operations Mission next door. 

The location chosen for the self-immolation, in front of the Cambodian embassy, raised questions as to whether it was coincidence or a symbolic choice. Trueheart and embassy official Charles Flowerree felt that the location was selected to show solidarity with the Cambodian government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. South Vietnam and Cambodia had strained relations: in a speech on 22 May, Sihanouk had accused Diệm of mistreating Vietnamese and ethnic minority Khmer Buddhists. The pro-Diệm &quot;Times of Vietnam&quot; published an article on 9 June which claimed that Cambodian monks had been encouraging the Buddhist crisis, asserting it was part of a Cambodian plot to extend its neutralist foreign policy into South Vietnam. Flowerree noted that Diệm was &quot;ready and eager to see a fine Cambodian hand in all the organized Buddhist actions&quot;.

===Diệm reaction===

Diệm made a radio address at 19:00 on the day of Quảng Đức&#x27;s death, asserting that he was profoundly troubled by the event. He appealed for &quot;serenity and patriotism&quot;, and announced that stalled negotiations would resume with the Buddhists. He claimed that negotiations had been progressing well and in a time of religious tension emphasized the role of the Roman Catholic philosophy of personalism in his rule. He alleged that extremists had twisted the facts and he asserted that the Buddhists can &quot;count on the Constitution, in other words, me&quot;.

The ARVN responded to the appeal, putting on a show of solidarity behind Diệm to isolate dissident officers. Thirty high-ranking officers headed by General Lê Văn Tỵ declared their resolve to carry out all missions entrusted to the army for the defense of the constitution and the Republic. The declaration was a veneer which masked a developing plot to oust Diệm. Some of the signatories were to become personally involved in Diệm&#x27;s overthrow and death in November. Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn, the presidential military advisor and the chief of the army who were to lead the coup, were overseas.

Madame Nhu (a Catholic convert and the wife of Diệm&#x27;s younger brother and chief adviser Ngô Đình Nhu), who was regarded as the First Lady of South Vietnam at the time (as Diệm was a bachelor), said she would &quot;clap hands at seeing another monk barbecue show&quot;. Later that month, Diệm&#x27;s government charged that Quảng Đức had been drugged before being forced to die by suicide. The regime also accused Browne of bribing Quảng Đức to burn himself.

===Political and media impact===
Photographs taken by Malcolm Browne of the self-immolation quickly spread across the wire services and were featured on the front pages of newspapers worldwide. The self-immolation was later regarded as a turning point in the Buddhist crisis and a critical point in the collapse of the Diệm regime.

Historian Seth Jacobs asserted that Quảng Đức had &quot;reduced America&#x27;s Diệm experiment to ashes as well&quot; and that &quot;no amount of pleading could retrieve Diệm&#x27;s reputation&quot; once Browne&#x27;s images had become ingrained into the psyche of the world public. Ellen Hammer described the event as having &quot;evoked dark images of persecution and horror corresponding to a profoundly Asian reality that passed the understanding of Westerners.&quot; John Mecklin, an official from the US embassy, noted that the photograph &quot;had a shock effect of incalculable value to the Buddhist cause, becoming a symbol of the state of things in Vietnam.&quot; William Colby, then chief of the CIA&#x27;s Far East Division, opined that Diệm &quot;handled the Buddhist crisis fairly badly and allowed it to grow. But I really don&#x27;t think there was much they could have done about it once that bonze burned himself.&quot;
President John F. Kennedy, whose government was the main sponsor of Diệm&#x27;s regime, learned of Quảng Đức&#x27;s death when handed the morning newspapers while he was talking to his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, on the phone. Kennedy reportedly interrupted their conversation about segregation in Alabama by exclaiming &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; He later remarked that &quot;no news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one&quot;. US Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, claimed that &quot;such grisly scenes have not been witnessed since the Christian martyrs marched hand in hand into the Roman arenas.&quot;

In Europe, the photographs were sold on the streets as postcards during the 1960s, and China distributed millions of copies of the photograph throughout Asia and Africa as evidence of what it called US imperialism. One of Browne&#x27;s photographs remains affixed to the sedan in which Quảng Đức was riding and is part of a tourist attraction in Huế.
For Browne and the AP, the pictures were a marketing success. Ray Herndon, the United Press International (UPI) correspondent who had forgotten to take his camera on the day, was harshly criticized in private by his employer. UPI estimated that 5,000 readers in Sydney, then a city of around 1.5–2 million, had switched to AP news sources.

Diệm&#x27;s English-language mouthpiece, the &quot;Times of Vietnam&quot;, intensified its attacks on both journalists and Buddhists. Headlines such as &quot;Xá Lợi politburo makes new threats&quot; and &quot;Monks plot murder&quot; were printed. One article questioned the relationship between the monks and the press by posing the question as to why &quot;so many young girls are buzzing in and out of Xá Lợi early [in the day]&quot; and then going on to allege that they were brought in for sexual purposes for the US reporters.

===Precedents and influence===
The practice of Vietnamese monks immolating themselves was not unprecedented. Instances of self-immolations in Vietnam had been recorded for centuries, usually carried out to honor Gautama Buddha. The most recently recorded case had been in North Vietnam in 1950. The French colonial authorities had tried to eradicate the practice after their conquest of Vietnam in the nineteenth century, but had not been totally successful. They did manage to prevent one monk from setting fire to himself in Huế in the 1920s, but he starved himself to death instead. During the 1920s and 1930s, Saigon newspapers reported multiple instances of self-immolations by monks in a matter-of-fact style. The practice had also been seen in the Chinese city of Harbin in 1948 when a monk sat down in the lotus position on a pile of sawdust and soybean oil and set fire to himself in protest against the treatment of Buddhism by the anti-religious communists of Mao Zedong. His heart remained intact, as did that of Quảng Đức.
After Quảng Đức, five more Buddhist monks immolated themselves up until late October 1963 as the Buddhist protests in Vietnam escalated. On 1 November, the ARVN overthrew Diệm in a coup. Diệm and Nhu were assassinated the next day. Monks have followed Quảng Đức&#x27;s example since for other reasons.

The Americans in Saigon often found the self-immolations to be surreal and made puns about &quot;bonze fires&quot; and &quot;hot cross bonzes&quot;. In one instance in 1963, the young son of an American officer based at the Saigon US Embassy doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire. He was seriously burned before the fire was extinguished and later said &quot;I wanted to see what it was like.&quot; Thích Quảng Đức&#x27;s actions were fatally copied in the United States in protest against the Vietnam War. On 16 March 1965, Alice Herz, an 82-year-old peace activist, immolated herself in front of the Federal Department Store in northwest Detroit. Later that same year, Norman Morrison, a 31-year-old Quaker pacifist, poured kerosene over himself and set light to himself below the third-floor window of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara at the Pentagon on 2 November 1965. A week later, Catholic Worker Roger Allen LaPorte did the same thing in front of the United Nations in New York City.

<doc id="694601" wikidata="Q3502117" url="?curid=694601" title="Oath of office of the president of the United States">
<text>The oath of office of the president of the United States is the oath or affirmation that the president of the United States takes upon assuming office. The wording of the oath is specified in Article II, Section One, Clause 8, of the United States Constitution, and a new president must take it before exercising or carrying out any official powers or duties.

This clause is one of three &quot;oath or affirmation&quot; clauses in the Constitution, but it is the only one that actually specifies the words that must be spoken. Article I, Section 3 requires Senators, when sitting to try impeachments, to be &quot;on Oath or Affirmation.&quot; Article VI, Clause 3, similarly requires the persons specified therein to &quot;be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution.&quot; The presidential oath requires much more than that general oath of allegiance and fidelity. This clause enjoins the new president to swear or affirm: &quot;I will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.&quot;

A newly elected or re-elected president of the United States begins his four-year term of office at noon on the twentieth day of January following the election, and, by tradition, takes the oath of office during an inauguration on that date; prior to 1937 the president&#x27;s term of office began on March 4. If January 20 falls on a Sunday, the president will be sworn in that day by taking the oath privately, but will then re-take the oath in a public ceremony the next day, on January 21.

Nine vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency upon the death or resignation of the president. In these situations the oath of office was administered to the new president as quickly as possible, as doing so allowed the presidency to continue uninterrupted.

== Administration ==
While the Constitution does not mandate that anyone in particular should administer the presidential oath of office, it has been administered by the chief justice beginning with John Adams, except following the death of a sitting president. George Washington was sworn into office during his first inauguration, on April 30, 1789, by Chancellor of New York Robert Livingston. William Cranch, chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court, administered the oath to Millard Fillmore on July 10, 1850, when he became president after the death of Zachary Taylor. Upon being informed of Warren Harding&#x27;s death, while visiting his family home in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as president by his father, John Calvin Coolidge Sr., a notary public. Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes administered the oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson aboard Air Force One after John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination on November 22, 1963; the only time a woman has administered the oath of office. Overall, the presidential oath has been administered by 15 chief justices (one of whom—William Howard Taft—was also a former president), one associate justice, four federal judges, two New York state judges, and one notary public.

=== Option of affirmation ===
The Constitutional language gives the option to &quot;affirm&quot; instead of &quot;swear.&quot; While the reasons for this are not documented, it may relate to certain Christians, including Quakers, who apply this scripture literally: &quot;But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation&quot; (James 5:12, KJV). Franklin Pierce is the only president known to have used the word &quot;affirm&quot; rather than &quot;swear.&quot; Herbert Hoover is often listed to have used &quot;affirm&quot; as well, owing to his being a Quaker, but a newsreel taken of the ceremony indicates that the words used were &quot;solemnly swear.&quot; Richard Nixon, who was also a Quaker, swore, rather than affirmed.

=== Forms ===
There have been two forms of administering, and taking, the oath of office.

Under the first form, now in disuse, the administrator articulated the constitutional oath in the form of a question, and modifying the wording from the first to the second person, as in, &quot;Do you, George Washington, solemnly swear ...&quot; and then requested an affirmation. At that point a response of &quot;I do&quot; or &quot;I swear&quot; completed the oath.

It is believed that this was the common procedure at least until the early 20th century. In 1881, the &quot;New York Times&quot; article covering the swearing in of Chester A. Arthur, reported that he responded to the question of accepting the oath with the words, &quot;I will, so help me God.&quot; In 1929, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the Chief Justice William H. Taft began the oath uttering, &quot;You, Herbert Hoover, do you solemnly swear ...&quot;, Hoover replied with a simple &quot;I do.&quot;

Under the second, and current form, the administrator articulates the oath in the affirmative, and in the first person, so that the president takes the oath by repeating it verbatim. Franklin Roosevelt, in 1933, stood silent as Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes recited the entire oath, then repeated that oath from beginning to end himself. By the time of Harry Truman&#x27;s inauguration in 1949, the practice was for the chief justice to utter the oath in phrases, with the president repeating those phrases, until the oath was completed.

== Use of Bibles ==

By convention, incoming presidents raise their right hand and place the left on a Bible while taking the oath of office. In 1789, George Washington took the oath of office with an altar Bible borrowed from the St. John&#x27;s Lodge No. 1, Ancient York Masons lodge in New York, and he kissed the Bible afterward.

Subsequent presidents up to and including Harry S. Truman, followed suit in kissing the Bible, although in 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower said a prayer at the end instead. Truman, Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama each swore the oath on two Bibles. 

The large leather-bound Bible used by Joe Biden had been in the Biden family since 1893.

Thomas Jefferson and Calvin Coolidge did not use a Bible in their oath-taking ceremonies. Theodore Roosevelt did not use the Bible when taking the oath in 1901, nor did John Quincy Adams, who swore on a book of law, with the intention that he was swearing on the Constitution. Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in at his first inauguration on a Roman Catholic missal on Air Force One, believing it was a Bible, in the immediate aftermath of the assassination of John F. Kennedy; he swore in on a Bible at his second inauguration.

Donald Trump swore on two Bibles for his first inauguration: one given to him by his mother when he was a child, and the Lincoln Bible. These two Bibles were present at Trump&#x27;s side during his second inauguration, but he did not place his hand on them. 
== &quot;So help me God&quot; ==

The First Congress explicitly prescribed the phrase &quot;So help me God&quot; in oaths under the Judiciary Act of 1789 for all U.S. judges and officers other than the president. It was prescribed even earlier under the various first state constitutions as well as by the Second Continental Congress in 1776. Although the phrase is mandatory in these oaths, the said Act also allows for the option that the phrase be omitted by the officer, in which case it would be called an &quot;affirmation&quot; instead of an &quot;oath&quot;: &quot;Which words, so help me God, shall be omitted in all cases where an affirmation is admitted instead of an oath.&quot; In contrast, the oath of the president is the only oath specified in the Constitution. It does not include the closing phrase &quot;So help me God,&quot; and it also allows for the optional form of an &quot;affirmation&quot; which is not considered an oath. In practice, most presidents, at least during the last century, have opted to take the &quot;oath&quot; (rather than an &quot;affirmation&quot;), to use a Bible to do so, and also to close the oath with the customary phrase.
There is currently debate as to whether or not George Washington, the first president, added the phrase to his acceptance of the oath. The earliest known source indicating Washington added &quot;So help me God&quot; to his acceptance, not to the oath, is attributed to Washington Irving, aged six at the time of the inauguration, and first appears 65 years after the event. The only contemporary account that repeats the oath in full, a report from the French consul, Comte de Moustier, states only the constitutional oath, without reference to Washington&#x27;s adding &quot;So help me God&quot; to his acceptance.

The historical debate over who first used &quot;So help me God&quot; is marred by ignoring the two forms of giving the oath. The first, now in disuse, is when the administrator articulates the constitutional oath in the form of a question, as in, &quot;Do you George Washington solemnly swear ...&quot;, requesting an affirmation. At that point a response of &quot;I do&quot; or &quot;I swear&quot; completes the oath. Without verbatim transcripts, the scant existing evidence shows this was the common procedure at least until the early 20th century. In 1865 the Sacramento &quot;Daily Union&quot; covered the second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln finished his oath with &quot;So help me God,&quot; and he kissed the Bible. The &quot;Daily Union&quot; account is embellished in several ways, and other newspaper accounts published nearer to the ceremony do not mention the phrase (but they do not quote the oath in any form). In 1881, the &quot;New York Times&quot; article covering the swearing in of Chester A. Arthur reported that he responded to the question of accepting the oath with the words, &quot;I will, so help me God.&quot; In 1929, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the chief justice began the oath uttering, &quot;You, Herbert Hoover, do you solemnly swear ...&quot; Hoover replied with a simple &quot;I do.&quot;

A contemporaneous newspaper account of Lincoln&#x27;s 1865 inauguration states that Lincoln appended the phrase &quot;So help me God&quot; to the oath. This newspaper report is followed by another account, provided later in the same year after Lincoln&#x27;s death (April 15, 1865), that Lincoln said &quot;So help me God&quot; during his oath. The evidence pertaining to the 1865 inauguration is much stronger than that pertaining to Lincoln&#x27;s 1861 use of the phrase. Several sources claim that Lincoln said &quot;So help me God&quot; at his 1861 inauguration, yet these sources were not contemporaneous to the event. During the speech, Lincoln stated that his oath was &quot;registered in Heaven,&quot; something some have taken as indicating he likely uttered the phrase &quot;So help me God.&quot; Conversely, there was a claim made by A. M. Milligan (a Presbyterian minister who advocated for an official Christian U.S. government) that letters were sent to Abraham Lincoln asking him to swear to God during his inaugurations, and Lincoln allegedly wrote back saying that God&#x27;s name was not in the Constitution, and he could not depart from the letter of that instrument.

Richard Gardiner&#x27;s research published in the &quot;White House History Quarterly&quot;, November 2024, offers contemporary evidence for presidents who used the phrase going back to William Henry Harrison in 1841, and Andrew Jackson.

All federal judges and executive officers were required as early as 1789 by statute to include the phrase unless they affirmed, in which case the phrase must be omitted. Given that nearly every president-elect since President Franklin D. Roosevelt has recited the additional phrase, it is likely that the majority of presidents-elect have uttered it.

== Mishaps ==

* In 1909, when President William Howard Taft was sworn in, Chief Justice Melville Fuller misquoted the oath, but the error was not publicized at the time. The mistake was similar to the one Taft himself would make twenty years later when, as Chief Justice, he swore in President Hoover. Recalling the incident, Taft wrote, &quot;When I was sworn in as president by Chief Justice Fuller, he made a similar slip,&quot; and added, &quot;but in those days when there was no radio, it was observed only in the Senate chamber where I took the oath.&quot;
* In 1925, Chief Justice Taft, himself formerly a president of the United States, administered second oath of President Calvin Coolidge saying &quot;...the office of &quot;the&quot; President of the United States&quot; instead of &quot;...the office of President of the United States&quot;, then continued the oath &quot;and &quot;that&quot; to the best of my ability&quot; instead of &quot;and &quot;will&quot; to the best of my ability&quot; as well as &quot;...protect, preserve and defend&quot; instead of the correct order &quot;...preserve, protect and defend&quot;.
* Again in 1929, Chief Justice Taft famously garbled the oath when he swore in President Herbert Hoover saying &quot;...the office of &quot;the&quot; President of the United States&quot; instead of &quot;...the office of President of the United States&quot;, then continued the oath &quot;and to the best of my ability&quot; instead of &quot;and &quot;will&quot; to the best of my ability&quot; as well as using the words &quot;preserve, &quot;maintain&quot;, and defend the Constitution,&quot; instead of &quot;preserve, &quot;protect&quot;, and defend the Constitution.&quot; Taft eventually acknowledged his error, but did not think it was important, and Hoover did not retake the oath. In Taft&#x27;s view, his departure from the text did not invalidate the oath.
* In 1945, President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s bare initial caused an unusual slip when he first became president and took the oath. At a meeting in the Cabinet Room, Chief Justice Harlan Stone, apparently mistaken about the meaning of Truman&#x27;s middle initial (which is not an abbreviation but rather the whole middle name in itself), began reading the oath by saying &quot;I, Harry Shipp Truman, ...&quot; Truman responded: &quot;I, Harry S. Truman, ...&quot;
* In both his 1953 and 1957 inaugurations, Dwight D. Eisenhower read the line &quot;the office of President of the United States&quot; as &quot;the office of &quot;the&quot; President of the United States,&quot; even as chief justices Fred Vinson (in 1953) and Earl Warren (in 1957) said the line correctly.
* In 1965, Chief Justice Earl Warren prompted Lyndon B. Johnson to say, &quot;the Office of &quot;the Presidency&quot; of the United States.&quot;
* In 1973, President Richard Nixon added the word &quot;and&quot; between &quot;preserve&quot; and &quot;protect,&quot; resulting in &quot;preserve &quot;and&quot; protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.&quot; Nixon had recited the line correctly during his first inauguration.
* In 2009, Chief Justice John Roberts, while administering the oath to Barack Obama, incorrectly recited part of the oath. Roberts prompted, &quot;That I will execute the Office of President &quot;to&quot; the United States &quot;faithfully&quot;.&quot; Obama stopped at &quot;execute,&quot; and waited for Roberts to correct himself. Roberts, after a false start, then followed Obama&#x27;s &quot;execute&quot; with &quot;faithfully,&quot; which results in &quot;execute faithfully,&quot; which is also incorrect. Obama then repeated Roberts&#x27; initial, incorrect prompt, with the word &quot;faithfully&quot; after &quot;United States.&quot; The oath was re-administered the next day by Roberts at the White House. This incident provided for the title and much of the content of Jeffrey Toobin&#x27;s 2012 book, The Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court.

== List of ceremonies ==

Since the office of President of the United States came into existence in 1789 there have been 59 public swearing-in ceremonies to mark the commencement of a new four-year presidential term, plus an additional nine marking the start of a partial presidential term following the intra-term death or resignation of an incumbent president. With the 2021 inauguration of Joe Biden, the presidential oath has been taken 76 different times by 45 persons. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because Inauguration Day has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inauguration ceremony. In addition, three have repeated the oath as a precaution against potential later constitutional challenges.

<text>Thomas Lowndes (January 22, 1766July 8, 1843) was an American planter, lawyer and politician from Charleston, South Carolina. He was the son of Rawlins Lowndes, governor of South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War and half-brother of William Lowndes (congressman), who helped secure the declaration of the War of 1812. Educated in Charleston, he studied law there and became a practicing lawyer in the city in the late 18th century. He was a member of the state legislature from 1792 to 1799. He represented South Carolina&#x27;s 1st Congressional District in the U.S. Congress from March 4, 1801, to March 3, 1805. He was not re-elected in 1804. He failed to win back his seat in 1808, and retired from public life thereafter. He died in Charleston on July 8, 1843.

<text>Eleuthère Paul du Pont (April 24, 1887 – September 26, 1950) was an American business magnate and the son of Francis Gurney du Pont. He founded Du Pont Motors, a manufacturer of automobiles and marine engines, and later bought and became president of Indian Motorcycles. He was inducted into the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Biography==
E. Paul du Pont was born on April 24, 1887, in New Castle, Delaware. He married in 1910 to Jean Kane Foulke du Pont, the granddaughter of William Foulke, discoverer of the first full dinosaur skeleton in the United States (&quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;), in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in 1858.

He purchased and took over management of Indian Motorcycles in 1930, where he led a purge of corruption in the prior management and refocused production and marketing on leisure use. According to the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in Ohio, du Pont saved Indian from financial ruin.

He was an avid hobbyist of waterwheels and millwork, and is said to have insisted upon always performing maintenance personally on the ornamental waterwheel in the gardens of the du Pont family estate.

He died on September 26, 1950, in Wilmington, Delaware.

==Legacy==
After E. Paul du Pont&#x27;s death, his wife founded the E. Paul du Pont Endowment for the Study of Crime, Delinquency, and Corrections at the University of Delaware, which led to the creation of its criminal justice program.

<text>George Dance the Younger RA (1 April 1741 – 14 January 1825) was an English architect and surveyor as well as a portraitist.

The fifth and youngest son of the architect George Dance the Elder, he came from a family of architects, artists and dramatists. He was described by Sir John Summerson as &quot;among the few really outstanding architects of the century&quot;, but few of his buildings remain.

==Life==

===Background and education===
The architect George Dance the elder married Elizabeth Gould in 1719. Their fifth son, George, was born 1 April 1741 at the family home in Chiswell Street, London and was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School.

Dance spent the six years between 1759 and 1765 studying architecture and draughtsmanship in Rome. Aged 17, he set off on his Grand Tour, sailing from Gravesend, Kent in December 1758. After a short stay in Florence, where he was joined by his brother Nathaniel, who was already studying painting in Italy, he and his brother set off for Rome, arriving in early May 1759. By the early 1760s the brothers were living at 77 Strada Felice. At Rome, Dance was acquainted with the architect James Adam who was staying nearby at the Casa Guarini, Robert Mylne (they remained lifelong friends), Abbot Peter Grant and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. As a student of the Accademia di San Luca, Dance measured and drew several buildings in Rome, including the three remaining columns of the Temple of Castor and Pollux, the Arch of Constantine and the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, showing much promise as a draughtsman. Much of his later work was inspired by Piranesi. In late 1759 Dance received his first commission – to design two chimneypieces for Sir Robert Mainwaring. 

In early 1762 Dance was measuring and drawing the Temple of Vesta, Tivoli and later that year he entered a competition organised by the &quot;Accademia di Parma&quot; to design &quot;A Public Gallery for Statues, Pictures &amp; c.&quot;. His drawings were dispatched to Parma in April 1763, and a few weeks later it was announced that he had won the gold medal, and his designs were exhibited at the Ducal Palace. The projected building was in the latest style of neoclassical architecture. During June 1764 the Dance brothers were in Naples, but later that year they were back in Rome, entertaining the actor David Garrick and his wife. On 21 December 1764 George Dance and his brother were elected to the Accademia di S. Luca, where he was described as &quot;Giorgo Danze, architetto Inglese&quot;. On 16 February 1765 Dance dined with the painter Angelica Kauffman and James Boswell who was visiting Rome. A few weeks later the brothers left Rome to return to London.

===Career===
On his return from the Grand Tour, George (the younger) joined his father&#x27;s office. His earliest London project was the rebuilding of All Hallows-on-the-Wall Church. He was one of five architects asked to submit designs, and his design was chosen on 8 May 1765. Work on the building starting in June 1765, at a cost of £2,941, and the building was consecrated on 8 September 1767.

In 1768, when he was only 27, George succeeded as Architect and Surveyor to the Corporation of London on his father&#x27;s death. His first major public works were the rebuilding of Newgate Prison in 1770 and building the front of the Guildhall, London. Other London works of his include the rebuilding of the Church of St Bartholomew the Less (1793), a former chapel within the precincts of Barts Hospital.

At Bath, Somerset he largely designed the Theatre Royal, built by John Palmer in 1804–5.

Coleorton Hall was one of his few buildings in the Gothic style.

Many of Dance&#x27;s buildings have been demolished, including the Royal College of Surgeons (apart from the portico), Newgate Prison, St Luke&#x27;s Hospital for Lunatics, the Shakespeare Gallery in Pall Mall, the library at Lansdowne House, the Common Council Chamber and Chamberlain&#x27;s Court at the Guildhall, Ashburnham Place, and Stratton Park (demolished save for its Doric portico).
Dance retired from practice in 1815.

Dance&#x27;s long career spanned several of the conventional phases of the Neo-Classical movement, from mid-18th century French Classicism to the full blown Greek Revival of the early 19th century. As such, he also played an important role in the careers of several major architects within this continuum, such as Sir John Soane and Sir Robert Smirke. His innovative interiors for the church of All Hallows-on-the-Wall, the Guildhall Common Council Chamber, and the sculpture gallery of Lansdowne House were key to the development of Soane&#x27;s first work at the Bank of England, the Bank Stock Office in 1792. On Dance&#x27;s recommendation, Robert Smirke joined Soane&#x27;s office as a pupil in 1796, but when the two fell out after less than a year, Dance continued to champion Robert Smirke who went on to become the country&#x27;s leading Greek Revival architects. Significantly, some of Dance&#x27;s later work embraced the increasingly austere Greek Revival style, such as the unfluted Doric portico on Stratton Park of 1803, derived from the temples at Paestum, and the unfluted Ionic portico on the Royal College of Surgeons (built 1806 onwards, so representing one of the first Greek Revival porticos in London). 
===The Royal Academy===
With his brother Nathaniel, George Dance was a founder member of the Royal Academy, founded on 10 December 1768. In 1795, with William Tyler, Dance was appointed to examine the accounts of the Royal Academy following the resignation of Sir William Chambers, and in 1796 they became the Academy&#x27;s first auditors, helping put the institution on a sounder financial footing.

In 1798 Dance succeeded Thomas Sandby as professor of architecture at the Royal Academy, but as he failed to deliver a single lecture he was dismissed in 1805 and replaced by his former pupil, Sir John Soane. For a number of years he was the last survivor of the 40 original Royal Academicians.

===A Collection of portraits===

Dance&#x27;s years after 1798 were devoted to art rather than architecture. His Academy contributions consisted of highly finished pencil profile portraits of his friends in Regency London&#x27;s artistic establishment. 72 etchings were engraved after them by William Daniell and &quot;A Collection of Portraits&quot; were published over ten years from 1804. Many are now held by the National Portrait Gallery.

===Personal life===
Dance married Mary Gurnell (born 7 February 1752 in Pitzhanger Manor) on 24 March 1772 at St. George&#x27;s, Bloomsbury. Their first child, Thomas, was born in Autumn 1773 and died in 1813. Two more sons followed: George (1778–1813) and Charles Webb (1785–1844). Mary Dance died at the age of 38 in 1791.

Dance suffered from ill health for the last three or four years of his life. He died on 14 January 1825, at No. 91 Gower Street, which is now marked with a blue plaque. He was buried in the crypt at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

It is located in the center of Nyírség as an agricultural town. The boundaries of the city are often understood as a very broad frame, because generally the near suburbs are included in them.

==History==
The first written mentions of Nyíregyháza date back to 1209, although it was then called simply &quot;Nyír&quot; (&#x27;birch&#x27;), after the &quot;Nyírség&quot;, the greater region in which the city lies. A source from 1326 mentions that by then the city already had a church, hence the second part of the name, &quot;egyház&quot; (meaning &#x27;church&#x27;). By the middle of the 15th century, the town had about 400 inhabitants. In the 16th century, during the Turkish occupation of Hungary, Nyíregyháza became deserted; it was resettled only in the 1630s–1640s.

After the War for Independence led by Prince Francis II Rákóczi, the town&#x27;s population increased. Most new settlers were Slovaks from the area of Békéscsaba. In 1786, Nyíregyháza was granted the right to hold four market days a year; by this time the town was the biggest in the county, with 7,500 inhabitants. In the early 19th century, Nyíregyháza was wealthy enough to secure freedom from its feudal lords, the Dessewffy and Károlyi families. During these prosperous years, the town got a new town hall, a hospital, several schools, and a restaurant by nearby &quot;Sóstó&quot; lake (&quot;Salty Lake&quot;).

The town&#x27;s inhabitants took an active part in the revolution and war for independence in 1848–49, and after the suppression of the revolution, several were imprisoned, among them the mayor, Márton Hatzel.

In the second half of the 19th century, Nyíregyháza became more and more urbanized, and in 1876, became the seat of Szabolcs County (now part of the larger integrated county Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg). In 1858, the railroad line reached Nyíregyháza; several new buildings were built, including a telegraph office, the main post office, and the theater. In 1881 the population consisted of 24,102 people, of which 13,534 were Hungarians, 8,678 Slovaks, 389 Germans and 1,501 of other ethnicities. In 1911, the tramway network was complete. After the grim years of World War I and the Hungarian–Romanian War, Nyíregyháza remained under Romanian occupation for ten months. Between the two world wars, the city celebrated the 100th anniversary of its independence from feudal landowners.

During World War II, Jews were used as forced laborers by Hungarians. After the German invasion, more than 6,000 of the city&#x27;s Jewish inhabitants were deported to Auschwitz. After the war, 2,000 Hungarians were sent to Soviet labor camps (colloquially called &quot;malenky robot&quot;, or &quot;little work&quot;). Several buildings were destroyed, too, including the Status Quo Synagogue, whose front wall was preserved and is now displayed in Nyíregyháza&#x27;s Jewish Cemetery.

A monument in the memory of the Holocaust victims was constructed in 2004.

From the 1960s, the city grew and developed quickly. Today, Nyíregyháza is one of the most prosperous cities in Hungary, serving as both a center of education and a popular tourist destination. It is known for having a bar in every street.

Nyíregyháza is the birthplace of Israeli artist Zeev Kun (1930-2024).

National road traffic to Budapest goes through the M3 motorway and four national highways (4, 36, 38, 41) and the lower state roads, other cities of the country and the settlements of Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg county. Szabolcs Volán Zrt. Launches long-haul flights to major cities in the region and to larger towns in the country.

Due to the nature of the city junction, Nyíregyháza&#x27;s road network is heavily loaded. The city center is surrounded by a 2X2-lane &quot;highway&quot;. And the narrow city center is bordered by the &quot;small boulevard&quot;, the northern, eastern and southern parts of which have already been completed. The M3 motorway, which recently reached the city, will hopefully reduce traffic and congestion on roads passing through the city center. At the same time the motorway reached the city, the east bypass (main road 403) was opened, allowing those traveling between Budapest and Záhony to avoid the city. Those coming to Debrecen no longer have to cross the city. The Nyíregyháza ring road includes the already completed 403 road and the M3 motorway south of the city. The missing parts of the ring road are Highway 338 (already authorized, but with an unknown construction date) in the west and the northern sector.

The most important of its railway connections is the 100 electric tram line between Szolnok and Záhony, from where the number 80 line to Tokaj, 113 line to Mátészalka and 116 line to Vásárosnamény branch out. Nyíregyháza is the final stop of the Ohat-Pusztakócs-Nyíregyháza railway line, which provides passenger traffic to Tiszalök. Next to the station are the Nyírvidék small railway to Dombrád and Balsa, which closed in December 2009. Nyíregyháza is one of the busiest railway stations in the country. There are InterCity flights to Budapest every hour to Debrecen and Miskolc. Nyíregyháza welcomes visitors to the city in a new and modern station building.

== Tourist sights ==

<doc id="694618" wikidata="Q3185911" url="?curid=694618" title="Josephine Hopper">
<text>Josephine &quot;Jo&quot; Verstille Hopper (née Nivison; March 18, 1883 – March 6, 1968) was an American painter and the wife of painter Edward Hopper. She studied under Robert Henri and Kenneth Hayes Miller, and won the Huntington Hartford Foundation fellowship.

==Life and career==
Born in Manhattan to Eldorado Nivison, a pianist and music teacher, and Mary Ann Nivison (née McGrath), Josephine was the second-born child, but her elder sibling had died in childhood sometime after 1883. Her younger brother Charles was born in 1884. Later in life she recounted that her father had practically no paternal instincts, and the family&#x27;s existence was always troubled. The Nivisons moved frequently, although remaining in New York City.
In 1900, Jo enrolled in the Normal College of the City of New York (now Hunter College), a free teacher-training school for young women. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1904 and decided to study art and eventually try to become an artist—already at college she started drawing and performing in productions of the drama club there. In late 1905 at the New York School of Art she met Robert Henri, who soon asked her to pose for a portrait (&quot;The Art Student&quot;, 1906). In February 1906, Nivison began her career as public school teacher. During the next decade she earned her living by teaching, but never abandoned art and remained in touch with Henri and many other artists; in 1907, she traveled to Europe with Henri and some of his students. By 1915, she joined the Washington Square Players as an actress and performed in their productions. During the summers, she frequented various New England art colonies.

By 1918, she was seeking a change of scene and a new job. She unsuccessfully applied for a job with the Red Cross, seeking to go abroad again. World War I had not yet ended, and she signed up to do hospital work overseas. Taking a leave of absence from the New York City public schools, Jo left in late 1918 only to return in January 1919, ill with bronchitis. She was discharged by the Surgeon General in June, and discovered that she had lost her teaching position. Penniless and homeless, she found temporary shelter thanks to an old sexton at the Church of the Ascension who had helped her after seeing her weeping in the church. It was not until a year later that she won the right for another job from the Board of Education; after that, she continued teaching and pursuing a career in art.

She first met her future husband, Edward Hopper, in art school, and then again in 1914 in Ogunquit, where they were staying in the same boarding house. However, their friendship apparently only began some years later. Their relationship became much closer during the summer of 1923, when they were both living in an art colony in Gloucester, Massachusetts. After a courtship that lasted for about a year, the couple married on July 9, 1924. They remained together until Edward Hopper died in 1967. Jo modeled for the figures in most of her husband&#x27;s paintings after 1924. Edward Hopper only produced one oil painting of his wife (&quot;Jo Painting&quot;, 1936), but frequently made watercolors, drawings and caricatures of her. Throughout her married life, Jo kept extensive diaries that recounted her life with Edward and his creative process. These diaries also reveal that the marriage was troubled; the couple had frequent rows that sometimes escalated into actual fighting. Twenty-two of Josephine Hopper&#x27;s diaries are in the collection of the Provincetown Art Association and Museum in Provincetown, MA.

As Edward Hopper&#x27;s career soared soon after the marriage and his reputation continued to grow, Jo&#x27;s artistic career waned after the 1920s. This was in part because &quot;Jo poured her considerable energies into tending and nurturing her husband&#x27;s work, handling loan requests and needling him into painting.&quot; She participated in a few group exhibitions (the biggest was organized by Herman Gulack in 1958 at the Greenwich Gallery), and she won the Huntington Hartford Foundation fellowship in 1957.

==Legacy==
After her husband died in 1967, Jo bequeathed her entire artistic estate (and that of her husband) to the Whitney Museum of American Art.

For a long time it was thought that the museum had discarded most of her work. In 2000, the writer Elizabeth Thompson Colleary discovered about 200 Jo Hoppers in the Whitney&#x27;s basement. Colleary says Jo was an &quot;uneven&quot; artist, but in general she thinks the work is good: &quot;I said to myself, &#x27;I will not resurrect this woman solely on the basis of the fact that Edward Hopper was her husband&#x27;.&quot; A few more works are known from photographs Jo made, as reproduced in Levin.

Additional works by Josephine Nivison Hopper have continued to surface, as reported by Elizabeth Thompson Colleary. Jo&#x27;s watercolors were exhibited at the Edward Hopper House Art Center, Nyack, NY, in 2014 and a few examples were included in an exhibition of &quot;Edward Hopper as Illustrator&quot; at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, also in 2014. In 2016, the Provincetown Art Association and Museum, Provincetown, Massachusetts, announced that 69 drawings and watercolors by Jo Hopper were included in the gift of Laurence C. and J. Anton Schiffenhaus, along with 96 drawings by Edward Hopper. An exhibition of these works, &quot;Edward and Josephine Hopper from the Permanent Collection: drawings, diaries, letters, watercolors,&quot; opened in August 2017. The exhibition was extended &quot;due to the overwhelming interest by scholars, critics and visitors&quot; and remained on display until August 2018. In 2021 the Edward Hopper House Museum &amp; Study Center presented the exhibition &quot;Josephine Nivison Hopper: Edward’s Muse&quot;, which featured Josephine Hopper&#x27;s watercolors.

==Influence on Edward Hopper==
As Edward Hopper&#x27;s wife and companion for more than 40 years, Jo influenced his work in numerous ways. Perhaps most importantly, it was her example that inspired Edward to seriously take up watercolor, during the summer of 1923.

A number of Jo&#x27;s works depict motifs that would later become important for her husband. The watercolor &quot;Shacks&quot;, done in 1923, depicts two houses behind a dead tree, a subject similar to many of Hopper&#x27;s later works. Jo&#x27;s watercolor &quot;Movie Theater—Gloucester&quot; (c. 1926–27) foreshadowed Edward&#x27;s interest in depicting movie theaters: he produced a drypoint of the subject in 1928, and then returned to it occasionally, most famously in the oil painting &quot;New York Movie&quot; (1939).

Beginning in the mid-1920s Jo became her husband&#x27;s only model. It was she who thought up the names for a number of her husband&#x27;s paintings, including one of his most famous oil paintings, &quot;Nighthawks&quot;. Despite their complicated relationship, she helped when her husband felt insecure about a painting in progress, as in, for example, the case of &quot;Five A.M.&quot; (1937). As late as 1936, Jo reported that her husband was highly competitive and that her starting a work would frequently inspire Edward to start his own. In &quot;The Lonely City&quot; Olivia Laing discusses Jo&#x27;s career and how it floundered because Edward was &quot;profoundly opposed to its existence. Edward didn&#x27;t just fail to support Jo&#x27;s painting, but rather worked actively to discourage it, mocking and denigrating the few things she did manage to produce&quot;.

It was at Jo&#x27;s insistence that Edward not paint any other women except herself. In addition to her roles as Edward&#x27;s muse and model, Jo served as the artists&#x27; record-keeper. In ledger books, now in the archives of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Jo maintained inventories of the Hoppers&#x27; works, Edward&#x27;s and her own. She wrote the descriptions that accompanied Edward&#x27;s pen-and-ink sketches of paintings that were turned over to the Rehn Galleries, and she recorded purchases by date, buyer, price, and commission. Jo&#x27;s sketchbook—including the notes, rough drawings, and scribbled maps that she made from the passenger seat as Edward drove their Buick—documents the couple&#x27;s summer driving trips in New England. Together with Jo&#x27;s prolific output of diary entries and letters, these materials provide &quot;A Window into the World of Edward and Josephine Hopper,&quot; to quote J. Anton Schiffenhaus.

<text>Castlerea ( ; ) is the third largest town in County Roscommon, Ireland. It is located in the west of the county and had a population of 1,992 at the 2016 census. Roughly translated from Irish, Castlerea is generally thought to mean &#x27;brindled castle&#x27; (Caisleán Riabhach). An alternative translation is &#x27;castle of the king&#x27; (Caisleán Rí). The town is built on the banks of the River Suck and the River Francis, both of which are tributaries of the River Shannon.

== History ==

Clonalis House, located in the west of Castlerea, is the ancestral home of the Clan O&#x27;Conor, the last of the High Kings of Ireland. The O&#x27;Connor dynasty produced eleven high kings of Ireland and twenty-four kings of Connacht.

Theophilus Sandford, a member of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army in Ireland, received a large allocation of lands confiscated from the O&#x27;Connor family as part of the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. This package included Castlerea. Castlerea developed under the Sandfords, who established a distillery (at its height producing more than of whiskey annually), a brewery, and a tannery. Sandford&#x27;s descendants continued in power through the 19th century. The estate was later acquired by the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board. The demesne in which it was set survives and is now enjoyed as a public park.

On 11 July 1921, Sergeant James King of the Royal Irish Constabulary was shot in Castlerea on St Patrick Street and died of his wounds shortly afterwards. The Truce of July 1921 was declared later that day, making Sergeant King the last casualty of the Irish War of Independence.

On 17 June 2020, Detective Garda Colm Horkan was shot dead by a 43-year-old man in Castlerea when his firearm was snatched from him who then fired fifteen rounds at him. Horkan became the 89th garda to be killed in the line of duty.

== Sport ==

Castlerea hosts soccer club Castlerea Celtic and St Kevin&#x27;s, a Gaelic football club and the Castlerea Cavaliers Basketball Ladies and Men teams. The Castlerea Enterprise Hub located in the town business park is also home to the town&#x27;s gym and to Castlerea Boxing Club.

Castlerea is home to boxing greats Aoife &amp; Lisa O&#x27;Rourke. Aoife O&#x27;Rourke (born 2 July 1997) is an Irish amateur boxer.[1] She has won two European Championships and represented Ireland at the 2020 Tokoyo Olympics.

== Education and industry ==
Castlerea&#x27;s major employers include Supervalu, Harmac Medical Products, Colour Communications Europe, Finola Foods and Lidl. Film production house Round Edge Films is based in Ballingare within Castlerea.

The schools in the town are all located in the same area; they include two primary schools (St Anne&#x27;s Convent National School and St Paul&#x27;s Boys National School), St Michael&#x27;s Special Needs School (which serves all ages), and Castlerea Community School (for second-level students). Castlerea Community School instructs approximately 500 students. It provides Leaving Certificate Applied classes as well as the Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate state examinations.

== Amenities ==

Amenities in the town include Castlerea golf club, established in 1905 and moved to its current location in 1907. It is a 9-hole course. There is an outdoor swimming pool open to the public during summers with a modern refurbished playground adjacent, a public library, a soccer pitch and O&#x27;Rourke Park which is a GAA pitch. The demesne is a large public park accessible off Main Street and home to some trees planted by notable figures, including former US ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith. The GAA owns a squash court and a handball court in the town. The Neighbourhood Youth Project (NYP) is a social venue for teenagers in the town. St Patrick&#x27;s Church (built in 1896) is the Catholic Church of the town. The town serves as the trailhead for the Suck Valley Way, with the 105-kilometre long trail beginning and ending in the town. Castlerea also serves as the trailhead for the Lung Lough Gara Way. Also, the Beara-Breifne Way also passes through the town.

== Transport ==

The main road through the town is the national secondary road N60, from Roscommon town onward to County Mayo. Other roads include the R361 to Boyle and the R377 to Castleplunket.

The Castlerea railway station opened on 15 November 1860. The railway station resides on the Westport-Dublin main line and connects to Dublin Heuston, Ballina and Westport.

<doc id="694625" wikidata="Q1704979" url="?curid=694625" title="Dragon Slayer (series)">
<text>is a series of role-playing video games by Nihon Falcom. The first &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; game is an early action role-playing game, released in 1984 for the NEC PC-8801 and ported by Square for the MSX. Designed by Yoshio Kiya, the game gave rise to a series of sequels, most of them created by Falcom, with the exception of &quot;Faxanadu&quot; by Hudson Soft. The &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series is historically significant, both as a founder of the Japanese role-playing game industry, and as the progenitor of the action role-playing game genre.

The series encompasses several different genres, which include action role-playing, action-adventure, platform-adventure, open world, turn-based role-playing, and real-time strategy. Many of the early titles in this series were PC games released for the PC-88, PC-98, MSX, MSX2, and other early Japanese PC platforms, while some were later ported to video game consoles. The series also features video game music soundtracks composed by chiptune musician Yuzo Koshiro and the Falcom Sound Team JDK.

==History==
Although commonly referred to as a series, the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; name is used to designate the body of work from producer Yoshio Kiya. There is no continuity in plot or even genre; however, most of the games use role-playing game (RPG) elements and experiment with real-time action gameplay.

===&quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot; (1984–1985)===
The original &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; and its sequel &quot;Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu&quot; are credited for being the progenitors of the action RPG genre, abandoning the command-oriented turn-based battles of previous RPGs in favour of real-time hack and slash combat that requires direct input from the player, alongside puzzle-solving elements. These games went on to influence later series such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Hydlide&quot;, and Falcom&#x27;s own &quot;Ys&quot;. The way the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series reworked the entire game system of each installment is also considered an influence on Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, which would do the same for each of its installments. According to &quot;GamesTM&quot; and John Szczepaniak (of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; and &quot;The Escapist&quot;), Enix&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was also influenced by &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; and in turn defined many other RPGs.

The original &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, released for the PC-88 in 1984, is considered to be the first action-RPG. In contrast to earlier turn-based roguelikes, &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; was a dungeon crawl RPG that was entirely real-time with action-oriented combat. &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; also featured an in-game map to help with the dungeon-crawling, required item management due to the inventory being limited to one item at a time, and introduced the use of item-based puzzles which later influenced &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; was a major success in Japan, where its overhead action-RPG formula was used in many later games. The game&#x27;s MSX port was also one of the first titles to be published by Square.

The sequel &quot;Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu&quot;, released in 1985, was a full-fledged action RPG with many character statistics and a large quest. &quot;Xanadu&quot; incorporated a side-scrolling view during exploration and an overhead view during battle, though some rooms were also explored using an overhead view. The game also allowed the player to visit towns with training facilities that can improve statistics and shops that sell items, equipment that change the player character&#x27;s visible appearance, and food that is consumed slowly over time and is essential for keeping the player character alive. It also introduced gameplay mechanics such as platform jumping, magic that can be used to attack enemies from a distance, an early Karma morality system where the character&#x27;s Karma meter will rise if he commits sin which in turn affects his ability to level up, a heavier emphasis on puzzle-solving, and individual experience for equipped items. It is also considered a &quot;proto-Metroidvania&quot; game, due to being an &quot;RPG turned on its side&quot; that allowed players to run, jump, collect, and explore. The game gained immense popularity in Japan; it set sales records for PC games in the country, where it sold more than 400,000 copies. &quot;Xanadu Scenario II&quot;, released the following year, was also an early example of an expansion pack. The game was non-linear, allowing the eleven levels to be explored in any order. It was also composer Yuzo Koshiro&#x27;s first video game music soundtrack.

According to creator Yoshio Kiya in 1987, when he developed &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;, &quot;&quot;Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Ultima&quot; were the only two kinds of RPGs&quot;, and so he &quot;wanted to make something new&quot; with &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; which &quot;was like a bridge&quot; to the &#x27;action RPG&#x27; genre and &quot;Xanadu&quot; took &quot;those ideas to the next level&quot;, after which &quot;more and more action RPGs were released&quot; to the point that action RPGs became &quot;one of the main genres of computer games&quot;. He also avoided random encounters, stating he &quot;always thought there was something weird about randomized battles, fighting enemies you can&#x27;t see, whether you want to or not&quot;.

===&quot;Romancia&quot; to &quot;Sorcerian&quot; (1986–1987)===
In 1986, &quot;Dragon Slayer Jr: Romancia&quot; simplified the RPG mechanics of &quot;Xanadu&quot;, such as removing the character customization and simplifying the numerical statistics into icons, and emphasized faster-paced platform action, with a strict 30-minute time limit. The action took place entirely in a side-scrolling view rather than switching to a separate overhead combat screen like its predecessor. These changes made &quot;Romancia&quot; more like a side-scrolling action-adventure game.

In 1987, &quot;Dragon Slayer IV: Drasle Family&quot; returned to the deeper action-RPG mechanics of &quot;Xanadu&quot; while maintaining the fully side-scrolling view of &quot;Romancia&quot;. The game also featured an open world and nonlinear gameplay similar to &quot;Metroidvania&quot; platform-adventures, making &quot;Drasle Family&quot; an early example of a non-linear, open-world action RPG. That same year also saw the release of &quot;Xanadu&#x27;s&quot; spin-off &quot;Faxanadu&quot;, a side-scrolling platform-action RPG. Later that year, the fifth entry &quot;Sorcerian&quot; was released. It was a party-based action RPG, with the player controlling a party of four characters at the same time in a side-scrolling view. The game also featured character creation, highly customizable characters, class-based puzzles, and a new scenario system, allowing players to choose which of 15 scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. It was also an episodic video game, with expansion disks released soon after offering more scenarios.

Two of the games released for the Nintendo Famicom, &quot;Dragon Slayer IV: Drasle Family&quot; and the spin-off of &quot;Xanadu&quot; known as &quot;Faxanadu&quot;, were released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. The former was renamed &quot;Legacy of the Wizard&quot;. The second of the three games released for the Nintendo Famicom, &quot;Romancia&quot;, has never been released in North America for any platform. An English fan translation of the Famicom version of &quot;Romancia&quot; was released in April 2008, by DvD Translations. An English version of &quot;Sorcerian&quot; was released in North America for MS-DOS in 1990, published by Sierra On-Line.

===&quot;The Legend of Heroes&quot; to &quot;Tokyo Xanadu&quot; (1989–2015)===
An English version of the 1989 title &quot;Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes&quot; was released for the TurboGrafx-CD in 1991, and is usually known as simply &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II&quot;, was released in 1992, but never saw an official English release. Subsequent &quot;The Legend of Heroes&quot; games dropped their association with the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series. In contrast to the action-oriented gameplay of most other &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; titles, both &quot;The Legend of Heroes&quot; titles use turn-based combat. The 1991 title &quot;Lord Monarch&quot;, on the other hand, was an early real-time strategy game. Several more games were released in the following years as part of the &quot;Xanadu&quot; subseries: the action role-playing games &quot;The Legend of Xanadu&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Xanadu II&quot;, released in 1994 and 1995 respectively, as well as &quot;Xanadu Next&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Tokyo Xanadu&quot; in 2015.

<doc id="694630" wikidata="Q1521415" url="?curid=694630" title="Children's rights movement">
<text>The Children&#x27;s Rights Movement is a historical and modern movement committed to the acknowledgment, expansion, and/or regression of the rights of children around the world. This act laid several constitutional laws for the growth of a child&#x27;s mental and physical health. (Not to be confused with Youth rights). It began in the early part of the last century and has been an effort by government organizations, advocacy groups, academics, lawyers, lawmakers, and judges to construct a system of laws and policies that enhance and protect the lives of children. While the historical definition of child has varied, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child asserts that &quot;A child is any human being below the age of eighteen years, unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.&quot; There are no definitions of other terms used to describe young people such as &quot;adolescents&quot;, &quot;teenagers&quot; or &quot;youth&quot; in international law.

The concept of children having particular rights is a relatively new one. Traditional attitudes towards children tended to consider them as mere extensions of the household and &#x27;owned&#x27; by their parents and/or legal guardian, who exerted absolute parental control.

Views began to change during the Enlightenment, when tradition was increasingly challenged and the value of individual autonomy and natural rights began to be asserted.

The Foundling Hospital in London was founded in 1741 as a children&#x27;s home for the &quot;education and maintenance of exposed and deserted young children&quot;. Thomas Spence, an English political radical wrote the first modern defence of the natural rights of children in &quot;The Rights of Infants&quot;, published in 1796.

== Social reform ==

With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, children as young as six began to be employed in the factories and coal mines in often inhumane conditions with long hours and little pay. During the early 19th century this exploitation began to attract growing opposition. The terrible conditions of the poor urban children was exposed to liberal middle-class opinion, notably by the author Charles Dickens in his novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Social reformers, such as the Lord Shaftesbury, began to mount a vigorous campaign against this practice.
Ameliorating legislation was achieved with a series of Factory Acts passed during the 19th century, where working hours for children were limited and they were no longer permitted to work during the night. Children younger than nine were not allowed to work and those between 9-16 were limited to 16 hours per day. Factories were also required to provide education to the apprentices in reading, writing and arithmetic for the first four years.

An influential social reformer was Mary Carpenter, who campaigned on behalf of neglected children who had turned to juvenile delinquency. In 1851 she proposed the establishment of three types of schools; free day schools for the general population, industrial schools for those in need and reformatory schools for young offenders. She was consulted by the drafters of educational bills, and she was invited to give evidence before House of Commons committees. In 1852 she established a reformatory school at Bristol.

In the United States, the Children&#x27;s Rights Movement began with the orphan train. In the big cities, when a child&#x27;s parents died or were extremely poor, the child frequently had to go to work to support himself and/or his family. Boys generally became factory or coal workers, and girls became prostitutes or saloon girls, or else went to work in a sweat shop. All of these jobs paid only starvation wages.

In 1852, Massachusetts required children to attend school. In 1853, Charles Brace founded the &quot;Children&#x27;s Aid Society&quot;, which worked hard to take street children in. The following year, the children were placed on a train headed for the West, where they were adopted, and often given work. By 1929, the orphan train stopped running altogether, but its principles lived on.
The &quot;National Child Labor Committee&quot;, an organization dedicated to the abolition of all child labor, was formed in the 1890s. It managed to pass one law, which was struck down by the Supreme Court two years later for violating a child&#x27;s right to contract his work. In 1924, Congress attempted to pass a constitutional amendment that would authorize a national child labor law. This measure was blocked, and the bill was eventually dropped. It took the Great Depression to end child labor nationwide; adults had become so desperate for jobs that they would work for the same wage as children. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act which, amongst other things, placed limits on many forms of child labor.

The Polish educationalist Janusz Korczak wrote of the rights of children in his book &quot;How to Love a Child&quot; (Warsaw, 1919); a later book was entitled &quot;The Child&#x27;s Right to Respect&quot; (Warsaw, 1929). In 1917, following the Russian Revolution, the Moscow branch of the organization Proletkult produced a Declaration of Children&#x27;s Rights.

== Rights of the Child ==
The first formal charter to set out the rights of children was drafted by British social reformer Eglantyne Jebb in 1923. Jebb founded Save the Children in 1919, one of the first charities aimed at the young, to help alleviate the starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany in World War I which continued after the Armistice.
Her experiences there and later in Russia, led her to believe that the rights of a child needed be especially protected and enforced, and her stipulations consisted of the following criteria:

#The child must be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spiritually.
#The child that is hungry must be fed, the child that is sick must be nursed, the child that is backward must be helped, the delinquent child must be reclaimed, and the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succored.
#The child must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.
#The child must be put in a position to earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.
#The child must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted to the service of its fellow men.
This manifesto was adopted by the International Save the Children Union and endorsed by the League of Nations General Assembly in 1924 as the World Child Welfare Charter. In 1925, the first International Child Welfare Congress was held in Geneva, where the Declaration was widely discussed and supported by organisations and governments.

== Declaration of the Rights of the Child ==
The SCIU also pressed the newly formed United Nations in 1946 to adopt the World Child Welfare Charter. This was achieved in 1959, when the United Nations General Assembly adopted an expanded version as the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Its main provisions are:

* protection rights: the right to be protected against maltreatment and neglect, the right to be protected from all forms of exploitation
* provision rights: the right to food and to health care, the right to education, the right to benefit from social security
* participation rights: the right to act in certain circumstances and the right to be involved in decision-making

From the formation of the United Nations to the present day, the Children&#x27;s Rights Movement has become global in focus. Children around the world still suffer from forced child labor, genital mutilation, military service, and sex trafficking. Several international organizations have rallied to the assistance of children. These include Save the Children, Free the Children, and the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund.

The Child Rights Information Network, or CRIN, formed in 1983, is a group of 1,600 non-governmental organizations from around the world which advocate for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Organizations report on their countries&#x27; progress towards implementation, as do governments that have ratified the convention. Every 5 years reporting to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child is required for governments.

==Children&#x27;s rights by country==

Many countries have created an institute of children&#x27;s rights commissioner or ombudsman, the first being Norway in 1981. Others include India, Finland, Sweden, and Ukraine, which was the first country worldwide to install a child in that post in 2005.

===Argentina===
In 2005, in order to implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, national Law for the Integral Protection of Children and Adolescents was enacted. This not only allows for protective measures for children, but also created the groundwork for a juvenile justice system. This system allows for children to be integrated back into society and established tactics to protect children from abuse and exploitation.

===Australia===
Australia is a participant to all significant treaties that impact on children&#x27;s rights. The rights and protection of children are governed by both Federal and state and territory law.

===Brazil===
Brazil is a founding member of the UN and a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by General Assembly resolution in 1948. The Universal Declaration of the Rights of the Child emphasizes that motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and that children born out of wedlock are allowed the same social protection. In 1990, Brazil approved the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and fully incorporated it onto Brazil&#x27;s positive law.

===China===
China has ratified many international documents with regard to children&#x27;s rights protection, including the 1989 Convention on Rights of the Child, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on Rights of Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography 2000, the Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention 1999, and The Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993.

===France===
France is in cooperation with all the major treaties dealing with children rights. It has in place several mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular, an ombudsman for children.

===Germany===
Germany is in agreement with the global conventions that protect the rights of the child. However, Germany prefers to interpret these according to the principles of European agreements, specifically the European Human Rights Convention and also in accordance with German Constitutional guarantees.

===Greece===
Greece has various laws and a number of measures and services to promote and advance the rights of children. In 2002, the Greek Parliament adopted a new law on human trafficking; in 2003 the juvenile system was reformed; in 2006 an additional law was created to combat intra-family violence which states a prohibition of corporal punishment of children.

=== Ireland ===
In 2015, the Republic of Ireland outlawed corporal punishment on children.

===United States===
There is a long history of children&#x27;s rights in the U.S.[20] Many children&#x27;s rights advocates in the U.S. today advocate for a smaller agenda than their international peers. According to the U.S, for the purposes of the present Convention, a child means every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier. Groups predominately focus on child abuse and neglect, child fatalities, foster care, youth aging out of foster care, preventing foster care placement, and adoption.[21] A longstanding movement promoting youth rights in the United States has made substantial gains in the past. Refer to the Convention of the Rights of a Child.

===United Kingdom===

The Children&#x27;s Rights Movement assert that it is the case that children have rights which adults, states and government have a responsibility to uphold. The UK maintains a position that UNCRC is not legally enforceable and is hence &#x27;aspirational&#x27; only - albeit a 2003 ECHR ruling states: &quot;The human rights of children and the standards to which all governments must aspire in realizing these rights for all children are set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.&quot; (Extract from Sahin v Germany, Grand Chamber judgment of the ECHR, July 8, 2003). 18 years after ratification, the four Children&#x27;s Commissioners in the devolved administrations have united in calling for adoption of the Convention into domestic legislation, making children&#x27;s rights legally enforceable..

==Convention on the Rights of the Child==

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child has 54 articles, each outlining a different right. They cover four different groupings of rights; survival, protection, development and participation.
The Convention establishes a standard premise for the children&#x27;s rights movement. It has been ratified by all but two countries; the United States and South Sudan. The US administration under Bush opposed ratifying the convention, stating that there were &quot;serious political and legal concerns that it conflicts with US policies on the central role of parents, sovereignty, and state and local law.&quot;

The convention is supplemented by the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (against military use of children) and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (against sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography).

=== Parental Rights ===
On October 7, 2020, the vote on United Nations Draft Resolution A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 - &quot;Rights of the child: Realizing the rights of the child through a healthy environment&quot; submitted by Germany (on behalf of the European Union), Uruguay (on behalf of GRULAC) was adopted. The Russian Federation Amendments L.57 and L.64 to include Parental Rights were rejected.

Russian Federation, Ms. Kristina Sukacheva (Introduced L.57- L.64) Tasked with introducing the Convention language on parental rights, Russia ominously noted that governments voting against parents &quot;deliberately shirk their international responsibilities to provide for the rights of the child&quot;.

At the time of adoption, Uruguay stated that the incorporation of parental rights language, added by the Russian Federation, would &quot;bring imbalance to the resolution and would also go against the spirit of the resolution&quot;. The assertion that parents knock children&#x27;s rights out of &quot;balance&quot; directly contravenes the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the international community&#x27;s most ratified treaty, which references parents, and their rights, repeatedly. Notably, the Russian addition was sourced word for word from the convention.

==Children in power==
Presently, there are at least thirty countries that have some kind of non-adult structure of parliament, whether nationally or in cities, villages or schools. Many children&#x27;s parliaments, especially in wealthier nations, are oriented more toward children&#x27;s education in politics than toward the actual exercise of power in adult political systems.

On the other hand, some children&#x27;s parliaments do exercise a degree of political power. One of the first children&#x27;s parliaments, set up in the 1990s in village schools in Rajasthan, India, involves children aged six to fourteen electing child representatives who have been able to make genuine differences for their communities. Some children&#x27;s parliaments, such as in the city of Barra Mansa in Brazil, have extensive powers over children&#x27;s issues and control parts of the government budget.

There are also private institutions which are largely governed by children, for instance democratic schools (including Sudbury schools).

<doc id="694636" wikidata="Q2703853" url="?curid=694636" title="Tarsiiformes">
<text>Tarsiiformes are a group of primates that once ranged across Europe, northern Africa, Asia, and North America, but whose extant species are all found in the islands of Southeast Asia. Tarsiers (family Tarsiidae) are the only living members of the infraorder; other members of Tarsiidae include the extinct &quot;Tarsius eocaenus&quot; from the Eocene, and &quot;Tarsius thailandicus&quot; from the Miocene. Two extinct genera, &quot;Xanthorhysis&quot; and &quot;Afrotarsius&quot;, are considered to be close relatives of the living tarsiers, and are generally classified within Tarsiiformes, with the former grouped within family Tarsiidae, and the latter listed as &quot;incertae sedis&quot; (undefined). Omomyids are generally considered to be extinct relatives, or even ancestors, of the living tarsiers, and are often classified within Tarsiiformes. 

Other fossil primates, including Microchoeridae, Carpolestidae, and Eosimiidae, have been included in this classification, although the fossil evidence is debated. Eosimiidae has also been classified under the infraorder Simiiformes (with monkeys and apes), and most experts now consider Eosimiidae to be stem simians. Likewise, Carpolestidae is often classified within the order Plesiadapiformes, a very close, extinct relative of primates. 

These conflicting classifications lie at the heart of the debate over early primate evolution. Even the placement of Tarsiiformes within suborder Haplorhini, as a sister group to the simians (monkeys and apes), is still debated.

==Classification==

Generally accepted members of this infraorder include the living tarsiers, the extinct omomyids, two extinct fossil genera, and two extinct fossil species within the genus &quot;Tarsius&quot;.

<text>Santa Felicita (Church of St Felicity) is a Roman Catholic church in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy, probably the oldest in the city after San Lorenzo. In the 2nd century, Syrian Greek merchants settled in the area south of the Arno and are thought to have brought Christianity to the region. The first church on the site was probably built in the late 4th century or early 5th century and was dedicated to Saint Felicity of Rome. A new church was built in the 11th century and the current church largely dates from 1736–1739, under design by Ferdinando Ruggieri, who turned it into a one nave edifice. The monastery was suppressed under the Napoleonic occupation of 1808–1810. 

The Vasari Corridor passes through the façade of this church and on the inside there is large window, covered by a thick gate, where the Grand Dukes of the Medici family used to listen to the mass without being seen by the people staying at ground level.

==Description==
In the piazza in front of the façade, stands the rebuilt 15th-century Column of Santa Felicita. Only the 14th century Chapter House survives from the Romanesque with fragmentary frescoes (1387) by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini (&quot;Crucifixion&quot; and in the ceiling, roundels with the &quot;Redeemer and the Seven Virtues&quot;). 

The Brunelleschian sacristy dates from 1473 and was under the patronage of the Canigiani family. There are the &quot;14th century Madonna with Child and Saints &quot;by Taddeo Gaddi, the 15th century &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; by Francesco d&#x27;Antonio and &quot;St. Felicity with Her Seven Sons&quot; by Neri di Bicci. 

The Barbadori (or Capponi) chapel dates also to the 15th century (1419–1423); it was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi and when the patronage passed to Lodovico di Gino Capponi the decoration was entrusted to Pontormo, who worked on it from 1525 until 1528. The painting of the vault has disappeared but in the chapel can still be seen the &quot;Four Evangelists &quot;in the pendentives and two of the greatest masterpieces by Pontormo: the &quot;Virgin and the Angel Gabriel&quot; on the side wall and the altarpiece of the &quot;Deposition&quot; above the end altar. The latter, enclosed in its gilded fame, with its surrealistic dimensions of elongated and entangled bodies and its range of iridescent colours, constitutes one of the most important works of Early Mannerism. The stained glass window depicting the &quot;Journey to the Sepulchre &quot;is a copy of the one done by Guglielmo da Marcillat in 1526. 

The desire to create a complementary space to this led to the decoration of the opposite Canigiani chapel by Bernardino Poccetti (&quot;Miracle of Our Lady of the Snow&quot;, 1589–1590). In 1565, as recorded by Vasari himself, Grand Duke Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici decided to build the long corridor which would connect the old Priors&#x27; Palace in Piazza della Signoria with the new Medici residence, previously property of the Pitti family; as this would pass through the church of Santa Felicita, the church began to play a very important role in the life of the Medici court. Cigoli was responsible for the design of the chancel whose patrons were the Guicciardini family (and where the famous historian Francesco was buried in 1540). The work continued until the vault was decorated by Cinganelli (); on the altar is the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; attributed to Francesco Brina (1587). 

In the church there are also the &quot;Martyrdom of the Maccabees &quot;(1863) by Antonio Ciseri in the 3rd chapel on the right, the &quot;Meeting of St. Anne and St. Joachim&quot;, attributed to Michele Tosini, at the end of the right transept, the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin with Saints&quot; (1677), attributed to Baldassare Franceschini, at the end of the left transept. In the Caponni chapel you can see &quot;The Deposition from the Cross&quot; (1528) by Jacopo Pontormo one of Pontormo&#x27;s surviving masterpieces.

The sacristy has a painted crucifix (circa 1310) attributed to Pacino di Buonaguida.

<text>Huangshan (), literally meaning the Yellow Mountain(s), is a mountain range in southern Anhui province in eastern China. It was originally called &quot;Yishan&quot;, and it was renamed because of a legend that Emperor Xuanyuan once made alchemy here. Vegetation on the range is thickest below , with trees growing up to the treeline at .

The area is well known for its scenery, sunsets, peculiarly-shaped granite peaks, Huangshan pine trees, hot springs, winter snow and views of the clouds from above. Huangshan is a frequent subject of traditional Chinese paintings and literature, as well as modern photography. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of China&#x27;s major tourist destinations.

==Physical description==

The Huangshan mountain range has many peaks, some more than 1,000 meters (3,250 feet) high. The three tallest and best-known peaks are &quot;Lotus Peak&quot; (Lianhua Feng, 1,864 m), &quot;Bright Peak&quot; (Guangming Ding, 1,860 m) and &quot;Celestial Peak&quot; (Tiandu Feng, literally &quot;Capital of Heaven Peak&quot;, 1,829 m). The World Heritage Site covers a core area of 154 square kilometres and a buffer zone of 142 square kilometres. The mountains were formed in the Mesozoic, approximately 100 million years ago, when an ancient sea disappeared due to uplift. Later, in the Quaternary Period, the landscape was shaped by the influence of glaciers.

The vegetation of the area varies with elevation. Mesic forests cover the landscape below 1,100 meters. Deciduous forest stretches from 1,100 meters up to the tree line at 1,800 meters. Above that point, the vegetation consists of alpine grasslands. The area has diverse flora, where one-third of China&#x27;s bryophyte families and more than half of its fern families are represented. The Huangshan pine (&quot;Pinus hwangshanensis&quot;) is named after Huangshan and is considered an example of vigor because the trees thrive by growing straight out of the rocks. Many of the pine trees in the area are more than a hundred years old and have been given their own names (such as the &quot;Ying Ke Pine&quot;, or &quot;Welcoming-Guests Pine&quot;, which is thought to be more than 1500 years old). The pines vary greatly in shape and size, with the most crooked of the trees being considered the most attractive. Furthermore, Huangshan&#x27;s moist climate facilitates the growing of tea leaves and the mountain has been called &quot;one of China&#x27;s premier green tea-growing mountains. &quot;Mao feng cha&quot; (&quot;Fur Peak Tea&quot;), a well-known local variety of green tea, takes its name from the downy tips of tea leaves found in the Huangshan area.

The mountaintops often offer views of the clouds from above, known as the &quot;Sea of Clouds&quot; () or &quot;Huangshan Sea&quot; because of the cloud&#x27;s resemblance to an ocean, and many s are known by names such as &quot;North Sea&quot; or &quot;South Sea&quot;. One writer remarked on the view of the clouds from Huangshan as follows:

The area also is host to notable light effects, such as the renowned sunrises. Watching the sunrise is considered a &quot;mandatory&quot; part of visiting the area. A phenomenon known as &quot;Buddha&#x27;s Light&quot; () is also well-known and, on average, Buddha&#x27;s Light only appears a couple of times per month. In addition, Huangshan has multiple hot springs, most of them located at the foot of the &quot;Purple Cloud Peak&quot;. The water stays at 42 °C (107.6 °F) all year, and has a high concentration of carbonates. The waters are said to help prevent skin, joint, and nerve illness.

==History==
Huangshan was formed approximately 100 million years ago and gained its unique rock formations in the Quaternary Glaciation.

During the Qin dynasty, Huangshan was known as &quot;Yishan&quot; (Mount Yi). In 747 AD, its name was changed to Huangshan (Mount Huang) by imperial decree; the name is commonly thought to have been coined in honor of Huang Di (the Yellow Emperor), a legendary Chinese emperor and the mythological ancestor of the Han Chinese. One legend states that Huangshan was the location from which the Yellow Emperor ascended to Heaven. Another legend states that the Yellow Emperor &quot;cultivated moral character and refined Pills of Immortality in the mountains, and in so doing gave the mountains his name. The first use of this name &quot;Huangshan&quot; often is attributed to Chinese poet Li Bai. Huangshan was fairly inaccessible and little-known in ancient times, but its change of name in 747 AD seems to have brought the area more attention; from then on, the area was visited frequently and many temples were built there.

Huangshan is known for its stone steps, carved into the side of the mountain, of which there may be more than 60,000 throughout the area. The date at which work on the steps began is unknown, but they have been said to be more than 1,500 years old.

Over the years, many scenic spots and physical features on the mountain have been named; many of the names have narratives behind them. For example, one legend tells of a man who did not believe the tales of Huangshan&#x27;s beauty and went to the mountains to see them; almost immediately, he was converted to the same view. One of the peaks he is said to have visited was named &quot;Shixin&quot; (), roughly meaning &quot;start to believe&quot;.

In 1982, Huangshan was declared a &quot;site of scenic beauty and historic interest&quot; by the State Council of China. It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990 for its scenery and for its role as a habitat for rare and threatened species. Subsequently, certified as a National Geopark, and then as a regional geopark (Asia Pacific Geopark Network), it was admitted as a UNESCO Global Geopark in 2004.

In 2002, Huangshan was named the &quot;sister mountain&quot; of Jungfrau in the Swiss Alps.

==Artistic and scientific inspirations==

Much of Huangshan&#x27;s reputation derives from its significance in Chinese arts and literature. In addition to inspiring poets such as Li Bai, Huangshan and the scenery therein has been the frequent subject of poetry and artwork, especially Chinese ink painting and, more recently, photography. Overall, from the Tang dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty, more than 20,000 poems were written about Huangshan, and a school of painting named after it. The mountains also have appeared in modern works; director James Cameron cited Huangshan as one of his influences in designing the fictional world of his 2009 film &quot;Avatar&quot;, and Chinese animated series &quot;Stitch &amp; Ai&quot;, a spin-off of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; franchise, is set in the Huangshan mountains.

The area also has been a location for scientific research because of its diversity of flora and wildlife. In the early part of the twentieth century, the geology and vegetation of Huangshan were the subjects of multiple studies by both Chinese and foreign scientists. The mountain is still a subject of research. For example, in the late twentieth century a team of researchers used the area for a field study of Tibetan macaques, a local species of monkey.

==Tourism==

Having at least 140 sections open to visitors, Huangshan is a major tourist destination in China. Huangshan City changed its name from Tunxi () in 1987 in order to promote Huangshan tourism. In 2007 more than 1.5 million tourists visited the mountain. The city is linked by rail and by air to Shanghai, and also is accessible from cities such as Hangzhou, Zhejiang and Wuhu, Anhui. Buses connect Huangshan City to the base of the mountain, where visitors can take a cable car or hike to the summit.

There are more than 50 kilometers of footpaths providing access to scenic areas for visitors and staffers of the facilities. Throughout the area there are hotels and guest houses that accommodate overnight visitors, many of whom hike up the mountains, spend the night at one of the peaks to view the sunrise, and then descend by a different route the next day. The area is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.

The hotels, restaurants, and other facilities at the top of the mountain are serviced and kept stocked by porters who carry resources around the mountain on foot, hanging their cargo from long poles balanced over their shoulders or backs.

==Climate==
Huangshan has a humid continental climate (Köppen Climate Classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) or a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) depending on the isotherm used. Its elevation makes it colder and wetter than the rest of Anhui.

<doc id="694664" wikidata="Q2008915" url="?curid=694664" title="Benjamin McCulloch">
<text>Brigadier-General Benjamin McCulloch (November 11, 1811 – March 7, 1862) was a soldier in the Texas Revolution, a Texas Ranger, a major-general in the Texas militia and thereafter a major in the United States Army (United States Volunteers) during the Mexican–American War, sheriff of Sacramento County, a U.S. marshal, and a brigadier-general in the army of the Confederate States during the American Civil War. He owned at least 91 slaves.

McCulloch was killed during the Battle of Pea Ridge.

==Early life==
He was born November 11, 1811, in Rutherford County, Tennessee, one of twelve children and the fourth son of Alexander McCulloch and Frances Fisher LeNoir. Benjamin&#x27;s father Alexander, a Yale University graduate, was a descendant of Captain Nicolas Martiau, the French Huguenot settler of Jamestown, Virginia and ancestor of President George Washington, and also had Scots-Irish ancestry. Alexander was also an officer on Brig. Gen. John Coffee&#x27;s staff during the Creek War of 1813 and 1814 in Alabama (and apparently at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815). His mother was a daughter of a prominent Virginian planter. The McCulloch family had been wealthy, politically influential, and socially prominent in North Carolina before the American Revolution, but Alexander had wasted much of his inheritance and was unable even to educate his sons. (Two of Ben&#x27;s older brothers had briefly attended a school in Tennessee taught by their neighbor, Sam Houston.) One of Ben&#x27;s younger brothers was Henry Eustace McCulloch, also a Confederate general officer. Another brother, Alexander, served in the Texas Revolution and as a captain in Mexico.

The McCulloch family, like many on the frontier, moved often by choice or necessity. In the twenty years following their move from North Carolina and Ben&#x27;s birth, they lived in eastern Tennessee, Alabama, and then western Tennessee. They finally settled at Dyersburg, where one of their closest neighbors was Davy Crockett, a great influence on young Ben.

In 1834, McCulloch headed west. He reached St. Louis just too late to join the fur trappers headed for the mountains for the season. He then tried to join a freight company heading for Santa Fe as a muleskinner, but was told they had a full complement. He moved on to Wisconsin to investigate lead-mining, but found all the best claims already staked by the large mining companies. In the fall of 1835, he returned to Tennessee to take up farming.

==Texas career==
When Crockett went to Texas in 1835 (following his defeat in his third congressional campaign), Ben McCulloch—tired of farming and seeking adventure—decided to accompany him, as did his brother Henry McCulloch. They planned to meet Crockett&#x27;s Tennessee Boys at Nacogdoches on Christmas Day. Crockett&#x27;s arrival in Nacogdoches was delayed due to hunting between the Bois d&#x27;Arc Creek and Choctaw Bayou. By January 5, 1836, Crockett found his way to Nacogdoches. There, Ben McCulloch greeted him after having convinced his brother, Henry McCulloch to return to Tennessee. Ben subsequently contracted measles and was bedridden for several weeks. Crockett pressed on toward San Antonio. McCulloch&#x27;s illness prevented him from arriving in San Antonio until after the Alamo had already fallen.

McCulloch joined the Texas army under Sam Houston in its retreat to east Texas. Assigned to Captain Isaac N. Moreland&#x27;s artillery company at the Battle of San Jacinto (April 21, 1836), he commanded one of the &quot;Twin Sisters&quot;—two six-pounder cannon sent to aid the Texans by the citizens of Cincinnati. One of the twin sisters was named Eleanor, the other Elizabeth. It is believed he chose to command Elizabeth to honor his dear friend and mentor, David Crockett, whose widow was Elizabeth Crockett. He made deadly use of his cannon against the Mexican positions and received a battlefield commission as first lieutenant. For his service (dating before April 18, 1836), McCulloch was issued Texas Bounty Certificate No. 2473 for 320 acres (.5 mi2, 1.3 km2). In 1839, he also received Donation Certificate No. 776 for 640 acres (1 mi2, 2.6 km2), for his service at San Jacinto.

McCulloch was then attached to Captain William H. Smith&#x27;s cavalry company, but returned to Tennessee to recruit a company of volunteers to return to Texas. He returned a few months later with a company of thirty volunteers which he had placed under the command of his friend, Robert Crockett, David Crockett&#x27;s son.

By 1838, he had taken up the profession of surveying land for the Republic of Texas in and around the community of Seguin, later joining the Texas Rangers as lieutenant to Captain John Coffee &quot;Jack&quot; Hays. He acquired a reputation as an Indian fighter, favoring shotguns, pistols, and Bowie knives to the regulation saber and carbine.

On the strength of his new fame, he was elected to the Republic of Texas House of Representatives in 1839. The campaign was contentious, and McCulloch fought a rifle duel the next year against Colonel Reuben Ross, resulting in a wound that left his right arm crippled for life. Ben considered the matter closed, but it flared up again the following year, this time involving Henry McCulloch, who killed Ross with a pistol.

In 1842, McCulloch went back to surveying and intermittent military service. At the Battle of Plum Creek, August 12, 1840, he served as a scout against the Comanches, and then commanded the right wing of the Texas army. When a Mexican raiding party under General Ráfael Vásquez invaded San Antonio in February 1842, McCulloch was prominent in the fighting that pushed the Mexicans back beyond the Rio Grande. A second Mexican raid led by General Adrian Woll in September of that year again captured San Antonio. McCulloch then served as a scout for Captain Hays&#x27; Rangers. He and his brother, Henry, subsequently took part in the failed Somervell expedition and both escaped very shortly before most of the Texans were captured at Ciudad Mier, Mexico in Tamaulipas, December 25, 1842.

Samuel Reid, a volunteer from Louisiana, described McCulloch and his ranger company as &quot;men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger, and a brace of pistols around their waists, [who] were occupied drying their blankets, cleaning and fixing their guns, and some employed cooking at different fires, while others were grooming their horses. A rougher-looking set we never saw. They were without tents, and a miserable shed afforded them the only shelter. Captain McCulloch introduced us to his officers and many of his men, who appeared orderly and well-mannered people. But from their rough exterior, it was hard to tell who or what they were. Notwithstanding their ferocious and outlaw look, there were among them doctors and lawyers and many a college graduate.&quot;

==War with Mexico==
In 1845, McCulloch was elected from Gonzales County to the first Texas state legislature following its entry into the union. In the spring of 1846, a law was passed appointing him Major-General in command of all Texas militia west of the Colorado River. That same year, with the outbreak of the war with Mexico, he raised a company of Rangers that became Company A of Col. Hays&#x27;s 1st Regiment of Texas Mounted Volunteers, who were known for their ability to regularly travel 250 miles in ten days or less. He subsequently was named chief of scouts under Gen. Zachary Taylor, with the rank of major, and became known nationwide for his daring exploits in northern Mexico. (His company of scouts included George Wilkins Kendall, editor of the New Orleans &quot;Picayune&quot;.) By this time, McCulloch was fluent in Spanish and his woodsman&#x27;s skills enabled him to slip back and forth across the lines undetected—more than once penetrating to within a mile of Santa Anna&#x27;s own tent.

McCulloch led his scouting company as mounted infantry at the Battle of Monterrey and his expert reconnaissance work preceding the Battle of Buena Vista probably saved Taylor&#x27;s army from disaster.(how?) After Buena Vista he was promoted to the rank of major of U.S. Volunteers.

At the war&#x27;s end, McCulloch scouted for Maj. Gen. David E. Twiggs, but joined the rush to the California gold fields in 1849. While he never struck gold, he was elected sheriff of Sacramento. (His old commander, Col. Hays, had been elected sheriff of San Francisco on the same day.) His old friends Sam Houston and Thomas J. Rusk, both now in the U.S. Senate, tried to arrange for his appointment to command a frontier army regiment, but his lack of formal education was against him and the appointment never went through. In 1852, President Franklin Pierce promised him command of the U.S. Second Cavalry, but Secretary of War Jefferson Davis gave it instead to Albert Sidney Johnston.

McCulloch was appointed U.S. marshal for the Eastern District of Texas in 1852, serving throughout the Pierce and Buchanan administrations. However, conscious of his lack of formal military education, he actually spent much of his term studying military science in libraries in Washington, D.C. In the aftermath of the Utah War, in 1858 he was one of two Peace Commissioners sent to deliver President Buchanan&#x27;s pardon to Brigham Young in Utah (the other being former Gov. Lazarus W. Powell of Kentucky). As the Commissioners stated during meetings with Brigham and Church leadership, they had no power to negotiate. The Buchanan pardon was non-negotiable: 1) submit to Federal authority, and 2) allow the army to pass through Salt Lake City and establish a post somewhere in Utah. Brigham accepted the pardon under protest that the members of the Church had committed no crimes other than burning the US Army supply train contracted with Majors &amp; Waddell, on the high plains of Wyoming. McCulloch in effect ended the Utah War when he changed the tone of the 2-day meeting on the 2nd morning, June 12, 1858, as reported by the New York Herald, 9 August 1858, 8/2-3: &quot;But while a torrent of beastly and disgusting words were issuing from the throat of [Apostle Erastus] Snow, Commissioner McCulloch interrupted him with this remark: &quot;...but I tell you sir, the army shall come in, and no power here can prevent it.&quot;&quot;

==Civil War service==
Texas seceded from the union on February 1, 1861, and on February 14, McCulloch received a colonel&#x27;s commission from Confederate President Jefferson Davis, with the comment that &quot;to Texans, a moment&#x27;s notice is sufficient when their State demands their service.&quot; He was authorized to demand the surrender of all federal military posts in the state. Subsequently, on the morning of February 16, U.S. Army General Twiggs, finding that more than 1,000 Texas troops had surrounded his installations in an orderly manner during the night, turned over to McCulloch all federal property in San Antonio. In return Twigg&#x27;s troops were to be allowed to leave the state unharmed. On May 11, President Davis appointed McCulloch a brigadier-general.
McCulloch was placed in command of the Indian Territory. He set up his headquarters at Little Rock, and began piecing together an Army of the West, with regiments from Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. He disagreed strongly with General Sterling Price of Missouri, but with the assistance of Brigadier-General Albert Pike, he was able to build alliances for the Confederacy with the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek nations.

On August 10, 1861, McCulloch&#x27;s troops, though relatively poorly armed, handily defeated the army of Brigadier-General Nathaniel Lyon at the Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Missouri. &quot;We have an average of only twenty-five rounds of ammunition to the man,&quot; McCulloch reported, &quot;and no more to be had short of Fort Smith and Baton Rouge.&quot; He did not have a high opinion of Price&#x27;s Missourians, noting that they were undisciplined, commanded mostly by incompetent and inexperienced politicians, and possessed only a poor mix of weapons and equipment. For some 5,000 of them, their enlistment time was up and they were anxious to go home. Cooperation between the Arkansas and Missouri contingents was feeble, with &quot;little cordiality of feeling between the two armies.&quot; His lack of confidence in the Missourians led McCulloch to hesitate when a bold attack might well have destroyed Lyon&#x27;s smaller force and given Missouri to the Confederacy.

The continuing feud between McCulloch and Price led to the appointment of Major-General Earl Van Dorn to overall command, Henry Heth and Braxton Bragg having declined the appointment. When Van Dorn launched an expedition against St. Louis, a strategy McCulloch strongly opposed, it was again McCulloch&#x27;s reconnaissance that contributed most to what little success Van Dorn&#x27;s plan was able to achieve.

McCulloch commanded the Confederate right wing at the Battle of Pea Ridge (or Elkhorn Tavern), Arkansas, and on March 7, 1862, after much maneuvering his troops overran a key Union artillery battery. Union resistance stiffened late in the morning, however, and as McCulloch rode forward to scout out enemy positions, he was shot out of the saddle and died instantly. McCulloch always disliked army uniforms and was wearing a black velvet civilian suit and Wellington boots at the time of his death. Credit for the fatal shot was claimed by sharpshooter Peter Pelican of the 36th Illinois Infantry.

McCulloch&#x27;s next in command, Brig. Gen. James M. McIntosh, head of the cavalry, was killed a few minutes later in a charge to recover McCulloch&#x27;s body. Confederate Col. Louis Hébert was captured in the same charge, and the Confederate forces, with no remaining leadership, slowly fell apart and withdrew. Historians generally blame the Confederate disaster at Pea Ridge and the subsequent loss of undefended Arkansas on the death of McCulloch.

McCulloch&#x27;s body was buried on the field at Pea Ridge, but was subsequently removed with other victims of the battle to a cemetery in Little Rock. He was later reinterred in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin; the gravesite is in the cemetery&#x27;s Republic Hill section, Row N, No. 4. His papers are housed at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History (previously the Barker Texas History Center) at the University of Texas at Austin. McCulloch County, Texas, formed in 1856 and located in the present geographical center of the state, was named for him. He is also one of thirty men inducted into the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame at Fort Fisher, Waco.

Shortly after Pea Ridge, Albert Pike, now a brigadier-general, constructed Fort McCulloch as the principal Confederate fortification in the southern section of the Indian Territory, naming it after his late commander. It was built on a bluff on the south bank of the Blue River and is now located in Bryan County, Oklahoma. It was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Camp Ben McCulloch (&quot;see&quot; External Links below) was established near Austin in 1896 as a reunion site for the United Confederate Veterans and is the last such site still owned by the UCV&#x27;s descendant group, the Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy. It is now a public recreation facility of some 200 acres (0.8 km2), operated by the County of Hays, and is a popular location for Central Texas family reunions, picnics, and musical festivals.

Several other members of McCulloch&#x27;s family followed him to Texas, including his mother. She died in Ellis County in 1866 at the home of another of her sons, John C. McCulloch, who had been a captain in the Confederate army. Her remains were exhumed in 1938 by the State of Texas and reinterred beside those of Gen. Ben McCulloch, and a joint monument was erected. Other siblings lived in Gonzales and in Walker County.

==In popular culture==
*Steve Earle wrote a song about McCulloch on his album Train a Comin&#x27;. &quot;Ben McCulloch&quot; is sung from the perspective of a foot soldier in McCulloch&#x27;s infantry, marched from Texas to fight in Missouri and growing to hate both McCulloch and the Civil War. Its chorus and refrain is &quot;Goddamn you, Ben McCulloch / I hate you more than any other man alive // And when you die, you&#x27;ll be a foot soldier just like me / in the Devil&#x27;s infantry.&quot;
*He is the main antagonist in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s short story &quot;Lee at the Alamo&quot; (2011). 
*He is also a character in Janice Woods Windle&#x27;s True Women which was later made into a TV movie.
*There is a mention of McCulloch&#x27;s Rangers in Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; on page 95, where the men from the Glanton gang are said to be from McCulloch&#x27;s Rangers: &quot;(...) Tate from Kentucky who had fought with McCulloch&#x27;s Rangers as had Tobin and others among them (...)&quot;.

<doc id="694671" wikidata="Q2125094" url="?curid=694671" title="I Love You, California">
<text>&quot;I Love You, California&quot; is the state song and regional anthem of the U.S. state of California, originally published in 1913. It was adopted in 1951 and reconfirmed in 1987 as the official state song.

The lyrics were written by Francis Beatty Silverwood (1863–1924), a Los Angeles clothier, and the words were subsequently put to music by Abraham Franklin Frankenstein (1873–1934), then conductor of the Orpheum Theatre Orchestra, with an inaugural performance by Mary Garden. Frankenstein was a cousin of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&#x27;s&quot; long-time music and art critic Alfred V. Frankenstein. The song was published by Hatch &amp; Loveland, Music Printers, Los Angeles, California, and copyrighted by F.B. Silverwood in 1913. It was the official song of expositions held in San Francisco and San Diego in 1915.

==History==

=== Premiere ===

Later in 1913, the song was introduced by opera star Mary Garden, associated with the Chicago Grand Opera at that time. &quot;Mary Garden stopped Grand Opera to make this California song famous,&quot; read the notices virtually ensuring the popularity and success of the new song. The renowned soprano wrote on stationery from the Hotel Alexandria in Los Angeles:

=== Played aboard the SS &quot;Ancon&quot; ===

&quot;I Love You, California&quot; was played aboard the steamship &quot;Ancon&quot;, which on August 14, 1914, became the first merchant ship to pass through the Panama Canal.

=== State legislative designation ===
In 1951, the State Legislature passed a resolution designating it as California&#x27;s state song. California Government Code section 421.7 states, &quot;I Love You, California&quot;, a song published in 1913 with lyrics by F.B. Silverwood and music by A.F. Frankenstein, is an official state song.&quot;

In 1987, &quot;I Love You, California&quot; became the official state song by law.

==Commercial use==
In late 2012, Jeep began running a TV advertisement in California, with &quot;I Love You, California&quot; as the soundtrack and visuals showing the Californian state flower, Californian flag, and other Californian icons.

The song also serves as the theme music for the state’s public television human interest series “California’s Golden Parks”, presented by Huell Howser.

==In popular culture==

An arrangement of the song is heard when the player builds the Golden Gate Bridge in &quot;Civilization VI: Gathering Storm&quot;, accompanied by the first four lines of Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;A Bridal Song&quot;.

The song is also the official anthem of the New California Republic in the &quot;Fallout&quot; universe. 

== Lyrics ==
== Other non-official state songs ==

During the years following, several attempts were made to make other songs the official state song. In 1921, Lynden Ellsworth Behymer (1862–1947), impresario, and Bessie Bartlett Frankel (Mrs. Cecil Frankel) (1884–1959), donated a sum of money to the California Federation of Music Clubs to hold a contest for lyrics to a state song &quot;of real value.&quot; The judges were Benjamin Franklin Field (1868–1960), chairman of the federation and chairman of the committee of judges, Grace Atherton Dennen (1874–1927), editor and publisher of &quot;The Lyric West&quot;, and Blanche Robinson (Mrs. Martin Hennion Robinson) (&quot;née&quot; Williams; 1883–1969), composer. The original deadline, October 1, 1921, was extended to December 31, 1921 and the prize money was increased to $100. The judges selected Mary Lennox of San Francisco on January 17, 1922, as the winner was &quot;California, Sweet Homeland of Mine&quot;:

<text>Claiborne Fox Jackson (April 4, 1806 – December 6, 1862) was an American politician of the Democratic Party in Missouri. He was elected as the 15th Governor of Missouri, serving from January 3, 1861, until July 31, 1861, when he was forced out by the Unionist majority in the Missouri General Assembly after planning to force the secession of the state.

Before the war, Jackson worked with his father-in-law, John Sappington, to manufacture and sell patent medicines, in the form of quinine pills, to treat and prevent malaria.

He became quite wealthy and politically influential, deeply involved in the Democratic party in Saline County and central Missouri. He served twelve years in the Missouri House of Representatives, twice as Speaker. In 1848 he was elected to the State Senate. During the 1860 election, Jackson professed to be a Unionist. However, in 1861, after the Missouri Convention rejected secession, Jackson secretly planned a secessionist coup in league with the Confederate government.

In 1860 Jackson successfully ran for governor as a moderate on the issue of secession. During his inaugural speech of January 3, 1861, however, he declared that Missouri would resist any Union coercion by force of arms. He then called for a convention to pass a secession ordinance, but that body, dominated by Unionists, defeated the measure. After the fall of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, in April 1861, Jackson denounced President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s call for volunteers and began plotting to seize the U.S. Arsenal in St. Louis. To that end he dispatched secret emissaries to Confederate president Jefferson Davis and received four large cannon.

But Jackson&#x27;s scheme was defeated by the prompt actions of Cap. Nathaniel Lyon, who attacked and scattered Jackson&#x27;s “State Guard” at Camp Jackson on May 10, 1861. Jackson fled the state capital, Jefferson City, as Lyon&#x27;s forces approached and established a rump legislature at Neosho; this body formally voted to secede the following October. However, continuing Union successes under Gen. Samuel R. Curtis sent the secessionist governor and his followers fleeing again, this time into Arkansas, where they erected a temporary capital at Camden.

Jackson died of pneumonia, resulting from complications from stomach cancer on December 7, 1862, in Little Rock, Arkansas.

He was replaced by Lieutenant Governor Thomas C. Reynolds.

The exile government continued, setting up shop in Shreveport, Louisiana and then Marshall, Texas. The government took part in and sent representatives to the Confederate government. The exile government was formally disbanded at the conclusion of the Civil War.

== Early life ==
Claiborne Fox Jackson, son of Dempsey Carroll and Mary Orea &quot;Molly&quot; (née Pickett) Jackson, was born in 1806 in Fleming County, Kentucky. He had several older brothers. His father, Dempsey Carroll Jackson, was a wealthy tobacco planter and slaveholder. He was likely tutored at home and taught to be a planter.
Claiborne Fox&#x27;s second cousin was John Jackson and his third cousin was Jarvis Jackson Jr, father and brother of Hancock Lee Jackson (respectively). Hancock Lee Jackson, the 13th governor of Missouri, was also Claiborne Fox Jackson&#x27;s 3rd cousin. The two shared a great-grandfather, Joseph Jackson Sr. John and Jarvis Jr. later sold the land that would become Laurel County, Kentucky.

==Migration to Missouri – career and marriages==
In 1826 Jackson moved with several of his older brothers to Missouri, settling in the Howard County town of Franklin. The Jackson brothers established a successful general mercantile store.

In early 1831, Jackson married Jane Breathitt Sappington, daughter of Dr. John Sappington, a prominent frontier physician, and his wife, Jane, in Arrow Rock, Missouri. From Maryland and Nashville, Tennessee, Sappington had met his wife in Kentucky. She was a sister of future Kentucky Governor John Breathitt and two other politically connected brothers. After living in Franklin, Tennessee, they migrated to Missouri in 1817, settling in Arrow Rock a couple of years later. In addition to developing businesses, Sappington eventually acquired thousands of acres of land and became a major slaveholder.

But Jane Jackson died a few months after the wedding. That year her father established the Sappington Cemetery on his plantation for family burials, perhaps because of his daughter Jane&#x27;s death.

Claiborne Jackson continued to work with his brothers after his wife&#x27;s death, until 1832 and the outbreak of hostilities in the Black Hawk War. As a young widower, Claiborne Jackson organized, and was elected captain of, a unit of Howard County volunteers for the conflict.

After returning from the war, Jackson decided to make a change, moving to nearby Saline County, where his father-in-law lived. He worked for him for a time in the family businesses. This was also part of the region along the Missouri River known as &quot;Little Dixie.&quot;

In 1833 Jackson married Louisa Catherine Sappington, a younger sister of his late wife. He worked with his father-in-law and brother-in-law Erasmus Sappington in the manufacture and sale of &quot;Dr. Sappington&#x27;s Anti-Fever Pills&quot;, a patent medicine preventative and treatment for malaria. The pills were filled with quinine, which Sappington manufactured from ground cinchona bark imported from Peru. He developed wide distribution of the pills, which became best sellers. Malaria was prevalent throughout the Missouri and Mississippi valleys, as were yellow fever, scarlet fever, and influenza. Saline County was relatively near the head of the Santa Fe Trail in neighboring Howard County. Traders and emigrants traveling through the area were also eager to buy pills to treat malaria.

Subsequently, both men and their entwined, extended families became quite wealthy and influential in the region. In May 1838, Jackson&#x27;s second wife, Louisa, died, likely from complications of childbirth. Their infant son, Andrew Jackson, died the next month. That same year Jackson married again, to the widowed Elizabeth (Eliza) Whitsett (Sappington) Pearson, also a daughter of his parents-in-law. They had two daughters together, Louisa Jane (1841–1918) and Annie E. Jackson (1844–1926).

== Political career ==
Through his family connections with Dr. Sappington, Jackson, along with his brother-in-law Meredith M. Marmaduke, became deeply involved with Missouri Democratic Party politics. Jackson was first elected in 1836 to the Missouri House of Representatives, where he represented Saline County.

He moved to the Howard County seat of Fayette, Missouri—then a center of political power in the state—in 1838 and worked for the local branch of the state bank. This would pay great political dividends later in his career. Claiborne Jackson served a total of twelve years in the Missouri House, including terms as Speaker in 1844 and 1846.

In 1840 Jackson nearly became involved in a duel over politics; duels had been prohibited. Writing anonymously to a Fayette, Missouri newspaper, Jackson made accusations that John B. Clark, the Whig candidate for Missouri Governor that year, was guilty of election fraud. The men exchanged more harsh words, and Clark challenged Jackson to a duel. The matter was settled without gunplay. Later, after Clark had switched party allegiance to the Democrats, he and Jackson became political allies.
Jackson was elected to the state senate in 1848. As leader of the pro-slavery Democrats, he headed efforts to defeat US Senator Thomas H. Benton, a powerful politician who was pro-Union. This was an event with both personal and political implications for Jackson, as his father-in-law and Benton had a longtime friendship. Until that time, like his father-in-law and brother-in-law Marmaduke, Jackson had been an ardent backer of Benton.

Marmaduke chose to side with Benton, as his views on slavery and related issues had changed since the 1840s. This likely cost him the chance to be elected governor in his own right (he had served ten months in the role to fill the term following the suicide of Thomas Reynolds.) The estrangement with Jackson and his other in-laws led to disruption in the extended family.

Amidst increasing tensions related to slavery in the state and nation, Missouri State Senator and Judge Carty Wells of Marion County introduced what were first known as the Calhoun resolutions, developed by US Senator John C. Calhoun (D-SC) for all slaveholding states. These were referred to the committee on foreign relations, which Jackson chaired. He is credited with introducing them to the whole state senate on January 15, 1849. They were afterward known as the &quot;Jackson Resolutions.&quot; Asserting that Congress had no constitutional right to legislate on slavery in the states, the resolutions rejected the Missouri Compromise and any effort by outside forces to determine slavery in a territory, but said to preserve harmony it would accept extension of the Compromise to all new territories. It stated that Missouri had much in common with other slaveholding states and needed to resist Northern encroachment. It mandated that the state&#x27;s U.S. Senators and Congressmen support these resolutions. US Senator Thomas Hart Benton had rejected Calhoun&#x27;s resolutions in the Senate and strongly opposed the effort to introduce them at the state. But Jackson and the anti-Benton faction had their way. The joint convention of the legislature to vote for US Senator (as was the custom at the time) voted for Whig Henry S. Geyer, and Benton lost his office. Benton supporters retaliated by derailing Jackson&#x27;s attempts to secure the Democratic nomination for U.S. Congress in 1853 and again in 1855.

In 1857, Jackson was appointed by the governor as Banking Commissioner of Missouri. In that position he established a system of six State Banks, with branch locations. This proved an advantage to business and the general public alike by stabilizing temporary currency shortages that had happened from time to time, especially in the more rural areas of the state. As Commissioner, Jackson traveled to various locations around the state inspecting banking facilities. He used these occasions to build a power base for his next attempt at elected office, as a candidate for Governor of Missouri.

=== Governor of Missouri ===

In the fall of 1860 Jackson resigned as Banking Commissioner to run for governor. Jackson campaigned, and was elected as, a Douglas Democrat, supporting presidential candidate Stephen A. Douglas&#x27;s anti-secession platform. Jackson defeated his nearest challenger, Sample Orr, by nearly ten thousand votes. Immediately after his election, however, Jackson began working behind the scenes for Missouri&#x27;s secession. Jackson assumed the governor&#x27;s office on January 3, 1861. During his inaugural address, he declared that Missouri shared a common bond and interest with other states that allowed slavery and could not separate herself from them if the Union should be dissolved. He called for a state convention to decide the issue.

On February 18, Missourians voted to have a special state convention to decide on secession and other matters. The convention delegates voted overwhelmingly 98–1 against secession, despite lobbying by Jackson. Jackson announced that he would continue the policy of his predecessor, Governor Robert M. Stewart, whereby Missouri would be an &quot;armed neutral.&quot; The state would refuse to provide arms or men to either side in the approaching Civil War.

After the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter in South Carolina on April 12–13, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation for the states to call up their militia and provide 75,000 troops to the Federal government to suppress the rebellion. He sent specific requests to all states, including Missouri.

Jackson responded,
In this period, Jackson was carrying on secret correspondence with Confederate President Jefferson Davis, making plans to take Missouri out of the Union by a military coup. The key asset was the U.S. Arsenal in St. Louis, which contained large stocks of arms and ammunition. Jackson plotted to seize the Arsenal, and asked Davis to send artillery to breach the Arsenal&#x27;s walls.

The commander of the Arsenal was Captain Nathaniel Lyon, a pro-Union regular Army officer. On April 26, 1861, under orders from Secretary of War Simon Cameron, Lyon worked with Missouri Volunteers and Illinois troops to secretly move 21,000 weapons (of 39,000 small arms held in the Arsenal) across the Mississippi River to Alton, Illinois, in order to protect them.

=== Capture of Camp Jackson ===

On May 3, 1861, Jackson ordered the Missouri Volunteer Militia to assemble at various encampments throughout Missouri, including St. Louis, for six days of training. They assembled in Lindell&#x27;s Grove on the city&#x27;s western outskirts, in an encampment now called Camp Jackson. Governor Jackson&#x27;s order to assemble the militia was legal according to the Missouri state constitution, if the encampment was intended only for training, and not for offensive action against Federal forces. But, the St. Louis Militia was commanded largely by secessionists, and had recently enlisted a new regiment (2nd Regiment MVM) composed almost completely of secessionists. Also, Confederates had shipped artillery seized from the U.S. Arsenal in Baton Rouge. Arriving by steamboat, the artillery was secretly delivered to Camp Jackson.

Lyon responded to the perceived threat to control of the Arsenal with force. On May 10, 1861, Lyon surrounded Camp Jackson with pro-Union volunteer &quot;Home Guards&quot; (mostly drawn from the German immigrants of St. Louis), and took the Militia prisoner. As the prisoners were marched to the Arsenal, a riot broke out on the streets. During two days of rioting and gunfire, several soldiers, prisoners, and civilian bystanders were killed. Alarmed by the incident, the Missouri Legislature immediately acted on Governor Jackson&#x27;s call for a bill dividing the state into military districts and authorizing a State Guard.

=== American Civil War ===

On May 11, 1861, Jackson appointed Sterling Price to be Major General of the Missouri State Guard; he ordered him to resist action by federal forces and Missouri Unionist Volunteers in Federal service. On May 12, Price met with General William S. Harney, the Federal commander in Missouri. They agreed to the Price-Harney Truce, which permitted Missouri to remain neutral for the moment.

Theoretically, Price promised that the state forces, and the state government, would hold the state for the Union and prevent the entry of Confederate forces. But, at the same time Governor Jackson had secretly dispatched envoys to CSA President Jefferson Davis and Confederate commanders in Arkansas asking for an immediate invasion of the state. He promised that the State Guard would cooperate with the Confederate Army in a campaign against Federal forces to effect the &quot;liberation&quot; of St. Louis. In addition, Lieutenant Governor Thomas C. Reynolds traveled to Richmond, with the agreement of Major General Price, to ask President Davis to order an invasion of the state. Missouri Unionists were dismayed at what they perceived as Harney&#x27;s one-sided adherence to the &quot;truce,&quot; and petitioned for Harney&#x27;s removal from command. Harney was removed on May 30, and temporarily replaced with Lyon. He was promoted from captain to brigadier general of volunteers.

On June 11, 1861, Jackson met with Lyon, hoping to extend the truce, but Lyon refused. Lyon marched on Jefferson City with his forces, entering on June 13. Jackson and other pro-Confederate officials fled to Boonville, Missouri. Union forces routed the State Guard, commanded by Jackson&#x27;s nephew John Sappington Marmaduke, at Boonville on June 17. At Carthage on July 5, Jackson took command of 6,000 State Guardsmen (becoming the second sitting U.S. Governor to lead troops in battle after Isaac Shelby of Kentucky did so during the War of 1812), and drove back a much smaller Union detachment led by Colonel Franz Sigel. But, the Union forces held a dominating position, and Lyon chased Jackson and Price to the far southwest of the state.

== Exile ==

On July 22, 1861, the Missouri State Convention reconvened in Jefferson City. The convention again voted against secession, and on July 31, it declared the governor&#x27;s office vacant. The same day the convention appointed Hamilton R. Gamble, former Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court, as provisional governor. He acted as governor for the remainder of the war.

Jackson did not recognize their actions; on August 5 he issued a proclamation declaring that Missouri was a free republic, and dissolving all ties with the Union. He traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to meet with Confederate President Davis to seek support for General Price&#x27;s militia forces and official recognition by the Confederate government.

On October 28, 1861, in Neosho, Missouri, some secessionist members of the Missouri General Assembly met (with Jackson present) and passed an ordinance of secession. On November 28, 1861, the Confederacy recognized Missouri as its twelfth state, with Jackson as governor. The Neosho group elected senators and representatives to the Confederate Congress. But, Union forces occupied almost all of Missouri at the time, making the recognition and elections moot.

Jackson took refuge in Arkansas with General Price and the Missouri militia. They were soundly defeated by Union forces at the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862. Jackson traveled to southern Arkansas in the spring of 1862 to regroup and meet with other wealthy Missouri secessionists who had fled south. They discussed organizing a new campaign to retake Missouri, but Jackson died of pneumonia and stomach cancer before such actions took place. The invasion was never mounted.

== Death ==
His health grew increasingly poor throughout 1862, Jackson traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, in November of that year for military planning meetings for the aforementioned campaign. On December 6, 1862, Jackson died from pneumonia at age 56 in a Little Rock rooming house, as he had become weakened from stomach cancer.

He was initially denied a burial in Missouri because of having led a secession movement. Jackson was buried in Little Rock&#x27;s Mount Holly Cemetery. Following the end of the Civil War, he was exhumed, and reinterred in the family Sappington Cemetery of his in-laws in Saline County, Missouri. All three of his wives are buried there as well.

In 1967 the cemetery was acquired by the state as part of an effort to recognize the burial places of the state&#x27;s governors. It has been preserved as a State Historic Site. Jackson&#x27;s brother-in-law and governor Meredith Miles Marmaduke also died during the Civil War and was buried here. Their father-in-law, John Sappington, had founded the two-acre cemetery in 1831, and it has 111 plots.

A provisional camp of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Caimito, Panama, was named after Claiborne Jackson.

<text>The harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus), also known as Saddleback Seal or Greenland Seal, is a species of earless seal, or true seal, native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean. Originally in the genus &quot;Phoca&quot; with a number of other species, it was reclassified into the monotypic genus &quot;Pagophilus&quot; in 1844. In Greek, its scientific name translates to &quot;ice-lover from Greenland,&quot; and its taxonomic synonym, &quot;Phoca groenlandica&quot; translates to &quot;Greenlandic seal.&quot; This is the only species in the genus Pagophilus.

==Description==
The mature harp seal has pure black eyes. It has a silver-gray fur covering its body, with black harp or wishbone-shaped markings dorsally, accounting for its common name. Adult harp seals grow to be long and weigh from . The harp seal pup often has a yellow-white coat at birth due to staining from amniotic fluid, but after one to three days, the coat turns white and stays white for 2–3 weeks, until the first molt. Adolescent harp seals have a silver-gray coat spotted with black.

===Physiology===

Harp seals are considered sexually dimorphic, as the males are slightly larger, and more decorated. Males weigh an average of , and reach a length up to , while females weigh an average of and reach up to . Males generally have a more defined dorsal harp marking and a darker head, while some females never develop the marking and remain spotted.

===Diving===
Compared to other phocid seals, the harp seal dives from shallow to moderately deep depths. Dive depth varies with season, time of day and location. In the Greenland Sea sub-population, the average dive rate is around 8.3 dives per hour and dives range from a depth of less than 20 to over 500 m. Dive duration ranges from less than two minutes to just over 20 minutes. During the spring and summer when seals forage along the pack ice in the Greenland Sea, most dives are less than 50 m. In the late fall and winter, dive depth has been found to increase, particularly in the Denmark Strait, where the mean dive depth was found to be 141 m.

Lactating female harp seals spend about 80% of the time in the water and 20% of the time on the fast ice weaning or near their pups. However, almost half of the time spent in the water is at the surface, well beyond what is expected to recover from dives. This behavior allows the mother harp seal to conserve energy and avoid the harsh conditions of the fast-ice while remaining near her pup. As with most phocids, she requires vast amounts of energy to ensure sufficient mass transfer to her growing, weaning pup. Harp seals remain within their aerobic dive limit for 99% of dives.

===Thermoregulation===
Harp seal insulation changes over the course of a seal&#x27;s lifetime. Young harp seals rely on a lanugo pelt from nursing all the way up to their weaning age. The insulating quality of this fur depends on its ability to keep a layer of air trapped inside or between the hairs. It takes a year for their blubber to develop and for their first-year pelage to grow. This transition from thick lanugo fur to blubber is important because lanugo fur does not insulate well in water. Adult harp seals primarily use blubber for insulation.

Harp seals combine anatomical and behavioral approaches to managing their body temperatures, instead of elevating their metabolic rate and energy requirements. Their lower critical temperature is believed to be under −10 degrees Celsius in air. Blubber insulates the harp seal&#x27;s core but does not insulate the flippers to the same extent. Instead, the flippers have circulatory adaptations to help prevent heat loss. A thick coat of blubber insulates its body and provides energy when food is scarce or during fasting. Blubber also streamlines its body for more efficient swimming. Brown fat warms blood as it returns from the body surface as well as providing energy, most importantly for newly weaned pups.

Flippers act as heat exchangers, warming or cooling the seal as needed. On ice, the seal can press its fore flippers to its body and its hind flippers together to reduce heat loss. They can also redirect blood flow from the periphery to minimize heat loss.

===Senses===
The harp seal&#x27;s eyes are large for its body size and contain a large spherical lens that improves focusing ability. Its mobile pupil helps it adapt to the intense glare of the Arctic ice. Its retina is rod-dominated and backed by a cat-like and reflective tapetum lucidum, enhancing its low light sensitivity. Its cones are most sensitive to blue-green spectra, while its rods help sense light intensity and may provide some color discrimination. Its cornea is lubricated by lacrimal glands, to protect the eye from sea water damage. The lack of tear ducts to drain secretions to the nasal passages contribute to the harp seals &quot;eye rings&quot; on land. This can be an indication of the hydration level of the seal.

On ice, the mother identifies her offspring by smell. This sense may also warn of an approaching predator. Underwater, the seal closes its nostrils, disabling its sense of smell.

Its whiskers, called vibrissae, lie in horizontal rows on either side of its snout. They provide a touch sense with labeled line coding, and underwater, also respond to low-frequency vibrations, such as movement.

=== Diet ===
Like most pinnipeds, harp seals are carnivorous. They have a diverse diet including several dozen fish and invertebrate species. The White Sea population migrates northward in the summer to forage extensively in the Barents Sea. Where common prey items include krill, capelin (&quot;Mallotus villosus),&quot; herring (&quot;Clupea harengus),&quot; flat fish and Gadiform fish. Harp seals prefer some prey, though their diet depends largely on prey abundance. Diet and abundance analysis of the Svalbard population found that this population predominantly eats krill, followed closely by polar cod (&quot;Arctogladus glacialis)&quot;. Some individuals from the Greenland Sea sub-population have foraged in the Barents Sea alongside the White Sea sub-population during late summer and fall. Barents Sea harp seals eat mostly herring and polar cod but less krill or amphipods, likely because these seals usually dive deeper than such prey. 
Western North Atlantic harp seals forage both near and offshore of Newfoundland, most preferring such prey as Arctic cod (&quot;Boreogadus saida)&quot;, capelin, Greenland halibut (&quot;Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)&quot; and American plaice (&quot;Hippoglossoides platessoides&quot;). As in other populations and foraging areas, diet varies with distance from shore, with arctic cod comprising more of it nearshore and capelin more of it offshore. However, capelin is the preferred prey in both locales.

==Life history==
Harp seals spend relatively little time on land compared with time at sea. They are social animals and can be quite vocal in groups. Within their large colonies, smaller groups with their own hierarchies form. Groups of several thousand form during pupping and mating season. Harp seals can live over 30 years in the wild.
On the ice, pups call their mothers by &quot;yelling,&quot; and &quot;mumble&quot; while playing with others. Adults &quot;growl&quot; and &quot;warble&quot; to warn off conspecifics and predators. Underwater, adults have been recorded using more than 19 types of vocalization during courting and mating.

===Reproduction and development===
The harp seal is a fast ice breeder and is believed to have a promiscuous mating system. Breeding occurs between mid-February and April. Courtship peaks during mid-March and involves males performing underwater displays, using bubbles, vocalizations, and paw movements to court females. Females, who remain on the ice, will resist copulation unless underwater.

Females mature sexually between ages five to six. Annually thereafter, they may bear one pup, usually in late February. The gestation period lasts about 11.5 months, with a fetal development phase of 8 months. There have been reported cases of twin births, but singletons are vastly more common. The fertilized egg grows into an embryo which remains suspended in the womb for up to three months before implantation, to delay birth until sufficient pack ice is available.

Harp seal births are rapid, with recorded lengths as short as 15 seconds in duration. In order to cope with the shock of a rapid change in environmental temperature and undeveloped blubber layers, the pup relies on solar heating, and behavioral responses such as shivering or seeking warmth in the shade or even water.

Newborn pups weigh on average and are long. After birth, the mother feeds only her own pup. During the approximately 12-day long nursing period, the mother does not hunt, and loses up to per day. Harp seal milk initially contains 25% fat (this number increases to 40% by weaning as the mother fasts) and pups gain over per day while nursing, quickly thickening their blubber layer. During this time, the juvenile&#x27;s &quot;greycoat&quot; grows in beneath the white neonatal coat, and the pup increases its weight to . Weaning is abrupt; the mother turns from nursing to promiscuous mating, leaving the pup behind on the ice. While courtship starts on the ice, mating usually takes place in the water.
After abandonment, in the post-weaning phase, the pup becomes sedentary to conserve body fat. Within a few days, it sheds its white coat, reaching the &quot;beater&quot; stage. This name comes from the sound a beater&#x27;s tail makes as the seal learns to swim. Pups begin to feed at 4 weeks of age, but still draw on internal sources of energy, relying first on energy stored in the body core rather than blubber. During this time the ice begins to melt leaving them vulnerable to polar bears and other predators including killer whales and large sharks. This fast can reduce their weight up to 50%. As many as 30% of pups die during their first year, due in part to their early immobility on land.

Around 13–14 months old, the pups molt again, becoming &quot;bedlamers&quot;. Juveniles molt several times, producing a &quot;spotted harp&quot;, before the male adults&#x27; harp-marked pelt fully emerges after several years. In females, it does not emerge.

Seals congregate annually on the ice to molt, pup and breed before migrating to summer feeding grounds. Their lifespan can be over 30 years.

==Distribution==
Global harp seal population estimates total around 4.5 million individuals. The number of pups born in the traditional pupping area of the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence was greatly reduced, with an estimated pup production of only 18,300 (95% CI, 15,400-21,200 rounded to the nearest hundred). Another 13,600 (95% CI, 7,700-19,500) pups were born in the northern Gulf. An estimated 714,600 (95% CI, 538,800-890,400) pups were born off the northeastern coast of Newfoundland (Front); accounting for 96% of all pupping in 2017. Combining the estimates from all areas resulted in an estimated total pup production of 746,500 (95% CI, 570,300-922,700). Due to their dependence on pack ice for breeding, the harp seal range is restricted to areas where pack ice forms seasonally. The western North Atlantic stock, which is the largest, is located off eastern Canada. This population is further divided into two separate herds based on the breeding location. The Front herd breeds off the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland, and the Gulf herd breeds near the Magdalen Islands in the middle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A second stock breeds on the &quot;West Ice&quot; off eastern Greenland. A third stock breeds on the &quot;East Ice&quot; in the White Sea, which is off the north coast of Russia below the Barents ea. Breeding occurs between mid-February and April, and varies somewhat for each stock. The three stocks are allopatric and do not interbreed.

There are two recognised subspecies:
===Migration and vagrancy===
Harp seals are strongly , the northwest population regularly moves up to northeast outside of the breeding season; one individual was located off the north Norwegian coast, east northeast of its tagging location. Their navigational accuracy is high, with good eyesight an important factor. They are occasionally found as vagrants, south of their normal range. In Great Britain, a total of 31 vagrants were recorded between 1800 and 1988.

More recently, they reached Lindisfarne in Northumberland in September 1995, and the Shetland Islands in 1987. The latter was linked to a mass movement of harp seals into Norwegian waters; by mid-February 1987, 24,000 were reported drowned in fishing nets and perhaps 30,000 (about 10% of the world population) had invaded fjords as far south as Oslo. The animals were emaciated, likely due to commercial fishing causing competition for the seals&#x27; prey.

Harp seals can strand on Atlantic coasts, often in warmer months, due to dehydration and parasite load. In March 2020, a harp seal was spotted near Salvo, North Carolina. Harp seals often consume snow to stay hydrated, but in mild winters may not have enough available. Several centers are active in seal rescue and rehabilitation, including IFAW, NOAA, and the New England Aquarium. Harp seals are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States.

===Seal hunting===
All three populations are hunted commercially, mainly by Canada, Norway, Russia and Greenland.

In Canada, commercial hunting season is from November 15 to May 15. Most sealing occurs in late March in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and during the first or second week of April off Newfoundland, in an area known as &quot;the Front&quot;. This peak spring period is generally what is referred to as the &quot;Canadian seal hunt&quot;. Hunting Canadian whitecoats has been banned since 1987. Since 2000, harp seals that are targeted during the hunt are often found to be less than a year old, known as &quot;beaters&quot;. In 2006, the St. Lawrence hunt officially started on March 25 due to thin ice caused by the year&#x27;s milder temperatures. Inuit living in the region hunt mainly for food and, to a lesser extent, commerce.

In 2019, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans estimated sustainable harvest levels for the next five years. The identified annual Canadian Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels were 425,000 assuming harvest age structures of 95% young of the year (YOY). In 2016, 66,800 harp seals and 1,612 grey seals were harvested in Atlantic Canada.

In 2005, the Independent Veterinarians&#x27; Working Group (IVWG) recommended a three-step process for hunters to kill the seals with little or no pain for the seals, as long as the process is completed in rapid succession. The process is as follows:

# Stun the seal on the head using tools, such as a rifle or a club, to immediately kill the animal or cause it to permanently lose consciousness.
# Ensure that step 1 was completed correctly, and the skull is irreversibly damaged.
# Cut the axillary arteries along both armpits and cut along the belly to prevent blood from reaching the brain, confirming its death.

In 2009, this process was included in both the &#x27;Conditions of License&#x27; for the Canadian hunt as well as the Canadian Marine Mammal Regulations.

The Canadian seal hunt is monitored by the Canadian government. Although approximately 70% of the hunt occurs on &quot;the Front&quot;, most private monitors focus on the St. Lawrence hunt, due to its more convenient location.

The annual quota off the coast of Greenland for 2017–2019 was set at 26,000 1+ animals, where two pups are equivalent to removing one 1+ animal. The total catches of harp seals were 2000 (including 1934 pups) in 2017, 2703 (including 1218 pups) in 2018, and 5813 (including 2168 pups) in 2019.

The 2004 West Ice total allowable catch (TAC) was 15,000, almost double the sustainable catch of 8,200. Actual catches were 9,895 in 2004 and 5,808 in 2005. The 2004 White Sea TAC was 45,000. The catch was 22,474.

=== Population dynamics ===
Hunting has tremendously affected the population size of harp seals. Over the past 150 years, the harp seal population has fluctuated from over 9 million to as little as 1 million. The current population is estimated to be around 4.5 million or less. The Northwest Atlantic populations was found to have decreased by at least 50 percent from 1952 to 1970 but nowadays, seal populations all are hunted under quotas and other restrictions.
