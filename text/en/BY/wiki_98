<text>Acheson Gosford Irvine, ISO (December 7, 1837 – January 8, 1916) served as Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) from November 1, 1880, to March 31, 1886.

Irvine was born in Lower Canada in 1837, the son of John George Irvine, a captain in the Royal Quebec volunteers. Acheson became Assistant Commissioner of the North-West Mounted Police in 1876, and was promoted to commissioner in 1880.

Irvine was involved with the events of the North-West Rebellion of 1885. On March 17, 1885, Irvine received a telegraph from Superintendent Leif Crozier that there was trouble near Fort Carlton and reinforcements were required. On March 18, Irvine left Regina, Assiniboia, with 100 men, arriving in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, on March 25. On March 26, Irvine set out for Fort Carlton with 83 police and 25 civilian volunteers. Shortly before his arrival there, a skirmish took place at Duck Lake, outside Batoche, between the existing NWMP forces, led by Crozier, and a group of Métis and Indians led by Gabriel Dumont, with the NWMP coming off worst. On March 27, the day after his arrival, Irvine concluded that Fort Carlton was indefensible and pulled the troops out, returning to Prince Albert. The troops returned to Prince Albert unharmed, but Fort Carlton burnt to the ground during the evacuation. Irvine was publicly censured by General Middleton for not attacking Batoche.

Acheson Irvine also served as a member of the executive council of the North-West Territories from 1882 to 1886. Following his retirement in 1886, he became warden of the Stony Mountain Penitentiary in Manitoba. He was awarded the Imperial Service Order in 1902.

In 1945, an RCMP Commissioner-Class ship was named after him. The patrol vessel &quot;Irvine&quot; (originally named HMCS &quot;Noranda&quot;) had started off life as a Bangor-class minesweeper in the Royal Canadian Navy. In 1962 the RCMP sold the ship, which was converted to a yacht, the &quot;Miriana&quot;; she sank at Montego Bay, Jamaica in May 1971.

<text>High-Level Assembly (HLA) is a language developed by Randall Hyde that allows the use of higher-level language constructs to aid both beginners and advanced assembly developers. It supports advanced data types and object-oriented programming. It uses a syntax loosely based on several high-level programming languages (HLLs), such as Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, and C++, to allow the creation of readable assembly language programs, and to allow HLL programmers to learn HLA as fast as possible.

== Origins and Goals ==

HLA was originally conceived as a tool to teach assembly language programming at the college-university level. The goal is to leverage students&#x27; existing programming knowledge when learning assembly language to get them up to speed as fast as possible. Most students taking an assembly language programming course have already been introduced to high-level control flow structures, such as IF, WHILE, FOR, etc. HLA allows students to immediately apply that programming knowledge to assembly language coding early in their course, allowing them to master other prerequisite subjects in assembly before learning how to code low-level forms of these control structures. The book &quot;The Art of Assembly Language Programming&quot; by Randall Hyde uses HLA for this purpose.

== High vs. low-level assembler ==

The HLA v2.x assembler supports the same low-level machine instructions as a regular low-level assembler, while high-end assemblers also support high-level-language-like statements, such as IF, WHILE, and so on, and fancier data declaration directives such as structures-records, unions, and even classes.

Some examples of high-end assemblers are HLA, Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), and the Turbo Assembler (TASM) on the Intel x86 processor family, 

Unlike most other assembler tools, the HLA compiler includes a &quot;Standard Library&quot; with thousands of functions, procedures, and macros that can be used to create full applications with the ease of a high-level language. While assembly language libraries are not new, a language that includes a large standardized library encourages programmers to use the library code rather than simply writing their own library functions.

HLA supports all the same low-level machine instructions as other x86 assemblers. Furthermore, HLA&#x27;s high-level control structures are based on the ones found in MASM and TASM, which HLL-like features predated the arrival of HLA by several years. In HLA, low-level assembly code can be written as easily as with any other assembler by simply ignoring the HLL-control constructs. In contrast to HLLs like Pascal and C(++), HLA doesn&#x27;t require inline asm statements. In HLA, HLL-like features appear to provide a learning aid for beginning assembly programmers by smoothing the learning curve, with the assumption that they will discontinue the use of those statements once they master the low-level instruction set. In practice, many experienced programmers continue to use HLL-like statements in HLA, MASM, and TASM, long after mastering the low-level instruction set, but this is usually done to improve readability.

It is also possible to write &quot;high-level&quot; programs using HLA, avoiding much of the tedium of low-level assembly language programming. Some assembly language programmers reject HLA out of hand, because it allows programmers to do this. However, supporting both high-level and low-level programming gives any language an expanded range of applicability. 

== Distinguishing features ==

Two HLA features set it apart from other x86 assemblers: its powerful macro system (compile-time language) and the HLA Standard Library.

=== Macro system ===

HLA&#x27;s compile-time language allows extending the language with ease, even creating small domain-specific languages to help easily solve common programming problems. The macro codice_1 is a good example of a sophisticated macro that can simplify programming. Consider the following invocation of that macro:

codice_2

The stdout.put macro processes each of the arguments to determine the argument&#x27;s type and then calls an appropriate procedure in the HLA Standard library to handle the output of each of these operands.

Most assemblers provide some sort of macro ability: the advantage that HLA offers over other assemblers is that it can process macro arguments like codice_3 using HLA&#x27;s extensive compile-time string functions, and HLA&#x27;s macro facilities can infer the types of variables and use that information to direct macro expansion.

HLA&#x27;s macro language provides a special &quot;Context-Free&quot; macro facility. This feature allows easily writing macros that span other sections of code via a &quot;starting&quot; and &quot;terminating&quot; macro pair (along with optional &quot;intermediate&quot; macro invocations that are only available between the start–terminate macros). For example, one can write a fully recursive-nestable SWITCH–CASE–DEFAULT–ENDSWITCH statement using this macro facility.

Because of the HLA macro facilities context-free design, these switch..case..default..endswitch statements can be nested, and the nested statements&#x27; emitted code will not conflict with the outside statements.

=== Compile-Time Language ===

The HLA macro system is actually a subset of a larger feature known as the HLA &quot;Compile-Time Language&quot; (CTL). The HLA CTL is an interpreted language that is available in an HLA program source file. An interpreter executes HLA CTL statements during the compiling of an HLA source file; hence the name &quot;compile-time language&quot;.

The HLA CTL includes many control statements such as #IF, #WHILE, #FOR, #PRINT, an assignment statement and so on. One can also create compile-time variables and constants (including structured data types such as records and unions). The HLA CTL also provides hundreds of built-in functions (including a very rich set of string and pattern-matching functions). The HLA CTL allows programmers to create CTL &quot;programs&quot; that scan and parse strings, allowing those programmers to create &quot;embedded domain-specific languages&quot; (EDSLs, also termed &quot;mini-languages&quot;). The codice_1 macro appearing earlier is an example of such an EDSL. The put macro (in the stdout namespace, hence the name &quot;stdout&quot;.put) parses its macro parameter list and emits the code that will print its operands.

=== Standard library ===

The HLA Standard Library is an extensive set of pre-made routines and macros (like the stdout.put macro described above) that make life easier for programmers, saving them from starting from scratch every time they write a new application. Perhaps just as important, the HLA Standard Library allows programmers to write portable applications that run under Windows or Linux with nothing more than recompiling the source code. Like the C standard library for the programming language C, the HLA Standard Library allows users to abstract away low-level operating system (OS) calls, so the same set of OS application programming interfaces (APIs) can serve for all operating systems that HLA supports. While an assembly language allows making any needed OS calls, where programs use the HLA Standard Library API set, writing OS-portable programs is easy.

The HLA Standard Library provides thousands of functions, procedures, and macros. While the list changes over time, as of mid-2010 for HLA v2.12, it included functions in these categories:

* Command-line argument processing
* Array (dynamic) declaration and manipulation
* Bit manipulation
* Blob (binary large object) manipulation
* Character manipulation
* Conversions
* Character set manipulation
* Date and time functions
* Object-oriented file I/O
* Standard file I/O
* File system manipulation functions, e.g., delete, rename, change directory
* HLA-related declarations and functions
* The HLA Object Windows Library: object-oriented framework for Win32 programming
* Linked list manipulation
* Mathematical functions
* Memory allocation and management
* FreeBSD-specific APIs
* Linux-specific APIs
* MacOS-specific APIs
* Win32-specific APIs
* Text console functions
* Coroutine support
* Environment variable support
* Exception handling support
* Memory-mapped file support
* Sockets and client–server object support
* Thread and synchronization support
* Timer functions
* Pattern matching support for regular expressions and context-free languages
* Random number generators
* Remote procedure call support
* Standard error output functions
* Standard output functions
* Standard input functions
* String functions
* Table (associative) support
* Zero-terminated string functions

=== Design ===

The HLA v2.x language system is a command-line driven tool that consists of several components, including a &quot;shell&quot; program (e.g., hla.exe under Windows), the HLA language compiler (e.g., hlaparse.exe), a low-level translator (e.g., the HLABE, or HLA Back Engine), a linker (link.exe under Windows, ld under Linux), and other tools such as a resource compiler for Windows. Versions before 2.0 relied on an external assembler back end; versions 2.x and later of HLA use the built-in HLABE as the back-end object code formatter.

The HLA &quot;shell&quot; application processes command line parameters and routes appropriate files to each of the programs that make up the HLA system. It accepts as input codice_5 files (HLA source files), codice_6 files (source files for MASM, TASM, FASM, NASM, or Gas assemblers), codice_7 files for input to the linker, and codice_8 files (for use by a resource compiler).

=== Source code translation ===

Originally, the HLA v1.x tool compiled its source code into an intermediate source file that a &quot;back-end&quot; assembler such as MASM, TASM, flat assembler (FASM), Netwide Assembler (NASM), or GNU Assembler (Gas) would translate into the low-level object code file. As of HLA v2.0, HLA included its own &quot;HLA Back Engine&quot; (HLABE) that provided the low-level object code translation. However, via various command-line parameters, HLA v2.x still has the ability to translate an HLA source file into a source file that is compatible with one of these other assemblers.

=== HLA Back Engine ===

The HLA Back Engine (HLABE) is a compiler back end that translates an internal intermediate language into low-level Portable Executable (PE), Common Object File Format (COFF), Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), or Mach-O object code. An HLABE &quot;program&quot; mostly consists of data (byte) emission statements, 32-bit relocatable address statements, x86 control-transfer instructions, and various directives. In addition to translating the byte and relocatable address statements into the low-level object code format, HLABE also handles branch-displacement optimization (picking the shortest possible form of a branch instruction).

Although the HLABE is incorporated into the HLA v2.x compiler, it is actually a separate product. It is public domain and open source (hosted on SourceForge.net).

<doc id="723582" wikidata="Q961039" url="?curid=723582" title="The Story of Robin Hood (film)">
<text>The Story of Robin Hood and his Merrie Men is a 1952 action-adventure film produced by RKO-Walt Disney British Productions, based on the Robin Hood legend, made in Technicolor and filmed in Buckinghamshire, England. It was written by Lawrence Edward Watkin and directed by Ken Annakin. It is the second of Disney&#x27;s complete live-action films, after &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950), and the first of four films Annakin directed for Disney. It was also the first of three films Todd made for the studio.

== Plot ==
Young Robin Hood, in love with Maid Marian, enters an archery contest with his father at the King&#x27;s palace. On the way home his father is killed by henchmen of Prince John. Robin takes up the life of an outlaw, gathering together his band of merry men with him in Sherwood Forest, to avenge his father&#x27;s death and to help the people of the land whom Prince John is over taxing.

==Cast==

* Richard Todd as Robin Hood
* Joan Rice as Maid Marian
* Peter Finch as the Sheriff of Nottingham
* James Hayter as Friar Tuck
* James Robertson Justice as Little John
* Martita Hunt as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine
* Hubert Gregg as Prince John
* Elton Hayes as Alan-a-Dale
* Anthony Eustrel as the Archbishop of Canterbury
* Patrick Barr as King Richard
* Anthony Forwood as Will Scarlet
* Bill Owen as Will Stutely
* Hal Osmond as Much the Miller
* Louise Hampton as Tyb, aged nurse of Maid Marian
* Richard Graydon as Merrie Man
* Michael Hordern as Scathelock
* Bill Travers as Possie Man
* Clement McCallin as The Earl of Huntingdon
* Nigel Neilson as Merrie Man
* Geoffrey Lumsden as Merrie Man
* Julian Somers as Posse Leader
* Leonard Charles Newcombe as a Page Boy to Maid Marian
==Production==
The idea to make the film was Walt Disney&#x27;s. He wanted to use colour, use a more historically accurate script than in most previous Robin Hood films, and to shoot on location in Sherwood Forest. Ken Annakin was loaned out from J. Arthur Rank Films, to whom he was under contract, to make the film.

Annakin says the entire film was storyboarded in advance by Carmen Dillon and Guy Green, so as to ensure Walt Disney to keep creative control, adding &quot;quite often I had to bite my tongue or be prepared to quit&quot;, but Annakin soon earned Disney&#x27;s respect and the two men went on to make several films together.

Production began in April 1951 at Denham Film Studios in London. This was the second film Disney made in the United Kingdom, the first being &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1950). These and several other Disney films were made using British funds frozen during World War II. Originally Bobby Driscoll was going to be featured in the film as a boy in Robin&#x27;s camp, but he was unable to appear in the film because he had violated British labour laws with his appearance in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. In Driscoll&#x27;s absence, the story was rewritten to focus on the romantic relationship between Robin Hood and Maid Marian. Robert Newton, who was originally cast as Friar Tuck, had to be recast with James Hayter after he was cast in &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot;. &quot;The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men&quot; was filmed in 3-strip Technicolor.

Annakin said he was unhappy with the casting of Joan Rice as Maid Marian, feeling she could not act, but says Disney insisted she play the role. Richard Todd was short and often had to walk on a plank or stand on an apple box next to Rice. Annakin said Peter Finch &quot;brought a freshness and a snide threat to the villainous character, without the histrionics of his predecessors in the role. We became great friends and over the years I was sad to see how the strain of show business made Peter hit the bottle.&quot;

==Release==
The world premiere was in London on March 13, 1952. Annakin called it &quot;a happy, triumphant evening. My only private reservation was that despite my efforts to shake off the strait-jacket of the continuity sketches, some of the acting seemed stilted and stagey. I swore that this must never happen on my second Disney movie&quot;.

The film opened in New York on June 26, 1952.

The production was promoted in the short film &quot;The Riddle of Robin Hood&quot;.

The film was one of the most popular in Britain in 1952, and would eventually gross over $4,578,000 at the American box office.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an expert rendition of an ancient legend that is as pretty as its Technicolor hues and as lively as a sturdy Western... (T)he action - the courtly speeches and romance are kept to a sensible minimum - is robust and fairly continuous&quot;; and Leonard Maltin similarly noted a &quot;zesty, colorful retelling of the familiar story, filmed in England by Walt Disney with excellent cast. Not as personality oriented as other versions, but just as good in its own way&quot;; and the &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote: &quot;This may not hold a candle to the Errol Flynn version, but the authentic English locations and fine Technicolor photography make it excellent family entertainment. Richard Todd enjoys himself as the famous outlaw, but is up against strong competition from Peter Finch as the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham and the delightful Hubert Gregg, cast against type as the evil King John.&quot;

==Home media==
A Laserdisc was released in 1992, a VHS tape was released in 1994 (the Walt Disney&#x27;s Studio Film Collection) and a limited Disney Movie Club DVD was released in July 2006. All releases are 1.33:1 fullscreen in monaural (as shot).

A Disneyland Records LP of four songs from the soundtrack with narration by Dallas McKennon was released in 1963.

<doc id="723587" wikidata="Q1230084" url="?curid=723587" title="Martin Callanan, Baron Callanan">
<text>Martin John Callanan, Baron Callanan (born 8 August 1961) is a British Conservative Party politician. He was Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for North East England from 1999 to 2014 and Chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists group from 2011 to 2014. Callanan failed his bid to win re-election in the 2014 European Parliament elections, becoming the first sitting chairman of a European parliamentary group to lose his seat. On 8 August 2014, it was announced that he would be made a Conservative life peer in the House of Lords.

Following the 2017 general election, Callanan was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport. In October the same year, he was appointed Minister of State for Exiting the European Union.

==Early life==
Callanan was born on 8 August 1961 in Gateshead. In 1985, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree (BSc) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Newcastle Polytechnic. He worked as an engineer at Scottish and Newcastle breweries from 1986 to 1998.

==Political career==

===Local councillor===
Callanan was a Conservative councillor on Tyne and Wear County Council between 1983 and 1986 (when the council was abolished) and Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council between 1987 and 1996, for the Low Fell ward. He worked as a project engineer at Scottish and Newcastle breweries from 1986 to 1998, when he was elected to the European Parliament.

He unsuccessfully stood as a parliamentary candidate for Washington (in the 1987 election), Gateshead East (in the 1992 election), and Tynemouth (in the 1997 election).

===Member of European Parliament===
He was a Member of the European Parliament for the North East England constituency from 1999, re-elected in 2004 and 2009. In December 2011, he became the leader of the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the Parliament; as a leader of a parliamentary group, he had a seat in the political leadership of the European Parliament, the Conference of Presidents.

He was a member of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and of the European Parliament&#x27;s committee on the environment, public health and food safety (ENVI). Callanan was a regular contributor to ConservativeHome, writing a monthly report.

Callanan failed to win re-election in the 2014 European Parliament election, becoming the first sitting chairman of a European parliamentary group to lose his seat.

=== Peer and government minister ===
Callanan was created a life peer on 24 September 2014, taking the title Baron Callanan, of Low Fell in the County of Tyne and Wear.

Following the 2017 general election, Callanan was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport. In the role he introduced the Space Industry Bill.

In October the same year he was appointed Minister of State for Exiting the European Union. The following month he was obliged to apologise for incorrectly stating in the Lords that the Supreme Court had ruled Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union was irreversible.

Callanan was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the newly created Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, on 7 February 2023, following a Cabinet reshuffle.

He piloted many significant Bills through the Lords, including the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023, the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023 and the landmark Energy Bill, which is still in Parliament.

<doc id="723595" wikidata="Q8055558" url="?curid=723595" title="York Steak House">
<text>York Steak House was a national chain of steakhouse restaurants in the United States. It was among several chains owned at the time by cereal manufacturer General Mills. By 1982, there were nearly 200 restaurants in 27 states from Texas to Maine. Though popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the majority of its locations shut down in 1989.

The fate of the rest of the chain after 1989 still remains unclear. One source reported that the remaining York Steak House chain was eventually purchased by Uno Restaurant Holdings Corporation while other sources reported that the remaining York Steak House chain was sold in 1989 to U.S.A. Cafes Inc., a major franchisee of Bonanza Steakhouses, for conversion to the Bonanza brand.

The restaurants, located primarily in shopping malls, generally had a floorplan of a cafeteria: cold items on one side, hot items on the other, with the cashier at the end. The decor was composed of subdued lighting, heavy wooden furniture, and iron chandeliers.

The restaurants were run cafeteria style, with a-la-carte pricing of items. Tipping was not allowed at any of its restaurants. There was an extra charge for pats of butter and sour cream.

==History==
The first York Steak House was opened in 1966 by Eddie Grayson and Bernie Gros in Columbus, Ohio. The second unit of the chain was built and operated by Grayson&#x27;s brother Howard inside the Maine Mall in South Portland, Maine, when the mall first opened in 1971.

In April 1977, York Steak House was purchased by General Mills. At the time of the acquisition, York had 47 units. Another source claimed that York had 150 at the time of its sale to General Mills.

In the early 1980s, many of the York Steak House locations were converted into a new concept called York&#x27;s Choices, which featured a round bakery case/kiosk that sold its signature cakes and pies at the front of the store.

Although it is not very clear when General Mills disposed of the York Steak House chain, it is known that York Steak House was not part of General Mills&#x27; portfolio of restaurant chains when Darden Restaurants was spun off in 1995.

After General Mills sold the chain, a limited number of York Steak Houses continued to operate for several years as independent restaurants. As of 2017, only one restaurant is known to remain in operation using the York name, in Columbus, Ohio, near the now-demolished Westland Mall. This location became an independently-owned franchised operation in 1989. It largely retains the signature look and cafeteria-style format of the former chain.

<doc id="723599" wikidata="Q810869" url="?curid=723599" title="Batoche, Saskatchewan">
<text>Batoche, Saskatchewan, which lies between Prince Albert and Saskatoon, was the site of the historic Battle of Batoche during the North-West Rebellion of 1885. The battle resulted in the defeat of Louis Riel and his Métis forces by Major General Frederick Middleton and his Northwest Field Force. Batoche was then a small village of some 500 residents. The site has since become depopulated and now has few residents. The 1885 church building and a few other historic buildings have been preserved, and the site is a National Historic Site.

== History ==
The Métis settlement of Batoche (named after Xavier Letendre &quot;dit&quot; Batoche) was established in 1872. By 1885 it numbered 500 people. The Métis of the area settled on river lots, and the community contained several stores as well as the Roman Catholic Church of St. Antoine de Padoue at the time of the Rebellion. Batoche was the de facto capital of Riel&#x27;s Provisional Government of Saskatchewan.

Batoche is a Southbranch Settlement. It is situated mainly along the east bank of the South Saskatchewan River between St. Laurent and Fish Creek. This area is part of the aspen parkland biome.

This community consisted mostly of Francophones and Roman Catholics.

== Batoche National Historic Site ==
Batoche was declared a National Historic Site in 1923. The visitor centre features a multimedia presentation about the history of the community and its inhabitants. There are several restored buildings with costumed interpreters who depict the lifestyles of the Métis of Batoche between 1860 and 1900. The sites include a North-West Mounted Police encampment, a church and rectory complex, and a farm home. The sites are set at different locations around the community. The complex is open from mid-May through mid-September.

== In popular culture ==

* In 1989, Ralph D. Witten&#x27;s short story &quot;Batoche&quot; was read on CBC Radio by Wendell Smith

<text>In rhetoric, eunoia () is the good will that speakers cultivate between themselves and their audiences, a condition of receptivity. In Book VIII of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, Aristotle uses the term to refer to the kind and benevolent feelings of good will a spouse has which form the basis for the ethical foundation of human life. Cicero translates with the Latin word .

It is also a rarely used medical term referring to a state of normal mental health. &quot;Eunoia&quot; is the shortest English word containing all five main vowel graphemes.

<doc id="723614" wikidata="Q652908" url="?curid=723614" title="Richard Corbett">
<text>Richard Graham Corbett CBE (born 6 January 1955) is a former British politician who served as the final Leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP), from 2017 to 2020. 

He was for decades one of the leading political and academic participants in the debates over British membership of the EU and of reforming the EU.

He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Merseyside West from 1996 to 1999 (under the system that predated the proportional representation regional system) and then for Yorkshire and the Humber from 1999 to 2009, when he lost his seat, and again from 2014 to 2020. As Labour Leader in the European Parliament, he attended Shadow Cabinet meetings and was a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee, where he played a key role in Labour&#x27;s decision to back a second referendum on Brexit once the actual terms of the Brexit deal were known. 

Between January 2010 and February 2014, Corbett was an advisor to the first full-time and long-term President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy. In this capacity, and as a frequent writer and commentator on European affairs, he was voted by a panel of retired diplomats, journalists, academics and think-tankers on 14 November 2012 as the fourth most influential Briton on EU policy, ahead of the Prime Minister.

In 2003, Corbett became the first MEP to write a regular personal blog, and in 2015 he became the first British politician to develop and release a phone app.

==Education==
Corbett was born in Southport, Lancashire, to parents of working-class background from Wales and London. He attended primary school at Farnborough Road School in Southport. When his father was offered a post as a statistician at the World Health Organization, the family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and Corbett attended the International School of Geneva (attended at the time mostly by children from UN Agencies in Geneva), where he obtained the International Baccalaureate. He was captain of the football team and also played for the junior team of a Swiss second division club.

He won a place at Trinity College, Oxford, the first generation of his family to be able to go to university, and obtained a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He was the Secretary of the Labour Club and chairman of the Oxford Committee for Europe. He co-ordinated the Oxford student &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign in the 1975 referendum on membership of the European Community. He also skied for Oxford against Cambridge.

Corbett later completed a doctorate in political science at the University of Hull.

==Political career==

===Before the European Parliament===
Richard Corbett&#x27;s activities in the European Students at Oxford led on to him being elected first to the youth board of the European Movement in Britain and then to the international presidency of the youth wing of the European Movement and of the Union of European Federalists, the Young European Federalists (JEF), a post he held from 1979 to 1981, drafting their manifesto, which was the first to coin the phrase &quot;democratic deficit&quot; in relation to the European Parliament&#x27;s then lack of power over European legislation.

Corbett was secretary-general of the European Co-ordination Bureau of International Non-Governmental Youth Organisations from 1977 to 1981, representing youth organisations in the Council of Europe&#x27;s European Youth Foundation and European Youth Centre. He also helped to set up the Youth Forum of the European Communities, the predecessor of the European Youth Forum, and represented Western European youth organisations in negotiations with Eastern European organisations pursuant to the Helsinki Treaty (as well as at the World Festival of Youth and Students in Havana in 1978, along with Charles Clarke and Peter Mandelson). He worked with Altiero Spinelli MEP on the latter&#x27;s proposal for a draft treaty establishing a European Union, adopted by the European Parliament in 1984.

Before being elected to the European Parliament, Corbett worked in the voluntary sector and as a civil servant, later becoming a policy advisor to and then Deputy Secretary General of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. He worked on drafting the parts of the treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam that increased the powers of the Parliament, notably helping to draft the &quot;codecision procedure&quot; which now applies for adopting European legislation through successive readings of the Parliament and the Council.

In 1992, Corbett was made Ambassador of Goodwill of the US State of Arkansas, by its then Governor Bill Clinton.

===First Period as a Member of the European Parliament===
Corbett was a member of the Parliament&#x27;s Constitutional Affairs committee and from 1999 to 2009 was the spokesman for the Labour Party, as well as the whole of the wider Group of the Party of European Socialists, on European constitutional affairs. In 2006, he was elected Deputy Leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, which he remained until the end of his first period as an MEP, declining (to some surprise) to challenge for the leadership when Gary Titley stood down in 2008.

In 2003, his proposals to re-write the European Parliament&#x27;s Rules of Procedure were largely accepted. In 2004–2005, he was the co-rapporteur (with Iñigo Méndez de Vigo) for Parliament on the Treaty establishing a constitution for Europe. This report formed the basis of Parliament&#x27;s official position on the treaty, which he was then invited to present to several national parliaments.

In 2005, he was appointed as Parliament&#x27;s negotiator (along with Joseph Daul MEP) to broker a new system of parliamentary scrutiny over Commission implementing measures (under the previously much-criticised &quot;comitology&quot; procedure), which led to an agreement among the Council of ministers, the Commission and the Parliament in 2006 giving Parliament the right to veto quasi-legislative implementing measures. This represented a major increase in Parliament&#x27;s powers over the Commission.

In 2007–08, he was again co-rapporteur with Iñigo Méndez de Vigo for Parliament on the Treaty of Lisbon, (which replaced the constitutional treaty after two member states had declined to ratify it) and was again rapporteur for a new overhaul of Parliament&#x27;s procedures in 2009 and, after his five years out of the Parliament (see below), in 2016 and 2018.

Corbett was a strong advocate of EU reform, with a particular interest in improving democratic accountability by continuing to increase the European Parliament&#x27;s power within the EU institutional system. Professor Juliet Lodge of Leeds University has named Corbett as one of five &quot;movers and shakers&quot; in the European Parliament who &quot;have brought the European Parliament from being a mere talking shop to a legislature with genuine power&quot;.

Corbett&#x27;s voting record and other parliamentary activities can be found on the VoteWatch website.

===Five years out of the European Parliament===
Corbett lost his seat in the 2009 European Parliament elections, which saw a big fall in the Labour share of the vote in the wake of the Westminster expenses scandal. The BNP took the seat. The BBC website carried the following comment from their European editor, Mark Mardell:

&quot;The saddest moment of the night: Labour MEP Richard Corbett lost his seat. Irrespective of party politics, there are some people who are good for politics as a whole. Mr Corbett, a decent, thoughtful politician, is also one of the few people who understand how the European Parliament actually works and explained it well. He&#x27;ll be missed on all sides of the chamber&quot;.

Mark Mardell had previously referred to Richard Corbett as:

&quot;an example of a conscientious and hard working politician if ever there was one&quot;.

After his defeat, Corbett spent two months in Ireland from August to October 2009 helping (behind the scenes) the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign in the second Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, in which 67% of the 59% turnout voted in favour.

In December 2009, Corbett was invited to join the private office (&quot;cabinet&quot;) of the first full-time President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, as his advisor on constitutional issues, but also handling his relations with the European Parliament and national parliaments, with the European Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee as well as helping on relations with some governments, including the UK.

===Return to the European Parliament===
Corbett left the Van Rompuy &quot;cabinet&quot; in March 2014, in order to stand for election in the 2014 European Parliament elections as the Labour party&#x27;s second candidate in Yorkshire &amp; Humber. In Labour&#x27;s internal ballot of party members to choose their candidates, Corbett came first (with the highest proportion of first preference votes of all new candidates in the country) securing him second spot on the list of Labour candidates, behind the sitting MEP Linda McAvan. Labour won two seats in the election in Yorkshire, and so Corbett was returned to the Parliament.

In Parliament, Corbett returned to the Constitutional Committee and served also on the Fisheries Committee (as a full member) and the Economic Committee (as a substitute). He was elected again as Deputy Leader of the Labour MEPs in September 2014. He was again rapporteur for a new overhaul of Parliament&#x27;s procedures in 2016 and 2018–19. On 25 October 2017 he was elected Leader of the Labour MEPs (EPLP) following the retirement of Glenis Willmott, defeating Siôn Simon and Clare Moody in the vote.

As Leader of the EPLP, Corbett was a member of the Labour Party NEC and attended Shadow Cabinet. In these roles, he was heavily engaged in the internal party discussions that eventually led to Labour calling for a new referendum on Brexit. He spoke at some of the large marches in London and elsewhere calling for a peoples&#x27; vote on the final Brexit deal, aon the ground that Brexit was turning out to be very different from what the Leave campaign had promised.

In advance of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Corbett launched an app called &quot;Doorstep EU&quot; for IPhone and Android in order to debunk myths about the EU, deliver authoritative briefings on key issues and detailed statistics of the EU&#x27;s impact on the United Kingdom.

He supported Yvette Cooper in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election, Owen Smith in the 2016 election, and Keir Starmer in the 2020 election.

===After Brexit===
In 2021-22, the European Parliament asked Corbett to represent it in the Common Secretariat running the Conference on the Future of Europe, while simultaneously being &quot;Deputy chef de cabinet&quot; to the Secretary General of the European Parliament.

In 2023, the S&amp;D Group in the European Parliament asked him to be one of three experts to carry out an independent inquiry into the Qatargate scandal. As the Belgian judicial investigation was still on-going, the inquiry could not trespass on its work, so it instead focussed on weaknesses in the rules and practices of the EU, the European Parliament and the S&amp;D Group that might have made inappropriate interference in the work of the Parliament more easy. Their report made a number of recommendations and those that required changes to the Parliament&#x27;s Rules of Procedure and the Code of Conduct for Members were subsequently taken up and largely adopted by the Parliament in the autumn of 2023.

Now retired, Corbett has continued to speak and write about European affairs. He authored the primer booklet &quot;The Progressive Potential of the EU&quot; that is being used for training of candidates and activists of the Party of European Socialists in the 2024 European elections.

==Other activities==
===Richard Corbett versus the UK Independence Party===
Richard Corbett was an early critic of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP).

In June 2004, he drew attention, in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, to UKIP links with the far-right British National Party in that year&#x27;s local elections: &quot;In Yorkshire, where both the BNP and UKIP put up candidates, they appear to have come to an arrangement not to stand against one another&quot;.

Richard Corbett&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;25 Things You Didn&#x27;t Know When You Voted For UKIP&quot;.

Following Ashley Mote&#x27;s imprisonment in September 2007 for fraud, Corbett called on the government to change the law which allowed the former UKIP MEP to be paid in full during his spell in jail. The Minister responsible for payment of MEPs (and MPs), Harriet Harman, promised to look into the matter.

Corbett continued to campaign vigorously against the UK Independence Party in the run-up to the 2014 European elections. After they secured the biggest share of the vote in these elections, he subsequently wrote &quot;I think it is a mistake to focus exclusively on UKIP&#x27;s racism. That unsavoury side of UKIP has been adequately exposed by others [...] We need to expose them on their policies&quot;.

===Sports policy===
In 2006, Corbett served on the Independent European Sport Review, set up by several national governments and UEFA and chaired by the former Portuguese Deputy Prime Minister Jose Luis Arnaut. The review was in fact about the governance of football, and Corbett chaired the sub-group on political aspects. The review paved the way for a number of changes introduced by UEFA, among them the UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. Corbett has maintained an interest in the governance of football ever since, taking up a number of issues with UEFA.

===Grimethorpe Colliery Band===
Corbett is the Honorary President of the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, a brass band based in Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire. The band achieved worldwide fame after appearing in the film &quot;Brassed Off&quot;, as well as becoming (along with Black Dyke Mills Band), the first brass band to perform at the Proms.

===Labour Party positions===
Corbett has held a number of offices in the UK Labour Party. As well as being Deputy Leader and, from October 2017 until Brexit, Leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party (EPLP), he served on the Regional Board for Yorkshire and the party&#x27;s National Policy Forum, a position to which he was re-elected by fellow Labour MEPs in May 2014. He was national chair of the Labour Movement for Europe from 2009 to 2011, and subsequently served as one of its Labour MEP representatives.

As Leader of the EPLP, Corbett was a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party and attended shadow cabinet meetings.

===Other organisations===
Corbett is Honorary Vice President of the UK European Movement, having served as Chair following the resignation of Laura Sandys in the wake of the 2016 referendum result. He did not want to continue as Chair, citing time constraints, and handed over to Stephen Dorrell in December 2016.

===Academic===
Corbett was a visiting professor at the College of Europe in Bruges and on the board of the Salzburg Centre for European Union Studies (SCEUS) of the University of Salzburg.

He has written numerous academic articles and books (see &#x27;Publications&#x27; below)

===Publications and communications activities===
Corbett is the co-author of an eponymous academic textbook on the European Parliament (now the standard reference book on it across Europe) and several other academic publications, most notably the Oxford University Press textbook &quot;The European Union: how does it work?&quot; (see below).

Corbett was an early user of new media. In 2003, he was the first MEP from any country to launch a blog, which he resumed in 2014 as part of his election campaign. In 2004 his website was cited as one of the most comprehensive of any British politician&#x27;s by &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine, which nominated him for a New Media award. In 2015, he became the first MEP to launch a mobile app, Doorstep EU, aimed at activists, journalists and other politicians. In the same year, he also took part in an AMA on Reddit.

Corbett starred in the docudrama film &quot;Do it like a European?&quot;, which won a prize at the international Winton Film Contest.

===Languages===
Corbett speaks English, French, German and Dutch.

==Personal life==
Corbett lives in Shipley near Bradford; he formerly lived in the nearby village of Saltaire, for whose World Heritage Status he helped to campaign. As an MEP, he had his constituency office in Leeds, where he shared premises with Hilary Benn MP.

Corbett is married to Lorraine Kirkwood. He was previously married to Inge Van Gaal and Anne De Malsche. He has three children and five grandchildren.

<text>Poundmaker ( – 4 July 1886), also known as pîhtokahânapiwiyin (), was a Plains Cree chief known as a peacemaker and defender of his people, the Poundmaker Cree Nation. His name denotes his special craft at leading buffalo into buffalo pounds (enclosures) for harvest.

In 1885, during the North-West Rebellion, his band was attacked by Canadian troops and a battle ensued. After the rebellion was suppressed, he surrendered and was convicted of treason and imprisoned. He died of illness soon after his release. In May 2019, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau exonerated the chief and apologized to the Poundmaker Cree Nation.

==Name==
According to Cree tradition, or oral history, &quot;pîhtokahânapiwiyin&quot;, known to English speakers as Chief Poundmaker, gained his name for his special ability to attract buffalo into pounds. A buffalo pound resembled a huge corral with walls covered by the leaves of thick bushes. Usually herds of buffalo were stampeded into this trap. But sometimes buffalo were drawn in by a person such as Poundmaker, who according to tradition was gifted by spirit helpers, singing and drumming a special song to entice a lead buffalo cow to lead her herd into the enclosure.

==Biography==
Poundmaker was born in Rupert&#x27;s Land, near present-day Battleford; the child of Sikakwayan (&quot;sikâkwayân&quot;), an Assiniboine medicine man, and a mixed-blood Cree woman, the sister of Chief Mistawasis (&quot;mistawâsis&quot;). Following the death of his parents, Poundmaker, his brother (Yellow Mud Blanket, &quot;osâwasiskîwakohp&quot;), and his younger sister, were all raised by their mother&#x27;s Cree community, led by Chief Wuttunee (&quot;wataniy&quot;), later known as the Red Pheasant Band. In his adult life, Poundmaker gained prominence during the 1876 negotiations of Treaty 6 and split off to form his own band. In 1881, the band settled on a reserve about 40 km northwest of Fort Battleford. Poundmaker was not opposed to the idea of a treaty, but became critical of the Canadian government&#x27;s failures to live up to its promises.

In 1873, Crowfoot, chief of the Blackfoot First Nation, had adopted Poundmaker thereby increasing the latter&#x27;s influence. This move also cemented the ties between the Blackfoot and the Cree, which successfully stopped the struggling over the now very scarce buffalo.

===North-West Rebellion===

The shortage of bison left Poundmaker&#x27;s people desperately famished, and in 1885, they travelled south to Battleford. Oral history accounts suggest Poundmaker went to the fort to speak with the Indian agent, Rae, and reaffirm his loyalty to the Queen after a murder at the nearby Mosquito Reserve; however, the people of Battleford and some of the settlers in the surrounding area, hearing reports of large numbers of Cree and Assiniboine leaving reserves and making their way to Battleford, feared for their safety. On the night of 30 March 1885, the townspeople began to abandon the town and seek shelter in the North-West Mounted Police Fort Battleford. When Poundmaker and his party reached the town, the Indian agent refused to come out of the fort to meet with them. He kept them waiting for two days. Telegrams sent by those barricaded in the fort indicated they believed it was an attack, but Peter Ballantyne exited the fort and, acting as a spy, checked Poundmaker&#x27;s plans and found his intentions peaceful.

Looting of the abandoned buildings of the town took place, but the identity of the looters is disputed. Some reports claimed Poundmaker&#x27;s people were responsible, but one observer alleged that most of the looting had already been done by whites. White witness oral history suggests daily looting by Indians. Native tradition suggests the looting was done by Nakoda people, and that Poundmaker did his best to stop it. Either way, Poundmaker&#x27;s people left the next day, to establish an encampment at Cut Knife Hill.

On 2 May 1885, a military force of 332 Canadian troops, led by Lieutenant-Colonel William Dillon Otter, crossed Cut Knife Creek and attacked Poundmaker&#x27;s camp on Cut Knife Hill. Lieutenant R.S. Cassels, attached to the command of the &quot;C&quot; School, a military division of the troops under Otter, stated the following:

After six hours of inconclusive skirmishing and suffering casualties, Otter ordered the withdrawal. As his force retreated, Poundmaker, who had not taken part in the fight, coaxed his band&#x27;s fighters not to pursue the soldiers. Likely, his actions prevented the loss of many lives on both sides as the active pursuit of the fleeing force would have prolonged the conflict as serious countermeasures would have been put into use to cover the retreat, and the Cree would likely have killed many as the soldiers made their retreat.

A few weeks later, after Riel&#x27;s defeat at Batoche, Poundmaker and his starving band went to Battleford to make peace with Major-General Middleton.

===Surrender, trial and death===

With the news of Louis Riel&#x27;s actions and defeat at Batoche, Poundmaker surrendered on May 26.

On the basis of a letter written by Louis Riel bearing his name, Poundmaker was convicted of treason in 1885 and sentenced to three years in Stony Mountain Penitentiary. He said to Riel, &quot;You did not catch me, I gave myself up. I wanted peace.&quot;

At his trial, he is reported to have said:
Because of the power of his adopted father, Crowfoot, Poundmaker&#x27;s hair was not cut in prison, and he served only seven months. Nonetheless, his stay there devastated his health and led to his death (from a lung hemorrhage) in 1886, at the age of 44.

He was buried at Blackfoot Crossing near Gleichen, Alberta, but his remains were exhumed in 1967, and reburied on the Poundmaker Reserve, Saskatchewan. Pictures from the exhumation and reburial were donated to the Allen Sapp museum in North Battleford.

===Exoneration===
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to members of the Poundmaker Cree Nation and others gathered at Cut Knife Hill, on 23 May 2019 to exonerate Poundmaker and clear his memory.

In part he said: &quot;The Government of Canada recognizes that Chief Poundmaker was not a criminal, but someone who worked tirelessly to ensure the survival of his people, and hold the Crown accountable to its obligations as laid out in Treaty 6. We recognize that the unjust conviction and imprisonment of Chief Poundmaker had, and continues to have, a profound impact on the Poundmaker Cree Nation.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Poundmaker Cree Nation continues to this day, near Cut Knife. Cut Knife Hill, the site of the North-West Rebellion battle, has been renamed Poundmaker Hill.

His grandnephew John Tootoosis, Cree leader, and great-grandnephew Gordon Tootoosis, actor, both lived on this reserve.

Poundmaker appears as the leader of the Cree in &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI&quot;, having bonuses related to trade and diplomacy. His appearance in the game drew criticism from some members of the Poundmaker Cree Nation, who felt that, by being included in a game based around expansion and conquest, his values and those of the Cree were misrepresented, and criticized the company for not formally approaching community elders, though they also acknowledged his positive portrayal, and hoped his inclusion in the game would help his, at the time ongoing, exoneration by publicizing his figure.

<doc id="723621" wikidata="Q70887" url="?curid=723621" title="Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff">
<text>Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff (; 13 May 1712 – 18 February 1772) was a German-Danish statesman and a member of the Bernstorff noble family of Mecklenburg. He was the son of Joachim Engelke &quot;Freiherr&quot; von Bernstorff, chamberlain to the Elector of Hanover.

==Early political career==
His grandfather, Andreas Gottlieb von Bernstorff (1640–1726), had been one of the ablest ministers of George I and the head of the German Chancery. Under his guidance, Johann was very carefully educated, acquiring amongst other things that intimate knowledge of the leading European languages, especially French, which ever afterwards distinguished him. He was introduced into the Danish service by his relations, the brothers Plessen, who were ministers of state under Christian VI.

In 1732, he was sent on a diplomatic mission to the court of Dresden, and from 1738 he represented Holstein at the Eternal Diet of Regensburg. From 1744 to 1750, he represented Denmark at Paris, whence he returned in 1754 to Denmark as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Supported by the powerful favorite Adam Gottlob Moltke, and highly respected by Frederick V, he occupied for twenty-one years the highest position in the government, and in the Council of State his opinion was decisive. But his chief concern was foreign policy.

==Prelude==
Ever since the conclusion of the Great Northern War, Danish statesmen had been occupied in harvesting its fruits, namely, the Gottorp portions of Schleswig definitely annexed to Denmark in 1721 by the Treaty of Nystad, and endeavouring to bring about a definitive general understanding with the House of Gottorp as to their remaining possessions in Holstein. With the head of the Swedish branch of the Gottorps, the crown prince Adolph Frederick, things had been arranged by the exchange of 1750; but an attempt to make a similar arrangement with the chief of the elder Gottorp line, the Czarevitch Peter Feodorovich, had failed.

In intimate connection with the Gottorp affair stood the question of the political equilibrium of the north. Ever since Russia had become the dominant Baltic power, as well as the state to which the Gottorpers looked primarily for help, the necessity for a better understanding between the two Scandinavian kingdoms had clearly been recognized by the best statesmen of both, especially in Denmark from Christian VI&#x27;s time; but unfortunately this sound and sensible policy was seriously impeded by the survival of the old national hatred on both sides of The Sound, still further complicated by the Gottorps&#x27; hatred of Denmark. Moreover, it was a diplomatic axiom in Denmark, founded on experience, that an absolute monarchy in Sweden was incomparably more dangerous to her neighbour than a limited monarchy, and after the collapse of Swedish absolutism with Charles XII, the upholding of the comparatively feeble, and ultimately anarchical parliamentary government of Sweden became a question of principle with Danish statesmen throughout the 18th century.

==Bernstorff&#x27;s Denmark==
A friendly alliance with a relatively weak Sweden was the cardinal point of Bernstorff&#x27;s policy. But his plans were reversed again and again by unforeseen complications, the failure of the most promising presumptions, the perpetual shifting of apparently stable alliances; and again and again he had to modify his means to attain his ends. Amidst all these perplexities Bernstorff proved himself a consummate statesman. It seemed almost as if his wits were sharpened into a keener edge by his very difficulties; but since he condemned on principle every war which was not strictly defensive, and it had fallen to his lot to guide a comparatively small power, he always preferred the way of negotiation, even sometimes where the diplomatic tangle would perhaps best have been severed boldly by the sword.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
The first difficult problem he had to face was the Seven Years&#x27; War. He was determined to preserve the neutrality of Denmark at any cost, and this he succeeded in doing, despite the existence of a subsidy-treaty with the king of Prussia, and the suspicions of Britain and Sweden. It was through his initiative, too, that the Convention of Klosterzeven was signed (10 September 1757), and on the 4 May 1758 he concluded a still more promising treaty with France, whereby, in consideration of Denmark&#x27;s holding an army-corps of 24,000 men in Holstein until the end of the war, to secure Hamburg, Lübeck, and the Gottorp part of Holstein from invasion, France, and ultimately Austria also, engaged to bring about an exchange between the king of Denmark and the Czarevitch, as regards Holstein.

But the course of the war made this compact inoperative. Austria hastened to repudiate her guarantee to Denmark in order not to offend the new emperor of Russia, Czar Peter III, and one of Peter&#x27;s first acts on ascending the throne was to declare war against Denmark. The coolness and firmness of Bernstorff saved the situation. He protested that the king of Denmark was bound to defend Schleswig so long as there was a sword in Denmark and a drop of blood in the veins of the Danish people. He rejected the insulting ultimatum of the Russian emperor. He placed the best French general of the day at the head of the well-equipped Danish army.

But just as the Russian and Danish armies had come within striking distance, the tidings reached Copenhagen that Peter III had been overthrown by his consort, Catherine II.

==After the war==
Bernstorff was one of the first to recognize the impotence of the French monarchy after the Seven Years&#x27; War, and in 1763 he considered it expedient to exchange the French for the Russian alliance, which was cemented by the treaty of the 28 April 1765. This compact engaged Denmark to join with Russia in upholding the existing Swedish constitution, in return for which Czarina Catherine II agreed to resolve the Gottorp Question by the cession of the Gottorp portion of Holstein in exchange for the counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, an exchange realized in the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo. For his part in this treaty Bernstorff was created count.

==Fall from power==
On the accession of Christian VII, in 1766, Bernstorff&#x27;s position became very precarious, and he was exposed to all manner of attacks, being accused of exploiting Denmark, and of unduly promoting foreigners. It is remarkable, however, that though Bernstorff ruled Denmark for twenty years he never learnt the Danish language. His last political achievement was to draw still closer to Russia by the treaty of the 13 December 1769, the most important paragraph of which stipulated that any change in the Swedish constitution should be regarded by Denmark and Russia as a casus belli against Sweden, and that in the event of such a war Denmark should retain all the territory conquered from Sweden. This treaty proved to be a great mistake on Denmark&#x27;s part, but circumstances seemed at the time to warrant it. Nine months later, on the 13 September 1770, Bernstorff was dismissed as the result of Johann Friedrich Struensee&#x27;s intrigues, and, rejecting the brilliant offers of Catherine II if he would enter the Russian service, retired to his German estates, where he died on the 18 February 1772.

<doc id="723622" wikidata="Q455522" url="?curid=723622" title="Linda McAvan">
<text>Linda McAvan (born 2 December 1962) is a British Labour Party politician, who was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Yorkshire South and Yorkshire and the Humber from 1998, when she was first elected in a by-election following the resignation of Norman West. She served until her resignation on 19 April 2019.

Before being elected McAvan worked for Barnsley Borough Council and was the European Officer for the Coalfields Community Campaign.

==Member of the European Parliament==
McAvan was a Member of the European Parliament since 1998. From 2014 until 2019, she served as chairwoman of the Committee on Development. In this capacity, she co-chaired (alongside David McAllister) the Democracy Support and Election Coordination Group (DEG), which oversees the Parliament&#x27;s election observation missions.

In addition to her committee assignments, McAvan was a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. She chaired the European Parliament&#x27;s Fair Trade Working Group and serves on the European Parliament Intergroup on the Western Sahara as well as on the European Parliament Intergroup on Children&#x27;s Rights. She is also a supporter of the MEP Heart Group, a group of parliamentarians who have an interest in promoting measures that will help reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

Between 2002 and 2003, McAvan served as one of 16 representatives of the European Parliament in the Convention on the Future of Europe, led by former French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing.

In 2002, McAvan was voted UK European Woman of the Year; she received her award from the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam, who praised her efforts to engage women in the future of Europe. Later that year, however, she lost out against Gary Titley in the contest to select a new leader of British Labour MEPs.

From 2004 to 2009, McAvan served as treasurer of the European Parliament&#x27;s Socialist Group. In June 2007 she was elected vice president of the group.

Between 2004 and 2014, McAvan served on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. In 2009, she drafted the European Parliament&#x27;s report on monitoring medicine safety. She also sat on the Temporary Committee on Climate Change between 2007 and 2009; in this capacity, she was part of the Parliament&#x27;s delegations to the 2008 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poznań and to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.

McAvan supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

Labour Party members elected McAvan to be the top-ranked Labour candidate for Yorkshire and the Humber in the 2009 European elections, narrowly beating Richard Corbett for the top place. In 2014, she again topped the ballot. She stood down as an MEP on 19 April 2019.

==Life after politics==
Since leaving the European Parliament, McAvan has been working as executive director for European relations at the European Climate Foundation.

==Other activities==
* National Coal Mining Museum for England, Member of the Steering Committee
* Reconsidering European Contributions to Global Justice (GLOBUS), Member of the Policy Advisory Board

==Recognition==
McAvan was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for charitable and political services.

==Personal life==
McAvan is married to Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central. Her constituency office was in Wath-upon-Dearne.

<text>Jadis is a fictional character and the main antagonist of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; (1955) in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s series, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. She is commonly referred to as the White Witch in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, as she is the Witch who froze Narnia in the Hundred Years Winter.

Some recent editions of the books include brief notes, added by later editors, that describe the cast of characters. As Lewis scholar Peter Schakel points out, the notes&#x27; description of Jadis and the Queen of Underland (the main antagonist of &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;) &quot;states incorrectly that the Queen of Underland is an embodiment of Jadis&quot;. Beyond characterising the two as &quot;Northern Witches&quot;, Lewis&#x27;s text does not connect them.

==Character history==
Jadis was born on an unknown date long before the creation of Narnia. In &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; she is identified by a character as a descendant of giants and Adam&#x27;s first wife (Lilith):

Jadis died in battle in Narnian year 1000, meaning that she lived for well over 1,000 years.

===&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;===
In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, Jadis is introduced as the last Queen of Charn, a city in an entirely different world from Narnia. She was the last of a long line of kings and queens, who were good in the beginning but grew evil over many generations and conquered the entire world of Charn, ruling it as despots. Jadis, a powerful sorceress, fought a bloody war of rebellion against her sister. On the point of defeat, Jadis chose not to submit, but instead spoke the Deplorable Word, a powerful spell which destroyed all life on Charn except her own. She then cast a spell of enchanted sleep upon herself to await someone who could rescue her from Charn.

Many years later, a 12-year-old Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer arrive in the ruins of Charn through Digory&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s magic. The children find the bell that Jadis left to break the spell. Despite Polly&#x27;s warning not to ring the bell, Digory does so. Jadis is awakened and by holding on to them is transported with them back to London in the year 1900. She initially aims to conquer the world to which she is transported, but finds that her magic does not work there. Digory, seeking to correct his mistake, attempts to transport her back to Charn, but they end up instead in the world of Narnia at the moment of its creation by the lion Aslan. As Aslan approaches, she attacks him with the rod of iron she has torn from a London lamp post with her great physical strength; when this has no effect, she flees.

Jadis makes her way to the garden on a mountain west of Narnia, where she eats an apple that she believes will make her immortal and give her eternal life. However, this supposed immortality comes at a cost: her skin is bleached white, and the evil in her heart causes her eternal misery. She cannot stand the sight of the tree that Aslan has Digory plant in Narnia from the fruit of the garden, and she thus stays to the north of Narnia, working to develop her magic.

Meanwhile, the land of Narnia remains the domain of animals (chosen animals are given the ability to speak, and become pillars of society) and is not troubled by the Witch nor any other enemy for many hundreds of years.

===&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;===
In &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, set 1,000 Narnian years after the events of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, the tree that kept Jadis at bay has died, and Jadis has usurped power over Narnia. She is now known as the White Witch, and is served by various races including Wolves (who make up her secret police), Black Dwarves, Giants, Werewolves, Tree Spirits that are on her side, Ghouls, Boggles, Ogres, Minotaurs, Cruels, Hags, Spectres, People of the Toadstools, Incubi, Wraiths, Horrors, Efreets, Orknies, Sprites, Wooses, Ettins, Poisonous Plant Spirits, Evil Apes, Giant Bats, Vultures, and creatures that (as Lewis writes) are &quot;so horrible that if I told you, your parents probably wouldn&#x27;t let you read this book.&quot; 

The Witch&#x27;s magic is now powerful, and with her wand she can turn enemies to stone. Many good Narnians who have objected to her rule have ended up being captured by the Witch and her forces and turned into stone in the courtyard or the interior of her castle, which stands isolated between two hills in the north of Narnia. Stories of this grim fate have spread around Narnia from the few Narnians who were lucky enough to have been taken there and were then released or managed to escape.

She styles herself &quot;Her Imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands&quot;, and she casts Narnia into an endless winter with no Christmas. She fears a prophecy that four humans – two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve – will bring about the end of her reign and ultimately her life, and orders all Narnians to bring any human they come across to her.

By the time the Pevensie children arrive in Narnia, Jadis has ruled for 100 years, although a mere 40 years have passed on Earth since she first arrived in Narnia. The children were staying as wartime evacuees at the country home of Digory Kirke, now an ageing professor.

She first meets Edmund Pevensie while riding on her sledge through the land of Narnia, enchants him with magical Turkish delight, and tempts him to betray his siblings by offering to make him her heir. She wants all four of them, although at this stage only Edmund and his sister Lucy have been in Narnia. The four Pevensie children arrive together in Narnia soon afterwards, and Edmund strays to the Witch after he and the other children are taken in by Mr and Mrs Beaver. While he understands now that the &quot;Queen of Narnia&quot; (as she had introduced herself) and the White Witch are one and the same, he is still determined to taste more Turkish Delight – and remains convinced that the Witch would keep her promise to make him heir to her throne. In the meantime, her Secret Police had captured Tumnus the faun, who had harboured Lucy on her first visit to Narnia, after discovering that he had disobeyed the Witch’s orders to hand over any humans to her.

But with the approach of Aslan, her magical winter thaws. Edmund receives a hostile reception from the White Witch upon arriving at her castle without his siblings, who is even angrier when he informs her that Aslan has arrived in Narnia. The harshness of the Witch&#x27;s winter makes Edmund realise that he has been wrong in thinking that her side was the right side, and he realises the full extent of her evil when he witnesses her angrily turning a party of creatures into stone after their revelation that Father Christmas had been in Narnia.

A wolf eventually reaches Jadis and informs her that Edmund&#x27;s siblings have reached Aslan&#x27;s camp and that one of them killed Maugrim. Jadis sends the wolf off to rally her army as speedily as they can, as she prepares to kill Edmund as a traitor. Aslan&#x27;s army advances to rescue Edmund as Jadis uses a spell to conceal herself and her dwarf.

Jadis then arrives at the Stone Table, and meets Aslan for a parley, and insists on her right, as the first to rebel against Aslan, to take the life of Edmund as a traitor. She accepts Aslan&#x27;s offer of his own life as substitute, knowing that without him the Pevensies cannot stand against her. Aslan keeps this pact secret from his followers. Jadis has Aslan bound at the Stone Table, and an ogre shaves his mane. She tells him that his sacrifice won&#x27;t save Edmund and that he has given her Narnia forever. Then she kills him with a stone knife. Susan and Lucy, who followed Aslan from their encampment, witness his death from bushes nearby.

Jadis is unaware, however, of a deeper magic from before Narnia&#x27;s founding. As a willing innocent victim who has offered his life in a traitor&#x27;s stead, Aslan is revived. He then heads to her castle and restores all her statues to life. He brings them as reinforcements to the battle at Beruna against the witch&#x27;s army, who are already battling against Aslan’s followers. Her army is defeated, and Aslan himself kills Jadis. Most of her followers are killed and the remnants of her army who do not surrender flee and are later killed by Aslan&#x27;s followers.

===References and comparisons in other Narnia books===
In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, 1,300 years after the Witch&#x27;s death, Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines, a human race who believe they have wiped out Narnia&#x27;s population of mythical beings and talking animals. The old Narnians, however, are still very much alive and have been driven into hiding, and they rebel under the leadership of the disinherited Telmarine heir, Prince Caspian. When their fight against the Telmarines gets off to a bad start, a black dwarf (Nikabrik), a hag, and a wer-wolf (to use Lewis&#x27;s spelling) plan to resurrect Jadis to fight for them, as they consider her a lesser evil than the current ruler, King Miraz, despite Caspian’s insistence that the Witch was far worse than Miraz, and his tutor’s insistence that the Witch is dead. They are then killed in a melee which involves Caspian, his tutor Dr Cornelius, and Peter and Edmund, who have been recalled to Narnia after Caspian blows Susan&#x27;s horn. On the orders of Aslan and the newly-crowned King Caspian, Narnia is now a land in which humans and talking animals are encouraged to integrate and have equal rights.

Jadis does not appear in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, though the stone knife she used to kill Aslan at the Stone Table has been found on Ramandu&#x27;s island by three of the Seven Great Lords of Narnia who had been banished there several years earlier. Disagreeing on what course to take, one of them takes up the knife to use against the other two, whereupon all three fall into an enchanted sleep. The knife may be intended as an analogy to the Holy Lance, the spear used to pierce Jesus Christ, according to the Gospel of John.

In &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, 1,356 years after her death, Jadis is described as one of the &quot;Northern Witches&quot;, along with the Lady of the Green Kirtle - a new enemy to the good animals and humans who now inhabit Narnia. Glimfeather the Owl speculates that the Green Lady may be &quot;of the same crew&quot; as the White Witch. This has led to speculation by some readers that Jadis and the Lady of the Green Kirtle may be the same person. Lewis&#x27;s text does not support this (See &quot;Lady of the Green Kirtle&quot; for further discussion). Lewis never clarifies the Green Lady&#x27;s origins, or what connection she has to the White Witch. 

The &quot;Green Lady&quot; had first entered Narnia in serpent form and killed the wife of King Caspian, and later re-emerged in human form to lure away Caspian&#x27;s son Rilian and place him under an enchantment in the underworld. Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole reach the underworld with their guide, Puddleglum the marshwiggle, and rescue Rilian - who kills the Green Lady before they return to Narnia.

==Characteristics==
An extraordinarily beautiful, tall, and imposing woman, Jadis enchants Digory Kirke, Andrew Ketterley and Edmund Pevensie on first encounters. She is seven feet tall, as were all members of the Royal Family of Charn. After eating the fruit of eternal life, her skin becomes as white as paper.

A natural-born sorceress and a cunning strategist, Jadis is arrogant and cruel, considering herself above all rules and viewing others as tools to be used or obstacles to be demolished. After she eats the Fruit of Everlasting Life, selfishly and against the written admonition on the gate, she discovers that her sense of inner power and life is amplified. Her callousness and sense of entitlement are most clearly demonstrated when she uses the Deplorable Word in Charn to vanquish her sister, even though the Word would eradicate all life in that world but her own. She prefers to destroy that entire world than submit to her sister&#x27;s authority and shows afterward a remorseless pride in her actions.

Though her magic disappears when she leaves Charn, she manages to build it up again in Narnia&#x27;s world, exercising both her previous experience and her privilege to witness a new world&#x27;s dawning to become again a sorceress of formidable power, though she is still outclassed by Aslan. She eventually usurps the throne of Narnia, using her magic to cast the land into perpetual winter. Her most feared weapon is her wand, whose magic is capable of turning people into stone. The petrified remains of her enemies decorate the halls of her castle. For the brief time that Jadis is on Earth, she has no magical power but retains her phenomenal strength. This is demonstrated when she battles with Metropolitan Police in London, wielding the cross-bar she wrenched from a lamp post. The same cross-bar is taken into the new world that would become Narnia and grows into the full lamp post encountered by Lucy Pevensie many years later.

==Portrayals==
===Radio===
The voice of Jadis was provided by Elizabeth Counsell in Focus on the Family&#x27;s radio drama versions of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;. Counsell also made a cameo appearance as a lamb in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. The distribution rights to this version were later purchased by the BBC.
In an earlier 1988 BBC radio version, she was played by Rosemary Martin.

===Television===

* The White Witch was played by Elizabeth Wallace in the 1967 British TV series &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;.
* In the sixth episode of &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, during a game of hide-and-seek, Vyvyan attempts to hide in a wardrobe. He ends up in Narnia, and meets the White Witch, portrayed by actress Justine Lord. She approaches him much the same way as with Edmund in the book, but Vyvyan is uninterested, and tries to hide in an empty tree that leads back to the apartment, against her protests. 
* American actress Beth Porter provided the voice of the White Witch for the 1979 animated television adaptation of &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; (for the British release, Sheila Hancock&#x27;s voice was dubbed in). In that version, Aslan lunges towards the White Witch and she disappears in a cloud of smoke upon her defeat.
* English actress Barbara Kellerman played the White Witch in the 1988 BBC miniseries &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; season 1, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (Kellerman was retained as the hag in season 2 and the Lady of the Green Kirtle in season 3, characters from the second and fourth Narnia novels). After her wand is broken, she runs up the ravine, only for Aslan to arrive with reinforcements and roar enough for the ground to shake and the White Witch to lose her balance and fall to her death. In the original novel, it is stated that Jadis is half-Djinn and half-giant.

===Theatrical film series===

In the 2005 Walt Disney Pictures feature film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, she was portrayed by British actress Tilda Swinton. Swinton&#x27;s performance won particular acclaim among fans and critics. BBC film critic Stella Papamichael wrote:

Tilda Swinton was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for her performance as the White Witch in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, but lost to Hayden Christensen for his performance as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

Swinton reprised her role as the White Witch in the 2008 sequel &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;. In a departure from the novel, Nikabrik and his fellow conspirators (a hag and werewolf) use the White Witch&#x27;s retrieved wand to conjure an apparition of Jadis within a mystical wall of ice. She tries to coax Caspian and then Peter into offering her a drop of their blood so that she can come back to life, promising to lend her powers to their fight against King Miraz once she is made whole. However, Edmund shatters the ice, and the apparition vanishes.

Swinton reprised White Witch again in the 20th Century Fox film adaptation of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, only as a manifestation of the Dark Island preying on Edmund&#x27;s fears, a mental test that Edmund overcomes as he manages to kill the Dark Island&#x27;s sea serpent, a manifestation of his fear. The apparition disappears, screaming in defeat.

Swinton has expressed interest in returning to the role once more in a film adaptation of &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;.

===Literature===
Jadis appears in the Neil Gaiman short story &quot;The Problem of Susan&quot; which appeared in the 2006 collection &quot;Fragile Things&quot;.

== Commemoration ==
In 2011, the White Witch was one of eight British magical figures, which included the wizards Merlin (from Arthurian legend), Albus Dumbledore (from &quot;Harry Potter&quot;) and Rincewind (from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot;), commemorated on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail.

<doc id="723630" wikidata="Q1144414" url="?curid=723630" title="Theobroma grandiflorum">
<text>Theobroma grandiflorum, commonly known as cupuaçu, also spelled cupuassu, cupuazú, cupu assu, or copoazu, is a tropical rainforest tree related to cacao. Native and common throughout the Amazon basin, it is naturally cultivated in the jungles of northern Brazil, with the largest production in Pará, Amazonas and Amapá, Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. The pulp of the cupuaçu fruit is consumed throughout Central and South America, especially in the northern states of Brazil, and is used to make ice creams, snack bars, and other products.

== Description ==

Cupuaçu trees usually range from in height, though some can reach . They have brown bark, and the leaves range from long and across, with 9 or 10 pairs of veins. As the trees mature, the leaves change from pink-tinted to green, and eventually they begin bearing fruit.

Flowers of cupuaçu are structurally complex, and require pollination from biotic vectors. The majority of cupuaçu trees are self-incompatible, which can result in decreased pollination levels, and consequently, a decrease in fruit yields. Pollination can also be negatively affected by environmental conditions. Pollinators, which include chrysomelid weevils and stingless bees, are unable to fly between flowers in heavy rains.
The white pulp of the cupuaçu has an odour described as a mix of chocolate and pineapple and is frequently used in desserts, juices and sweets. The juice tastes primarily like pear, banana, passion fruit, and melon. Chocolate made from cupuaçu, very similar to that made from cocoa, is called &quot;cupulate.&quot;

== Cultivation ==

Cupuaçu is most commonly propagated from seed, but grafting and rooted cuttings are also used.

Cupuaçu trees are often incorporated in agroforestry systems throughout the Amazon due to their high tolerance of infertile soils, which are predominant in the Amazon region.

Cupuaçu is generally harvested from the ground once they have naturally fallen from the tree. It can be difficult to determine peak ripeness because there is no noticeable external color change in the fruit. However studies have shown that in Western Colombian Amazon conditions, fruits generally reach full maturity within 117 days after fruit set. Brazilians either eat it raw or use it in making sweets.

Commercial food products include pulp and powder.

== Pests and diseases ==
Witches&#x27; broom (&quot;Moniliophthora perniciosa&quot;) is the most prominent disease that affects cupuaçu trees. It affects the entire tree and can result in significant loss of yields and even tree death if left untreated. Regular pruning is recommended to reduce the severity of this disease in cupuaçu plantings.

Cupuaçu supports the butterfly herbivore, &quot;lagarta verde&quot;, &quot;Macrosoma tipulata&quot; (Hedylidae), which can be a defoliator.

== Phytochemicals ==
Cupuaçu flavors derive from its phytochemicals, such as tannins, glycosides, theograndins, catechins, quercetin, kaempferol and isoscutellarein. It also contains theacrine, caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline as found in cacao, although with a much lower amount of caffeine.

==Cupuaçu butter==

Cupuaçu butter is a triglyceride composed of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, giving the butter a low melting point (approximately 30 °C) and texture of a soft solid, lending its use as a confectionery resembling white chocolate. The main fatty acid components of cupuaçu butter are stearic acid (38%), oleic acid (38%), palmitic acid (11%), and arachidic acid (7%).

<text>A or is &quot;a type of Japanese video game centered on interactions with attractive girls&quot;.

&quot;Bishōjo&quot; games are similar to &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books in the way of narrative, in which the game tells a story but the player may make choices to change how the story flows.

==History==
===1980s===
&quot;Bishōjo&quot; games began to appear in Japan in the beginning days of personal computers. The first &quot;bishōjo&quot; game commercialized in Japan appeared in 1982 as &quot;Night Life&quot; by Koei. The first &quot;bishōjo&quot; games were not too popular, being limited to graphics of 16 colors or less. At the beginning of the genre, almost all the games were pornographic.

A notable landmark was Jast&#x27;s &quot;Tenshitachi no gogo&quot; (1985), a precursor to the modern dating simulation. Among early &quot;bishōjo&quot; adventure games it had a degree of polish that previous games lacked. It was also the first to have recognizably modern anime-style artwork: its characters had very large eyes and a tiny nose and mouth but were otherwise basically normally proportioned, characteristics which today are found in virtually all &quot;bishōjo&quot; games. Prior to 1985, girls were generally drawn either as normally proportioned adults or super deformed children.

===1990s===
The industry gradually moved away from proprietary Japanese hardware to the burgeoning DOS platform, and then later in the decade to Windows. Throughout the nineties, &quot;bishōjo&quot; games underwent an evolution from being one of the most technologically demanding types of games (because their detailed 2D graphics required a large amount of storage space by the standards of early computers) to one of the least (they rarely use 3D graphics). Thus, more than regular games, the main employees required by &quot;bishōjo&quot; game companies today are not programmers, but artists and writers.

In the early nineties the atmosphere in Japan became more and more hostile towards &quot;bishōjo&quot; games. In 1989 serial killer Tsutomu Miyazaki was arrested and was revealed to be a consumer of &quot;lolicon&quot; manga, causing widespread opposition to pornographic manga, otaku and anything similar. In November 1991 there was an incident where a middle-schooler shoplifted an adult &quot;bishōjo&quot; game &quot;&quot;, resulting in increased police scrutiny for makers and retailers. Several prefectures began classifying games as obscene and pulling them off the shelves.

Faced with the threat of being forcibly censored out of existence by the government, in 1992 the &quot;bishōjo&quot; game industry formed the &quot;Computer Software Rinri Kikō&quot; (meaning &quot;Ethics Organization for Computer Software&quot;, and often abbreviated &quot;EOCS&quot; or &quot;Sofu-rin&quot;), setting industry guidelines for acceptable content and packaging. This organization tamed down the most objectionable content in the &quot;wild west&quot; of the 1980s. Thus free from controversy and fueled by continuing improvement in technology, in the 1990s the &quot;bishōjo&quot; game industry underwent a decade-long boom.

The first major title of the 1990s was &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;, released in 1994 by Konami which was on the verge of bankruptcy, the platonic dating sim becoming the first major &quot;bishōjo&quot; game since Koei&#x27;s release of &quot;Night Life&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Kanon&quot; was released by Visual Arts/Key. While the title was another &quot;eroge&quot; title targeted at males for its sexual content, the players began to identify with the protagonist and the idea of overcoming &quot;the emotional trials and tribulations of pure love.&quot; A late PlayStation 2 port removed the sexual content and sold better than the original, leading eventually to two anime adaptations.

A turning point was ELF&#x27;s &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot; (1992). &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot;, whose gameplay focused on meeting girls and seducing them, established the standard conventions of the dating simulation genre. &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;, the first dating sim, featured good graphics, full voice acting, and a role-playing game-like gameplay system. To be accessible to a more mainstream audience, it contained no erotic elements, seeking instead to create a &quot;romantic&quot; atmosphere. Sega&#x27;s popular &quot;bishōjo&quot; game series &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; also first saw publication in 1996 for the Sega Saturn; like &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;, it contained no erotic elements. However, it was unique in that it contained not only adventure-game elements but also a combat system borrowed from tactical combat games such as &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;.

Since the late nineties, there has been a trend towards better storytelling in mainstream &quot;bishōjo&quot; games. Particularly notable in this respect are Leaf&#x27;s &quot;To Heart&quot; (1997), and Key&#x27;s &quot;Kanon&quot; (1999). Even though their gameplay involved little more than scrolling through text, they became hits largely due to the quality of their writing and characterization. Both were first released on the PC with erotic scenes, which were subsequently removed in their console ports.

=== 2000s ===
The &quot;bishōjo&quot; gaming industry has resisted the transition into 3D graphics because of the blocky and distorted nature of characters when viewed zoomed up close. In 2001 &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 3&quot; became the first &quot;bishōjo&quot; game to break this trend. However, low sales make it likely that other companies will stick with the traditional 2D graphics.

Today the industry has grown, with most publishers making releases for Windows, including download-only files. Some of the least pornographic and most successful also branching off into the console market. The main consoles used for &quot;bishōjo&quot; games in the nineties were the Sega Saturn and Dreamcast. More recently, the PlayStation 2 has been the console of choice with a growing number of games for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS handhelds. Games ported to consoles usually have adult content removed.

==Characteristics==
The industry of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games is closely related to the industry of anime and Japanese manga. While many of the games are pornographic, the majority feature romantic situations with suggestive material.

Some &quot;dōjinshi&quot; groups produce &quot;bishōjo&quot; games, many with the objective to later form a real company or to be contracted by one of the great companies in the industry. Due to the short programming time and the relatively small amount of content required in a &quot;bishōjo&quot; game, barriers to enter this industry is somewhat low, and is the reason why every year dozens of new companies emerge.
A substantial part of the revenue of the industry comes from merchandising. Fans are often dedicated to particular characters within their favorite games, and are willing to pay premium prices for goods like posters, figurines and accessories representing them. Several conventions also exist where articles oriented to &quot;bishōjo&quot; fans are sold, like the popular &quot;dōjinshi&quot; market Comiket in Tokyo, Japan.

Due to the representation of female characters in the majority of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games, a great majority of the market is male. Nevertheless, from the year 2000, some developers began to expand their market, creating games directed to girls and presenting attractive young men in their cast (&quot;bishōnen&quot;). The most well-known and commercial of these titles is Konami&#x27;s experiment &quot;Tokimeki Memorial Girl&#x27;s Side&quot; (2002). There have even appeared a small number of erotic games that present man–man homosexual relations (&quot;yaoi&quot; games), which take their bases from the parallel subculture of &quot;yaoi&quot; anime and manga. Games targeted specifically at female players are not referred to as &quot;bishōjo&quot; games, but categorized under the broader genre of adventure or simulation by publishers, and commonly referred to as &quot;otome&quot; games or Boys&#x27; Love games by fans and reviewers.

===Gameplay===

&quot;Bishōjo&quot; game elements can be present in practically any type of video game, and gameplay in &quot;bishōjo&quot; games varies within the genre. There are still some basic formulas that define the genre. The basic characteristics of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games resemble those of Choose Your Own Adventure books. The basic appearance of a &quot;bishōjo&quot; game consists of an image in the upper portion, a text box in the lower portion and a static background that occasionally changes extending to the edge behind both of the other two areas. The background images are often reused for various scenes and text descriptors are used to help distinguish differences in the surrounding. In most of the games, the player does not see their avatar and instead see the game from a first person perspective. In addition, some games use various techniques, such as the screen shaking, flashing or going black, to give further immersion by demonstrating various conditions. The games&#x27; range of sound effects are also used to represent the avatar&#x27;s eardrums. The characters of these games are less realistic and often limited to only several static facial expression, gestures and occasional eye blinks, of which the former two coincide with the text displayed at the bottom of the scene and are constantly reused.
The basic storylines for these games center around a male protagonist whom the player controls, who interacts with various characters, notably females. Interaction occurs at several points where choices—seemingly trivial—are given to the player while life-altering choices are generally not. These choices eventually lead to various good or bad endings with (or without for some bad endings) one or more female characters.

Beating these games does not mean just getting various good endings, but also in some cases bad endings, as the goal is to unlock all of the bonus content. This makes getting the same ending twice and not unlocking any new content the way to lose such games. For example, &quot;Gals Panic&quot; is a variant of the classic game &quot;Qix&quot; where the objective is to uncover 75% or more of a picture of a girl. &quot;Money Idol Exchanger&quot; is a puzzle game comparable to the &quot;Magical Drop&quot; series (which is also categorized as a &quot;bishōjo&quot; game). In some cases, images of girls are used as prizes for skilled play, as is the case in strip Mahjong. In other games, the &quot;bishōjo&quot; aspect can be integrated more tightly into the game: in most dating sims, the objective is to select the correct conversation lines while speaking with a female character to increase their &quot;love meter&quot;. This type of game resembles role-playing or adventure games. Many are very linear and are essentially interactive romance novels for men (sometimes called &quot;visual novels&quot;).

Most &quot;bishōjo&quot; games remain 2D. The main reason is that &quot;bishōjo&quot; games are centered mainly on characters instead of landscapes, and for this intention, 2D bitmaps continue to look better than 3D models (which tend to be blocky when seen up close). The main advantage of 3D models in this context is smoother and more realistic animation, although this is usually discarded by the unpolished look of the 3D characters, in addition to the additional cost of production for this type of work. &quot;Tokimeki Memorial 3&quot; (2001) was the first &quot;bishōjo&quot; game to have all its characters modeled in 3D, although the sales were smaller than hoped, perhaps discouraging other developers from the possibility of changing &quot;bishōjo&quot; games from 2D to 3D. Many &quot;bishōjo&quot; games nowadays are essentially a slideshow of 2D pictures plus voice and text.

While there are a number of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games entirely focused on hardcore pornography, many of the most popular titles, including all those available for home video consoles, do not contain pornographic material, and many others only contain a small amount in relation to the story as a whole. For example, the 18+ version of the popular game Sabbat Of The Witch (also known as Sanoba Witch) contains a total of twenty- four short adult scenes within a branched story.

The pornographic content of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games is regulated by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS), the organization in charge of classifying the content of video games in the Japanese industry. Pornography is prohibited in all console titles, and computer games are assigned a special classification alerting the public to its content. Also, as in all legal Japanese pornography, the explicit images are normally censored, showing mosaics or bars on the genital areas in order to satisfy Japanese decency laws.

Pornographic &quot;bishōjo&quot; games are often catalogued as &quot;hentai games&quot; in the West. In Japan, they are usually called &quot;ero&quot;-games, or frequently &quot;eroge&quot;.

===Representation of women===
The representation of girls in &quot;bishōjo&quot; games varies, but two generalizations can be made. First, most of the girls are portrayed as &quot;bishōjo&quot;, meaning beautiful, attractive or cute.

Two particularly common settings exist: Japanese secondary schools and medieval-atmosphered, pseudo-European fantasy lands. In secondary education settings, characters wear idealized Japanese school uniforms; whereas fantasy setting outfits range from witch robes to princess dresses, and fantastic creatures like fairies and catgirls may be found as well. When the game takes place in some other setting, it tends to explore other fashion possibilities. For example, the game &quot;Pia Carrot&quot; is located in a restaurant, in which the girls wear elaborate waitress uniforms.

The female characters frequently act in an endearingly childlike fashion, which is described by the Japanese slang term &quot;moe&quot;, a characteristic that is often looked-for in &quot;bishōjo&quot; characters. The reasons for this characteristic are not always merely sexual: sometimes it is used to present a pretty and affectionate character who is beloved and supported by the player. In fact, &quot;little sisters&quot; are a recurring fixture of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games. A very popular game that emphasizes the characteristic of &quot;moe&quot; is &quot;Sister Princess&quot;, based on the premise of the player acquiring no fewer than twelve little sisters.

The majority of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games involve anime girls and not pictures of real-life girls. Since some characters in &quot;bishōjo&quot; games are minors, the use of drawn characters allows the studios of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games with adult content to avoid the penalty of Japanese child pornography laws, which prohibit the depiction of real minors under 18 years of age. Even so, the EOCS requests that all characters who appear to be minors be labeled as 18 years of age.

===Representation of men===
The main male character in &quot;bishōjo&quot; games is often rendered as someone the player can identify with, thus experiencing the story as he would live an episode of his own life. Often the game is viewed in a first person view of the main character.

Since &quot;bishōjo&quot; games focus on female characters and the player&#x27;s interaction with them, male characters often receive less time on-screen and the character that represents the player rarely appears; when this happens, his face is usually hidden outside the screen or otherwise, and he might not even be voiced. Sometimes the only male appearance in sex scenes is reduced to a penis entering from the side of the screen, with no other visible parts.

==Distribution==
The genre is extremely popular in Japan. It was estimated as late as 2005 that &quot;bishōjo&quot; game sales totaled a quarter of all software produced in Japan. It is estimated that an average 50 new titles are released each month or about 500 annually.

&quot;Bishōjo&quot; games for personal computers are usually sold in special stores or sections reserved for clients more than 18 years old. Nevertheless, console &quot;bishōjo&quot; games, which are generally less explicit, are sold next to other video games. At the present time, dozens of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games are released every month, and practically all the video game stores in Japan maintain a sizable stock of these. The games are initially relatively expensive compared to the Western market of videogames, fluctuating between 8,000 and 10,000 yen (approximately $75–95) each, although soon they can be bought more cheaply second-hand.

==Influence in the West==

While &quot;bishōjo&quot; games are produced in Japan for console market, that is largely not the case in the West, where enthusiasm for the subgenre is lukewarm. What success these games have had has historically been dependent on the related industries of anime and manga. The common visual novel format that make up the majority of translations has been criticized as boring and not actually games.

In addition, the genre has been associated exclusively with poorly written &quot;eroge&quot;. The popular discussion of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games is widely plagued by disagreement and disapproval of pornography. The debate tends to be remarkably divided: on one hand, critics condemn the genre as totally pornographic, while on the other hand, enthusiasts deny this generalization. This question does not cause as much controversy in Japan.

The attempts to massively trade &quot;bishōjo&quot; games in the West have caused a certain degree of public controversy. An example of this is the attempt to release the PC game &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot; in the United States. Though it was never officially released, a few newspapers critically accused the game of sexism. Adding to the uproar was a pre-release screen-capture containing nudity. However, the game is not pornographic; there was some nudity which was already censored by American localizer SoftEgg, and the only way to see any real nudity is through an Easter egg cheat code. &quot;Princess Maker&quot; attracted negative attention due to the fact it was widely promoted as a mainstream video game, unlike other translated games which had been kept in adult-only channels as pornography.

The &quot;dōjinshi&quot; webcomic &quot;Megatokyo&quot;, popular among Western followers of anime, especially in the United States, was inspired in a large extent by dating sims. &quot;Megatokyo&quot; idealizes &quot;bishōjo&quot; games while simultaneously expressing another criticism commonly used in the West against them: that players resort to them as a form of escapism because they are socially inept (This type of criticism is also found in Japan, though in a quite different form: see otaku).

While translations of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games in English remain a relatively niche market confined mostly to the adult genre, elements of the gameplay do exist in a lot of games. &quot;Story of Seasons&quot;, &quot;Persona 3&quot;, the &quot;Rune Factory&quot; series, and other games like them focus on the social interaction and the romancing of attractive anime girls. However, such games also offer much more social ties, even if the gameplay may favor social interaction with females.

=== Cultural transmission ===
Western players can use &quot;bishōjo&quot; games to help orient themselves to the Japanese culture through aspects of telepresence. However, because &quot;bishōjo&quot; games rely heavily on iconic nature, their level of perceptual immersion is diminished in comparison to mediums like virtual reality. Instead, they rely on psychological immersion. These games are constructed around popular culture and other social phenomena of Japan which then combined with immersion and telepresence allows a Western player to get a better idea of what it is like living in Japan. According to Mathew T. Jones of Temple University, Peter Payne, founder of Jast USA, says, &quot;You&#x27;re reaching out and touching a little piece of Japan in the game – you really feel like you&#x27;re experiencing love and life vicariously through the game characters&quot;. By using a first person avatar with Japanese identity, &quot;bishōjo&quot; games offer an unprecedented means of cultural immersion that, according to Jones, travel and live interpersonal communication cannot. This is done by taking on the Japanese identity that allows for an intimate perspective of the Japanese culture while maintaining the ability to make choices throughout the game. In addition, some English translations offer liner notes or in-game text to explain certain Japanese idiosyncrasies.

The knowledge can be broken into five main categories: language; cultural events; stories; media; and sexual culture. In the former, language, common Japanese words become a part of the player&#x27;s vocabulary. In addition, games with Japanese voicing adds an additional level of understanding to the player about the language&#x27;s structure. In addition, major culture events, such as Japanese holidays, are portrayed. The player also comes to understand what stories and legends are known in Japan, both traditional ones and Western ones, and how the latter are seen from a Japanese perspective. Manga titles popular in Japan are frequently referenced in these games and those likely playing the games read many of those manga referenced. Finally, Japanese sexual culture is referenced through the usage of various institutes like love hotels, lingerie pubs and erotic public baths.

==Related terms==
There are a number of terms roughly equivalent to &quot;&quot;bishōjo&quot; game&quot; in use, both in Japanese and English, and there is considerable disagreement and confusion about their proper use. There is no clear consensus on the precise meaning of many of the terms below. The naming difficulties reflect the fluid boundaries of the genre, as well as embarrassment caused by the pornographic nature of some of these games.

In general, &quot;anime game&quot; can be considered the most general term, and other names designate subgenres. Here are the most common terms currently in use:

;&quot;Bishōjo&quot; game, girl game, gal game
:This term designates any game involving pretty anime girls. The Japanese word &quot;bishōjo&quot; literally means &quot;pretty young girl&quot;. &quot;Girl game&quot; and &quot;gal game&quot; are also used to describe these games.
;Boy&#x27;s love game, BL game
:Girls&#x27; &quot;bishōnen&quot; game where teenage boys and young adult males engage in homosexual relationships. Most such games are &quot;visual novels&quot; (see below). See also &quot;Yaoi&quot; game.
;&quot;Otome&quot; game
: A genre which literally means &quot;maiden game&quot;, they are games which are aimed at female players and feature mainly heterosexual relationships. They are sometimes called &quot;reverse harem&quot; or GxB games because the genders of the protagonist and the romanceable characters are the opposite of &quot;bishōjo&quot; games. &quot;Otome&quot; games will occasionally contain lesbian romance as well.
;&quot;Eroge&quot;, H game, Hentai game
:These terms are used in English to designate anime games with explicit erotic or pornographic elements. &quot;H&quot; is a letter used in Japanese to refer to sexual content, and &quot;erogē&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;erotic game&quot;. &quot;Hentai&quot;, meaning &quot;pervert&quot; in Japanese, is not used to describe these games in Japanese, but it is common in English. In Japan, &quot;eroge&quot; are almost always sold for the PC, because console manufacturers such as Sony and Nintendo generally refuse to license pornographic games for their systems.
;Raising sim
:This is a subgenre where the goal is to &quot;raise&quot; a character, training and educating them to improve their (usually numerically quantified) attributes. This resembles role-playing games except that the goal is to improve another character rather than yourself, not unlike a digital pet. The classic example is &quot;Princess Maker&quot;, where the player&#x27;s task is to raise a girl into a queen. Another is the N64 game &quot;Wonder Project J2&quot; with an orphaned robot girl. Many hardcore &quot;eroge&quot; also start from this premise, in which case the character to be &quot;raised&quot; is usually some kind of sexual slave. This subgenre is called .
:A variation of the raising sim genre involves the recruitment and training of pop idols in the guise of a music rhythm game. One popular series of this genre is &quot;The Idolmaster&quot;.
:This term describes games focusing on romantic interactions with anime girls. This term is generally used to describe games which have little or no pornography, or for which erotic content is not the main focus of the game. To describe hardcore pornographic games, &quot;eroge&quot; is preferred. The games are often , or .
;Dating sim
:Strictly speaking, this term designates simulation games focused on dating, the most famous being &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;. However, this term is frequently used by English speakers to describe any romance-driven game, regardless of game mechanics used.
;Visual novel
:This is used to designate a type of game which is particularly story-focused, or containing novel-like narration in its writing. Examples of visual novels include &quot;To Heart&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Clannad&quot;. In Japan such games are generally referred to as , whereas only such type of games with little to no interaction are called (predominantly for adult games) or .

Also, many Japanese games which are not strictly &quot;bishōjo&quot; games contain elements of the genre. Many mainstream Japanese role-playing or fighting games feature attractive anime girls (such as &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; Tifa Lockhart or many of the girls in the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; video game series), but they are usually not considered &quot;bishōjo&quot; games unless this is a central aspect of the game.

<text>Gray Matter Interactive Studios, Inc. (Gray Matter Studios; formerly Xatrix Entertainment, Inc.) was an American video game developer based in Los Angeles.

== History ==
Drew Markham and his business partner Barry Dempsey founded Xatrix Entertainment in March 1993. The studio&#x27;s first release was &quot;Cyberia&quot; in 1994. Among its later projects was &quot;Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning&quot;, for which it worked with publisher Activision. Around 1999, some of the original business partners sought to exit the company. To handle this efficiently, Xatrix was transferred to a new corporation under Markham as creative director. With the assistance of Activision, Gray Matter Studios was established on June 17, 1999, and took over most of the former employees. Activision initially owned 40% of the studio. It bought the remaining 60% in January 2002, after the successful release of &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;. The publisher paid 133,690 shares of common stock, at the time worth around . Post-acquisition, the studio was put to work on the &quot;Call of Duty: United Offensive&quot; expansion. It also worked on &quot;Trinity: The Shatter Effect&quot;, which was announced and then canceled in late 2003. In 2005, during the development of &quot;Call of Duty 2: Big Red One&quot;, Gray Matter Studios was merged into Activision&#x27;s Treyarch studio. As part of Treyarch, the former Gray Matter Studios team worked on &quot;Call of Duty 3&quot;.

<text>Journey to the Center of the Earth (), also translated with the variant titles A Journey to the Centre of the Earth and A Journey into the Interior of the Earth, is a classic science fiction novel written by French novelist Jules Verne. It was first published in French in 1864, then reissued in 1867 in a revised and expanded edition. Professor Otto Lidenbrock is the tale&#x27;s central figure, an eccentric German scientist who believes there are volcanic tubes that reach to the very center of the earth. He, his nephew Axel, and their Icelandic guide Hans rappel into Iceland&#x27;s celebrated inactive volcano Snæfellsjökull, then contend with many dangers, including cave-ins, subpolar tornadoes, an underground ocean, and living prehistoric creatures from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras (the 1867 revised edition inserted additional prehistoric material in Chaps. 37–39). Eventually the three explorers are spewed back to the surface by an active volcano, Stromboli, located in southern Italy.

The category of subterranean fiction existed well before Verne. However his novel&#x27;s distinction lay in its well-researched Victorian science and its inventive contribution to the science-fiction subgenre of time travel—Verne&#x27;s innovation was the concept of a prehistoric realm still existing in the present-day world. &quot;Journey&quot; inspired many later authors, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his novel &quot;The Lost World&quot;, Edgar Rice Burroughs in his &quot;Pellucidar&quot; series, and J. R. R. Tolkien in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

== Plot ==
The story begins in May 1863, at the home of Professor Otto Lidenbrock in Hamburg, Germany. While leafing through an original runic manuscript of an Icelandic saga, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a cyphered note written in runic script along with the name of a 16th-century Icelandic alchemist, Arne Saknussemm. When translated into English, the note reads:

Lidenbrock departs for Iceland immediately, taking the reluctant Axel with him. After a swift trip via Kiel and Copenhagen, they arrive in Reykjavík. There they hire as their guide Icelander Hans Bjelke, a Danish-speaking eiderduck hunter, then travel overland to the base of Snæfellsjökull.

In late June they reach the volcano and set off into the bowels of the earth, encountering many dangers and strange phenomena. After taking a wrong turn, they run short of water and Axel nearly perishes, but Hans saves them all by tapping into a subterranean river, which shoots out a stream of water that Lidenbrock and Axel name the &quot;Hansbach&quot; in the guide&#x27;s honor.
Following the course of the Hansbach, the explorers descend many miles, during which, Axel accidentally gets separated from Lidenbrock and Hans and briefly gets lost in the caverns, but survives a rockslide before being found again. Eventually, the explorers reach an underground world, with an ocean (which Lidenbrock christens the Lidenbrock Sea, after himself) and a vast ceiling with clouds, as well as a permanent Aurora giving light. The travelers build a raft out of semipetrified wood and set sail. On the shoreline, they see the gazelle-like &quot;Leptotherium&quot;, the cattle-like &quot;Merycotherium&quot;, the tapir-like &quot;Lophiodon&quot;, an &quot;Anoplotherium&quot; (which is described to be a compound of a horse, a rhinoceros, a camel, and a hippopotamus), a mastodon, a &quot;Megatherium&quot;, and a &quot;Protopithecus&quot; while a &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; flies in the sky.

While at sea, they encounter prehistoric fish such as &quot;Pterichthyodes&quot; (here called &quot;Pterichthys&quot;) &quot;Dipterus&quot; (referred to as &quot;Dipterides&quot;) and giant marine reptiles from the Age of the Dinosaurs, namely an &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot; and a &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;, in which a fight between the monsters almost endangers the raft. A lightning storm threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the site of an enormous fossil graveyard (which Lidenbrock, at first, thinks is on the coast they&#x27;d departed from, assuming the storm blew them back the way they&#x27;d come), including bones from a &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, a &quot;Megatherium&quot;, a &quot;Deinotherium, a Glyptodon,&quot; a mastodon, and the preserved body of a prehistoric hominid.

Lidenbrock and Axel venture into a forest featuring primitive vegetation from the Tertiary Period. In its depths they are stunned to find a prehistoric humanoid that is described to be more than twelve feet in height with a head that was huge and unshapely like a buffalo, a mane that is similar to a prehistoric elephant that hid most of its head, and wielding a primitive staff. It was watching over a herd of mastodons like a shepherd and surpassed the height of the known prehistoric hominids that Lidenbrock and Axel know. Fearing the humanoid may be hostile, Lidenbrock and Axel leave the forest before it can see them.

Continuing to explore the coastline, the travellers find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead, but it has been blocked by a recent cave-in. The adventurers lay plans to blow the rock open with gun cotton, meanwhile paddling their raft out to sea to avoid the blast. On executing this scheme, they open a bottomless pit beyond the impeding rock and are swept into it as the sea rushes down the huge open gap. After spending hours descending at breakneck speed, their raft reverses direction and rises inside a volcanic chimney that ultimately spews them into the open air. When they regain consciousness, they learn that they have been ejected from Stromboli, a volcanic island located off Sicily.

The trio returns to Germany, where they enjoy great acclaim; Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of the day, Axel discovers that the poles on the compass got reversed during the storm and marries his sweetheart Gräuben, and Hans returns to his peaceful, eiderduck-hunting life in Iceland.

== Main characters ==
* Professor Otto Lidenbrock: a hot-tempered geologist at the Johanneum Gymnasium with radical ideas.
* Axel: Lidenbrock&#x27;s nephew, a young student whose ideas are more cautious.
* Hans Bjelke: Icelandic eiderduck hunter who hires on as their guide; resourceful and imperturbable.
* Gräuben: Lidenbrock&#x27;s goddaughter, with whom Axel is in love; from Vierlande (region southeast of Hamburg).
* Martha: Lidenbrock&#x27;s housekeeper and cook.

== Publication notes ==
The original French editions of 1864 and 1868 were issued by J. Hetzel et Cie, a major Paris publishing house owned by Pierre-Jules Hetzel.

The novel&#x27;s first English edition, translated by an unknown hand and published in 1871 by the London house Griffith &amp; Farran, appeared under the title &quot;A Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; and is now available at Project Gutenberg. A drastically rewritten version of the story, it adds chapter titles where Verne gives none, meanwhile changing the professor&#x27;s surname to Hardwigg, Axel&#x27;s name to Harry, and Gräuben&#x27;s to Gretchen. In addition, many paragraphs and details are completely recomposed.

An 1877 London edition from Ward, Lock, &amp; Co. appeared under the title &quot;A Journey into the Interior of the Earth&quot;. Its translation, credited to Frederick Amadeus Malleson, is more faithful than the Griffith &amp; Farran version, though it, too, concocts chapter titles and modifies details. Its text is likewise available at Project Gutenberg.

There are 2 modern English translations by Frank Wynne, edited by p. W. Gogman of Penguin Classics in 2009 and by Matthew G. Jonas in 2022.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film ===
* 1959: &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, USA, directed by Henry Levin, starring James Mason and Pat Boone, distributed by 20th Century Fox. The film transfers Verne&#x27;s beginning locale from Hamburg to Edinburgh, &quot;Professor Otto Lidenbrock&quot; becomes &quot;Professor Oliver Lindenbrook&quot;, and Axel becomes earth-sciences student Alec McEwan. Special effects are sometimes perfunctory, modern lizards being used to portray Verne&#x27;s prehistoric creatures — Rhinoceros iguanas, for instance, are decked out in a paste-on Sail-like dorsal fin to represent &quot;Dimetrodons&quot;. The film also introduces a new subplot and two additional main characters: a female explorer (Arlene Dahl) and a villainous antagonist (Thayer David). 
* 1978: &quot;Viaje al centro de la Tierra&quot;, Spain, directed by Juan Piquer Simón, starring Kenneth More and . It was distributed in both the U.S. in theaters as &quot;Where Time Began&quot; and the U.K. on TV as &quot;The Fabulous Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;.
* The surname of Kathy Ireland&#x27;s character in &quot;Alien from L.A.&quot; (1988), a film about a girl who falls through the Earth and discovers a repressive subterranean society, is Saknussemm.
* 1989: &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; took only the title and general concept from the Verne novel, offering a new storyline aimed at a teen audience. It was written by Debra Ricci, Regina Davis, Kitty Chalmers, and Rusty Lemorande, and was directed by Lemorande and Albert Pyun. It stars Emo Philips, Paul Carafotes, Jaclyn Bernstein, Kathy Ireland, Janet Du Plessis, Nicola Cowper, Lochner De Kock, and Ilan Mitchell-Smith. 
* 2008: &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; is a 3-D film by Eric Brevig. Cast members include Brendan Fraser, Anita Briem, and Josh Hutcherson. The film is a modern-day paraphrase of the 1860s original — it uses Verne&#x27;s book as its inciting incident instead of Saknussemm&#x27;s message, then follows the novel&#x27;s overall structure with fidelity: a geology professor, his nephew, and an Icelandic guide (now a woman named &quot;Hannah&quot;) penetrate Snaefells, discover a seashore with giant mushrooms, sail across an underground ocean inhabited by a pod of &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot;, a relative of the plesiosaurus, and reach the other side where they encounter a terrestrial animal from prehistory, in this case a &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, a predatory theropod dinosaur rather than a mastodon. Ultimately the three explorers exit the heating underworld via an erupting volcano, find themselves in present-day Italy, and return to their starting point in academia.
* 2008: &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; was a direct-to-DVD release by The Asylum, also released as &quot;Journey to Middle Earth&quot; in the United Kingdom. Starring Greg Evigan as Joseph Harnet and Dedee Pfeiffer as Emily Radford, it&#x27;s a low-budget adaptation, which, as with most Asylum films, was apparently released to draft off of the Eric Brevig film.

=== Television ===
* An animated television series, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, first broadcast in 1967 on ABC, starring the voices of Ted Knight, Pat Harrington, Jr., and Jane Webb; loosely based on Verne&#x27;s novel and closer to the 1959 film.
* The first half of the animated television series &quot;Willy Fog 2&quot; (1994–95), the sequel of &quot;Around the World with Willy Fog&quot;, produced by Spanish studio BRB Internacional and Televisión Española, is based on &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot;. BRB Internacional heavily edited that first half of the series down to a truncated 75 minutes direct-to-video film later.
* A limited animation television special in the &quot;Famous Classic Tales&quot; series was aired by CBS in 1977.
* In 1993, NBC aired a made-for-TV film version with a cast including John Neville, F. Murray Abraham and Kim Miyori. The film used the title and general premise of Verne&#x27;s novel, but had its heroes carry out the journey in an earth-penetrating machine borrowed from Burroughs. 
* The &quot;Wishbone&quot; 1996 episode &quot;Hot Diggety Dawg&quot; followed the novel and featured several major scenes identifying the central character as Professor Lidenbrock.
* The 37th episode of &quot;The Triplets&quot;, called &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, makes reference to this novel.
* The 1999 Hallmark Entertainment miniseries starred Treat Williams, Jeremy London, Bryan Brown, Tushka Bergen, and Hugh Keays-Byrne. This version deviates massively from Verne&#x27;s original.
* The 2001 animated television series &quot;Ultimate Book of Spells&quot; references the novel, as the main protagonists are sent on adventures through the centre of the Earth with the titular object. It was originally planned to be named after the book in general, but was changed.
* &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; was a 2008 American-Canadian TV film from RHI Entertainment. Starring Rick Schroder, Peter Fonda, Victoria Pratt, Steven Grayhm, and Mike Dopud, it was shot in and around Vancouver during the summer of 2007. 
* The 2012 episode &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot;, from &quot;Ben &amp; Holly&#x27;s Little Kingdom&quot;, makes reference to the novel. In it, the naughty twins Daisy and Poppy magically send Mrs. Fotheringill to the center of the earth, and it&#x27;s up to Grandpapa Thistle to guide Ben, Holly and their family there on a rescue mission.
* Slim film+television and Federation Entertainment will produce an upcoming television series adaptation, developed by Ashley Pharoah.

=== Radio ===
* A seven-part radio serial was broadcast on the BBC Home Service in 1962. It was produced by Claire Chovil, and starred Trevor Martin and Nigel Anthony.
* An eight-part radio serial was produced for BBC Radio 4 by Howard Jones in 1963. It starred Bernard Horsfall and Jeffrey Banks.
* A radio drama adaptation was broadcast by National Public Radio in 2000 for its series &quot;Radio Tales&quot;.
* A 90-minute radio adaptation by Stephen Walker directed by Owen O&#x27;Callan was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 28 December 1995, and rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 20 November 2011, on 11 and 12 November 2012, and on 20 and 21 December 2014. Nicholas Le Prevost stars as Professor Otto Lidenbrock, Nathaniel Parker as Axel, and Oliver Senton as Hans. Kristen Millwood plays Rosemary McNab, a new character who funds and accompanies the expedition.
* A two-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Earth&quot; broadcast on 19 and 26 March 2017. Featuring Stephen Critchlow as Professor Lidenbrock, Joel MacCormack as Axel, and Gudmundur Ingi Thorvaldsson as Hans, it was directed and produced by Tracey Neale and adapted by Moya O&#x27;Shea.

=== Theme park (themed areas) and rides ===
* A high speed dark ride attraction themed after the novel, Journey to the Center of the Earth, operates at the Tokyo DisneySea theme park in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan. It is located in the Verne-inspired Mysterious Island area of the park which also includes a dark ride based on &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;.
* Le Visionarium (Timekeeper), featuring Jules Verne in a circle vision ride (1992–2005) and Space Mountain, de la Terre à la Lune, in its original version (1995–2005), based directly on &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; in Discoveryland (the hub facing part of the Land features steampunk-related theming) at Euro Disneyland (now Disneyland Paris) between 1992 and 2005

<text>Gobliiins is a puzzle adventure video game series, consisting of five entries, released by Coktel Vision (and later Sierra On-Line) for the Amiga, Atari ST, DOS, Macintosh, iOS and Windows platforms. The first three titles were released in the early 1990s, the fourth in 2009, and fifth in 2023. The visual look of the series and its characters were created by French artist Pierre Gilhodes, whose style was used in another game from Coktel Vision: &quot;Woodruff and the Schnibble of Azimuth&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The games mix elements of adventure and puzzle gaming. In essence, the player must find the solution to each area (or level), consisting of one or more screens, in order to progress to the next.

An original aspect of the series is that the player usually controls multiple goblins as player characters, each of whom has a unique set of abilities. In the title, the number of letters &#x27;i&#x27; in the word &quot;Goblin&quot; indicates the number of characters that the player may control: &quot;Gobliiins&quot; for the first release (1991), &quot;Gobliins 2&quot; for the second (1992), &quot;Goblins Quest 3&quot; for the third (1993), &quot;Gobliiins 4&quot; for the fourth (2009), and &quot;Gobliiins 5&quot; for the fifth (2023). The player may only control one character at a time but, depending on the specific scene, may switch characters at will. The original &quot;Gobliiins&quot; features a shared health system for all three characters, which means that leaving characters in the wrong place can be detrimental, though this feature is absent in the sequels.

All games are available in CD format, except for the fifth which was released on digital distribution service Steam. The first three include voices instead of the &quot;goblinish&quot; talk that feature on the floppy disk versions. The CD version also censors the nudity present in the original game. The platinum edition of &quot;Gobliiins 4&quot; contains all previous titles with a modification of ScummVM for newer Windows systems. All older games on the DVD were also translated from the original English and French language into Spanish, German, Italian, Russian, Polish, Czech and Hungarian.

==Games==
===&quot;Gobliiins&quot; (1991)===

In &quot;Gobliiins&quot;, the player controls a team of three different goblins, each with a unique skill. The first goblin, Asgard (BoBo in the US release), is a warrior who is more brawn than brain, and whose skill is punching, causing various things to break or fall over. He is also the only one who can climb other objects than stairs and ladders. The second goblin, Ignatius (US: Hooter), is a magician who can &quot;zap&quot; things with magic with a wide variety of usually unexpected effects, which include objects moving, growing, or coming alive. The third, Oups (US: Dwayne), is a technician and is the only one of the three that can pick up and use items.

The story follows the three goblins as they attempt to aid their king, who has gone insane under mysterious circumstances. They meet with the wizard Niak, who informs them he can cure the king&#x27;s madness if they bring him three items. However, upon obtaining the items, Niak is revealed to be the one behind the king&#x27;s insanity and manipulated the goblins into performing his bidding. The goblins manage to escape from Niak&#x27;s lair, save the king by destroying the voodoo doll used to drive him insane, and defeat Niak while he is creating deadly potions.

The game is linear and consists of 22 levels, each of which occupies a single screen. The puzzles on each level must be successfully solved in order to progress to the next.

Several actions may harm the goblin involved, including leaving them in an unsafe place, using incorrect items, or interacting with items with the wrong characters, thus reducing their shared life meter. When the meter runs out, the game ends in defeat (though all levels can be completed without loss of life).

====Reception====
&quot;Powerplay&quot; gave the game a rating of 70% for the PC version and 69% for the Amiga and Atari ST versions. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated in January 1993 that although the game seemed designed to appeal to younger players, the difficulty of the puzzles made it most appropriate for older gamers, either alone or with children. The magazine concluded that the game &quot;will entertain a variety of light-hearted gamers&quot;. In April 1994 the magazine said that &quot;Gobliiins Multimedia CD&quot; &quot;was ever so cute and challenging&quot;, with a &quot;much improved sound track&quot;. In February 1993 &quot;Dragon&quot; rated the game 5 out of 5 stars. The game made its debut on iOS in September 2011, brought by publisher Bulkypix.

===&quot;Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon&quot; (1992)===
In &quot;Gobliins 2&quot; the player controls two characters: Fingus (who is well-mannered, intelligent, and shy) and Winkle (who is strong, obnoxious, but dimwitted). They have been sent to rescue the King&#x27;s son, the Prince Buffoon, who has been kidnapped by the evil Amoniak. Both goblins can pick up and use items, and both generally use an item in different ways. Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Gobliins 2&quot; allows (and requires) the player to travel back and forth between rooms. Also, both goblins can be given an order simultaneously, allowing for the inclusion of timing puzzles. A significant difference between this game and its predecessor is that in &quot;Gobliins 2&quot; neither playable character can die.

====Reception====
&quot;Gobliins 2&quot; received generally good reviews, with most game magazines giving it a rating of between 70% and 90%, though CU Amiga scored it at just 40%. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in August 1993 praised its &quot;challenging puzzles, sharp-witted entertainment, and enhanced ease of use&quot;. In April 1994 the magazine said that the sequel was &quot;no less entertaining than the original&quot;, and that the CD version added &quot;much more sound and digitized voice-acting than in the enhanced version of the first game&quot;.

===&quot;Goblins Quest 3&quot; (1993)===
&quot;Goblins Quest 3&quot; was originally known as just &quot;Goblins 3&quot;, but after Sierra got involved they decided to add the &quot;Quest&quot; suffix in an attempt to align the game with their other Quest series: &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Police Quest&quot; and &quot;Space Quest&quot;.

In this game the player controls originally only one Goblin called Blount, but gets assistance from a number of sidekicks throughout the game including Chump the parrot, Ooya the magician, and Fulbert the snake. Blount is also bitten by a wolf early in the game and, after escaping from the afterlife, must contend with semi-frequent metamorphoses into a super-strong but uncouth werewolf alter ego. Most areas in &quot;Goblins 3&quot; are larger than the screen and therefore scroll. The game features 18 different levels, and like &quot;Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon&quot;, some are interconnected to each other (e.g., walking from the countryside to the inn) whilst others cannot be exited until the player has finished that specific level. Later in the game, the player discovers that the main protagonist, Blount, was in fact the little prince that was kidnapped in &quot;Gobliins 2: The Prince Buffoon&quot;.

====Reception====
The gaming press awarded broadly positive reviews, with scores ranging from around 75% to 85%, though—as it did with its predecessor &quot;Gobliins 2&quot;—CU Amiga awarded a lower score of just 53%. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said in June 1994 that like the previous games, &quot;&quot;Goblins Quest 3&quot; is designed to thoroughly amuse ... Puzzle lovers are guaranteed an enjoyably bizarre experience&quot;. The magazine rated the game 3.5 stars out of five in July, stating that unlike the earlier games it had plot twists and other adventure game-like elements, and &quot;bright, expressive&quot; VGA graphics, but shared their humor. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; concluded that it would be a good game for new adventurers, and all players would enjoy the &quot;charming characters and goofy plot elements&quot;.

In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Goblin&#x27;s Quest 3&quot; the 42nd best computer game ever. The following year, the magazine presented &quot;Goblins Quest 3&quot; with its 1994 &quot;Best Puzzle Game&quot; award, writing that its puzzles will challenge and delight even the most experienced gamers.

===&quot;Gobliiins 4&quot; (2009)===
&quot;Gobliiins 4&quot; was released in March 2009 and stars the same trio of characters as the original Gobliiins. The game was designed by Pierre Gilhodes and Muriel Tramis, developed by Société Pollene and produced by the Russian company Snowball Studios. Compared to the previous games it boasts 3D graphics, but the game mechanics have not changed by much. The game received a slightly mixed reception, with an average of 56.5% on GameRankings. IT Reviews said it was entertaining, but &quot;the puzzle solutions can be annoyingly strait-jacketed at times&quot;. &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; rated it 80% and called it &quot;one of the most likeable titles this year&quot;.

===&quot;Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion&quot; (2023)===
The fifth game in the series, &quot;Gobliiins 5: The Morgloton Invasion&quot;, was released in 2023, initially on Itch.io in May and on Steam in July. The game had successful crowdfunding campaigns on French crowdfunding site Ulule and on Kickstarter. 

It features the original three goblins from the first episode - Oups, Asgard and Ignatius - on a mission to find out the source of a mysterious magic ray that turns people in to anthropomorphic potatoes. The game was developed using Adventure Game Studio. While the game features a return to a more level-based format consisting of 16 levels, with usually the action being restricted on a single screen at a time, it continues the tradition of no game over.

==Legacy==
On &quot;Playtoons 1: Uncle Archibald&quot;, the little dragon from &quot;Goblins Quest 3&quot; appeared in the story mode and in the creative mode.

<text>Katherine Kelly Lang (born Katherine Kelly Wegeman; July 25, 1961) is an American actress. She is best known for playing Brooke Logan in the CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; of the CBS Daytime programming block.

== Early life ==
Lang was born in Hollywood, California, and graduated from Beverly Hills High School. She is the daughter of Olympic ski jumper Keith R. Wegeman, a German-American and actress Judith Lang, an Anglo-American and the granddaughter of Oscar-winning cinematographer Charles Lang.

==Career==
Lang made her acting debut in the film &quot;Skatetown, U.S.A.&quot; (1979), alongside Scott Baio, Maureen McCormick, and Patrick Swayze. That was followed by guest roles in numerous television series such as &quot;The Powers of Matthew Star&quot;, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; and &quot;1st &amp; Ten&quot;. Lang starred in the 1996 television film &quot;Subliminal Seduction&quot;. In 1985, she appeared in four music videos: Alabama&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s No Way&quot; (where she played the love interest of Alabama lead singer Randy Owen) The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Getcha Back&quot; and its sequel &quot;It&#x27;s Gettin&#x27; Late&quot; and The Medflys&#x27; &quot;Compulsive&quot; for a band from her childhood hometown, Carmel CA.

In 1987, Lang was offered the role of blue-collar Brooke Logan on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; for the CBS Daytime programming block, and has been an integral part of the program ever since. Her love affair with Ridge Forrester (originally played by Ronn Moss, and since 2013 by Thorsten Kaye) has been a key story arc for 35 years, and a love triangle among Brooke, Ridge and Taylor (Originally played by Hunter Tylo and later Krista Allen and Rebecca Budig) stretched over more than thirty years starting with Taylor&#x27;s entrance to the show in 1990. The show&#x27;s 5,000th episode included only the four core characters: Brooke, Ridge, Stephanie and Eric. As of February 2015, Lang is one of only two actors to be on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; throughout the series. The other is John McCook, who portrays Eric Forrester.

In 1999, she appeared as Brooke in &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, interacting with Eric Braeden (Victor), Peter Bergman (Jack), and Eileen Davidson (Ashley). Lang previously appeared on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Gretchen in 1981, and returned to the soap, for a brief stint, in July 2007. Her work as Brooke has been recognized with seven Soap Opera Digest Award nominations, beginning in 1991 and most recently in 2005.

In 2016, Lang made a special guest appearance as herself in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; on 10 Peach. In January 2019, she returned to Australian television as a contestant on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; for season 5. In October 2019 she made a guest appearance on the Greek soap opera &quot;8 lexeis&quot; for SKAI TV. She played Grace Heart, a reporter who traveled from New York, to Corfu, Greece, only that was not her true identity!

==Personal life==
Lang has been married twice. She is the mother of three children from her two marriages: her two sons Jeremy Skott Snider (born 1990), Julian Lang Snider (born 1992) from her then husband Skott Snider, and her daughter Zoe Katrina D&#x27;Andrea (born 1997) from her then husband Alex D&#x27;Andrea, and has a stepdaughter, Danyelle D&#x27;Andrea (born 1991).

On November 11, 2012, it was announced that Lang had filed for divorce, after 15 years of marriage citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. The divorce was finalized in June 2014.

In May 2018, she became a grandmother with the birth of her granddaughter, Zuma, via her daughter Zoe.

<text>Infinity Ward, Inc. is an American video game developer. They developed the video game &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, along with seven other installments in the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series. Vince Zampella, Grant Collier, and Jason West established Infinity Ward in 2002 after working at 2015, Inc. previously. All of the 22 original team members of Infinity Ward came from the team that had worked on &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot; while at 2015, Inc. Activision helped fund Infinity Ward in its early days, buying up 30 percent of the company, before eventually fully acquiring them. The studio&#x27;s first game, World War II shooter &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, was released on the PC in 2003. The day after the game was released, Activision bought the rest of Infinity Ward, signing employees to long-term contracts. Infinity Ward went on to make &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare&quot;, the &quot;Modern Warfare&quot; reboot, and its sequel.

Co-founder Collier left the company in early 2009 to join parent company Activision. In 2010, West and Zampella were fired by Activision for &quot;breaches of contract and insubordination&quot;, they soon founded a game studio called Respawn Entertainment. On May 3, 2014, Neversoft was merged into Infinity Ward.

==History==
Infinity Ward was founded as an independent game studio by Grant Collier, Jason West, and Vince Zampella in 2002, with a publishing agreement with Activision. The studio was formed by several members of 2015 Games, LLC., the studio that developed the successful &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot; for Electronic Arts (EA) in 2002. Dissatisfied with the current contract they had under EA, Collier, West, and Zampella engaged with Activision to help establish Infinity Ward, which became one of the primary studios within Activision for the competing &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series. Initially, Activision provided Infinity Ward for 30% stake in the company to start development on the first game &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, acquiring full ownership in October 2003 after the title was successfully launched. During this period, the studio was about 25 employees including many who followed Collier, West, and Zampella from 2015. Activision allowed Infinity Ward a great deal of freedom in how it developed its titles.

Shortly after this release, Microsoft contacted Activision to seek a &quot;Call of Duty&quot; title as a launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360 console. Infinity Ward agreed to prepare &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot; for release in the last quarter of 2005. Collier said the request would help them lose the stigma of being only a personal computer developer, and so to make sure the console version was on parity, they tripled their staff to about 75 employees. Much of the focus of Infinity Ward&#x27;s development was improving its game engine to include realistic special effects, such as smoke grenades to hinder sight, or bullets piercing through weak materials. &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot; was a major success, having an 85% attach rate to new Xbox 360 console sales, and selling 1.4 million units its first year. At this point, Activision brought in Treyarch, one of their internal studios, to help develop additional &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games, with Infinity Ward spending the time and effort to improve the game&#x27;s engine for one game, and Treyarch using the updated engine to create a new title. Treyarch released the next sequel &quot;Call of Duty 3&quot; while Infinity Ward itself developed &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;, which instead of taking place during World War II, was set in a contemporary period with a fictional conflict between superpowers. At the time of &quot;Modern Warfare&quot;″s release, Infinity Ward had more than 100 employees.

===2010 employee firings and departures===
Following the critical and financially successful release of &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; in 2007, Jason West (president, co-CCO, and CTO) and Vince Zampella (CEO) began contract negotiations with Activision. They promised to deliver &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; in 2009, but in exchange asked for extremely large bonuses and creative control of the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series. Activision agreed, but added a clause to the contract that should they be fired, the rights to &quot;Call of Duty&quot; would fall back to Activision.

Following the execution of the contract in 2008, Activision began seeking ways to find reason to fire West and Zampella to trigger the new clause. This in turn led to West and Zampella look to means to make Infinity Ward a studio outside of Activision&#x27;s control. Events came to a head in February 2010 when Activision hired a lawfirm to investigate Infinity Ward. On March 1, 2010, West and Zampella were released by Activision for &quot;insubordination&quot;, forfeiting the bonuses they had negotiated. The pair went on to form Respawn Entertainment in April 2010 as an independent studio, through working closely with EA on a yet-announced project (revealed in 2013 as Titanfall). Several dozen of Infinity Ward&#x27;s employees resigned in the following months, many taking up positions at Respawn.

West and Zampella had been replaced on an interim basis by Activision CTO Steve Pearce and head of production Steve Ackrich. By November 2010, Activision had installed new management at Infinity Ward, and Vivendi chairman and CEO Jean-Bernard Lévy stated that Infinity Ward &quot;got over&quot; their problems and are fully reconstructed and that Activision is very happy with the result. The executive went on to say that there will be three studios working on the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; franchise including the newly formed studio Sledgehammer Games.

Several lawsuits followed in the wake of West and Zampella&#x27;s departure. The pair themselves initially filed suit against Activision shortly after their release to reclaim &quot;substantial royalty payments&quot; that Activision failed to pay them in the weeks leading up to their firing, estimated to be ; this figure eventually rose to over by May 2012, based on Activision&#x27;s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Activision countersued the pair in April 2010, calling their actions to fire them justified and asserting the two were &quot;self-serving schemers&quot;. Activision amended its suit in December 2010 to include EA as a defendant, stating that their competitor had worked with West and Zampella to &quot;destabilize, disrupt and ... destroy Infinity Ward&quot;, and sought in damages. Separately, several former and current members of Infinity Ward under the name &quot;Infinity Ward Employee Group&quot; (IWEG) sued Activision for between for unpaid bonuses for work on &quot;Modern Warfare 2&quot; and an additional in punitive damages. Ultimately by May 2012, Activision had settled with the IWEG for , while private settlements were separately reached between Activision and EA, and between Activision, West and Zampella.

===2012 departure of Robert Bowling===

On March 27, 2012, Robert Bowling resigned as creative strategist of &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and a lead employee at Infinity Ward. In response, Activision issued a statement thanking Bowling for his service. When questioned about his department, Bowling responded &quot;Too much &#x27;pew pew&#x27; not enough new new&quot;. Signs of disagreement between Bowling and Infinity Ward arose in an interview in February 2012 when he stated: &quot;I feel like we are in a fucking era where everyone is so focused on subscriber numbers and all that stuff that we need to get back to what I feel like we did so much better in the old days of just plain good will, like stuff like the LAN patch, yeah it is lower priority but let&#x27;s get it out the fucking door. Let&#x27;s just do it.&quot;

===Neversoft merger and further expansion===
In May 2014, Neversoft was merged with Infinity Ward to form a single &#x27;super-studio&#x27; after both collaborated on the development of &quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot;. Neversoft studio head Joel Jewett and studio director Scott Pease retired shortly after the completion of the merger. By March 2015, Infinity Ward had over 250 employees.

Infinity Ward presently operates in five locations – California, Texas, Poland, Mexico and Spain. The studio in Kraków, Poland opened in December 2017. The studio serves as a research and development center, and is headed by principal rendering engineer Michal Drobot. The Poland studio assisted in rebuilding the IW engine for the 2019 reboot of &quot;Modern Warfare&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone&quot;. In October 2021, Infinity Ward opened a new studio in Austin, Texas. In June 2023, Infinity Ward continued to expand with its fifth location, opening a studio in Barcelona, Spain to continue supporting &quot;Modern Warfare&quot; as well as assisting development in &quot;Warzone Mobile&quot;.

==Reception==

Infinity Ward&#x27;s first title, &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, won 90 Game of the Year awards and 50 Editor&#x27;s Choice Awards. It also continues to be among the highest-rated games, according to GameRankings. &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; enjoyed massive commercial and critical success, selling over 13 million copies from its release in November 2007 through May 2009.

In 2010, Infinity Ward was ranked third by Develop 100 only running up to developer Nintendo and Bungie for the top 100 developers based on the sales of their games in the UK.

Infinity Ward&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, earned over $550 million in sales in its first five days on the market, with $310 million of those sales made in the first 24 hours after the game&#x27;s release.

The sequel to &quot;Modern Warfare 2&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;, sold 6.5 million copies in the US and UK alone and grossed $400 million within 24 hours of going on sale.

==Game engines==
Infinity Ward used an enhanced version of the id Tech 3 engine from Quake III Arena for the first &quot;Call of Duty&quot; in 2003. For &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot;, Infinity Ward heavily modified the engine, featuring more powerful visuals and DirectX 9 support, and was known internally as the &quot;IW&quot; game engine. The version that was used for &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot; was designated as IW 2.0. &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; runs on a highly upgraded version of the engine from &quot;Call of Duty 2&quot; dubbed &quot;IW 3.0&quot;, with features that include true world-dynamic lighting, HDR lighting effects, dynamic shadows and depth of field. The &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; sub-series and the James Bond video game &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; were developed by Treyarch using modified versions of Infinity Ward&#x27;s engine.

&quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, uses an upgraded engine dubbed &quot;IW 4.0&quot;, which is a generation more advanced than the engine used in &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;. &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot; uses IW 5.0 (MW3 Engine), an improved version of the IW 4.0 engine. Improvements on the engine allow better streaming technology which allows larger regions for the game while running at a minimum of 60 frames per second, improvements to the audio of the engine have also been made.

&quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot; features an upgraded next-generation version of the IW 5.0 seen in &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;. IW 6.0 is compatible with next-gen systems such as Xbox One and PlayStation 4 so polygon counts, texture detail and overall graphical fidelity has been increased. IW 6.0 is also compatible with Microsoft Windows, Wii U, PS3 and Xbox 360. The IW 6.0 engine features technology from Pixar, SubD, which increases the level of detail of models as one gets closer to them. Mark Rubin has said about the HDR lighting &quot;We used to paint it in and cover up the cracks, but now it&#x27;s all real-time&quot;. &quot;Ghosts&quot; uses Iris Adjust tech which allows the player to experience from a person&#x27;s point of view how their eyes would react to changes in lighting conditions realistically. Other features include new animation systems, fluid dynamics, interactive smoke, displacement mapping and dynamic multiplayer maps. &quot;Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare&quot;&#x27;s IW 7.0 features weightlessness system, game physics improvement, improved AI and improved non-player characters behaviors.

&quot;Modern Warfare&quot; (2019 reboot) and &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone&quot; uses a heavily rebuilt IW engine for the series, allowing for the use of more detailed environments, advanced photogrammetry and rendering, better volumetric lighting, and the use of ray tracing. The new engine had been in development five years prior to the release of the game, and was a collaborative effort between the main Infinity Ward studio in California and the new studio in Poland.

&quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II&quot; uses a highly upgraded version of the engine first used in 2019&#x27;s &quot;Modern Warfare&quot;. The engine is co-developed by Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games, and will be used in future installments of the series in a unified effort to ensure that every studio is working with the same tools.

She was a founding member of the Yes for Wales Cross-party group, which campaigned for the Assembly to be established.

=== European Parliament ===

In 1990, Morgan worked as a stagiaire in the European Parliament for the Socialist Group.

In 1994, Morgan was elected as a Member of the European Parliament representing Mid and West Wales. At the time she was the youngest MEP when she took up her seat. She continued as an MEP representing the Wales constituency, being elected at both the 1999 and 2004 elections, before standing down at the 2009 elections.

Eluned Morgan served as the budget control spokesperson for the 180 strong Socialist Group. She was also the Labour Party&#x27;s European spokesperson on Energy, Industry and Science. She was responsible for drafting the European Parliament&#x27;s response to the Energy Green Paper and also took the lead role in negotiating on behalf of the Parliament the revision of the Electricity Directive.

=== House of Lords ===
On 19 November 2010 it was announced that Morgan had been granted a life peerage and would sit on the Labour benches of the House of Lords, and was gazetted on 27 January 2011 as Baroness Morgan of Ely in the City of Cardiff. From 2013–2016, Morgan served as the Shadow Minister for Wales in the House of Lords, and from 2014 to 2016 she served as Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and also as a whip. She was responsible for leading for Labour in the House of Lords on the EU Referendum Bill and led for Labour on two Wales Bills.

Morgan is currently on a leave of absence from the House of Lords.

=== Senedd and Welsh Government ===
In 2015 Morgan was selected as a candidate for the 2016 Welsh election on the Mid and West Wales regional list. On 5 May 2016 she was elected from the regional list as an Assembly Member in the Senedd.

In November 2017 she was appointed Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning. She contested the 2018 Welsh Labour leadership election, but was not successful, coming third. She was then appointed by First Minister Mark Drakeford as Minister for International Relations and the Welsh Language in December 2018 before being moved to Minister for Mental Health, Wellbeing and the Welsh Language in October 2020.

Morgan was re-elected at the 2021 Senedd election, and a week later was appointed Minister for Health and Social Services. In March 2023, the Welsh Conservatives submitted a motion of no confidence in her, following mounting criticism of Morgan&#x27;s handling of the Betsi Cadwaladr crisis. The motion was defeated, with 26 votes in favor and 29 against.

Morgan endorsed Vaughan Gething in the February–March 2024 Welsh Labour leadership election. She retained her role as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care in the Gething government.

====Leader of Welsh Labour====
In July 2024, Morgan announced that she would be standing in the July 2024 Welsh Labour leadership election on a unity ticket with Huw Irranca-Davies, who would serve as her deputy first minister if she was elected leader. On 24 July 2024, she was confirmed to be the only candidate that met the 5 nomination threshold, and was therefore elected as leader of Welsh Labour.

=== First Minister of Wales (2024–present) ===
On 6 August 2024, Eluned Morgan was officially sworn in as the First Minister of Wales, following her nomination by the Senedd, which was recalled from its summer recess for this purpose. As the leader of the largest party in the Senedd, Morgan secured the position with 28 votes, marking the beginning of her tenure as Wales&#x27; first female First Minister.

Upon entering government as the first minister, one of the first issues to face Morgan was the prospect of the 2024 United Kingdom riots beginning in Wales. In a statement, Morgan said that she was &quot;not complacent&quot;, further adding that Wales was a &quot;society and a nation that should be welcoming people... we cannot let those people who are determined to be destructive within our communities to get a hold&quot;. 

Shortly after taking office, First Minister Eluned Morgan met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Cardiff during his visit to Wales. The meeting focused on &quot;resetting the relationship&quot; between the UK and Welsh governments. Key topics included NHS funding, energy independence, and the future of Tata Steel jobs in Wales. They also discussed the development of renewable energy through the Welsh Government&#x27;s initiative, Trydan Gwyrdd Cymru, aimed at producing clean energy and creating skilled jobs in Wales.

On 2 October 2024, she was sworn into the Privy Council.

<text>Aelius Donatus (; fl. mid-fourth century AD) was a Roman grammarian and teacher of rhetoric. 

He once taught Jerome, an early Christian Church father who is most known for his translation of the Bible into Latin, known as the Latin Vulgate. Newer revisions of the Vulgate are still in common use by the Catholic Church.

==Works==
He was the author of a number of professional works, of which several are extant:

*Ars maior – A commentary on Latin grammar.
* Ars minor – A commentary on parts of Latin Speech.
* Commentvm Terenti, Publii Terentii Comoediae Sex with preface de tragoedia et comoedia (Commentary on Terence, Six Comedies of Terence with the preface About Tragedies and Comedies) – A commentary on the playwright Terence and all six of his plays, probably compiled from other commentaries. The preface is a commentary on the &quot;proper&quot; structures of Tragedies and Comedies by Donatus titled, &quot;About Comedies and Tragedies.&quot; It has never been translated to English as parts are missing from the original manuscript. It has partially been translated to German.
* Explicatio in Ciceronis De inventione (An Explanation of the Cicero&#x27;s De Inventione)
* Vita Vergili (Life of Virgil) is thought to be based on a lost &quot;Vita&quot; by Suetonius, together with the preface and introduction of his commentary on Virgil&#x27;s works. A greatly expanded version of Servius&#x27; commentary exists, however, which is supplemented with frequent and extensive extracts from what is thought to be Donatus&#x27; commentary on Virgil.
** Since the book is supposedly based on a Vita by Suetonius, it is also often titled &quot;Vita Suetonii vulgo Donatiana&quot; [&quot;The Life [of Virgil], [actually] by Suetonius, [but] commonly called &#x27;by Donatus&#x27;&quot;], or &quot;Vita Suetoniana-Donatiana&quot;.
Donatus was a proponent of an early system of punctuation, consisting of dots placed in three successively higher positions to indicate successively longer pauses, roughly equivalent to the modern comma, colon, and full stop. This system remained current through the seventh century, when a more refined system created by Isidore of Seville gained prominence.

In &quot;About Comedy and Tragedy&quot; in his Commentary on Terence, Donatus was the first person known to document the system whereby a play is made up of three separate parts: protasis, epitasis, and catastrophe.

Aelius Donatus should not be confused with Tiberius Claudius Donatus, also the author of a commentary (&quot;Interpretationes&quot;) on the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, who lived about 50 years later.

== &quot;Donatus auctus&quot; ==
During the Renaissance, Donatus&#x27; &quot;Vita Vergili&quot; is often collected in anthologies of ancient literature. The humanists had interpolated other materials into the &quot;Vita Vergili&quot; to add details and fill in gaps, and these interpolations are collectively called &quot;Donatus auctus&quot; [&quot;the augmented Donatus&quot;]. &quot;Donatus auctus&quot; was added some time around 1426–37, between the first and second redactions of the &quot;De scriptoribus illustribus latinae linguae&quot; [&quot;On Famous Writers of the Latin Language&quot;] of Sicco Polenton, and it became the standard account of Virgil&#x27;s life up until the 18th century.

The text and translation is found in Ziolkowski and Putnam (2008: II.A.37, 345–69), with italics for the &quot;Donatus auctus&quot; and non-italics for &quot;Vita Vergili&quot;.

See for an evolutionary tree for all the versions of &quot;Vita Vergili&quot;.

This &quot;Vita&quot; depicted Vergil as a wise scholar and expert in science, while disregarding the anecdotes portraying Vergil as a magician, which were added during the medieval period in other &quot;Vita&quot;.

&quot;Donatus auctus&quot; contains one oft-quoted poem &quot;sic vos non vobis&quot;, which was recorded in Codex Salmasianus. See section 251, 252 in I.1 of &quot;Latin Anthology&quot; (B. G. Teubner, 1982). The version recorded in Codex Salmasianus contained just two lines; it was expanded into 5 lines in &quot;Donatus auctus&quot;.

<text>Luxoflux Corp. was an American video game developer founded by Peter Morawiec and Adrian Stephens in January 1997, and based in Santa Monica, California.

==History==
&quot;Luxoflux&quot; had a relatively small-sized development team for its first few titles. The two founders were joined by Jeremy Engelman, David Goodrich and Edvard Toth, and released their first title &quot;Vigilante 8&quot; to great success. The game was ported to the Nintendo 64, and was followed by the sequel &quot;Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense&quot; in 1999.

<doc id="723683" wikidata="Q3915832" url="?curid=723683" title="Glyn Ford">
<text>Glyn Ford (born 28 January 1950) is a British academic and Labour Party politician. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1984 to 2009, initially for Greater Manchester East until 1999, then South West England from 1999 to 2009.

==Early life and education==
Ford was born in Gloucester. He went to Marling School, Stroud. After a year as an apprentice at the British Aircraft Corporation he returned to education gaining a degree in Geology from the University of Reading in 1972, then a master&#x27;s degree in marine Earth science from University College London in 1974.

==Academic career==
For most of his academic career Ford worked at the University of Manchester, as a research fellow (1976–1979), a lecturer (1979–1980), and finally as a senior research fellow in the Department of Science and Technology Policy (1980–1984).

He also taught for the Open University (1976–1978) and UMIST (1977–1978). He was a research fellow at the University of Sussex (1978–1979). In 1983, he spent six months as a visiting professor at Tokyo University.

After becoming a member of the European Parliament in 1984, the University of Manchester made him an honorary visiting research fellow.

==Political career==
While working at the university, he was a local councillor in the Greater Manchester borough of Tameside, where he was the Chair of the Environmental Health and Education Committees.

On 14 June 1984 Ford was elected as a member of the European Parliament for the new constituency of Greater Manchester East. He held this seat for three terms, until the constituency was abolished in 1999, being re-elected on 15 June 1989 and 9 June 1994.

In 1987 he stood as the Labour candidate for the Hazel Grove constituency in Greater Manchester in the 1987 general election, a seat where Labour had no likelihood of winning.

From 1989 to 1993 Ford was Leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party and Deputy Chair of the European Parliament Socialist Group. Consequently he was also a member of Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee.

On 10 June 1999 Ford was elected as a member of the European Parliament for the constituency of South West England for both the Labour Party and the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party. Gibraltar was part of the South West England European Parliament constituency. Ford campaigned for Gibraltar to have its own seat in the European Parliament, rather than only having representation through the South West England constituency.

Ford held this seat for two terms, being re-elected on 10 June 2004. He lost his seat in the elections on 4 June 2009. The Labour Party gained 118,716 votes (7.61%) in the South West region in 2009, which was insufficient to win a seat in the multi-member constituency which had had its representation reduced from seven to six at that election.

Ford&#x27;s three main areas of interest are Research and Development, Racism and East Asia. Ford was for fifteen years a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s Research Committee, the Guest Editor of the Science and Public Policy Special Issue on Science and Technology in Europe and the author, with Chris Niblett and Lindsay Walker, of &quot;The Future for Ocean Technology&quot; (Frances Pinter, 1987).

Ford was Chair of the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee of Inquiry into The Growth of Racism and Fascism in Europe (1984–86) and &quot;rapporteur&quot; for a second European Parliament Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia. He served as the European Parliament&#x27;s representative on the Council of Ministers Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (1994–99). He was National Treasurer of the Anti-Nazi League and author of Fascist Europe (Pluto, 1992). 

In 1996 he published with Glenys Kinnock and Arlene McCarthy &quot;Changing States: A Labour Agenda for Europe&quot; (Mandarin, 1996). 

He served throughout his time in the European Parliament as a member of the Japan Delegation and as a member of the Korean Peninsula Delegation from its formation in 2004. In these roles he visited North Korea almost 50 times. He was the EU&#x27;s Chief Election Observer in Indonesia in 2004 and in Aceh 2006–7. In 2008, he published, &quot;North Korea on the Brink: Struggle for Survival&quot; (Pluto) which has been subsequently been published in Japanese and Korean. He wrote for The Japan Times.

After leaving the European Parliament, Ford founded the Public Affairs and International Relations consultancy Polint.

Ford stood in the 2014 European Parliament election, but his second position on the Labour South West England list did not yield a seat.
Ford is a member of the Labour Party National Policy Forum, and was re-elected in 2015.

Since 2014 Ford has been Director of the Brussels-based NGO Track2Asia.
In 2014, he was a regular contributor to Tribune. As of 2020, Ford writes on international matters for &quot;Chartist&quot;, &quot;NK News&quot; and &quot;38 North&quot;.

<text>The Canada men&#x27;s national soccer team () represents Canada in international soccer competitions since 1924. They are overseen by the Canadian Soccer Association, the governing body for soccer in Canada. They have been a member of FIFA since 1948 and of CONCACAF since 1961.

Canada participated in its second FIFA World Cup in 2022 after finishing first in CONCACAF qualifying, and competed in its first Copa América in 2024, finishing fourth. Previously, their top achievements were winning the 1985 CONCACAF Championship to qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup and winning the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup to qualify for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. Canada is the only national team aside from regional powerhouses Mexico and the United States to win a Gold Cup. Canada also won a gold medal in the 1904 Summer Olympics.

Canada will co-host the 2026 World Cup along with the United States and Mexico.

==History==
===Early years===
Soccer was being played in Canada with the Dominion Football Association (1877) and Western Football Association (1880) acting as precursors to the modern-day Canadian Soccer Association. In 1885, the WFA sent a team to New Jersey to take on a side put forth by the American Football Association, the then-unofficial governing body of the sport in the United States. On November 28, 1885, in an unofficial friendly, Canada defeated the United States 1–0 at Clark Field in the East Newark neighborhood of Kearny, New Jersey. The American team won 3–2 in a return match one year later. In 1888, a team represented the WFA in a tour of the British Isles, earning a record of nine wins, five draws, and nine losses. The squad comprised 16 Canadian-born players with the only exception being tour organizer David Forsyth, who had immigrated to Canada one year after his birth.
In 1904 Galt F.C. represented the WFA at the Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri. As just one of three teams competing, Galt defeated two American clubs, Christian Brothers College (7–0) and St. Rose (4–0) to win the tournament. The &quot;Toronto Mail and Empire&quot; of November 18, 1904, reports that &quot;Immediately after the game, the Galt aggregation, numbering about 50 persons, retired to the office of James W. Sullivan, chief of the Department of Physical Culture, where they received their prize. After a short talk by Mr. James E. Conlon of the Physical Culture Department, Mayor Mundy, of the City of Galt, presented each player on the winning team with a beautiful gold medal.&quot; The medals are clearly engraved with the name of the company in St. Louis that made them.

In 1905, a British team of touring amateurs nicknamed the &quot;Pilgrims&quot; toured Canada, with their match against Galt billed as the &quot;championship of the world&quot;. The match was played in front of 3500 fans in Galt, now part of Cambridge, Ontario, and ended in a 3–3 draw. Earlier the Pilgrims had been beaten 2–1 by Berlin Rangers, in the city now known as Kitchener.
The Canadian national team toured Australia in 1924, playing a series of &quot;test&quot; friendlies against their hosts, including their first official match, a 3–2 friendly defeat to the Australian national team in Brisbane, Queensland on June 7, 1924. Canada also played Australia at the Jubilee Oval, Adelaide on Saturday July 12, 1924, and defeated them by 4 goals to 1. In 1925, Canada played their old rivals, the United States, in Montreal, winning 1–0 on Ed McLaine&#x27;s goal. In a return match in November 1925 in Brooklyn, New York, Canada was defeated 1–6. One year later, Canada lost 2–6 to the Americans in the same city before playing four internationals in a 1927 tour of New Zealand.

The New Zealand tour included a total of 22 games, of which Canada won 19 with only 2 defeats. Most of the games were against local combined teams although Canada also played New Zealand in four occasions (scores: 2–2, 2–1, 0–1, 4–1).

===1928 to 1987===
Following the lead of British soccer associations, Canada withdrew from FIFA in 1928 over a dispute regarding broken time payments to amateur players. They rejoined the confederation in 1946 and took part in World Cup qualifying in the North American Football Confederation (NAFC) (a precursor to CONCACAF) for the first time in 1957, the first time they had played as a national team in 30 years. Under the guidance of head coach Don Petrie, Canada defeated the United States in Toronto 5–1 in their opening game, but lost two games in Mexico (failing to play a home game due to financial reasons) 0–2 and 0–3 before defeating the U.S. 3–2 in St. Louis. Mexico advanced as group winners, meaning that Canada missed out on the World Cup in Sweden.

Canada withdrew from World Cup qualifying for 1962 and did not enter a team for 1966. They did compete in soccer however at the 1967 Pan American Games, their first time to do so in the sixth edition of the games, which they hosted in Winnipeg. Canada finished fourth place, helped somewhat by defending champion Brazil&#x27;s absence.

A 0–0 draw away to Bermuda meant the Canadians, under coach Peter Dinsdale, could not advance out of the first round of qualifying for the 1970 World Cup. Dinsdale was replaced by Frank Pike. In their second participation in soccer at the Pan Am games, held in Cali, Canada finished second in their opening round group (to hosts Colombia). In the final group round however, they managed only one win (over Colombia) and finished next to last.

Canada again failed at the first hurdle in qualifying for the 1974 FIFA World Cup. Under German head coach Eckhard Krautzun, they finished second in a home and away qualifying group for the 1973 CONCACAF Championship (to Mexico). For the 1975 Pan Am Games, Canada, along with most of the larger Pan Am countries, sent their Olympic team, which was amateur (and senior aged), to compete. After narrowly qualifying out of the first round, the Canucks were soundly defeated by Costa Rica, Cuba, and Mexico, conceding a total of 14 goals while scoring none. At the Summer Olympics at home the following year, under head coach Colin Morris, the amateur Canadian side failed to get out of the first round, losing both of their games. This despite the brilliant play of Jimmy Douglas, who scored a goal against a Dynamo Kyiv-dominated Soviet Union side and another goal against North Korea, Canada&#x27;s only two goals in the tournament.

In their North American qualifying group for the 1977 CONCACAF Championship, with both group winners and runners-up now advancing, Canada, again under head coach Krautzun, qualified as runners-up after defeating the Americans 3–0 in a neutral site one-match play-off, played in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In the championship, played in Monterrey and Mexico City, Mexico won all five of their matches with a +15 goal difference to win the tournament handily. Canada finished fourth.

Matters were different however at the next CONCACAF championship, in 1981, played in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. Canada entered the tournament raising eyebrows by winning their qualifying group over Mexico and the United States, even achieving a 1–1 draw against Mexico at the Azteca Stadium with Gerry Gray scoring from a direct free kick in the 88th-minute. In the final round, the Canadians opened strongly with a 1–0 win over El Salvador, with Mike Stojanovic the goal-scorer, and a 1–1 draw with Haiti, with Stojanovic scoring again. They next lost to the hosts Honduras 1–2 and then drew Mexico 1–1 with Ian Bridge scoring the equalizer via a corner kick. A win in their final game against Cuba would have put them through to Spain, but they were held to a 2–2 draw, allowing El Salvador to qualify as tournament runners-up.

Between 1981 and 1985, Canada continued to develop under the guidance of English coach Tony Waiters. After a strong performance at the 1984 Summer Olympics, Waiters would see the Maple Leafs through to their first World Cup finals appearance in 1985. A 1–1 away draw to Guatemala was key in allowing them to eliminate &quot;Los Chapines&quot; in the first round group. The second round was also closely contested, in part as this Canadian squad was strong defensively but had limited ability to score goals. The Canucks managed to eke out a 1–0 away win over Honduras, thanks to a George Pakos winner, hold Costa Rica scoreless in San José, and then in their final game, one they needed to draw to qualify, beat &quot;Los Catrachos&quot; a second time, 2–1 in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, with Pakos and Igor Vrablic the goal scorers. The victory not only secured their first World Cup finals berth, but also the crown of CONCACAF champions for the first time, although Mexico did not compete, having already qualified automatically for the World Cup as hosts.

At the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Canada impressed defensively in their first game against France, only conceding a late Jean-Pierre Papin goal after Papin had missed several earlier chances.
However, Canada could not build on their stubborn performance against France, losing their next two matches to both Hungary and the Soviet Union 0–2, finishing the group stage in last place with zero points.

Four Canadian players (Chris Chueden, Hector Marinaro, David Norman and Vrablic) were involved in a match fixing betting scandal at the Merlion Cup tournament in Singapore two months after the World Cup. The four players were suspended by the Canadian Soccer Association for &quot;bringing the game into disrepute&quot;. Norman was reinstated in 1992 after admitting his involvement in the scandal. Vrablic never played for Canada again.

===1990s===
Qualification for the 1990 World Cup lasted all of two matches for Canada, a home-and-away series with Guatemala, played in October 1988. The Central Americans won the first game 1–0 in Guatemala City while Canada prevailed in Vancouver 3–2. Tied on goal difference, &quot;Los Chapines&quot; advanced on the away goals rule.

1990 saw Canada take part in the first North American Nations Cup, hosting the three-team tournament. Mexico and Canada sent their full squads, but the United States sent a &#x27;B&#x27; team. Canada won the tournament after a 1–0 win over the United States on May 6 and a 2–1 win over Mexico on May 13. All three Canadian goals were scored by John Catliff, the tournament&#x27;s top scorer.

Canada came close to qualifying for the World Cup again in 1994 under the guidance of a defender on the 1986 team, Bob Lenarduzzi. They entered the tournament at the second round stage and advanced as group runners-up. Canada competed strongly in the final qualifying round, drawing their first match in Tegucigalpa after a controversial penalty allowed the Hondurans to draw even, winning their next two, over El Salvador and Honduras in Vancouver, losing convincingly at Azteca Stadium, and winning 2–1 in San Salvador. They went into their final group match against Mexico, in Toronto, needing a win to win the group and thus qualify directly for the World Cup. Canada went up 1–0 on a goal credited to Alex Bunbury off a free kick, but Mexico scored twice to win, 2–1. The loss meant Canada finished second and advanced to an intercontinental play-off series where they needed to win two rounds to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The Reds went up against Oceania Football Confederation&#x27;s champions Australia. Canada won the first leg 2–1 in Edmonton. Australia led the second leg 2–1 at the end of 90 minutes, sending the tie to extra time. There was no score in the extra 30 minutes, meaning the series was decided by a penalty shootout which Australia won 4–1 to eliminate Canada from contention. Australia went on to lose 2–1 on aggregate to Argentina, who advanced to the World Cup.

With the World Cup to be played in the United States, Canada had the opportunity to play a number of high-profile squads in tune-up matches. The highlight of this set of matches—played against Morocco, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands all within 13 days—was Canada holding eventual World Cup champions Brazil to a 1–1 draw at Commonwealth Stadium, on a 69th-minute equalizer by Eddy Berdusco, on Canada&#x27;s only real scoring chance in the game.

With three countries set to qualify out of CONCACAF for the 1998 World Cup, and with Canada handily winning their second round group over El Salvador, Panama, and Cuba, expectations were high for a second qualification in 12 years in the spring of 1997. The aging Canadians, however, fared miserably, losing their opening game to Mexico 0–4 and the following match to the U.S. 0–3. In their next two matches, against El Salvador and Jamaica, they could only manage two 0–0 draws in Vancouver. A 1–0 win over Costa Rica in Edmonton in their next match thanks to a goal by Berdusco gave Canada some hope at the halfway point but losses to both Jamaica and El Salvador away ended any aspirations as they finished bottom of the group with 6 points from 10 games and a −15 goal difference. Having overseen two consecutive World Cup campaigns ending in the side failing to qualify, Lenarduzzi stepped down in 1997 and was replaced by interim head coach Bruce Twamley.

===2000s===
The Canadian Soccer Association turned to another German to lead the senior national team in 1998 with the signing of Holger Osieck. Success came quickly with Canada winning the CONCACAF Gold Cup in February 2000. After emerging from the first round on a coin-toss tiebreaker with invited side Republic of Korea, the Canucks scored a quarter-final upset win over Mexico. The win set the stage for an unprecedented run to the final, where Canada defeated Colombia 2–0 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Canada swept the awards ceremony, with goalkeeper Craig Forrest winning MVP honours, Carlo Corazzin securing the Golden Boot, and Richard Hastings named Rookie of the Tournament.

Expectations were again high following the winter&#x27;s result, but the campaign sputtered. A positive 1–0 away result in Havana in June was followed by a listless 0–0 home draw against Cuba. For the semi-final round two out of four teams advanced. Canada was eliminated from World Cup contention after finishing third in the semi-final round. Canada managed just one goal in 6 games while conceding 8 to finish third in the standings, well adrift of advancing sides Trinidad and Tobago and Mexico.

Winning the Gold Cup earned Canada a place in the 2001 Confederations Cup, where the highlight was holding Brazil to a 0–0 draw. The Gold Cup victory also won them an invitation to compete in the 2001 Copa América. When security concerns prompted the cancellation of the tournament, Canada disbanded their training camp. The tournament was then reinstated and held on schedule. The Canadian Soccer Association announced they would not be able to participate in the reinstated tournament.

Canada had another strong showing in the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup, losing to the United States in the semi-finals in penalties, and then defeating South Korea in the third-place game, 2–1. The Gold Cup was held the following year, and Canada was eliminated in the first round on goal difference, leading to head coach Osieck resigning in September 2003 and former player Colin Miller put in charge as an interim.

2004 marked the beginning of 2006 World Cup qualification and a new era under the guidance of former Canadian skipper Frank Yallop. Things began brightly, with the Canadians dispatching of Belize handily in the preliminary round, 8–0 on aggregate, in a home-and-home series. Matters turned, however, with Canada finishing bottom in a group featuring Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras. They got only 5 points from 6 matches and a −4 goal difference. Hard times continued under Yallop as the Canucks again went out at the first barrier in the Gold Cup, losing to both the U.S. and Costa Rica, while defeating Cuba. The coach stayed on through 2005 into the following summer, overseeing a series a friendlies against European sides. He resigned on June 7, 2006, finishing with a win-loss record of 8–9–3.

Things turned around under interim coach Stephen Hart&#x27;s guidance. Canada opened their 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup campaign with a 2–1 win over Costa Rica. A 1–2 upset loss to upstarts Guadeloupe was followed by a 2–0 victory over Haiti, securing Canada first-place in their group. They next beat Guatemala 3–0 in their quarter-final match setting up a semi-final showdown with the host Americans. Substitute Iain Hume scored for Canada in the 76th minute to cut the United States&#x27; lead to 2–1. After the United States were reduced to ten men, Canada pressed for the equalizer but were denied when Atiba Hutchinson&#x27;s stoppage-time goal was incorrectly flagged offside by linesman Ricardo Louisville and Canada was eliminated.

The team faced criticism for its poor handling of goalkeeper Greg Sutton, who suffered a concussion during a practice prior to the start of the Gold Cup. Without a doctor accompanying the team, Sutton instead saw a local physician who cleared him to practice, resulting in Sutton suffering post-concussion syndrome. Sutton was lost to his professional club Toronto FC for nearly a year.

Prior to the Gold Cup on May 18, 2007, the Canadian Soccer Association announced that former national team player Dale Mitchell would take over as head coach of the senior team after the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Mitchell had previously served as an assistant coach under Coach Frank Yallop. Under Mitchell, Canada drew friendlies with Iceland and against Costa Rica, lost 0–2 to South Africa, had a 1–0 win over Martinique, and a 0–2 defeat to Estonia. Optimism grew, however, as Canada played well in a 2–3 loss to Brazil.

Despite defeating Saint Vincent and the Grenadines 7–1 on aggregate in a second-round series—they had had a bye in the first—Canada did not play at the level they had at the Gold Cup and were eliminated from qualifying for the 2010 World Cup. They conceded an equalizer shortly after scoring the opening goal in a 1–1 draw to Jamaica at BMO Field, conceded two second-half goals in quick succession in a 1–2 home loss to Honduras at Saputo Stadium, and then lost away to Mexico and Honduras. They finished last in the four-team group with just 2 points from 6 matches. On March 27, 2009, head coach Dale Mitchell was fired. The president of the Canadian Soccer Association, Dominic Maestracci, said that &quot;the Canadian Soccer Association is committed to the future of our men&#x27;s national team program. We have made this decision to move the program in a new direction.&quot; Technical director Stephen Hart was renamed as interim head coach. On December 9, 2009, Hart was named as head coach.

===2010s===

Stephen Hart&#x27;s first competitive action as the full-time head coach was a poor showing at the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, not managing to get out of the group stage. However, during the early stages qualifying for the 2014 World Cup, Canada topped their group in the second round but were eliminated in the third round of CONCACAF qualifying, finishing one point behind Honduras and Panama after losing 8–1 in Honduras on the final match day.
After a series of interim coaching changes following Stephen Hart&#x27;s dismissal on October 12, 2012 Benito Floro replaced Colin Miller as Canada&#x27;s coach on August 1, 2013. Being a coach with top-flight management experience in La Liga, he was expected to help Canada raise its competitiveness prior to 2018 World Cup qualifying. In the midst of Floro&#x27;s player identification and restructuring phase, the team experienced many difficulties including a 958-minute goal-scoring drought, which was finally broken by Atiba Hutchinson in a 1–1 draw with Bulgaria on May 23, 2014. Despite showing improvement with two draws in Europe, Canada continued to shed FIFA points having gone winless for nearly two years, and sank to their lowest ever FIFA ranking of 122 in August 2014. Canada ended a 16-match winless streak on September 10, 2014, defeating Jamaica 3–1 in Toronto.

Canada was drawn into the 2018 FIFA World Cup second round of qualifying against Dominica in June 2015. Canada entered the second round of 2018 World Cup qualifying against Dominica with a game at Windsor Park in Dominica which they won 2–0 with goals from Cyle Larin and a penalty converted by Russell Teibert. In the return leg at BMO Field in front of 9,749 fans they defeated Dominica 4–0 with two goals from Tosaint Ricketts and one each from Tesho Akindele and Cyle Larin.

The team did not score a single goal and finished last in their group in the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup after two 0–0 draws to El Salvador and Costa Rica, while also suffering a 1–0 loss against Jamaica. Canada then advanced to the third round of 2018 World Cup qualifying against Belize, winning 4–1 on aggregate and advancing to the fourth round of 2018 World Cup qualifying. Canada was drawn into a group against Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico. They played their first pair of matches in the fourth round on November 13 and 17, 2015. The first match was played in Vancouver at BC Place against Honduras, resulting in a 1–0 win for Canada thanks to a deflected goal by Cyle Larin. The crowd of 20,108 set a new record for the Canadian men&#x27;s team in the province of British Columbia. In their next game on November 17, away at El Salvador, Canada drew with El Salvador 0-0 as Julian De Guzman broke Canada&#x27;s record for most caps for the national team with his 85th cap, passing Paul Stalteri&#x27;s record of 84 caps. With this result in Canada&#x27;s last game of 2015, they ended off the year conceding just three goals in their final 12 games and in 14 games overall, they ended off with a record of 6 wins, 6 draws, and 2 losses.

On March 25, 2016, in a World Cup qualifier against Mexico at BC Place, 54,798 people were recorded in the stadium which set a new attendance record for a Canadian national team of any sport. Ultimately, however, Canada lost the game 3–0, but remained in second place in the group, keeping them in contention for World Cup qualification. On September 6, 2016, after failing to qualify for the fifth round of 2018 World Cup qualifying despite a 3–1 win over El Salvador, head coach Benito Floro was sacked on September 14, ending his reign as coach of the national team.

Canada announced Octavio Zambrano as the new coach of the national team on May 16, 2017, replacing Michael Findlay who was the interim coach after Floro&#x27;s departure. He guided Canada to a quarterfinal finish at the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, with the team getting out of the group stage for the first time since 2009. However, on January 8, 2018, Zambrano was let go and was replaced with John Herdman, who previously was the head coach of the Canadian women&#x27;s national team.

Under Herdman, Canada qualified for the top division in the inaugural season of the CONCACAF Nations League following an undefeated qualifying campaign. Competing in CONCACAF Nations League A, Canada earned a 2–0 victory over the United States at BMO Field, Canada&#x27;s first win against their American rivals since 1985. However, Canada would fall to a 4–1 defeat against the United States in the away leg and failed to qualify for the Nations League Finals.

=== 2020s ===
Canada&#x27;s national team was marked by the arrival of a golden generation of new young players, led by the first Canadian UEFA Champions League winner Alphonso Davies of Bayern Munich, the most expensive Canadian soccer player in history, Jonathan David who joined Lille for a €30-million fee in 2020 and the establishment of the Canadian Premier League, the first fully professional soccer league in the country. In the first round of World Cup qualifying, Canada finished with a 4–0–0 record to win Group B and progress to the second round. The second round was two leg home-and-away tie against Haiti which Canada won 4–0 on aggregate with a 1–0 win in the away leg and a 3–0 win in the home leg, the latter being played at SeatGeek Stadium in Chicago due to COVID-19 restrictions in Canada. The victory over Haiti led to Canada qualifying for the third and final round of World Cup qualifying for the first time since 1997.

==== 2022 FIFA World Cup berth ====
Canada began the third round of World Cup qualifying unbeaten in its first eleven matches, finishing 2021 with its first win over Mexico in over 20 years to finish the year at the top of the table. It also ended the year 40th in the FIFA World Rankings, its highest-ever position to date, earning the team the honour of &quot;Most Improved Side&quot; after having started the year ranked 72nd.

On March 27, 2022, Canada defeated Jamaica 4–0 on Matchday 13 to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. This ended a 36-year drought since the first and only time Canada played in the FIFA World Cup, in 1986. The speed of the team&#x27;s ascent was such that it was subsequently revealed that neither the federation nor kit supplier Nike had anticipated them qualifying, and as a result they would be the only team in Qatar to not receive a special kit for the occasion. Defender Sam Adekugbe remarked &quot;I think that just shows that no one really believed in us. I don&#x27;t think Canada believed.&quot;


In Canada&#x27;s first match of the tournament against Belgium on November 23, Davies failed to score an early penalty in an eventual 1–0 loss, despite Canada dictating most of the play, and failing to convert any of their 22 shots. Four days later, Davies scored Canada&#x27;s first ever goal at the World Cup, in a game against Croatia. Croatia came back to win 4–1, eliminating Canada from the tournament after two matches. Canada were defeated 2–1 by Morocco in their final group match on December 1, finishing in last place in their group with zero points. Post-event assessments of Canada&#x27;s performance were mixed, with many saying that opportunities had been missed, while also creating possibilities for the future 2026 FIFA World Cup that Canada would co-host.

==== Road to 2026 World Cup ====

Canada automatically qualified for the 2026 World Cup as co-host in February 2023. They also qualified to the 2023 CONCACAF Nations League Finals by winning Group C. A 2–0 victory over Panama on June 15, 2023, saw the national team reach its first final in 23 years, where they lost to the United States 2–0. Following this, many of the team&#x27;s established players opted not to attend the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup held later that same summer. After some difficulties in the group stage, Canada reached the quarter-final of the tournament, losing to the United States in a penalty shootout. The summer championships marked the end of Herdman&#x27;s tenure with Canada Soccer, with his departure coming at the end of August to manage Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, amidst media discussion of conflicts with the federation over funding and playing opportunities.

Interim coach Mauro Biello was tasked with guiding the team through the quarter-finals of the 2023–24 CONCACAF Nations League A in November 2023, where victory in a two-legged aggregate match or away goals rule against Jamaica would both send them to the following spring&#x27;s semi-finals and qualify them to participate in CONMEBOL&#x27;s 2024 Copa América. After defeating Jamaica 2–1 in the away leg, Canada needed only a draw in the home match at BMO Field to advance. Leading halfway through, the team collapsed to lose 3–2 in the second half and 3–2 on away goals, as a result missing both the Nations League semi-final and immediate qualification to the Copa América. The loss to Jamaica prompted considerable criticism of the team, Biello, and the federation, with &quot;The Athletic&quot; opining that Canada&#x27;s &quot;humiliating loss&quot; should be considered its worst defeat since falling 8–1 to Honduras in World Cup qualification in 2012. As a result, the qualifying play-off for a final place in the Copa América was scheduled on March 23, 2024, against Trinidad and Tobago, which they later won 2–0.

In May 2024, Canada Soccer hired Jesse Marsch to serve as Herdman&#x27;s permanent replacement as coach. Due to ongoing financial difficulties, the money to pay Marsch was found via donations from MLS clubs CF Montreal, Toronto FC, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC and other private parties. This drew media attention due to the unusual arrangement of the naming rights to the coaching position being given as part of the arrangement, called the &quot;MLS Canada Men&#x27;s National Team Head Coach&quot;. In advance of the Copa América, Marsch&#x27;s first matches with the team were two friendlies against high-profile opponents, first a lopsided 4–0 loss to the Netherlands, and then a goalless draw with second-ranked France that was generally considered a major success. Canada began Group A play at the Copa against world No. 1-ranked Argentina, a 2–0 loss that nevertheless was generally considered a credible showing. They defeated Peru 1–0, with David scoring the team&#x27;s first goal of the Marsch era to earn the country&#x27;s first victory over a CONMEBOL team since the 2000 Gold Cup final. A draw with Chile saw Canada finish second in the group and advance to the knockout stage, where they defeated Venezuela 4–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in regulation time to reach a semi-final rematch with Argentina. After another 2–0 loss to the Argentines, Canada played Uruguay in the third-place match. They led 2–1 for the final ten minutes of regulation, but allowed a tying goal in stoppage time, and lost 4–3 on penalties to finish fourth.

On September 7, 2024, Canada defeated the United States 2–1 in a friendly match in Kansas City, Kansas, marking their first victory against the Americans on American soil since 1957. Following two victories over Suriname in the November 2024 international window, the team rose to 31st in the FIFA rankings, a new high.

==Rivalries==
===United States===
Canada has a rivalry with the United States, stemming from a generally friendly rivalry between the two countries. The two teams frequently face each other in the Gold Cup. With 42 matches played, the United States currently leads the series with 19 wins, 12 draws, and 11 losses, outscoring the Canadians 66–47.

Canada has qualified for two FIFA World Cups while the U.S. has qualified for 11. Until recently, Canada was not seen as a competitive rival by a number of American fans as it had not beaten the United States in a 34-year stretch. That streak was snapped on October 15, 2019, when Canada defeated the United States 2–0 at BMO Field. One month later, on November 15, the United States beat Canada 4–1 in Orlando, Florida, and defeated the same opponent 1–0 in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup in Kansas City, Kansas. In 2022 World Cup qualifying, Canada earned a 1–1 draw in Nashville, Tennessee and defeated the United States 2–0 in Hamilton, Ontario. 

On June 18, 2023, the United States defeated Canada 2–0 in the 2022–23 CONCACAF Nations League final in Las Vegas, Nevada, marking the first time the two nations faced each other in the final of a major CONCACAF tournament. Three weeks later, the U.S. eliminated Canada 3–2 on penalties in the 2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup quarter-final.

==Stadiums==

BMO Field is Canada&#x27;s largest natural turf stadium, followed by Saputo Stadium, in Montreal. Canada played their 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers at BC Place in Vancouver. During 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Canada used BMO Field in Toronto, Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, and Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton. Due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, Canada played their home games for the first and second rounds of 2022 World Cup qualifying in stadiums in the United States.

<doc id="723691" wikidata="Q1339991" url="?curid=723691" title="Peter Skinner">
<text>Peter William Skinner (born 1 June 1959 in Oxford) is a British former Labour Party politician. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1994 until 2014, first for the Kent West constituency from 1994 to 1999, and then from 1999 for South East England, after the reforms in European Elections created multi-member constituencies based on British regions. On 31 March 2016, Skinner was found guilty of fraudulently claiming expenses whilst an MEP, and subsequently jailed for 4 years.

==Early life==
Peter Skinner was born in Oxford on 1 June 1959. Educated at St. Josephs R.C. Secondary Modern School in Orpington, Kent, he attended Bradford University between 1979 and 1982 where he attained a BSc in Economics and Politics. Between 1986-7 he undertook a post-graduate course in Industrial Relations at the University of Warwick, and in 1991 completed a post-graduate Diploma in Education at Coventry University. Skinner has also gained a professional qualification in Management from the University of Greenwich.

==Professional career==
Skinner was a press consultant and latterly a lecturer in Economics and Business at North West Kent College of Technology and University of Greenwich before being elected to the European Parliament.

==Member of the European Parliament==
In 1994, Skinner was elected to the European Parliament as the Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Kent West, a political constituency within England. In 1999, he was elected again to the European Parliament, as an MEP for the South East of England Region. He was re-elected in 2004 and 2009, before standing down at the 2014 European Parliament election. He was succeeded by Anneliese Dodds.

==Expenses fraud and conviction==
In 2015, Skinner was charged with: two counts of making a false instrument; one count of fraud; and one count of false accounting between 2004 and 2009. In his subsequent trial at Southwark Crown Court, the jury heard that he had claimed almost £500,000 for support staff over a five-year period. In evidence, it was alleged that Skinner had made payments of £10,000 a month to his wife from December 2007 until July 2009, which entitled him to claim secretarial or parliamentary assistance allowance. It is also alleged that he created a fake letter, for a payment of £5000 for work conducted by his father. In his defence, Skinner claimed he had been confused over the rules, and blamed a lack of information given to him by the European Parliament. On 31 March 2016, Skinner was found guilty of: one count of making a false instrument; one count of fraud; and one count of false accounting. Warned that he would face a prison sentence, on 29 April 2016 he was jailed for 4 years.

<doc id="723708" wikidata="Q970264" url="?curid=723708" title="Neversoft">
<text>Neversoft Entertainment, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Woodland Hills, California. The studio was founded by Joel Jewett, Mick West and Chris Ward in July 1994 and was acquired by Activision in October 1999. Initially, the studio worked with Playmates Toys, where they worked on the game &quot;Skeleton Warriors&quot;, which was based on a animated television series of the same name. Throughout 1996, the studio grew, and worked on projects with Crystal Dynamics and Sony Computer Entertainment, but due to internal conflicts, they were cancelled.

After a meeting with Activision in 1998, the publisher agreed to enter into a deal with the studio to create &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, which used the game engine created by Neversoft for one of the cancelled Sony projects. During the game&#x27;s development, Activision asked the studio to work on a prototype for a skateboarding game, and after an impressed reaction from Activision to the prototype, the publisher released the game as &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; in 1999 to critical acclaim and acquired Neversoft at the end of that year. Neversoft developed a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; game for the PlayStation the following year, along with six &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; games over the next several years.

In 2004, the company split into two teams to work on two games at once, the upcoming &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; and a new intellectual property, the western action-adventure game &quot;Gun&quot;. After Activision&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; in 2006, Neversoft continued the franchise, working on &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, which was released in 2007 to similar acclaim to previous games in the franchise. With the game&#x27;s success, Neversoft focused on developing new &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; games, passing development of new &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; to Robomodo. The last game in the franchise by Neversoft was &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; in 2010, which received mixed reviews and sold poorly. Due to this, Activision reduced Neversoft to a support studio for future &quot;Call of Duty&quot; games.

Starting in 2011, the studio worked in collaboration with numerous Activision studios on &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;, who developed the Chaos Mode DLC, and &quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot;, who has developed the Extinction mode of the game. Following the release of the latter, Neversoft was merged with Infinity Ward on May 3, 2014, and was made defunct on July 10, 2014. The last game the studio worked on was &quot;Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare&quot;, developed with Sledgehammer Games and released later that year.

==History==
Neversoft was founded in July 1994 by three employees of Malibu Interactive (previously Acme Interactive), a division of Malibu Comics based in Westlake Village, California. At that time, the primary platforms were the home gaming consoles, the Genesis/Mega Drive and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Games for these systems could be developed by small teams, anywhere from two to ten developers. As a result, it was much easier than at present to set up a game development company, and several groups of people had already left Malibu to strike out on their own. Joel Jewett, a native of Montana and a CPA, was at the time head of development at the rapidly shrinking Malibu Interactive. He teamed up with Mick West, a game programmer, who had just completed working on &quot;&quot; for the Genesis, and Chris Ward, a video game artist.

In July 1994, Neversoft was formed. They initially found work for Playmates Interactive, a then-division of Playmates Toys who were about to release a line of toys called Skeleton Warriors and wanted a video game to go along with the toys and the cartoon series. Neversoft began work on the game design and moved into offices in Woodland Hills, California. Neversoft worked on the Genesis version for five months. Over that time they hired another artist and a level designer. In December 1994, Playmates cancelled the game. They were not unhappy with the progress, but had decided that they needed to develop the game for the Sega Saturn. 1995 was spent developing &quot;Skeleton Warriors&quot; for the Sega Saturn. Over the course of 1995, Neversoft grew rapidly by hiring three programmers, five artists, a level designer, a tester and an office administrator. &quot;Skeleton Warriors&quot; was finished in time for the 1995 holiday season and Neversoft began looking for other work while they ported &quot;Skeleton Warriors&quot; to the PlayStation in 1996.

Neversoft continued to expand during 1996, expanding to over twenty employees. They worked for six months on a game based on &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; for Crystal Dynamics, which was cancelled due to financial problems with the publisher. With some excess capacity Neversoft started to develop a game of their own design, initially called &quot;Big Guns&quot;. The technology developed there was used in their next project, a conversion of the PC game &quot;MDK&quot;. Towards the end of 1996, Neversoft sold the idea for &quot;Big Guns&quot; to Sony Computer Entertainment and they began development. 1997 was a tumultuous year for Neversoft. The &quot;MDK&quot; conversion took far longer than expected, and the &quot;Big Guns&quot; game (renamed &quot;Exodus&quot;) went through numerous design changes at the behest of Sony and was cancelled in November 1997. The company shrunk back to just twelve employees. Neversoft spent the next few months shopping around their technology, meeting with numerous companies and looking for work.

In January 1998, just as Neversoft was about to run out of money, they had a meeting with Activision, who were looking for someone to re-develop &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, a failed internal project. The technology developed for &quot;Big Guns&quot; turned out to be ideal for the project, Activision was impressed and Neversoft began work on &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. In May 1998, &quot;Apocalypse&quot; was going very well, and Activision signed up Neversoft to develop a prototype for a skateboarding game. This proceeded slowly as they could not spare many people from &quot;Apocalypse&quot;. The initial prototypes resembled the arcade game &quot;Top Skater&quot;. &quot;Apocalypse&quot; wrapped up in October 1998 and development began in earnest on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. By the end of 1998, the game development was in full swing and Neversoft comprised 16 people: six programmers, five artists, three level designers, one producer and Joel, the company&#x27;s president.

From 1999 to 2007, Neversoft developed nine &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; games and increased their employees to over 150.

In 2005, Neversoft developed a Western action-adventure open world game entitled &quot;Gun&quot;, alongside Beenox and Rebellion Developments.

In 2006, Activision acquired the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series from Harmonix Music Systems, as well as RedOctane, and chose Neversoft as the developer. Neversoft developed several games in the franchise, breaking several records with &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;. The games following &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot; would be developed by Vicarious Visions, developers of the Wii ports and &quot;Guitar Hero: Van Halen&quot;. In light of this, 50 employees were laid off on February 11, 2010. In May 2014 it was reported that Neversoft had been merged with &quot;Call of Duty&quot; creators Infinity Ward to create what was internally referred to as a &quot;super-studio&quot;.

Neversoft was officially made defunct on July 10, 2014, 20 years to the day of its founding, with the remaining employees attending a burning of a sculpture of the skewered eyeball from their logo that has been part of their offices before.

==Release history==
&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; (&quot;THPS&quot;) was released on the PlayStation in August 1999. Development of a sequel began immediately after its release. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was also developed for Activision in 2000. Like &quot;THPS&quot;, the technology for this game was based on the &quot;Apocalypse&quot; engine, which was in turn based on the &quot;Big Guns&quot; engine. Neversoft was now developing two major games in parallel, and expanded into two large teams. Activision acquired Neversoft in the summer of 1999 in a stock swap deal. The founders of Neversoft and several key employees signed four-year employment agreements.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; were both released in 2000. Neversoft began work on &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; specifically for the PlayStation 2. After both teams finished their projects they were merged into one large team. &quot;THPS3&quot; was developed using the RenderWare game engine. &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; was released in 2001, followed by &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; in 2002. In 2003 Neversoft reworked the game with a more story-oriented approach in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, followed by a sequel in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot; in 2004. In 2005 Neversoft again split into two teams to begin work on the internally developed &quot;Gun&quot; and the seventh version of the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series — &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s American Wasteland&quot;.

&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot; was developed and released in 2006. This was the first title under Neversoft that was developed as a next-gen title for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground&quot; was released in 2007. It is the second title for the PlayStation 3 and third for Xbox 360 in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; series. It was the last &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; game to be developed by Neversoft; the franchise moved to Robomodo.

After Activision acquired RedOctane and the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series, Harmonix developed their last &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; game, &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s&quot;, before they were acquired by MTV. Neversoft became the developer for the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series beginning with &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, using their in-house game engine made from scratch instead of Harmonix&#x27;s engine. Several &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series games have been developed by Neversoft since 2007, including &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot; (incorporating drums and vocals alongside guitar), &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot;, &quot;Band Hero&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;.

<text>Alpha Sigma Phi (), commonly known as Alpha Sig, is an intercollegiate men&#x27;s social fraternity with 181 active chapters and provisional chapters. Founded at Yale in 1845, it is the 10th oldest Greek letter fraternity in the United States.

The fraternity practices many traditions. Its Latin motto is &quot;Causa Latet Vis Est Notissima&quot; (&quot;The cause is hidden, the results well-known&quot;). The fraternity&#x27;s official symbol is the phoenix, as the phoenix rises from the ashes of its old body, signifying the re-founding of the fraternity in the early 1900s. Due to active expansion efforts, Alpha Sigma Phi continues to offer services and opportunities to over 8,000 undergraduate students and well over 72,000 living members.

==History==

===Founding===
Alpha Sigma Phi was founded by three men at Yale College in 1845 as a secret sophomore society composed of many of the school&#x27;s poets, athletes, and scholars. Upon rising through the ranks of the school, members shared membership with Alpha Sigma Phi in their sophomore year, one of three fraternities in their junior year and Skull and Bones or Scroll and Key in their senior year.
The founders of Alpha Sigma Phi were:
*Louis Manigault – member of a French family that became prosperous through the operation of a South Carolina plantation
*Stephen Ormsby Rhea – the son of John Rhea, a cotton planter of Louisiana who helped make the disputed territory of West Florida part of the U.S. through his involvement in the French and Indian War
*Horace Spangler Weiser – a descendant of Conrad Weiser, a refugee from Europe known for his participation in the French and Indian War and treaty negotiations with Native Americans

Manigault and Rhea met at St. Paul&#x27;s Preparatory School near Flushing, New York, where both were members of the same literary society and were preparing themselves for admission to Yale. Weiser attended a private school in New Haven, and he met Rhea early in his freshman year, who introduced him to Manigault.

Once at Yale, Manigault and Rhea became members of Yale&#x27;s Calliopean Literary Society, and Weiser was a member of the Linonian Literary Society. Manigault was very much interested in the class society system at Yale and noted the class fraternities provided experience for their members and prepared them for competition in literary contests. The sophomore class there had only one society, Kappa Sigma Theta, which displayed an attitude of superiority toward non-fraternity men.

Manigault revealed to his friends Rhea and Weiser a plan for founding another sophomore society. Rhea agreed and enlisted Weiser to become the three founders of Alpha Sigma Phi. Their first official meeting was held in Manigault&#x27;s room on Chapel Street on December 6, 1845. The constitution and ritual were then written and the fraternity pin was designed. The first pledge class, of 14 members, was initiated on June 24, 1846.

After the birth of Alpha Sigma Phi, an intense rivalry began with Kappa Sigma Theta. This was expressed in their publications, Kappa Sigma Theta&#x27;s &quot;The Yale Banger&quot; and Alpha Sigma Phi&#x27;s &quot;The Yale Tomahawk&quot;. In 1852, the editors of the &quot;Tomahawk&quot; were expelled after violating faculty orders to cease publication. However, the rivalry between the organizations continued until 1858, when Kappa Sigma Theta was suppressed by the faculty.

===Beyond Yale===
The first expansion effort was to Amherst College, Massachusetts, in 1847, but it only lasted about six months, at which time due to faculty opposition at Amherst, the parent chapter requested that it dissolve and return the constitution. However, a fragmentary document in the Yale library suggests that Beta was chartered in 1850 at Harvard University but lived a very short life due to a wave of puritanism. The chapter at Harvard was revived in 1911 as Beta chapter but only survived about 20 years; the charter was withdrawn due to Harvard&#x27;s anti-fraternity environment. When the Amherst College chapter was restored in 1854, it was designated as either Gamma or Delta chapter. (a charter document found in Yale archives shows the latter, but &quot;Baird&#x27;s Manual&quot; from its earliest editions and later records of the fraternity refer to it as Gamma.) When the chapter at Marietta College was chartered in 1860, it was given the Delta designation, despite the parent chapter being aware of this discrepancy.

When the Civil War broke out across the United States, almost every member of Delta at Marietta enlisted in the Union Army. Three of the brothers gave their lives fighting for the Union cause. Former chapter presidents William B. Whittlesey and George B. Turner fell on the battlefields of Chattanooga and Lookout Mountain. They willed their personal possessions and their swords to the chapter, which treasured those mementos until the chapter closed for two decades in the mid-1990s.

From 1858 through 1863 the sophomore members of Alpha Sigma Phi were elected in almost equal numbers by the two stronger Junior Class fraternities, with a smaller number going to the third. In 1864, however, the mother chapter at Yale was torn by internal dissension. Because less attention was being given to the sophomore class societies, some Alpha Sigma Phi members pledged to Delta Kappa Epsilon, a junior class society, and attempted to turn the control of Alpha Sigma Phi over to Delta Kappa Epsilon. However, the attempt was thwarted by members of Alpha Sigma Phi who had pledged to the other two junior class societies. A conflict ensued, and the faculty suppressed Alpha Sigma Phi to end the disorder. However, the traditions of Alpha Sigma Phi were carried on by two new sophomore class societies, Delta Beta Xi and Phi Theta Psi. Louis Manigault sought to renew his loyalty and friendship with his brothers of Alpha Sigma Phi, and agreed with Rhea and Weiser to consider Delta Beta Xi its true descendant. They were unaware at the time that Delta chapter at Marietta still existed as Alpha Sigma Phi.

The second founders were:

Wayne Montgomery Musgrave, an honors graduate of New York University, Yale and Harvard. He provided the organizational spark that fanned Alpha Sigma Phi into national prominence.

Edwin Morey Waterbury, born in Geneseo, New York, on September 26, 1884, son of Dr. Reuben A. and Frances Waterbury. Dr. Waterbury was an educator, and vice-principal of the New York State Normal School at Geneseo from 1873 to 1895.

With the inactivation of Delta Beta Xi at Yale, Alpha Sigma Phi was kept alive only at Marietta by Delta. At Yale, in fall 1906 four friends agreed in a conversation over a card game that an organization was needed that was open to all students, instead of representing only the sophomore or junior classes. The four friends were Robert L. Ervin, Benjamin F. Crenshaw, Arthur S. Ely, and Edwin M. Waterbury.

Other members soon joined the group in their mission, the first of which were Fredrick H. Waldron and Wayne M. Musgrave. Ervin knew some of the alumni brothers of Delta at Marietta and asked them to send the first letter to Delta. On March 27, 1907, Ely, Crenshaw, Musgrave, Waldron, and Waterbury traveled to Marietta and were initiated into Alpha Sigma Phi. Upon returning to New Haven, they initiated the other friends they had recruited into the new Alpha chapter at Yale.

Many of the old Alpha members returned to Yale upon hearing the news of the refounding, and helped acquire the fraternity&#x27;s first piece of real estate, the &quot;Tomb&quot;, a windowless two-story building. No non-member was allowed entrance. No member could speak of the interior of the building, and were even expected to remain silent while passing by the exterior of the building.

===Expansion===
A new national organization was formed at an Alpha Sigma Phi conference at Marietta in 1907, and within a year there were three new chapters: Zeta at Ohio State, Eta at the University of Illinois, and Theta at the University of Michigan. In 1909, Iota chapter was established at Cornell University, and Kappa chapter was founded at the University of Wisconsin. In 1910, another convention was held with the members of the former chapters at Yale, Amherst and Ohio Wesleyan University, and a delegation from the Yale Delta Beta Xi fraternity. All of these pledged to anew their loyalty to a restored Alpha Sigma Phi, and soon afterward the chapters Mu at the University of Washington, Nu at University of California, Berkeley, and Upsilon at the Pennsylvania State University were added.

Alpha Sigma Phi survived World War I fairly easily and even recruited many new members during those years. In the post-war era, Alpha Sigma Phi expanded at the rate of one chapter per year. In 1939, Phi Pi Phi merged with Alpha Sigma Phi, as the Great Depression left that fraternity with only five of its original twenty-one chapters. World War II hit Alpha Sigma Phi hard, with many brothers losing their lives due to the conflict, forcing many chapters to close.

On September 6, 1946, Alpha Kappa Pi merged with Alpha Sigma Phi. Alpha Kappa Pi had never had a national office, but was still a strong fraternity. During the war, they had lost many chapters and realized the need for a more stable national organization. Alpha Sigma Phi expanded again in 1965 by five more chapters when it merged with Alpha Gamma Upsilon. The 1980s found a younger generation of leaders taking the reins of the fraternity. Keeping in mind one of its oldest traditions, being a fraternity run by undergraduates, the leadership and undergraduates began expanding in new directions.

In 2006, Alpha Sigma Phi won the North American Interfraternity Conference&#x27;s Laurel Wreath Award for the Ralph F. Burns Leadership Institute for new members. In 2016, the fraternity won the Laurel Wreath Award for their educational program &quot;Toastmasters&#x27; Lite&quot;. The program provides undergraduate brothers the opportunity to learn and practice public speaking skills.

==Awards==
Grand Senior Presidents Cup 
First presented at the 1960 Grand Chapter, this award recognizes chapters of the Fraternity - one for a chapter at an institution with a large undergraduate population (20,001+ undergraduates), one for a chapter at an institution with a medium undergraduate population (8,501-20,000 undergraduates) and one for a chapter with a small undergraduate population (fewer than 8,500 undergraduates) - that have best exemplified the ideals and purpose of the Fraternity. Chapters who score the highest in all areas of the Annual Report are recognized with the Grand Senior President&#x27;s Cup. This is the highest honor a chapter can receive within Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity. The Chapter must be in good standing with Fraternity Headquarters and excel in all aspects of the Fraternity&#x27;s Annual Report for Accreditation. 

Most Improved Chapter Award
The most improved chapter award is given to the chapter that has demonstrated significant improvement from one award period to the next award period. 

Victor B. Scott Award
The Victor B. Scott Award is awarded annually to the chapter whose academic grade point average most greatly exceeds its college or University&#x27;s all men&#x27;s average. Brother Victor Scott presented the scholarship plaque for the purpose of ‘creating an incentive on the part of each chapter of the Fraternity to strive for higher average in scholarship on the campus on which the chapter was located. After the merger with Alpha Sigma Phi, an award was named in his honor for outstanding chapter scholarship. In 2018, Grand Historian Emeritus, Robert Kutz, UC-Berkeley &#x27;67, established an endowment to allow for this award to once again be bestowed. 

==Notable members==
==Local chapter or member misconduct==
In 2017, the chapter at the University of Arizona was kicked off campus for blindfolding pledges and making them consume alcohol. One fraternity member was arrested for assault for pushing a pledge into a pillar at the fraternity house.

In 2018, Jacob Stephens, the fraternity&#x27;s treasurer at the University of Oklahoma was convicted of stealing $32,000 from the chapter. He was charged with embezzlement.

In 2019, the chapter at the University of Wisconsin were suspended and after suspension placed on probation for hazing and public humiliation. Pledges were forced to run errands for initiated members, wear Dora the Explorer backpacks, and carry fruit on campus.

==Co-ed pressure, expulsion==
In 1983, &quot;Tau chapter&quot; at Stanford University split off from the national fraternity organization over controversy regarding that chapter&#x27;s inclusion of women as initiated members. The chapter had begun the tradition of initiating women some years earlier, but when a female member became president of the chapter, the national fraternity organization reacted with an immediate suspension and threat of charter revocation. &quot;Tau chapter&quot; became Alpha Sigma Co-Ed Fraternity thereafter, surviving independently for over ten years.

<doc id="723712" wikidata="Q91398" url="?curid=723712" title="Sandbag">
<text>A sandbag or dirtbag is a bag or sack made of hessian (burlap), polypropylene or other sturdy materials that is filled with sand or soil and used for such purposes as flood control, military fortification in trenches and bunkers, shielding glass windows in war zones, ballast, counterweight, and in other applications requiring mobile fortification, such as adding improvised additional protection to armored vehicles or tanks.

The advantages are that the bags and sand are inexpensive. When empty, the bags are compact and lightweight for easy storage and transportation. They can be brought to a site empty and filled with local sand or soil. Disadvantages are that filling bags is labor-intensive. Without proper training, sandbag walls can be constructed improperly causing them to fail at a lower height than expected, when used in flood-control purposes. They can degrade prematurely in the sun and elements once deployed. They can also become contaminated by sewage in flood waters making them difficult to deal with after flood waters recede. In a military context, improvised up-armouring of tanks or armored personnel carriers with sandbags is not effective against cannons (though it may offer protection against some small arms).

Sandbags have traditionally been filled manually using shovels. Since the 1990s, machine filling has become more common, allowing the work to be done more quickly and efficiently.

==Usage==
===Flood control===
Properly stacked sandbags are an effective deterrent against damaging flood waters. Sandbags can be used to build levees, barricades, dikes and berms to limit erosion from flooding. Sandbags can also be used to fortify existing flood control structures and limit the effects of sand boils. Sandbag structures do not prevent water seepage and therefore should be built with the central purpose of diverting flood water around or away from buildings.

Properly filled sandbags for flood control are filled one-half to two-thirds full with clean washed sand. In an emergency, if clean sand is in limited supply, gravel or dirt can also be used with less effective end results. When filled sandbags are stacked or laid in place, the contents need to settle flat to the ground. Sandbags filled over two-thirds full will not form an adequate seal to the ground or structure. Likewise sandbags filled under one-half will generally also form an inadequate seal to the ground when placed.

The best practices for filling sandbags require a three-person team. One team member will crouch down and hold open the bag to form a collar opening. The second team member places the tip of a pointed shovel with sand into the opened sandbag. A square shovel is not recommended as the blade of the shovel will not fit into the sandbag when filling. The third team member will transport and stockpile the filled sandbags.

Properly placed sandbags will be set lengthwise and parallel to the water flow with the folded or open end of the sandbag facing upstream. All loose debris should be removed from the placement surface and the lowest areas are the first spots to be filled in with sandbags. Each bag must be set consecutively with the tightly packed bottom slightly overlapping the previously placed sandbag. Subsequent layers of bags should be offset by 1/2 the length of a sandbag to eliminate voids and improve the wall seal. Each placed bag should be tamped and flattened to improve the seal.

The two primary methods for stacking sandbags to build flood control structures are the (1) Single Stack placement, and; (2) Pyramid Placement Method.

===Fortification===
The military uses sandbags for field fortifications and as a temporary measure to protect civilian structures. Because burlap and sand are inexpensive, large protective barriers can be erected cheaply. The friction created by moving soil or sand grains and tiny air gaps makes sandbags an efficient dissipator of explosive blast. The most common sizes for sandbags are to . These dimensions, and the weight of sand a bag this size can hold, allow for the construction of an interlocking wall like brickwork.

Individual filled bags are not too heavy to lift and move into place. They may be laid in excavated defences as revetment, or as free-standing walls above ground where excavations are impractical. As plain burlap sandbags deteriorate fairly quickly, sandbag structures meant to remain in place for a long time may be painted with a portland cement slurry to reduce the effects of rot and abrasion. Cotton ducking sandbags last considerably longer than burlap and are hence preferable for long-term use. However, the vast majority of sandbags used by modern military and for flood prevention are made of circular woven polypropylene. Some of the World War I memorial trenches were rebuilt with concrete sandbags after the First World War—although criticized as looking unnatural, they have lasted well. During World War II in Great Britain, some aircraft revetments and pillboxes were made from concrete filled sandbags, again these have lasted well.

Sandbag fortifications have been used since at least the late 16th century. For example, the rebellious Mughal governor Mirza Jani Beg used improvised sandbags made out of boat sails to construct a makeshift fort at Unarpur, Sindh, in 1592. Later, British loyalists used sandbag and log fortifications in the 1781 Siege of Ninety-Six during the American Revolutionary War. Nathanael Greene was familiar enough with the fortification technique to equip his troops with hooks to pull down the sandbag and log walls when they stormed the Star Redoubt in Ninety Six, South Carolina.

In ancient times, temporary sandbag forts known as an antestature were made out of sandbags. They were historically hastily established by a retreating force to slow the progress of the enemy. The word comes from the Latin &quot;ante&quot; (&quot;before&quot;), and &quot;statūra&quot; (&quot;a standing&quot;).

==Bulk bags==

Bulk bags, also known as big bags, are much larger than traditional sandbags. Moving a bag of this size typically requires a forklift truck. Bulk bags are usually made of woven or non-woven geotextiles.

Large bags of sand are often used in flood control and making temporary patches to water barriers. For example, Thailand utilized bulk bags filled with sand to erect temporary walls to protect against the 2011 Thailand floods.

==Other uses==

Sandbags are also used for disposable ballast in gas balloons, and as counterweights for theatre sets. Some temporary construction signs or advertising signs are held in place and secured against being blown over with sandbags.

During World War II, sandbags were also used as extemporized &quot;soft armor&quot; on American tanks, with the goal of protecting the tanks from German anti-tank rounds, but they were largely ineffective.

Sandbags can also be carried within vehicles to provide improved traction during inclement weather (typically stored above the drive wheels where the increased weight improves traction). If ever stuck, sand can be removed and placed directly onto the slippery surface thereby providing greatly improved traction. Sandbags are also used by off-road enthusiasts instead of sand plates or sand ladders to assist the vehicle to get traction and momentum after being stuck in soft sand. The same sandbags can be used to bridge deep holes or ditches. Apart from being very light and taking very little space (when empty), the sandbags are a much cheaper option than any of the other options (sand plates, sand ladders, multipurpose bags, etc.).

Sandbags are often used to temporarily stabilize soil from erosion, such as oceanfront structures whose foundations have been undermined by heavy waves. Sandbags are also used in earthbag construction to make inexpensive, environmentally sustainable homes. In addition, sandbags are often used when shooting a long gun, specifically a rifle or sniper rifle, from a rest, as it provides support for the weapon, allowing for less movement during shooting.

Sandbags of various sizes and weights can be used for exercise or resistance training.

Sandbags are used for safety in film, video and theatrical production. Sandbags are often used as easily portable weight to lower the center of gravity of a Light stand or a C-Stand where heavy items are placed at the top of a high stand often having a small base. Shot bags are another type of flexible weight used for the same purpose.

<text>Diana Paulette Wallis, (born 28 June 1954 in Hitchin, Hertfordshire) is a British former Liberal Democrat Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Yorkshire and the Humber. Wallis was first elected in 1999 and re-elected in 2004 and in 2009. She resigned her seat in January 2012 and went on to pursue academic, legal and mediation-related activities.

On 6 September 2013, Wallis was elected President of the European Law Institute, an independent non-profit organisation established to initiate, conduct and facilitate research, make recommendations and provide practical guidance in the field of European legal development with a goal of enhancing the European legal integration. She was re-elected in 2015 for a second term, which lasted until 2017.

Wallis contested Haltemprice and Howden as a Yorkshire Party candidate in the 2015 and 2017 UK General Elections and subsequently left that party in March 2019.

She later joined Change UK and was selected as the lead candidate for Yorkshire and the Humber at the 2019 European Parliament elections.

==Early career==
Wallis read History at North London Polytechnic, graduating as a BA. She further studied at the University of Kent, where she obtained the degree of Master of Arts (MA), Liege, Zurich and Chester. Before being elected to the European Parliament she practised for over 15 years as a litigation lawyer (solicitor), mainly in London where she developed a European cross-border practice. Wallis was lecturer at the University of Hull in European business law from 1995 to 1999. Wallis was also a Councillor on Humberside County Council and deputy leader of the East Riding Unitary Council from 1994 to 1999.

==Member of the European Parliament==

Wallis was elected Member of the European Parliament on three successive occasions in 1999, 2004 and 2009 (5th, 6th and 7th legislative terms of the European Parliament). During her tenure she held a number of senior positions and authored a large number of parliamentary reports.

=== Vice-Presidency of the European Parliament ===
In 2007, Diana Wallis became the first British female of any political persuasion in twenty years to be elected to the post of Vice President of the European Parliament, as well as being the first British Liberal Democrat to do so. After the change into the sixth legislative term in 2009, the Parliament&#x27;s plenary re-elected her to the position for a second term.

As a member of Parliament&#x27;s Bureau, comprising the President, Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, her portfolio focused on transparency and access to documents (meaning under the Parliament&#x27;s internal rules that she signed off on appeals for access to the Parliament&#x27;s documents under Regulation 1049/2001), the Arctic and high north, Question Time (jointly with another Vice-President) and the Academy of European Law based in Trier (Germany). Her further duties as Vice-President included chairing the plenary sessions of the European Parliament and replacing the Parliament&#x27;s President in international fora (Arctic and high north) or at official events. Wallis notably led the call for an official day to commemorate the Srebrenica genocide of 1995 and attended the commemoration in Potocari, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on behalf of the European Parliament.

As Vice-President for transparency, she led the Parliament&#x27;s lengthy negotiations with the European Commission led in 2011 to the first Transparency Register for interest representatives seeking to influence decision-making of the EU institutions (commonly referred to as lobbyists), together with a Code of Conduct. The Transparency Register has grown to include a very large number of registered entities and individuals (over 10,000 in total) and is managed jointly by the European Parliament&#x27;s and the European Commission&#x27;s services. Furthermore, she opened up the directly-elected Parliament&#x27;s archives from the time of its first President (1979), Simone Veil, in her presence in Paris on 23 March 2008.

As Vice-President she took part in two key working groups whose aim it was to reform, on the one hand the functioning of the Parliament&#x27;s plenary, and on the other hand, the Parliament more generally.

=== Leadership of national delegation ===
As a Member of the ALDE European-level political group in the European Parliament, Wallis was leader of the Liberal Democrats in the European Parliament 2000–2004, and then from June 2006 to January 2007.

=== Committee on Legal Affairs / Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (previously merged) ===
During her membership of more than ten years in the JURI and IMCO committees, Wallis led work on behalf of her political group (&quot;coordinator&quot;), and was responsible as rapporteur for a number of pieces of legislation passing through the Parliament, including the &quot;Brussels I&quot; and &quot;Rome II&quot; Regulations which are two key pillars of the European Union&#x27;s private international law, the Regulation on Trade in Seal Products, the Regulation establishing the law applicable to maintenance obligations. She was also rapporteur on a number of non-legislative issues including the role of national judges in the EU&#x27;s legal system, e-commerce, e-publishing, collective redress, e-Justice, judicial training, mediation, consumer law, and European contract law.

=== Committee on Petitions and Inquiry into crisis at Equitable Life ===
Wallis was also a full member of the Petitions Committee where she regularly authored reports on the application of EU law across the Member States and the European Commission&#x27;s role in monitoring these common rules. As Rapporteur to the Committee of Inquiry into the Equitable Life affair, she is author of a report which was approved by a large majority in the Parliament and which made a number of recommendations prior to the economic and financial crisis of 2008, including the &quot;further strengthening of prudential supervisory and regulatory standards throughout the Union&quot;, in order to avoid such a situation recurring in the future.

Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, Wallis played a key role as co-rapporteur in the setting-up of the European Citizen&#x27;s Initiative, which allows a minimum of 1 million citizens from a significant number of Member States to request a legislative initiative from the European Commission.

=== Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland, Norway ===
Until 2007, she was chair of the delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee and remained a full member of that Committee during the remainder of her parliamentary career.

=== Further parliamentary work ===
Throughout her time as an MEP, Wallis has authored 28 full reports excluding purely technical ones, and 16 opinions, asked 40 written and oral questions of the Commission and Council (during Parliament&#x27;s 2004–2009 term). She successfully piloted two written declarations until their adoption by the Parliament – one in 2007 on the European Emergency Number 1-1-2 (which achieved 530 MEP signatures, which is the record so far), and one in 2008 on Emergency cooperation in recovering missing children.

=== Bid for presidency of European Parliament and resignation ===
On 30 November 2011 Wallis announced her intention to stand for the position of President of the European Parliament as an independent candidate on the basis of nomination by 40 MEPs from different political groups. Other candidates were Martin Schulz and Nirj Deva. Martin Schulz was elected on 17 January 2012, as anticipated, and pursuant to the agreement between certain political groups, with Wallis obtaining 141 votes.

On 19 January 2012, two days after failing to become the Parliament president, Wallis announced her resignation, which took effect from 31 January 2012. Wallis had been due to be succeeded by her husband Stewart Arnold who was also employed by her as a Parliamentary Assistant, who had been second on the list of Liberal Democrat candidates for the seat in the 2009 election, but he declined the appointment and eventually went on to found the Yorkshire Party with Richard Carter. Rebecca Taylor, who was third on the list, was appointed instead.

==Past and present non-parliamentary activities==

=== Democracy and gender equality ===
Wallis has a particular interest in issues of direct democracy and in 2001 she co-founded the Initiatives and Referendums Institute - Europe (IRI-Europe) whose aim it is to assist modern direct democracy across the globe. In March 2006, she hosted an IRI-Europe conference in Brussels to discuss different approaches across Europe towards the issue of direct democracy and in particular the campaign for introducing a citizens&#x27; initiative at the European level. She is a board member of the Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute Europe. This is a think tank which has a particular interest in all issues relating to direct democracy.

Before and after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, she played an active role in shaping and implementing the European Citizen&#x27;s Initiative.

Wallis has been a vocal proponent of increasing the share of women in decision-making roles. In the run-up to the appointment of the second Barroso Commission in 2009, she co-launched a campaign &quot;send2women&quot; with the aim of securing at least two women among the top positions in the EU institutions which were rotating that year, and the ambition to increase female representation in the EU institutions overall. In this framework she met Commission President Jose-Manuel Barroso in a bid to increase gender equality within the College of Commissioners.

<text>Michel Aco (fl. 1680–1702, also known as Michel Accault) was a French explorer who, along with René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Father Louis Hennepin, explored the Mississippi River in 1679. Aco became La Salle&#x27;s lieutenant because of his knowledge of Native American languages and his abilities as an explorer. When the party reached the Illinois River; Aco, Hennepin and another man were sent to explore the upper Mississippi. During their exploration, they became the first Europeans to see Carver&#x27;s Cave and Saint Anthony Falls. They were later captured by Sioux Indians and held until the influence of Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut won their release. He was brought to the mouth of the Wisconsin River and went on to explore the Wisconsin River, the Fox River down to Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Mackinac Island, Michigan, and finally, in 1681, to Montreal. After his exploring days were over, Aco settled in Illinois and became a trader. He married Aramepinchieue, the daughter of a Kaskaskia chief in 1693, and had two children with her.

<text>The Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian: &quot;Socijaldemokratska partija Bosne i Hercegovine&quot; (SDP BiH) / &quot;Социјалдемократска партија Босне и Херцеговине&quot;), also simply known as the Social Democratic Party (Socijaldemokratska partija (SDP) / Социјалдемократска партија) is a social-democratic political party in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is officially multi-ethnic, although it lost most of its former support among Croat and Serb voters in the decade following the 2000 parliamentary election, when it began to lean more towards Bosnian populism, and now gathers most of its support from Bosniaks.

==History==
===Origin===
The SDP BiH has its roots in the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, founded in 1909. The party was founded by workers to defend and represent their rights and interests, and consisted of members of all ethnic groups. On 20 April 1920, the Social Democratic Party became part of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The SDP BiH was reestablished on 27 December 1992. The party was enlarged by the inclusion of the Social Democrats of BiH party to the original SDP.

===Timeline===
In the first post-war election in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1996, the SDP BiH appeared in a coalition with five other parties within the Joint List. Candidates for the Bosniak and Croat members of the Presidency, Sead Avdić and Ivo Komšić, were not elected.

On 6 April 1997, Zlatko Lagumdžija was elected as the SDP BiH&#x27;s new president. In the 2000 parliamentary election, the SDP BiH won the most seats in the House of Representatives. On 22 February 2001, Božidar Matić was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers. 

In the 2006 general election, Željko Komšić was elected Croat member of the Presidency. He was re-elected in the 2010 general election.

On 7 December 2014, Nermin Nikšić was elected president of the party, succeeding Lagumdžija. On the eve of the 2020 municipal elections, the SDP BiH entered into a four-party liberal coalition alongside the parties People and Justice (NiP), Our Party (NS) and the Independent Bosnian-Herzegovinian List, colloquially known as the &quot;Four&quot;.

The coalition, also supported by the Union for a Better Future and the People&#x27;s European Union, announced Denis Bećirović&#x27;s candidacy in the Bosnian general election on 21 May 2022, running for Presidency member and representing the Bosniaks. In the general election, held on 2 October 2022, Bećirović was elected to the Presidency, having obtained 57.37% of the vote. Following the election, the SDP BiH reached an agreement on the formation of a new government supported by the coalition of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, the Croatian Democratic Union, NiP, NS and the Democratic People&#x27;s Alliance.

==Ideology==
The Social Democratic Party is a centre-left democratic party. The program vision corresponds to values and ideas of social democracy in Europe and the world. The SDP BiH is a civic party that is particularly interested in improving the social status of workers, rural population, students, youth, veterans, women, pensioners and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the diaspora.

<text>Richard Stuart Howitt (born 5 April 1961) is a British Labour Party politician, and a former Chief Executive Officer of the International Integrated Reporting Council. For five years prior to becoming CEO of the IIRC, he acted as a voluntary IIRC Ambassador, promoting Integrated Reporting within the policy and business communities. He took over from the previous CEO Paul Druckman. He was Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for 22 years between 1994 and 2016.

==Background==
Howitt was born in Reading, Berkshire. He was brought up in a single-parent family, in a council house, and went to a comprehensive school. He graduated with a BA degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in 1982 and has a Postgraduate Diploma in Management Studies from the University of Hertfordshire.

After leaving university, he worked for four years in the voluntary sector and eight years for a disability organisation.

==Political activity==
Howitt served as a councillor on Harlow District Council from 1983 to 1995, including three years as Leader of the council. Here he spearheaded some groundbreaking work assessing local government&#x27;s environmental impact. He was the Labour Party candidate in Billericay in the 1987 general election.

Howitt was elected as an MEP to the European Parliament, representing the Essex South constituency, and served for the East of England constituency from 1999 to 2016.

Howitt is a key architect of the EU&#x27;s non-financial information directive, one of the biggest transformations in corporate disclosure anywhere in the world. He was rapporteur on corporate reporting-related issues, including social responsibility, for many years. On this topic he has been described as a &quot;trailblazer&quot;.

As lead-MEP on corporate responsibility, Mr Howitt has represented the EU on many missions worldwide, travelling extensively in Asia, Africa and the Americas. He has represented European interests in numerous international initiatives, including the UN Business and Human Rights Forum and the OECD Forum on Responsible Business Conduct.

Howitt helped to negotiate a £22 million European Union fund to help finance food banks in the UK, but in 2013 the UK government refused to accept the funds. Howitt stated:
Howitt was a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s National Policy Forum between 1994 and 2016. He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party leadership election.

In September 2016, Howitt announced his resignation from the European Parliament to become chief executive of the International Integrated Reporting Council. The Labour candidate next on the party list from the 2014 European Elections, Alex Mayer, replaced him as MEP.

In May 2021, he was elected as a member of Cambridgeshire County Council. He is Chair of the Adults and Health Committee.

<doc id="723732" wikidata="Q7157391" url="?curid=723732" title="The Peace Maker (pamphlet)">
<text>The Peace Maker is a thirty-six page pamphlet written by Udney Hay Jacob and published in Nauvoo on October 29, 1842 which rejected the growing rights of women on Biblical grounds. Jacob claimed female power was growing, it was dangerous, and the way to curtail it was through polygamy and granting men the sole power of divorce.
The pamphlet was adapted from a longer Biblical treatise that Jacob had presented to President Martin Van Buren in 1840. 

The original two-chapter pamphlet &quot;The Peace Maker&quot; was published in Nauvoo, Illinois, with Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, listed as the printer. The pamphlet caused an uproar within Nauvoo, and was published the same month as an expose published by recently excommunicated John C. Bennett. On December 1st, Smith printed a denial of any connection to the work, and stated that it had been published without his knowledge. Historians continue to debate Smith&#x27;s involvement and the possibility that some aspects of the pamphlet may have represented Smith&#x27;s thought.

==Summary==
&quot;The Peace Maker&quot; deals in substantial part with Biblical marriage laws, primarily divorce. Jacob argues that just as property can not put away its owner, women should not be able to instigate divorce. Furthermore, the only legitimate reason for divorce should be the refusal of a wife to submit to and revere her husband&#x27;s authority. The pamphlet advocates for polygamy as a way to undermine any sexual power a wife may use over her husband.

The pamphlet ends with &quot;the question is not now to be debated whether these things are so; neither is it a question of much importance who wrote this book? But the question, the momentous question is: will you now restore the law of God on this important subject, and keep it?&quot;

==Authorship==
Jacob was not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints when &quot;The Peace Maker&quot; was published. However, Jacob and his family had lived among the Latter Day Saints in Chautauqua County, New York, in the early 1830s and in the Latter Day Saint region of Hancock County, Illinois throughout the period of settlement there. Additionally, Jacob was baptized into the church in 1843, the year after his pamphlet appeared.

==Reaction==
Smith denounced the pamphlet in the December 1, 1842, issue of &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, the official church newspaper, writing:
There was a book printed at my office, a short time since, written by Udney H. Jacob, on marriage, without my knowledge; and had I been apprised of it, I should not have printed it; not that I am opposed to any man enjoying his privileges; but I do not wish to have my name associated with the authors, in such an unmeaning rigmarole of nonsence , folly, and trash. JOSEPH SMITH.
However, other sources raise the possibility that this statement may have been misleading. In particular, John D. Lee&#x27;s 1877 &quot;Confessions&quot; states, speaking about the 1842–43 period:
During the winter Joseph, the Prophet, set a man by the name of Udney Hay Jacob to select from the Old Bible scriptures as pertained to polygamy, or celestial marriage, to write it in pamphlet form, and to advocate that doctrine. This he did as a feeler among the people, to pave the way for celestial marriage.
Laurel Thatcher Ulrich notes that while both Jacob and Smith used Biblical arguments to justify polygamy (which Smith secretly practiced at the time), the beliefs about divorce espoused in &quot;The Peace Maker&quot; do not match Joseph Smith&#x27;s teachings or practices on divorce.

John Taylor, who helped manage the press that published &quot;The Peace Maker&quot;, also dismissed the pamphlet and felt William Smith was responsible for continuing its dissemination. 

The text offers several defenses of polygamy that were later used extensively by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Latter Day Saint sect which later migrated to Utah and defended the practice, arguing that polygamy produces greater marital unity than monogamy. The pamphlet also argues vigorously that male authority over females should be absolute and is of divine origin. The text has been influential in the development of 20th- and 21st-century Latter Day Saint polygamous movements.

<text>Treyarch Corporation ( ; formerly Treyarch Invention LLC) is an American video game developer based in Los Angeles with Additional studio locations in Vancouver, Canada; and Austin, Texas. Founded in 1996 by Peter Akemann and Doğan Köslü, it was acquired by Activision in 2001. The studio is known for its work for the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series, which it develops alongside Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software.

==History==
Treyarch was founded in 1996 as Treyarch Inventions and was acquired by Activision in 2001. In 2005, Gray Matter Studios was merged into Treyarch.

As part of the 2007 Leipzig Games Convention, Activision announced that Treyarch would be one of three developers behind their first James Bond-based game, &quot;007: Quantum of Solace&quot;. The game was released on October 31, 2008, in Europe and November 4, 2008, in North America. Vicarious Visions developed the Nintendo DS version and Eurocom developed the PlayStation 2 version. Treyarch is a major developer in the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series.

&quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot; held the record for the largest entertainment launch in history in any form of entertainment, breaking the record within 24 hours of its release until it was surpassed by &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. Sales from the game worldwide reached US$650 million within five days after its release. Treyarch worked on the Wii U version of &quot;Call of Duty: Ghosts&quot;, in order to optimize it for the console.

Dan Bunting, who had been co-lead of Treyarch since around 2003, was named in an investigative report by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; related to the lawsuit filed against Activision Blizzard by the state of California over workplace misconduct and discrimination. Bunting had reportedly mistreated an employee in 2017, but was kept on by Activision Blizzard&#x27;s CEO, Bobby Kotick. After &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; began their investigation, Bunting was let go.

On August 18, 2023, studio design director David Vonderhaar announced he would be leaving the studio after 18 years.

<text>Sira is a UK-based notified body, specialising in ATEX, IECEX and North American product approvals.

== Foundation ==
Sira began life as the British Scientific Instrument Research Association (BSIRA). It was founded in 1918 by a Committee of the Privy Council for the promotion of scientific and industrial research and supported by the DSIR. The first members of the association were representatives of the optical industry, but these were joined in the same year by the electrical scientific instrument, electromedical, and X-ray industries. Its first director of research was Sir Herbert Jackson (1863–1936).

BSIRA&#x27;s London headquarters were destroyed in the Second World War and, in 1947, the association moved to a site in South Hill, Chislehurst, a Grade II Listed former private house called &#x27;Sitka&#x27; By the 1960s, the association had become better-known as &#x27;Sira&#x27;. It evolved into a group of British engineering companies, based in south London, that designed test equipment and provided calibration services.

== Fate ==
In 2006, Sira Test and Certification Ltd, Sira Defence and Security, and Sira Environmental were owned by Volveré plc. In July 2009, Volvere sold Sira Test and Certification Ltd, Sira Certification Service and Sira Environmental Ltd to CSA International.

<doc id="723742" wikidata="Q756779" url="?curid=723742" title="2004 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season was a very deadly, destructive, and active Atlantic hurricane season, with over 3,200 deaths and more than $61 billion (2004 USD, $95.77 billion 2022 USD) in damage. More than half of the 16 tropical cyclones brushed or struck the United States. Due to the development of a Modoki El Niño – a rare type of El Niño in which unfavorable conditions are produced over the Eastern Pacific instead of the Atlantic basin due to warmer sea surface temperatures farther west along the equatorial Pacific – activity was above average. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30, though the season&#x27;s last storm, Otto, dissipated on December 3, extending the season beyond its traditional boundaries. The first storm, Alex, developed offshore of the Southeastern United States on July 31, one of the latest dates on record to see the formation of the first system in an Atlantic hurricane season. It brushed the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic, causing one death and $7.5 million (2004 USD) in damage. Several storms caused only minor damage, including tropical storms Bonnie, Earl, Hermine, and Matthew. In addition, hurricanes Danielle, Karl, and Lisa, Tropical Depression Ten, Subtropical Storm Nicole and Tropical Storm Otto had no effect on land while tropical cyclones. The season was the first to exceed 200 units in accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) since 1995, mostly from Hurricane Ivan, which produced the highest ACE out of any storm this season. Ivan generated the second-highest ACE in the Atlantic, only behind the 1899 San Ciriaco Hurricane.

There are four notable storms: Hurricane Charley, that made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS), causing $16 billion in damage in the United States alone. Later in August, Hurricane Frances struck the Bahamas and Florida, causing at least 49 deaths and $10.1 billion in damage. The costliest and most intense storm was Hurricane Ivan. It was a Category 5 hurricane that devastated multiple countries adjacent to the Caribbean, before entering the Gulf of Mexico and causing catastrophic damage on the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially in the states of Alabama and Florida. Throughout the countries it passed through, Ivan caused 129 fatalities and over $26.1 billion in damage. The deadliest storm was Hurricane Jeanne, which caused torrential rainfall in the mountainous areas of Haiti, resulting in mudslides and severe flooding that caused at least 3,000 fatalities. Jeanne also struck Florida, inflicting extensive destruction. Overall, the storm caused at least $7.94 billion in damage and 3,042 deaths, ranking it as one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in history.

Collectively, the storms of this season caused at least 3,261 deaths and about $61.15 billion in damage, making it the costliest Atlantic hurricane season at the time, until surpassed by the following year. As of 2024, it ranks as the seventh costliest Atlantic hurricane season to date. With six hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 intensity, 2004 also had the most major hurricanes since 1996. However, that record would also be surpassed by 2005 and 2020, with seven major hurricanes in those years. In the spring of 2005, four names were retired: Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This tied the then-record most names retired with 1955 and 1995, a mark also surpassed in 2005, when five were retired.

== Seasonal forecasts ==

Since 1984, forecasts of hurricane activity have been issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength and 2.7 become major hurricanes.

CSU released its first prediction on December 5, 2003, which projected an above average season, with 13 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. This forecast was adjusted upward slightly on April 2. On May 17, prior to the start of the season, NOAA forecasters predicted a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with twelve to fifteen tropical storms, six to eight of those becoming hurricanes, and two to four those hurricanes reaching major intensity. Dr. Gray released a prediction on May 28 that was similar, with 14 named storms, eight reaching hurricane strength, and three becoming major hurricanes.

After the season began, Dr. Gray announced he had revised his predictions slightly downwards on August 6, citing mild El Niño conditions. His new forecast was thirteen named storms, seven hurricanes, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. On August 10, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, but the same number of storms forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September 3, indicating sixteen tropical storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. The season ended up with sixteen tropical depressions, fifteen named storms, nine hurricanes, and six major hurricanes, which matched CSU&#x27;s final prediction on October 1.

==Seasonal summary==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2004. However, the first system, Hurricane Alex, did not develop until July 31. It was an above average season in which 16 tropical cyclones formed. All but one tropical depression attained tropical storm status, and nine of these became hurricanes. Six hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. Due to a Modoki El Niño – a rare type of El Niño in which unfavorable conditions are produced over the eastern Pacific instead of the Atlantic basin due to warmer sea surface temperatures farther west along the equatorial Pacific – activity was above average. Five hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 3,270 deaths and about $60.9 billion in damage. Additionally, Hurricane Alex and Tropical Storm Earl also caused losses and fatalities, though neither made landfall. The season officially ended on November 30, 2004.

Tropical cyclogenesis began at the end of July, with the development of Hurricane Alex on July 31. However, it did not become a named storm until the following day, which was the fifth-latest start since the 1952 season. August was an unusually active month, with eight named storms, including Alex, Bonnie, Charley, Danielle, Earl, Frances, Gaston, and Hermine. This broke the record for the most named storms in the month of August set in 1933 and 1995. This new record was tied in 2012. On average, there are only three tropical storms and one to two hurricanes in August. Of the eight systems that month, five became hurricanes and three strengthened further into major hurricanes. A total of five tropical cyclones developed in September, including the most intense system of the season, Hurricane Ivan. Activity decreased further in October, with the formation of only two systems, Tropical Storm Matthew and Subtropical Storm Nicole. The season then went dormant for over a month and a half, until Tropical Storm Otto developed on November 29. Otto was the final tropical cyclone of the season and degenerated into a remnant low pressure on December 3.
Reflecting the season&#x27;s high activity, the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index for the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season was 227 units, one of the highest values on record in the basin. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is tropical storm strength.

The 2004 season was very deadly, with about 3,270 fatalities overall. Nearly all of the deaths were reported in Haiti following the floods and mudslides caused by Tropical Storm Jeanne. The other tropical cyclones that caused fatalities include Hurricane Alex, Charley, Frances, Gaston, and Ivan, and Tropical Storms Bonnie and Earl. Because four out of the six major hurricanes made several landfalls, the season was also extremely damaging, with losses estimated at $60.9 billion, over half of which was caused by Hurricanes Charley and Ivan. A few other tropical cyclones caused light to moderate damage, including Hurricanes Alex and Gaston and Tropical Storms Bonnie and Matthew. In addition to the 16 tropical cyclones of the season, a tropical low in May brought torrential flooding to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, killing 2,000 people and causing extensive damage. Although the system was not officially classified as a tropical storm, it did have a circulation with loosely organized convection, resembling a subtropical cyclone.
===Records===
The 2004 season had numerous unusual occurrences and set many records. However, most of them were surpassed by the following year. With six hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 intensity, 2004 also had the most major hurricanes since 1996, a record which would be surpassed in 2005. Florida was directly impacted by four major hurricanes during the season – Hurricane Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. This was the first time four tropical cyclones produced hurricane-force winds in one state during a single season since four hurricanes made landfall in Texas in 1886. There were many other hurricanes in the season that were individually unusual. Hurricane Alex was the strongest hurricane on record to intensify north of 38°N latitude. Hurricane Ivan was the most unusual storm of the season. Ivan became the southernmost Category 4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin, as well as the first major hurricane in the Atlantic on record to form as low as 10°N latitude. A wave, possibly the largest ever recorded, was attributed to Ivan; this wave may have been as high as . Additionally, hurricanes Charley and Ivan ranked as the third and second costliest hurricanes in the United States at the time, respectively, behind only Hurricane Andrew. With $60.9 billion in damage, this was the costliest season at the time, until the following year.
==Systems==
===Hurricane Alex===
The interaction between a trough and tropical wave resulted in the development of a tropical depression on July 31, while centered about east of Jacksonville, Florida. After initially being poorly organized, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Alex late on August 1. The storm tracked northeastward and became a hurricane on August 3. As Alex moved out to sea, it intensified into a Category 3 hurricane and peaked with winds of . Alex reached major hurricane status second farthest north in the Atlantic, after Hurricane Ellen in 1973. Eventually, Alex weakened due to cooler sea surface temperatures. The hurricane fell to tropical storm intensity around 12:00 UTC on August 6. Six hours later, it became extratropical while located about east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and was soon absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone.

Rough seas and a storm surge up to on the Outer Banks of North Carolina caused minor beach erosion and washed out portions of a highway in Cape Fear. A man drowned near Nags Head due to these conditions. Strong winds also pelted the area, with sustained winds reaching and gusts up to in Hatteras. As a result, 10,000 buildings and houses were left without electricity. The combination of strong winds and the storm surge damaged more than 100 buildings and houses. At Ocracoke, coastal flooding was considered the worst since Hurricane Gloria in 1985. Additionally, rainfall up to on the Outer Banks flooded nearly 500 cars. Damage in North Carolina reached about $7.5 million. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, three people were injured by rip currents, while five others were hospitalized in New Jersey.
===Tropical Storm Bonnie===

A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Two on August 3, while located about east of Barbados. The depression crossed the Lesser Antilles on August 4, before degenerating back into a tropical wave. The remnants traversed the Caribbean Sea, and re-developed into Tropical Depression Two on August 8. The depression strengthened further upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie on August 9. A break in a mid-level ridge re-curved Bonnie northward on August 10 and then northeastward on August 11. Later that day, the storm peaked with winds of , before wind shear began weakening it. At 14:00 UTC on August 12, Bonnie made landfall near Apalachicola, Florida with winds of . The storm rapidly weakened inland and degenerated as a remnant low offshore of New Jersey on August 14.

In the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought light winds and mostly localized flooding to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The regenerated system brought light rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula. In North Florida, scattered power outages were reported, and rainfall and storm surge flooded roads, especially in Taylor County. A tornado in Jacksonville damaged several businesses and homes. Tornadoes were also reported in The Carolinas, and Virginia, with one in North Carolina destroying 17 homes and impacting 59 others. It also caused three deaths and $1.27 million in damage. In Greenville County, South Carolina, a few roads were washed out, while portions of U.S. Route 501 were inundated with of water. Minor flooding also occurred in Mid-Atlantic and New England. In Atlantic Canada, basement and road flooding was reported, especially in Edmundston, New Brunswick, New Brunswick. Slick roads caused one death in that area.
=== Hurricane Charley ===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 9 to the south-southeast of Barbados. Early on August 10, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Charley, before reaching hurricane intensity south of Jamaica on August 11. Charley continued to strengthen after curving northwestward and was a Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall near Alquízar, Cuba on August 13. After emerging into the Straits of Florida, Charley weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. However, the storm abruptly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane later on August 13, with winds peaking at . At 19:45 UTC on August 13, Charley made landfall at Cayo Costa, Florida, followed by another landfall in Punta Gorda about an hour later. Charley rapidly weakened over Florida, falling to Category 1 by early on August 14. Later that day, the storm emerged into the Atlantic, before making two more landfalls in Cape Romain and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina as a minimal hurricane. Late on August 14, Charley weakened to a tropical storm over southeastern North Carolina, shortly before becoming extratropical near Virginia Beach, Virginia.

The storm brought rainfall and strong winds to the island of Jamaica. In Westmoreland Parish, flooding inundated several homes and damaged roadways. Winds in the parish caused a large tree to fall on a house, resulting in significant damage to the home. In Kingston, high winds damaged power lines and homes. Widespread power outages occurred due to numerous downed trees and power lines. The storm left $4.1 million in damage and one fatality in Jamaica. Winds up to in Cuba left all of Pinar del Río Province and more than 50% of La Habana Province without electricity for several days. At least 70,290 homes and about 3,000 agricultural buildings were either damaged or destroyed. Roughly 95% of sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were ruined. There were four deaths and $923 million in damage. Impact in Florida was extreme: strong winds caused 2 million power outages and destroyed more than 2,439 structures and impacted over 26,749 others. Charley caused 24 deaths and 792 injuries. Agricultural losses were heavy, especially to oranges. Damage to agriculture totaled about $2.2 billion. In South Carolina, 2,231 houses were damaged, with 2,317 of those severely damaged and 40 were destroyed. Approximately 141,000 people were left without electricity. Port Charlotte was left without electricity for 13 days. Winds up to in North Carolina downed trees and power lines, and left 65,000 homes without power. Charley destroyed 40 houses and damaged 2,231 other homes in the state. Throughout the United States, the storm caused $16 billion in damage, with nearly of all of it in Florida. The remnants of Charley produced light rainfall in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
===Hurricane Danielle===

A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Four while south-southeast of Cape Verde on August 13. Although sea surface temperatures were only marginally warm, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle early on August 14. Further intensification occurred and by early on August 15, Danielle reached hurricane status. The storm deepened significantly over the next 24 hours and became a Category 2 hurricane. Later on August 16, Danielle peaked as strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of .

At the time of peak intensity on August 16, Danielle was heading northward to north-northwestward because of a subtropical ridge. Shortly thereafter, southwesterly vertical shear began increasing, causing the hurricane to weaken. Mid-level flow associated with a diffluent trough caused Danielle to move northeastward on August 18. Later that day Danielle deteriorated to a Category 1 hurricane, hours before being downgraded to a tropical storm. On August 19, Danielle became nearly stationary and moved erratically while southwest of the Azores. Eventually, the storm curved west-southwestward and weakened to a tropical depression on August 20. About 24 hours later, Danielle degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. The remnant low moved westward and then to the north-northwest, before dissipating about west-southwest of the westernmost islands of the Azores.
===Tropical Storm Earl===
By August 13, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Five while located about east of the Lesser Antilles. The depression headed westward between due to a strong subtropical ridge located to its north. After developing banding features and an increase in Dvorak intensity estimates, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl at 18:00 UTC on August 14. The storm strengthened slightly further and on the following day, it reached maximum sustained winds of . Later on August 15, Earl crossed the Windward Islands and passed just south of Grenada.

Although Earl appeared well-organized, it unexpectedly degenerated into a tropical wave on August 16, after a reconnaissance aircraft reported no closed circulation. The remnants eventually reached the Pacific Ocean and developed into Hurricane Frank on August 23. Tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall in Grenada damaged at least 34 homes and a nursing home and toppled several trees and electrical poles. Damage on other islands was confined to a few impacted homes, moderate crop losses, and widespread power outages, especially in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Tobago. One fatality occurred and 19 people were listed as missing.
===Hurricane Frances===

Around 00:00 UTC on August 24, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six, while located about west-southwest of the southernmost islands of Cape Verde. Moving west-northwestward, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Frances later that day. Frances reached hurricane status late on August 25 while curving northwestward. By August 28, the storm reached an initial peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of . Late the following day, Frances weakened to a Category 3 hurricane during an eyewall replacement cycle. However, by August 31, the storm re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and attained its maximum sustained wind speed of . Although approaching the Bahamas, wind shear and increasing westerly winds aloft caused Frances to weaken to a Category 3 hurricane late on September 2.

At 19:30 UTC on September 2, the system made landfall on San Salvador Island with winds of . Early the next day, Frances struck Cat Island while somewhat weaker. The system decelerated and weakened slightly to a Category 2 hurricane before landfall in Eleuthera hours later. By September 4, Frances made another landfall on Grand Bahama with winds of . Moving slowly west-northwestward, the hurricane made landfall in Hutchinson Island, Florida at the same intensity, early on September 5. Rapidly weakening, Frances fell to Category 1 intensity around midday and deteriorated to a tropical storm about six hours later. On September 6, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near New Port Richey, before another landfall at the mouth of the Aucilla River with winds of . Early on September 7, Frances weakened to a tropical depression over Georgia. By late the next day, the system became extratropical, though the remnants persisted until dissipation over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on September 11.

In the Bahamas, about 75% of residents lost electricity. Between 13 and 17 percent of the non-native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning from salt spray was noted. Several feet of water flooded the international airport at Freeport. Insured losses reached about $300 million. Severe damage was also dealt to banana, corn, and pineapple crops. About 4,160 homes received minor damage, while 2,522 houses were rendered uninhabitable or destroyed. About 700 people were left homeless. Additionally, sea walls, schools, bridges, roads, and docks were damaged. Strong winds brought severe damage to Florida, especially counties along the east coast. Hundreds of homes, mobile homes, and businesses were destroyed in Indian River, Martin, and St. Lucie counties, and damage was inflicted on thousands of other structures there. In the tri-county area alone, damage totaled approximately $4.5 billion. Palm Beach County also suffered particularly severely, with 15,000 houses and 2,400 businesses damaged there. About 4.27 million customers were left without electricity in Florida. Frances and its remnants brought extensive flooding to other states, especially in Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The storm spawned 101 tornadoes in the United States, with 45 in South Carolina alone. Damage in the United States totaled approximately $9.8 billion, placing Frances among the costliest hurricanes in the country. Overall, the storm caused 49 deaths, two each in the Bahamas and Ohio, eight in Georgia, and thirty-seven in Florida.
===Hurricane Gaston===
A frontal low-pressure area developed into Tropical Depression Seven at 12:00 UTC on August 27, while located about east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The depression gradually strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston early on August 28. Initially, Gaston tracked slowly, moving southeastward and then westward, before a developing mid- to upper-level ridge re-curved the storm northwestward. Gaston strengthened and briefly became a hurricane at 120:00 UTC on August 29, although operationally it was thought to have peaked as a strong tropical storm. Two hours later, the storm made landfall near Awendaw, South Carolina with winds of . Gaston weakened rapidly inland and was only a tropical depression by early on August 30. Gaston re-strengthened into a tropical storm while located over eastern Virginia on August 31, just hours before emerging into the Atlantic. Gaston re-intensified slightly further, but became extratropical near Sable Island on September 1.

In South Carolina, an unofficial measurement indicated wind gusts up to in South Capers Island, which is near Parris Island. Strong winds destroyed eight homes, damaged more than 3,000 buildings, and left more than 150,000 people without power. Additionally, flash flooding further inland severely damaged or destroyed at least 20 homes in Berkeley County. In North Carolina, widespread street flooding occurred, including inundation of portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Several trees were downed by strong winds, especially in Chatham and Johnston counties. A tornado in Hoke County damaged several homes. Severe flooding occurred in east-central Virginia due to rainfall amounts up to . In Chesterfield, Dinwiddie, Hanover, Henrico, and Prince George counties, 350 homes and 230 businesses were damaged or destroyed, and many roads were closed due to high water. In Richmond, more than 120 roads were closed, including a portion of Interstate 95. There were nine fatalities. Throughout the United States, Gaston caused about $130 million in damage. The remnants produced light rainfall in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Sable Island.
===Tropical Storm Hermine===

The frontal zone that spawned Hurricane Gaston developed an area of convection south of Bermuda on August 25. After detaching from the front and developing a circulation, the system became a tropical depression at 18:00 UTC on August 27. It initially remained weak while the convection fluctuated, until intensifying into Tropical Storm Hermine at 12:00 UTC on August 29. Later that day, wind shear exposed the circulation to the north of the convection, though the storm was able to a peak as a tropical storm on August 30. The storm turned northward under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge. Increased wind shear from Gaston weakened Hermine. By late on August 30, the circulation was entirely exposed from the convection.

Early on August 31, Hermine made landfall near New Bedford, Massachusetts as a minimal tropical storm. It rapidly weakened while moving northward, and after becoming extratropical, Hermine was absorbed by a frontal zone later that day. The storm brought tropical storm force winds and light rainfall to eastern Massachusetts, reaching about on Cape Cod. The remnants of Hermine tracked across New Brunswick and produced locally heavy rainfall, peaking at about . In Moncton, minor basement flooding and street closures were reported.
===Hurricane Ivan===

A westward-moving tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September 2, before becoming Tropical Storm Ivan on the following day. Tracking westward, Ivan gradually strengthened, reaching hurricane intensity on September 5. On September 6, the storm strengthened significantly, becoming a Category 4 hurricane, despite being located at an unusually low latitude. It subsequently weakened, though it reached major hurricane status again the next day. Late on September 7, Ivan passed close to Grenada while heading west-northwestward. Although located near the Netherlands Antilles on September 9, Ivan briefly became a Category 5 hurricane. During the next five days, Ivan fluctuated between a Category 4 and 5 hurricane. The storm passed south of Jamaica on September 11 and then the Cayman Islands on the next day. Although curving northwestward, Ivan brushed western Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane on September 14.

Shortly after moving to the west of Cuba on September 14, Ivan entered the Gulf of Mexico. Over the next two days, the storm gradually weakened while tracking north-northwestward and northward. At 06:50 UTC on September 16, Ivan made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama with winds of . It quickly weakened inland, falling to tropical storm status later that day and tropical depression strength by early on September 17. The storm curved northeastward and eventually reached the Delmarva Peninsula, where it became extratropical on September 18. The remnants of Ivan moved southward and then southwestward, crossing Florida on September 21 and re-entering the Gulf of Mexico later that day. Late on September 22, the remnants regenerated into Ivan in the central Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression, shortly before re-strengthening into a tropical storm. After reaching winds of , wind shear weakened Ivan back to a tropical depression on September 24. Shortly thereafter, Ivan made a final landfall near Holly Beach, Louisiana with winds of and subsequently dissipated hours later.
Throughout the Lesser Antilles and in Venezuela, Ivan caused 44 deaths and slightly more than $1.15 billion in losses, with nearly all of the damage and fatalities in Grenada. Although Ivan was passing south of Hispaniola, the outer bands of the storm caused four deaths in the Dominican Republic. In Jamaica, high winds and heavy rainfall left $360 million in damage and killed 17 people. The storm brought strong winds to the Cayman Islands, resulting in two deaths and $3.5 billion in damage. In Cuba, a combination of rainfall, storm surge, and winds resulted in $1.2 billion in damage, but no fatalities. Heavy damage was reported along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Along the waterfront of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, nearly every structure was impacted. In the former, 10,000 roofs were damaged or destroyed. About 4,600 homes were demolished in the county. Similar impact occurred in Alabama. Property damage was major along Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay. A number of homes were completely washed away by the high surge. Further inland, thousands of other houses were damaged or destroyed in many counties. Ivan produced a record tornado outbreak, with at least 119 twisters spawned collectively in nine states. Throughout the United States, the hurricane left 54 fatalities and $20.5 billion in damage. Six deaths were also reported in Atlantic Canada.
===Tropical Depression Ten===

A tropical wave accompanied with a well-organized area of convection emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 29. Performing a slow curve over the eastern Atlantic, the wave became increasingly less-defined over subsequent days as a result of strong southwesterly wind shear. Following the development of shower and thunderstorm activity near the center, the system acquired enough organization to be deemed a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on September 7, while positioned about southwest of the southernmost Azores. Hostile environmental conditions caused the depression to remain below tropical storm intensity and subsequently degenerate into a remnant low by 12:00 UTC on September 9 after the center decoupled from the remainder of the convective activity. The low-level circulation persisted near the Azores until dissipating the following day.
===Hurricane Jeanne===

Tropical Depression Eleven developed from a tropical wave at 18:00 UTC on September 13, while located about east-southeast of Guadeloupe. After crossing the island while moving west-northwestward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Jeanne around midday on September 14. It strengthened further in the Caribbean Sea, before making landfall near Guayama, Puerto Rico with winds of at 16:00 UTC the following day. Hours later, Jeanne emerged into the Mona Passage and resumed deepening, becoming at Category 1 hurricane at midday on September 16. Around the time, the hurricane made another landfall at the eastern tip of Dominican Republic with winds of . By early on September 17, Jeanne weakened to a tropical storm due to its slow movement over the rough terrain of Hispaniola, and briefly fell to tropical depression intensity at 18:00 UTC. After re-emerging into the Atlantic, the storm then moved generally northward. After the system passed between the eastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18, slow re-intensification occurred.

Late on September 20, Jeanne again became a Category 1 hurricane; around that time, it began to execute an anti-cyclonic loop. The storm moved eastward, before a trough of low pressure caused Jeanne to curve southeastward. Early on September 22, the system strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. A deep-layer ridge slowly curved Jeanne to the west by the following day, around the time it weakened to a Category 1 hurricane due to upwelled waters. However, the storm began re-intensifying on September 24, becoming a Category 2 hurricane again that day and a Category 3 by September 25. At 14:00 UTC on the latter, Jeanne struck the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas with winds of . The hurricane strengthened slightly further, peaking with maximum sustained winds of . Jeanne made its final landfall on Hutchinson Island, Florida at the same time around 04:00 UTC on September 26. It quickly weakened after moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity only 14 hours later. Curving northward, Jeanne decayed to a tropical depression over Georgia late on September 27. Jeanne turned northeastward and became extratropical over Virginia after about 24 hours. The remnants briefly re-strengthened after moving offshore the Delmarva Peninsula, but dissipated late on September 29.

In Guadeloupe, rainfall amounts up to caused flooding and mudslides throughout the island. Many roads and bridges were inundated or washed out. About 470 homes were damaged or destroyed. Similar impact was reported in Puerto Rico, with heavy precipitation causing flooding and mudslides. There was also heavy damage to crops, schools, houses, and businesses. Strong wind gusts left 70% of the island without power. Jeanne resulted in $169.9 million in damage and eight deaths. In Dominican Republic, major flooding was reported, with rivers overflowing, bridges collapsing, roads cut off, damage to agriculture, and mudslides. Strong winds disrupted telephone services and caused power outages. Overall, hundreds of people became homeless and there was 23 deaths and $270 million in damage. Up to of rain fell on the mountainous region of Haiti, causing extreme flooding and mudslides, especially in the Gonaïves area. Over 200,000 people were left homeless and an estimated 3,006 fatalities occurred. In the Bahamas, communications were disrupted and some homes were inundated by storm surge in the Abaco Islands. Similar impact was reported on Grand Bahama, with several houses and the airport being flooded. Further, winds tore-off and damaged a number of roofs. Throughout the state of Florida, strong winds were observed, leaving approximately 3.44 million people without electricity. Additionally, more than 101,611 homes were impacted by the storm, almost 14,000 of which severely or beyond repairs. Several other states experienced severe flooding. Overall, there were five deaths and about $7.5 billion in damage in the United States.
===Hurricane Karl===

A strong tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on September 13 and proceeded westward. The wave gradually became better organized, and the NHC designated it Tropical Depression Twelve on September 16, while the system was located about west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. That afternoon, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl. Due to healthy outflow around an upper-level anticyclone and warm sea surface temperatures of the year, rapid deepening began on the evening of September 17, with the storm developing a small eye. Karl intensified into a hurricane early on September 18. Late in the evening of September 18, Karl attained Category 3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen while maintaining a well-defined eye, moving northwestward across the open Atlantic. The storm briefly deepened to a Category 4 hurricane on September 20, before weakening slightly and subsequently re-strengthening to that intensity. With a steadily increasing wind field, Karl peaked with maximum sustained winds of early on September 21 while resuming a northwestward motion.

After reaching its peak intensity, Karl weakened due to increasing wind shear, as well as an eyewall replacement cycle. The hurricane weakened to a Category 2 hurricane on September 22 as it curved to the northeast in response to a baroclinic trough. After wind shear lessened, Karl briefly became a major hurricane again on September 23. However, wind shear returned later that day and ocean temperatures began cooling. Another trough re-curved Karl northward on September 24 as the storm was gradually weakening. Early on September 25, Karl became extratropical while located about east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The remnants of Karl accelerated northeastward and then east-northeastward, later moving through the Faroe Islands. Sustained winds up to and gusts reaching were observed on Mykines. The extratropical remnants of Karl moved ashore western Norway on September 28, dissipating soon as it was absorbed into another extratropical low.
===Hurricane Lisa===

At 18:00 UTC on September 19, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen, which was centered located about west-southwest of Cape Verde. Despite unfavorable conditions due to outflow from nearby Hurricane Karl, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Lisa on September 20. After nearly reaching hurricane status, Lisa began executing a small cyclonic loop due to a Fujiwhara interaction with a tropical wave. Additionally, the interaction caused Lisa to weaken to a tropical depression on September 23. As Lisa merged with the tropical wave, convection became difficult to distinguish between the two systems, although Lisa maintained a distinct low-level circulation throughout the merger. During the next several days, the storm fluctuated in intensity, from a tropical depression to a strong tropical storm. A deep mid- to upper-level trough caused Lisa to turn northward on September 25.

By October 1, a short-wave trough re-curved and accelerated Lisa toward the northeast. The storm strengthened and was finally upgraded to a hurricane at 06:00 UTC on October 2. At that time, Lisa attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . After sea surface temperatures dropped to around , Lisa weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm later on October 2. The storm lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC on October 3. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of Lisa were absorbed by a frontal zone while located about of Cape Race, Newfoundland.
===Tropical Storm Matthew===
A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 8, while located about southeast of Brownsville, Texas. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew about six hours later. The storm moved generally northeastward or northward throughout its duration. After briefly weakening, Matthew attained its peak intensity late on October 9, with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . At 11:00 UTC on October 10, Matthew made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana with winds of . Only an hour later, Matthew weakened to a tropical depression and became extratropical early on October 11.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall in southeastern Louisiana, with a peak total of near Haynesville. Along the coast, storm surge up to was observed at Frenier. A combination of storm surge and heavy rainfall inundated numerous roads in Lafourche, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany, and Terrebonne parishes. About 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish were damaged, while several others were flooded in Lafourche Parish. A tornado also damaged the roof of a trailer in Golden Meadow. Winds resulted in electrical outages for approximately 2,500 customers. The storm cracked water lines in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents without tap water. Overall, losses in Louisiana reached $255,000. In Mississippi, storm surge caused coastal flooding in Hancock County. Damage in the state totaled only $50,000.
===Subtropical Storm Nicole===
The interaction between an upper-level trough and a decaying cold front led to the development of a low-pressure area on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda. Although it lacked a well-defined center of circulation, the system was already producing gale-force winds. Early on October 10, the low developed a curved band of convection northwest of the center, and it organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole by 06:00 UTC. An approaching mid-level trough turned the system northeastward. Early on October 11, Nicole passed about northwest of Bermuda. On the island, Nicole and its precursor dropped of rainfall and produced wind gusts reaching . The winds left 1,800 homes and businesses without power, while the unsettled conditions caused delays at the L.F. Wade International Airport.

After passing Bermuda, Nicole developed an area of convection near the center, suggesting the beginning of a transition to a tropical cyclone. However, strong wind shear caused weakening after the storm reached peak winds of , preventing Nicole&#x27;s transition to a fully tropical cyclone. A larger extratropical storm absorbed Nicole on October 11, while the storm was located south of Nova Scotia. In Maine, gusty winds from the remnants of Nicole downed trees and electrical lines, resulting some power outages, especially along or near the coast. Similarly, 11,300 people were left without electricity in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick alone after winds uprooted trees and toppled power lines. Significant rainfall was also produced in the region, peaking at about in northeastern Nova Scotia.
===Tropical Storm Otto===
A cold front and a strong upper-level trough interacted, resulting in the development of an extratropical low-pressure area on November 26. After losing frontal characteristics, the system transitioned into Subtropical Storm Otto at 12:00 UTC on November 29, while located about east-southeast of Bermuda. Initially, the storm moved northwestward due to a weakness in a subtropical ridge. Late on November 29, Otto attained its maximum sustained wind speed of . Deep convection formed near the center and the storm began transitioning to a warm core system.

The system was re-classified as Tropical Storm Otto at 12:00 UTC on November 30, although it is possible that Otto transitioned to a fully tropical cyclone one day earlier, on November 29. Although sea temperatures were relatively cold, Otto did not quickly weaken, because of low wind shear. On December 1, the storm curved southeastward and completed a cyclonic loop later that day. After wind shear began increasing, Otto started weakening and was downgraded to a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on December 2. At that, Otto reached its minimum barometric pressure of . Early on December 3, the storm degenerated into a remnant low while located about southeast of Bermuda.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2004. This was the same list used for the 1998 season, except for &quot;Gaston&quot; and &quot;Matthew&quot;, which replaced &quot;Georges&quot; and &quot;Mitch&quot; respectively. Storms were named &quot;Gaston&quot;, &quot;Matthew&quot;, and &quot;Otto&quot; for the first time in 2004.

===Retirement===

In the spring of 2005, The World Meteorological Organization retired the names of four destructive and deadly storms from the Atlantic hurricanes name lists: &quot;Charley&quot;, &quot;Frances&quot;, &quot;Ivan&quot;, and &quot;Jeanne&quot;. They were replaced with &quot;Colin&quot;, &quot;Fiona&quot;, &quot;Igor&quot;, and &quot;Julia&quot;, for the 2010 season. More names were retired following the 2004 season than had been for any single season since 1995, when four names were also retired; only the 2005 season has had morewith five names retired.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2004 USD.

<text>Roger Maurice Knapman (born 20 February 1944) is a British politician who served as a Conservative MP before becoming Leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

==Early life==
The son of Harry Arthur Blackmore Knapman, a farmer, and Joan Margot née Densham, Roger Knapman was educated at Allhallows School, Lyme Regis, and the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. Before entering politics, he was a Chartered Surveyor and partner with West Country, a firm of livestock auctioneers and surveyors, 1963–77. He was then a Chartered Surveyor in his own right 1978–85.

==Parliamentary career==
As a member of the Conservative Party, Knapman was elected MP for Stroud in 1987, and was Vice-Chairman of the Conservative European Affairs Committee. Between 1990 and 1992, he served as
Parliamentary Private Secretary to the armed forces minister, Archie Hamilton. In this capacity he joined the Conservative Monday Club&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee Delegation to the Croatian Government in October 1991 to observe their war of independence against Serbia. He resigned from his government position in order to oppose the Maastricht Treaty. He successfully defended his seat in the 1992 general election. In 1995 he became a government whip. In 1997, however, he lost his seat to the Labour candidate, David Drew.

==UKIP==
Shortly afterwards, Knapman left the Conservative party to join UKIP. He stood as their candidate in the 2001 general election for North Devon, coming fourth yet narrowly retaining his deposit.

From 2000, he was UKIP&#x27;s political advisor, and in 2002 he was elected unopposed as party leader. In 2004 he was elected a Member of the European Parliament for the South West England constituency. As leader of the only British party in the European Parliament to vote against the expansion of the EU in 2004 (and publicly opposing immigration), there was some amusement in May 2006 when it was revealed that he had employed a team of Polish builders to renovate his Grade II listed home in Devon, claiming there were no suitable local workers – a claim denied by local builders.

He contested Totnes at the 2005 general election, coming 4th with 7.7% of the vote.

In 2006, he announced that he had no intention of seeking re-election as party leader; the leadership contest was won in September of that year by Nigel Farage MEP. Knapman was the only leader of UKIP to have succeeded in completing a full four-year term until Farage did so in 2014 after returning to the role in 2010.

<doc id="723762" wikidata="Q332540" url="?curid=723762" title="Chris Huhne">
<text>Christopher Murray Paul Huhne (born 2 July 1954) is a British energy and climate change consultant, and former journalist, business economist and politician who was the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Eastleigh from 2005 to 2013 and the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change from 2010 to 2012. He is currently chair of the UK green gas association – the Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association – and senior adviser to the World Biogas Association. He also advises companies on his particular interest in renewable technologies that can provide back up for intermittent energy sources like wind and solar.

He formerly wrote weekly columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; and &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. From 1994 to 1999, he built up a business advising on the creditworthiness of countries which is now the sovereign ratings division of one of the three large global ratings agencies, Fitch Ratings.

Huhne had twice stood unsuccessfully for election as Leader of the Liberal Democrats; in 2006 he came second to Sir Menzies Campbell and in 2007 he narrowly lost to Nick Clegg. His political career ended with resignation in February 2013, when he was (with his ex-wife) convicted of perverting the course of justice in relation to speeding offences. He ultimately pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to eight months in prison, serving nine weeks before being released in May 2013.

Huhne was reported in December 2023 to have settled with News Corporation (Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s newspaper holding company that owned the main newspapers responsible for bringing him down, &quot;the Sun&quot;, &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot;) over illegal information-gathering including phone-hacking. Huhne received six-figure damages and his legal costs. Huhne said that News targeted him because he had called for a reopening of the police investigation into phone-hacking (that led to the conviction of Andy Coulson, editor of the &quot;News of the World&quot;) and a judicial inquiry (eventually the Leveson Inquiry).

Huhne was joined by other former Liberal Democrat ministers including Vince Cable and Norman Lamb, and claimed that News had not hacked him just for tabloid titillation but as an attempt to remove him as a critic and to spy on the Government in its intentions on whether to refer Murdoch&#x27;s Sky bid to the competition authorities.

==Early life==

===Education and upbringing===
Huhne was born in west London to businessman Peter Paul-Huhne and actress Ann Murray. He was educated at Westminster School.

He attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a Demy and editor of &quot;Isis&quot;. He also attended the Sorbonne, Paris. At Oxford, Huhne edited the student magazine &quot;Isis&quot;, served on the executive of the Oxford University Labour Club, and achieved a first-class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). He was active in student politics, supporting the Labour Party.

===Career before Parliament===

Huhne was Brussels correspondent of &quot;The Economist&quot; from 1977 to 1980, and then economics editor, leader writer and columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and economics editor, assistant editor and columnist for &quot;The Independent on Sunday.&quot; He was the business editor of &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; during its investigations into Robert Maxwell&#x27;s fraud on the Mirror group pension fund. He started as an undercover freelance reporter in India during Indira Gandhi&#x27;s emergency when western journalists had been expelled. He also worked for the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot; as its Brussels correspondent between 1977 and 1980. He won both the junior and senior Wincott awards for financial journalist of the year in 1980 and 1989 respectively. Along with his work in newspapers and magazines he co-wrote the book &quot;Debt &amp; Danger: The World Financial Crisis&quot; (Penguin, 1985) with Harold Lever, and wrote &quot;Real World Economics&quot; (Penguin 1990).

Before embarking on his political career, he started a company in the City. He told &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2008: &quot;I don&#x27;t claim that I&#x27;m in other than a very happy position compared with most people, because, having spent a bit of time in the City before I was elected, being able to make a bit of money while I was there, I have a cushion.&quot; He started a company called IBCA Sovereign Ratings in 1994 that tried to &quot;measure the risks of investing in different countries&quot;. In 1997 he became group managing director of Fitch IBCA, and from 1999 to 2003 was vice-chairman of Fitch Ratings.

===Parliamentary candidate===
Huhne contested the 1983 general election as a Parliamentary candidate for the SDP–Liberal Alliance in Reading East coming second, and in the 1987 general election he was the SDP–Liberal Alliance candidate in the Oxford West and Abingdon seat, a seat that would be won ten years later by Liberal Democrat candidate Evan Harris.

==Member of European Parliament (1999–2005)==
In June 1999 Huhne was elected as a member of the European Parliament for South East England. The Liberal Democrats came third with a total of 228,136 votes behind the Conservatives and Labour. The proportion of votes received meant that the party was able to send the top two list candidates to the European Parliament, Emma Nicholson the top list candidate and Chris Huhne, second on the list. During the 2004 European Parliament elections Huhne was re-elected along with Emma Nicholson with the party having received 338,342 votes, 15% of the total vote. In 2005 Huhne stood for election to the United Kingdom parliament representing the seat of Eastleigh in Hampshire. After he was elected as a Member of the House of Commons on 5 May 2005, Sharon Bowles, the candidate third on the Liberal Democrat list, replaced Huhne as representative for the South East of England.

During his time in the European Parliament, Huhne was the only Liberal Democrat MEP in a ranking by &quot;The Economist&quot; of the three highest-profile UK MEPs (the others being Glenys Kinnock and Caroline Lucas). He was a member of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, concerned with economic and financial policy including regulation of the financial sector. He was economic spokesman for the pan-European Liberal group in the European Parliament and was responsible for introducing &quot;sunset clauses&quot; – time limits on powers – into European Union law for the first time, for radically amending Commission proposals on financial services, and for opening up the European Central Bank to greater scrutiny.

In addition to his European Parliament responsibilities, he was also active in the development of Liberal Democrat policy as chairman of four policy groups: broadcasting and the media, globalisation, the introduction of the euro, and the reform of public services. On public services, he argued that money was a necessary condition of improvement, but that the key was decentralisation and democratic control; local voters needed to be able to hold local decision-takers to account.

==Member of Parliament==
Huhne was first elected to represent Eastleigh at the general election on 5 May 2005, a constituency within the area for which he was previously the Member of the European Parliament. David Chidgey, the previous MP for the constituency, was also a Liberal Democrat who won his seat in what was historically a Conservative area in a by-election in 1994 following the death of Stephen Milligan. The result in 2005 was close, with Huhne winning with a majority of 568 over Conservative rival Conor Burns. In the 2010 general election Huhne retained his seat with an increased majority of 3,864 over Conservative Maria Hutchings. He was appointed as Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds on 5 February 2013, which vacated his seat and thus ended his tenure as Member of Parliament for Eastleigh. In accepting this office, he became the first official Liberal or Liberal Democrat MP to resign a parliamentary seat since 1941.

===Treasury spokesman===
Following his election to the House of Commons then Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy made Huhne the party&#x27;s shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury. In this role Huhne led the party&#x27;s debate on the 2005 Finance Bill, suggesting that amendments should be made to stop a pensions loophole which would have allowed a 40% discount on property and other investments. In the pre-budget report for 2006, the Chancellor conceded the change.

===2006 leadership contest===

Huhne stood against Sir Menzies Campbell and Simon Hughes for the Liberal Democrat leadership following Charles Kennedy&#x27;s resignation, formally launching his campaign on 13 January 2006.

Huhne was able to carve out a distinctive position on the issue of green taxation . He argued for a radical expansion of taxes on pollution, allowing for reductions in the income tax rate on the lowest paid. This theme endeared Huhne to environmentalists and market liberals alike, allowing him to pick up supporters as the campaign went on. He also argued for a repeal of elements of the Labour government&#x27;s anti-terrorism legislation, which many felt had undermined British civil liberties, and for the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq within a year. He described himself as a &#x27;social liberal&#x27;.

Although the majority of Liberal Democrat MPs declared their support for Menzies Campbell, Huhne did receive endorsements from some party notables including Lord Maclennan and William Rodgers. Amongst the media, &quot;The Economist&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; supported his leadership bid. He was backed from early on by a number of bloggers, and gained much momentum from an internet campaign.

In the final vote, Huhne finished runner-up, tallying 21,628 votes to Menzies Campbell&#x27;s 29,697. Campbell appointed him as the Liberal Democrat&#x27;s environment spokesman in the subsequent frontbench reshuffle, in order for Huhne to develop a viable programme to expand on his green campaign themes.

During the election campaign, a news story in &quot;The Independent&quot; on 27 February 2006, reported that an unsigned document entitled &quot;Chris Huhne&#x27;s Hypocritical Personal Share Portfolio&quot; was being circulated at Lib Dem leadership election meetings. The document alleged that Huhne had invested in companies that the document described as &quot;unethical&quot;. The document stated: &quot;Chris Huhne is campaigning for the Lib Dem leadership on a green, carbon-neutral platform, and further advocates increasing tax for the wealthy, which would include himself. However, his shareholdings include, or have included, mining companies, oil companies and tax shelters.&quot;

===Environment spokesman===
The intellectual energy surrounding Huhne&#x27;s leadership campaign did much to inform the Liberal Democrats&#x27; recent political agenda. His proposals for realigning green taxes and income tax – the &quot;green tax switch&quot; – were at the heart of the fiscal package endorsed at the party&#x27;s September 2006 conference.

Huhne was involved in developing his party&#x27;s thoughts on climate change and the environment, including a consideration of the challenges and opportunities they create for British businesses. He also drew attention to what he said was the divergence between the Conservative Party&#x27;s environmental rhetoric and its policies.

Huhne was one of fourteen MPs forming an all-party parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism in the UK. Their report criticised boycotts of Israeli academics as &quot;an assault on academic freedom and intellectual exchange&quot; and accused &quot;some left-wing activists and Muslim extremists [...] of using criticism of Israel as &#x27;a pretext&#x27; for spreading hatred against British Jews&quot;. Huhne is, however, a critic of Israeli government policy in the Middle East, and strongly supports the creation of a separate Palestinian state. He described the Israeli response in Lebanon to Hezbollah&#x27;s rocket attacks as disproportionate and counter-productive, arguing that a strong Lebanese state is in Israel&#x27;s long-term interest.

In March 2007 it was falsely reported that he had written to executives at Channel 4 to try and stop their showing &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot;. In an e-mail exchange with Iain Dale, Huhne stated that he only wrote to ask for the channel&#x27;s comments, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; later ran a correction and apologised for the misunderstanding, saying it was happy to accept that &quot;Mr Huhne&#x27;s letter was not an attempt to prevent the film being shown or suppress debate on the issue&quot;.

After Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg announced his intention, during the 2007 party conference, to stand for the leadership should Menzies Campbell retire, Chris Huhne, when asked about his leadership ambitions, said that there was: &quot;no vacancy, and it would be premature to even talk about the position of there being a vacancy&quot;.

===2007 leadership contest===
Following Sir Menzies Campbell&#x27;s resignation on 15 October 2007, Huhne was considered to be one of the strongest contenders for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats. On 17 October, he became the first member of the party to announce his candidacy, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve decided to give it a go&quot; and declaring his vision of a &quot;fairer and greener society&quot;. Huhne said that he wanted the party to be committed to the idea that &quot;everybody&#x27;s individual worth and chance is given its full possibility.&quot;

On 28 October 2007, Huhne announced that he had secured the support of 10 of his 62 parliamentary colleagues for his formal nomination. His rival Nick Clegg announced the support of 33 MPs. Huhne also claimed backing from at least twelve peers, four MSPs, and three Welsh Assembly members. After former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown announced his support for Clegg, a previous Liberal leader Lord Steel declared his support for Huhne, based in part on Huhne&#x27;s position on the Trident nuclear programme.

In the last week of campaigning, his team were bullish about his chances, predicting a win. In the final count, the party membership chose his rival Nick Clegg by a narrow margin of 511 votes out of more than 41,000 counted.

About 1,300 postal votes were caught up in the Christmas post and missed the election deadline. An unofficial check of the late papers showed Huhne had enough votes among them to hand him victory. Huhne stood by the result, saying: &quot;Nick Clegg won fair and square on the rules counting the ballot papers that arrived in by the deadline. There is no question of any re-run.&quot; Following the leadership election, Clegg chose Huhne to be the party&#x27;s Home Affairs Spokesman.

====Election conduct====
During the leadership election, Nick Clegg registered a formal complaint about Huhne&#x27;s conduct to Chris Rennard, the party&#x27;s Chief Whip and returning officer. Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in: &quot;the politics of innuendo, mounting false challenges and running a campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party&#x27;s political opponents.&quot; Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Politics Show&quot; on Sunday 18 November 2007, when presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show&#x27;s production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday. The document excoriated Clegg on a number of policy and political issues and was titled &quot;Calamity Clegg&quot;. When challenged about the document, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the document title but agreed with the points within it. Asked how it was possible that he had no knowledge of such a major document sent to the producer of the show he was due to appear on, Huhne replied: &quot;It&#x27;s quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office... But I can assure you that&#x27;s not had my authorization.&quot; After Clegg complained about what he called &quot;dirty tricks&quot; and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne&#x27;s campaign manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an &quot;over-zealous researcher&quot; and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release. &quot;The document title had not been approved before the document was sent out and neither Chris nor I were aware of it.&quot;

Speaking to the Independent on 21 November 2007, Huhne claimed: &quot;Unfortunately it was a mixture of responsibilities. It was an over-zealous young researcher who was responsible for drawing up the document.&quot; The researcher was not on his staff, he said, denying that, as a former journalist, he might have been expected to read what was put out in his name before it was issued.

===Home Affairs spokesman===

In October 2008, as Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson, Huhne led the Liberal Democrat response to the government&#x27;s announcement of plans to expand the capacity to collect records of people using electronic communications. The Home Secretary&#x27;s announcement was in response to warnings by police and the security services that the growing fragmentation and complexity of communications was hindering their tackling of terrorism and organised criminality. But Huhne disagreed with the government&#x27;s response to the police and security services, saying: &quot;The Government&#x27;s Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying. I hope that this consultation is not just a sham exercise to soft-soap an unsuspecting public.&quot;

In January 2009, Huhne was credited with uncovering an instance of data loss of government information caused by a courier company losing a computer disc containing bank details of up to 2,000 public servants working for the British Council. Huhne blamed the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, and the government for the courier company&#x27;s loss and said that the incident was an example of why the UK should not have identity cards: &quot;This is another instance in a long line of slapdash data protection by government departments. If Whitehall cannot look after its own data records it should not be trusted with the personal information of every citizen as it wants with the identity card scheme.&quot;

On 6 November 2007, Huhne made remarks about the Speaker of the House of Commons on the BBC television programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; in which he claimed that the Speaker, Michael Martin, had fallen asleep during a speech by the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. &quot;The Speaker unfortunately fell asleep during Gordon Brown&#x27;s speech ... I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m allowed to say that, but he reacted in an entirely understandable way to what was not the most riveting of parliamentary occasions.&quot; After the remarks were repeated in several publications, Huhne made a public apology to the Speaker in the House of Commons on 8 November in which he withdrew his prior comments. &quot;It was wrong of me to draw the Chair into a matter of political dispute. I hope you will accept I intended no personal offence and fully withdraw my comments.&quot;

====Support for scientific advisor====
Huhne was an avid supporter of Professor David Nutt after he was dismissed by Home Secretary Alan Johnson as chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in November 2009. Nutt had criticised the government&#x27;s decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug rather than keeping it as a class C. Huhne said the decision to sack Nutt was &quot;disgraceful&quot; and commented: &quot;what is the point of having independent scientific advice if as soon as you get some advice that you don&#x27;t like, you sack the person who has given it to you?&quot;. Attacking the government, he said that if they did not want to take expert scientific advice they might as well have a &quot;committee of tabloid newspaper editors to advise on drugs policy&quot;. Cannabis had been re-classified as a class C drug in 2004 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett, only for Jacqui Smith to reverse the ruling in 2008, a decision taken despite official advisers recommending against it.

====Expenses claims====
As part of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; investigation into expense claims by MPs, Huhne was reported to have claimed for various items including groceries, fluffy dusters and a trouser press. In 2006, he claimed £5,066 for painting work on his garden fences and chairs. He collected £119 for a Corby trouser press from John Lewis but later said he would repay the cost in order &quot;to avoid controversy&quot;. He later claimed on a live Channel 4 news programme that he needed the trouser press to &quot;look smart&quot; for work. Huhne&#x27;s office running costs during the 2007/2008 financial year were the 206th highest out of 645, his second home claims were 580th highest (or 65th cheapest) out of 645, and his total expense claims were below average, ranking 418th most expensive.

Huhne was one of sixteen ministers whose assets were held in a blind trust.

==Coalition Government (2010–2012)==
Following the 2010 general election, Huhne became a member of the Liberal Democrats&#x27; key negotiating team alongside Danny Alexander, David Laws and Andrew Stunell that brokered the agreement to go into a governing coalition with the Conservatives. Following the negotiations and the formation of a full coalition Huhne was appointed Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, the tenth most senior minister in the new government. There had been some speculation that Huhne might be appointed as Home Secretary, as he had been the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Home Affairs in the preceding three years, although this post went to the Conservative Theresa May. He was appointed as a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010.

===Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change===
A vocal environmentalist, Huhne accepted the role of Secretary of State with the stated intention of making the nation more ecologically conscious. Among his first actions was launching National Wind Week by speaking at an event in London&#x27;s Leicester Square on 15 June 2010. Underscoring his personal commitment to wind power, Huhne erected an 8-foot wind turbine at his constituency home in Eastleigh.

====Position on nuclear energy====
In government, Huhne maintained a flexible approach on the subject of nuclear energy, advocating the three-pronged &quot;portfolio&quot; approach to energy: a commitment to nuclear energy; the development of more renewable energy, such as wind and sea power; and new carbon-capture technology to mitigate the damaging environmental effects of fossil fuel-fired power plants and industrial facilities. In an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot; in March 2011, following the Fukushima disaster in Japan, Huhne stated that: &quot;there are a lot of issues outside of the realm of nuclear safety, which we will have to assess. One is what the economics of nuclear power post-Fukushima will be, if there is an increase in the cost in capital to nuclear operators.&quot; This represents an evolution of his approach to the nuclear issue. In 2007, Huhne was quoted as saying: &quot;Nuclear is a tried, tested and failed technology and the government must stop putting time, effort and subsidies into this outdated industry.&quot;

====Cancellation of Sheffield Forgemasters loan====
In June 2010, Huhne supported the cancellation by the Business Department of an £80 million loan to Sheffield Forgemasters which had been pledged by the preceding Labour government to build power plant components. He was criticised by Labour Shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband who said that the money for the loan had been set aside and would have resulted in at least £110 million returning to the Exchequer. On 1 July 2010, Huhne replied to Miliband saying: &quot;The loan to Sheffield Forgemasters was not a commercial loan. If it was a commercial loan it would have been arranged through the banks and not by the government. It was precisely because of the public subsidy element, and the fact that the public subsidy element was not affordable, that the government decided not to proceed with it.&quot; The cancellation of the loan was one of a number of projects agreed by the previous Labour government cancelled in an announcement to the House of Commons on 17 June 2010.

====Cancun climate change conference====
On 9 December 2010, Huhne represented the United Kingdom at COP16. The gathering, at which over 190 countries were represented, announced a deal to curb climate change which Prime Minister David Cameron described as a &quot;very significant step forward.&quot; The agreement struck in Mexico included a recognition that deeper cuts in carbon emissions were needed and that a fund should be set up to help developing countries reduce their carbon emissions. Huhne described the deal as a &quot;serious package&quot; of measures but acknowledged that there was still more work to do prior to the next climate change meeting in Durban, South Africa, the following year. Following the conference, David Cameron said that his government would be the &quot;greenest ever&quot; and that Britain would meet its international obligations regarding climate change.

====Support for AV referendum campaign====
Huhne was an enthusiastic supporter of the AV campaign (Alternative Vote Referendum) and attacked anti-AV campaigners such as his cabinet colleague, Conservative Party chairman Baroness Warsi.If Baroness Warsi thinks that AV will benefit fascism she has to explain why the BNP wants to stick with what we have and Operation Black Vote supports AV. The BNP know the present system is their only chance of election. This is another example of the increasingly Goebbels-like campaign from the anti-AV people, for whom no lie is too idiotic given the truth is so unpalatable to them. AV makes lazy MPs work harder and reach out beyond their tribe. It is what Britain needs to clean up politics.

====Resignation====
On 3 February 2012, Huhne resigned from the Cabinet when he was charged with perverting the course of justice over a 2003 speeding case. His wife at the time, Vicky Pryce, had falsely claimed that she was driving the car, and accepted the licence penalty points on his behalf so that he could avoid being banned from driving. Huhne denied the charge until the trial began on 4 February 2013 when he changed his plea to guilty, resigned as a member of Parliament, and left the Privy Council. He and Pryce were sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on 11 March to eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice. He served nine weeks of this sentence at HMP Leyhill in Gloucestershire before he was released.

On 5 February 2013 Huhne resigned as an MP following his plea of guilty to perverting the course of justice. In a subsequent article for the &quot;Guardian&quot; during his second period of writing a weekly column for the paper, he said that he believed he was targeted by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Group newspapers because of the support he had given, while Shadow Home Secretary, for the re-opening of the police investigation into phone-hacking. The subsequent police investigation led to the prosecution and conviction of Andy Coulson, formerly editor of the &quot;News of the World&quot;.

==Career since Parliament==
Huhne has been an adviser and consultant on energy and climate change since his resignation from parliament. In August 2013, Huhne was appointed European Chairman of Zilkha Biomass Energy. The firm makes wood chip pellets in the United States. Huhne was also a consultant for Nationwide Energy Services, an energy saving company. Until 2014 Huhne was a weekly columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He has also provided consultancy services for start-ups in his particular specialism of despatchable renewables (like biogas and biomass). From 2014 to 2018, Huhne was the senior adviser for the trade body that represents renewable natural gas (biogas) plants in the UK, the Anaerobic Digestion &amp; Bioresources Association (ADBA). He became chair of ADBA in June 2022, and is also senior adviser to the World Biogas Association.

== Depictions ==
In February 2010 Huhne was played by Alan Parnaby in the television film &quot;On Expenses&quot; and in 2015 by Rob Vowles in television film &quot;Coalition&quot;.

==Personal life==
Huhne married Greek-born economist Vicky Pryce (formerly Chief Economist in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) in 1984 shortly after she divorced her first husband, with whom she had two daughters. Huhne and Pryce have three children together. In a video statement made during the 2007 Liberal Democrats&#x27; leadership election campaign, Huhne described his philosophy about family life: &quot;Relationships, including particularly family relationships, are actually the most important things in making people happy and fulfilled&quot;. Talking about his wife to &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2008 he stated: &quot;I also have a very hard-working and extremely intelligent wife, who manages to earn far more than I do.&quot;

In June 2010, Huhne admitted that he had been involved in a relationship with Carina Trimingham and stated that he had decided to leave his wife to be with her. Huhne&#x27;s wife and children were unaware of his behaviour and plans. Within one week of Huhne&#x27;s declaration, Pryce filed for divorce on the grounds of Huhne&#x27;s &quot;admitted adultery&quot;. Trimingham had worked on Huhne&#x27;s campaigns for the Liberal Democrat leadership in 2006 and 2007 and was a paid staff member on his 2010 general-election campaign. She was press officer for Brian Paddick during the 2008 Mayor of London election, and was campaigns director at the Electoral Reform Society. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said: &quot;What goes on in people&#x27;s private lives is a subject that fascinates the tabloid press but is irrelevant to the job they are trying to do.&quot; Huhne and Pryce divorced in January 2011.

===Personal interests===
Apart from climate change, &quot;Electoral reform&quot; is among the personal interests that Huhne cites on his biography on the official Liberal Democrats website. He describes his other interests as &quot;European single currency, economics, Third World debt and development, Europe&quot;.

Huhne is or was a member of the European Movement, Green Lib Dems, Association of Liberal Democrat Trade Unionists and the National Union of Journalists.

===Publications and writing interests===
Prior to his careers as a financial journalist, analyst and politician, Huhne wrote four books that are mainly on the themes of either Third-World debt and development, or European integration. His latest book is entitled &quot;Both Sides of the Coin&quot; (1999, with James Forder), in which he argues the case for British membership in the euro. His first was &quot;Debt and Danger&quot; (Penguin Special, 1985), an analysis of the 1984 Third World debt crisis co-written with Lord Lever of Manchester, the former Labour cabinet minister.

He was a contributor to &quot;The Orange Book&quot; (2004), in which he advocates reforms to the United Nations and international governance. Huhne was critical of the most controversial article in the &quot;Orange Book&quot;, in which David Laws proposed an insurance-based National Health Service. He did not take part in the successor volume, &quot;Britain after Blair&quot; and has voiced dismay at the way its predecessor was presented as a break with the party&#x27;s social liberal traditions. More recently, he contributed to the book &quot;The City in Europe and the World&quot; (2005) and two articles to &quot;Reinventing the State&quot; (2007) edited by Duncan Brack, Richard Grayson and David Howarth. These cover the case for localism in which Huhne argues that there is no contradiction between localism and equality, and the need for environmental policy to tackle climate change.

Huhne has also written articles for &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;New Statesman&quot;. While an MEP, he wrote a weekly column for the London Evening Standard on European matters.

==Criminal conviction==

In May 2011 Huhne&#x27;s estranged wife Vicky Pryce approached a reporter for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; with a claim that Huhne had &quot;pressurised people to take his driving licence penalty points&quot; on his behalf in 2003. Huhne denied the allegations of perverting the course of justice. Essex Police said: &quot;We take allegations such as this one extremely seriously and will take action where necessary.&quot;

Essex Police sent initial papers to the Crown Prosecution Service regarding the allegations and Huhne exercised his right to remain silent in response to police questions in May. On 25 June 2011, Essex Police said that a judge at the Crown Court at Chelmsford had granted them a court order to take possession of a recording from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in which the ex-couple apparently discussed the case. It then emerged that Huhne had again been interviewed by police concerning the allegations, and on 28 July the police handed the file to prosecutors. On 17 August 2011, the Crown Prosecution Service remitted the matter to Essex Police with a direction to investigate the matter further. On 25 August 2011, Essex Police re-submitted the case to the CPS. A decision on whether criminal proceedings would be instituted for the alleged offence was expected to be made by the end of September 2011.

On 28 October 2011, the Crown Prosecution Service again referred the matter to Essex Police for further investigation, having completed a &quot;full review&quot; of the allegations. At a private hearing in October 2011, a judge in the Crown Court at Chelmsford ordered &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to produce email messages between Pryce and the newspaper&#x27;s political editor in relation to the police investigation. On 22 November, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer announced that the CPS was &quot;very close&quot; to deciding whether to prosecute. The reason for the delay was that &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was seeking judicial review of the court order the CPS had obtained. Starmer stated &quot;we do not shy away from prosecuting politicians&quot;. The judicial review hearing was scheduled for 20 January 2012. On that date &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; dropped its application for judicial review and said that it would comply with the court order for delivery of the documents.

The emails were delivered to Essex Police, who said there was no need to conduct further interviews.

Starmer created some controversy about the prospect of a fair trial by personally announcing on television on 3 February 2012 that both Huhne and Pryce had been charged with perverting the course of justice. Huhne thereupon resigned from the Cabinet. As a result of his resignation, and in accordance with the rules governing severance payments to resigning ministers, Huhne received a tax-free payment of £17,000. Huhne and Pryce appeared before Mr Justice Saunders in the Crown Court at Southwark on 2 March 2012. A trial was timetabled for early October 2012, with the possibility that the case might start earlier. Neither defendant entered a plea and both were granted unconditional bail. At a plea and case management hearing on 1 June 2012, Huhne announced his intention to apply to the court to have the charge dismissed. Pryce entered a plea of not guilty, and indicated a defence at trial of marital coercion: that is, that her then husband coerced her into taking his penalty points and that she committed the crime in his presence. On 5 October 2012, the trial was adjourned until 14 January 2013 for &quot;legal reasons&quot; which were not disclosed. On 28 January 2013, Huhne was arraigned and pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to the indictment. A new trial date was set for 4 February 2013.

On 4 February Huhne pleaded guilty on re-arraignment, and was appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds, the formal means of resigning his seat in Parliament. This triggered a by-election. He was remanded on unconditional bail until sentencing at a date to be notified.

In February 2013, at the trial of Vicky Pryce it was revealed that Constance Briscoe had been arrested in relation to statements she had made to police that she had not had any involvement with the leaking of the driving licence points-swapping story. Briscoe was arrested on 6 October 2012. She was later convicted, sentenced to 16 months in prison and disbarred. Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the jury that Briscoe and Pryce had &quot;started it together by approaching a man called Andrew Alderson (a journalist working for the Mail on Sunday)&quot;, falsely claiming that one of Huhne&#x27;s aides, Jo White, took points for him in 2003. Edis stated that Briscoe was a neighbour and friend of Pryce and that the &quot;two of them appear to have cooked up a plan&quot; to bring about Huhne&#x27;s downfall.

On 11 March 2013, Huhne and Pryce were each sentenced to eight months&#x27; imprisonment. Huhne started serving his sentence in HM Prison Wandsworth but was reportedly transferred to HM Prison Leyhill in Gloucestershire. On the day after sentencing, David Burrowes MP wrote to the Attorney-General Dominic Grieve, asking him to exercise his power of referral to the Court of Appeal, as in Burrowes&#x27;s view the sentences were too lenient. Grieve had until 8 April – 28 days after the original sentence – to decide whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal, which has the power to increase sentences.

Huhne and his ex-wife were released on 13 May 2013, having both served two months of their eight-month sentences. Following their release, both were subject to electronic tagging. Huhne was required to stay in his home between 7 pm and 7 am. Huhne described prison as &quot;a humbling and sobering experience&quot;.

<doc id="723774" wikidata="Q913501" url="?curid=723774" title="FIFA Women's World Ranking">
<text>The FIFA Women&#x27;s World Ranking is a ranking system for women&#x27;s national teams in association football (commonly known as football or soccer) published by the international governing body FIFA. , the United States is ranked #1.

The rankings were introduced in 2003, with the first rankings published on 16 July of that year. FIFA attempts to assess the strength of internationally active women&#x27;s national teams at any given time based on their past game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. , the ranking has 194 national teams.

The ranking has more than informative value, as it is often used to seed member associations into different pots in international tournaments.

==Specifics of the ranking system==
*FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings are based on every international match a team ever played, dating back to 1971, the first FIFA-recognized women&#x27;s international between France and the Netherlands.
*FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings are implicitly weighted to emphasize recent results.
*FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings are only published four times a year. Normally, rankings are released in March, June, September and December. (In World Cup years, dates may be adjusted to reflect the World Cup results.)

The first two points result from the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Rankings system being based on the Elo rating system adjusted for football; in 2018, FIFA modified the men&#x27;s ranking system to similarly be based on Elo systems after continued criticism. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional and at the end of the list. In addition, any team that plays no matches for 4 years becomes unranked; this inactivity limit was previously 18 months, but was extended in early 2021 (after the COVID-19 pandemic stifled a significant amount of international play).

==Ranking schedule==
Rankings are generally published four times a year. The next update is scheduled for 6 March 2025.

== Leaders==

As of the 16 August 2024 rankings release, the United States is the number one ranked team. The United States holds the record for the longest consecutive period leading the rankings of nearly 7 years, from March 2008 to December 2014.

Before the 2023 World Cup, the United States and Germany had been the only two teams to lead the women&#x27;s rankings, and these two teams also had held the top two spots in all but six releases, when Germany was ranked third (only Norway, Brazil, England and Sweden had reached second during this time).


==Ranking calculations==
The rankings are based on the following formulae:

:formula_1

:formula_2

:formula_3

Where
The average points of all teams are about 1300 points. The top nations usually exceed 2000 points. In order to be ranked, a team must have played at least more than 5 matches against officially ranked teams, and have not been inactive for the last 48 months up to the date the rankings are published. Even if teams are not officially ranked, their points rating is kept constant until they play their next match.

=== Actual result of the match ===
The main component of the actual result is whether the team wins, loses, or draws, but goal difference is also taken into account.

If the match results in a winner and loser, the loser is awarded a percentage given by the accompanying table, with the result always less than or equal to 20% (for goal differences greater than zero). The result is based on the goal difference and the number of goals they scored. The remaining percentage points are awarded to the winner. For example, a 2–1 match has the result awarded 84%–16% respectively, a 4–3 match has the result awarded 82%–18%, and an 8–3 match has the result awarded 96.2%–3.8%. As such, it is possible for a team to lose points even if they win a match, assuming they did not &quot;win by enough&quot;.

If the match ends in a draw the teams are awarded the same result, but the number depends on the goals scored so the results will not necessarily add up to 100%. For example, a 0–0 draws earns both teams 47% each, a 1–1 draw earns 50% each, and a 4–4 draw earns 52.5% each.
&quot;Source&quot;

=== Neutral ground or home vs. away ===
Historically, home teams earn 66% of the points available to them, with away teams earning the other 34%. To account for this, when two teams are not playing on neutral ground, the home team has its formula_4 inflated by 100 points for the purposes of calculation. That is, if two equally ranked teams playing at one team&#x27;s home ground, the home team would be expected to win at the same rate a team playing on neutral ground with a 100-point advantage. This 100 point difference corresponds to a 64%–36% advantage in terms of expected result. The scaling factor remains the same (&quot;c&quot;=200).

<text>Cornelis Jacobszoon Drebbel (; 1572 – 7 November 1633) was a Dutch engineer and inventor. He was the builder of the first operational submarine in 1620 and an innovator who contributed to the development of measurement and control systems, optics and chemistry.

==Biography==
Cornelis Drebbel was born in Alkmaar, Holland in an Anabaptist family in 1572. After some years at the Latin school in Alkmaar, around 1587, he attended the Academy in Haarlem, also located in North-Holland. Teachers at the Academy were Hendrik Goltzius, engraver, painter, alchemist and humanist, Karel van Mander, painter, writer, humanist and Cornelis Corneliszoon of Haarlem. Drebbel became a skilled engraver on copperplate and also took an interest in alchemy.

In 1595 he married Sophia Jansdochter Goltzius, younger sister of Hendrick, and settled at Alkmaar. They had at least six children, of whom four survived. Drebbel worked initially as a painter, engraver and cartographer. But he was in constant need of money because of the prodigal lifestyle of his wife . In 1598 he obtained a patent for a water-supply system and a sort of perpetual clockwork. In 1600, Drebbel was in Middelburg where he built a fountain at the Noorderpoort. In that spectacle-making center he may have picked up knowledge in the art of lens grinding and later would construct a magic lantern and a camera obscura.

Around 1604 the Drebbel family moved to England, probably at the invitation of the new king, James I of England (VI of Scotland). He was accommodated at Eltham Palace. Drebbel worked there at the masques, that were performed by and for the court. He was attached to the court of young Renaissance crown-prince, Henry. He astonished the court with a demonstration of a perpetual motion machine, automatic and hydraulic organs and his optical Instruments.

His fame went through the courts of Europe. In October 1610 Drebbel and his family moved to Prague on invitation of Roman-German Emperor Rudolf II, who was preoccupied with the arts, alchemy and occult sciences. Here again Drebbel demonstrated his inventions. When in 1611 Rudolf II was stripped of all effective power by his younger brother Archduke Matthias, Drebbel was imprisoned for about a year. After Rudolf&#x27;s death in 1612, Drebbel was set free and went back to London in 1613. Unfortunately his patron prince Henry had also died and Drebbel was in financial trouble. With his glass-grinding machine he manufactured optical instruments and compound microscopes with two convex lenses, for which there was a constant demand.

At the request of Roman-German Emperor Ferdinand II in 1619, he went to Prague again to tutor his sons and was taken prisoner after the Battle of White Mountain and the capture of Prague in 1620, where he also lost his fortune. In 1622 Constantijn Huygens stayed as a diplomat for more than one year in England. It is quite possible that he learned the art of glass grinding at this time from Drebbel, and that he passed this knowledge to his second son Christiaan Huygens, who became a prominent Dutch mathematician and scientist. The English natural philosopher Robert Hooke may have learned the art of glass grinding from his acquaintance Johannes Sibertus Kuffler, the son-in-law of Drebbel.

Towards the end of his life, in 1633, Drebbel was involved in a plan to drain the Fens around Cambridge, while living in near-poverty running an ale house in England. He died in London.

In keeping with traditional Mennonite practice, Drebbel&#x27;s estate was split between his four living children at the time of his death.

==Works==
Drebbel was an empirical researcher and innovator. His constructions and innovations cover measurement and control technology, pneumatics, optics, chemistry, hydraulics and pyrotechnics. He registered several patents with the Dutch &quot;Staten Generaal&quot;. He also wrote essays about his experiments with air pressure and made beautiful engravings; including The Seven Liberal Arts on a map of the city of Alkmaar. He was involved in making theater props, moving statues and in plans to build a new theater in London. He worked on producing torpedoes, naval mines, detonators that used glass Batavian tears, and worked on fulminating gold (&quot;aurum fulminans&quot;) as an explosive.

He was known for his Perpetuum Mobile, built an incubator for eggs and a portable stove/oven with an optimal use of fuel, able to keep the heat on a constant temperature by means of a regulator/thermostat. He designed a solar energy system for London (perpetual fire), demonstrated air-conditioning, made lightning and thunder ‘on command’, and developed fountains and a fresh water supply for the city of Middelburg. He was involved in the draining of the moors around Cambridge (the Fens), developed predecessors of the barometer and thermometer, and harpsichords that played on solar energy.

===Chemistry===
Drebbel&#x27;s most famous written work was &quot;Een kort Tractaet van de Natuere der Elementen&quot; (A short treatise of the nature of the elements) (Haarlem, 1621). He was also involved in the invention of mercury fulminate. He also discovered that mixtures of “spiritus vini” with mercury and silver in “aqua fortis” could explode.

Drebbel invented a chicken and a mercury thermostat which automatically kept it stable at a constant temperature; one of the first recorded feedback-controlled devices. He also developed and demonstrated a working air conditioning system. The invention of a working thermometer is also credited to Drebbel.

====Scarlet dye====
The story goes that, while making a coloured liquid for a thermometer Cornelis dropped a flask of aqua regia on a tin window sill, and discovered that stannous chloride makes the colour of carmine much brighter and more durable. Although Cornelis did not make much money from his work, his daughters Anna and Catharina and his sons-in-law Abraham and Johannes Sibertus Kuffler set up a very successful dye works. One was set up in 1643 in Bow, London, and the resulting colour was called bow dye. The recipe for &quot;colour Kufflerianus&quot; was kept a family secret, and the new bright red colour was very popular in Europe.

===Optics===

Drebbel is credited with developing an automatic precision lens-grinding machine, improved telescopes, the first compound microscope (&#x27;lunette de Dreubells&#x27;), camera obscura, laterna magica, and Dutch or Batavian tears

====Compound microscope====

One of the optical devices some historians believe Drebbel invented when he was working for the Duke of Buckingham was the compound microscope. The device appeared in Europe around 1620 with the earliest account being Dutch Ambassador Willem Boreel&#x27;s 1619 visit to London where he saw a compound microscope in Drebbel&#x27;s possession, described as an instrument about eighteen inches long, two inches in diameter, and supported on 3 brass dolphins. In 1621 Drebbel had a compound microscope with two convex lenses. Several of his contemporaries, including Christiaan Huygens, credited the invention of the compound microscope to Drebbel. The invention has many counter claims including Dutch spectacle-maker Johannes Zachariassen&#x27;s claim that Drebbel stole the idea from him and his father, Zacharias Jansen, and claims that Galileo Galilei used his telescope after 1610 as a type of compound microscope. In 1624 Galileo saw Drebbel&#x27;s design for a microscope in Rome and created an improved version of it to send to Federico Cesi, founder of the Accademia dei Lincei, who used it to illustrate &quot;Apiarum&quot;, his book about bees.

===Submarine===
He also built the first navigable submarine in 1620 while working for the English Royal Navy. He manufactured a steerable submarine with a leather-covered wooden frame. Between 1620 and 1624 Drebbel successfully built and tested two more submarines, each one bigger than the last. The final (third) model had 6 oars and could carry 16 passengers. This model was demonstrated to King James I in person and several thousand Londoners. The submarine stayed submerged for three hours and could travel from Westminster to Greenwich and back, cruising at a depth between 12 and 15 feet (4 to 5 metres). Drebbel even took King James in this submarine on a test dive beneath the Thames, making King James I the first monarch to travel underwater. This submarine was tested many times in the Thames, but it couldn&#x27;t attract enough enthusiasm from the Admiralty and was never used in combat.

==Cultural references==
Cornelis Drebbel has been honoured on postage stamps issued by the postal services of both Mali and the Netherlands in 2010.

A portrayal of Cornelis Drebbel and his submarine can be briefly seen in the film &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974). A small leatherclad submersible surfaces off the coast of England, and the top opens clamshell-wise revealing Cornelis Drebbel and the Duke of Buckingham.

Drebbel was honoured in an episode of the cartoon &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; during a submarine rescue of workers on a research station in the Arctic. A German U-boat captain fired a pistol in celebration at the mention of Drebbel, to shouts of, &quot;Sieg Heil! Cornelis Drebbel!&quot; Also, on the Sealab 2021 Season 3 DVD, Cornelis Drebbel has two DVD commentaries devoted to the story of his life.

In the Dutch Eighty Years&#x27; War comic Gilles de Geus, Drebbel is a supporting character to the warhero Gilles. He is drawn as a crazy inventor, similar to Q in the James Bond series. His submarine plays a role in the comic.

Richard SantaColoma has speculated that the Voynich Manuscript may be connected to Drebbel, initially suggesting it was Drebbel&#x27;s cipher notebook on microscopy and alchemy, and then later hypothesising it is a fictional &quot;tie in&quot; to Francis Bacon&#x27;s utopian novel &quot;New Atlantis&quot; in which some Drebbel-related items (submarine, perpetual clock) are said to appear.

== Namesake ==
A small lunar crater has been named after him. Several Dutch towns have a street named after him. &quot;Cornelis Drebbelweg&quot; in Delft is one of them.

<doc id="723780" wikidata="Q1334208" url="?curid=723780" title="Graham Watson">
<text>Sir Graham Robert Watson (born 23 March 1956) is a British Liberal Democrat politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South West England from 1994 to 2014. Watson was the chairman of the Parliament&#x27;s committee on citizens rights, justice and home affairs (1999–2002). He then served for seven and a half years as leader of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, first as leader of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Group (2002–2004) and then as leader of the new Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group (2004–2009). From 2011 until 2015, he was the president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. From 2015 to 2020, he was a UK member on the European Economic and Social Committee. He is currently an adjunct Professor at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.

Sir Graham, who holds Italian citizenship through marriage, was chosen as head of list for the 2024 European Parliament election in North East Italy by the centrist coalition &#x27;United States of Europe&#x27; (electoral list). He was not elected since the coalition failed to reach the threshold of votes required nationwide to elect MEPs.

==Early life==
Graham Watson was born in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute (Scotland, United Kingdom), the eldest of six children. His father was an officer in the Royal Navy and his mother a teacher. Watson was educated at the City of Bath Boys&#x27; School following his father’s posting to the Admiralty in Bath. He returned to Scotland to attend Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh where he graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts in modern languages. While at university he spent one semester studying at the University of Geneva and one at Karl Marx University in Leipzig in the German Democratic Republic. At the latter he was spied on by a fellow British student working for the East German &quot;Stasi&quot; (State Security Police): the story of this is told in the book &quot;The Stasi Files&quot; by (Free Press, 2004) and has been the subject of documentary film productions by the BBC and Channel Four. On graduating from university in 1979, Watson worked first as a freelance interpreter and translator and then (1980–83) as an administrator at Paisley College of Technology. He now speaks four European languages.

Watson began his political activity in the Scottish Young Liberals in 1976. As international officer of the Scottish Young Liberals he became involved in the International Federation of Liberal Youth, becoming a vice-president (1977) then General Secretary (1979) of the organization. He was a founder of the European Communities&#x27; Youth Forum. He served as a council member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party between 1983 and 1993. Between 1983 and 1987 he also served as head of the private office of then leader of the British Liberal Party, Sir David Steel.

In 1988 he began work for the bank HSBC in London and Hong Kong. His time there encompassed three months with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and gave him an interest in the Far East. He has travelled widely in the region and speaks some Mandarin Chinese.

==European Parliament==

In the 1994 European Parliamentary election he was elected for Somerset and North Devon with a majority of over 22,500. Watson was the first Liberal Democrat returned from a British constituency to serve in the European Parliament. Accompanied by Robin Teverson, elected later the same night, he sat with the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR). During this term, Watson served on two committees; the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and the Committee on Budgets, and acted as whip for the ELDR group until 1996.

===Second term===
In 1999 the introduction of the list system (a form of proportional representation) in Great Britain for European elections meant Watson&#x27;s constituency was abolished in favour of a larger multi-member constituency encompassing South West England. The South West constituency would later also include Gibraltar, from 2004. Watson was re-elected in this constituency as the sole Liberal Democrat member at the 1999 European Parliamentary election. His party had gained 171,398 votes, 15.7% of the total. During this term he led the ten British Liberal Democrats in the parliament and between 1999 and 2002 he held the chair of the Committee on Citizens&#x27; Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. In that position he steered through Parliament freedom of information provisions and the legislation providing for a European Arrest Warrant. In 2002 he was elected to lead the EU-wide ELDR Group, succeeding Irishman Pat Cox MEP.

===Third term===

Watson was re-elected once more at the 2004 European Parliamentary election with his party winning 265,619 votes (18.3%).

Following the election, Watson was re-elected to lead the ELDR Group and took it into an alliance with Romano Prodi’s newly-formed European Democratic Party to form the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. The ALDE group replaced the ELDR group (though ELDR and EDP existed for a while as separate parties outside the Parliament). Watson was elected leader of the new ALDE group, which was the largest group ever established in the Parliament outside of the European People&#x27;s Party and Party of European Socialists.

===Fourth term===
Watson was elected to a fourth term as an MEP for the South West in the European Parliament elections of June 2009, with the Liberal Democrats winning 266,253 votes (17.07%). Following the election, Watson stood down from the leadership of the ALDE Group, having served in that role for longer than any of his predecessors. He sat on the European Parliament&#x27;s foreign affairs committee and served as Chairman of Parliament&#x27;s Delegation for relations with India. He also chaired a global network of legislators campaigning for a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy known as The Climate Parliament, of which he had been a founder member in the late 1990s. 

==2014 European elections==
Watson lost his seat at the European Parliament in the elections of May 2014, despite his party having polled 10.7% of the vote, the largest vote share of the UK Liberal Democrat party in the 2014 EP election. He established a global advocacy practice, Bagehot Limited, which he ran until reaching retirement age in 2021.

In 2015 Watson was appointed by the UK Government to sit on the European Economic and Social Committee, an advisory body with a five-year mandate. He sat on the Transport and Energy section and on the Foreign Affairs section and from 2015 to 2017 was chairman of the EESC&#x27;s China Contact Group.

==Other activities and family==
Watson lived in Langport, Somerset, from 1994 to 2017. He now lives in Edinburgh and in Brussels. His wife is from Italy and their children, one daughter and one son, were born in 1992 and 1995 respectively.

Watson was knighted in the 2011 Birthday Honours for political and public service. He is also the recipient of honours from the Republic of China (Taiwan), Georgia and Gibraltar.

From 2018 to 2023 Watson served as Chairman of the Advisory Board of the European Centre for Populism Studies. In 2021 he was elected to the Board of the European Cyclists&#x27; Federation and in November 2022 was elected Chairman of the World Cycling Alliance.

Watson is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates democratic reform of the United Nations.

<text>The Town of East Hampton is a town in southeastern Suffolk County, New York United States. It is located at the eastern end of the South Shore of Long Island. It is the easternmost town in the state of New York. At the time of the 2020 United States census, it had a total population of 28,385.

The town includes the village of East Hampton, as well as the hamlets of Montauk, Amagansett, Wainscott, and Springs. It also includes part of the incorporated village of Sag Harbor.

East Hampton is located on a peninsula, bordered on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by Block Island Sound and to the north by Gardiners Bay, Napeague Bay and Fort Pond Bay. To the west is western Long Island, reaching to the East River and New York City. The Town has eight state parks, most located at the water&#x27;s edge.

The town consists of and stretches nearly , from Wainscott in the west to Montauk Point in the east. It is approximately six miles (10 km) wide at its widest point and less than one mile at its narrowest. The town has jurisdiction over Gardiners Island, which is one of the largest privately owned islands in the United States. The town has of shoreline.

== History ==
===Native-American history===

This area had been inhabited for thousands of years by wandering tribes of indigenous peoples. At the time of European contact, East Hampton was home to the Pequot people, part of the culture that also occupied territory on the northern side of Long Island Sound, in what is now Connecticut of southern New England. They belong to the large Algonquian-speaking language family. Bands on Long Island were identified by their geographic locations. The historical people known to the colonists as the Montaukett, who were Pequot, controlled most of the territory at the east end of Long Island.

Indians inhabiting the western part of Long Island were part of the Lenape nation, whose language is also in the Algonquian family. Their territory extended to lower New York, western Connecticut and the mid-Atlantic coastal areas into New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Their bands were also known by the names of their geographic locations but did not constitute distinct peoples.

In the late-17th century Chief Wyandanch of the Montaukett negotiated with English colonists for the land in the East Hampton area. The differing concepts held by the Montaukett and English about land and its use contributed to the Montaukett losing most of their lands over the ensuing centuries. Wyandanch&#x27;s elder brother, the grand sachem Poggaticut, sold an island to English colonist Lion Gardiner for &quot;a large black dog, some powder and shot, and a few Dutch blankets.&quot; The next trade involved the land extending from present-day Southampton to the foot of the bluffs, at what is now Hither Hills State Park, for 24 hatchets, 24 coats, 20 looking glasses and 100 muxes.

In 1660, Chief Wyandanch&#x27;s widow signed away the rest of the land from present-day Hither Hills to the tip of Montauk Point for 100 pounds, to be paid in 10 equal installments of &quot;Indian corn or good wampum at six to a penny&quot;. The sales provided that the Montaukett were permitted to stay on the land, to hunt and fish at will, and to harvest the tails and fins of whales that beached on the East Hampton shores. Town officials who bought the land filed for reimbursement from the colony for the rum with which they had plied the tribe during negotiations. Gradually, however, colonists stopped the Montaukett using the land by preventing them from hunting and fishing. They were said to interfere with the crops on their farms, in a conflict similar to the later farmer-rancher arguments of the Old West.

Many of the Montaukett died during the 17th and 18th centuries from epidemics of smallpox, a Eurasian disease carried by some English and Dutch colonists and endemic in their communities, to which the Indians had no immunity. After the American Revolution, some Montaukett relocated with Shinnecock to Oneida County in western upstate New York, led by the Mohegan missionary Samson Occom, to try to escape the settlers&#x27; civilization. They formed the Brothertown Indians with other Indians from New England, and gave up some of their traditions. In 1831-1836, the Brothertown Indians migrated to Wisconsin, where they founded the settlement of Brothertown.
Some Montaukett continued to live on Long Island. In the mid to late nineteenth century, their most well-known member was Stephen Talkhouse. Their area on Lake Montauk was called Indian Fields until 1879. With their population reduced, over the years the Montaukett intermarried with other peoples of the area, but brought up many of their descendants as Montaukett in their culture. When Arthur W. Benson brought a government auction of Montauk, New York, in which he bought nearly the entire east end of the town, he evicted the Montaukett. They relocated to Freetown, a community established by free people of color on the northern edge of East Hampton Village. The tribe made several attempts to get the courts to declare the evictions illegal, but the court ruled in favor of the evictions. Since the 1990s, the Montaukett have pressed for formal recognition as a tribe. The Shinnecock Indian Nation, many of whom had continued to occupy a portion of land on the South Shore and claimed it as their reservation, received federal recognition in 2010 as a tribe and also have state recognition. Historically both groups were part of the larger Pequot people.

Montaukett artifacts and sweat lodges are visible from trails at Theodore Roosevelt County Park. The park was formerly called Montauk County Park.

===Anglo-European settlement===
East Hampton was the first English settlement in the state of New York. In 1639 Lion Gardiner purchased land, what became known as Gardiner&#x27;s Island, from the Montaukett people. In 1648 a royal British charter recognized the island as a wholly contained colony, independent of both New York and Connecticut. It kept that status until after the American Revolution, when it came under New York State and the Town of East Hampton authority.

On June 12, 1640, nine Puritan families from Lynn, Massachusetts landed at what is now known as Conscience Point, in Southampton; some later migrated to present-day East Hampton. Among the first English settlers in East Hampton were John Hand, Thomas Talmage, Daniel Howe, Thomas Thomson, John Mulford, William Hedges, Ralph Dayton, Thomas Chatfield and Thomas Osborn.

The Mulford Farmhouse, on James Lane, is the best-preserved 17th-century English colonial house in East Hampton. The barn dates to 1721, and the complex is operated as a living museum. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house was built in 1680 for Josiah Hobart, a prominent early settler, named in the first formal deed of conveyance of East Hampton. This was known as the East-Hampton or Dongan Patent. The 1686 instrument granting the Town of East Hampton to its new proprietors was signed by Thomas Dongan, then Governor of New York. The patent named Capt. Hobart one of &quot;Trustees of the freeholders and commonalty of the town of East-Hampton&quot;. Sons of Rev. Peter Hobart, founding minister of Old Ship Church in Hingham, Massachusetts, Josiah Hobart and his brother Joshua both migrated to Long Island with their families. Josiah Hobart settled in East Hampton, where he served as High Sheriff of Suffolk County. His brother Joshua, a minister, went to Southold, where he served the town for 45 years.

Isaac Van Scoy from Amagansett wed Mercy Edwards in February 1757, and during the spring of that year, the couple relocated to the region referred to as Northwest or Alewife Brook Neck, located approximately six miles north of East Hampton Village. This Northwest &quot;Ghost town&quot; settlement during the mid 1800s saw development due to Northwest Harbor, later it was deemed too shallow for deep draft ships and the harbor moved to Sag Harbor, leading to the settlements demise.
East Hampton was the third Connecticut settlement on the East end of Long Island. East Hampton formally united with Connecticut in 1657. Long Island was formally declared to be part of New York (and also subject to English law) by Charles II of England after four British frigates captured what is today New York City, releasing East Hampton from its Connecticut governance.

East Hampton was first called Maidstone, after Maidstone, Kent, England. The name was later changed to &quot;Easthampton&quot;, reflecting the geographic names of its neighbors, Southampton and Westhampton. In 1885 the name was split into two words, after the local newspaper the &quot;East Hampton Star&quot; began using the two-word name. &quot;Maidstone&quot; is frequently used in place names throughout the town, including the Maidstone Golf Club.

Deep Hollow Ranch, established in 1658 in Montauk, is the oldest continuously operating cattle ranch in the United States.

===Whaling===

While East Hampton was developed originally for agriculture, the settlers soon discovered that whales frequently beached along the South shore of the town. The whales could be carved up for food and oil. Town laws were written to regulate the proper handling of such carcasses. As the demand for whale products grew, residents became more aggressive in their harvesting techniques. No longer content to settle for harvesting beached whales, they began harvesting live whales that were coming near shore.

Northwest Harbor, located at Northwest Landing on Gardiner&#x27;s Bay, was the town&#x27;s first harbor. The harbor turned out to be too shallow for large ships, so a larger port was developed two miles (3 km) West, at Sag Harbor. Some accounts say that it was named because of its relation to the settlement of Sagaponack, New York in the Town of Southampton.

At the peak of the whaling industry, in 1847, some 60 whale ships were based in Sag Harbor, employing 800 men in related businesses. Herman Melville made numerous references to this village in his novel, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. The port rivaled that of New York. After 1847 the whaling industry dropped off dramatically because of the rise of alternative fuel products.

Among the sea captains of Sag Harbor were ancestors of politician Howard Dean, who was born in East Hampton.

The most famous voyages out of Sag Harbor were those by Mercator Cooper. In 1845 he was on an American ship that picked up shipwrecked Japanese sailors in the Bonin Islands and returned them to Tokyo. In 1853 Cooper traveled with an expedition to the far South, where he broke through the ice shelf to become the first person to touch East Antarctica.

The Town of East Hampton is still highly influenced by maritime businesses, including tourism. It attracts large summer crowds of residents and tourists. Montauk is New York state&#x27;s largest fishing port. The Town is famed for its commercial sports fishing, made particularly famous by Frank Mundus. One of the largest buildings in the town is the Promised Land fish meal factory at Napeague.

===Presidents and First Ladies===
First Ladies Julia Gardiner Tyler and Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis spent their childhoods there. Theodore Roosevelt was briefly quarantined in Montauk, at Camp Wyckoff, after returning from the Spanish–American War. Bill and Hillary Clinton spent week-long summer vacations in 1998 and 1999.

====Julia Gardiner Tyler====
Julia Gardiner was born on Gardiners Island and her father had a house in East Hampton village. On February 28, 1844, she and her father, David Gardiner, were part of the Presidential party aboard the when a malfunctioning cannon exploded. Her father and two Cabinet officers were killed. According to legend Julia fainted into the arms of President John Tyler (who had earlier lost his first wife). They married four months later, creating a national scandal, since there was a 30-year difference in their ages.

Although Tyler was a member of the wealthy Gardiner family and a former First Lady of the United States, she had economic problems after the American Civil War. She and her husband had supported the Confederate States of America. She is buried with the President in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital during the war and the capital of Virginia. Her father and one of her sons are buried in the South End Burial Ground in East Hampton.

====Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis====
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born at Southampton Hospital on July 28, 1929. She would have been born in New York City but she was six weeks late. Her parents, Janet Norton Lee and John Vernou Bouvier III, known as &quot;Black Jack,&quot; were staying at Lasata, the East Hampton home of her paternal grandfather, Major John Vernou Bouvier Jr.

Her parents had been married at St. Philomena&#x27;s Catholic Church in East Hampton on July 7, 1928. The reception was held at the East Hampton village home of her maternal grandparents, James T. Lee and Margaret Lee, located on Lily Pond.

Her family were members of the Maidstone Club. She and her younger sister, Lee Bouvier, spent their summers at the house in East Hampton until she was 10, when her parents divorced. Her connection to East Hampton received renewed national attention in the 1970s. It was covered in news reports following the release of the 1975 documentary &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;, which explored the lives of her aunt, Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, and cousin, Edith Bouvier Beale. They were revealed to be living in poverty in a mansion of that name. Jacqueline and her husband Aristotle Onassis donated money to improve the lives of her relatives. (The documentary was adapted as a Broadway musical of the same name. A documentary on the estate was released in 2006.)

Jacqueline&#x27;s aunt and uncle, Winifred Lee and Franklin d&#x27;Olier, continued to own the Lily Pond Lane home of her maternal grandparents until 2002. The Bouvier family cemetery plot is at Most Holy Trinity Catholic Cemetery on Cedar Street. Jackie&#x27;s father, maternal grandmother, paternal grandparents, and paternal great-grandparents, as well as various relatives, including Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, are buried in the cemetery.

====Bill and Hillary Clinton====
In 1998 and 1999 as talk surfaced that Hillary Clinton was considering a Senate run from New York, they began summering in East Hampton, where they stayed at the Georgica Pond home of Steven Spielberg. Clinton gave a Saturday radio chat from the Amagansett fire station.

In June 2008, at the conclusion of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s Presidential bid, she stayed at the Wiborg Beach home of Thomas H. Lee in East Hampton Village.

===African-American history===
East Hampton has played an important role in African-American history. After the American Revolutionary War, New York passed a gradual abolition law, making children free who were born to slave mothers. But the last slaves were not freed until 1827. During the War of 1812, the Gardiners used slaves to transport supplies back and forth to Gardiner&#x27;s Island. According to the Gardiners, slaves were easier to pass through British blockades since it was &quot;obvious&quot; that they were &quot;owned.&quot;

During this period Sag Harbor rose to a port status, rivaling New York, due to its whale oil trade. Many slaves worked on the docks in connection with shipping and the whale trade. After slavery had ended, Gardiner&#x27;s former slaves developed small houses in Freetown (East Hampton), just north of East Hampton village. Sag Harbor&#x27;s freedmen developed the Eastville community in Sag Harbor.

In 1808 the United States and Great Britain cooperated in ending the African slave trade, but Spain continued to transport slaves to its Caribbean and Latin American colonies. On August 26, 1839, crew from &quot;La Amistad&quot;, an illegal slave ship that had been commandeered by its captives off Cuba, dropped anchor at Culloden Point and came ashore at Montauk to get supplies. The slaves, who were inexperienced navigators, thought they were on course to Africa. Members of the U.S. Navy ship USS &quot;Washington&quot;, seeing the slaves on shore, arrested them and took them to Connecticut.

This was an international case, with Spain arguing for the return of the ship and slaves (or compensation). The United States had its own laws to interpret. The Mende people who had been illegally taken argued for their freedom. &quot;Amistad&quot; case was ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1841. John Quincy Adams argued for the Africans. The court decided in their favor, opining that the initial capture of the Mende by the Spanish was illegal, so they were classified as free men defending their freedom and were not charged under slave law with mutiny or revolt. East Hampton film director Steven Spielberg popularized the slave revolt and Supreme Court case in the 1997 film &quot;Amistad&quot;.

One of the &quot;Amistad&quot; former slaves stayed in the United States after the trial. He worked as a valet for President John Tyler. He was killed aboard USS &quot;Princeton&quot; along with David Gardiner and two Cabinet officers, when one of the cannons exploded during a demonstration.

In 1845 African-American sailor Pyrrhus Concer of Sag Harbor was aboard the &quot;Manhattan,&quot; a ship captained by Mercator Cooper, which picked up shipwrecked Japanese sailors in the Bonin Islands. The ship was allowed to enter Tokyo Bay under escort to return the sailors. As Japan had been closed to foreign shipping, it was the first American ship to visit Tokyo. Concer was the first African American the Japanese had seen. He is depicted in their drawings of the event.

===Playground for the rich===

East Hampton from its earliest days with the settlement of Gardiners Island has had a reputation as being a home for the wealthy especially after the Gardiners married into almost all the wealthy New York City families.

More than one hundred miles from Manhattan, East Hampton remained largely undeveloped until 1880 when Austin Corbin extended the Long Island Rail Road from Bridgehampton to Montauk. As part of the development, Arthur W. Benson forced an auction and paid US$151,000 for 10,000 acres (40 km2) around Montauk. He forced the eviction of the Montaukket Native Americans there.

Benson brought in architect Stanford White to design six &quot;cottages&quot;, mansions near Ditch Plains in Montauk. They formed the Montauk Association to govern their exclusive neighborhood. With new access to the village of East Hampton from New York, wealthy families ventured east from Southampton and built mansions in East Hampton. The Maidstone Golf Club opened in 1891. Among the early &quot;cottages&quot; was Tick Hall, later owned in the late 20th century by TV figure Dick Cavett. It burned in 1993, but Cavett had it restored. He had the process filmed for a television documentary.

Corbin had industrial ambitions associated with extending the train to Montauk. He thought a new port city would develop around the train station on Fort Pond Bay, and that oceangoing ships from Europe would dock there. Passengers could take the train into New York City–thus saving a day in transit.

The grand plans for Montauk did not pan out. The land was sold to the United States Army. Theodore Roosevelt made a much publicized visit to Camp Wyckoff there at the end of the Spanish–American War.

In 1926, Carl G. Fisher intended to revive the dream of an urban Montauk, with plans to develop it as a destination, the Miami Beach of the north. He bought the former Benson property for $2.5 million (it was sold as surplus government property following the end of World War I). He built the six-story Montauk Improvement Building in downtown Montauk (which is still the town&#x27;s tallest occupied structure—as subsequent zoning has forbidden highrise structures), the Montauk Manor (which was a luxury hotel), dredged Lake Montauk and opened it to Block Island Sound to support his Montauk Yacht Club and the associated Star Island Casino, as well as the Montauk Downs golf club.

Fisher lost his fortune in the Stock Market Crash of 1929. The land was sold back to the military in World War II. During World War II, the Army developed its land for Army, Navy and Air Force bases.

Through the years, East Hampton&#x27;s wealth has evolved. The village has grown, and former farmland dominated by potato fields has been developed for residential housing. The village of East Hampton is considered to have the most dazzling row of mansions, located along Further Lane and Lily Pond Lane parallel to the ocean.

While ostentatious displays of wealth occurred near the ocean (&quot;south of the Montauk Highway&quot;), much simpler houses and bungalows have been built in such areas as Springs and Montauk. In the 1950s and 1960s, following the Kitchen Debate between Nikita Khrushchev and Richard Nixon, more cheap affordable prefabricated homes called Leisurama were built as second homes in Montauk at Culloden Point.

In November 2006, the median price of a house in the Town was US $895,000 compared with a national median for the U.S. of $225,000. Several houses in East Hampton now sell for prices in the tens of millions of dollars. Living in East Hampton is relatively expensive, in 2007 the cost of living was 168% of the national average.

The entertainer and businessman Sean Combs held many of his White Parties at his house on Hedges Banks Drive in East Hampton. The &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that in the 2000s &quot;few events held the cultural cachet&quot; that the White Parties did. The parties saw a broad range of social and cultural elites socialising together as &quot;veteran celebrities mixed with of-the-moment stars and the high-society set at gatherings that often had civic-minded causes&quot; according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;. The writer Steven Gaines said that initially the residents of The Hamptons thought &quot;the first party was the end of the world ... They were afraid of a noisy showbiz crowd and thought it was going to be an invasion, and it turned out not to be&quot;. Combs&#x27;s neighbors in the Hamptons were pacified with limousine rides and complimentary meals at expensive restaurants to abate noise complaints.

====Service community====
A portion of the community consists of working people who provide services to the wealthy community. The service community within the town of East Hampton is centered in Springs which contains the more modest housing available.

===Artists&#x27; colony===
East Hampton&#x27;s reputation as an artists&#x27; colony began with painter Jackson Pollock, who resided in Springs, New York in the 1940s and 1950s, with Lee Krasner, at what is now known as the Pollock-Krasner House and Studio. Many of his most famous paintings were painted in the barn, which he had converted into a studio. The property is now open to the public for tours, by appointment. It is now owned by Stony Brook University with scheduled appointments to view his studio, which was left unchanged after his death.

Among the other artists who popularized East Hampton as an artists&#x27; colony were Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Ian Hornak, Larry Rivers, Alfonso Ossorio, Robert Motherwell, Andy Warhol, John Ferren, Thomas Moran, Louis Schanker, and Charlotte Park as well as art dealers Leo Castelli and Ileana Sonnabend.

Pollock died in 1956 while driving with his mistress, Ruth Kligman, and a friend of hers, on Springs Fireplace Road, after picking them up at the Long Island Railroad station in East Hampton.

Pollock and Krasner are buried in Green River Cemetery, in Springs, along with many of the artists of their generation. Pollock&#x27;s influence continues to be felt in the community.

Marcia Gay Harden won a 2000 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for portraying Krasner in Pollock, which was shot in East Hampton as the dream project of Ed Harris, who was also nominated for Best Actor.

An ongoing debate rages over whether 24 paintings and drawings found in a Wainscott locker in 2003 are Pollock originals. Physicists have argued over whether fractals can be used to authenticate the paintings. The debate is still inconclusive.

Andy Warhol and his longtime collaborator, Paul Morrissey, had a large, waterfront estate in Montauk called &quot;Eothen&quot;. Among their guests were Jacqueline Onassis, Lee Radziwill, the Rolling Stones, Bianca Jagger, Jerry Hall, Liza Minnelli, Elizabeth Taylor, John Lennon, John Phillips, and Halston.

In 1993, the Andy Warhol Foundation donated of the estate to the Nature Conservancy for the Andy Warhol Visual Arts Preserve, which is run in conjunction with Art Barge in nearby Napeague.

===Natural disasters===

Two major natural disasters that affected East Hampton include the Hurricane of 1938 and Hurricane Carol, in 1954, both of which found the Atlantic Ocean splitting the town in two at Napeague. The 1938 storm also washed up so much sand that the Cedar Point Lighthouse, which had been on an island, became connected to the mainland. The 1954 storm also toppled the MacKay Radio towers at Napeague.

East Hampton does not have the barrier beaches that run almost the entire length of the south shore of Long Island from Coney Island to Southampton. East Hampton&#x27;s ocean beaches are connected to the mainland, which prevents them from being washed over in storms.

Due to storms on Fort Pond Bay, the hamlet of Montauk was actually moved by the Navy at the end of World War II. The hamlet was originally located at the train station, but was constantly being flooded.

East Hampton is regularly hit by hurricanes and Nor&#x27;easters. Given the town&#x27;s generally flat topography, water often accumulates on town roads stranding motorists in heavy rains.

The town&#x27;s most serious environmental problem is beach erosion. The town has severely restricted development on ocean front property, thus limiting impact. The Montauk Lighthouse, which used to be almost from the cliffs is now from the cliffs. The most threatened areas now are in the hamlet of Montauk, which is the only community in the town with its business district next to the ocean, as are the oceanfront estates of East Hampton. At Georgica Pond the United States Corps of Engineers built Groynes to protect the mansions. The construction is a source of friction with Southampton, which says the jetties interrupt the longshore drift, greatly increasing beach erosion there.

The lack of beach front development, including the fact there are no boardwalk promenades, which are features of many developed beach communities, has contributed to East Hampton beaches being listed among the best beaches in the country.

===Military history===
While East Hampton is considered almost exclusively a residential community, it has been the home of United States Navy, United States Army, and United States Air Force bases, the last of which closed in the 1980s. It currently has a United States Coast Guard headquarters.

Skirmishes and military incidents took place in the town from the 17th century through World War II.

====Massacre Valley====

The biggest recorded loss of life in the various skirmishes and conflicts in East Hampton was &quot;Massacre Valley&quot; in 1653 in Montauk when 30 members of the Montaukett tribe were killed by members of the Narragansett tribe at the foot of what is now Montauk Manor.

The Montauketts had a thriving wampum (made from whelk shells on the East Hampton beaches) trade Connecticut tribes. The arrangements were disrupted in 1637 by the Pequot War which was to solidify English domination of New England and change the balance of power among Native American tribes.

The Pequot War was to contribute to the Montauketts selling Gardiners Island, East Hampton and Southampton to the English with the understanding the English would protect the Montauketts from attacks from Connecticut. However a war broke out between the Montauketts and the Narragansett, the nominal Native American victors in Pequot War.

In 1653 the Narragansetts under Ninigret attacked and burned the Montaukett village, killed 30 and captured one of Wyandanch&#x27;s daughters. The daughter was ransomed with the aid of Lion Gardiner (who in turn was to get large portion of Smithtown, New York in appreciation). The Montauketts temporarily moved closer to East Hampton village and the English ordered ships in Long Island Sound to sink Narragansett canoes. The skirmishes were to end in 1657.

====Captain Kidd====
East Hampton had pirates on its waterways in the 17th century and early 18th century, the most notable of which was Captain Kidd who was hanged after his booty on Gardiners Island was introduced at his trial.

Kidd is said to have buried treasure all over Long Island. He parted ways after his east indian adventures with his quartermaster, Hendrick van der Heul, at Little Northwest Creek, near Sag Harbor in 1699 after dividing up the booty from the voyage. Money Ponds at the Montauk Lighthouse are named because of treasure reported to have been left there.

In June 1699 Kidd was stopped on the island while sailing to Boston to try to clear his name. With the permission of the proprietor, Mrs. Gardiner, he buried $30,000 in treasure in a ravine between Bostwick&#x27;s Point and the Manor House. For her troubles he gave her a piece of gold cloth (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library) that was captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar, as well as a bag of sugar. Kidd warned that if it was not there when he returned he would kill Gardiner. Kidd was tried in Boston and Gardiner was ordered to deliver the treasure as evidence. The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks and porringers. Gardiner kept one of the diamonds, which he gave his daughter. A plaque on the island marks the spot, but it&#x27;s on private property.

====American Revolution====
In 1775 the British first ventured toward Long Island at Fort Pond Bay at Montauk during the Siege of Boston. John Dayton, who had limited troops at his disposal, feigned that he had more by walking them back and forth across a hill turning their coats inside out to make it look like there more of them (a tactic referred to as &quot;Dayton&#x27;s Ruse&quot;). The British would not formally attack Long Island until 1776.

After the fall of Long Island during the Battle of Long Island, the East Hampton ports of Northwest and Sag Harbor were blockaded by the British and the British used Gardiner&#x27;s Island for a hunting preserve.

The first American victory in New York after the Battle of Long Island was Meigs Raid on Sag Harbor (sometimes called the Battle of Sag Harbor) when continentals from Connecticut raided the British earth works in the village and burned the ships and wharfs on the East Hampton side of the village. The Americans killed six and transported 90 British prisoners back to Connecticut without losing a single soldier.

A story often circulated is the story of Isaac Van Scoy who had a farm in Northwest. According to the tales the British raided his farmhouse and he killed one soldier with a pitchfork. Van Scoy was reported to have eventually been captured and taken to a prison ship in Sag Harbor where he escaped. The earthen remains of Van Scoy&#x27;s house are still visible in the Northwest Preserve where he is buried (American flags mark his grave on holidays). His name is applied to various placenames in the area including Van Scoy Pond.

The manor house on Gardiners Island had just been built in 1774 and members of the British forces were to use it throughout the war – with or without permission. Among the British guests were Henry Clinton and John André. At one point Major Andre and Gardiner son Nathaniel Gardiner, who was a surgeon for the New Hampshire Continental Infantry, exchanged toasts on the island. Gardiner would later be the American surgeon who attended to Andre when he was executed after being caught spying with Benedict Arnold.

The British fleet used East Hampton waters for blockading Connecticut and planning for a new offense to retake New England (that never took place). One of the ships, , ran aground at what is now called Culloden Point in Montauk during a winter storm on January 24, 1781. The ship was scuttled and burned. In the 1970s remains of the ship were discovered and is now Long Island&#x27;s only underwater park. Remains of the ship can be seen at the East Hampton Marine Museum in Amagansett.

After the war, Gardiners Island which had been considered an independent colony was officially added to New York and East Hampton.

George Washington was to authorize construction of the Montauk Point Lighthouse.

====War of 1812====

During the War of 1812 British frigates once again controlled the northern bays of East Hampton with frigates headquartered in Gardiners Bay particularly harassing ships going into Sag Harbor.

Sag Harbor had a fort manned by 3,000 troops on Turkey Hill. July 11, 1813, One hundred British Marines raided the wharf but were driven back after setting fire to one sloop by Americans led by Capt. David Hand.

During the War of 1812 a British fleet of seven ships of the line and several smaller frigates anchored in Cherry Harbor and conducted raids on American shipping Long Island Sound. Crews would come ashore for provisions which were purchased at market prices. During one of the British excursions, Americans captured some of the crew. The British came to arrest then Lord of the Manor John Lyon Gardiner. Gardiner, who was a delicate man, adopted the &quot;green room defense&quot; where he stayed in a bed with green curtains surrounded by medicine to make him look feeble. The British, not wanting a sick man on board, let him be.

The British were to bury several personnel on the island. Some of the British fleet that burned Washington assembled in the harbor in 1814.

Gardiner&#x27;s supply boats were manned by slaves during the war and this made it easier for them to pass through British lines. Many of the Gardiner slaves were to live in the Freetown (East Hampton), just north of East Hampton (village), New York.

====American Civil War====
During the American Civil War, some of the Sag Harbor whaling ships were scuttled in Charleston, South Carolina harbor to blockade the city.

The USS &quot;Montauk&quot;, a monitor which was constructed at the Continental Iron Works in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, saw considerable action throughout the war. In 1865 the ship, docked at the Washington Navy Yard, was used as the prison for accused Abraham Lincoln assassination conspirators and the autopsy and identification of the body of assassin John Wilkes Booth.

====Spanish–American War====

During the Spanish–American War, the Army built Fort Tyler on Gardiners Point Island in an attempt to protect Long Island.

A more important fort was the massive Camp Wickoff (also called Wyckoff) which stretched from the current Montauk Long Island Railroad station to the Montauk Point Lighthouse.

The area was used to quarantine soldiers coming from the conflict. The most prominent group among the 20,000 soldiers who passed through the base were Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. The tented camp became a national scandal over the poor treatment of troops (256 died there) and President William McKinley visited to emphasize improvements. Exhibits and artifacts from the camp are at Theodore Roosevelt County Park.

====World War I====
During World War I, the E.W. Bliss Company of Brooklyn, New York tested torpedoes in the harbor, a half mile north of Sag Harbor. As part of the process, Long Wharf in Sag Harbor was reinforced with concrete and rail spurs built along the wharf as the torpedoes were loaded onto ships for testing. They were shipped via the Long Island Road, along the Sag Harbor to the wharf which was owned by the railroad at the time. Among those observing the tests was Thomas Alva Edison. Most of the today&#x27;s buildings on the wharf, including the Bay Street Theatre, were built during this time. The torpedoes, which did not have exploding warheads, are occasionally found by divers on the bay floor.

====World War II====
During World War II, coastal fortifications were set up along the eastern tip of Long Island at Montauk. A concrete observation tower as built next to the Montauk Lighthouse. 16 inch naval guns were placed in adjacent bunkers at Camp Hero. The observation tower is still next to the lighthouse and the additional bunkers are visible at Camp Hero State Park as well as Shadmoor State Park.

On June 13, 1942, as part of Operation Pastorius four German agents led by George John Dasch were landed by U202 at what is now Atlantic Avenue Beach (sometimes called Coast Guard Beach) in Amagansett. Confronted by Coast Guardsman John C. Cullen, they said they were Southampton fishermen. When one of the four said something in a foreign tongue, they offered him $300 to keep quiet. The agents disappeared into the night after he sought out his supervisor. When reinforcements arrived they discovered German cigarettes on the beach along with four heavy, waterproof oaken boxes buried in the sand filled with brick-sized blocks of high explosives, bombs disguised as lumps of coal, bomb-timing mechanisms of German make, and innocent-looking “pen-and-pencil sets” that were actually incendiary weapons.

The agents rode the Long Island Railroad into New York City and were ultimately captured along with four others who had come ashore at Jacksonville, Florida. Six of the agents were to be executed.

In May 2007 the original Coast Guard station was moved to the property at the Town Marine Museum in Amagansett across the dunes from its original Atlantic Avenue beach location. The station was moved in 1966 to private property to save it from demolition by Joel Carmichael The Marine Museum itself was the former barracks for the Coast Guard.

The Navy appropriated almost all of Montauk during the war for facilities including Montauk Manor which was used as a dormitory. Torpedoes were tested in Lake Montauk. Ships and dirigibles docked on Navy Road on Fort Pond Bay. The Navy was to find Fort Pond inhospitable since it was shallow. Dredging was to contribute to problems with flooding. After the war the Navy moved the residential section of Montauk which had been on the bay by the Long Island Rail station a mile to the south to get away from the flooding. One of the biggest legacies of the Navy presence was to be the dredging of Lake Montauk so that it replaced Fort Pond as Montauk&#x27;s dock. The Coast Guard is now headquartered there on Star Island.

====Cold War====

After the war, most of the military property was disposed of as surplus, except for gun emplacements at Camp Hero next to the Montauk Point Lighthouse. The camp was designated as an Air Force Base supporting a -wide radar (AN/FPS-35) in the early 1960s to detect potential bombers headed for New York City. The massive radar and supporting state-of-the-art computers quickly became obsolete. While the other radars in this category were torn down, the one on Montauk, was saved largely because it served as a better landmark than did the lighthouse for sailors and ships on Long Island Sound. The base was officially decommissioned in the 1980s. The support buildings now form a ghost town. The radar structure has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1992, Long Island residents Preston B. Nichols and Peter Moon published a science fiction book, &quot;The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time.&quot; They suggested that the radar was used by the government to conduct time travel experiments. Some readers believe their sci-fi account is true. The base has become of cult interest among conspiracy buffs. It was featured in a segment of &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

==Geography==
East Hampton is bounded by Southampton to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Block Island Sound to the east, and Napeague Bay to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (80.76%) is water.

==Climate==
East Hampton has an Oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb). East Hampton has chilly, wet winters and very warm, dry summers due to the moderating influence of the ocean, which suppresses thunderstorm development and moderates summer temperatures. Summers have very warm, sunny, and stable weather, whereas the winters are often stormy due to coastal storms which bring rain but little snow. The region averages only about of snow annually.

== Government ==

The town has two governments, which sometimes are in conflict. The most visible town government is the elected Town Board, which consists of five people, including its head, the Town Supervisor. They are responsible for managing the taxes, roads, police, parks, zoning and general governance of the town. The Town Board was stablished by the State of New York in 1788. The government operates from a campus on Pantigo Road.

The historic, original Town government is known as the &quot;Trustees of the Freeholders and Commonalty of the Town of East Hampton.&quot; Today it is formally responsible for day-to-day decisions related to common property in the town. The Trustees derive their power from the &quot;Dongan Patent&quot; of December 9, 1686, which set up self-governance for the town. The patent (a land grant) establishing the trustees was an act by Thomas Dongan, the Royal Governor of New York. Among the common properties which the trustees operate is Georgica Pond; they decide when the tidal pond is to be drained and filled. These actions often make headlines as they sometimes cause the flooding of basements of neighboring properties owned by celebrities. In 1998, the pond was drained a few days before President Bill Clinton was to spend his summer vacation at the home of Steven Spielberg.

Since the late 20th century, the Town has often approved progressive social initiatives, including domestic partnership registration. In 1999, it imposed a 2 percent tax on residential real estate sales in excess of $250,000 for the purpose of buying open space for preservation. The money has been used in part to the Town&#x27;s establishing more than of trails, including the Paumanok Path. Between 2002 and 2005, the tax raised $71 million. In 2006, the Town adopted a dark skies ordinance, which is now being considered as a model for wider use in New York State to cut down on light pollution at night.

Despite East Hampton&#x27;s great wealth, its fire department and ambulance are both volunteer services, dependent on local full-time residents. In August 1998, President Bill Clinton was to give his weekend radio address from the Amagansett Volunteer Fire Station during his vacation.

Although residences in the town are often featured in architectural magazines, the town offices have been housed for years in several double wide trailers on a lot, hidden from the street by a nondescript flat-roofed building. In 2006, the Town announced plans to convert its campus by adapting a collection of historic East Hampton buildings that had been moved over the course of 30 years to the Further Lane home of Adelaide de Menil, heiress to the Schlumberger oil fortune. In 2006 it was announced that the new Town complex was to be designed by internationally known architect Robert A.M. Stern (who designed the East Hampton Library in 1997).

The transfer of the historic houses to the Town government site was part of the sale of the de Menil to financier Ron Baron for $103 million; in 2007 this was reported as the highest price ever paid for a single residence in United States history.

The township has aggressively pursued zoning ordinances to protect its residential and rural character. It has no chain fast food restaurants and or big box stores (unlike Southampton, which has numerous fast food chains and stores). The village of East Hampton formerly also exercised a &quot;no chain&quot; rule.

===Police===

The East Hampton Town Police Department, commonly referred to as EHTPD, is a professional police organization responsible for primary jurisdictional law enforcement for the town. The headquarters are located at 131 Wainscott Northwest Road, Wainscott, NY 11975 (631) 537-7575. The East Hampton Town Police Department is headed by Chief Michael Sarlo

== Demographics ==
Demographics in East Hampton were skewed by the fact that more than half the houses were owned as second homes (among the owners were some of the wealthiest people in the country). The East Hampton economy was based on retail and services to support the residential community.

As of the census of 2010, there were 21,457 people and 21,038 households residing in East Hampton. The population density was . There were 2,251 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 84.81% White, 26.38% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 3.36% Black or African American, 0.60% Native American, 1.32% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 8.33% from other races, and 1.50% from two or more races.

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,445 households, out of which 27.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.2% were married couples living together, 12.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39.0% were non-families. 31.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.07.

As of the census of 2010, in the town the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 2.2% from 18 to 20, 5.1% from 20 to 24, 11.3% from 25 to 34, 21.5% from 35 to 49, 22.5% from 50 to 64, and 17.6% who were 65 years of age or older. For every 100 females, there were 101.5 males.

As of the census of 2000, the median income for a household in the town was $52,201, and the median income for a family was $55,357. Males had a median income of $38,566 versus $29,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $25,725. 12.2% of the population and 10.3% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 20.5% of those under the age of 18 and 4.2% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

== Special events ==
One of the highlights of the summer is East Hampton Fire Department fireworks display at Main Beach, usually held the Saturday night closest to July 4. The fireworks displays have generated controversy since 2005, when they were postponed because they were considered disruptive to the nearby nesting of the endangered piping plover. In 2005, 2007, and 2008 the fireworks were postponed until Labor Day weekend to protect the birds&#x27; nesting season. The village administration has since postponed the fireworks display to Labor Day weekend indefinitely.

A big draw in the summer had also been the shark fishing tournaments in Montauk. Since 2007, the Humane Society and other animal welfare groups have protested that the tournaments are cruel to the sharks, as they are not being caught for food.

Each summer, the Artists and Writers Softball Game, a charity benefit, is held. Past players have included John Irving, Norman Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, Dustin Hoffman, President Bill Clinton, and singer Paul Simon.

Every October the town hosts the Hamptons International Film Festival, an event screening independent films in several local theaters. It has a fairly large draw from the New York City crowd.

Barefoot Contessa, a Food Network original show, is shot in East Hampton.

<doc id="723789" wikidata="Q7332615" url="?curid=723789" title="Riderless horse">
<text>A riderless horse is a single horse without a rider and with boots reversed in the stirrups, which sometimes accompanies a funeral procession. The horse, sometimes caparisoned in black, follows the caisson carrying the casket. A riderless horse can also be featured in parades (military, police or civilian) to symbolize either fallen soldiers, fallen police officers or deceased equestrian athletes. A motorcycle can be used as a substitute for a horse though such practice is very rare.

==History==
===United States===
In the United States, the riderless horse is part of funerals with military honors given to Army or Marine Corps officers at the rank of colonel or above, as well as funerals of presidents, who served as commander in chief.

Alexander Hamilton, who was Secretary of the Treasury (1789–1795) was the first American to be given the honor. Historian Ron Chernow noted that Hamilton&#x27;s gray horse followed the casket &quot;with the boots and spurs of its former rider reversed in the stirrups.&quot; 

Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated in 1865, was the first president of the United States to be officially honored by the inclusion of a caparisoned horse in his funeral cortege, although a letter from George Washington&#x27;s personal secretary recorded the president&#x27;s horse was part of the president&#x27;s funeral, carrying his saddle, pistols, and holsters.

===Australia===
In Australia, a riderless horse known as the &#x27;Lone Charger&#x27; sometimes leads the annual Anzac Day marches.

==Notable horses==
=== Old Bob ===

In 1865, Abraham Lincoln was honored by the inclusion of a riderless horse at his funeral. When Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train reached Springfield, Illinois, his horse, Old Bob, who was draped in a black mourning blanket, followed the procession and led mourners to Lincoln&#x27;s burial spot.

=== Black Jack ===

Black Jack was a half-Morgan named for General of the Armies John &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing. Black Jack took part in the state funerals of Presidents John F. Kennedy (1963),
Herbert Hoover (1964), and Lyndon Johnson (1973), and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (1964).

=== Dolly ===

&quot;Dolly&quot; was the 22 year old charger (whose official name was Octave) of Admiral of the Fleet The Earl Mountbatten of Burma in his capacity as Colonel of the Life Guards. Following the assassination of Lord Mountbatten by the IRA in Mullaghmore, Dolly served as the riderless horse in the funeral procession being led ahead the head of the gun carriage with the Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s boots (from his Colonel&#x27;s uniform) reversed in the stirrups on 5 September 1979.

=== Sergeant York ===

Sergeant York was formerly known as &quot;Allaboard Jules&quot;, a racing standardbred gelding. He was renamed (in honor of famous WWI soldier Alvin C. York) when he was accepted into the military in 1997. He served as the riderless horse in President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s funeral procession, walking behind the caisson bearing Reagan&#x27;s flag-draped casket. In the stirrups were President Reagan&#x27;s personal riding boots.

He was foaled in 1991, sired by Royce and out of the mare Amtrak Collins sired by Computer. He is a descendant of the great standardbred racing stallions Albatross, Tar Heel and Adios.

<doc id="723793" wikidata="Q307857" url="?curid=723793" title="Abdelaziz Belkhadem">
<text>Abdelaziz Belkhadem (; ; born 8 November 1945) is an Algerian politician who was Prime Minister of Algeria from 2006 to 2008. He was also Secretary-General of the National Liberation Front (FLN). Belkhadem served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2000 to 2005 and Personal Representative of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika from 2005 to 2006; after serving as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2008, he was again appointed as Personal Representative of the Head of State in 2008.

==Political career==
Belkhadem was born in Aflou, Laghouat Province, Algeria. A graduate in literature and economics, he began his professional life in 1964 as a financial inspector and later was a professor of Arabic literature. In 1972, President Houari Boumédiène appointed him as Deputy Director of International Relations at the Presidency, and he held that post until 1977.

As an FLN candidate, Belkhadem was elected to the People&#x27;s National Assembly (APN) in 1977 from Sougueur in Tiaret, and was re-elected as a Deputy from Sougueur in 1982 and 1987. During his time as a Deputy, he was rapporteur of the APN&#x27;s Planning and Finance Committee before being elected as President of the Education, Training, and Scientific Research Committee in 1987. He was Vice-President of the APN from 1988 to 1990 and President of the APN from October 1990 to 1992. Belkhadem was a member of the Political Bureau of the FLN from 1991 to 1997.

Later, Belkhadem was Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from July 2000 to May 2005. As Foreign Minister, he visited Paris in July 2002 to discuss cooperation with French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin. He was Minister of State and Personal Representative of the Head of State (President Abdelaziz Bouteflika) from May 2005 to May 2006. He was appointed as Prime Minister on 24 May 2006, replacing Ahmed Ouyahia.

One of two bombings in Algiers on 11 April 2007 struck near Belkhadem&#x27;s office. He was not harmed in the attack and condemned the bombings as &quot;criminal and cowardly&quot;. At least 23 people were reported killed in the two bombings.

Following the May 2007 parliamentary election, Belkhadem presented the &quot;pro forma&quot; resignation of his government, and it was accepted by President Bouteflika on 1 June. Belkhadem remained in office in a caretaker capacity, along with 11 ministers; the remaining 15, who won parliamentary seats in the election, were required to choose between those seats and their positions as ministers. Bouteflika reappointed Belkhadem as Prime Minister in a new government on 4 June.

Bouteflika appointed Ouyahia as Prime Minister on 23 June 2008, replacing Belkhadem, who was instead appointed for a second time as Minister of State and Personal Representative of President Bouteflika.
