<text>Mazie Keiko Hirono (; Japanese name: , ; born November 3, 1947) is an American lawyer and politician serving since 2013 as the junior United States senator from Hawaii. A member of the Democratic Party, Hirono previously served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 2007 to 2013. Hirono also served as a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1981 to 1994 and as Hawaii&#x27;s tenth lieutenant governor from 1994 to 2002 under Ben Cayetano. She was the Democratic nominee for governor of Hawaii in 2002, but lost to Republican Linda Lingle.

Hirono is the first elected female senator from Hawaii, the first Asian-American woman elected to the Senate, the first U.S. senator born in Japan, and the nation&#x27;s first Buddhist senator although she considers herself a non-practicing Buddhist. She is often cited with Hank Johnson as the first Buddhist to serve in the United States Congress. She is also the third woman to be elected to Congress from Hawaii (after Patsy Mink and Pat Saiki).

In 2012, Hirono was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of Daniel Akaka. Hirono won the election, defeating Lingle in a landslide, 63% to 37%. She was sworn in on January 3, 2013, by Vice President Joe Biden. Hirono was the only person of Asian ancestry serving in the U.S. Senate from 2013 until 2017, when senators Tammy Duckworth and Kamala Harris were sworn in, representing Illinois and California, respectively. Hirono is Hawaii&#x27;s junior senator, and Brian Schatz is its senior senator. She was reelected to the Senate in 2018 and won a third term against Republican nominee Bob McDermott in 2024.
==Early life and education==
Mazie Hirono was born on November 3, 1947, in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan to Laura Chie Satō, a Japanese American, and Hirono Matabe, a Japanese veteran of World War II. Mazie&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Hiroshi Satō, immigrated to Hawaii to work on a sugar plantation at the age of 16; her grandmother, Tari Shinoki, immigrated to Hawaii as a picture bride. After finding plantation work difficult, the couple opened a bathhouse on River Street in Honolulu in 1928. The couple had a daughter, Laura Chie, in 1924, and a son, Akira.

In 1939, Tari returned to Japan with the teenage Laura and Akira; Hiroshi remained in Hawaii to run the bathhouse for two more years before joining his family in 1941. Laura felt out of place in Japan as one of the many Nisei Japanese Americans who emigrated with their returning Issei parents (barred from US citizenship or land ownership) before World War II and during the Great Depression. Despite such feelings, although her brother returned to Hawaii after the war, she remained in Japan and married a veterinarian, Hirono Matabe, in 1946. Laura moved with her husband to southern Fukushima and had three children, Roy, Mazie, and Wayne. Mazie, the middle child, was the only daughter.

Mazie&#x27;s father, Matabe, was a compulsive gambler and alcoholic who pawned even his wife&#x27;s possessions for gambling money. Treated &quot;like a slave&quot; by her in-laws, Mazie&#x27;s mother finally left the abusive marriage in 1951. Laura later recounted her point of decision: &quot;My brother sent money to buy a school uniform for my son. My husband took the money, went to town, and never came back home. It was getting closer to the start of school, so I went to look for him. I found out he had ordered an overcoat for himself with the money. He didn&#x27;t need an overcoat in the spring. That&#x27;s when I made up my mind to leave.&quot; After telling her in-laws she was going to take her children to school in her hometown, Laura left the house, never to return. Selling her clothes to pay the rail fare, she and the children moved back to her parents&#x27; home. Laura said, &quot;My husband never came around once; my parents were supportive and took all of us in. My mother gave us money. I guess it all boils down to love.&quot;

The Satō-Hirono family decided to return to Hawaii, but under the U.S. quota system Tari and Hiroshi, as Japanese nationals without American citizenship or professional status, could not go with Laura, an American citizen. Thus the family was separated, with three-year-old Wayne staying behind with his grandparents and Laura returning to Honolulu alone with Mazie and Roy in March 1955. After two years of hard work, she brought her parents and youngest son to Hawaii in 1957. &quot;She determined that she had to get away [from her husband]...she wanted to put thousands of miles between them&quot;, Hirono said of her mother. &quot;That took a lot of courage. I always tell my mom there is nothing I can do—hard as it is to be in politics...harder than what she did.&quot;

After first living with Mazie&#x27;s uncle Akira, the family moved into a rooming house on Kewalo Street in Honolulu with one room, one table, three chairs, and one bed. Laura recalled, &quot;Mazie and Roy slept on the bed. I slept on the floor with a futon. The landlady was so nice. The rent was $35, but she charged us less because I didn&#x27;t have a job.&quot; Laura began working for the Hawaii Hochi as a typesetter and also three nights a week for a catering company. Mazie worked in the school cafeteria and had a paper route. Though money was tight and the family was forced to move often, Laura kept them together. Mazie recalled that she and her brother used to get a dime once or twice a week from their mother. &quot;We both had baseball piggy banks. My older brother spent all his dimes but I saved mine. But one day I came home and the dimes were gone. My mother had to use it to buy food.&quot;

Hirono never saw her father again, and he has since died. Laura became a newspaper proofreader in 1961 and retired from the Hawaii Newspaper Agency in 1986; Roy became a Hawaiian Electric supervisor. Wayne drowned in 1978, aged 26. Mazie&#x27;s grandfather Hiroshi died in 1989, and her grandmother Tari died in 2000 at age 99.

Raised in Honolulu, Hirono became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. She attended Kaahumanu Elementary and Koko Head Elementary Schools. She graduated from Kaimuki High School, which had a predominantly Japanese American student body at the time. Hirono then enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in psychology in 1970. She later attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., where she obtained her juris doctor degree in 1978. Hirono then returned to Honolulu, where she practiced law.

==Hawaii House of Representatives (1981–1994)==

===Elections===
In 1980, Hirono was elected to Hawaii&#x27;s 12th House district in a multi-member district with Democratic State Representative David Hagino. Hawaii eliminated multi-member districts, and after redistricting she ran for Hawaii&#x27;s 20th House district and won. After redistricting again in 1984, she ran successfully for the newly redrawn 32nd House District. In 1992, after redistricting, she ran one last time in the newly redrawn 22nd House district. She easily won the three-candidate Democratic primary with 91% of the vote. She won the general election and served only one term in the 22nd district before retiring in 1994 to run for statewide office.

===Tenure===
Hirono served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1981 to 1994, sponsoring many bills that became state law.

===Committee assignments===
From 1987 to 1992, she was Chair of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Committee.

==Lieutenant governor (1994–2002)==

===Elections===
====1994====
Hirono ran for lieutenant governor of Hawaii and won the Democratic primary, defeating fellow State Representative Jackie Young 65%–26%. In the general election she defeated three other candidates: Danny Kaniela Kaleikini (Best Party), State Representative Fred Hemmings (Republican Party), and Jack Morse (Green Party), 37%–31%–29%–4%.

====1998====
Hirono ran for reelection in 1998. She defeated Nancy Cook in the primary with 89% of the vote to Cook&#x27;s 11%. In the general election, Hirono defeated Republican State Senator Stan Koki, 50%–49%, a margin of only 5,254 votes.

===Tenure===
The election of the Democratic ticket was historic for both candidates. Ben Cayetano was the first Filipino American elected governor, and Hirono was the first Japanese immigrant to be elected lieutenant governor.

During her tenure as lieutenant governor, Hirono was president of the National Commission on Teaching, America&#x27;s Future, and the Hawaii Policy Group. She also spearheaded the Pre-Plus program, a first-in-the-nation comprehensive universal preschool education program.

==2002 gubernatorial election==

Hirono originally planned to run for mayor of Honolulu in a potential 2002 special election created by the vacancy of incumbent Mayor Jeremy Harris, who was planning to resign to run for governor of Hawaii. But due to internal controversies, Harris dropped out of the gubernatorial election and remained mayor for another two years. Hirono switched races.

Hirono worked to gain the support of Hawaii Democrats in her primary against former State House Majority Leader Ed Case. After polling almost equally throughout the race, Hirono defeated Case in the September 21 Democratic primary with 41% of the vote to Case&#x27;s 40%, a margin of 2,613 votes.

In the general election, Republican nominee and Maui Mayor Linda Lingle defeated Hirono 52–47%, becoming Hawaii&#x27;s first female governor.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2007–2013)==
===Elections===
====2006====
On September 23, Hirono ran to represent in the House of Representatives after incumbent Ed Case chose not to seek another term. The Democratic primary was crowded and very competitive. There were ten candidates, seven of whom served in the Hawaii Legislature. Hirono&#x27;s advantage was that she was the only candidate who had held statewide office and, as a result, had the most name recognition. She led in fundraising, helped by the endorsement of EMILY&#x27;s List. She won with a plurality of 22% of the vote. State Senator Colleen Hanabusa finished second with 21%, 845 votes short of Hirono.

In the general election Hirono defeated Republican State Senator Bob Hogue, 61%–39%.

====2008====

Hirono won reelection to a second term with 76% of the vote.

====2010====

Hirono won reelection to a third term with 72% of the vote.

===Tenure===

In 2008, the national preschool advocacy organization named Hirono &quot;Pre-K Champion&quot; for her efforts to pass pre-kindergarten legislation.

Hirono co-sponsored the Prevention First Act of 2007. The act aimed to increase public access to contraception and government funding to support the use of contraception. It places an emphasis on informing and protecting women from unintended pregnancy.
On May 4, 2011, Hirono voted against the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would have prohibited federal health care programs from covering abortion costs, with exceptions for life-threatening cases.

In July 2011, Hirono voted for the Access to Birth Control Act, which mandates that pharmacies provide birth control to customers without undue delay. The ABP Act also ensures that customers seeking birth control can obtain it without being submitted to unwanted harassment or breaches in patient confidentiality.
EMILY&#x27;s List, a Democratic pro-choice action committee, pledged support to Hirono for her history of supporting contraceptive and abortion policies during her term. The endorsement helped Hirono in her 2012 senatorial race, contributing $129,714 to her campaign.

She won the Democratic primary election on August 11, 2012. Hirono was endorsed as one of the Dean Dozen, a group of candidates chosen for their progressive values by Democracy for America, an organization founded by former Vermont governor Howard Dean. The Republican nominee was former Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle, who had defeated Hirono a decade earlier in the gubernatorial election. Hirono defeated Lingle with 63% of the vote. She is the first female senator from Hawaii, as well as the first Asian-born immigrant to be elected to the U.S. Senate. She was a part of the first completely non-Christian congressional delegation from the state, which existed until the election of Mark Takai (an Episcopalian) in 2014 as the representative for Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

In the 2012 campaign, Hirono raised $5.2 million, with approximately 52% raised from large corporations. Lingle raised $5.5 million, with 74% from large corporations. Hirono spent $5 million and Lingle $4.8 million.

===Tenure===
On December 12, 2012, the Senate Democratic Steering Committee announced that Hirono would serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would give her influence on matters ranging from approving nominations of federal judges to setting criminal justice policy.

During the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings in September 2018, Hirono was an outspoken defender of Christine Blasey Ford after Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, telling men to &quot;shut up and step up. Do the right thing for a change.&quot; She also said in an NPR interview before Kavanaugh&#x27;s confirmation hearings that she could vote to confirm him &quot;if he turns miraculously into a Sotomayor&quot;.

In the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Hirono called for the resignation of Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley for their opposition to certifying the 2020 presidential election Electoral College count. She also called for the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office.

In April 2021, Hirono sponsored a bill attempting to decrease hate crimes against Asian Americans due to xenophobia associated with COVID-19. The bill passed the Senate 94–1, with only Hawley opposing it.

==Political positions==

According to On the Issues, Hirono&#x27;s voting history places her in the &quot;left/liberal&quot; camp. The American Conservative Union gave her a 2% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.

===Abortion===
Hirono has a 100% rating from Reproductive Freedom for All (formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America). She has also been consistently endorsed by EMILY&#x27;s List, an organization that endorses women running on pro-choice platforms. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Hirono told the panel: &quot;If you don&#x27;t support abortion, don&#x27;t get one, but leave everyone else to the painful decisions they have to make along with their physicians&quot;.

Hirono called the June 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; &quot;a horrific day in America&quot;. She proclaimed, &quot;This will go down as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Court.&quot;

===Gun control===
In 2016, she participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. Hirono expressed disappointment when the Democrat-proposed Feinstein Amendment (banning the sale of firearms to individuals on the terrorist watchlist) and the Republican-backed background check expansion and alert system (regarding guns being sold to terrorist watchlist suspects) both failed to pass the Senate.

===Health care===
On July 28, 2017, two months after undergoing surgery for stage-four kidney cancer, Hirono spoke on the Senate floor and voted against the so-called &quot;skinny repeal&quot; of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). MSNBC reporter Kyle Griffin filmed Hirono&#x27;s speech and posted it on Twitter.

In January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Hirono was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the effect of the government shutdown on the public health and employees while expressing alarm &quot;that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency&#x27;s employees and the safety and security of the nation&#x27;s food and medical products.&quot;

Hirono is a supporter of Medicare for All.

=== Housing ===
In April 2019, Hirono was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to a Senate subcommittee on housing praising the Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing &quot;HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country&quot; and expressing disappointment that Trump&#x27;s budget &quot;has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.&quot; The senators hoped the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.

===LGBTQIA+ rights===
Hirono supports the right of LGBTQ+ Americans to enlist in the Armed Forces. She also supported H.R. 1681, the Every Child Deserves a Family Act, a &quot;non-discrimination&quot; bill that would have decertified any foster care or adoption agency, such as Catholic Charities, that did not accept same-sex foster parents regardless of religious beliefs.

=== Foreign policy ===
In January 2024, Hirono voted for a resolution, proposed by Bernie Sanders, to apply the human rights provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act to U.S. aid to Israel&#x27;s military. The proposal was defeated, 72 to 11.

=== Telecommunications ===
In April 2019, Hirono was one of seven senators to sponsor the Digital Equity Act of 2019, legislation establishing a $120 million grant program that would fund the creation and implementation of &quot;comprehensive digital equity plans&quot; in every state and a $120 million grant program to support projects developed by individuals and groups. The bill also gave the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) the role of evaluating and providing guidance for digital equity projects.

==Personal life==

In May 2017, Hirono was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer, which had spread to her seventh rib. The cancer was discovered in a chest X-ray in April before minor eye surgery. Hirono&#x27;s right kidney was removed on May 17, 2017, with a Cyberknife procedure to treat the rib lesion. She returned to the Senate on May 22, 2017.

As of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Hirono&#x27;s net worth was more than $4.3 million.

In 2021, Viking Press published Hirono&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Heart of Fire: An Immigrant Daughter&#x27;s Story&quot;. &quot;Marie Claire&quot; listed the book among its &quot;25 Great Memoirs to Pre-Order Now&quot;.

Also in 2021, it was announced that Hirono would receive Japan&#x27;s Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star for her &quot;significant contributions in strengthening bilateral relations and promoting legislative exchanges between Japan and the United States&quot;.

<text>R. P. Hobson, or Peter Hobson, is a Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at University College London known for his work on autism and experimental child psychology. His research leads him to conclusions concerning the origins of consciousness, summarized in a book for the general reader, The Cradle of Thought.

The core of his analysis is that human minds are the outcome of a successful series of interactions between infant and caregiver(s). In this Hobson&#x27;s research has built on foundations established by Colwyn Trevarthen from the mid-1970s onwards. Trevarthen identified distinct steps in pre-lingual infant development, Primary Intersubjectivity and Secondary Intersubjectivity, which endow the infant&#x27;s developing mind/brain with the architecture necessary for the achievement of symbolic thought.

Hobson throws further light on this basic claim by examining what occurs in cases where, for genetic or environmental reasons, infants are denied the opportunity to investigate intersubjective relationships. To achieve a rare vantage point on human development without unethical experimentation, Hobson examines cases of autism, Down syndrome, congenital blindness and extreme social deprivation (for which statistically significant numbers of orphans rescued from Nicolae Ceauşescu&#x27;s Romanian orphanages were available). The obstacles each of these circumstances placed in the way of normal infant-caregiver interaction are finely examined.

Hobson&#x27;s argument constitutes a challenge to certain flavors of sociobiology and Evolutionary Psychology, in that it traces the conception of the human mind back to a &#x27;cradle&#x27; of social interactions, without which consciousness in the full, human sense is unobtainable. On the other hand, Hobson demonstrates that a hard-wired emotional connection is crucial for an infant to start the process of intersubjective learning. The experience of having an emotion elicited by another human being, and eliciting emotional responses in others, is identified as the material out of which humans fashion their sense of self, other, object and symbol.

Hobson&#x27;s thesis is of growing interest in Philosophy of Mind and related disciplines. Edward Skidelsky suggests that Hobson fatally overlooks the fact that people with autism learn to speak (see External Links, below). Others have understood Hobson to be blaming parents for autism, a charge explicitly rejected in The Cradle of Thought.

<doc id="715561" wikidata="Q133865" url="?curid=715561" title="Changhua County">
<text>Changhua County (Mandarin Pinyin: &quot;Zhānghuà Xiàn&quot;; Wade-Giles: &quot;Chang¹-hua⁴ Hsien⁴&quot;; Hokkien POJ: &quot;Chiang-hòa-koān&quot; or &quot;Chiong-hòa-koān&quot;) is the smallest county on the main island of Taiwan by area, and the fourth smallest in the country. With a total population of 1.24 million, Changhua County is the most populous county in the Republic of China. Its capital is Changhua City and it is part of the Taichung–Changhua metropolitan area.

==History==
===Early history===
There are 32 prehistoric burial sites in Changhua that date back 5000 years. The original name of the area was &quot;Poasoa&quot; (), so-named by the local indigenous tribes. Poasoa used to be inhabited primarily by the Babuza people, who have since been mostly assimilated by the Han people.

===Qing dynasty===
Qing rule in Taiwan began in 1683, and in 1684, Taiwan Prefecture was established to administer Taiwan under Fujian Province. The prefecture consisted of three counties: , and Zhuluo. Poasoa and modern-day Changhua County were under the jurisdiction of Zhuluo, but the Changhua area was spread over three counties.

In 1723, after the Zhu Yigui rebellion, an inspector official in Taiwan requested to the Qing Emperor to designate Changhua to another county magistrate and legal warden because of the increasing population in the northern part of Zhuluo County. As a result, Changhua County was created, encompassing the area of modern Changhua County, Taichung, half of Yunlin County and three townships of Nantou County. Changhua County Hall was built in the middle of the district and is regarded as the beginning of the Changhua County establishment.

The name of Changhua, meaning &quot;manifestation of a royal civilization&quot;, is formally worded &quot;manifestation of the majestic Emperor&#x27;s civilization spread over the seas&quot;.

===Japanese rule===
During early Japanese rule, the island was subdivided into three : Taihoku, Taiwan, and Tainan. Changhua was ruled under Taiwan Ken. In 1920, after several administrative changes, Taichū Prefecture was established, covering modern-day Changhua County, Nantou County and Taichung City. By 1930, the population in Changhua already exceeded one million.

===After World War II===
After the after World War II of Taiwan on 25 December 1945, the area of the current Changhua County was established under the jurisdiction of Taichung County. On 16 August 1950 after its separation from Taichung County, Changhua County was established with Changhua City as its county seat on 1 December 1951.

==Geography==
Changhua county is located on the west coast of Taiwan, bordering Taichung City on the north separated by Dadu River, so Changhua County and Taichung City are often referred to as the Taichung–Changhua metropolitan area. Changhua County is bordered by Yunlin County to the south by the Zhuoshui River. To the east, Changhua County is separated from Nantou County and southern Taichung City by Bagua Plateau. To the west, Changhua County faces the Taiwan Strait.

The county&#x27;s total area is , being Taiwan&#x27;s smallest county. It owns a of coastline. The landscape of Changhua can be roughly divided into two parts, one being the western flat land, and the other being the Changhua Plain. This two combines measures up to 88% of Changhua county&#x27;s total area. The highest elevation in Changhua is &quot;Hen Shan&quot;, at .

==Administration==


Changhua County is divided into 2 cities, 6 urban townships and 18 rural townships. Changhua City is the seat of the county which houses the Changhua County Government and Changhua County Council. Changhua County has the highest number of urban townships of all counties in Taiwan. It also has the second highest number of rural townships after Pingtung County.

<doc id="715565" wikidata="Q273574" url="?curid=715565" title="Kelly Curtis">
<text>Kelly Lee Curtis (born June 17, 1956) is an American actress. She is known for her roles in &quot;Magic Sticks&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1991).

==Early life==
Kelly Curtis was born in Santa Monica, California, the oldest child of actors Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. Her younger sister is actress Jamie Lee Curtis. Her paternal grandparents were Hungarian-Jewish immigrants and two of her maternal great-grandparents were Danish. The rest of her mother’s ancestry is German and Scots-Irish. She has four half-siblings, from her father&#x27;s remarriages, Alexandra Curtis; Allegra Curtis; Nicholas Curtis, who died of a drug overdose; and Benjamin Curtis.

Curtis&#x27; first appearance on the silver screen was as a young girl in the United Artists action/adventure &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958) starring her parents. Her parents divorced in 1962, and her mother later married Robert Brandt.

In 1978, she graduated from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York with a degree in business. She worked briefly as a stockbroker.

==Career==
Curtis studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. An article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; of July 28, 1982, about the play &quot;Say Goodnight, Gracie&quot; reads, in part, &quot;Kelly Curtis is Ginny, sadly resigned to not being smart but smartly settled for honest responses. Here, writing and performance transcend one-note designation. Seated quietly, Curtis delivers a touching monologue that would have been the heart of another and better play, rather than a disarming moment of inspired simplicity.&quot; She played the role as Shirley in the comedy &quot;Magic Sticks&quot; (1987) and starred in the leading role as Miriam Kreisl in the horror film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1991).

On September 14, 1989, she and playwright/producer Scott Morfee (born 1954) were married. The couple were then working together on his play with music, &quot;Shout and Twist&quot;, which she was not only appearing in, but producing.

Curtis was a regular cast member in the role as Lieutenant Carolyn Plummer during the first season of the crime/action television series &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1996). Her guest appearances on TV include roles on &quot;The Renegades&quot; (1983), &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993), and &quot;Judging Amy&quot; (1999). She has worked as a production assistant on &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003), &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot; (2004), and &quot;You Again&quot; (2010).

<text>Tacna (; Aymara &amp; Quechua: Taqna) is the southernmost department and region in Peru. The Chilean Army occupied the present-day Tacna Department during the War of the Pacific from 1885 until 1929 when it was reincorporated into Peru.

==Geography==
The department of Tacna has borders with the Pacific Ocean on the west, the department of Moquegua on the north, the department of Puno on the northeast, the Bolivian La Paz Department on the east, and the Arica-Parinacota Region of Chile on the south. The border between the Tacna Region and Chile is known as &quot;La Línea de la Concordia&quot;.

The region is located below the Titicaca plateau and has a diverse geography, including volcanoes, deserts, and mountainous zones, from which arise rivers that cross over the punas and the plateaus, thus forming the hydrographical system of this zone. The region is small in size but has a significant mining and agriculture potential. It has various climates and diverse production.

===Climate===
This area has a high level of sunshine year round due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Tacna has a desert climate, abbreviated &quot;Bwh&quot; on climate maps.

==History==

===Prehistoric era===
There is evidence of the presence of a very early culture that goes back almost 10 000 years. The archaeological investigations in the region have proven that a civilization dwelt in this zone in the Stone Age. The Toquepala Caves (7630 BC) and Abrigo de Caru (6240 BC) belong to this age. There are other sites such as Girata Complex, Mullini, and Queñavichinca, where investigations have not been concluded.

===Spanish conquest===
The first groups of Spanish conquerors arrived in the region in 1535. These groups were formed by members of the Almagro expedition, organised to conquer Chile. During this time, the city of Tacna was called Villa San Pedro de Tacna. In 1615 and 1784 Tacna experienced violent earthquakes, and many towns were reduced to ruins. However, they were rebuilt in the same locations as before.

===19th century===
Tacna has a seat of honour in the emancipation process. In 1811, Francisco Antonio de Zela made the first declarations in favour of a libertarian administration from Tacna. Once the Peruvian independence struggle was well under way, the heroism of this city was honoured by the revolutionary government&#x27;s proclamation to promote it to the rank of villa in 1823. On 26 May 1828, President José de La Mar promulgated a law passed by Congress by which the city of Tacna was given the title of &quot;Ciudad Heroica&quot; (Heroic City).

The administrative divisions before the war against Chile were as follows:

During the War of the Pacific against Chile, the &quot;tacneños&quot; made contributions to the resistance of the state to the advances of the Chilean forces into the province, some giving up their lives in defence of the nation.

===Chilean administration===

On 26 May 1880, after the Battle of Alto de la Alianza, the Chilean army occupied the Tacna province. Under the terms of the treaty, Chile was to occupy the provinces of Tacna and Arica for ten years, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine the region&#x27;s sovereignty. Tacna remained under Chilean control for 50 years, during which Chilean groups and authorities led a campaign of Chilenization in an attempt to persuade the local population to abandon their Peruvian past and accept Chilean nationality.

However, Peruvian nationalists ensured that the Chilean propaganda failed and the planned plebiscite was never held. Finally, in 1929, the Treaty of Lima was signed in which Chile kept Arica, while Peru regained Tacna whilst receiving a $6 million indemnity and other concessions. From 1890 to 1929, Locumba served as the provisional capital of the area of the department not under Chilean administration.

Some of the important persons who lived in Tacna during the Chilean administration was Salvador Allende and his family; they lived in the city for eight years. Allende lived in Tacna from infancy. He arrived in 1908 and studied in the Tacna School (Liceo de Tacna).

====Maritime dispute====

On 26 January 2007, Peru&#x27;s government issued a protest against Chile’s demarcation of the coastal frontier that the two countries share. Peruvian President Alan García recalled his ambassador to Chile, Hugo Otero, to Lima to consult about the controversy over the maritime boundary the two countries share. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, the Chilean legislatures endorsed a plan regarding the Arica and Parinacota region which did not comply with the established demarcation of the border. They alleged that the proposed Chilean law included an assertion of sovereignty over 19,000 square metres of land in Peru&#x27;s Department of Tacna.

According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, Chile had defined a new region &quot;without respecting the Concordia demarcation.&quot; The Peruvian government maintained that the dispute over the Chilean plan is part of an ongoing maritime dispute whereby Chile had tried to use the demarcation process to extend its maritime frontier. Over the past 50 years, Peru has maintained claims over roughly 40,000 square kilometers of ocean territory. The Chilean government asserted that the region in dispute is not a coastal site named Concordia, but instead refers to boundary stone No. 1, which is located to the northeast and 200 meters inland.

Given that the proposed Chilean law did not recognize the borderline established by both nations in the 1929 agreement, Peru lodged diplomatic protests with Chile. In the complex territorial dispute, Chile was asserting the border near the Pacific Ocean to fit in the geographical parallel, which Lima asserted would cut off at least 19,000 squares metres of the Peruvian territory.

A possible border dispute was averted when the Chilean Constitutional Court ruled on the issue on 26 January 2007, striking down the legislation. Whilst agreeing with the court&#x27;s ruling, the Chilean government reiterated its stance that the maritime borders between the two nations were not in question and had been formally approved by the international community.

On 28 January 2007, Peru&#x27;s leading newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot; reported that the President of the Cabinet of Ministers (Consejo de Ministros del Perú), Jorge del Castillo, expressed his grave concern over the pending maritime dispute with Chile.
On 27 January 2014, in the final ruling of the International Court of Justice located in The Hague, Peru gained some maritime territory. The maritime boundary extends only to off of the coast. From that point, the new border runs in a southwesterly direction to a point that is equidistant from the coast of the two countries. Under the ruling, Chile lost control over part of its formerly claimed maritime territory and gave additional maritime territory to Peru.

From the 27 January 2014 court press release: 
==Political division==

Tacna Department is divided into four provinces (, singular: &quot;provincia&quot;), which are composed of 26 districts (&quot;distritos&quot;, singular: &quot;distrito&quot;).

===Provinces===
The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:
*Candarave (Candarave)
*Jorge Basadre (Locumba)
*Tacna (Tacna)
*Tarata (Tarata)

==Economy==

Tacna&#x27;s primary income earner is copper mining. Agriculturally, Tacna produces 53.15% of the whole olive crop in Peru. It also produces maize, potatoes, wheat, cotton, oregano, alfalfa, and grapevine (for the production of wine and pisco). It also has a sizable herd of dairy cattle and lamb.

In addition to mining and agriculture, fishing is also important, as Tacna&#x27;s offshore region is abundant in fish resources.

==Local customs==
===Typical dishes and beverages===
Tacna offers visitors colorful dishes exquisitely combined and abundantly served. The &quot;picante a la Tacneña&quot; and &quot;patazca Tacneña&quot; belong to this region. Corn and cheese, &quot;chicharrones&quot; with toasted corn, cuy, or guinea pig &quot;chactado&quot;, corn cake with peanuts and raisins, baked pork, grilled lamb, are also local specialties. To drink, Tacna has macerated Brussels apricot, &quot;frutilla&quot; or tumbo, and wines produced in the local vineyards.

===Festivities===
Carnivals. They are celebrated in different towns and villages with typical local dances that can go on for entire days and nights.

* April – the Corn and Potato Festival in Tacna.
* 26 May – the Anniversary of the Battle of Alto de la Alianza.
* 7 June – the Anniversary of the Battle of Arica.
* 20 June – Day to remember the tacneño patriot Francisco Antonio de Zela.
* 23 June – Night of San Juan.
* 28 August – &quot;Procesión de la Bandera&quot;. A civic procession act in which women of Tacna carry the red and white Peruvian flag through the streets of the city. Later, various associations, groups of students, and the armed and police forces take part in a parade that ends in the main square, where the Arch of the Heroes is located. It is part of a week that celebrates the reincorporation of Tacna into Peruvian territory. Simultaneously, a fair for farm and livestock products, industrial goods, and handicrafts takes place.

<text>Samuel L. Greitzer (August 10, 1905 – February 22, 1988) was an American mathematician, the founding chairman of the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, and the publisher of the precollege mathematics journal &quot;Arbelos&quot;. Together with H.S.M. Coxeter in 1967, Greitzer coauthored the well-received textbook &quot;Geometry Revisited&quot;, which has remained in print for more than 40 years.

==Biography==
Born in the Russian Empire, Greitzer moved to the United States in 1906, graduated from Stuyvesant High School, received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1927 from City College of New York, and later earned a Ph.D. from Yeshiva University. He held academic positions at Yeshiva University, Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, Columbia University, and Rutgers University. In the 1970s, he directed a National Science Foundation summer program at Rutgers for high-ability high-school math students.

<text>Ptolemy (, &quot;Ptolemaios&quot;) is a male given name, derived from Ancient Greek and meaning &#x27;warlike&#x27;. It is formed from the Epic Greek &quot;ptolemos&quot; meaning &#x27;war&#x27;. The name was used throughout the Greek world, but was particularly popular in ancient Macedon and its nobility. During the Hellenistic period, Ptolemy I Soter, a general of Alexander the Great, founded the Ptolemaic dynasty which ruled their Kingdom in Ancient Egypt. All male rulers of the dynasty bore the name &#x27;Ptolemy&#x27;, the last being Ptolemy XII Auletes, father of Cleopatra. Common variants include Ptolemaeus (Latin), Tolomeo (Italian) and Talmai (Hebrew).

==Etymology==
&quot;Ptolemy&quot; is the English form of the Ancient Greek name (&quot;Ptolemaios&quot;), a derivative of , an Epic form of &#x27;war&#x27; and the suffix &quot;-aios&quot; meaning &#x27;pertaining&#x27; or &#x27;belonging to&#x27;. A nephew of Antigonus I Monophthalmus was called &quot;Polemaeus&quot;, the normal form of the adjective. &quot;Ptolemaios&quot; is first attested in Homer&#x27;s Iliad and is the name of an Achaean warrior, son of Piraeus, father of Eurymedon.

The name &quot;Ptolemaios&quot; varied over the years from its roots in ancient Greece, appearing in different languages in various forms and spellings: 
* 
* 
* 
* &quot;Ptolemaios&quot;
* Phoenician: 𐤐𐤕𐤋𐤌𐤉𐤎 (ptlmys) or 𐤐𐤕𐤋𐤌𐤉𐤔 (ptlmyš)
* Hebrew and Aramaic: תלמי (tlmy) &quot;&quot;
* Middle Persian 𐭯𐭲𐭫𐭬𐭥𐭱 (ptlmywš) &quot;Patlamyōš&quot;
* &quot;Baṭlamīūs/ Ptolemaios&quot;
* &quot;Baṭulīmūs&quot;
The name &quot;Ptolemy&quot; spread from its Greek origins to enter other languages in Western Asia during the Hellenisation that followed the conquest of the known world by Alexander the Great.
The Aramaic name &quot;Bar-Talmai&quot; &#x27;son of Talmai&#x27; (Greek &quot;Bartolomaios&quot;, English Bartholomew) may be related (Bartholomew the Apostle is thus thought to have been the son of a Ptolemy.)³

Ptolemais is formed from this name by the Greek feminine adjectival ending &quot;-i(d)s&quot;.

<doc id="715597" wikidata="Q209597" url="?curid=715597" title="Department of Tumbes">
<text>Tumbes () is a coastal department and region in northwestern Peru bordering Ecuador. Due to the region&#x27;s location near the Equator it has a warm climate, with beaches that are considered among the finest in Peru. Despite its small area, the region contains a wide variety of ecosystems. It is the smallest department in Peru and its third least populous department after Moquegua and Madre de Dios, but it is also its third most densely populated department, after La Libertad and Lambayeque.

The name &quot;Tumbes&quot; originates from either &quot;Tumpis&quot;, a group of native peoples from the area, the word &quot;tumbos&quot;, a species of Passiflora that used to abound in the area, or the name of the Tumba cacique, whose son founded and populated the area.

==Geography==

The Tumbes Region is bordered by the Ecuadorian provinces of El Oro and Loja on the east; Peru&#x27;s Piura Region on the south; and by the Pacific Ocean on the north and west.

Morphologically, four zones can be defined in the region: the delta of the Tumbes and Zarumilla rivers; an alluvial plain north of the Tumbes River, with dry, low-depth ravines; ancient terraces that have been strongly eroded in the Máncora area; and the Amotape mountain range in the east and south, ending at El Barco Mountain. The delta of the Tumbes river is shallow, and when the tide is low, little sandy keys show up, which get covered by mangrove vegetation. 

Despite its small area— it is the second-smallest region in Peru— Tumbes has a great variety of ecosystems: mangroves, Tumbes–Piura dry forests, the only coastal tropical forests in Peru, and a rich and warm sea.

* Contralmirante Villar (Zorritos)
* Tumbes (Tumbes)
* Zarumilla (Zarumilla)

==History==

Tumbes was a populated region well before the Inca Empire. The first settlers were fishers and hunters. Most recent cultures that lived there have left evidence of the refinement in their ceramics, and &quot;huacas&quot; or ruins that still stand today.

Tumbes was integrated into the Inca Empire during the reign of Sapa Inca Pachacuti. He introduced a new way of organizing the empire, but the task of integration continued during Tupac Inca Yupanqui&#x27;s and Huayna Capac&#x27;s reigns. He made it a key departure point for his campaign to conquer the Cañaris.

The adventure of the Spanish &quot;Conquistadores&quot; had its beginning in Tumbes: at Puerto Pizarro Francisco Pizarro and his men landed in search of gold. The conquerors set off to the rest of the empire, founding cities and overpowering their people.

During colonial times, Tumbes was no more than a crossing point where soldiers and adventurers stopped momentarily to restock themselves, and continue traveling. Tumbes, however, gained permanent importance after Peru&#x27;s independence; with Ecuador&#x27;s long-standing territorial claims over the Loreto Region of Peru, Tumbes&#x27;s closeness to the border exposed it as a resistance point in some episodes of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian War.

As part of the decentralization process in Peru, a referendum was held on October 30, 2005, to decide whether the region would merge with the regions of Piura and Lambayeque to create the new Northern Region (). However, voters in the region voted against the merger.

==Attractions==
===Touristic sites===
The fact that Tumbes lies so close to the Equator has determined its landscape, which teems in plant life. The beaches of Tumbes and its warm sea are ideal for surfing and scuba diving. Its pure white sands, sun and warm weather all year long, and a sea ideal for water sports, make the beach of Punta Sal one of the finest on the Peruvian coast. North of the city of Tumbes lies Puerto Pizarro, the gateway to the National Mangroves Sanctuary. The mangroves have formed vast clumps of saltwater-tolerant coastal forests which have created a unique ecosystem linking the river and the sea. The mangroves are the breeding grounds for black scallops, which are served up in Tumbes&#x27; most famous dish, the black scallop ceviche.

South of Tumbes lies Zorritos, the town which received its name from workers involved in drilling the first oilwell in the area, back in 1863. Not far from Zorritos lies the Bocapán beach, where visitors can swim in Hervideros, natural hot springs bubbling with iodized salts.

===Typical dishes and beverages===
The typical dishes of the &quot;Tumbesino&quot; cuisine are based on seafood— ceviche of black scallops, crab, or shrimps, or &quot;cebiche mixto&quot;— and Tumbiresas covered by yucca and banana balls broth with &quot;dominicos&quot;, meat, red peppers, eggs, olives, raisins, flour, coriander and other herbs.

Other specialties include the shrimp omelette, &quot;chupe de cangrejos&quot;, and crabmeat omelette.

A typical beverage in the region is the &quot;chinguirito&quot;, which is obtained by combining &quot;pipa&quot; (the milk of a soft coconut) with the famous grape brandy called pisco.

Kadono was born in Tokyo, Japan. As a child during the World War II, she was evacuated to North Japan. She attended and graduated with a degree in English literature from Waseda University. After graduation in 1960 at the age of 25, she emigrated to Brazil where she spent two years. She wrote a non-fiction story called &quot;Brazil and My Friend Luizinho&quot; (Ruijinnyo shōnen, Burajiru o tazunete), based on her experience at that time, about a Brazilian boy who loves dancing samba. &quot;Brazil&quot; was released in 1970. Kadono stated that living through World War II sparked her rebellious nature and had a profound impact on the way she viewed the world.

She has published almost two hundred works, mainly books for children, including picture books and prose works for older children, as well as essay collections. Her first successful children&#x27;s book, published &quot;Ôdorabô Bula Bula shi&quot; (&quot;The Robber Bla-Bla&quot;), was published in 1981. In 1985, she published the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Majo no Takkyūbin&quot; (魔女の宅急便, &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;), about a young witch-in-training who starts a delivery service in a seaside town of Koriko. The book received several awards, including the Noma Prize for Children&#x27;s Literature, the Shogakukan Children&#x27;s Publication Culture Award, and the IBBY Honor List. It was adapted into a film by Hayao Miyazaki in 1989 and became one of his most popular films. The book was also adapted into a live-action film in 2014, directed by Takashi Shimizu. She has written eight sequels and prequels to &quot;Kiki″s&quot;.

<text>Caspar Bartholin the Elder (; 12 February 1585 – 13 July 1629) was a Danish physician, scientist and theologian.

==Biography==
Caspar Berthelsen Bartholin was born in Malmø, Denmark (modern Sweden). His precocity was extraordinary; at three years of age he was able to read, and in his thirteenth year he composed Greek and Latin orations and delivered them in public. When he was about eighteen, he went to the University of Copenhagen and afterwards studied at Rostock and Wittenberg.

Bartholin then travelled through Germany, the Netherlands, England, France and Italy, and was received with marked respect at the different universities he visited. In 1613, he was chosen professor of medicine in the University of Copenhagen and filled that office for eleven years, when, falling into a dangerous illness, he made a vow that if he should recover he would apply himself solely to the study of divinity.
He later taught theology at the university and was a canon of Roskilde.

His work, &quot;Anatomicae Institutiones Corporis Humani&quot; (1611) was for many years a standard textbook on the subject of anatomy. He was the first to describe the workings of the olfactory nerve.

==Personal life==
Bartholin was married to Anna Fincke, daughter of the mathematician Thomas Fincke.
His sons, Bertel Bartholin (1614–1690), Thomas Bartholin (1616–1680) and Rasmus Bartholin (1625–1698) were also scholars.
His grandson Caspar Bartholin the Younger (1655–1738) was an anatomist. 
He died on 13 July 1629 at Sorø in Zealand.

<text>Ptolemy the Gnostic, (Greek: &quot;Πτολεμαίος ο Γνωστικός&quot; Latin: &quot;Ptolemaeus Gnosticus&quot;) was a disciple of the Gnostic teacher Valentinius and is known for the &quot;Letter to Flora&quot;, an epistle he wrote to a wealthy woman named Flora, herself not a Gnostic.

==Biography==
Ptolemy was probably still alive 180. No other certain details are known about his life; Harnack&#x27;s suggestion that he was identical with the Ptolemy spoken of by Justin Martyr is as yet unproved. It is not known when Ptolemy became a disciple of Valentinius, but Valentinius was active in the Egyptian city of Alexandria and in Rome. Ptolemy was, with Heracleon, the principal writer of the Italian or Western school of Valentinian Gnosticism, which was active in Italy and Southern Gaul.

==Works==

Ptolemy&#x27;s works have reached us in an incomplete form in a fragment of an exegetical writing preserved by Irenæus; as well as an epistle to Flora, a Christian lady not otherwise known to us.

The epistle was found in the works of Epiphanius. It was written in response to Flora&#x27;s inquiry concerning the origin of the Ten Commandments contained in the Old Testament. Those laws, Ptolemy states, cannot be attributed to the Supreme God, nor to the devil; indeed, the set of laws does not even proceed from a single law-giver. A part of it is the work of an inferior god, analogous to the gnostic demiurge; the second part is attributable to Moses, and the third part to the elders of the Jewish people.

This demiurge occupies a middle position between the Supreme God and the devil, and is the creator of the material universe; he is neither perfect nor the author of evil, but ought to be called &#x27;just&#x27; and benevolent to the extent of his abilities. In his cosmogonic depiction of the universe, Ptolemy referred also to an extensive system of aeons that emanated from a monadic spiritual source. Thirty of these, he believed, ruled the higher world, the &quot;pleroma&quot;. This system became the basis of an exegesis which expounds the first Ogdoad of the Pleroma based on the prologue of John&#x27;s gospel.

In addition, Ptolemy subdivides the part of the Decalogue ascribed to the inferior god into three further sections: 

* The absolutely pure legislation of the Decalogue which was not destroyed but fulfilled by the Saviour.
* The laws mixed with evil, including the right of retaliation, which were abolished by the Saviour because they were incompatible with His nature.
* The section which is typical and symbolical of the higher world. This part of the Decalogue includes such precepts as circumcision and fasting and was raised by the saviour from a sensible to a spiritual plane.

<text>The [[Nokia]] 6230 is a mobile phone based on the Nokia Series 40 platform. It was announced on 28 October 2003 and released in February 2004.

Designed with business users in mind, the 6230 comes with a VGA resolution digital camera, video camera, a music player and expandable memory.

Cingular Wireless was the primary GSM carrier that offered the Nokia 6230b in the United States. Other companies such as Cincinnati Bell, Simmetry Communications, Viaero Wireless, and Telcel also offered this model.

==Features==
It features a 16-bit TFT color screen with a resolution of 128×128 pixels, a VGA camera capable of recording video clips in H.263 (SubQCIF) format at 128×96 pixels and 15 FPS. The phone is equipped with built-in Bluetooth wireless technology, an FM radio (which requires a wired headset attached to the Pop-Port interface to act as an antenna), and supports playback of 3GP video/audio at up to 30 FPS, as well as MP3, AAC and AMR audio formats. Additionally, it is EGPRS (EDGE) capable, offering speeds up to 220 kbit/s. The phone also features changeable Xpress-on covers, which are available for purchase.

It uses an Extended Li-Ion Battery of 850 mAh. The 6230 accepts MMC memory cards up to 4  GB in capacity formatted in FAT32 or FAT16 file systems (supported by later firmware releases) on which multimedia files and data can be stored. SD cards are not supported. It operates on either GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz (Nokia 6230 RH-12), or GSM 850/1800/1900 MHz (Nokia 6230b RH-28) for the North American market.

It was the first non-smartphone from Nokia with an expandable memory card slot and was usually supplied with a 32 MB MMC Card. The first non-smartphone with expandable memory was the Siemens SL45, introduced in 2001.

==Nokia 6230i==
On February 28, 2005, Nokia released an updated 6230i model (RM-72) which includes a 1.3-megapixel camera instead of a 0.3, 208×208 screen resolution (65,536 colours), a slightly larger display (1.7 inches), a raised selection button in the midst of the scroll key, and a modern redesigned menu.

It is also standard UMS (USB mass storage device class) compliant, i.e. no proprietary drivers are required to transfer data to and from the device&#x27;s memory card. It weighs 99 g (including battery BL-5C) and the dimensions are 103  mm x 44  mm x 20  mm, 76 cc.

The BL-5C battery that comes standard with it will last about 150–300 hours, depending on usage.

This model was available only in GSM 900/1800/1900  MHz; Nokia did not release an 850  MHz version for the North American market.

The next model in the 623x series is the 3G GSM/WCDMA Nokia 6233.

===Appearance===
The graphical user interface was overhauled, and many of the icons featured on the 6230i are the same as those now used uniformly across almost all new Nokia phones. Notably, the menu icons on the Nokia 6230i are animated, as opposed to the previous model which was static.

The phone has seven built-in themes (&#x27;Basic&#x27;, &#x27;Circle&#x27;, &#x27;DotSpace&#x27;, &#x27;Dots2&#x27;, &#x27;Microdots&#x27;, &#x27;Waves&#x27;, and &#x27;Window&#x27;), and users can download more. In addition, users may customise the colour of the borders, and the battery and signal bars.

The operating system does run more slowly than on the 6230, possibly due to the increased processor drain of the higher-resolution screen. Nokia also removed several options from menus, such as brightness control, and the ability to automatically overwrite text messages in the Inbox/Sent Folders. These changes have brought widespread complaints.

===Security===
The phone can automatically lock after a set time, starting from five seconds of no activity. In addition to the auto-lock, users can lock with a &#x27;keyguard&#x27;, which prevents unauthorised use of the phone. The code it uses is the standard security code. If the user gets this code wrong five times, the phone is &#x27;locked out&#x27;, whereby no one can gain access for five minutes.

Users can choose to protect their phone by enabling a PIN. When enabled, the phone will prompt users to type the PIN, and on success, the phone will grant access. Users can also protect their SIM card, which is standard phone practice.

===Organization===
The Nokia 6230i has organizing software, such as a calendar, alarm clock, to-do list, notes, and wallet. The &#x27;Wallet&#x27; is a password-protected area where users can store bank card details, tickets, receipts, and personal notes. Users can set different profiles within the &#x27;Wallet&#x27;, for example &#x27;work&#x27; or &#x27;personal&#x27;, whereby different card details, for example, can be stored. There is an e-mail application, but it must be set up by the user&#x27;s mobile phone network.

===Phone book===
Further to storing mobile numbers, users can add e-mail addresses, home phone numbers, an image (shows when a contact calls), PTT addresses, postal addresses, web addresses, notes, and user identification.

Contacts can be put into groups, for example, &#x27;work colleagues&#x27; but such groups do not appear to be usable for text messaging. There is a Distribution List feature under Messages where users can send group SMS (Only available with the 6210).

Users can add sixteen voice commands (also known as &#x27;Voice tags&#x27;), whereby users can say a contact&#x27;s name and the phone will automatically call that contact (only if the user individually sets a voice per person).

===Connectivity===
The Nokia 6230i is GPRS enabled. It features a GPRS Class 10 connectivity at up to 48 kbit/s. It is also EDGE enabled at Class 10 offering speeds up to 236.8 kbit/s. It also has an infrared port and is Bluetooth enabled, making it one of the few phones to feature both infrared and Bluetooth.

===Media===

The Nokia 6230i features an integrated music player which can play MP3 and AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) format files. The music player has an inbuilt Graphic Equalizer and the ability to create and save custom equalizers. Up to seven different equalizer settings are available. The phone plays exceptionally high-quality audio. The Music Players also includes the ability to play music via Bluetooth. It included the song &quot;Strange Transmissions&quot; by Norah Jones and the Peter Malick Group. It also includes a Media Player to play video files in 3GP formats. The video recording is done in 3GP format as well. The phone also includes a Radio (headset is required to be connected) in which 20 radio channels can be saved. Auto tuning of frequencies can be done automatically. The Nokia 6230i also features a Voice Recorder with up to 60 minutes of voice recording.

===Push to talk (PTT)===
The Nokia 6230i features Push to talk (PTT). Push-to-talk (PTT) functions as a two-way radio. The PTT option is available only if enabled by the service provider.

===Extra applications===
The phone also has a basic calculator, countdown timer, and a stopwatch, which has two settings: &#x27;Split timing&#x27; and &#x27;Lap timing&#x27;, both allow users to save and name their times. It also includes an integrated &quot;Message counter&quot; which counts the number of messages sent and received. Another application called &quot;GPRS data counter&quot; shows the data received and sent during each session and also for all sessions combined. &quot;GPRS connection timer&quot; registers the time for each session. The phone also supports speed dials, up to nine numbers can be assigned for speed dialling.

===Collection folder===
Users can download new applications (through WAP) which are stored in a folder named &#x27;Collections&#x27;. However, Nokia included three applications. &#x27;World Clock II&#x27; allows users to view time zones across the world; the graphical user interface highlights the current time zone yellow, and allows users to navigate, left or right, across the world, showing the city at the centre of the time zone. &#x27;Converter II&#x27; is an excellent application for converting anything from currencies, grams, pounds, and so forth. Through the &#x27;Options&#x27;, users can customise the conversions to suit their needs; this is especially useful when currencies alter in value. The final application is a translation tool (&#x27;Translator&#x27;). For example, if a search query is &#x27;help&#x27;, then the application will show five translations (English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian). The problem is that the phone is limited to 2 MB of applications regardless of the size of the Multimedia Card or the internal memory.

===Bugs===
A few bugs have been reported with this phone:

*When using a Bluetooth audio device together with voice tags, the ringing tone is always ascending, even when ascending is not selected. The only temporary solution is to reset the phone, although the problem comes back when using Bluetooth and voice tags again. This bug is still present in the latest firmware.
*Sometimes, the display lights up for a few seconds and then goes out again. This happens when the phone battery depletes by one &quot;bar&quot;, which may be seen as pointless as the lights coming on would increase the drain on the battery. This was meant to be an early warning for low battery.
*Sometimes, for no apparent reason, an image or video clip is copied.
*In the music player, when selecting an entry in the playlist at a position higher than 255 the player has a wrap-around bug and will play the entry 255 positions before the one selected. For example, if entry 260 is selected entry 5 will be played, if entry 300 is selected entry 45 will be played. This is caused by the music player using an unsigned 8-bit integer to store the selected track. This bug is present on the 6230, 6230i and early versions of the 6233. The workaround is to use the playlist to see the entry number, then go back to the currently playing entry and type in the number of the entry you want (jump to).
*On the newer firmware version of the 6230i, the camera is unable to process images that are bigger than 786  KB. This can be experienced when taking pictures at top quality settings in 1280x1024 mode of scenes with lots of fine details, like the leaves on a tree. You will sometimes get a message like &quot;Unable to save&quot; because the image processor in the camera module does not have enough memory to create the compressed JPEG file from the image sensor data.
*While the 6230i is able to use a 4  GB MMC card (provided it is formatted with FAT16) it will fail to enter mass storage mode when a 4 GB MMC is present.
*On older versions of the BL-5C battery, the internal chemicals would leak/react while charging for long periods of time. While this is rare, Nokia offered a free replacement.
*When the phone is left on for extended periods, the ringer volume is set to low, regardless of the setting.

==Reception==
British review site &quot;S21&quot; gave the phone 3 stars out of 5. It said that the phone is highly recommended and a &quot;significant improvement&quot; over the Nokia 6220, but criticised its poor quality screen.

<text>Alto Paraguay (; &quot;Upper Paraguay&quot;) is the least populous as well as a sparsely populated department of Paraguay. The capital is the town of Fuerte Olimpo.

In 1992, the Chaco Department was merged with Alto Paraguay.

==Nature and national parks==
Alto Paraguay contains many natural resources, so is home to several national parks, each with different characteristics. The Defensores del Chaco National Park is the largest in the Paraguayan territory and holds the hill Cerro León, the highest point in northern Paraguay. The dry terrain optimally grows various species of cactus. Parque Nacional Río Negro is an area with several small lakes and most of the department&#x27;s fauna. In the dry regions are Parque Nacional Coronel Cabrera and Parque Nacional Chovoreca.

==Agriculture, livestock and deforestation==
Paraguay&#x27;s largest reserves of undeveloped fertile forest and lowest land prices are found in Alto Paraguay. Agriculture and cattle farming have started to make inroads. The fertility of the Chaco&#x27;s deep sedimentary soils is generally high, except in the westernmost parts, where there are very sandy soils, and in the eastern plain where there are some seasonal wetlands. Annual rainfall is sufficient in the east (around 1200 mm), fair in the center (around 900 mm) and scarce in the west (around 700 mm). A lack of infrastructure and roads is the primary limitation for farmers in the area.

Current agricultural expansion comes at the expense of the area&#x27;s native forests. During the two decades between 1990 and 2010, Paraguay had one of the highest deforestation rates worldwide. The World Land Trust estimated 2008 deforestation in the Paraguay Chaco was over 200,000 hectares.
The department&#x27;s most important activity is cattle ranching, extensive in the savannas of the east and intensive on the planted pastures of cleared land. Cultivation of sorghum, sugar cane and (in planning stage as of January 2009, for the arid west) jatropha are very recent developments.

==Districts==
The department is divided into five districts:
# Bahía Negra
# Capitán Carmelo Peralta
# Fuerte Olimpo
# Puerto Casado

<text>Alto Paraná (; &quot;Upper Paraná&quot;) is a department in Paraguay. The capital is Ciudad del Este (formerly known as Puerto Presidente Stroessner, originally Puerto Flor de Lis).

The Alto Paraná department has experienced tremendous economic and population growth in the past 50 years. Most of this growth has been concentrated in the department capital of Ciudad del Este, and mainly occurred after the construction of the Puente de la Amistad bridge in 1961, which connects Paraguay and Brazil. This department is home to the Itaipu power plant, which supplies 95% of the energy consumed by Paraguay, and the Acaray Dam. Several ecological reserves, a zoo and the Taiwanese-Paraguayan Technology Park are situated in this department.

The city of Presidente Franco was the first city founded in this department. Several important agricultural establishments are centered in the region of Minga Guazú which is home of the Guarani International Airport.

== History ==

In colonial times, there were several settlements established in this area. The most important of these being Ontiveros, Ciudad Real, and Villa Rica del Espíritu Santo. Nevertheless, these villages did not initially prosper due to the constant attacks of the Bandeirantes.

By the end of the 17th century and beginnings of the 18th century, many populations settled in this area due to the promising logging economy. These urban centers organized around military bases that served to defend them against the attacks of the Bandeirantes. Some of these cities exist into the present day, such as: Villa Curuguaty, Ygatimi, Caaguazú, Lima and Ajos.

After the War against the Triple Alliance, these lands were sold, creating large states in which the most important economic activities were the exploitation of the local forests and the cultivation of yerba mate. During the War Against the Triple Alliance many of the men of Paraguay died, and to make up for population loss, European/Middle Eastern and East Asian men immigrated to the nation. In this region, many descendants of Poles, Ukrainians, and Japanese people are found demographically similar to the neighboring Brazilian state of Paraná. There was also settlement of Brazilian from the South of Brazil, most of the people were white Brazilians of Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Eastern European, Arabic blood. And Also Japanese Brazilians and Brazilians of mixed race.

By the end of the 19th century, it was a very active port known as Tacurú Pucú, which means &quot;high termite mound&quot;. This port was used for the transport of lumber, through the Paraná River, to Encarnación, and from Encarnación to facilitate the trade of food and textiles.
After the TRI

The department, as it is today, was created in 1945.

In 1990, the department&#x27;s structure was officially established.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

This department is located in the Oriental Region of Paraguay, between parallels 24° 30′ and 26° 15′ of latitude south and between the meridians 54° 20′ and 55° 20′ of longitude west.

It is located in the Center East of Oriental Region. It is bordered by:

* To the North: with Canindeyú Department
* To the South: with Itapúa Department
* To the East: with Brazil and Argentina
* To the West: with Caaguazú and Caazapá departments

The capital is Ciudad del Este, originally named Puerto Flor de Lis, and later Puerto Presidente Stroessner until it was renamed once more following the end of the dictatorial government of General Alfredo Stroessner. It is within the limits of the Brazilian city, Foz do Iguaçu.

=== Districts ===

The department is divided into 22 districts:


* The districts of Doctor Raúl Peña and Tavapy were created after the 2002 Census, and therefore not displayed on the map.

Alto Paraná has a combination of valleys and streams that come from the Paraná River. It also has mountainous areas of high elevation that can reach 300 meters above sea level.

The lands near the banks of the Paraná River have forests, which are threatened in the present by indiscriminate deforestation. There are local efforts to combat this through the introduction of reforestation programs, with managed planting of different species of pine.

=== Hydrography ===

The Paraná River is the most important supply of water for the department. The following are branches of this river:

* Itambey
* Ñacunday
* Limoy
* Itabo Guazú
* Pira Pyta
* Ycua Guazú
* Acaray
* Monday
* Yacuy

In this area, there are also several streams that help make the land fertile for agriculture.

These streams and rivers part due to the presence of large rocks that give origin to local waterfalls. Among these are the ones formed by the Monday and Ñacunday Rivers.

The flow of the rivers Paraná and Acaray has been used in favor of constructing the hydroelectric power stations in Itaipú and Acaray.

=== Climate ===

Alto Paraná presents an absolute maximum temperature in summer of . The absolute minimum in winter is . The annual average is .

The department receives abundant precipitation during the entire year, registered as annually. This total is the highest anywhere in Paraguay. Consequently, this area has a lot of humidity in the environment, which is good for agriculture.

Fog and light rains are the norm in wintertime.

== Economy ==

The logging industry remains to be the most important activity in the area. Nowadays, the population is also involved in the industrial process of different varieties of wood, such as: cedar, yvyra pyta, lapacho, taperyva guasu, petereby, guatambu, incense, guaica and others. Another important activity is the plantation of pine as a form of reforestation. There&#x27;s also the clearing of palm hearts.

<text>The Royal Hospital Chelsea is an Old Soldiers&#x27; retirement home and nursing home for some 300 veterans of the British Army. Founded as an almshouse — the ancient sense of the word &quot;hospital&quot; — by King Charles II in 1682, it is a site located on Royal Hospital Road in Chelsea, London. It is an independent charity and relies partly upon donations to cover day-to-day running costs to provide care and accommodation for veterans.

Residents are known as Chelsea Pensioners. The gardens of the Royal Hospital are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==

King Charles II founded the Royal Hospital as a retreat for veterans in 1682. The initiative is said to have come from Nell Gwyn according to Peter Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Nell Gwyn&quot; [1851]. The tradition was perpetuated when her portrait was used as a sign for a public house in Grosvenor Row (a thoroughfare which disappeared in the 19th century). The provision of a hostel rather than the payment of pensions was inspired by Les Invalides in Paris. The site for the Royal Hospital was an area of Chelsea, London which held an incomplete building &quot;Chelsey College&quot;, a theological college James I founded in 1609.
The precursor to the foundation was the establishment in 1677 of pensions for &quot;Reformed Officers (i.e. officers of disbanded regiments) and maimed soldiers&quot;. The main inspirational force behind the foundation of the hospital was Sir Stephen Fox (1627–1716), Paymaster of the Forces and a trusted and able royal administrator of the King, and in 1681 Fox and the king initiated plans for a permanent hospital for disabled soldiers. Letters patent were issued on 22 December 1681 notifying the king&#x27;s intention of building &quot;an hospital for the relief of such land soldiers as are, or shall be, old, lame, or infirm in ye service of the crowne&quot;. For this purpose he appointed as &quot;Receiver General and Treasurer of the moneys raised for the erection and maintenance of the hospital&quot; Nicholas Johnson (d.1682), Fox&#x27;s brother-in-law and successor as Paymaster of the Forces. The office of &quot;Receiver or Paymaster and Treasurer&quot; was held by all subsequent Paymaster of the Forces until the latter office was abolished in 1836. Fox himself, the &quot;richest commoner in the three kingdoms&quot;, donated £13,000 towards the new hospital ().

The Royal Hospital opened its doors to the Chelsea Pensioners in 1692 for &quot;the relief and succour&quot; of veterans. Some of the first soldiers admitted included those injured at the Battle of Sedgemoor. Wren expanded his original design to add two additional quadrangles to the east and west of the central court; these were known respectively as the &quot;Light Horse Court&quot; and the &quot;College Court&quot;. Due to mismanagement by Lord Ranelagh, the Hospital Treasurer, the building was not completed until 1692.


Sir John Soane, who was clerk of works in the early part of the 19th century, designed and constructed a new infirmary building which was located to the west of the main building on the site of the current National Army Museum and was destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. It was replaced by a modern infirmary which was located to the east of the main building and opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1961.

The 1960s infirmary was demolished to make way for the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary which was designed by Sir Quinlan Terry and was completed in 2008, providing a state-of-the-art care home.
In 2002, the sovereign&#x27;s mace was presented to the hospital – up until then, the hospital had had no colours or distinctive device – the mace is now carried at all the ceremonial events at the hospital. The mace was designed by Charles Webb and Aubrey Bowden and was made by Master Goldsmith Norman Bassant. The bowl of the mace is decorated with acorns and is surmounted by the St Edward&#x27;s Crown.

In March 2009, the first women in the hospital&#x27;s 317-year history were admitted as In-Pensioners. Winifred Phillips and Dorothy Hughes were the first. Winifred Phillips trained as a nurse and later joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1948 before enlisting in the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps in 1949 while serving in Egypt. After 22 years of service she retired with the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2.

Dorothy Hughes had joined the British Army in 1941 aged 18, later working as part of 450 Heavy Anti Aircraft Battery in the London Division. In 1945 the Battery was deployed near Dover to defend against V1 flying bomb attacks. She retired with the rank of Sergeant.

===Uniform===

Chelsea Pensioners are entitled to come and go from the Royal Hospital as they please, and are permitted to wear civilian clothing wherever they travel. However, within the hospital, and in the surrounding area, pensioners are encouraged to wear a blue uniform (known fondly as &quot;blues&quot;). If they travel farther from the Royal Hospital they should wear the distinctive scarlet coats instead of the blue uniform. The scarlet coats are also worn for ceremonial occasions, accompanied by tricorne hats. (At other times a peaked shako is worn.)

In uniform, the pensioners wear their medal ribbons and the insignia of rank they reached while serving in the military. They may also wear other insignia they earned during their service and many pensioners now wear parachute jump wings and even SAS jump wings. Contrary to popular belief, it is not illegal to impersonate a Chelsea pensioner; the myth probably dates from a ruling, repealed by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 2008, regarding the fraud of taking an unearned pension.

There is a legend that Nell Gwynne, Charles II&#x27;s mistress, suggested red coats for the Chelsea Pensioners because she remembered the pensioners of Coningsby Hospital in Hereford (her reputed birth town) wore coats of the same colour.

===Founder&#x27;s Day===

The Royal Hospital Founder&#x27;s Day takes place close to 29 May each year – the birthday of Charles II of England, and the date of his restoration as King in 1660. It is also known as Oak Apple Day, as it commemorates the escape of the future King following his defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, when he hid in the Royal Oak to avoid capture by Parliamentary forces. On Founder&#x27;s Day, in-pensioners of the Royal Hospital are reviewed by a member of the British Royal Family.

===Statue of King Charles II===
The 7&#x27; 6&quot; (229 cm) statue of King Charles II which stands in the central court (the Figure Court) of the hospital was cast in copper alloy by Grinling Gibbons; it was originally gilded but was bronzed in 1787. In 2002, the statue was regilded to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Golden Jubilee.

===Chapel===

The hospital&#x27;s chapel was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and is a fine and rare example of Wren&#x27;s pure ecclesiastical work: it rises high and was completed in 1687. The chapel contains a fine painting of the Resurrection in the half dome of the apse, painted by Sebastiano Ricci and his nephew Marco (who assisted with the painting at the Royal Hospital) and dates from the end of Queen Anne&#x27;s reign. The chapel was consecrated in August 1691, and services were formerly held twice daily. Nowadays services are confined to Sunday mornings and special military occasions.

===Great Hall===

The Great Hall was also designed by Sir Christopher Wren and was originally intended as a dining hall, furnished with 16 long tables, one for each original Long Ward. It contains a large mural painting from around 1690, which depicts Charles II of England on horseback being crowned by the winged figure of Victory, with the Royal Hospital Buildings behind.

Just before 1800 the pensioners started dining in the wards and the hall was then used for recreational purposes. It was here that the Duke of Wellington lay in state in 1852 and the table on which his coffin rested is just inside the entrance. The hall reverted to its original use as a dining hall in 1955.

===State Apartments===

The heavily moulded ceiling displaying James II&#x27;s cypher is by John Grove, the wainscoting is by William Cleere and the fine lime-wood carving over the fireplace is by William Emmett. The room was completed between 1685 and 1688. It was fully roofed in 1685 days before Charles II died. Within the State Apartments is also an Ante-Chamber. Both the Council Chamber and Ante-Chamber can be hired for private functions and weddings.

===Margaret Thatcher Infirmary===
The Margaret Thatcher Infirmary houses around 100 Chelsea Pensioners. Opened in 2009 by Charles, Prince of Wales it is a state-of-the-art care home that offers nursing and a GP surgery. The Matron is in charge of the infirmary and has a team including nurses, therapists and care staff. The MTI has a gym and a hydrotherapy pool for use by In-Pensioners. It has a range of activities pensioners can join, from pottery classes to poetry recitals. The infirmary received the Quality Hallmark Award at Beacon Status (the highest level possible) from the National Gold Standards Framework Centre in End of Life Care in 2015.

===Ceremonies===

The annual Ceremony of the Christmas Cheeses is based on a 300-year-old tradition which began in 1692, when the Royal Hospital Chelsea asked a local cheesemonger to provide in-pensioners with cheese to get them through the festive period. The Dairy Council is now in its 56th year of organising a special ceremony at the hospital, where donations from cheesemongers from across the country are presented to the residents. A Chelsea pensioner cuts the ceremonial cheese with a sword and the cheese is distributed among the pensioners around the Christmas period.

Another annual tradition at the Royal Hospital is the Christmas Cake Ceremony, which commenced in 1949. It is a symbol of the enduring friendship between the UK and Australia and takes the form of a Christmas cake being presented to the hospital from the Australian Returned and Services League, with each Australian state taking it in turns year by year. Again, a pensioner at the Royal Hospital cuts the cake with a sword.

==Public opening and events==

The on-site museum details the history and life of the Royal Hospital and its In-Pensioners, together with displays of artefacts, documents, medals, cap badges and uniforms. Recent additions include the Sovereign&#x27;s mace and Parade Chair. A large diorama depicts the Royal Hospital and Ranelagh Gardens as they appeared in 1742. Daily walking tours of the site and museum, led by Chelsea pensioners themselves, can be booked in advance.

The South Grounds of the Royal Hospital are also used for large-scale public events including the world-famous Chelsea Flower Show, held by the Royal Horticultural Society. The show has been held in the grounds since 1913, and attracts around 165,000 visitors.

In September 2022, the hospital served as the meeting point for foreign heads of state, leaders, and ambassadors to gather ahead of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s funeral. From there, the dignitaries traveled to Westminster Abbey by coach.

===Singora Cannon===
Prominently displayed in the grounds next to the flagpole is an inscribed cannon from Singora bearing the seal of Sultan Sulaiman Shah. The cannon was made in Singora around 1623, captured from the Sultanate of Singora by the Siamese in 1680, taken from the Siamese by the Burmese in the Burmese–Siamese war of 1765–1767 and transported to Burma. In the third Anglo-Burmese War (1885–1887) the cannon was taken by the British and shipped back to England.

==Organisation==

The hospital maintains a &#x27;military-based culture which puts a premium on comradeship&#x27;. The in-pensioners are formed into four companies, each headed by a Captain of Invalids (an ex-Army officer responsible for the &#x27;day to day welfare, management and administration&#x27; of the pensioners under his charge).

There is also a Secretary who traditionally was responsible for paying the Army pensions, but today they look after the annual budget, staff, buildings and grounds.
Further senior staff include the Physician &amp; Surgeon, the Matron, the Quartermaster, the Chaplain and the Adjutant.

A Board of Commissioners has governed the Royal Hospital since 1702. The ex-officio chairman of the board is HM Paymaster General (whose predecessor Sir Stephen Fox was instrumental in founding the hospital in the seventeenth century). The purpose of the Board is &#x27;to guide the development of The Royal Hospital, ensuring the care and well-being of the residents who live there and safeguarding the historic buildings and grounds, which it owns in trust&#x27;.

Royal Hospital is also a ward of the Kensington and Chelsea Council. The population at the 2011 Census was 7,252.

<doc id="715660" wikidata="Q3916552" url="?curid=715660" title="Damian Wilson">
<text>Damian Wilson (born 11 October 1969) is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Wilson works in the progressive metal genre and was the lead singer of Headspace and Threshold. He sang and toured with bands and projects for Star One, Ayreon, Landmarq, Praying Mantis and with Rick Wakeman&#x27;s English Rock Ensemble.

As a solo artist he has released 5 solo albums, a DVD and a retrospective compilation album.

==1990 – 2000==
Damian began recording music in 1991 with the band Landmarq. He featured on their debut album, &quot;Solitary Witness&quot; which was released in 1992, followed by a second album, &quot;Infinity Parade&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Vision Pit&quot; (1995).

Wilson sang on English prog metal band Threshold&#x27;s debut album Wounded Land&#x27; (1993). In 1996, Wilson joined up with Threshold again to record their third album Extinct Instinct&#x27;. Another successful European tour followed, after which Wilson left the group. During that time Iron Maiden approached Wilson to audition and considered him as a replacement for the departing Bruce Dickinson.

In 1997, Wilson&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Cosmas&quot; was released. This album was a departure from the heavy/progressive rock sound to which his fans had become accustomed.

In 1998, Wilson was one of the lead vocalists on Arjen Lucassen&#x27;s Ayreon album &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;.

From 1998 to 2000 he played the lead role of Jean Valjean in Sir Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s touring production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. He was asked to audition for the role after he tripped over the dog owned by an actor who knew his work, while running along the Thames.

==2000 – 2010==
After the &quot;Les Misérables&quot; tour, Wilson sang on the next three Ayreon albums The Dream Sequencer, Flight of the Migrator and Ayreonauts Only. His collaboration with Arjen Lucassen resulted in three more Star One albums; Space Metal (2002), Live on Earth (2003) and Victims of the Modern Age (2010).
In 2000 and 2001, Wilson toured Europe and South America with Rick Wakeman as part of the English Rock Ensemble. This resulted in a Live DVD and an album &quot;Out There&quot;.

After the tour with Rick Wakeman, Wilson released his second solo album &quot;Disciple&quot; (2001) which was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. The recording session at Abbey Road was filmed and broadcast by the BBC.Wilson toured his solo material with a full band under the name &quot;Damian Wilson Band&quot;. A second tour was planned, but Wilson was hospitalized and the tour was cancelled. A studio session recording of the rehearsals for the tour was released on CD in 2002, &quot;Live in Rehearsal&quot;. In 2003 Wilson &#x27;s third official album &quot;Let’s Start A Commune&quot; was released.
Together with Adam Wakeman Wilson formed the progressive metal band Headspace. Mainly to keep in contact with each other between their busy touring schedules. An EP &quot;I Am&quot; was released in 2007 and they supported Ozzy Osbourne on his Black Rain tour in 2007.

Just before the start of their &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; tour, Threshold singer Andrew McDermott left the band. Having only a few days to learn the new Threshold material, Wilson stepped in as lead vocalist for the tour. Reinstated as lead vocalist, for the first time since 1997, Wilson continued to tour with the band. 
In 2009 Wilson toured Europe with his &quot;Damian Wilson Band&quot;. This time he performed songs from the bands and projects he had been involved in as well as solo material. The tour was filmed and released in 2011 as 3DVD set including a live concert and tour documentary &quot;Cheers Lads; 20 Years Of Avoiding A Job&quot;.

==2010 – present==

Within Temptation guitarist Ruud Jolie, who also played guitar during the 2009 DWB tour, asked Wilson to sing for his side project Maiden uniteD’; a collective of musicians that play rearranged acoustic version of Iron Maiden tracks. Wilson and Anneke van Giersbergen sang on their first album &quot;Mind The Acoustic Pieces&quot; (2010). After a small club tour the project takes off and Wilson played venues and big festivals in Europe. He recorded two more albums with the project &quot;Across The Seventh Sea&quot; (2012) and &quot;Remembrance&quot; (2015).

Wilson also released a 31-track retrospective double album, &quot;I Thought The World Was Listening 1997–2011&quot;. This album featured remastered tracks from throughout Wilson&#x27;s solo career, re-recorded versions of songs and previously unreleased new material. The release of this album also marked the return to the stage as a solo artist. Wilson has been playing select solo shows, mainly acoustic, through Europe since 2011.

Wilson&#x27;s solo album &quot;Cosmas&quot; was re-released as a remastered edition in 2012. On the last of a series of solo shows he played the album in its entirety.

Headspace signed a three-record deal with Inside Out Music and their debut album &quot;I Am Anonymous&quot; was released in 2012. It is a concept album in which Wilson&#x27;s lyrics are directed the listener. 
&quot;This is about you and your relationship with humanity, ultimately the battles fought within the mind from child to man. Through Kubler Ross&#x27; model of impending death, with reference to war, the turmoil leads us to peace and acceptance... only then to swing straight back round to chaos&quot;. A second album was released in 2016; &quot;All That You Fear Is Gone&quot;.

2012 was also the year in which Threshold released its first album since 1996 with Wilson as lead vocalist, &quot;March Of Progress&quot;, followed by a European club and festival tour. A second album, &quot;For The Journey&quot;, followed in 2014. The following tour was recorded and released as double live album &quot;European Journey&quot; in 2015. Threshold and Wilson parted ways in 2017. 

In October 2015, he announced two new albums for 2016. &quot;Weir Keeper&#x27;s Tale&quot;; an acoustic album with Adam Wakeman, which was released in January 2016, and a new solo album, his first in over a decade.
&quot;I&#x27;ve never stopped writing songs so I have accumulated a lot since my last solo album. In June we have started recording in Dublin with some amazing musicians from all over Europe. We’re happy to say that we’ve come a long way these last couple of months and the album is taking shape. I believe we’re creating something worthy of your expectations. The songs reflect on how our personal relationships are relevant to the bigger picture, even on a world level&quot;, he stated.

The new album &quot;Built for Fighting&quot; was released 9 September 2016. The album contains 11 new original songs and a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s Somebody &quot;Built for Fighting&quot; was mixed and mastered in Sweden by the Fascination Street duo Jens Bogren and Tony Lindgren, who have worked with acts such as Opeth, Devin Townsend and Headspace.

The track &quot;Thrill Me&quot; was released as a single on 9 August and made the BBC Radio 2 playlist. On 4 August 2017, a new version of the song &quot;Impossible&quot; was released. The track was remixed by Dave Bascombe.

The second album with Adam Wakeman, accompanied with a 22-date acoustic tour, was released in February 2018; &quot;The Sun Will Dance in Its Twilight Hour&quot;. After the tour they went into the studio for one day and tried to capture the onstage chemistry. They recorded everything and released it as a session album &quot;Stripped&quot; in January 2019.

Wilson released a five-track EP on his 50th birthday, 11 October 2019. The EP &quot;Thank You&quot; was a return to a more classical approach of recording, just with piano and string orchestra.

It was announced on 14 July 2020 that Wilson had joined the band Arena, following the departure of their previous singer Paul Manzi.

<text>Amambay () is a department in Paraguay. The capital is Pedro Juan Caballero.

The name comes from the name of a part of the Caaguazú Cordillera, &quot;Amambai Mountains&quot;. Amambay is the name of a fern, typical of the forest in the region.

== Districts ==

The department is divided in 6 districts:

# Bella Vista
# Capitán Bado
# Karapaí
# Pedro Juan Caballero
# Zanja Pytá
#Cerro Corá

== History ==

For a long time, the land was occupied by the natives of the region and suffered the attacks of the Bandeirantes that were looking for the Guaranís, who were able to find refuge in the jungle of the area.

After the Paraguayan War, vast expanses of land passed to the hands of foreign businessmen dedicated to exploiting yerba mate and lumber.

Pedro Juan Caballero was found in 1893, and Bella Vista, in 1902. The department of Amambay was created in 1945 as the No. 10 department of the country. After some reorganization it was declared as the No. 13 department.

The population in the area was consolidated with the establishment of rural colonies dedicated to agriculture and livestock industries.

Pedro Juan Caballero, the capital of the department, is still known by its old name, Punta Porá, used by the traveling merchants that transported yerba from Mato Grosso to Concepción.

In 2020 Amambay, as an important drug trafficking route, while accounting for just 2.4% of the country’s population, suffered over a quarter of its murders.

==Geography==
Amambay is located in the north part of the Oriental Region of Paraguay. The exact geographic location is between the parallels 55° 28′ and 57° 00′ of West longitude and between meridians 22° 05′ and 23° 05′ of South latitude.
=== Limits ===
The limits are:
To the North: Brazil, from which is separated by the Apa River and Amambay Cordillera.

To the South: Canindeyú Department

To the East: Brazil, from which is separated by the Amambay Cordillera

To the West: Concepción and San Pedro Departments

=== Climate ===

The average temperature is 21 °C; it reaches 35 °C in summer and drops to −1 °C in winter. The rainy months are January, February and March.

=== Orography and soil ===

In the territory are predominant, from north to south sandstone and rocks.

Amambay is the highest of Paraguayan territories, it reaches 300 to 400 meters, and the Punta Porá Hill reaches even 700 meters. The Amambay Cordillera serves as the natural limit with Brazil and from it parts the Serranía Cerro Corá, Tacurupytá, Guasú, Alambique, Tuna and Tangaró.

Some isolated hills are: Tranquerita, Tacuara, Verón Cué and Cuatiá.

=== Hydrography ===

The Apa River delimits the territory to the North, just as the Estrella Stream does with Brazil. The Aquidabán River and the streams Tapiracuai, Aquidabán-mi, Cabayu and Guazú are also in Amambay.

The West of the department is bordered by the Ypané River and others such as Tutytí, Aguaray Verde, Puente de la Tabla Puendy and Ypané-mi.

=== Natural environment ===

The entire department belongs to the Ecological Region of Amambay. The ecosystem has a great variety of fauna and flora.

The richness natural resources in the region causes the department to be highly affected by deforestation. Some species of plants currently in danger of extinction include local palm tree species, the karanday, the arary, various species of ferns, clovers, the yvyra paje, kai kygua, and local cedars.

In addition, there are some animal species that are in danger too: gua&#x27;a sa&#x27;yju, jacaré ita, and guasuti.

The protected areas are:

* Estrella Forest: 30.000 hectares
* Pira’y Forest: 22.500 hectares
* Guasú Hill: 15.000 hectares
* Sarambí Hill: 15.000 hectares.

Cerro Corá National Park was created by decree No. 20.698 on February 11, 1976, with a surface of 12.038 hectares. It is located in Pedro Juan Caballero&#x27;s district.

== Tourism ==

Amambay is a department very favored by nature&#x27;s beauty. Amambay Cordillera forms a chain of mountains: Cerro Corá, Tacurý Pytá, Guasú and Alambique. The most important hills are: Cerro Corá, located in the National Park, Acuá, Lorito, Guasú, Muralle and Sarambí.

In Cerro Corá, on the banks of Aquidabán Nigui River in 1870 an historic event took place: the death of Marshal Francisco Solano López, in the Battle of Cerro Corá. In the National Park, there is a monument to him.

In Cerro Guasú, Yasuká Verá, there are caverns and rests of human artifacts of archeological importance that date from 2.500 to 3.800 years ago.

Tapé Tuyá is a road the remaining Paraguayan army took in the campaign of 1896–1870. The area was inhabited by colonies of natives of the Tupí Guaraní Family, the Paí Tavyterá and Ava Guaraní. There is a hill in there that was considered to be a holy place by the Ava Guaraní. They thought it was the center of the Earth, where the world was created and were born the first man and the first woman.

In Pedro Juan Caballero, the beaches in the banks of Aquidabán River are places of great beauty and attract many visitors, just as do the commercial centers in the city.

The beaches in Bella Vista are much visited by the tourists.

<doc id="715663" wikidata="Q3196369" url="?curid=715663" title="Kid Flash">
<text>Kid Flash is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in comic books published by DC Comics, originally created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino, as a junior counterpart to DC Comics superhero The Flash. The first version of the character, [[Wally West]], debuted in &quot;The Flash&quot; #110 (1959). The character, along with others like the first Wonder Girl, Aqualad, and Speedy, was created in response to the success of Batman&#x27;s young sidekick Robin. These young heroes would later be spun off into their own superhero team, the Teen Titans. As Kid Flash, Wally West made regular appearances in Flash related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1959 through the mid-1980s until the character was reinvented as the new version of The Flash.

Later, well after Wally West had made a name for himself as the new Flash, the character of [[Bart Allen]], grandson of the Flash Barry Allen, was brought into the past from his home in the future and served as the young hero Impulse. In 2003, with writer Geoff Johns&#x27; relaunch of a new &quot;Teen Titans&quot; volume, Bart donned the mantle of Kid Flash after being nearly killed by the assassin Deathstroke. As Kid Flash, Bart appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; and &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) regularly until the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; event, where he became the fourth Flash after Wally West&#x27;s disappearance. Apparently killed by the Rogues, Bart was resurrected in the 31st century by Legion of Super-Heroes member Brainiac 5 and retook the mantle of Kid Flash. Following a 2011 reboot, DC introduced a new interpretation of Wally West as its latest Kid Flash in 2014, who was later established as being the original Wally&#x27;s younger cousin [[Ace West|Wallace &quot;Ace&quot; West]].

The Wally West Kid Flash was first adapted for live action in the Arrowverse series of TV shows, played by Keiynan Lonsdale.

==Fictional character biographies==

===Wally West===
Outside of Iris West, Kid Flash was the first person to whom Flash revealed the secret of his double-identity (&quot;The Flash&quot; #120 (May 1961)). In that story, the two speedsters were inadvertently thrown 25 million years into the past, where they battled a race of golden humanoids. It was only the first of many time-trips for the pair, who teamed up next to try out Flash&#x27;s Cosmic Treadmill.

Shortly after meeting Flash&#x27;s friend Elongated Man, Kid Flash received his own unique costume. The Flash, who had been toying with a new design for Wally, was inspecting an alien mind over-matter machine when, in a burst of light, the new costume sprang from his mind and onto the body of his protégé. Since the new outfit exposed Wally&#x27;s bright red hair, Flash provided his costume-storage ring with a special instant-dye spray with which he could easily change his hair color, as Wally, to brown.

The boy speedster first met Robin and Aqualad in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #54 (June–July 1964), in an adventure that would predicate the formation of the Teen Titans shortly thereafter. Kid Flash remained a member in good standing of that team, though his participation limited his involvement in solo adventures considerably. At 18 Wally revealed his alter-ego to his parents Bob and Mary for the first time, chose his university (Taggart), and confided to the Flash his intentions to retire from superheroing upon graduation from college so that he might live a normal life.

As it happened, he left his crime-fighting career behind even before that, when he retired from the third incarnation of the Teen Titans for personal reasons, including a desire to devote more time to studying, to his new girlfriend Frances Kane, and because, as a result of his changing metabolism, he was beginning to lose his powers.

Kid Flash came out of retirement to fight in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, and was hit harder than anyone when the heroes found Flash&#x27;s costume and ring and realized that their compatriot was dead. However, even though a blast from the Anti-Monitor reduced Wally&#x27;s top speed to that of sound, it cured him of his metabolic malady. This, combined with the desire to honor his mentor and friend, caused Wally West to discard his Kid Flash identity and, instead, adopt the name and costume of Flash. However, after fully accepting that Barry was not returning, West removed a mental block, unlocking his true powers, making him faster than Barry Allen. He also acquired unique abilities such as sharing and stealing speed, and accessing the speed force itself, allowing time travel. When it was eventually discovered that Barry Allen was, in fact, alive, Wally took on his own version of the Flash costume, fighting alongside Barry Allen and his grandson, Bart Allen (Impulse or for a time Kid Flash).
===Bart Allen===
Bart, the child from the future known as the hero Impulse. After Max Mercury disappeared in the timestream, Bart took up residence in Keystone City with Jay Garrick, the original Flash, and Jay&#x27;s wife Joan.

When a mysterious android from the future known as Indigo attacked the Titans and Young Justice, it resulted in the apparent deaths of Donna Troy and Omen. At Donna&#x27;s funeral, Nightwing disbanded the Titans. The members of Young Justice, especially Wonder Girl, felt responsible for the tragic deaths. This led Wonder Girl, Robin, Impulse and Superboy to form a new group of Teen Titans under the guidance of the more experienced Cyborg, Starfire, and Beast Boy. Despite Wally West&#x27;s misgivings, Bart accepted an invitation to join the new Teen Titans.

Bart was later injured when Deathstroke put a shotgun to his leg. Thankfully, his accelerated healing enabled a handful of surgeons to replace his kneecap with an artificial one, and Bart was back on his feet in a matter of hours, but the effects of this encounter were much more than physical. Feeling unsure and tired of being underestimated, Bart went to the local public library and read every single book in the building. He retained that knowledge and balanced it with lack of experience. With a renewed sense of confidence, Bart left his impulsive rep behind and returned to the team as Kid Flash.

When Superboy-Prime ran amok during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Kid Flash and the super-speedsters raced to stop his rampage. While running to subdue the deranged Teen of Steel, Wally West disappeared in a burst of lightning (later to return). Meanwhile, the speedsters&#x27; combined might defeated Superboy-Prime, but severed their connection to the Speed Force in the process. Bart returned to warn the heroes of Superboy-Prime&#x27;s escape. But while mere moments had passed in the present, Bart returned from his time-bending journey four years older. Bart handed his grandfather&#x27;s costume to Jay Garrick, claiming he used up all his speed powers during the final battle.

Bart still had his powers, but faced with the guilt over Superboy-Prime&#x27;s escape, he initially decided to retire his costume. He took a job as a factory worker in Keystone City, but soon realized he must use his abilities to protect innocents. Although Bart found new challenges in harnessing the speed force, he accepted his destiny as the latest Flash in the Allen family tradition. In his efforts to tame the speed force inside him, Bart turned to S.T.A.R. Labs intern, Valerie Perez, and their relationship quickly blossomed into a full-blown romance.

Once accepting the mantle of the Flash, Bart moved to Los Angeles, California and enrolled in the Police Academy. Robin asked him to join the Titans but Bart declined, saying he&#x27;d rather work towards membership in the Justice League of America. Shortly after resuming the mantle, Iris Allen warned Bart that if he fought the newly formed league of Rogues, he would not survive. Inertia, in a plan to steal the speed force energy for himself, manipulated the Rogues into battle with Bart. As a depowered Bart fought valiantly against the combined might of the Rogues, he saw the spectre of the Black Flash, and died as Iris Allen and Valerie Perez were left to mourn him.

Later on New Earth, during the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline, Superman was called to the thirty-first century to assist the Legion of Super-Heroes in fending off Superboy-Prime, who was thrown to the future in the aftermath of the destruction of Earth-51 and the &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot;. Prime, raging about his minor place in history as a Superman rival, released the Legion of Super-Villains from the prison planet Takron-Galtos and waged war on Earth and the Legion. In response to this, Brainiac 5 summoned the Legions of Three Worlds (alternate earths) to combat Prime&#x27;s forces. Revealing that the Legion had captured &quot;living lightning&quot; in the Legion&#x27;s last trip to present Earth in &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot;, Brainiac 5 had Legionnaire XS run on the cosmic treadmill while the three Lightning Lads activated the &quot;lightning rod&quot; to release the living lightning. Although he tried to stop them, Superboy-Prime was unable to stop the lightning from being unleashed. A fully formed alive-and-well Bart Allen, in his Kid Flash uniform, appeared before him.

When the New 52 universe began, the Kid Flash working with the Titans was known as Bart Allen. He ended up with a different backstory, and eventually was written out of the storyline. He was later replaced as Kid Flash by Wally&#x27;s cousin, Wallace West.

=== Wallace West ===
Wallace &quot;Ace&quot; West is the third Kid Flash of the main DC Comics Universe. He first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; (Vol. 4) Annual #3. He is the son of the fifth Reverse Flash, Daniel West, and cousin of the first Kid Flash and third Flash, Wally West. Originally intended as a reinterpretation of Wally for the New 52, he was established as a separate character in DC Rebirth.

<text>Zino was a Greek social networking website. In 2009, it was ranked one of the top Greek social destinations.

==History==
Zino started as a continuation of a news-focused Greek network, chit-chat.gr, which was established in 2005, and eventually replaced it. Three codenames were publicly announced for the launched versions, Reloaded, the first version announced, Phoenix, the version that established it as a social network in Greece, and lastly Revolution, the current version.

==Features==

===User profiles===
Each user has a user profile in the form of &quot;http://username.zino.gr/&quot;, where &quot;username&quot; is a chosen nickname by the user. The user profile lists several user details, among others their gender, age, and other personal information. It also exhibits several user-generated sections of content such as recent journals, polls, answers, photos, and the user&#x27;s music preferences.

===Photo albums===
The users are given the opportunity to upload photos of themselves or other pictures they have taken to their user profile. These pictures are separated into albums, which the user can specify. Zino claims about 140,000 photos.

===Friends===
Like in most social networks, users can add people as their friends. Their friends are listed on their user profile accordingly.

===Journals===
Each user has a personal collection of articles that they can publish under the user profile. This collection is called &quot;journals&quot;, and is publicly available for anyone to read.

===Questions and answers===
Each user is asked several personal questions while using the web application, allowing him to provide an answer or skip the question. These answers are then publicly available on the user&#x27;s profile for other users to see, a feature that allows the owner to reveal numerous details about themselves.

===Polls===
Users are provided with the ability to raise a question on their user profile, which other users can then answer. This feature is available through polls, for which the user must specify a question and the possible answers. Commentary is furthermore available on poll pages after their creation.

==Criticism==

===Greeklish===
Zino has no regulations over the use of Greeklish. This has yielded to the extensive use of Greeklish, making it hard to read for people not familiar with the language. This policy of the website has been heavily criticized. Various campaigns have sprung to support or defend the usage of Greeklish with the website over time.

===Data retention===
Another controversy of the website was the inability to delete user accounts, but this feature was later added after the users&#x27; request. The inability to remove comments after they have been posted, a feature also long requested by users, still remains a controversy.

<doc id="715674" wikidata="Q887630" url="?curid=715674" title="George Mathews (soldier)">
<text>George Mathews (August 30, 1739 – August 30, 1812) was an American soldier and politician from the U.S. States of Virginia and Georgia. He was a brevet brigadier general in the Continental Army, the 20th and 24th Governor of Georgia, a U.S. Representative from Georgia, and the leading participant in the Patriot War of East Florida.

Born in Augusta County in the Virginia Colony, Mathews was in early life a merchant and planter. As an officer in the colonial militia, he gained statewide fame for his role in the Battle of Point Pleasant of Dunmore&#x27;s War. He was afterward elected to the House of Burgesses from Augusta County, but did not attend a session. On the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, he served as colonel of the 9th Virginia Regiment in the Continental Army. He and his entire regiment were captured on October 4, 1777, in the Battle of Germantown. Mathews spent the next four years as a prisoner of war, including two years on a British prison ship. He was brevetted brigadier general at the end of the war.

After the war, Mathews moved to the state of Georgia and was quickly elected governor of the state. He served two nonconsecutive terms, voted to ratify the United States Constitution, and served in the 1st United States Congress. His second term as governor was overshadowed by his involvement in the Yazoo Land Fraud, which led to his political downfall.

Mathews relocated to the Mississippi Territory and in 1810 was sent as a secret agent by President James Madison to annex the Spanish territory of East Florida for the United States. Mathews was unable to claim the territory peacefully, so he created an insurrectionist force that captured Ferninanda Beach and Amelia Island and turned them over to the U.S. This act, now referred to as the Patriot War of East Florida, was denounced by Spain and its allies. Madison, under political pressure, disavowed Mathews&#x27;s actions. The vagueness of Madison&#x27;s instructions to Mathews have led to significant debate among historians as to whether Mathews acted outside of the purview of his mandate.

== Early life and education==

George Mathews was born on August 30, 1739, in Augusta County in the Virginia Colony to Ann (Archer) and John Mathews. His parents immigrated to America during the early years of the Scotch-Irish on 1717–1775. His father was an early and notable member of the Augusta County community, serving as a militia captain and &quot;de facto&quot; public officer, as well as being a member of the Augusta Parish vestry. The Mathews were among the Anglican minority in the predominantly Presbeterian county. The young George Mathews had ten siblings; six brothers and four sisters. He was &quot;by far the crudest, most dynamic, energetic, colorful, and capable of the seven boys.&quot; He may have been educated at the local Augusta Academy, although whatever schooling he obtained, he remained mostly illiterate throughout his life. As a boy, George Mathews played and explored in the woods around his father&#x27;s farm, and quickly gained experience with frontier dangers from local Indian tribes, rebuffing raids from the Indians into the frontier settlement.

==Early career==

On his father&#x27;s death, Mathews was willed of farm land
By 1762, George and a brother, Sampson Mathews, began a mercantile enterprise in Staunton, Virginia, and soon had acquired extensive property along the western frontier as far west as the Greenbrier district. The brothers established several outposts along this stretch, where they sold both frontier necessities and specialty goods, importing goods through Atlantic trade markets. The brothers additionally dealt in forced labor, mostly through contracts for convict servants from Ireland, but also African slaves. The brothers were among the &quot;soul-drivers&quot; in Virginia who bought convict servants wholesale from British transport ships at port, and traveled along established routes selling the convicts to farmers, planters, and others. Lodine-Chaffey suggests that the brothers&#x27; treatment of both convict servants and slaves was suspect, due to the frequency in which the servants and slaves escaped them; the brothers reported three slaves missing in 1769, and ten convicts missing in 1773. In total, their dealings in all ventures accounted for a &quot;great share&quot; of the trade in the region.

Mathews was elected to the Augusta Parish vestry in 1763, joining his brother Sampson who had been a member since 1761. The brothers maintained their seats on the vestry until a shift in political population caused them to be ousted by the Presbyterian majority.

The Mathews brothers were appointed trustees of Staunton in 1772. At this time, Staunton was an important trade center in the backcountry, and it along with other backcountry trade centers like Salisbury, North Carolina, contributed significantly to economic expansion in the colonies, including the development of port cities like Baltimore, Maryland, Norfolk, Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia. This mid-18th century economic boom has been cited a major origin of the American Revolution. Mathews took an increasingly active role civic affairs during this period. In Augusta County he served as a vestryman from 1763 to 1768, high sheriff from 1770 to 1771, and justice of the peace from 1769 to 1770 and 1773 to 1775. He was appointed a captain of militia in 1766.

Mathews first gained wider recognition for his role in the October 4, 1774, Battle of Point Pleasant. In the fall of 1774, Royal Governor Lord Dunmore assembled an invasion of Native American territory along the Ohio River, culling a thousand troops largely from the Virginia frontier. The Native Americans, under the Shawnee Chief Cornstalk, attacked Virginia militia, attempting to halt its advance into the Ohio Country. Rembert Patrick described the battle as &quot;a typical Indian battle where every man found a tree, and military discipline in the English sense was unknown.&quot; Mathews, dressed in a hunting shirt and moccasins, killed 9 Indians while remaining uninjured himself. The tide of the battle turned when the militia enacted a flanking maneuver late in the day, initiating Cornstalk&#x27;s retreat. Credit for this maneuver has typically been given either to Andrew Lewis or George Mathews. From his newfound celebrity, Mathews won a special election to what became the last session of the House of Burgesses in 1775. Mathews served alongside Samuel McDowell and succeeded Charles Lewis, who had died in battle before the session began. He had already represented Augusta County in Virginia&#x27;s first Revolutionary Convention in August 1774, alongside both Lewis and McDowell. However, Governor Dunmore dissolved the prorougued assembly before it convened in 1776.

== American Revolutionary War ==

Mathews eagerly sought a military commission on the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. On the creation of the 9th Virginia Regiment in the Continental Army in January 1776, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel. The regiment joined General George Washington&#x27;s army in December 1776, in which it embarked on Washington&#x27;s Philadelphia campaign. By February 1777, Mathews was promoted to colonel of the 9th Virginia Regiment.

Mathews&#x27;s regiment saw its first significant action during the September 11, 1777, Battle of Brandywine. The battle, fought between Washington&#x27;s army and the British army of General Sir William Howe, was both the largest battle of the Revolution, with nearly 30,000 total belligerents, and the longest single-day battle of the war, with continuous fighting for 11 hours. The British defeated the Americans and forced them into a retreat that &quot;nearly developed into a stampede.&quot; Mathews&#x27;s regiment was one of the last to leave the field of battle, causing some to credit him for saving the American army from rout.

Following its victory, the British army set up camp in Germantown. On October 4, General Washington launched an attack on the British camp, initiating the Battle of Germantown. Mathews led a charge early in the day that resulted in the capture up to 100 British soldiers; however, as the day progressed Mathews penetrated so deeply into British lines that he became isolated from Washington&#x27;s army and was engulfed by opposing troops. This resulted in the capture or death of his entire regiment, with Mathews claiming to have &quot;bled from five wounds&quot; during the ordeal. The given reasons for his capture vary; some claim he did not receive Washington&#x27;s orders to retreat, while others claim his regiment became lost in the fog and smoke of battle. Nationally, he received acclaim and his reputation grew as a result of his daring. He spent much of the remaining revolution as a prisoner of war, first held at Philadelphia, and later on a prison ship anchored in New York Harbor. The severity of Mathews&#x27;s injuries caused a British surgeon to deem him &quot;incurable.&quot;
By 1779, however, Mathews recovered was granted a limited parole and permitted to live in New York City. He wrote to Governor Thomas Jefferson and to the Continental Congress urging a prisoner exchange. Jefferson wrote to Mathews to explain his decision to leave him in New York City as a parolee and instead exchange for others still suffering in much worse conditions on the prison ships. Mathews turned his attention toward the improvement of living conditions for fellow prisoners of war, securing money and provisions for this aim from Congress and the State of Virginia. He was formally exchanged on December 5, 1781, at which point he was given command of the 3rd Virginia Regiment and went with Major General Nathaniel Greene into the southern theater, though he saw no further action in the war. Mathews was brevetted brigadier general at the end of the war; on September 30, 1783, Congress conferred a &quot;general brevet&quot; on the officers Continental Army, advancing all below the rank of major general by one rank. Mathews was an Original Member of the Society of the Cincinnati.

== Political career in Georgia==
During Mathews&#x27;s military tour of the South, he had been impressed with the opportunities for political and financial gain on the Georgia frontier. When the 3rd Virginia Regiment was formally disbanded on January 1, 1783, he quickly petitioned the Georgia government for land, and received in Wilkes County. He liquidated his property and settled his business affairs in Virginia and headed to the new Georgia frontier. There he and his wife, Ann Polly Paul, built a log cabin at Goose Pond. They had eight children: John, Charles Lewis, George, William, Ann, Jane, Margaret, and Rebecca. His wife Ann Polly died a few years after their arrival in Georgia. Mathews briefly returned to Staunton, Virginia, in 1790, where he married Margaret Reed, a widow. In 1793, Margaret went back to Virginia to visit friends and family, and when she later wrote to her husband to facilitate her return, he replied, &quot;I didn&#x27;t take you to Virginia, and I&#x27;m not going to trouble myself to go there and bring you back.&quot; The two never reconciled, and the Georgia legislature granted a divorce on February 3, 1797.

On the strength of his military reputation, Mathews quickly ascended to the top of Georgia state politics. He was appointed a judge in Wilkes County, and a town commissioner for Washington, Georgia. Two years later, on January 2, 1787, he was elected a member of the Georgia General Assembly; three days after that, he was elected 20th governor of the state for a one-year term. Mathews&#x27;s brief term as governor was a successful one; he attended the 1787 state convention in which he voted ratify the United States Constitution, and left with the state in a position of stability. He was then elected to the House of Representatives for the 1st United States Congress. His term in Congress has been called &quot;lackluster,&quot; owing in part to his &#x27;frontier sensibilities&#x27; that were out of place in Congress. He was defeated for reelection in 1791, and launched a failed bid for the United States Senate the following year. However, by 1793, he had regained enough support to again be chosen the 24th governor of the state.

His second administration was more tumultuous than his first. At this time, the State of Georgia struggled to defend its vast land claims in the western part of the state, and this led to notable controversies during Mathews&#x27;s tenure. In February 1794, General Elijah Clarke, a popular veteran of the American Revolutionary War, illegally established the Trans-Oconee Republic as an independent state on western state hunting grounds reserved by the federal Treaty of New York (1790) for the Creek Indians. President Washington pressured Mathews to remove Clarke and his settlers from the Creek lands, but Mathews initially ignored the pressure, sympathizing with Clarke&#x27;s aim and being aware of Clarke&#x27;s local popularity as a hero of the Revolution. However, the tide of public opinion eventually changed, and in September, Mathews authorized 1200 Georgia militiamen, acting in conjunction with federal troops, to surround and isolate General Clarke&#x27;s fortifications, leading to Clarke&#x27;s surrender.
The Georgia legislature sought to relieve its burden of its unprotected western lands by encouraging purchase offers from private land speculators. When representatives from four private groups sought to buy 35 million acres extending to the Mississippi River at less than two cents per acre, Mathews initially rejected the proposal. However, the groups bribed many Georgia politicians to favor the bill, and this increased political pressure combined with waning popularity caused Mathews ultimately to accept and sign the Yazoo land bill. The public became outraged on learning the details of the bill, leading to protests to federal officials and Congressmen. Mathews, though he did not personally profit from the bill, became its public face. Jared Irwin and U.S. Senator James Jackson led the reform efforts. Irwin was elected governor of Georgia to replace Mathews, and on February 13, 1796, less than two months after taking office, he signed a bill nullifying the Yazoo Act.

Mathews never again held a public office. He thought for a time about leaving the United States, and even wrote to George Washington asking for a character recommendation in preparation for his removal from the country, to which Washington obliged. However, in 1797, Mathews, who had by this time remarried again to Mary Carpenter, instead turned to the Mississippi Territory, where his wife owned property. Mathews again returned to land speculation, buying stock in a land company the claimant of extensive acreage in the territory. He also lobbied friends in Congress for a political appointment in the territory.

In 1798, he was appointed the first governor of the Mississippi Territory by President John Adams. However, Secretary of War James McHenry objected to the appointment, citing Mathews&#x27;s financial stake in the territory. When Adams withdrew the nomination, Mathews was reported to have responded: &quot;Sir, if you had known me, you wouldn&#x27;t have taken the nomination back; if you didn&#x27;t know me, you should not have nominated me to such an important office.&quot;

== Patriot War of East Florida ==
In November 1810, George Mathews learned from West Florida Governor Don Vicente Folch that Folch might be willing to peacefully transfer West Florida to the United States, on account of the weakening of the Spanish monarchy due to its involvement in the Napoleonic Wars. Mathews brought this to the attention of President James Madison, who wished to build on the expansionist policies of his predecessor, Thomas Jefferson. Madison, with ambitions raised, determined to annex both West and East Florida all at once.

Madison and Mathews met in Washington, D.C., in January 1811, to discuss strategy for carrying out the annexation. Madison gave Mathews &quot;remarkably vague and general&quot; directions to incite a rebellion among Spanish subjects, if necessary, and in turn to accept any territories controlled by these rebel forces into the domain of the United States. Neither men took any notes about this meeting, with even the specific day of the meeting still unknown. Madison formally assigned Mathews and Indian agent John McKee as secret agents soon after, and they promptly headed south.

Mathews and McKee created an intelligence network throughout East Florida, with Mathews writing to Secretary of State James Monroe frequently. Monroe in turn encouraged Mathews to continue so long as the opportunity remained realistic. Over the weeks, however, Mathews would write many letters to Monroe that would receive no reply. Though unsettled, Mathews viewed this as an implicit endorsement of his plan, assuming the Madison administration was acting discreetly and desiring not to leave evidence of U.S. involvement. However, Madison historian J.C.A. Stagg suggests that the Madison administration followed an informal practice in which &quot;silence implied not consent but its opposite.&quot; This practice, which the administration did not explain, resulted in several misunderstandings with high-level officials throughout the Madison administration.

Mathews became infected with malaria in the summer of 1811, and for weeks was beset to his house at St. Mary&#x27;s, Georgia on the border of Georgia and Florida. Nevertheless, he wrote to Monroe in August 1811, stating his readiness to outfit a rebel force, and requesting supplies. Mathews&#x27; plans were leaked to Spanish authorities late in the summer, and the Spanish government wrote to Monroe urging him to disavow Mathews&#x27; actions and place him in arrest. Monroe instead responded with justifications for American rights to East Florida, arguing &quot;the United States should have seized on that country [East Florida] long ago&quot; as collateral from unpaid debts from Spain to the U.S. He took the further step to publish this rationale in an official Madison administration newspaper.

This confirmed to Mathews the Madison administration&#x27;s support of his plans in lieu of direct correspondence, and additionally proved beneficial to his recruiting efforts. By the end of 1811, he had filled leadership positions for his rebellion with wealthy Spanish planters and businessmen. Still, he had not found enough local interest to fill out a fighting force. Mathews therefore turned to the recruitment of volunteers from Georgia to play the part of his rebel Patriots. By early 1812, Mathews&#x27; Patriots numbered about 125. To bolster his force, Mathews worked out a plan for 75 U.S. troops at the border to desert the U.S. army and enlist as Patriots, while Mathews would subsequently ensure their pardon and restoration to their prior military rank at the end of the mission. However, days before the Patriots were to cross into Florida, Major Jacint Laval—Mathews&#x27; housemate in St. Mary&#x27;s -- discovered Mathews&#x27;s plan to lure men of his division into desertion, and objected, raising alarm. Mathews then knew he did not have the numbers needed to take St. Augustine. Fearing his window for a surprise attack was closing, he turned his attention to the lightly guarded city of Fernandina on Amelia Island, just across the river from St. Mary&#x27;s. He would take Fernandina, call in U.S. troops, and move to St. Augustine from there.

On the night of March 13, 1812, Mathews, with his Patriots and support from nine U.S. Navy gunboats, entered Florida, and quickly seized rural lands off the coast of Amelia Island. A rash of fighters defected to the Patriots, bringing their numbers to about 250, with about 59 being Spanish subjects. Mathews then began negotiations with Don Justo Lopez, commandant of the fort at Fernandina, for the surrender of the city. The Patriots gained control of Fernandina on March 16, without a shot fired. The Patriots raised a new flag of East Florida designed by a member of Mathews&#x27; staff, held the territory for 24 hours, and then turned it over to the United States. Mathews wrote to Madison of the mission&#x27;s success, while also requesting additional U.S. military personnel in acknowledgment of the difficulty he had faced in galvanizing local support. Mathews also revealed to Madison his intention to similarly overthrow Spanish rule of the cities of Mobile and Pensacola in West Florida.

===The Madison administration&#x27;s reaction===
By late 1811, James Madison had become convinced of the inevitability of war with Great Britain on the Canadian border (he would officially declare war with Britain in June 1812, setting off the War of 1812). On learning of Mathews&#x27; request for further U.S. military support in Florida, as well as Spain&#x27;s outrage towards the mission, Madison worried about the possibility of provoking Spain and its allies, the British, to join forces against the U.S. Further, a scandal had broken in national newspapers about Madison&#x27;s purchase of dirt on political opponents from a British secret agent in New England mere days before the news of Mathews&#x27; seizure of Fernandina broke in the papers. While Monroe in particular admitted &quot;much cleverness&quot; in Mathews&#x27;s plan, and hoped to salvage his efforts, he and Madison agreed that the political costs of publicly supporting Mathews at present were too high. Madison publicly repudiated Mathews, relieving him of duty on April 4, 1812. Madison then assigned Georgia Governor David Mitchell as his new special agent in East Florida, tasked with keeping Mathews&#x27; Patriot army intact and preserving its military occupations. Mitchell quickly informed East Florida Governor Juan José de Estrada that any attempt to drive out the Patriots would not be tolerated by the United States.

Mathews, furious with the Madison administration&#x27;s repudiation, set off to Washington, D.C., where he&#x27;d &quot;be damned if [he] didn&#x27;t blow them all up.&quot; However, on the way he suffered from a recurrent malarial fever and was forced to stop in Augusta, Georgia. He died there on his 73rd birthday, and is buried in Saint Paul&#x27;s Church.

===Legacy and historical interpretations===
Historians have been divided over the legacy of the Patriot War of East Florida. Some conclude that Mathews overstepped his authority and deliberately departed from Madison&#x27;s intentions, while others believe Mathews fulfilled Madison&#x27;s intentions, and that Madison repudiated Mathews for political reasons. These differences in analysis are exacerbated by the fact that Madison and Mathews left no notes of their meeting to discuss the campaign.

J.C.A. Stagg, in &quot;George Mathews and John McKee, Revolutionizing East Florida, Mobile, and Pensacola in 1812&quot; (2007), states, &quot;[i]t is now reasonably clear that the actions of Mathews and McKee in Florida and on the Gulf Coast between 1810 and 1812 departed far more from the policies of the [Madison] administration than they fairly reflected them,&quot; and additionally deems the Patriot War, &quot;an embarrassing and shameful moment in the history of early American foreign policy.&quot;

However, James G. Cusick, in &quot;The Other War of 1812&quot; (2007), states, &quot;[i]n truth, the administration&#x27;s displeasure over an attack on East Florida rested on its timing and in the unfortunate publicity it received, not on the results.&quot; G. Melvin Herndon draws a similar conclusion. In &quot;George Mathews, Frontier Patriot&quot; (1969), he states, &quot;[i]t is generally agreed that Mathews was the victim of a vacillating administration whose dictates he had served faithfully according to his own lights. He succeeded too well; and, under pressure from several sources, President Madison and Secretary Monroe deemed it necessary to sacrifice Mathews to quell the criticism of their Florida policy. Similarly, Frank Owsley, in &quot;Filibusters and Expansionists: Jeffersonian Manifest Destiny, 1800-1821&quot; states, &quot;Mathews probably interpreted Madison&#x27;s wishes accurately, and very likely had oral instructions from the government assuring him that his understanding of the orders was absolutely correct.&quot;

Paul Kruse, in &quot;A Secret Agent in East Florida: General George Mathews and the Patriot War&quot; (1952) observes that whatever Mathews&#x27; instructions, a letter from Mathews to Monroe, &quot;written more than seven months before the invasion was actually attempted, fully disclosed General Mathews&#x27; revolutionary designs upon East Florida. Not to have checked the plan on such a notice made the government a party to them.&quot; Stephen F. Knott, in &quot;Secret and Sanctioned: Covert Operations and the American Presidency&quot; (1996) states: &quot;I believe Mathews&#x27; admission that he could not achieve the seizure of East Florida without additional overt American military support pushed the administration over the edge. Months of silent acquiescence by the Madison White House came to an end.&quot;

== Physical appearance ==
Rembert Patrick describes his appearance during an 1811 meeting with James Madison as thus:
:In one hand he held his old three-cornered cocked hat; he had on worn knee breeches, high-topped boots, and a shirt with little ruffles at the bosom and wrists. A sword, the symbol of his military valor, dangled at his side. He was short, thick-set, with stout muscular legs; he stood straight with his head thrown back, his red hair wind-blown, and his dark blue eyes framed by a weathered face.

==Memorials==
Several historical markers in the United States are dedicated to George Mathews. The Battle of Point Pleasant monument and memorial in Mason County, West Virginia, lists him as a captain in the army of General Andrew Lewis. A marker stands at sight of his Georgia home, &quot;Goose Pond&quot;, in Oglethorpe County, Georgia. Another marker, in Greene County, Georgia, stands at the sight of Fort Mathews, an outpost where Thomas Houghton wrote the report to George Mathews that led to the fall of the Trans-Oconee Republic. A marker in Elbert County, Georgia, acknowledges Mathews&#x27;s role in settling of that county.

<doc id="715679" wikidata="Q1060144" url="?curid=715679" title="Gaugino">
<text>In supersymmetry theories of particle physics, a gaugino is the hypothetical fermionic supersymmetric field quantum (superpartner) of a gauge field, as predicted by gauge theory combined with supersymmetry. All gauginos have a spin of 1/2, except for the gravitino, which has a spin of 3/2.

In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model the following gauginos exist:

* The gluino (symbol ) is the superpartner of the gluon, and hence carries color charge.
* The gravitino (symbol ) is the supersymmetric partner of the graviton.
* Three winos (symbol and W͂3) are the superpartners of the W bosons of the SU(2)L gauge fields.
* The bino is the superpartner of the U(1) gauge field corresponding to weak hypercharge.

Sometimes the term &quot;electroweakinos&quot; is used to refer to winos and binos and on occasion also higgsinos. Note that in other SUSY models the zino () is the superpartner of the Z boson.

==Mixing==

Gauginos mix with higgsinos, the superpartners of the Higgs field&#x27;s degrees of freedom, to form mass eigenstates called neutralinos, which are electrically neutral, and charginos, which are electrically charged.

In many supersymmetric models, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), often a neutralino such as the photino, is stable. In that case it is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and a candidate for dark matter.

<text>Caaguazú () is a department in Paraguay. The capital is the city of Coronel Oviedo.

== History ==

In the 16th and 17th centuries, European settlers in the present-day department of Caaguazú were threatened by the Portuguese Bandeirant and Guaicurú Indians, preventing permanent settlement of the land for many years.

In the 18th century, repopulation of Caaguazu began again. In 1712, Gregorio Bazán de Pedraza founded the Villa de San Isidro Labrador de Curuguaty, followed by Ybytimí in 1715, San Joaquín in 1746, and Carayaó in 1770.

In 1906, the area was assigned the name Yhú, including the departmental capital of Yhú, Ajos (present day Coronel Oviedo), Carayaó, San Joaquín and Caaguazú. Upon territorial reorganization in 1945, it was given the name of Caaguazú.

In 1973, the present-day territory and limits of this department were defined.

Caaguazú is the home department of several Paraguayan personalities, such as the writer Mario Halley Mora and the musician Cayo Sila Godoy.

The name &quot;Caaguazú&quot; (Ka&#x27;aguazu in Guaraní) means &quot;great herb.&quot;

==Limits==

Caaguazú is located in the middle of the Oriental Region of the country, between latitudes 24º30’ and 25º50’ S and longitudes 55º00’ and 56º45’ W.

Caaguazú is bordered:
* To the north by San Pedro and Canindeyú
* To the east by Alto Paraná
* To the west by Cordillera and Paraguarí
* To the south by Guairá and Caazapá

==Districts==
The department is divided into 23 districts:

&quot;*The new district of Tembiaporá has not yet been added to the list and map since it was created recently.&quot;

==Climate==

The average climate is mild with abundant rains. The temperature reaches 41 degrees Celsius in the summer and drops to 0 degrees C in the winter. It is one of the best areas for agriculture in the country.

==Orography and Soil ==

The Cordillera de Caaguazú extends throughout the department from north to south. It is made up of the mountain ranges of San Joaquín, in San Joaquín and Yhú; Tajao Paú and Carayaó; and Caaguazú, between Carayaó and Coronel Oviedo. Peak heights are no more than 200 meters, but to the east elevations reach 250 meters.

To the west there are formations of fluvial and glacial origins that date from the Carboniferous period (Paleozoic era), with sandstone soils. To the east, the soil is also of fluvial origin, lacustrine and marine, dating to the Permian period. In the mountain range, there is sandstone from the Triassic period which contains quartz.

The soils are sandstone and basalt in addition to mountains and meadows.

The territory is made up of a succession of valleys and elevated lands that range from the north to the south. In the north, there are valleys with ample fields apt for cattle; to the east, forests and natural herbal lands predominate.

The land is commonly used for agriculture.

==Hydrography ==

The most important bodies of water that cross the department are the Paraguay River, the Tebicuary-mi River, and the streams Tapiracuai, Mbutuy, Hondo and Tobatiry. Other local rivers include the Paraná River and the Acaray, Monday-mi, Yguazú, Capiibary and Guyraungua.

==Natural Environment and Vegetation==

The Caaguazú department includes the Central Forest region, in the middle of the department, the Alto Paraná, in the east, and the Central Littoral, in the west.

The principal activity of the region is the harvesting of trees, which provides the raw material for the wood industry. Caaguzú is one of the areas that is most affected by deforestation in Paraguay. Some plant species in danger of extinction are the yvyra paje, nandyta, cedar and tumera aureli. Endangered animal species include the tirica, jaguareté, and arira’y.

==Economy==

The department of Caaguazú is the number one national producer of manioc in the country and the second in cotton and sugar cane production. The population also practices cattle rearing and the farming of other fruits vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, strawberries, and citrus fruits. Caaguazú is the fourth greatest producer of maize.

The most important industries are cotton, oil, wood industry, and the manufacturing of furniture.

The central location of Caaguazú and the siting of Coronel Oviedo and the city of Caaguazú at crossroads makes the area an important commercial center.

==Communication and Services==

The route “Gral. Aquino” (number 3) meets route “Bernardino Caballero” (number 5) in Coronel Oviedo, providing a connection to Concepción and Pedro Juan Caballero in the north of the country. The route “Dr. Blas Garay” (number 8) joins with route number 2 in Cnel. Oviedo and communicates with Villarrica and Caazapá.

There are a few runways for small airplanes in the department.

The department has phone service for more than 10,300 lines. AM radio stations include Radio Excélsior, Tajy, Coronel Oviedo, La Voz del Este, and FM radio stations include Seguritec Ingeniería S. A., Horizonte, Centenario, Lo Mita, Mensajero, Radio Clásica, América, Alborada, among others.

==Education==

There are 589 institutions of elementary education, 913 basic schools, and 151 high schools (according to the Paraguayan educational system) in the department of Caaguazú.

<text>In particle physics, the chargino is a hypothetical particle which refers to the mass eigenstates of a charged superpartner, i.e. any new electrically charged fermion (with spin 1/2) predicted by supersymmetry. They are linear combinations of the charged wino and charged higgsinos. There are two charginos that are fermions and are electrically charged, which are typically labeled (the lightest) and (the heaviest), although sometimes formula_1 and formula_2 are also used to refer to charginos, when formula_3 is used to refer to neutralinos. The heavier chargino can decay through the neutral Z boson to the lighter chargino. Both can decay through a charged W boson to a neutralino:

<doc id="715689" wikidata="Q1980388" url="?curid=715689" title="Landmarq">
<text>Landmarq (pronounced like &quot;landmark&quot;) are a British neo-prog band. Since forming in 1990, they have so far released a total of ten albums, four of which were recorded live at various concerts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, plus two full concert DVDs.

==History==
Initially signing to a Dutch record company, SI Music, then forming their own label, Synergy Records, the band have established themselves within the world of progressive rock, though their style may also extend into album-oriented rock, melodic rock, hard rock and even a slightly jazz edge.

Vocalist Damian Wilson left the band after three albums to concentrate on his solo career and the band found a replacement in Ian &#x27;Moon&#x27; Gould. He spent a year with the band, playing various gigs in the UK and the Netherlands, before deciding to move on. It was at this point that Landmarq decided to go for a radical change to their sound and recruited the long-time friend of the band, Tracy Hitchings, who formerly sang with Quasar.

Landmarq have played concerts in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Poland, Italy, the US and Mexico; both as support and as headliners at various festivals and music venues. The band have worked with many including Marillion, Focus, John Wetton, Steve Hackett, Hugh McDowell, Nik Turner, Annie Haslam IQ, Pendragon, Arena and Suzi Quatro.

Apart from making strong in-roads into Europe and America, Landmarq have reached further territories worldwide, as far afield as Russia, eastern Europe, the Far East, and Australia through various magazine/webzine articles, interviews, radio air-play and also compilation CDs from various music magazines.

The band&#x27;s first DVD was released in March 2006. Entitled &quot;Turbulence – Live In Poland&quot;, it featured Landmarq filmed in concert at the Wyspianski Theatre, Katowice, in November 2005. The DVD was released by the Polish label Metal Mind Productions. The DVD also comprised a wealth of bonus material including audio and video archive tracks, an interview with the band, and photo gallery.

Following an enforced break for a few years, Landmarq re-emerged in 2012 with the release of their fifth album, &quot;Entertaining Angels&quot;, a &#x27;Special Edition&#x27; double-CD set. This was followed up with &quot;Angels On Tour&quot;, a series of live dates through 2012-2013, that saw Landmarq performing in various festivals and venues again in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

<doc id="715690" wikidata="Q881839" url="?curid=715690" title="Caazapá Department">
<text>Caazapá () is a department in Paraguay. The capital is the city of Caazapá. Among Paraguayans, the department is well known for its orange and mandarin trees, and for its forest hills. The eastern part of Caazapá is relatively undeveloped and consists of rolling hills and large swaths of Brazilian Atlantic interior rainforest between the San Rafael mountains to the south and the Ybytyruzú mountains to the north. The western part is an area of low-lying marshes and swampland area, and consists of wetlands and tributaries to eastern Paraguay&#x27;s largest river, the Tebicuary. Many indigenous groups make their home in what remains of the rainforest, especially south of the unpaved highway between San Juan Nepomuceno and Tavaí. Mby&#x27;a and Guayaki people, who practice farming corn, cassava and yerba mate under the canopy of the forest live in small bands and travel mainly by foot. They are technically protected and their land is a national reserve, but illegal loggers, ranchers, and more recently, Brazilian soybean growers have encroached upon their territory. With Paraguay&#x27;s weak legal infrastructure, little can be done by way of enforcement or sanctions.

==Districts==

The department is divided in 11 districts:
==History==

Its history is linked to the first franciscan religious missionaries in Paraguay, who founded several mission-towns (&quot;reducciones&quot;), where they accomplished to exempt the natives of 10 years of patronage. It is one of the first missions established in Río de la Plata.

The central region of the country, such as Caazapá is the region that helped the most to consolidate and form the history of Paraguay. The presence of the Franciscans in the Missions Yuty and Caazapá is a process that started in 1607 and continued through the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1786, the Mission San Juan Nepomuceno was founded, which helped, along with other localities, to work and exploit the land.

In 1906, by law, Caazapá was constituted as the department No. 6 of Paraguay, being the city of the same name, its capital. Since 1973 the limits haven&#x27;t been modified and stay the same nowadays.

In late 19th century, Australian colonists settled in this department to found a socialist colony. Until now, descendants of those colonists live in the town. One of the most notorious personalities that are descendant of these colonists is the comic book writer Robin Wood. Other famous people from Caazapá are:

* M. D. Pedro N. Ciancio, the first pediatrician of Paraguay, and who brought to the country the first grains of soy.
* M. D. Pedro Duarte Ortellado, creator of the Ministry of Health and its first minister.
* Félix Paiva, lawyer and President of the Republic between 1937 and 1939.
* Maria Concepción Leyes de Chávez, writer.
* Miguel Ángel Pangrazio, lawyer and writer.
* Ana Iris Chávez de Ferreiro, poet and writer.
* Felipe Sosa, guitar player.
* Father José de Jesús Aguirre, writer and psychologist.
* Monsignor Saro Vera, writer.

==Geography==
===Limits===

Located south-east in the Oriental Región of Paraguay, between parallels 25° 30&#x27; and 26° 45&#x27; of latitude South, and between the meridians 55° 15&#x27; and 56° 45&#x27; of longitude West.

To the North, it limits with the Guairá and Caaguazú departments

To the South with Itapúa,

To the East with Alto Paraná and

To the West with Misiones and Paraguarí.

===Climate===

The highest temperatures reach 37 °C and the lowest drop to 1 °C, the average is 21 °C. It is one of the departments with more quantity of precipitation.

===Orography and soil===

The soil is composed by sandstone from the Carboniferous period, of fluvial and glacial origin. The land form low hills with no more than 200 meters in height and rise towards the Ybyturuzú Cordillera.

The Caazapá Cordillera, Monte Rosario and San Rafael chain of mountains cross throughout the department from East to West, with some hills of medium high such as Mbatovi, Ñú Cañy, Pacurí and Morotí. This cordillera separates the land in two different regions, to the north-east, there are meadows, lagoons, swamps and fields for agriculture; to the south-east there are hills and forests.

===Hydrography===

The Tebicuary River crosses the department from East to West, also the South of the department and serves as limit with Itapúa department. The Tebicuary-mi River serves as limit with Paraguarí.

The Pirapó River flows into the Tebiacuary River, in the center area of the department. In Caazapá are the sources of two streams, Capiíbary and Ypety.

The streams Iñaro, Guazú and Charará are located in the territory of Caazapá as well.

===Natural environment and vegetation===

The natural environment of the region and all along the Caaguazú Cordillera is great example of the vast vegetation in the country.

The whole department is in the Central Forest Region. The wooded landscape has suffered the consequences of being used for breeding cattle and the abused of technology that affects the soil, being both situations a problem for the natural environment in this area.

There are some vegetable species that are in danger, such as yvyra paje, yvyra asy and nandyta. Among the animal species in danger are the tiririca, margay, lobopé and aira’y.

The protected areas are:

– Caaguazú National Park, with 16,000 hectares.
– Golondrina Private Reserve, with 24,077 hectares.

==Tourism==

The Franciscan Museum is a much visited place by the tourists. Also, the Ykua Bolaños, which is a spring with a particular legend. The legend tells that a Priest, Luis de Bolaños, wanting to convince the natives of the existence of God, hit the rock and the water surged; creating a miracle that would convince them.

In the city Maciel, there is an old train station.

The hills Mbatovi, Ñu Cañy, Pacuri and the Serranía del Rosario, are also very attractive for the tourists.

The rivers Tebicuary, Tebicuary-mi, Pirapó and Capiibary are interesting recreational places to go swimming.

==Economy==

Caazapá produces cotton, soy, sweet, cane, corn and manioc. The production of soy grains is so abundant that this department is called “The Farm of the Oriental Region”.

The forestall exploit was a great part of the department&#x27;s economic activity 30 years ago, but has diminished in the later years.

There are not much industries in the region, but the ones that are, dedicate to processing of food, honey, sweet cane and starch.

==Communication and services==

The most important way of access to the department is Route No. 8 “Dr. Blas Garay”, which joins the routes No 2 and 7 in Coronel Oviedo. It communicates Caazapá with the rest of the country.

The railway Carlos Antonio López used to cross the department from North to South, 96 kilometers of extension, and included the road San Salvador – Abaí.

The rivers that bathe Caazapá are navigable for small ships. The department also has airstrips for small and medium planes.

Caazapá also has several television and radio stations, such as Hechizo SRL, in AM and Yeruti Comunicaciones, Itacurú SRL, La Voz de Bolaños, Caazapá Poty, Tupa Renda, La Victoria SA, Aguaí Poty and 94.3 in FM.

There are 28.276 housings in the department, 5.765 in the urban area and 22.511 in the rural area. The percentage of which count with basic facilities are the following:

Electrical power: 16,1%
Running water: 5,8%
Trash recollection: 0,3%

==Education==
Caazapá has 205 educational institutions, 402 elemental schools and 51 high schools.

<text>In particle physics, for models with &quot;N&quot; = 1 supersymmetry, a higgsino, symbol , is the superpartner of the Higgs field. A higgsino is a Dirac fermionic field with spin and it refers to a weak isodoublet with hypercharge half under the Standard Model gauge symmetries. After electroweak symmetry breaking higgsino fields linearly mix with U(1) and SU(2) gauginos leading to four neutralinos and two charginos that refer to physical particles. While the two charginos are charged Dirac fermions (plus and minus each), the neutralinos are electrically neutral Majorana fermions. In an R-parity-conserving version of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the lightest neutralino typically becomes the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The LSP is a particle physics candidate for the dark matter of the universe since it cannot decay to particles with lighter mass. A neutralino LSP, depending on its composition can be bino, wino or higgsino dominated in nature and can have different zones of mass values in order to satisfy the estimated dark matter relic density. Commonly, a higgsino dominated LSP is often referred as a higgsino, in spite of the fact that a higgsino is not a physical state in the true sense.

In natural scenarios of SUSY, top squarks, bottom squarks, gluinos, and higgsino-enriched neutralinos and charginos are expected to be relatively light, enhancing their production cross sections. Higgsino searches have been performed by both the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where physicists have searched for the direct electroweak pair production of Higgsinos. As of 2017, no experimental evidence for Higgsinos has been reported.

== Mass ==
If dark matter is composed only of Higgsinos, then the Higgsino mass is 1.1 TeV. On the other hand, if dark matter has multiple components, then the Higgsino mass depends on the relevant multiverse distribution functions, making the mass of the Higgsino lighter.
: mħ ≈ 1.1 (Ωħ/ΩDM)1/2 TeV

<doc id="715692" wikidata="Q1306766" url="?curid=715692" title="Daniel Barringer (geologist)">
<text>Daniel Barringer (May 25, 1860 – November 30, 1929) was a geologist best known as the first person to prove the existence of an impact crater on the Earth, Meteor Crater in Arizona. The site has been renamed the Barringer Crater in his honor, which is the preferred name used in the scientific community. A small lunar crater on the far side of the Moon is also named after him.

== Early life ==
Daniel Barringer was the son of Daniel Moreau Barringer, a nephew of Confederate General Rufus Barringer and a cousin of Paul Brandon Barringer. He graduated from Princeton University in 1879 at the age of 19, and in 1882 graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law. He later studied geology and mineralogy at Harvard University and at the University of Virginia, respectively.

In 1892, Barringer, along with his friend Richard A. F. Penrose, Jr., and others, purchased a gold and silver mine near Cochise, Arizona. Later, Barringer also discovered the Commonwealth Silver Mine in Pearce, Arizona. These mining ventures made him wealthy.

==Meteor Crater==
In 1902 Barringer learned of the existence of a large (1.5 km in diameter) crater, located 35 miles east of Flagstaff, Arizona. The crater, now called Meteor Crater, had previously been studied by the geologist Grove Karl Gilbert in 1891. Gilbert had hypothesized that the crater must have been the result of either a gas explosion or a meteorite. After performing experiments in the crater, however, Gilbert&#x27;s conclusion was that the crater could not be the result of an impact, and therefore could only be the result of an explosion. He concluded this despite the clear presence of thousands of small meteoritic particles in the vicinity of the crater.

Upon hearing of the existence of the crater and the meteoritic iron, Barringer became convinced that the crater was of meteoritic origin. With both scientific and monetary aims in mind, Barringer created the &quot;Standard Iron Company&quot; in order to mine the crater for the iron that he assumed must be buried below its surface. The Standard Iron Company conducted drilling operations in and around the crater between 1903 and 1905, and concluded that the crater had indeed been caused by a violent impact. It was unable to find the meteorite, however.

== Scientific results ==
In 1906, Barringer and his partner, the mathematician and physicist Benjamin C. Tilghman, presented their first papers to the U.S. Geological Survey outlining the evidence in support of the impact theory. The papers were published in the &quot;Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences&quot; in Philadelphia.

By the late 1920s, Barringer had convinced most of the scientific community that his impact theory was correct. The theory has been further confirmed with new evidence since then, most notably by Eugene Shoemaker during the 1960s.

The mining of the crater continued until 1929 without ever finding the ten-million ton meteorite that Barringer assumed must be hidden. By this point Barringer had spent over $600,000 with no iron profits to show for it, nearly bankrupting him. At this time the astronomer Forest Ray Moulton performed calculations on the energy expended by the meteorite on impact, and concluded that the meteorite had most likely vaporized when it landed.

== Death ==
Barringer died of a heart attack on November 30, 1929, shortly after reading the very persuasive arguments that no iron was to be found. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Bennett, and eight children, who, with their descendants, formed the Barringer Crater Company, which owns the site to this day as a family business.

== Legacy ==
In honor of Daniel Barringer’s memory, in 1982 the Meteoritical Society established an award, the Barringer Medal, given at the Meteoritical Society annual meeting, to recognize outstanding work in the field of impact crater research which is sponsored by the Barringer Crater Company. In addition, in 2002 as a memorial to Daniel Barringer and his sons’ contributions to the field of impact crater research, the Barringer Crater Company established the Barringer Family Fund for Meteorite Impact Research to support field work by eligible students on the study of impact cratering processes.

<doc id="715693" wikidata="Q963636" url="?curid=715693" title="Tshwa language">
<text>Tsoa, Tshwa or Tshuwau, also known as Kua and Hiechware, is an East Kalahari Khoe dialect cluster spoken by several thousand people in Botswana and Zimbabwe. 

One of the dialects is Tjwao (formerly spelled &#x27;Tshwao&#x27;), the only Khoisan language in Zimbabwe, where &quot;Koisan&quot; is a language officially recognised in the constitution.

==Dialects==
Tsoa–Kua is a dialect cluster, which is still poorly studied but seems to include: 
*Tsoa, also known as Hiechware and as various other combinations of Hio-, Hie-, Hai- + Chwa, Tshwa, Chuwau, Tshuwau + -re, -ri; also as Sarwa, Sesarwa (the Tswana name), Gǁabakʼe-Ntshori, Tati, and Kwe-Etshori Kwee. Zimbabwean Tjwao apparently belongs here.
*Kua, also spelled Cua and Tyhua. That is, both Tsoa and Kua may be pronounced something like , and it&#x27;s not clear that they are distinct dialects.
*Cire Cire , spoken in the area around Nata in Botswana.

==Phonology==
The following inventory is of the Kua dialect:

The Cire-cire (not cited) dialect has the following consonant inventory:

The clicks have a very uneven distribution: Only a dozen words begin with one of the palatal clicks (), and these are replaced by dental clicks () among younger speakers. Only half a dozen words start with one of the alveolar clicks (), and half a dozen more with one of the affricated clicks. These rather marginal sounds are placed in parentheses in the chart.

Tsoa has the five vowels , and three nasal vowels . It is not clear if Tsoa has long vowels, or simply sequences of identical vowels .

There are two tones, high and low, plus a few cases of mid tone.

In the northern dialect of Kua, like all other East Kalahari Khoe languages, the palatal click series has become palatal stops. Southern Kua has retained the palatal clicks, but the dental stops have palatalized, as they have in Gǀui and ǂʼAmkoe. Thus northern Kua has &#x27;ash&#x27; and &#x27;eland&#x27;, whereas southern Kua has &#x27;ash&#x27; and (or perhaps ) &#x27;eland&#x27;.

<text>Canindeyú () is a department in Paraguay. The capital is the city of Salto del Guairá.
Canindeyú comes from the Guarani words Kaninde - macaw; ju - yellow, blue-and-yellow macaw (&quot;Ara ararauna&quot;).

==Districts==

The department is divided in 16 districts:

# Corpus Christi
# Curuguaty
# General Francisco Caballero Alvarez (Puente Kyhá)
# Itanará
# Katueté
# La Paloma
# Nueva Esperanza
# Salto del Guairá
# Villa Ygatimí
# Yasy Cañy
# Ypehú
# Ybyrarobaná
# Yby Pytá
#Maracanà
#Puerto Adela

<text>YPF S.A. (, formerly ; English: &quot;Fiscal Oilfields&quot;) is a vertically integrated, majority state-owned Argentine energy company, engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, and the transportation, refining, and marketing of gas and petroleum products. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, YPF was ranked as the 1360th -largest public company in the world.

Founded in 1922 under President Hipólito Yrigoyen&#x27;s administration, YPF was the first oil company established as a state enterprise outside of the Soviet Union, and the first state oil company to become vertically integrated.

YPF&#x27;s first director was Enrique Mosconi, who took up his charge in 1922, remaining there until 1930. During his run on the company, Mosconi advocated economic independence and starting in 1928, nationalization of oil supplies; the latter, however, was never achieved due to a 1930 military coup against Yrigoyen backed by, among others, foreign oil interests.

YPF was privatized under president Carlos Menem and was bought by the Spanish firm Repsol in 1999; the resulting merged company was called Repsol YPF.

The renationalization of 51% of the firm was initiated in 2012 by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The government of Argentina eventually agreed to pay $5 billion compensation to Repsol.

According to Bloomberg, the board of directors include Matteo Reggio and Miguel Gutiérrez.

== History ==

===Early development===

The company, specializing in the exploration, production, refining and commercialization of petroleum, had its origin in 1907, when oil was discovered near the city of Comodoro Rivadavia in Chubut. Following World War I, oil had become an important resource, leading to struggles between rival powers to gain control of it.

YPF was created by President of Argentina Hipólito Yrigoyen on 3 June 1922. It was the first entirely state-run oil company in the world, the second being the French &quot;Compagnie française des pétroles&quot; (CFP, French Company of Petroleum), created in 1924 by the conservative Prime Minister Raymond Poincaré. YPF&#x27;s creation was followed by the creation of ANCAP in Uruguay (1931), YPFB in Bolivia (1936), Pemex in Mexico (1938), ENAP in Chile (1950), and Petrobras in Brazil (1953). Mosconi served as YPF&#x27;s first director.

YPF bought its first tanker in the United States in 1923, and built not only several extracting facilities, but whole towns and cities, such as Comodoro Rivadavia; Caleta Olivia in Santa Cruz; Plaza Huincul in Neuquén; and General Mosconi in Salta. Bolstered by production in Comodoro Rivadavia, the firm produced 2.2 million barrels in its first year of operation (1922); this represented over three-quarters of domestic production and nearly a fourth of Argentina&#x27;s oil consumption that year. Contracts signed in 1923 with Bethlehem Steel allowed YPF to begin the production of gasoline and kerosene.
Mosconi, who had previously been in charge of the Aeronautics division of the Army, proposed to Joaquín Corvalán, governor of Salta Province, the exploitation of Salta&#x27;s oil by YPF, offering 13% royalties for the province. Corvalán, allied with the Standard Oil of New Jersey, rejected Mosconi&#x27;s proposal, however, referring to the concept of &quot;provincial autonomy&quot;. This refusal led Mosconi to evolve in favor of the nationalization of oil supplies in order to strengthen Argentina&#x27;s independence.

The first YPF oil refinery was inaugurated in December 1925 in La Plata, and was at the time the tenth largest in the world. According to Mosconi, this spawned the beginning of &quot;the mobilization of all sort of resistance and obstacles&quot; from the oil trusts, in particular from Standard Oil, which was one of the most influential foreign companies in Argentina, with a presence in Comodoro Rivadavia, Jujuy, and Salta.

The Chamber of Deputies approved a law on 28 September 1928, establishing a state monopoly on oil. The monopoly, however, was not absolute, being limited to oil exploration, exploitation and transport, but excluding selling and imports. Private firms opposed themselves to the law project, refusing to pay a 10% royalty. The bill was supported by President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear but was ultimately blocked by the conservatives in the Senate.

Oil nationalization became an important theme of Yrigoyen&#x27;s electoral campaign of 1928, although the &quot;Yrigoyenistas&quot; focused their criticism on Standard Oil of New Jersey, abstaining themselves from attacking British Empire interests, to which Argentina&#x27;s economy was closely linked (in particular Royal Dutch Shell).
Following Yrigoyen&#x27;s victory in the 1928 elections, YPF, still directed by Enrique Mosconi, reduced oil prices in May 1929, leading to the cheapest petroleum in the world and to an important increase in YPF&#x27;s sales compared to its rival private companies, forcing them to also lower their prices. Mosconi also reduced the price of kerosene and agrochemicals to contribute to the development of the interior regions of Argentina. YPF produced 5.5 million barrels by 1929, and though its share of domestic output had declined to 58% (from 77% in 1923) amid a sharp rise of Esso and Royal Dutch Shell production in Chubut, the firm now covered a third of the nation&#x27;s oil market. A partnership with distributor Auger &amp; Co. signed in 1925 resulted in a network of over 700 filling stations selling 178 million liters (47 million gallons) by 1930 – an 18% market share. Company revenues in 1930 reached US$25 million.

The Petroleum Institute (&quot;Instituto del Petróleo&quot;) was created on 30 December 1929, and directed by Ricardo Rojas, the rector of the University of Buenos Aires. Foreseeing conflicts with US private companies, Mosconi proposed an agreement with the Soviet state company Amtorg, which was to allow Argentina to import 250,000 tons of petroleum each year, paid by trade with leather, wool, tannin and mutton. The agreement was to be made official in September 1930, along with the complete nationalization of oil resources; but on 6 September 1930, Yrigoyen was deposed by a military coup headed by General José Félix Uriburu, and the project was withdrawn.

===Energy self-sufficiency===

The coup was lobbied for chiefly by Standard Oil, whose interests in Salta Province and neighboring Bolivia conflicted with those of YPF. The subsequent Concordance regime supported YPF, however, and its role as the nation&#x27;s leading oil distillates retailer was bolstered by a 1936 agreement with the Automóvil Club Argentino (ACA) to supply a chain of ACA service stations. Oil production by YPF continued to grow, and soon eclipsed private production: from just over 5 million barrels (37% of the total) in 1934, production grew to 15 million in 1945 (67%). The development of the nation&#x27;s sizable natural gas resources also originated largely from YPF. Drawing from an initiative by YPF director Julio Canessa, President Juan Perón ordered that the gas flared off in YPF oil extraction should instead be captured, and sold by a state company, thus establishing the sister firm &quot;Gas del Estado&quot; (&quot;State Gas&quot;) in 1946. The nation&#x27;s first gas compressor and what at the time was the world&#x27;s longest gas pipeline were completed by 1949, leading to a fifty-fold increase in natural gas production. Oil production at YPF surpassed 25 million barrels (84% of the nation&#x27;s total) by 1955.
This gain was partly offset by a 40% drop in private-sector output, however, such that overall oil production rose by only one-third during the Peronist decade while annual consumption nearly doubled to 70 million barrels. The nation&#x27;s oil supply thus shifted from 60% domestic in 1945, to 60% imported by 1954. Oil imports by 1955 rose to US$300 million, or over one fourth of total merchandise imports. Perón had made economic nationalism a policy centerpiece. YPF was granted an exemption from steep oil import tariffs levied on private firms, and Article 40 of the Constitution of 1949 stipulated the nationalization of all energy and mineral resources. The deteriorating oil deficit led Perón to court foreign investment in the sector as early as 1947, however, when an oil drilling contract was signed by YPF with U.S. firm Drilexco. Total exploration doubled, and significant reserves in Salta Province were developed. A more controversial joint venture with Standard Oil of California was signed in 1955 for the eventual production of up to 56 million barrels a year. These initiatives were opposed by much of the Army, the opposition UCR, and among others Perón&#x27;s point man on national oil policy, YPF head Julio Canessa, who was dismissed. The venture ended following Perón&#x27;s overthrow in September.
An erstwhile critic of both the Drilexco and Standard Oil contracts, President Arturo Frondizi enacted policies in 1958 which granted foreign firms rental contracts by YPF over new wells to foster exploration and production. A key part of the developmentalist economic policy advanced by Frondizi, this policy was made with the caveat that oil and gas resources themselves would be renationalized. Thirteen contracts were signed with mainly U.S. firms, whereby each contractor would earn 40% of the revenues produced from the new wells. Private production, which had virtually ceased, grew to become one third of the nation&#x27;s total. YPF itself benefited by way of a royalty bonanza, which financed record investments. These in turn led a doubling of YPF production to 65 million barrels; including the private sector, Argentina&#x27;s oil production thus nearly tripled to 98 million barrels by 1962, and despite higher consumption, imports fell to merely one sixth of total demand.

These contracts created a controversy referred to by Frondizi himself as the &quot;oil battle,&quot; and were ultimately cancelled by President Arturo Illia in 1963 over concerns that YPF would be deprived of adequate returns for its exploration investments; of the foreign firms which had taken part in the 1958 bids, only Amoco remained. The cancellations cost US$50 million in indemnity payments, though they proved fortuitous after the company&#x27;s discovery of the &quot;Puesto Hernández&quot; field in 1965. Puesto Hernández, near Rincón de los Sauces, Neuquén Province, was later declared the &quot;national energy capital&quot; due to its having at the time around half of Argentina&#x27;s reserves of oil and natural gas. This discovery allowed YPF output to rise by 50% between 1965 and 1968 to 95 million barrels, its share of the nation&#x27;s oil output growing from two-thirds to three-fourths. New oil field rental contracts were signed following a 1967 policy change enacted by President Juan Carlos Onganía which had the goal of achieving self-sufficiency in oil by 1975. Regaining its monopoly on oil imports in 1971 (which still averaged around 15 million barrels), YPF retained a majority of production (75%), as well as refining and distribution (60%), of petroleum in Argentina. The firm operated 7 refineries and 3,000 service stations by 1977, while production reached 118 million barrels.

===Decline and privatization===

Perón&#x27;s return to Argentina and to the presidency in 1973 was followed by the addition of nearly 20,000 employees (YPF employed 53,000 by 1976). It also coincided with the 1973 oil shock, however, and the US$470 million in added oil import costs combined with larger payrolls to erase profits in 1974, while production declined slightly. The dictatorship installed in a March 1976 coup initially presided over a revitalization and streamlining of YPF. Output increased by 20% and its finances initially improved following a wave of layoffs that returned employment levels to around 35,000 by 1979.

The military government was openly hostile to YPF&#x27;s paramount position in the oil industry, however. The company lost money every year after 1975 and by 1981 was US$4.1 billion in debt. YPF losses resulted, at least in large part, from policy decisions beyond its control. Government policy after 1976 kept oil prices well below inflation, with the consequence that costs increased faster than income. YPF also bore an extremely heavy tax burden, as 68.4% of its revenues were paid as tax to the national and provincial governments, as well as a long list of state agencies that included the National Energy Fund, the National Highway Council, and the Provincial Road Fund. Another serious drain resulted from the failure of other state enterprises such as Argentine Railways and the national airline to pay YPF for their fuel in full and on time. These intergovernmental accounts represented 20% of YPF&#x27;s sales and were as much as ten years in arrears. The tax policy of the military government followed the same path as its civilian predecessors, a path that regarded YPF as a convenient source of funds to ease the country&#x27;s chronic and serious fiscal deficit position.

The death in a helicopter crash of the firm&#x27;s director, Raúl Ondarts, and the appointment of General Guillermo Suárez Mason in 1981 was followed by a period of severe mismanagement, moreover. Powerful as head of the First Army Corps (which committed many of the &quot;Dirty War&quot; atrocities), Suárez Mason installed many of his hard-line Army Intelligence colleagues in managerial posts at YPF. They in turn diverted large quantities of fuel into the director&#x27;s newly established company &quot;Sol Petróleo&quot;, a dummy corporation used by Suárez Mason and his appointees for embezzlement as well as to divert funds to the Contras and the fascist organization P2 (to which the director belonged).

Suárez Mason had YPF borrow heavily not only to cover such asset stripping but also at the behest of Economy Minister José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, whose bid for currency strength and policy of financial deregulation required a sharp rise in foreign debt to maintain. YPF debts thus rose 142-fold during Suárez Mason&#x27;s tenure, at the end of which in 1983 the company recorded a US$6 billion loss (the largest in the world at the time).

YPF nonetheless remained the 365th largest firm in the world, with sales of over US$4 billion in 1992. Argentine President Carlos Menem initiated the privatization of YPF through an IPO on the New York and other stock exchanges on 28 June 1993, at a value of US$3 billion for stock equal to a 45% share in the company. During the 18 months prior to the IPO, YPF underwent a massive restructuring process led by its new CEO José Estenssoro, who had been appointed by President Menem. The staff of YPF was reduced from 52,000 to 10,600 through layoffs agreed with unions and outsourcing of services to companies established by former YPF employees during the restructuring process. The financial bottom line for the company was increased from a loss about $1 billion in 1991 (although the accounting system at the time could not accurately compute actual profit) to a profit of $1 billion in 1993, and the underlying value of YPF was increased from about US$2 billion to the US$9 billion after privatization.

Estenssoro stayed on as CEO, and further streamlined the company while expanding its reach outside Argentina, acquiring Maxus Energy Corporation of Dallas for US$740 million in 1995. Estenssoro died in a plane crash in Ecuador, where Maxus maintained wells, in May of that year. His policy of high exploration investments was maintained by his successor, Nells León, and reserves expanded by 50% while production rose from 109 million barrels in 1993 to a record 190 million in 1998; of the latter total, 32 million were produced by Maxus operations in Ecuador and elsewhere.

===Repsol acquisition===
Madrid-based multinational corporation Repsol purchased 98% of YPF in 1999 in two stages: a 15% share sold by the national government for US$2 billion, and a further 83% for over US$13 billion including all remaining public sector shares (10%, equally divided between the nation and the provinces) as well as most of the outstanding investor shares. The union of the two companies took on the name Repsol YPF; YPF would represent 40% of the new firm&#x27;s reserves and over 50% of its production.

The Petersen Group (property of the Eskenazi family of Buenos Aires) entered into a partnership with Repsol in 2007 by acquiring a 15% stake in YPF; the group bought another 10% of the company for US$1.3 billion on 4 May 2011. A majority of the firm&#x27;s shares (58%) remained under the control of Repsol, while 16% remained in private portfolios; the Argentine Government retained the golden share. In 2014, Repsol exited the Argentine market, giving up its stake in YPF.

===Renationalization===

Argentine international energy trade recorded an imbalance of US$3 billion in 2011, the first negative figure since 1987, and the relationship between YPF and the government became difficult. Investment in exploration at YPF as a percentage of profits had been far below those in most other Repsol subsidiaries. Market analysts and Repsol blamed the decline in exploration and production on government controls on exports and prospecting lease awards, and price controls on domestic oil and gas. Political risks and government intervention, including price controls, have discouraged foreign investment in oil production in Latin America in general. President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner raised YPF frequently in speeches during March 2012, claiming that underinvestment and excessive dividends at the firm had caused declines in output. Governors in six fossil-fuel producing provinces subsequently revoked YPF leases representing a fifth of its oil production.
Citing Brazilian oil giant Petrobras as an example, the president announced the introduction of a bill on 16 April 2012, for the renationalization of YPF: the national government would purchase a controlling 51% share, with ten provincial governments receiving the remaining 49%. Planning Minister Julio de Vido was appointed to head the Federal intervention, replacing CEO Sebastián Eskenazi. Repsol YPF CEO Antonio Brufau, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, and other Spanish officials objected to the nationalisation, accusing the Argentine government of driving down YPF shares ahead of the announcement (market price of the shares declined by over half from February to April). Economy Minister Hernán Lorenzino claimed in turn that asset stripping at YPF had financed Repsol&#x27;s expansion in other parts of the world.

Responses included a diplomatic offensive by Rajoy in other countries in the region, assurances by Industry Minister José Manuel Soria of &quot;clear and decisive&quot; Spanish government measures, Foreign Minister José García-Margallo y Marfil&#x27;s admonition that Argentina had &quot;shot itself in the foot&quot; by damaging relations with Spain, and other threats.

The Chinese state oil concern, Sinopec, was reported to have been in talks to buy out Repsol&#x27;s share in YPF – a potential deal scuttled by the Argentine announcement. Both Repsol and YPF shares fell sharply before and after the announcement, and the cost of insuring Argentine government bonds against default rose, as did those of Spain. Repsol Chairman Brufau estimated the company&#x27;s potential loss at €5.7 billion (US$7.5 billion).

The largest minority shareholder, the Petersen Group, had financed their initial purchase of 15% of the stock with a vendor&#x27;s loan from Repsol for €1.5 billion. The 2008 agreement required Repsol to buy back shares owned by the Group and to assume the loan should the Madrid-based firm lose majority control of YPF. Sebastián Eskenazi indicated however that the group would forgo this option.

The Senate of Argentina approved the takeover on 26 April with 63 votes in favor of the measure, three opposing it and four abstentions. The Chamber of Deputies in turn approved the bill on 4 May with 208 votes out of 257 and six abstentions. The president signed the renationalization into law on 5 May. Miguel Galluccio, an Argentine petroleum engineer with experience at both YPF and at oilfield services leader Schlumberger as president of its production management division in London, was appointed CEO.

Argentine Deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof rejected Repsol&#x27;s initial demands for payment of US$10.5 billion for a 57% stake in YPF (the state sought 51%), citing debts of nearly US$9 billion. The book value of YPF was US$4.4 billion at the end of 2011; its total market capitalization on the day of the announcement was US$10.4 billion. Repsol officials submitted the matter to the World Bank ICISD for arbitration. The Argentine government and Repsol reached agreement in principle on compensation in November 2013, and on 25 February 2014, Repsol announced final agreement that the Argentine government would provide Repsol with guaranteed Argentine government bonds of varying maturities, the nominal amount varying to assure that Repsol would in fact receive US$5 billion in compensation for the 51% of YPF nationalized. 
YPF also acquired a controlling stake in Metrogas (the nation&#x27;s largest gas distributor) in November 2012. A joint exploratory venture for the development of tight oil and shale gas at the &quot;Vaca Muerta&quot; field was signed with Chevron Corporation on 16 July 2013. Following its renationalization, rapidly rising investment levels at YPF have been funded mostly via internal financing, by Chevron, and by the periodic issuance of high-yield corporate bonds. These bond issuances were raised to US$1.5 billion per series in April 2015, as demand surged to US$4 billion.

In December 2019, the recently inaugurated President Alberto Fernández put Guillermo Nielsen in charge of YPF. Nielsen was replaced by Pablo Gerardo González in January 2021.

===Reprivatization plans===

President-elect Javier Milei stated after his election in 2023 that YPF was one of the state-controlled companies that he planned to privatize.

==Operations==

The company remained the largest in its sector in Argentina despite declining production, operating 52% of the nation&#x27;s refinery capacity in three facilities and 1,600 filling stations. Its sales of gasoline and other motor fuels totaled 12.15 billion liters (3.21 billion gallons) in 2011, 57% of the national market in these.

Oil production in Argentina peaked in 1998 at 308 million barrels and declined steadily afterward, reaching 209 million in 2011. Natural gas production also declined, from 52 billion m3 in 2004 to 45.5 billion. The company&#x27;s production of oil had fallen by 43% between 1998 and 2011, and of natural gas by 37% from its high in 2004. Oil exploration fell from 30 wells in 1998 to 8 in 2010 (French energy firm Total S.A. overtook YPF as the leading oil driller in Argentina).

YPF shares of total output fell 8 points to 34% in oil, and 12 points to 23% in natural gas; its declines in output represented 54% of lost oil production and 97% in the case of natural gas. The company&#x27;s oil production had declined by a further 7%, and gas by 9%, during 2011. Production declines of 6% annually under Repsol were reversed following the renationalization, however. Amid sharp increases in profitability and investment, output in 2013 rose by 3.4% in oil and a 2.2% in gas, and a further 8.7% and 12.5% in oil and gas, respectively, during 2014.

YPF announced the discovery in November 2011 of an 8071 km2 unconventional oil field, &quot;Vaca Muerta&quot;, with recoverable reserves of 22.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and potential to extend to an area of up to 30,000 km2 (11,600 mi2). Its reserves of crude and natural gas, not including the new shale finds, fell 60% and 67% respectively between 1999 and 2011.

The firm&#x27;s new headquarters, the Repsol-YPF Tower, was designed by César Pelli and inaugurated in 2008.

<text>In geometry, the gyroelongated square bipyramid is a polyhedron with 16 triangular faces. it can be constructed from a square antiprism by attaching two equilateral square pyramids to each of its square faces. The same shape is also called hexakaidecadeltahedron, heccaidecadeltahedron, or tetrakis square antiprism; these last names mean a polyhedron with 16 triangular faces. It is an example of deltahedron, and of a Johnson solid.

The dual polyhedron of the gyroelongated square bipyramid is a square truncated trapezohedron with eight pentagons and two squares as its faces. The gyroelongated square pyramid appears in chemistry as the basis for the bicapped square antiprismatic molecular geometry, and in mathematical optimization as a solution to the Thomson problem.

== Construction ==
Like other gyroelongated bipyramids, the gyroelongated square bipyramid can be constructed by attaching two equilateral square pyramids onto the square faces of a square antiprism; this process is known as gyroelongation. These pyramids cover each square, replacing it with four equilateral triangles, so that the resulting polyhedron has 16 equilateral triangles as its faces. A polyhedron with only equilateral triangles as faces is called a deltahedron. There are only eight different convex deltahedra, one of which is the gyroelongated square bipyramid. More generally, the convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular is the Johnson solid, and every convex deltahedron is a Johnson solid. The gyroelongated square bipyramid is numbered among the Johnson solids as formula_1.

One possible system of Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a gyroelongated square bipyramid, giving it edge length 2, is:
formula_2

== Properties ==
The surface area of a gyroelongated square bipyramid is 16 times the area of an equilateral triangle, that is:
formula_3
and the volume of a gyroelongated square bipyramid is obtained by slicing it into two equilateral square pyramids and one square antiprism, and then adding their volume:
formula_4
It has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the square antiprism, the dihedral group of formula_5 of order 8. Its dihedral angle is similar to the gyroelongated square pyramid, by calculating the sum of the equilateral square pyramid and the square antiprism&#x27;s angle in the following:
* the dihedral angle of an equilateral square pyramid between two adjacent triangles, approximately formula_6
* the dihedral angle of a square antiprism between two adjacent triangles, approximately formula_7
* the dihedral angle between two adjacent triangles, on the edge where an equilateral square pyramid is attached to a square antiprism, is formula_8, for which by adding the dihedral angles between a square and a triangle of both the pyramid and the antiprism.

The dual polyhedron of a gyroleongated square bipyramid is the square truncated trapezohedron. It has eight pentagons and two squares.

== Application ==
Gyroelongated square bipyramid can be visualized in the geometry of chemical compounds as the atom cluster surrounding a central atom as a polyhedron, and the compound of such cluster is the bicapped square antiprismatic molecular geometry. It has 10 vertices and 24 edges, corresponding to the &quot;closo&quot; polyhedron with formula_9 skeletal electrons. An example is nickel carbonyl carbide anion , a 22 skeletal electron chemical compound with ten vertices and the deficiency of two carbon monoxides.

The Thomson problem concerning the minimum-energy configuration of formula_10 charged particles on a sphere. The minimum solution known for formula_11 places the points at the vertices of a gyroelongated square bipyramid, inscribed in a sphere.

<text>Central () is a department in Paraguay. The capital is Areguá. With 1,883,927 inhabitants, it is the most populated of the 17 departments of Paraguay. It is also the smallest department, with a total area of .

==Geography==
The mountainous area of Altos and the bodies of water including the Paraguay and the Salado rivers, the lakes Ypacaraí and Ypoá, and the pond Cabral are part of the natural limits in Central. The potential resources of this region, along with other regions in the south section, contribute to diverse activities such as tourism and agriculture.

===Boundaries===
*North: the departments of Cordillera and Presidente Hayes
*West: the Argentine province of Formosa separated by the Paraguay River, and the capital district, Asunción
*East: the department of Paraguarí
*South: the department of Ñeembucú

===Districts===
The department is divided in 19 districts:


===Climate===

The maximum temperatures are in the summer, reaching 40 °C and higher. In the winter, the minimum temperature is 0 °C. The annual average temperature is 22 °C. Rains vary approximately 1433 mm per year. The period between the months of January and February is the wettest, and the driest period is during the months of June and August.

===Hydrology===

The department is mainly watered by the Paraguay River and its affluents: the Salado River, which is flowed by the Ypacaraí Lake and the streams Itay, Paray e Ytororó.
The streams Yuquyry and Ñanduá drain into the Ypoá wetlands.
The lakes Ypacaraí, Ypoá and the lagoon Cabral are situated in this region of the country.

===Orography===

The spurs of the Ybytypanema, part of the Los Altos chain, are in this department. Its highest hills are Lambaré, Ñanduá and Arrua-í. Other, lower hills in the zone are the Ñemby and the Patiño.

==History==

The Central Department, known as “Comarca Asuncena”, is historically the most populated region in the country.
During the colonization of Paraguay, this region was the center from where new foundations were expanded, as well as refuge of settlers who were escaping from the attacks of the Guaicurú Indians.

The towns in this department have various origins. One of the main figures of these foundations was Domingo Martínez de Irala, who gave rise to the districts of Itá and Areguá. The town of Luque was established as a Spanish village. Villeta and Tapuá, nowadays called Mariano Roque Alonso were founded in order to establish military forts for defence.

Others tows like Capiatá and Itauguá were expanded around chapels used as evangelization centers. The towns in the department are bound, partly, due to the Chaqueños Indians’ resistance against the Spanish conquest of their lands, which forced the settlers to emigrate and take refuge in this part of the region. That was how villages including Guarambaré, Ypané and Ñemby were established.

The towns of Nueva Italia, Colonia Thompson and Villa Elisa had a different origin, established as agricultural colonies in the 19th century and beginnings of the 20th, and mainly settled by foreign immigrants.

By 1985, the last district in the Central Department, Juan Augusto Saldívar, had been established.

==Transportation==
===Routes===
By being part of the metropolitan area of the country&#x27;s capital, this department has many routes. Most of the routes of the country leave from Asunción to the country towns.

National route PY01 links the capital city with southern Paraguay; PY02 connects the capital with eastern Paraguay, which borders Brazil; PY03 connects this metro area with the northern departments, while PY19 connects it primarily with western Ñeembucú.

===Airports===
The main airport is the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport, located in the town of Luque, which links the department with the rest of the country and abroad.

===Waterway===
The waterways in the Central Department are determined by the “Río Paraguay”, with its main affluents being those of Asunción and Villeta.

==Economy==

Of the 3,049 industrial plants in the Paraguayan territory, 1,558 are found in the Central department. The department&#x27;s industrial production includes food processing, furniture, clothing, pharmaceuticals, metallurgy, plastic, and ceramics. The city of Villeta is home to a large number of industries. Central is the second biggest economy of Paraguay, and occupies the second place in attraction of inversions from other countries. Only 62% of the population is considered economically active.

<text>Concepción () is a department of Paraguay. The capital is the city of Concepción.

== History ==

Throughout history, this department has suffered a great amount of population instability, especially in colonial times, due to the advance of the Brazilian &quot;bandeirantes&quot; through the east and the attacks of the Mbayá – Guaicurú natives of Chaco, which, by then, were the rulers of that region.

During the later years of the colony, it was organized a great campaign to re-conquest the invaded territories with the intention of defending by populating the region and also with the important task of the Jesuit that founded the city of Belén, of creating a Mission with the Mbayá natives, in the year 1760.

During the governments of Francia and López, the populating process got stronger and the north area of Paraguay became a territory dedicated to cattle. Francia ordered the construction of the penal colony of Tevego in 1813 in the Concepción department.
Once the Paraguayan War was over, Concepción united with Amambay, constituting a great territory for forestall and yerba plantations.

In the Twentieth Century, Concepción was proclaimed to be the second most important city of the country and it became an active commercial center. Because of its bind with Mato Grosso it experienced important development during that time.

In the year 1906, with the first plan to arrange the national territory, it was proclaimed the first department. Its limits were established with the decree 426 of 1973, as we know them nowadays.

Deforestation is a big problem in this department because of the continuous advance of human activity, creating a great shock to the natural resources of the region. One of the biggest problems is the uncontrolled hunting of animals in the area.

Most of the forestall species are in extinction danger, as do the animals too. The ones that are in more risk of disappearing of the area are: the puma, yaguareté, gua&#x27;a pytá (red parrot), gua&#x27;a hovy (blue parrot), tucán, tacua guazú, mbo&#x27;i jagua, jacaré overo and lobopé.

Some of the protected areas are:

* The San Luis Mountain Range, 70,000 hectares
* Itapucumí, 45,000 hectares
* Estrella de Concepción, 2,400 hectares
* Laguna Negra, 10 hectares, this area is in danger nowadays

== Economy ==

The silviculture has diminished due to the massive deforestation in this region.

The breeding of animals is the third production of the country, surpassed only by Presidente Hayes and San Pedro&#x27;s. The mortality rates for bovine cattle are relatively low. In Concepción is found the largest land of natural pasturing of the Oriental Region. There are also, porcine, ovine, and goat cattle in important percentage.

In Vallemí is the Cement National Industry, which has 150 lime extractor plants by the Paraguay River. And near the Apa River quarries of marble are exploit.

There are also other industries such as cold-storage plants, silos, mills and cotton gin industries.

<text>New Zealand Cricket, formerly the New Zealand Cricket Council, is the governing body for professional cricket in New Zealand. Cricket is the most popular and highest profile summer sport in New Zealand.

New Zealand Cricket operates the New Zealand cricket team, organising Test tours and One-Day Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket in New Zealand, including the Plunket Shield first-class competition, The Ford Trophy men&#x27;s domestic one-day competition, the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield women&#x27;s domestic one-day competition, as well as the Men&#x27;s Super Smash and Women&#x27;s Super Smash domestic Twenty20 competitions.

Scott Weenink is the Chief Executive Officer of New Zealand Cricket. Tom Latham is the current Blackcaps Test captain, succeeding Tim Southee who still represents the team. Sophie Devine is the current White Ferns captain.

==History==
On 27 December 1894, 12 delegates from around New Zealand met in Christchurch to form the New Zealand Cricket Council. Heathcote Williams was elected the inaugural president, and Charles Smith the secretary. The council&#x27;s aims were to promote and co-ordinate cricket in New Zealand and to organize international tours from and to New Zealand.

==Cricket development==
New Zealand Cricket has established a high performance cricket training centre based at Lincoln University. It also operates a grassroots development programme for school children called &#x27;MILO Kiwi Cricket&#x27;. John Wright, former NZ opening batsman, was appointed acting high performance manager for NZC in November 2007 before taking up the head coach position in December 2010.

Former Australian coach John Buchanan was appointed as NZC Director of Cricket in May 2011 as the architect of a new high performance programme. He performed a number of key duties including the establishment of clear and consistent national coaching philosophies, the implementation of a talent identification programme and oversaw the Selection Panel.

New Zealand has many private cricket academies. The Bracewell Cricket Academy based at Rathkeale College is one of the largest cricket academies, providing an Overseas Cricket Development Programme, a Pre-Season Coaching Camp and a Festival of Cricket.

There are over 100,000 registered cricketers in New Zealand. By way of comparison, Australia and the UK have around 500,000 each.
According to Mark O&#x27;Neill, New Zealand&#x27;s batting coach from 2007 to 2009, the competition at club level in NZ is nowhere near as intense as in Australia.

&quot;In Sydney there are 20 first grade teams, each club has five grades. To get to first grade you&#x27;ve got to be a friggin&#x27; good player and once you get there the competition is very, very fierce. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not the same standard [in NZ]. Competition is everything and the only way the New Zealand guys are going to get that is to play the world&#x27;s best players.&quot;
==Domestic competitions==

New Zealand Cricket operates the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Under 19 New Zealand cricket team, organising Test tours and One-Day Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic and Māori domestic cricket in New Zealand, including the Plunket Shield first-class competition, The Ford Trophy men&#x27;s domestic one-day competition, the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield women&#x27;s domestic one-day competition, as well as the Men&#x27;s Super Smash and Women&#x27;s Super Smash domestic Twenty20 competitions.

===Men&#x27;s Teams===
New Zealand Cricket provides competition structures for the following Major Association domestic teams:
* Auckland Aces
* Canterbury (known as Canterbury Kings for Twenty20)
* Central Stags
* Northern Districts (known as Northern Brave for Twenty20)
* Otago Volts
* Wellington Firebirds

===Women&#x27;s Teams===
New Zealand Cricket involves the following women&#x27;s domestic teams:
* Auckland Hearts
* Canterbury Magicians
* Central Hinds
* Northern Districts (known as Northern Brave for Twenty20)
* Otago Sparks
* Wellington Blaze

==Funding==

New Zealand Cricket derives most of its revenue from the sale of two types of broadcasting rights.

# Broadcasting rights to home internationals.
# A share of the broadcasting rights the ICC sells to its tournaments, such as the World Cup.

Host nations pick up all the expenses of touring teams, but get sole access to all broadcast rights and gate receipts.

In November 2007 it was announced that NZC had made a 5-year deal for the broadcasting rights to home internationals for NZ$65.4m with Sony Entertainment Television. The previous four-year deal between NZC and ESPN-Star was for only NZ$14.4m. Part of the 5-fold increase in value is due to the Indian team&#x27;s tour of NZ in 2009.

Immediately prior to the 2009 Indian tour of NZ the &quot;Sunday Star Times&quot; reported that &quot;NZ Cricket hits $25m jackpot&quot;.

The article claimed that NZ Cricket will get $1 million for each of the 22 days the Indians take the field and that NZ Cricket had insured against loss of income for the sale of TV rights due to bad weather. NZC boss Justin Vaughan also said that a tour by India generates &quot;many times&quot; more income than tours by Australia, South Africa and England and that the Indian tour was worth more to NZC than the payout from the Cricket World Cup, which was around $20m.

The article also states that over the past two years, NZC&#x27;s income has been around $30m, but this year (2009) Vaughan is hoping to get more than $40 million from broadcast rights, sponsorship and ticket sales.

In 2007, the ICC sold the rights to broadcast the World Cup, the Champions Trophy and the ICC World Twenty20 to ESPN Star Sports until 2015 for US$1 billion. NZC will receive a slice of that.

In November 2017, Star Sports acquired the broadcast and digital rights for New Zealand Cricket for all men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s international matches being organised in the country till April 2020 for the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.

== Partnership with USA Cricket (2010) ==
On 19 December 2010, after months of negotiations, New Zealand Cricket announced it had signed a business deal with USACA which would see New Zealand play a certain number of games in the US and also make its players available to participate in any Twenty20 leagues in the USA. A new company was created called Cricket Holdings America LLC. This new company will hold the rights to hold Twenty20 leagues within the United States. New Zealand Cricket chief Justin Vaughan said he was happy with the development because New Zealand was a small market and to exploit a market will allow New Zealand Cricket to secure its funding in the long-term and will also allow cricket to develop popularity as a game in the United States of America.

<text>Cordillera () is a department in Paraguay. The capital is the city of Caacupé.

== History ==

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries this area of the country was going through a serious crisis due to population bellicosity of the Indians from Chaco. The villagers from Tobatí located north of the river Pirapo then called, had to migrate south for the continue attacks by Mbaye-guaicurúes. The residents of Altos and Atyrá created their current settlements in the territory of this department.

There were also some settler farmers who were scattered in existing territories Arroyos y Esteros, 1 de Marzo, Caraguatay and Piribebuy.

Towards the end of the eighteenth century these small towns were expanding, consolidating the villages located north of the department as Arroyos y Esteros Eusebio Ayala (then called town of San Roque).

Once the Paraguayan War, began a process of founding of major towns and settlements driven by German immigrants during the government of Bernardino Caballero. Thus, in 1881 saw the founding of San Bernardino, a major tourist resort of Paraguay today

Already in the early twentieth century, in 1906, was organized legally the country dividing the territory into departments. Thus was created the department of Caraguatay, initial name of the department of Cordillera.

In the year 1945, by a decree Law No. 9484, the department received its present name: Cordillera. Finally in 1973, by Law No. 426 took place in a new territorial reorganization and country, at which consolidates the structure of the department with its current boundaries and districts.

<text>Guairá () is one of the seventeen departments of Paraguay. Its capital and most populous city is Villarrica. It is located to the southern half of the country and to the center of the Eastern Region. Guaira is the second smallest department of Paraguay after Central and the fourth most densely populated after Central, Alto Parana and Cordillera. It was created in 1906.

== Name origin ==
The name Guairá comes from the guarani words: guay + ra. The suffix &quot;ra&quot; means &quot;place&quot; but there is a dispute on the actual meaning of the term &quot;guay&quot;.

The first theory claims it is a contraction of the expression &quot;guara´ira&quot; that means `&quot;a person who will become a warrior&quot;` The second says &quot;guay&quot; is just similar to the ones of Uruguay, Paraguay or Gualeguay which all mean ´&quot;someone&quot; &quot;from the river&quot;´ Spanish conquistador Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca reported that Guayra was the name of an indigenous chief.

== History ==
Before the arrival of the first Spanish explorers, what is now Guairá was populated by an indigenous tribe named Paranaygua. The Paranaygua were a warlike tribe of keen fishermen within the larger Tupi-Guarani family. The first Europeans to explore the territory of Guaira were the Spanish but they had been unsuccessful in their colonization attempts due to the hostility of the Paranaygua. 

One of the first Christians to enter the current territory of Guairá under Paranaygua rule was Mestizo franciscan friar Juan Bernardo Colman. Colman was thought to be a spy for the Spaniards and was executed that same year by the natives. In 1607, another franciscan priest named Luis de Bolaños had better results and managed to settle the town of Caazapá as an Indian mission. With this achievement, the area of what is now Guairá became part of the large region of Caazapá that used to comprise most of the south of Paraguay. From 1617 to 1678 there was not much progress in the settlement of new towns in the area until friar Buenaventura de Villasboa, apprentice of Bolaños, makes an expedition towards the east looking for more Indians to Christianize. Villasboa gathered a group of uncontacted guaranis and settled with them the mission of Ytapé in 1682. Later that same year, the pilgrims of the city of Villa Rica also settled nearby. These people called themselves &quot;guaireños&quot; because their city was originally founded in the extinct Spanish province of Guayra. In 1773, Paraguay Spanish Governor Agustin de Pinedo founded a town named Hyaty to the northwest of Villarrica and in 1778, another Spanish Governor Pedro Melo de Portugal founded the town of Yhacanguazu this time to the southwest of Villarrica. By 1785, relatives of governor Juan Ortiz de Zarate owned land in what is now the town of Tebicuary and another Spaniard named Francisco del Monge started the settlement of current Coronel Martinez by donating part of his property to his former employees.

After the independence of Paraguay (1811), pioneers from Villarrica began to explore the surrounding areas looking for wood and more land to grow yerba mate. By this efforts new populated places emerged such as Mbocayaty, Yataity and Potrero Cosme.

After the end of the Paraguayan War in 1870, the region was briefly occupied by the Brazilian Army and in 1889 the first railway passengers arrived to the area in stations built in Villarrica, Borja and a number of unexplored sites that later became towns such as Fassardi and Garay. The railway increased the commerce and helped with the development of small industries. In 1906, the new department of Guaira was created including the municipalities of Villarrica, Mbocayaty, Yataity and Hyaty.

== Location ==
The department is in the center and slightly to the south of the Eastern Region of Paraguay. It borders Caaguazu department to the north, Caazapa department to the south and to the east and Paraguari department to the west.

== Municipalities ==
The department is divided in the following 18 municipalities.
# Borja
# Mauricio José Troche
# Independencia
# Coronel Martínez
# Dr. Botrell
# Félix Pérez Cardozo
# General Eugenio A. Garay
# Itapé
# Iturbe
# José Fassardi
# Mbocayaty
# Natalicio Talavera
# Ñumí
# Paso Yobai
# San Salvador
# Villarrica
# Yataity
# Tebicuary

== Geography ==

In the department there are three natural zones that are very well differentiated. The first zone, near the Villarica or Ybyturuzu, hills, there are high lands and forests that are woody with steep slopes. The second zone, the central west, has fertile lands. In the southwest part one can find the third zone, the most fertile and populated area. Its large plains are good for raising cattle. Besides the Ybyturuzu hills, we can also find the hills of Pelado, Polilla, Itape, Leon, Cerrito and Tres Kandú, with 848 m, the highest peak in the country.

Guaira is mainly irrigated by the Tebicuarymi River, a tributary of the Paraguay River and by a network of tributary streams such as Yhaca Guazu, Aguapety, Guazu, Yhu, Mitay, Cristalino and Tacuaras.

== Weather ==
The department has mild and good weather, with an average temperature of 21 degrees Celsius. In the summer, the maximum temperature is 38 degrees, and in the winter, the temperature goes down to 1 degree. It rains a lot during October and November. During the year, there is a total of 1,537 millimetres of rain.

== Demographics ==
Out of a total of 209,000 people in 2012, 41.4% lived in the urban area and 58.6% in the rural area. The only city with more than 50,000 people is Villarrica. Independencia and Paso Yobai are the second and third most populated places with over 20,000 people each.

== Flag and Arms ==

The flag is divided in two horizontal zones of similar dimensions. The upper zone, light blue, is related to the water and the sky; the lower zone, purple, represents the grapes and wine produced in the region but also the color purple represents the Catholic Church.

The shield is divided into four parts, where there is a typical colonial style house, and the zone&#x27;s landscape, which includes the Ybyturuzu hills, grapes and sugar cane which are the main crops. There is also a book, with the Roman numerals corresponding to the number of the department of Guaira. In the center of the shield there is a butterfly that represents a poem of Manuel Ortiz Guerrero. At the bottom of the shield says &quot;Culture of Traditions&quot;.

== Economy ==

Guairá is a predominantly agricultural department. It is the country&#x27;s largest sugar cane producer, with 41% of the national output. It is also the main producer of grapes and wine and the second producer of yerba mate. Other relevant crops are soybeans, maize and onions. Guaira also produces 8.5 kg of gold per month which is exported mainly to the US and Canada.

Deforestation has affected the wood industry, nevertheless, there are still several sawmills and workshops for furniture making. The main industries are a sugar factory in Tebicuary, an alcohol distillery in Troche, footwear and scale manufacturers in Villarrica and yerba mate producers in Paso Yobai and Independencia.

== Infrastructure ==

The Department contains the Number 8 Blas Garay Road, which starts in Coronel Oviedo from the Number 2 and 7 Roads, and is paved until Caazapa. From the Ñumi district there is another paved part that connects to San Juan Nepomuceno. It also has other paved roads: Villarica–Paraguari, through Felix Perez Cardozo and Coronel Martinez, Mbocayati-Independencia, with an extension of 50 km, and another way that connects the Number 7 Road through Natalicio Talavera, Troche and Colonia Blas Garay. Guaira also has aerial communication, telephones and telegraphs. There are many roads that cross the territory in all directions.

== Education ==
From the founding of the city of Villarrica del Espíritu Santo, work on education began and hasn&#x27;t stopped since. Starting in 1585, the Franciscans opened a convent that they named Santa Barbara, and elementary and secondary schools were attached. In the 17th century, the Paraguay province had free courses in grammar, Philosophy and Sanctity in Asunción and Villarica, under the direction of the Franciscan, Dominican, Merced, and Jesuit priests

The first teaching center, sustained by the state of Villarica, dates back to 1859, and was named Escuela La Patria. Nowadays, the superior education in the department is represented by Universidad Católica &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Asunción,&quot; and Universidad Nacional de Asunción in the north. In Guairá, there are many schools and institutes, private as well as public, such as Colegio Nacional, Colegio Ortiz Guerrero, Colegio Tecnico Vocacional, Seminario Diocesano, Escuela Regional de Agricultura, Instituto Professional Femenino, Escuela de Artes and Oficios Pio XII.

There are also various pre-school centers and Humanistic high schools, as well as Technical ones. Another educational entity is the Institute of Guaraní Linguistics, Idelguap, which teaches the Guarani language, literature, and folklore. There is also, with similar goals, the Ateneo of Guaraní Language and Culture and Guaraní Roga.

== Art and culture ==

The main city, Villarrica, is considered the largest city in the department. Among the social, cultural and sports entities, there are &quot;The Porvenir Guaireño,&quot; &quot; El Centro Español,&quot; &quot;El Club de Leones,&quot; &quot; Instituto de Cultura Hispánica,&quot; &quot;Teatro Municipal,&quot; &quot;Orquesta de Cámara,&quot; &quot;Escuela Municipal de Danzas, Declamación, Oratoria, Guitar,&quot; &quot;Asociación de Productores de Caña de Azúcar,&quot; &quot;Liga Guaireña de Fútbol&quot; y &quot; Liga Guaireña de Basquetbol.&quot;

In 1970, the Socioeconomical Development Center of Guaira was created, formed by public and private entities, which supports the department&#x27;s economic, social and cultural development. The Ybyturuzu Foundation, an environmental organization, attempts to spread consciousness throughout Guairá&#x27;s population to keep, protect and defend the important ecosystem of the area.

In the city there are a few radio stations, closed circuit television, cable TV and channel 8. In terms of their intangible culture, the guireños keep a repertoire of different popular myths and legends, such as pora, pombero, jasy jatere, kurupi, urutau, karau, and jakare, among others. Among the European traditions, they have the patronal parties, day of the cross, corridas de toros, horse races, and riñas de gallos.

== Tourism ==

Guairá has one of the most emblematic and representative cities of the Paraguayan culture: Villarica.

In Villarica, nature is a friend and trusts the human beings who live there, or the ones who are attracted by its fame for being a paradise and who decide to wander about its geography, to know its history and to drink from its culture. One of the most widely visited places in the city is the Manuel Ortiz Guerrero Park, which before 1936 was known as Ycua Pyta. Here you can feel the soul of Villarica like no other place in the city. The calm nature of the place helps one to forget the activities of daily life. It is an ideal place for the soul and the body. The Manuel Oritz Guerrero Park is located in the northeast area of the city, between the Ybaroty and San Miguel neighborhoods.

At the beginning of the 1960s a sculpture was made by Javier Baez Rolon to commemorate a Villariquean poet. On May 8, 1983, for the 50th anniversary of the poet&#x27;s death, his ashes were moved to the park, fulfilling the citizens&#x27; dream. From that day on, under the shadow of a tree, the poet rests in peace in the land of his soul. His poetry still vibrates under the look of his beloved Ybytyruzu.

Other cultural centers that one must visit are the Maestro Fermin Lopez Museum and the Library, where one can find the personal belongings of Natalicio Talavera, Fermin Lopez, and Manuel Ortiz, as well as weapons from the Chaco War, a collection of coins and Paraguayan bills, and arrows and axes made by the native peoples. In the museum one can see, among others, very old objects, old furniture, old machines, paintings, photographs, and different sacred art donated by the Church of Villarica. In the district of Itape there is a sacred place named the &quot;Paso de la Virgen,&quot; whose festival is celebrated on December 18. Its sanctuary on the side of the Tebicuary-mi River is visited by thousands of pilgrims during the year.

Another tourist attraction is the Cristal Waterfalls, which are 43 meters high. Below the waterfalls there are many different colored fish, and a beautiful forest surrounding them. On the Tororo hill one can see runic inscriptions, said to be from the Vikings from the Pre-Columbian times. Lovers of the ao poi embroideries can enjoy beautiful samples in the Mbocayaty and Yataity districts.

== Notable people ==
*Manuel Ortiz Guerrero (1899–1933) The biggest and most widely known of the guaireños poets. He was born, lived, and died as a poet. He made the poetry the reason for his life. His poetry has entered to the depths of the national soul. The guaireñan land gave him its aroma and charm, and he gave back his poetry, transformed into light. His life was an example of dignity, struggle and correction.
*Natalicio de María Talavera (1839–1867) Initial figure of the Paraguayan parnassus. He was a representative of the true intellectuals in moments when the poetry in Paraguay was just beginning. His work is presented under the form of scattered fragments. The Paraguayan War ate up a great part of it. Talavera was not a poet with an easy and simple life. He lived the tragedy of the nation, and sang to it with a great feeling and depth.
*Efraím Cardozo (1909–1973) He was known as the richest and most systematic Paraguayan historian. He was a journalist, writer, professor and politician. He represented Paraguay in key moments of its history, such as the signing of the treaty of Peace and Borders with Bolivia. He published many books on Paraguayan history.

His special quality of playing an instrument, together with his strong personality, gave him the chance to visit cultural centers in different countries: Argentina, Uruguay, Chile. He was considered the richest composer in Paraguay. He created 87 musical compositions, among them polcas, guaranias, songs, galopas, milongas, zambas, cuecas, boleros, tangos and chacareras.

<doc id="715760" wikidata="Q5503624" url="?curid=715760" title="Fried dough">
<text>Fried dough is a North American food associated with outdoor food stands in carnivals, amusement parks, fairs, rodeos, and seaside resorts. &quot;Fried dough&quot; is the specific name for a particular variety of fried bread made of a yeast dough; see the accompanying images for an example of use on carnival-booth signs. Fried dough is also known as fry dough, [[Frybread|fry bread]] (bannock), fried bread, doughboys, elephant ears, beaver tails, scones, pizza fritte, frying saucers (in the case of smaller pieces). These foods are virtually identical to each other and some yeast dough versions of beignets, and recognizably different from other fried dough foods such as doughnuts or fritters.

==Regional variants==
In Canadian cuisine, pieces of fried dough are sometimes called . According to Bill Castleman, a writer of books on Canadian word origins, the name referred to quick-baked dough &quot;especially in early 19th-century places where people might camp for one night and where there was no frying pan.&quot; In 1978, Pam and Grant Hooker of Ottawa, Ontario, founded the BeaverTails chain of restaurants specializing in the sale of fried dough pastries which are hand stretched to the shape of a beaver&#x27;s tail. 

In Newfoundland, a province in Eastern Canada, fried dough is referred to as a &quot;touton&quot;. A touton /ˈtaʊtən is produced by frying bread dough on a pan with butter or the leftover fat from &quot;scrunchions&quot; (fried preserved pork) and served with dark molasses, maple syrup, or corn syrup. It is traditionally made from leftover bread dough and pan-fried, as opposed to deep-fried.

A smaller Italian variant common in North America is the &quot;zeppole.&quot;

Similar food is found in Europe, also typically from outdoor stands in fairs. For example, in Croatia, fried dough is known as &quot;languši&quot;, in Hungary as lángos, in Austria as kiachl, in Germany as Knieküchle while the oliebol is eaten in the Netherlands. In north Spain is typical of Carnival season and has a spiritual connection with it, just like &#x27;roscón&#x27; in Christmas or &#x27;arroz con leche&#x27; in Easter. In Bulgaria, a similar dish is called mekitsa.

A type of soft, fried dough ball frequently coated in sugar can be found in some Chinese restaurants in New York. These dough balls are referred to by any one of a number of names, including but not necessarily limited to &quot;sugar biscuits&quot;, &quot;Chinese doughnuts&quot;, or the simpler &quot;fried bread&quot;.

Turkic countries in Central Asia also have a similar food called Boortsog or Pişi.

In New Zealand and other areas such as Hawaii, the Māori people cook Parāoa Parai, a fry bread that is a traditional part of a Matariki feast.

==Preparation==
Fried dough is made by deep-frying a portion of risen yeast dough. The dough acquires an irregular, bubbly appearance from being fried.

The dough may then be sprinkled with a variety of toppings, such as granulated sugar, powdered sugar, cinnamon, fruit sauce, chocolate sauce, cheese, maple syrup, whipped cream, tomato sauce (with optional grated Parmesan cheese), garlic butter, lemon juice, honey, butter, nuts, or a combination of these or even served with ice cream.

<text>Itapúa () is a department in the southern region of Paraguay. The capital is the city of Encarnación. It is divided into 30 districts, more than any other department in the country.

==History==
This department was created after the breakup of the Misiones Department, with the city of Encarnación as the capital. It had high economic growth in the first 30 years of the arrival of immigrants and the Carlos Antonio Lopez Railway; the growth was accompanied by several ups and downs.

An era of decline followed until the 1950s when the Carnaval Encarnaceno became better known and attracted tourists from various regions. In the 1980s the department became more industrial, but modestly so compared with other departments like the Central Department.

In 1989 the Yacyretá Dam displaced the people living in the Yacyretá Reservoir; the displacement still continues. The San Roque González de Santa Cruz Bridge was inaugurated in 1991, connecting not only the city of Encarnación and Posadas, but also Paraguay with Argentina.

== Toponymy ==
The name is in Guaraní and refers to the place where Encarnación, the current capital city, was founded. The site was known as &quot;&quot;itá&quot; (rock, stone) and &quot;punta&quot;&quot; (tip); hence the name means &quot;Tip of the Stone&quot;.

==Demography==

According to the 2002 National Census Itapúa has a total population of 453,692 inhabitants making it the third-most populated department of the country after Central and Alto Paraná. 8.9% of Paraguay&#x27;s total population lives in this department.

===Cultural diversity===

Much of the Itapúa region was colonized by immigrants from different origins, among them the Italians, Germans, Ukrainians, French, Japanese, Poles, and also immigrants from Syria and Lebanon in more recent times. Because of this cultural diversity Itapúa was given the name &quot;Melting pot&quot;, making it the most cosmopolitan department of Paraguay.

In the beginning, the first major economic activity of the immigrants was the exploitation of natural resources, especially timber, in the Alto Paraná and San Rafael Hills (now a national park). Nowadays, residents are engaged in several thriving industries, including agriculture (soybean, tung, corn, etc.) and livestock.

==Geography==

===Location===
This department is located southeast of the Eastern Region of Paraguay.

===Limits===
* North: the departments of Alto Paraná and Caazapá.
* South: with Argentina (Provinces of Misiones and Corrientes). Separated by the Paraná River.
* East: the Argentine Republic (Misiones Province).
* West: with the Misiones Department.

===Climate===
The climate is humid subtropical with a tendency to low temperatures, the annual average is 15 °C, with a maximum of 40 °C and a minimum of -3 °C. Rainfall is abundant, with an annual average of nearly 1,700 mm, recorded throughout most of the year except in July and August.

== Administrative division ==
The department is divided into the following 30 districts:

<text>Misiones () is a department located in the southern region of Paraguay. Its capital is San Juan Bautista. The eighth of Paraguay&#x27;s 17 departments, it was created in 1906, then known as the &quot;San Ignacio Department&quot;, and was not given its present name until 1945. Its current name reflects its status as home to several Jesuit Reductions, or missions.

Misiones borders the departments of Paraguarí and Caazapá to the north, Itapúa to the east, Ñeembucú to the west, and the Corrientes Province of Argentina to the south.

== History ==

The modern settling of Misiones began with the arrival of Jesuit missionaries to the region in the 17th century and the subsequent establishment of several reductions whose purpose was to both civilize and catechize the indigenous Guaraní peoples. While several of these reductions would ultimately be in Argentinian and Brazilian territory, 8 of the reductions would remain in Paraguay, concentrated in what would become the Misiones and Itapúa departments. Some of these reductions, namely San Ignacio Guazú, Santa Maria de Fe and Santiago would become the foundation for subsequent towns in Misiones.

The town of Yabebyry was established in 1790, and later, during the presidency of Carlos Antonio López, the towns of San Miguel and San Juan Bautista were founded. When the Misiones department was created in 1906 as the San Ignacio department, these towns were made several of the department&#x27;s first 8 districts, along with Santa Rosa, Ayolas and Villa Florida. When the department was renamed in 1945, its capital was moved from San Ignacio to San Juan Bautista.

== Geography ==

Misiones department is relatively flat and crossed by a number of rivers and streams. The northern and southern borders of the department are formed by, respectively, the Tebicuary and the Paraná rivers, the latter of which is an important waterway in the region. A number of other streams cross the department, including the Yabebyry, Atingui, San Roque, Sauce, Uruguay, Ca&#x27;a Po&#x27;i, Tororo, San Tadeo, San Antonio and Itay.

== Districts ==

The department is divided into ten districts:

== Economy ==
The main economic activities are livestock raising and agriculture. Cattle are the most common livestock, and pigs, sheep, horses, and goats are common as well. Agriculture is widely practiced, with fields mainly in the north and center of the department. The main crops are rice, soya, corn, sweet oranges, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, potatoes, and cotton.

== Transportation ==
===Roads===
Misiones is connected to Asunción and Encarnación via national route PY01 which passes through 6 of the 10 districts: Villa Florida, San Miguel, San Juan Bautista, San Ignacio, Santa Rosa and San Patricio, it even passes through the district of Santiago, but not by its urban area.&lt;br&gt;
The national routes PY04 and PY20 connects Misiones with neighbor Ñeembucú department.&lt;br&gt;
All ten districts urban areas are accessible by paved road.

===Airports===
Small airports are located in San Juan Bautista and Ayolas (Juan de Ayolas Airport) to the south.
===Water transport===
The southern part of the department is accessible to the Paraná River, which is navigable by large cargo ships downstream of the Yacyretá Dam near Ayolas.

== Education ==
There are numerous institutions which provide Pre-school Education, Elementary and Highschool . with Technical and Scientific emphasis.

== Tourism ==

Its main attractions are the beaches formed by the rivers Paraná and Tebicuary. Villa Florida is a city which offers landscapes to its visitors.
This department is known by the work of evangelizing by the Jesuits priests who founded the place with many reductions. A few towns still have the remains of that era such as the colonial churches.

Part of the historical remains is exposed in Museums with many samples of wooden carvings made by the Indians at the reductions period.

<text>The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) is an organized research unit of the University of California, San Diego. Founded in 1985, it was one of the five original NSF supercomputing centers.

Its research pursuits are high performance computing, grid computing, computational biology, geoinformatics, computational physics, computational chemistry, data management, scientific visualization, cyberinfrastructure, and computer networking. SDSC computational biosciences contributions and earth science and genomics computational approaches are internationally recognized.

The current SDSC director is Frank Würthwein, Ph.D., UC San Diego physics professor and a founding faculty member of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute of UC San Diego. Würthwein assumed the role in July 2021. He succeeded Michael L. Norman, also a physics professor at UC San Diego, and who was the SDSC director since September 2010.
==Divisions and projects==
SDSC roles include creating and maintaining the Protein Data Bank, the George E. Brown Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Cyberinfrastructure Center (NEESit), cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences (GEON), and the Tree of Life Project (TOL) are especially well known.

SDSC is one of the four original TeraGrid project sites with National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Argonne National Laboratory, and the Center for Advanced Computing Research (CACR).

SDSC is a data management software development pioneer, having developed the Rocks cluster computing environment and storage resource broker (SRB).

SDSC is home to the Performance Modeling and Characterization (PMaC) laboratory, whose mission is to bring scientific rigor to the prediction and understanding of factors affecting the performance of current and projected High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. PMaC is funded by the Department of Energy (SciDac PERC research grant), the Department of Defense (Navy DSRC PET program), DARPA, and the National Science Foundation. Allan E. Snavely founded the PMaC laboratory in 2001.

In 2009 a combined team from SDSC and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs led by Allan Snavely won the prestigious Data Challenge competition held in Portland Oregon, at SC09, the annual premier conference in High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis for their design of a new kind of supercomputer that makes extensive use of flash memory and nicknamed &quot;Dash&quot;. Dash was a prototype for a much larger system nicknamed &quot;Gordon&quot; that the team deployed at SDSC in 2011 with more than 256 TB of flash memory. &quot;Gordon&quot; became operational in 2011, with a formal launch on December 5, 2011. 
SDSC is also home to the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), and the Computational and Applied Statistics Laboratory (CASL). CAIDA is a collaboration of government, research, and commercial entities working together to improve the Internet. It features an academic network test infrastructure called the &quot;Archipelago Measurement Infrastructure&quot; (Ark), similar to networks such as PlanetLab and RIPE Atlas.

<text>The Amstel () is a river in the province of North Holland in the Netherlands. It flows from the Aarkanaal and Drecht in Nieuwveen northwards, passing Uithoorn, Amstelveen, and Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, to the IJ in Amsterdam, to which the river gives its name. Annually, the river is the location of the Liberation Day concert, Head of the River Amstel rowing match, and the Amsterdam Gay Pride boat parade.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Amstel&quot; and the older form &quot;Aemstel&quot; are derived from &quot;Amestelle&quot;, which is a compound of the words &quot;aam&quot; or &quot;ame&quot; meaning water and &quot;stelle&quot; meaning solid, high, and dry ground. In the 12th century, &quot;Amestelle&quot; was used for the area or &quot;gouw&quot; that was closed in by the rivers Amstel and Bullewijk and the bay IJ. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, the area was developed and ruled by the Van Amstel family. The river Amstel was named after this land area.

Between 1525 and 1990, the water board or &quot;hoogheemraadschap&quot; of the area through which the river flows was Amstelland (Amstel Land), a name still in use for the region. The names of the settlements Amstelhoek (Amstel Bend), Amsterdam (Amstel Dam), Nes aan de Amstel (Headland upon Amstel), and Ouderkerk aan de Amstel (Old Church upon Amstel) on the banks of the Amstel were derived from the river&#x27;s name.

==History==
The Amstel was formed around 1050 BC when a freshwater river cut into a tidal channel of the IJ which are now Damrak and Rokin.

==Course==
=== Sources ===
The Amstel begins where the canal Aarkanaal and the river Drecht meet, just north of the village Nieuwveen in the province of South Holland. Here the river forms the border between the provinces of South Holland and North Holland and flows in northeastern direction.

=== Amstelland ===
The Amstel passes the hamlet Vrouwenakker and is then joined by the tributary river Kromme Mijdrecht. On the northern bank is the town Uithoorn and on the southern bank is the village Amstelhoek. Here the river forms the border between the provinces of Utrecht and North Holland.

Further on, the river is joined by the tributary river Oude Waver. From here onwards, the river flows northward through the province of North Holland. The Amstel passes the village Nes aan de Amstel.

On the western bank is the town Amstelveen, where there is a small island in the river named Amsteleiland, and on the eastern bank the town of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, where the river is joined by the tributary river Bullewijk. After this the Amstel flows into the city of Amsterdam.

=== Amsterdam ===
In Amsterdam, the canals Duivendrechtsevaart and Weespertrekvaart are tributaries to the Amstel. There are several historical bridges crossing the river, among which are the Berlagebrug, Magere Brug, and Blauwbrug.

In the city center, the river is connected to several city canals, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Amstel Hotel, Royal Theater Carré, H&#x27;ART Museum, city hall in the Stopera, and Allard Pierson Museum are located on the eastern bank of the river.

The river continues via the Rokin to the Langebrugsteeg before being routed underground through pipes, passing under the filled in part of the Rokin and Dam Square before remerging into the Damrak at the Oudebrugsteeg. The river then passes beneath the Prins Hendrikkade before empyting into the .

=== Mouth ===
The original course continues with Damrak, after which it passes Stationseiland, an artificial island with Amsterdam Centraal station, and flows into the former bay IJ.

== Cultural events ==
A nationally televised concert is held on the river every year on Liberation Day. The rowing races Head of the River Amstel and Heineken Roeivierkamp are held on the river annually. The river also forms part of the route of the Canal Parade, Amsterdam&#x27;s annual floating gay pride parade.

==Artist impressions==
The river has been depicted by many artists, including:
*Aert van der Neer (1603–1677)
*Rembrandt (1609–1669)
*Willem Witsen (1860–1923)
*George Hendrik Breitner (1857–1923)
*Piet Mondrian (1872–1944)

<text>John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley ( –1553), commonly known as Lord Quondam, was an English nobleman.

==Early life==
John Sutton was born in 1494, at Dudley Castle, Worcestershire, the eldest son and heir of Sir Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley and his wife Cicely ( Willoughby) Sutton. Cecily was a daughter of Sir William Willoughby and Joan Strangeways, and granddaughter of Katherine Neville, Duchess of Norfolk.

John Sutton had several younger brothers: Thomas, William, Arthur, Geoffery and George. Among his sisters were Hon. Eleanor Sutton (wife of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, and Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane), Hon. Jane Sutton (wife of Sir Thomas Fiennes and mother of Thomas Fiennes, 9th Baron Dacre), and Hon. Margaret Sutton (wife of John Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Powis).

==Career==
Sutton was a soldier and was with Henry VIII in France in 1513, fighting in War of the Holy League with Spain against France. He was knighted on 13 October that year.

He succeeded his father, Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley, as Baron Dudley in 1532. He was already very much in debt at this time, he and his father having already borrowed money as early as 1512, and immediately began to sell his patrimony, including half of Powis Castle. His father had already sold most of the Sutton interest in the barony of Malpas in 1521, as well as Northfield in 1531. Sutton sold the rest to Sir Rowland Hill in 1537. The barony of Malpas had been held by the Sutton family since about 1270, when Isabel Patrick married Richard de Sutton. He sold the manor of Oxley in Staffordshire to James Levison in 1533.

In 1532, immediately after his succession as Baron Dudley, Sutton also borrowed £2000 against his estates from his cousin, the Earl of Warwick and future Duke of Northumberland John Dudley, with a £400 yearly repayment. Sutton wrote to Thomas Cromwell, then serving as a member of the King&#x27;s Privy Council, that year asking him to use his influence with the King to persuade him to pay the £2000 in exchange for the £180 per year rent for the manor of Sedgley for 20 years. Sutton wrote again to Cromwell in 1533 asking him to pay the £400 yearly repayment. This was apparently unsuccessful and Sutton sold the manor and castle of Dudley to his cousin in 1535. It appears Cromwell lent Sutton £1000 some time before 1538-9
Sutton acquired the derogatory nickname &quot;Lord Quondam&quot; (&#x27;Lord Has-been&#x27; or &#x27;Lord Formerly&#x27;) after allowing his estate, including the castle of Dudley, to fall into the possession of his cousin.

There is much evidence in James Gairdner&#x27;s &quot;Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII&quot; to suggest that Sutton&#x27;s cousin, John Dudley, and Cromwell between them colluded to entangle Lord Dudley before the fact, and did not simply take advantage of him afterwards, as suggested by Dugdale&#x27;s sources. Cromwell had long been friends with Cecily Grey and her family, having served as her father&#x27;s advisor in 1523, and bought out Baron Dudley&#x27;s lands to help save her family from ruin.

Sutton&#x27;s wife, Lady Cecily, Baroness Dudley, wrote to the Lord Privy Seal (Cromwell) on 24 February 1538, describing the effect of her family&#x27;s loss of income:
&quot;The cause of my writing unto you is, desiring you to be good lord unto me; it is so, as you know very well, that by the means of my lord, my husband, I and all mine are utterly undone, unless it be the better provided by the Grace of God, and likewise that it may please the King&#x27;s highness to take pity of me and mine. . . The truth is, I have little above twenty pound a year, (which I have by my lady my mother,) to find me and one of my daughters with a woman and a man to wait upon me; and surely, unless the good prioress of Nuneaton did give me meat and drink of free cost, to me and all mine that here remains with me, I could not tell what shift to make. Over and besides that, whensoever any of my children comes hither to see me, they be welcome unto the prioress as long as they list to tarry, horsemeat and man&#x27;s meat, and cost them nothing, with a piece of gold or two in their purses at their departure.&quot;

Northumberland resided for many years at Dudley Castle and added new and magnificent structures to the old fortress. In 1675, the historian, William Dugdale, wrote of Sutton&#x27;s sale of Dudley Castle to his cousin: &quot;It is reported by credible tradition of this John Lord Dudley, that being a man of weak understanding, whereby he had exposed himself to some wants, and so became entangled in the usurer&#x27;s bonds, John Dudley, then Viscount Lisle and Earl of Warwick (afterwards Duke of Northumberland), thirsting after Dudley Castle, the chief seat of the family, made those money merchants his instruments to work him out of it, which by some mortgage being at length effected, this poor lord became exposed to the charity of his friends for a subsistence, and spending the remainder of his life in visits amongst them, was commonly called the Lord Quondam.&quot; 

Lord Dudley was never summoned to Parliament.

==Personal life==
By 30 October 1501, he was betrothed to Lady Cecily Grey (c.1497-1554), a daughter of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, by Cecily Bonville, his wife, &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness Harington and Baroness Bonville. Lady Cecily was the grand-daughter of the former Queen, Elizabeth Woodville. They subsequently married and Lord Dudley and Lady Cecily were the parents of at least nine children, several of whom were directly involved on both sides in the conflicts and turmoil surrounding the English Reformation:

* Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley (–1586), who married one of Queen Mary I&#x27;s Gentlewomen of the Privy Chamber, Catherine Brydges, the daughter of John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos, in 1556. After her death in 1566, he married Lady Jane Stanley, a daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, in 1567. After her death, he married Mary Howard, the daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard in 1571.
* Hon. Sir Henry Sutton Dudley (1517–1568), a diplomat who was a conspirator of the Tudor period against Queen Mary; he married Anne Ashton, daughter of Sir Christopher Ashton and step-daughter of Lady Catherine Gordon. Sir Christopher also plotted against Queen Mary.
* Hon. George Sutton, a soldier at Calais who plotted against Queen Elizabeth I.
* Hon. Maud Sutton, who married Ralph Josceline.
* Hon. Margaret Sutton, who married William Guibon of Watlington, Norfolk.
* Hon. Thomas Sutton (1539–1574), who married and had issue.
* Hon. Dorothy Sutton.
* Hon. Elizabeth Sutton.
* Hon. Robert Sutton.

After losing Dudley Castle in 1537, Sutton, who retained the title Baron Dudley, moved to his city residence at Tothill Street in Westminster, which his father had been hiring since 1522. He died in Middlesex and was buried on 18 September 1553 in St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, London; Cecily, Baroness Dudley, was also buried there on 28 April 1554. Accounts of his funeral were given by the diarist Henry Machyn:

&quot;Sir John Dudley was buried at Westminster, Sept. 21st 1553, the backside of St. Margaret&#x27;s. His crest a blue lion&#x27;s head standing upon a crown of gold&quot;

And a transcript of a contemporary account published by John Strype in his &quot;Memorials&quot;:
&quot;Sir John Dudley, baron of Dudley, happening to die at Westminster, his obsequies were celebrated on the 21st of September, honourably; but with the odd, popish ceremonies; that is to say, priests and clerks going before and singing in Latin. Then a priest wearing a cope, then a clerk, having the holy water-sprinkle in hand. After, a mourner bearing this lord&#x27;s standard. After him, another bearing his great banner of arms, gold, and silver; another bearing his helmet, mantle and crest, a blue lion&#x27;s head, standing upon a crown of gold. After, another mourner, bearing his target and another his sword. Next came Mr. Somerset, the herald, with his coat armour of gold and silver. And then the corse, covered with cloth of gold to the ground, and four of his men, bearing him, his arms hanging upon the cloth of gold; and twelve men, of his servants, carrying twelve staff-torches burning, to the church. In the quire was a horse made of timber, covered with black and arms up the black. And after, came the mourners, making a great company. After the dirge began, the herald came to the choir door, and prayed for his soul by his style. And so the dirge-song began in Latin and all the lessons. And then the herald prayed for a soul-mass. And so the mass was sung in Latin. And after, this noblemen&#x27;s helmet, coat and target were offered. And, after all ended, the standard and banner of arms were offered, and so the company repaired to the house whence they set out. Then followed the ringing of bells and a great dole.&quot;

His cousin and nemesis John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland was executed on 22 August the same year, 1553, after plotting to install Lady Jane Grey on the English throne. After Northumberland&#x27;s execution, Dudley Castle was forfeited to the crown, and in 1555 was restored by Queen Mary to Lord Dudley&#x27;s eldest son, Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley and his wife, Catherine Brydges.

<doc id="715794" wikidata="Q4591652" url="?curid=715794" title="1996 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1996 Republican National Convention convened at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, California, from August 12 to August 15, 1996. The convention nominated Senator Bob Dole from Kansas, for president and former representative and secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, from suburban Buffalo, New York, for vice president.

==Background==
===Political context===

After a bitter primary, Dole had secured the Republican presidential nomination—but at high cost, financially and politically. The Party had lost momentum after President Bill Clinton successfully co-opted the historically Republican issues of crime and welfare reform and portrayed Speaker Newt Gingrich as an extremist.

Within his own party, Dole was under pressure from both sides of the political spectrum. Social liberals such as California governor Pete Wilson and Massachusetts governor Bill Weld loudly argued to remove the Human Life Amendment plank from the convention platform. On the right, primary opponents Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes withheld endorsements—Buchanan staged a rally for his supporters in nearby Escondido on the eve of the San Diego convention. Indeed, past comments by Kemp labeling Dole as a tax-raiser surfaced. The long, bitter primary had also left the Dole campaign short of funds as a result of federal election spending limits in the months leading up to the convention.

The Dole campaign sought to use the convention to unite the party, to appeal to political moderates, and to highlight Dole&#x27;s honorable service in World War II and in the U.S. Senate. Nearly all floor speeches were delivered by moderate or liberal Republicans, including the keynote address by New York Representative Susan Molinari, and Dole was nominated by fellow veteran and Arizona Senator John McCain. Gingrich, who less than two years earlier had been a star of the party, was denied a prime time slot altogether, as was Buchanan, who had finished in second place for the nomination, with over 200 delegates. However, supporters in the socially conservative grassroots organizations such as the Christian Coalition directed the convention to adopt a conservative platform with little controversy, and Buchanan released his delegates at the last minute.

The convention ran smoothly overall, and the Dole-Kemp team seemed to benefit in the short term. Opinion polls taken shortly after the conclusion of the convention showed the Republicans with a significant &quot;bump&quot; of increased support. However, this bump was extremely temporary, and they continued to trail the incumbent Clinton-Gore team; they went on to lose the election by almost nine points.

===Site selection===
The Republican National Committee asked 30 cities to submit bids. Their finalist cities were Chicago, New Orleans, New York City, San Antonio, and San Diego. Chicago withdrew after winning their bid to host the 1996 Democratic National Convention. San Diego, ultimately, beat out the remaining finalists to win the RNC. The selection of San Diego was announced in January 1995.

The 1996 RNC was the first presidential nominating convention to be held in San Diego, and the only Republican National Convention held in Southern California (the 1972 RNC was scheduled for the San Diego Sports Arena but relocated to Miami Beach, Florida, due to scandal). Indeed, San Diego&#x27;s bid had been considered unlikely to win. The San Diego Convention Center was far smaller than its predecessor venues, the Astrodome in Houston and the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, and its normal seating layout left several sections and skyboxes with obstructed views. Ardent lobbying by Mayor Susan Golding, who some named as a potential candidate for U.S. Senate in 1998, and by Governor Wilson, himself to seek the 1996 presidential nomination, helped secure San Diego&#x27;s selection in 1994.

====Bids====
;Other bids
In mid-February 1994, Los Angeles, California, withdrew its bid to have the Los Angeles Convention Center host the convention, citing the previous month&#x27;s 1994 Northridge earthquake as the reason the city could not afford to finance the hosting of such an event in 1996.

In late-March 1994, St. Louis, Missouri, withdrew its bid.

===Logistics===

The San Diego Host Committee, &quot;Sail to Victory &#x27;96,&quot; was organized on September 8, 1995.

This was the first national party convention since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which sparked heightened concerns over terrorism. The possibility that the explosion of TWA Flight 800 weeks before was a terrorist incident also weighed on convention planners. The Convention Center was located on the waterfront, near a harbor frequented by thousands of small boats—upon one of which Dole and Kemp made their ceremonial arrival. The police, Coast Guard, and other security presence was massive.

Convention planners situated the designated protest area several blocks away from the convention center, sparking criticism and legal action. It was later moved to a parking lot closer to the building which had originally been designated as an ADA-compliant transportation hub.

The convention was successful for San Diego, bringing positive publicity to the city and its revitalized waterfront and Gaslamp Quarter. The convention committee, however, overran its budget by some $20 million, largely because of the extra costs of security.

Due to the limited ceiling height of the convention hall, the podium was elevated a mere above the convention floor, significantly lower than the podium had been elevated at the preceding 1992 Republican convention. Due to the small space in the convention hall, thousands of credentialed convention-goers were relegated to watching the convention via television screens in secondary rooms in the convention complex.

&quot;&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Republican Party planning of the convention&#x27;s prime time programming to be a &quot;tightly packaged, carefully scripted format&quot; and a &quot;fast-paced program, replete with cutaways, taped segments and slick videos, in an effort to maximize air time for their partisan message.&quot; Except for the acceptance and keynote speeches, speakers were generally allotted no more than five minutes to speak. To warn speakers when their allotted speaking time was running out, a light was mounted on the podium. The convention even built its schedule to anticipate and accommodate commercial breaks on the networks broadcasting the convention live.
To ensure that some television audiences would see uncut extended coverage of the convention with a strictly pro-Republican slant, the Republican National Committee purchased television time on The Family Channel to air its &quot;GOP-TV&quot; coverage commercial free from 9am to 11pm for the duration of the convention. The Family Channel was owned by Pat Robertson, who was prominently involved in Republican politics. The Republican Party also purchased a half hour of morning broadcast time on USA Network on five days during the convention week.

One of the chief Dole operatives tasked with overseeing convention preparations was Paul Manafort.

The cost associated with setting up the convention hall itself were reported to be between $5 million and $7 million.

The federal government provided both conventions with $12.3 million in funding in 1996.

Johnson &amp; Higgins provided liability insurance coverage for the convention.

==Party platform==
Despite speeches at the convention having a more moderate and inclusive tone, the party platform adopted at the 1996 convention catered the conservative ideological right.

==Convention speakers==
John Marelius of the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; described the convention&#x27;s lineup of speakers as portraying a, &quot;diverse, inclusive Republican Party of stirring orators, women, minorities, disabled people and Democrats who switched parties.&quot; Marelius regarded the convention as contrasting with the preceding 1992 Republican convention, which had given prominent platform for Pat Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;religious war&quot;. Some religious conservatives took issue with the sparse inclusion of &quot;pro-life&quot; (anti-abortion) rhetoric in the convention. Pat Buchanan was denied a speaking slot at the convention.

===Notable speeches===
====Bob Dole&#x27;s presidential nomination acceptance speech====
Dole&#x27;s acceptance speech provided a heavy focus on the issue of trust, highlighting not just the need for the American public to have trust in government, but also the need for the government to have trust in the American public. Dole declared, &quot;the fundamental issue is not of policy, but of trust -- not merely whether the people trust the president, but whether the president and his party trust the people, trust in their goodness and their genius for recovery. For the government cannot direct the people, the people must direct the government.&quot;

In his speech, Dole denounced intolerance, including racism and religious intolerance. Dole declared the Republican to be, &quot;broad and inclusive,&quot; claiming that it represented, &quot;many streams of opinion and many points of view&quot;. Dole exclaimed, &quot;if there’s anyone who has mistakenly attached themselves to our party in the belief that we are not open to citizens of every race and religion, then let me remind you — tonight this hall belongs to the party of Lincoln, and the exits, which are clearly marked, are for you to walk out of as I stand this ground without compromise.&quot;

In comments that were seen as partially alluding to his longevity of age; Dole who at the age of 74, was older than any previous United States president had been when elected to their first term, hailed himself as prospectively being, &quot;the bridge to a time of tranquility, faith and confidence in action,&quot; exclaiming, &quot;to those who say it was never so, that America had not been better, I say, you&#x27;re wrong, and I know. Because I was there. I have seen it. I remember.&quot;

Dole touted the value of political compromise, proclaiming, &quot;in politics, honorable compromise is no sin. It is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance.&quot;

Dole characterized his Democratic opponent, incumbent president Bill Clinton, as having failed to, &quot;provide for our future defense&quot; in regards to defense spending.

Dole issued negative characterizations of a varied array of groups and elements, including attacks on teachers unions, liberal judges, criminals, and government bureaucracies. Dole negatively characterized the book &quot;It Takes a Village&quot; (which was written by First Lady Hillary Clinton, the wife of Dole&#x27;s Democratic opponent Bill Clinton) as calling for state collectivist childcare, which he argued ran counter to the concept of family responsibility.

Dole mentioned having talked on the phone that day with former president Ronald Reagan (who was absent from the convention due to his Alzheimers condition) and declared that he had promised that he would &quot;win one more for the Gipper.&quot; (an allusion to Reagan&#x27;s role in Knute Rockne, All American).

Dole&#x27;s speech was written over a period of several months. However, days before he was scheduled to deliver it, four aides of Dole were brought in to overhaul the speech&#x27;s conclusion.

The &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reviewed Dole&#x27;s speech as making, &quot; his strongest case yet,&quot; for why he should become president&#x27; The &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial board gave the speech a mixed review, describing it as illustrating, &quot;both the strengths and the weaknesses&quot; of Dole&#x27;s candidacy. It took issue on Dole&#x27;s criticism of Clinton&#x27;s defense spending as insufficient, arguing that with his proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, Dole was, &quot;in no position to declare that he will spend more&quot; on defense spending. John Marelius of the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; characterized the speech as lacking either, &quot;soaringly memorable language or a thematic spine.&quot; However, he also opined that, by highlighting the issue of mutual trust government and the public, Dole articulated, &quot;a rationale for his candidacy that had so often been missing on the campaign trail.&quot; The Chicago Tribune&#x27;s editorial board, in its endorsement of Dole, hailed Dole&#x27;s &quot;eloquent&quot; remarks against religious and racial intolerance.

==== Jack Kemp&#x27;s vice presidential nomination acceptance speech ====
Jack Kemp, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the George H. W. Bush administration, gave his acceptance speech of the 1996 Republican vice presidential nomination right before Bob Dole gave his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination.

====Elizabeth Dole ====
Presidential nominee Bob Dole&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, spoke at the convention. In tandem with his Democratic opponent Bill Clinton&#x27;s wife, Hillary Clinton, later speaking at the Democratic convention, 1996 became the year in which it became established practice that both major party candidates spouses speak at their party&#x27;s convention. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; observed in 1996, &quot;Although not unheard of, wives of nominees do not routinely address presidential conventions.&quot;

Dole opted to deliver her speech from the convention floor rather than from atop of the stage, even walking among some of the delegates during parts of her speech. This was an unusual staging for a convention speech that was likened to having optics resembling the format of an American daytime talk show. After she experienced technical difficulties with her lavalier microphone early into her speech, she was given a wireless handheld microphone. Her twenty-minute speech was much longer than any other speech delivered on that night of the convention. Her speech served to better humanize Bob Dole in the eyes of the American electorate. To further this, before her speech, Bob Dole&#x27;s daughter Robin Dole had spoken for five minutes. Dole&#x27;s speech recounted the life of her husband as well as her relationship with her husband.
====Susan Molinari&#x27;s keynote address====
U.S. Representative and Vice Chair of the House Republican Conference Susan Molinari delivered the convention&#x27;s keynote address.

Molinari&#x27;s speech spoke of mothers like herself being, &quot;stretched to the limit, trying to hold down a job while trying to hold down the fort at home, too,&quot; faulting Clinton for passing what she claimed was &quot;the largest tax increase in history.&quot; Faulting Clinton, she claimed that, &quot;now Americans pay almost 40 cents of every dollar they earn in taxes, the most ever. Every year Bill Clinton&#x27;s been in office, taxes have been higher, and family incomes have been lower.&quot; She painted the Dole-Kemp ticket as offering an alternative to the scenario that she characterized.

Molinari assailed Clinton as failing to fulfill the campaign promises he had been elected on in 1992, prefacing her speech with the quip, &quot;This speech is a lot like a Bill Clinton promise: It won&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;ll sound like a Republican talking,&quot; and later quipping that, &quot;Americans know that Bill Clinton&#x27;s promises have the life span of a Big Mac on Air Force One. While that tag line may be funny, what&#x27;s not funny is what he is doing to the promise of America.&quot;

CNN described Molinari&#x27;s speech, which frequently mentioned her 3-month-old daughter and the children of other individuals, as perhaps intending to help lessen the gender gap shown in polls of women voters favoring the Democratic ticket.
====George H. W. Bush====
Former president George H. W. Bush, who been unseated in the previous 1992 election, delivered a speech on the convention&#x27;s opening night.

====Gerald Ford====
Former president Gerald Ford, who had selected Dole as his vice presidential running mate in the 1976 United States presidential election, delivered a short speech on the convention&#x27;s opening night.

Ford, in light of the Republican ticket trailing by double-digits in the polls at the time of the 1996 Republican National Convention, reminded voters that the 1976 Ford-Dole ticket gained 30 points in the polls before November 1976.

In his remarks, Ford made an automobile pun, quipping, &quot;a few years ago, when I suddenly found myself President, I said I was a Ford, not a Lincoln. Today, what we have in the White House is neither a Ford or a Lincoln. What we have is a convertible Dodge. Isn&#x27;t it time for a trade-in?&quot;.
====Colin Powell====
Retired general Colin Powell delivered a speech on the convention&#x27;s opening night. This was Powell&#x27;s first major partisan political speech. Powell had only formally joined the Republican Party the previous year. Powell&#x27;s speech was largely a call for compassion and inclusion, and touched on his upbringing by parents who were black immigrants from Jamaica. In endorsing Dole, Powell did not directly attack the Democratic ticket.

====Nancy Reagan====

The wife of former president Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan, spoke at the convention, expressing gratitude.

====Stephen Fong====
On the closing night of the convention, Stephen Fong, then-president of the San Francisco chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans, spoke at the dais as part of a series of speeches from &quot;mainstreet Americans,&quot; but was not publicly identified as gay. Fong was the first openly gay speaker at a Republican National Convention.

==Musical performances==
Among the musical performances at the convention was an August 15 performance by the &quot;Singing Senators&quot; (Senators Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, Larry Craig, and Jim Jeffords) who sang a barbershop quartet version of the song Elvira in dedication to Elizabeth Dole.

==Presidential nomination roll call vote==
Senator John McCain placed Bob Dole&#x27;s name in nomination.
==Vice presidential nominating vote==
New York Governor George Pataki placed Jack Kemp&#x27;s name into nomination, after which the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
was nominated by voice vote.

==Impact==
On August 16, the day after the close convention, John Marelius of the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; characterized different polls as showing conflicting indicators as to whether Dole was rising or declining in the polls.

Ever since the 1996 election, in which both the Democratic and Republican conventions featured the spouses of the presidential nominees as speakers, it had become standard practice that both major parties feature the spouses of their presidential nominees as convention speakers. This convention stood uninterrupted until the 2024 Republican National Convention, at which Republican nominee Donald Trump&#x27;s wife (Melania Trump) did not speak.

<doc id="715796" wikidata="Q115256" url="?curid=715796" title="Taoyuan, Taiwan">
<text>Taoyuan () is a special municipality located in northwestern Taiwan, neighboring New Taipei City to the north-east, Yilan County to the south-east, and Hsinchu County to the south-west. Taoyuan District is the seat of the municipal government and which, along with Zhongli District, forms a large metropolitan area. Taoyuan developed from a satellite city of Taipei metropolitan area to become the fourth-largest metropolitan area, and fifth-largest populated city in Taiwan. &quot;Taoyuan&quot; literally means &quot;peach garden&quot; in Chinese, since the area used to have many peach trees. Formerly a county, Taoyuan became the latest new founding special municipality in 2014.

Taoyuan City is home to many industrial parks and tech company headquarters. Due to the city&#x27;s proximity to Taipei, and the lower cost of living, Taoyuan has had the fastest population growth of any city in Taiwan in recent decades. The city is also home to 116,000 foreign workers, with many coming from Southeast Asia and working in factories or as household caregivers. Taoyuan International Airport, which serves the capital, Taipei and the rest of northern Taiwan, is located in this city.

==History==

===Early history===
In ancient times, the Taoyuan plateau was the home of the Taiwanese plains aborigines. In prehistory, the Ketagalan people settled in &quot;&quot;. In the early years of Dutch colonization, Spanish colonization, and Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty, there were no large-scale cultivation or industrial activities. During the Qing era, a number of people from Fujian Province and Guangdong province began to immigrate into present-day Taoyuan to develop and farm the land. They planted peach trees, which, when fully bloomed in spring, were so beautiful that the people named the land &quot;Toahong&quot; ().

===Empire of Japan===
In November 1901, during Japanese era, a local administrative office, , was established in the area, and renamed in 1905. In 1920, the &quot;Tōen&quot; area was incorporated into Shinchiku Prefecture.

During the Japanese era, the staged migration policy caused Taoyuan to develop into a city with a variety of cultures. For example, temples and worship paths (currently the Taoyuan Martyrs Shrine) symbolized cultural systems. were used to represent military systems, and the old Taoyuan City Office signified political systems.

===Republic of China===
After the transfer from Japan to the Republic of China, the present day-area of Taoyuan City was incorporated under Hsinchu County. In 1950, Taoyuan County was established by separating it from Hsinchu County. On 21 April 1971, Taoyuan City was made the county seat of Taoyuan County. It had 6 cities, 1 urban township and 6 rural townships.

In June 2009, the Executive Yuan approved the plan to upgrade Taoyuan from a county to a special municipality. On 25 December 2014, Taoyuan County was upgraded into a special municipality of Taoyuan City ().

==Geography==
Taoyuan is located approximately southwest of Taipei, in northern Taiwan, and occupies . It is made up of low-lying plains, interconnected mountains and plateaus. Its shape has a long and narrow southeast-to-northwest trend, with the southeast in the Xueshan Range and the far end on the shores of the Taiwan Strait.

There are many irrigation ponds at Taoyuan Plateau, which caused Taoyuan to earn the nickname &quot;Thousand-pond Township&quot; ().

===Climate===
Taoyuan has a humid subtropical climate, with mild to warm winters and hot summers, typical of northern Taiwan.

==Ethnic composition==

===Han Chinese===

====Hoklo====

<text>Ñeembucú (; Guaraní: &quot;Ñe&#x27;ẽmbuku&quot;) is a department located in the south of the Eastern Region of Paraguay. The capital is Pilar. The department is almost entirely rural, and is home to some of the oldest and best-preserved Jesuit ruins, which are located near the town of Humaitá.

==Districts==

The department is divided in 16 districts:
# Alberdi
# Cerrito
# Desmochados
# General José Eduvigis Díaz
# Guazú Cuá
# Humaitá
# Isla Umbú
# Laureles
# Mayor José J. Martinez
# Paso de Patria
# Pilar
# San Juan Bautista del Ñeembucú
# Tacuaras
# Villa Franca
# Villa Oliva
# Villalbín
==Geography==
===Land===
The terrain in Ñeembucú is markedly flat, covered mostly in flat, grassy fields only broken by the occasional wetland swamp or green &quot;monte&quot;. Montes, despite their name, are not mountains at all, but patches of dense trees and brush that provide shade to the cattle who graze on the flat plains surrounding them. Almost all of the land in Ñeembucú is used for grazing (cattle, sheep) or other types of agriculture.

===Borders===
To the west, Ñeembucú is limited by the Rio Paraguay and Argentina, to the south by the Rio Paraná and Argentina, to the north by the Central department, and to the east by the departments of Paraguarí and Misiones.

==History==
Ñeembucú was the theatre of the second phase of the War of the Triple Alliance. Battles fought there included Tuyutí, Curupaytí, the Boquerón del Sauce and Humaitá.

<text>Paraguarí (; Guaraní: Paraguari) is a &quot;departamento&quot; in Paraguay. At the 2002 census it had a population of 221,932. The capital is the city of Paraguarí.

== History ==
The territory which forms this department is located in a valley formerly called &quot;Yarigua&#x27;a&quot; that was part of the mission of Jesuit priests in the era of colonization.

Numerous villages existed in this area, whose inhabitants were influenced by priests and chaplains responsible for directing agricultural and livestock activities.

Part of the territory was occupied also by the Dominican missionaries who were responsible for &quot;Tavapy&quot; with black people.

At the end of the 16th century, the Franciscan missionaries founded the city of Yaguarón with indigenous Guaraní.

During the government of Don Carlos Antonio López this territory benefited by the opening of railways in 1854. Once the Paraguayan War, the tracks reached Villarrica, which generated the founding of new cities like Cerro León, Escobar, Sapucai and General Bernardino Caballero.

Over time, people formed two lines, which were on the brink of the route and those who were along the railroad tracks. This situation contributed to the formation of two separate departments in 1906, Quiindy with the cities of Paraguarí and routes that was formed by the towns of Carapegua, Tavapy, General Bernardino Caballero, Escobar, Yaguarón, Pirayú, Ypacaraí and Itauguá, the latter two belonging to the department at present Central.

<text>Medical Information Technology, Inc., shortened to Meditech, is a privately held Massachusetts-based software and service company that develops and sells information systems for healthcare organizations.

==History==
In 1969, Neil Pappalardo began developing the programming language MIIS. This was one of several proprietary implementations of MUMPS, a programming language which had not yet been standardized. 

In July of that year, Pappalardo, Morton E. Ruderman, Curtis W. Marble, Jerome H. Grossman, and Edward B. Roberts founded the company, with a $500,000 investment from EG&amp;G. Between 1971 and 1979, Pappalardo developed various other systems, but those associated with integrated healthcare information remained his primary focus.

In 1982, Meditech adopted the then-new MAGIC operating system/programming language for its health care information systems. In 1994, the company adopted client/server, a second software platform. While client/server utilized the same programming language, MAGIC runs all code on a central server, and clients are in effect dumb terminals. Client/server executes the code on a user&#x27;s PC, although all code remained centralized. Client-server supports only Microsoft Windows-based operating systems. Meditech announced its version 6.0 in 2006.

In 2003, Howard Messing was named president, and in 2010 became chief executive officer.

MEDITECH announced the launch of Expanse, the company’s mobile, web-based EHR, on February 27, 2018.

On January 29, 2020, Meditech announced the launch of Expanse Patient Care, a web-based application software that allows nurses and therapists to conduct administrative tasks through a mobile device.

In 2021, Michelle O’Connor was named president and chief executive officer.

== Acquisitions ==
In 2007, Meditech acquired Patient Care Technologies, Inc. (PtCT) and the merger was completed effective December 31, 2009.

In 2011, Meditech acquired LSS Data Systems, Inc. (LSS) after partnering since 1982. The merger was completed effective December 31, 2013.

Meditech acquired UK-based Centennial Computer Corporation in 2018.

==Products and services==

Meditech offers software for healthcare organizations of various types and sizes. Some of the software modules include: Health Information Management, Revenue Cycle, Scanning and Archiving, Scheduling and Referral Management, as well as others.

==Partnerships==
Meditech South Africa, founded in 1982, provides software and services to the healthcare industry in Africa and the Middle East. On June 6, 2012, Meditech announced its partnership with Intelligent Medical Objects to provide mapping of clinician-friendly diagnosis and procedure terminologies to billing codes and medical concepts.

==Locations==
Meditech owns several facilities in eastern Massachusetts, located in Westwood, Canton, Fall River, and Foxborough. Meditech also has a facility in Atlanta, Georgia that was the former offices of Patient Care Technologies (PtCT), which is chiefly responsible for the company&#x27;s Home Care line of clinical and billing software. Meditech also owns a building in Minnetonka, Minnesota along with global offices in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and Singapore.

<doc id="715813" wikidata="Q4587881" url="?curid=715813" title="1992 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1992 Republican National Convention was held in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, from August 17 to August 20, 1992. The convention nominated President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle for reelection. It was Bush&#x27;s fourth consecutive appearance as a candidate on a major party ticket; only Bush and Franklin D. Roosevelt have been nominated on four consecutive presidential tickets. Richard Nixon and Roosevelt were nominated five times, but not consecutively.

==Site selection==
The two finalist cities that Houston had defeated to land the convention were New Orleans and San Diego. While Houston was the adopted hometown of the incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush, when the location was announced, the party insisted that Bush had not used his influence to land the city the convention, and had only instructed the party to choose &quot;the best site&quot; for the convention. Unsuccessful finalist city New Orleans had been the location of the previous Republican National Convention in 1988.

===Bids===
==Venue logistics==
The Astrodome had been renovated recently before its selection as the convention&#x27;s location. For the convention, the stadium was arranged to seat 36,000 people.

To accommodate the convention and its set-up, the Houston Astros, the Major League Baseball team which played at the Astrodome, played 26 consecutive away games over 28 days, the longest Major League Baseball &quot;road trip&quot; since the Philadelphia Phillies played 27 away games in 28 days in 1944. Additionally, the National Football League&#x27;s Houston Oilers would also be forced to play all their preseason games on the road. The Major League Baseball Players Association had filed an unsuccessful grievance in October 1991 in an attempt to block the planned 26-game road trip by the Astros. The Major League Baseball Players Association took issue with the Houston Sports Association (owners of the Astrodome) renting the stadium to the Republican National Convention organizers from July 27 through August 23, 1992, without first seeking permission from the National League, and their grievance sought to shorten the length of the road trip, arguing that the 26-game road trip went against the National League&#x27;s constitution.

==Overview==
The convention is notable in that it featured the last major address of the long political career of former President Ronald Reagan, Bush&#x27;s predecessor. In his speech, Reagan told Americans that:
As the economy was in a recession and domestic affairs in general had dramatically decayed, the GOP lagged in the polls by double digits behind the Bill Clinton–Al Gore Democratic ticket after a successful Democratic Convention, and with Ross Perot temporarily out of the race, the Republican Party worked hard to rally its base of social conservatives. Pat Buchanan&#x27;s opening night &quot;culture war&quot; speech argued that a great battle of values was taking place in the United States. Republican National Committee chairman Rich Bond (referring to Democrats) claimed that &quot;we are America, they are not America.&quot; Marilyn Quayle dismissed Bill Clinton&#x27;s claim to a new generation of leadership by saying, &quot;Not everyone demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual revolution or dodged the draft.&quot; Regarding Buchanan&#x27;s speech, liberal humorist Molly Ivins quipped that it &quot;probably sounded better in the original German.&quot; Twenty years after the convention, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Supporters of Mr. Bush pointed to the tone of the convention as one of the reasons he lost re-election that November to Bill Clinton,&quot; as it centered more on Reagan-era values and Bush&#x27;s international credentials at a time that the main issue was the domestic crisis. Despite the fact that the now-infamous &quot;No new taxes&quot; pledge had haunted the President for the last three years, the economy was barely mentioned.

AIDS activist Mary Fisher, who has HIV, addressed the convention, making an eloquent plea for her cause. (She also addressed the 1996 RNC). Her 1992 speech was listed as #50 in American Rhetoric&#x27;s Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

During his acceptance speech, President Bush thanked former President Richard Nixon (during whose tenure Bush had served as a U.S. Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations and Chairman of the Republican National Committee) for his advice and contributions to the administration&#x27;s foreign policy. This would be Nixon&#x27;s last RNC, as he would die less than two years later.

Restaurateur Ninfa Laurenzo delivered the Pledge of Allegiance at the opening session on August 17, 1992.

Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin delivered the nomination speech of President Bush for re-election. The nomination was seconded by J. C. Watts.

The stadium banned outside food from the convention, but set up a food court in the nearby Astroarena. The food court operations included Atchafalaya River Cafe, Bambolino&#x27;s, Frenchy&#x27;s, Luther&#x27;s Bar-B-Q, Ninfa&#x27;s, PeaColes, and Tommy&#x27;s Burgers. Some restaurant owners had connections with the Houston Host Committee, the group in charge of the vendor market of the Astroarena, and Republican Party officials. The hot dogs and soft drinks sold by the Astrodome&#x27;s official caterer, Harry M. Stevens, were not present during the convention. Vendors at the convention paid Stevens a fee so they could sell food at the convention, as specified in Stevens&#x27; contract with the Astrodome.

==Presidential nomination roll call vote==
* George H. W. Bush 2,166
* Patrick J. Buchanan 18
* Alan Keyes 1

==Vice presidential nomination vote==
* Dan Quayle was renominated by voice vote.

==Aftermath==
The convention energized the Republican base, giving the Bush-Quayle ticket a bounce in the polls. As the bounce faded, the race returned to a lopsided double-digit Clinton–Gore lead. The race narrowed considerably, however, when Ross Perot rebooted his insurgent campaign.

The major parties have avoided hosting their conventions at baseball stadiums since then, now holding them in non sports venues (such as convention centers) and venues for teams whose seasons are not currently in play at the time of the convention.

<text>Presidente Hayes () is a department in Paraguay. The capital is the city of Villa Hayes. The department was named after U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, who awarded the territory to Paraguay while arbitrating a boundary dispute between Paraguay and Argentina after the Paraguayan War.

== Districts ==

The department is divided into eight districts:

# Benjamín Aceval
# Campo Aceval
# General Bruguez
# José Falcón
# Nanawa (Puerto Elsa)
# Nueva Asunción (Chaco’í)
# Puerto Pinasco
# Teniente Esteban Martínez
# Teniente Primero Manuel Irala Fernández
# Villa Hayes

== History ==

In the colonial period, conflicts between settlers and native tribes resulted in the abandonment of towns and missions including Melodía, Timbó, Naranjajay, and Remolinos.

Only Fort Borbon, today called Fort Olimpo, survived. Founded during the government of Joaquín Alós y Brú, the garrison contained the southern advance of the Portuguese.

French settlers tried but failed to settle the area, with the exception of Villa Occidental.

After the Paraguayan War of 1864–1870, U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes arbitrated a boundary dispute between Argentina and Paraguay and ultimately awarded the territory to Paraguay in 1878. In gratitude, Paraguay renamed the department as &quot;Presidente Hayes&quot;.

In 1906, during the political division of Paraguay, the department was divided into two regions, Oriental and Occidental. The latter was divided in military headquarters that depended on the War and Marine Ministry.

Important dates for this department include June 12 (Chaco Peace Day), September 29 (Boquerón Victory Day) and November 12 (Laudo Hayes Firm Day).

Pozo Colorado was named the capital in 1988. However, the capital was changed to Villa Hayes in 1999.

==Geography==
=== Borders ===

Located between parallels 22° 03′ and 25° 20′ of South latitude and the meridians 57° 15′ and 61° 00′ of longitude West.

* To the North: Alto Paraguay department, from which is separated by the road of the railway from &quot;km 160&quot; to &quot;km 20&quot;, from this point by an imaginary straight line until Paraguay River.
* To the South: Formosa Province, Argentina, from which is separated by the Pilcomayo River, all the way from its flow into the Paraguay River to the San Lorenzo Mission.
* To the East: the departments Concepción, San Pedro, Cordillera and Central; Presidente Hayes is separated from them by the Paraguay River, from its flow into the La Paz River until the Pilcomayo River.
* To the West: Boquerón department, separated by the road that connects the San Lorenzo Mission with the Forts Gral. Díaz, Avalos Sánchez, Zenteno, Dr. Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, Boquerón, Isla Poí and Casanillo, and from this point with an imaginary straight line until &quot;km 160&quot;.

=== Climate ===

The temperature reaches in summer and drops to in winter. The average temperature is . The average amount of precipitation is between annually.

=== Hydrography ===

The Paraguay River forms one border of the department. The tributary rivers Pilcomayo, San Carlos, Siete Puntas, Negro, Verde, Montelindo, Aguaray Guazú, and Confuso also flow through the department but are not navigable for big ships. To the south lies the Patiño Swamp.

The city of Villa Hayes floods frequently when the rivers overflow. The land elsewhere in the department is higher.

=== Environment ===

There are four ecosystems in the Chaco territory: the floodplain of the Paraguay River, Pozo Azul, Laguna Salada, and the Floodplain of the Pilcomayo River.

The Pilcomayo River&#x27;s deviation towards Argentina has produced several changes in the habits of the people; the drought causes the migration of the jacarés to most humid areas and spreads diseases.

Endangered flora include timbó, samu&#x27;u, white and red quebracho, and karanday and endangered fauna include carpincho, jurumi, jacaré, and tapir.

The east has saline soil and the south has calcareous soil. The hills Confuso, Siete Cabezas and Galván are small elevations.

== Economy ==
===Industry and business===

Presidente Hayes leads Paraguay in production of cattle, and is second in production of horses.

The population is heavily involved in agriculture; the department is third place in production of sorghum. Cotton and sugarcane are also agricultural products of the area; Villa Hayes and Benjamín Aceval are notable for production of sugarcane.

The sugar factory Censi and Pirota is located in Villa Hayes. Sawmills, ceramic factories and steel mills are also in the city. ACEPAR, Aceros del Paraguay, is an important iron and steel industry and is also located in Villa Hayes.

In addition, in Villa Hayes is Astillero Chaco Paraguayo S.A., a specialising in the construction of launches for heavy loads, fuel and vegetable oil transportation. There is also soap and lime factories and an ESSO plant of fuel and lubricants.

Puerto Falcón trades heavily with Argentina and also sees a lot of tourism. Tinfunqué National Park is a major tourist attraction with an area of 280,000 hectares.

=== Transportation and services ===

The most important way of transportation is Route No. 9 &quot;Carlos Antonio López&quot; also known as &quot;Transchaco&quot;, which cross the Paraguay River through the Remanso Bridge and extends to Bolivia.

The Route No. 12 &quot;Vice Presidente Sánchez&quot; borders Pilcomayo River, but is not passable when raining.

The road Pozo Colorado-Puerto Milirar reaches Concepción, crossing the Paraguay River through a bridge.

The different roads that connect portions of the department have the inconvenience of being impassable during the rainy season.

Paraguay River is the most used way to communicate with Puerto Pinasco.

In Puerto Falcón, is possible the communication with the Argentine city Clorinda through the San Ignacio de Loyola International Bridge.

The cattle establishments use aerial ways.

There are two FM radio stations, Radio Villa Hayes and Dyon. About 3,200 people have phone service.

There are 16,865 households in the department, 6,165 in the urban area, and 10,700 in the rural area. The percentage of which count with basic facilities are the following:

* Electric power: 39.9%
* Running water: 19.1%
* Trash collection: 4.3%

=== Health and education ===

There are 38 hospitals and health care centers.

== Flag ==

The flag of the state is a simple green and white triband. Originally, the department&#x27;s flag was a white flag with a green border and two diagonal stripes from the top-right and top-left corners touching a coat of arms design, but at some point it was replaced with the current one.

<doc id="715817" wikidata="Q2704885" url="?curid=715817" title="2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom">
<text>The 2004 European Parliament election was the United Kingdom&#x27;s part of the wider 2004 European Parliament election which was held between 10 and 13 June 2004 in the 25 member states of the European Union. The United Kingdom&#x27;s part of this election was held on Thursday 10 June 2004. The election also coincided with the 2004 local elections and the London Assembly and mayoral elections. In total, 78 Members of the European Parliament were elected from the United Kingdom using proportional representation.

The Conservative Party and the Labour Party both polled poorly. The Conservatives experienced their second-lowest ever recorded vote share in a national election (even less than their 1832 nadir, although the party would do worse still in the 2014 and 2019 elections), and Labour their lowest since 1918. The UK Independence Party (UKIP) saw a large increase in support, increasing its number of MEPs from 3 to 12 and on popular vote pushed the Liberal Democrats, who themselves had increased their representation from 10 to 12 seats into fourth place. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin beat the SDLP in the polls and took its first Northern Ireland seat.

==Background==

===Electoral system===
The United Kingdom elected 78 Members of the European Parliament using proportional representation. The United Kingdom was divided into twelve multi-member constituencies. The eleven of these regions which form Great Britain used a closed-list party list system method of proportional representation, calculated using the D&#x27;Hondt method. Northern Ireland used the Single Transferable Vote (STV). As a consequence of the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, the number of seats allocated to the United Kingdom was fewer than in 1999.

It was the first European election to be held in the United Kingdom using postal-only voting in four areas: the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, and East Midlands
regions.

===Regional seat allocations===
A combination of the effects of the Treaty of Nice and the 2004 enlargement of the European Union meant that the number of seats allocated to the United Kingdom for the 2004 election was reduced from the 87 MEPs allocated for the 1999 election to 78 MEPs.

As a result of the successful challenge of &quot;Matthews v United Kingdom&quot; before the European Court of Human Rights in 1999 residents of Gibraltar, voted in the European Parliament election for the first time, as part of the South West England region.

==Results==
Turnout for all the regions was 38.2% on an electorate of 44,157,267 (43,084,598 in Great Britain and 1,072,669 in Northern Ireland). The Conservatives and Labour both polled poorly. The Conservatives, although getting a vote share 4.1% greater than Labour, experienced their lowest vote share in a national election since 1832. Labour&#x27;s vote share was its lowest since 1918. Labour&#x27;s decline in votes was regarded as being largely due to widespread public dissatisfaction about the Iraq War and (as with the Conservatives) the increased popularity of UK Independence Party (UKIP). UKIP saw a large increase in support, increasing its number of MEPs from 3 to 12, drawing level with the Liberal Democrats, who themselves had increased their representation from 10 to 12 seats. UKIP polled higher than the Liberal Democrats to push the latter into fourth place.

Turnout was lowest in Scotland, which did not hold local elections on the same day. In Scotland, Labour topped the poll, followed by the Scottish National Party (SNP). The Conservatives&#x27; share of the vote declined by 2 per cent, making it the region with the smallest swing against them.

Wales was the only region were Labour increased its share of the vote compared to 1999. The Conservatives managed to make gains pushing Plaid Cymru into third and whose share of the vote fell by 12 percentage points relative to 1999. Similarly UKIP narrowly beat the Liberal Democrats into fourth place. Wales was the region where the Green Party polled their lowest share of the vote.

===Gibraltar===

Gibraltar participated in the United Kingdom&#x27;s election for the first time in 2004 as part of the South West England constituency. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory (BOT) and therefore is under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom but does not form part of it. Gibraltar was however part of the EU, the only BOT to be so included. Following however, the result of the successful challenge of &quot;Matthews v United Kingdom&quot; before the European Court of Human Rights in 1999 residents of Gibraltar were given the right to vote in the European Parliament elections. The British government decided not to give Gibraltar its own seat due to its small electorate of just over 20,000 which would have meant with just one seat Gibraltar would have been over-represented by about 30 times the average.

None of the main Gibraltar political parties contested the election, so voters chose from United Kingdom party lists. However, Lyana Armstrong-Emery of Gibraltar&#x27;s Reform Party had a place on a joint list with the Green Party. In addition both the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, and his deputy, Michael Ancram, campaigned in Gibraltar.

Turnout in Gibraltar was 57.5%, higher than the 37.6% for the South West England electoral region as a whole. The Conservative Party polled over two-thirds of the Gibraltar vote, with no other party exceeding 10% support.

===Northern Ireland===
Turnout in Northern Ireland was 51.2%. Sinn Féin beat the SDLP in the polls and took its first Northern Ireland seat. Sinn Féin also won a seat in the corresponding elections in the Republic of Ireland. Sinn Féin and the DUP increased their shares of the vote relative to the 1999 European Parliament elections, while the shares for both the SDLP and the UUP fell. This was also the final election in which a Unionist candidate topped the poll in Northern Ireland. Jim Allister of the DUP and Bairbre de Brún of Sinn Féin were elected in the first round while Jim Nicholson of the UUP was elected in the third stage, after the votes of the other candidates were reallocated.

==Aftermath==
Both Tony Blair and Michael Howard faced criticism for their results with then Secretary of State for Health John Reid calling the results &quot;disappointing&quot; for Labour and &quot;disastrous&quot; for the Conservatives.

Shortly after the election UKIP&#x27;s Robert Kilroy-Silk, who was credited with raising the profile of the party during the election, was interviewed by Channel 4 television about leadership ambitions, Kilroy-Silk did not deny having ambitions to lead the party, but stressed that Roger Knapman would lead it into the next general election. However, the next day, on &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot;, he criticised Knapman&#x27;s leadership. After further disagreement with the leadership, Kilroy-Silk resigned the UKIP whip in the European Parliament on 27 October 2004. Initially, he remained a member, while seeking a bid for the party leadership. However, this was not successful and he resigned completely from UKIP on 20 January 2005, calling it a &quot;joke&quot;. Two weeks later, he founded his own party, Veritas, taking a number of UKIP members, including both of the London Assembly members, with him.

UKIP formed a new European Parliament Group, Independence/Democracy which was co-chaired by Nigel Farage and Hanne Dahl.

<doc id="715818" wikidata="Q485885" url="?curid=715818" title="Pierluigi Collina">
<text>Pierluigi Collina (; born 13 February 1960) is an Italian former football referee. He was named &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Referee&quot; by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics six consecutive times from 1998 to 2003.

Collina is still involved in football as an unpaid consultant to the Italian Football Referees Association (AIA), the Head of Referees for the Football Federation of Ukraine since 2010, a member of the UEFA Referees Committee, and Chairman of the FIFA referees committee.

==Refereeing career==
Collina was born in Bologna and attended the University of Bologna, graduating with a degree in economics in 1984. During his teenage years, he played as a centre-back for a local team, but was persuaded in 1977 to take a referee&#x27;s course, where it was discovered that he had a particular aptitude for the job. Within three years he was officiating at the highest level of regional matches, while also completing his compulsory military service. In 1988, he progressed more rapidly than normal to the national third division, Serie C1 and Serie C2. After three seasons, he was promoted to officiating Serie B and Serie A matches.

Around this time, Collina developed a severe form of alopecia, resulting in the permanent loss of all his facial hair, giving him his distinctive bald appearance and earning the nickname &quot;Kojak&quot;.

In 1995, after officiating at 43 Serie A matches, he was placed on FIFA&#x27;s Referees List. He was allocated five matches at the 1996 Olympic Games, including the final between Nigeria and Argentina. He refereed the 1999 UEFA Champions League final between Bayern Munich and Manchester United; he cited this as his most memorable game because of the cheers at the end, which he described as a &quot;lions&#x27; roar&quot;.

In June 2002, Collina reached the pinnacle of his career, when he was chosen to officiate the World Cup final, between Brazil and Germany. Prior to the game, Germany&#x27;s Oliver Kahn told the &quot;Irish Times&quot;: &quot;Collina is a world-class referee, there&#x27;s no doubt about that, but he doesn&#x27;t bring luck, does he?&quot; Kahn was referring to two previous high-profile matches that Collina had refereed which involved Kahn: the aforementioned 1999 UEFA Champions League final, a 2–1 defeat for Bayern; and Germany&#x27;s 5–1 defeat against England in September 2001. Kahn&#x27;s luck did not change in the final, and his team lost 2–0.

He refereed the 2004 UEFA Cup Final between Valencia and Marseille. UEFA Euro 2004 was his last major international tournament, as in February 2005, he reached the mandatory retirement age. His last international match was Portugal against Slovakia, a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier at Estádio da Luz in Lisbon.

The FIGC raised its mandatory retirement age to 46 in order to accommodate Collina for a further season. However, a dispute emerged between the federation and Collina early in August 2005, following his decision to sign a sponsorship deal with Opel (also advertising for Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom – both were owned by General Motors at the time). As Opel was also a sponsor of Serie A club A.C. Milan, the deal was seen as a conflict of interest and Collina was not allowed to referee top-flight matches in Italy. In response, he handed in his resignation, effectively ending his career. The Italian Referees Association then attempted to reject his resignation, but Collina persisted with his retirement from the league. 

Collina attracted the ire of Luciano Moggi, the Juventus executive and chief instigator of the 2006 Italian football scandal. Collina was one of the referees that Moggi attempted to have punished for decisions that were made against Juventus. In an intercepted phone call, Moggi claimed that Collina and his colleague Roberto Rosetti were too &quot;objective&quot; and should be &quot;punished&quot; for it. As a result, he and Rosetti were two of the few referees that emerged unscathed from the scandal.

After retiring from Serie A, Collina refereed the Soccer Aid matches for charity in May 2006 and September 2008. During the latter of these games, Collina was involved in an awkward fall and was stretchered off after 21 minutes of play. He later refereed the first half of the 2010 Soccer Aid match.

His final competitive game was a Champions League qualifier between Everton and Villarreal on 24 August 2005. He announced his retirement soon after the game.

==Later career==
Collina was appointed head of referees for the Football Federation of Ukraine since 2010. His work in this position is criticised by national referees who disapprove of his lack of involvement in Ukrainian football (spending not more than two weeks per year in Ukraine) and possible tolerance towards corruption in the Ukrainian national football association.

Collina was involved in the introduction and evaluation of the video assistant referee system for the 2018 World Cup. During the tournament he pointed out the system&#x27;s effectiveness and later commented positively on its application.

==Personal life==
In 1988, Collina met his wife Gianna in Versilia. After living together almost from their meeting, they moved to the coastal town of Viareggio. Since their marriage, the couple have had two daughters. In 2003, Collina published his autobiography, &quot;My Rules of the Game (Le Mie Regole del Gioco)&quot;. In August 2005, after his retirement, he concentrated on his own business, as a financial advisor. Today he lives in Forte dei Marmi.

After refereeing the Second Round match between Japan and Turkey at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Collina became famous in Japan, and appeared in a television advert for frozen takoyaki products. He is also very popular in Turkey, as no Turkish team, national or club, lost a game with him in charge.

Although Collina is closely identified with football, his favourite sports club plays basketball. He is a lifelong supporter of local club Fortitudo Bologna. On 25 January 2010, Collina participated in a special match for supporting victims of the earthquake in Haiti between a team called &quot;Friends of Zidane and Ronaldo&quot; and Benfica in Lisbon.

==In popular culture==
===Music===
In July 2002, he appeared in cartoon form in George Michael&#x27;s video &quot;Shoot the Dog&quot;.

===Advertising===
In 2003, Collina appeared in an advert of a Turkish GSM operator, Aria, due to his popularity in Turkey. In December 2004, he starred in a commercial for MB Pivo in Serbia, alongside Lazar Ristovski. His quote in Serbian &quot;Nema cekaj Lazo, daj MB pivo&quot; (I can&#x27;t wait no longer Laza, give me MB beer) is famous in Serbia. He appeared in another MB Pivo advert two years later.

Collina&#x27;s easily-recognisable face (to followers of football) also led to his appearance in an advert for the Vauxhall Vectra on UK television during the 2006 World Cup. He also appeared in adverts for MasterCard and Adidas during the tournament.

===Video games===
Collina was chosen as the cover figure for the football video games &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 3&quot; and &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot;, appearing alongside compatriot Francesco Totti and Thierry Henry for the latter. This was unusual, as football games had come to almost exclusively feature only players and managers on their covers, and he did not feature in either game. In addition, he featured as an &quot;unlockable&quot; referee in the rival EA Sports game &quot;FIFA Football 2005&quot;, released shortly before &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot;.

==Honors==

<doc id="715819" wikidata="Q673434" url="?curid=715819" title="Ian Buchanan">
<text>Ian Buchanan (born 16 June 1957) is a British television actor who has appeared on multiple American soap operas including &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Port Charles&quot;, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, &quot;All My Children&quot;, and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. He is also known for his work in two David Lynch shows – playing Dick Tremayne in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and Lester Guy in &quot;On the Air&quot;.

==Career==
Buchanan was born in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire. After studying acting in New York at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute and privately with Marcia Haufrecht, Buchanan&#x27;s first major daytime role came in 1986, when he joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; in the role of Duke Lavery, whom he portrayed until 1989. After leaving the role of Lavery, Buchanan appeared in roles on prime-time series including &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; as Ian McFyfer from 1988 to 1990, and &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as Dick Tremayne from 1990 to 1991.

In 1990, he played Sean Brantley, a wealthy &quot;Playboy&quot;-style magazine publisher in the &quot;Columbo&quot; television series episode &quot;Columbo Cries Wolf&quot;. He also guest-starred in episode 4 of the 1990 series &quot;The Flash&quot; as the main villain, Stan Kovacs. He appeared in a 1993 episode of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, titled &quot;Blood Moon&quot;.

In 1993, Buchanan returned to daytime and was cast on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in his second most recognized daytime role as Dr. James Warwick, which he portrayed until 1999. Buchanan has since reprised his role as Warwick in several guest appearances from 2004 to 2011. Following the end of his regular appearance as Warwick, Buchanan made a short appearance on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in 2001 as Lord Sheraton.

In 2002, he joined the cast of &quot;Port Charles&quot; portraying the sinister Joshua Temple until the show&#x27;s end in 2003.

In 2005, Buchanan joined the cast of &quot;All My Children&quot;, in the role of Dr. Greg Madden, a fertility specialist involved in the controversial &quot;un-abortion&quot; storyline involving Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), as well as the abduction of the daughter of Dixie Martin (Cady McClain) and Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight). Buchanan&#x27;s role as Madden came to an end on 5 July 2006, when his character died as the result of being buried alive.

In 2012, Buchanan joined &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in the newly created contract role of Ian McAllister, who is the husband of Madison James (Sarah Brown) and a former lover of Kate Roberts DiMera, (Lauren Koslow), but was let go in August, as the result of a shift in the direction of the series.

On 27 August 2012, Buchanan returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Duke Lavery after a 23-year absence. On 12 November, it was revealed that Buchanan was playing a dual role. &quot;Duke Lavery&quot; was actually Cesar Faison in disguise, and Faison was holding the real Duke hostage at a clinic in Lucerne, Switzerland. On 5 July 2017, it was announced he would reprise his role as James Warwick on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;.

== Personal Life ==
Buchanan is openly gay, and is married to his husband Antonio Hendricks.

<doc id="715820" wikidata="Q526176" url="?curid=715820" title="San Pedro department, Paraguay">
<text>San Pedro () is a department of Paraguay. The capital is the city of San Pedro de Ycuamandiyú.

== History ==

During the 17th and 18th centuries there was even greater political and population instability than in Concepción.

The Mbayá and Payagua native tribes threatened all the area between the Ypané (in the north) and Manduvirá (in the south) Rivers and the valley by the Jejuí River.

In 1660 the natives revolted in Arecajá against the postal parcel system, causing the disappearance of this town. To help regenerate this area, the Missions San Estanislao (1749), Villa del Rosario (1786) and San Pedro de Ycuamandiyú (1786) were founded.

The second department of the country, San Pedro, was created by law in 1906, and included the territories of Itacurubí del Rosario, Santa Rosa del Aguaray, Tacuatí, Unión, Ygatimi and Curuguaty, as well as the area of Canindeyú. Its limits were defined finally in 1973.

In 1941, the Bruderhof, an Anabaptist group fleeing Nazi persecution, settled in the area of Rosario. They lived here for over 20 years, founding a hospital. They left for North America in 1966.

Is hometown of important personalities of Paraguayan history, as Vicente Ignacio Iturbe and Juana María de Lara and the musician Rosita Mello, who is from Santaní.

== Geography ==
=== Limits ===

It is located in the center of the Oriental Region, between the parallels 22º00’ and 23º30’ of latitude South and the meridians 58º00’ and 56º06’ of longitude West.

Its limits are:

* To the North: the Ypané River, which separates San Pedro from Concepción.
* To the South: the Manduvirá River and Hondo Stream, which separates it from Cordillera; also the San Joaquín Cordillera, which separates it from Caaguazú.
* To the East: the Aguaray River, the limit with Amambay, and the rivers Jejuí Guazú, Curuguaty and Corrientes, which separates San Pedro from Canindeyú.
* To the West: the Paraguay River, natural limit with Presidente Hayes.

It is the biggest department of the Oriental Region, and is mostly dedicated to agriculture, cattle and forestry.

=== Districts ===

The department is divided in 20 districts:
# Antequera

<doc id="715821" wikidata="Q4584668" url="?curid=715821" title="1988 Republican National Convention">
<text>The 1988 Republican National Convention was held in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, from August 15 to August 18, 1988. It was the second time that a major party held its convention in one of the five states known as the Deep South, coming on the heels of the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which was held in Atlanta, Georgia.


The convention nominated Vice President George Bush for president, as expected. The second spot on the ticket was not publicly known before the convention. As late as August 13, Bush had six people tabbed for consideration: House Representative Jack Kemp of New York, former United States Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole, United States Senators Bob Dole of Kansas, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Alan Simpson of Wyoming, and James Danforth &quot;Dan&quot; Quayle of Indiana. Others considered were Governors Jim Thompson of Illinois and George Deukmejian of California, but each declined consideration.

On August 16, Quayle was selected as Bush&#x27;s vice presidential running mate. The revelation of Quayle&#x27;s selection as running mate did not come until the second day of the convention, when NBC News broke the story. Until the 2024 Republican National Convention, it was the last time a major party&#x27;s presidential candidate announced his vice presidential choice during his party&#x27;s convention.

The convention featured speeches by Joe Paterno, Helen Hayes, Pat Robertson, a keynote address by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, and the music of the Jimmy Maxwell Orchestra.

The convention manager was Bill R. Phillips, former Chief of Staff of the Republican National Committee.

==Site selection==
Republicans were seeking a host city that could provide a convention venue accommodating 17,000 and 20,000 hotel rooms.

On January 20, 1987, the site selection committee voted 6–3 in recommending New Orleans to serve as the site of the party&#x27;s 1988 presidential nominating convention. The runner-up was Kansas City. Kansas City put forth Kemper Arena and the new Bartle Hall as prospective venues, with Bartle Hall seeming the more likely of the two facilities. The city&#x27;s bid, however, was challenged by its lack of the 20,000 hotel rooms sought by the Republican Party, with the city only being able to offer around 15,000 hotel rooms. A third city, Atlanta, had been ruled out of consideration because the maximum capacity configuration that the Omni Coliseum could offer would accommodate only 15,000 seats, while the Republicans were seeking a minimum of 17,000 seats.

This was the first major party presidential nominating convention to be held in New Orleans. The size of the venue, the Louisiana Superdome, excited party officials, with Party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf declaring that its size would allow a more extravagant convention to be staged. A factor that made New Orleans appealing to the Republican Party as a location included a significant supply of big hotels near the Superdome. The location choice was also intentionally reflective of the desire of the party to make further political inroads in the Southern United States.

In their contract with the city, the Republican Party included the clause forbidding the city from hosting another party&#x27;s convention. This would prevent the Democratic Party from being able to choose New Orleans as their site too. New Orleans had been bidding for the Democratic Convention as well, and Republicans feared that if the Democratic Convention was held in the same city that the host committee would treat them with second-preference. Therefore, they required the city to withdraw from bidding for the Democratic convention. New Orleans attempted to negotiate on this, but the Republicans would not cede.

The convention was the first to be held in a domed sports stadium. A 900-by-90 feet curtain, installed by Superdome management in 1986 to enable the venue to hold events like political conventions, was utilized to partition half of the venue off.

===Bids===
==Speakers==

The convention is perhaps best known for Bush&#x27;s &quot;thousand points of light&quot; speech accepting the nomination. Written by Peggy Noonan and Craig R. Smith, it included the &quot;read my lips: no new taxes&quot; pledge that was the most popular sound bite coming out of the convention. The successful speech gave him a &quot;bounce&quot; that he was able to capitalize on to win the 1988 presidential election.

President Ronald and Nancy Reagan were honored on August 15. Reagan made a major speech on the opening night of the convention, as he would for the last time in 1992.

During the presidential roll call vote, several seconding speeches were delivered, showcasing a number of speakers from varying ethnic backgrounds. Seconding speeches were delivered by American football Coach Joe Paterno, Actress Helen Hayes, Congressman Bob Dornan, restaurateur Ninfa Laurenzo, Kansas City (Missouri) City Council Member Joanne Collins, and Federal Maritime Commissioner Elaine Chao.

Other speakers included Bob Dole, Elizabeth Dole, Arizona junior senator John McCain, Jeane Kirkpatrick and former President Gerald Ford.

==Voting==
The Balloting:&lt;br&gt;
The presidential roll call began with Bush&#x27;s name being placed into nomination by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.

With rumblings of opposition to the Quayle nomination, it was decided to have it ratified by voice vote, something that the Republicans had never done before, but would become standard practice in the decades to come.

<text>Oliver Wakeman (born 26 February 1972) is an English musician, rock keyboardist and composer. He was a member of Yes from 2009 to 2011, filling the role of keyboardist previously held by his father, Rick Wakeman.

==Biography==
Oliver is the first son of Rick Wakeman and his first wife Rosaline Woolford and is the older brother of Adam Wakeman. His parents divorced when he was young.

===Solo===
He worked with Clive Nolan (of Arena) on two progressive rock concept albums, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (released 1999) and &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (released 2002). Tracy Hitchings appears on both albums, while Rick Wakeman (narrating) and Yes alumnus Peter Banks both appeared on &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. The two reconvened in 2001 to complete the tracks which were written for their abandoned 3rd album &#x27;Frankenstein&#x27;. These were released as part of the &#x27;Tales By Gaslight&#x27; Box set and as a separate stand alone release.

Wakeman worked with Steve Howe for several years (originally his father&#x27;s bandmate in Yes and later as a bandmate when Oliver joined Yes himself). The two lived fairly close to each other in south-west England. Howe guested on Wakeman&#x27;s solo album &quot;The 3 Ages of Magick&quot;, while Wakeman is on Howe&#x27;s 2005 solo album &quot;Spectrum&quot; and contributed to Howe&#x27;s recording of &quot;Australia&quot; for the US version of the Yes collection &quot;The Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversary Collection&quot;. Music from these two albums appear on two of Howe&#x27;s Box Sets.

Wakeman wrote a CD inspired by his visits to and experiences on Lundy, a small island in the Bristol Channel which was released originally in 1997 and then again in 1999. He toured with Bob Catley in the UK and Europe and also guested on an Ayreon project &quot;The Human Equation&quot; in 2004. Wakeman replaced keyboardist Herb Schildt for the American progressive rock band Starcastle, known for their Yes-like sound, at RoSfest (Rites of Spring festival) 2007.

During 2006 and 2007 Oliver took to the road with his band performing selections from his &quot;Mother&#x27;s Ruin&quot; album as well as songs from his back catalogue. In late 2007 this show was filmed and recorded in Poland and subsequently released in 2008 as a CD/DVD package and single DVD titled &quot;Coming To Town&quot;. A single CD release appeared in 2009.

Oliver has been nominated for the Classic Rock Society&#x27;s &#x27;Best Keyboard Player&#x27; award on many occasions and has won the award three times (2006, 2007 &amp; 2008).

He spent 2012 working with Gordon Giltrap on a new recording project titled &quot;Ravens &amp; Lullabies&quot; which was released in 2013. They toured together throughout September and October 2012 in preparation for the album&#x27;s release.

The tour continued throughout 2013, including a full band headline show at the Summer&#x27;s End festival. Oliver &amp; Gordon also appeared with singer Paul Manzi on Bob Harris&#x27; BBC Radio 2 show in June 2013. The tours continued throughout 2013 and 2014 saw a full band lineup recreate the Raven&#x27;s &amp; Lullabies album in full. Recordings for these concerts were released as &#x27;From A Stage&#x27; which was the 3rd CD in Wakeman&#x27;s &#x27;Collaborations&#x27; Box Set.

Oliver&#x27;s &quot;The 3 Ages of Magick&quot; was re-released in 2013 with bonus material and an expanded booklet. It was also included in the aforementioned Box Set.

Wakeman spent the new few years working on sessions for various artists as well as working on the Yes box set &#x27;From A Page&#x27;. Following the completion of the Dark Fables project Wakeman began work on his latest album &#x27;Anam Cara&#x27;. This album in due out in 2024.

===Yes===
In 2008, the official Yes website announced that Oliver Wakeman would tour with Yes in the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary tour. However, the tour was postponed due to the illness of Yes singer Jon Anderson. A revamped &quot;In the Present&quot; Tour featuring Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White of Yes plus Oliver Wakeman and Canadian singer Benoît David (filling in for Anderson) began in the fall of 2008 (under the moniker &quot;Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White of Yes&quot;), and continued into 2009 (under the name &quot;Yes&quot;). The second leg of the tour was cancelled after one date when Squire had to have an urgent leg operation on 11 February.

The band returned to touring in summer 2009 and this continued through to summer 2010. They also signed to Frontiers Records, an Italian record company. Yes started work on an album, with Wakeman, in October/November 2010 followed by a tour of South America in November/December of that year. Though he worked with the band on the initial sessions for their first album in 10 years, &quot;Fly from Here&quot;, he was dismissed from Yes during recording. Wakeman stayed on for the &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; tour (March to early April 2011) and formally left following its completion. Asia and &quot;Drama&quot; era Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes, who replaced Wakeman for the rest of the album&#x27;s sessions, was later announced as keyboardist for its upcoming summer tour. Some of Wakeman&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Fly from Here&quot; nevertheless made it onto the released version of the album, and he was credited as having co-written one track. He also appears on the Yes CD and DVD release &quot;In the Present – Live from Lyon&quot; playing all of the keyboards. Oliver also appears in the documentary film which accompanies this release.

In 2019, material Wakeman wrote and recorded with Yes was released as &quot;From a Page&quot;.

===Starcastle===
Oliver joined Starcastle for their April 2007 headlining performance at the Rites of Spring festival (ROSfest), an annual progressive rock festival in Pennsylvania.

===Strawbs===
In 2009, Wakeman joined Strawbs (another of his father&#x27;s former bands) for their tours of Canada, the UK and Italy during 2009 and 2010.

He recorded an album with the band, &quot;Dancing to the Devil&#x27;s Beat&quot; which was released in 2009.

In 2010 he appeared on the Strawbs 40th anniversary live double CD, &quot;Strawberry Fayre&quot;.

Wakeman was not with the band for their late 2010 tour given his prior commitment to recording with Yes.

<doc id="715826" wikidata="Q1337607" url="?curid=715826" title="Emily McLaughlin">
<text>Emily McLaughlin (December 1, 1928 – April 26, 1991) was an American actress, known for her long-standing role as original character Nurse Jessie Brewer on the daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1963 until 1991.

==Early life==
McLaughlin was born in White Plains, New York, where her father, Frederick C. McLaughlin, was mayor. She was educated at Middlebury College, and after studying drama, began performing in Broadway and off-Broadway productions.

==Career==

McLaughlin made her television debut in 1959, with regular role of Eileen Seaton on the daytime soap opera &quot;Young Doctor Malone&quot;. In 1961, she moved to Hollywood and began appearing with guest-starring roles on anthology dramas &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, and &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;.

===&quot;General Hospital&quot;===
From 1963 to 1991, McLaughlin starred in the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Nurse Jessie Brewer. She was cast as one of the original leading actresses on the series. Registered nurse Jessie Brewer spoke the opening line of the premiere episode, &quot;Seventh floor, nurses station&quot;, a phrase that became a staple in the show&#x27;s early years. The series&#x27; original premise centered around the drama of Brewer and Dr. Steve Hardy&#x27;s personal lives and experiences at General Hospital.

==Awards==
In 1974, McLaughlin received a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama for her role. She became the first and only actress nominated for a Golden Globe Award for a role on the daytime soap.

Her character in &quot;General Hospital&quot; was seen less and less during the 1980s. Although she wanted the steady work and to keep her job, her failing health made it difficult. She was eventually demoted to day-player status, but still retained her billing at the top of the cast crawl, behind only John Beradino as Dr. Steve Hardy. Towards the end of her life, she was only shown on the serial a few times a year, with her last appearance on the show aired on March 1, 1991, when Jessie attended the funeral of a character named Dawn Winthrop. On April 26, 1991, McLaughlin died of cancer, aged 62. She is interred next to second husband Jeffrey Hunter in the Glen Haven Memorial Park cemetery in Sylmar, California.
After her death, co-star John Beradino announced at the end of a &quot;General Hospital&quot; episode that McLaughlin had died. However, the character Jessie Brewer was never written out or referred to; she simply disappeared without explanation. Not until years later, during an anniversary episode, did Dr. Steve Hardy mention that Jessie had died.

==Personal life==
McLaughlin was married to actor Robert Lansing from 1956–1968, with whom she had a son. After their divorce, she married actor Jeffrey Hunter in February 1969. Three months after the marriage, Hunter died of a cerebral hemorrhage on May 27, aged 42.

On April 26, 1991, McLaughlin died of cancer, aged 62. She is interred next to second husband Jeffrey Hunter in the Glen Haven Memorial Park cemetery in Sylmar, California.

In 1994, McLaughlin&#x27;s daughter Mary Ann Anderson wrote and published &quot;Portrait of a Soap Star: The Emily McLaughlin Story.&quot;

<doc id="715837" wikidata="Q7865017" url="?curid=715837" title="UKeU">
<text>The UKeU (&quot;UK eUniversities Worldwide Limited&quot;) was a company and website that promoted online degrees from UK universities. UKeU delivered courses over a learning environment developed by Sun Microsystems UK.
It was set up with UK public funds under the auspices of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. It operated between 2000 and 2004 and was subsequently wound down having failed to deliver its targets.

== Brief history ==

The UKeU was first proposed as a concept by David Blunkett, then Secretary of State for Education for the UK, in a speech in February 2000, as a vehicle to deliver the best of UK higher education in online fashion across the world. The Secretary of State instructed the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to take the lead in putting this into practice.

Many universities already offered their own online courses. The Scottish universities were not part of the UKeU. The idea behind the UKeU was that it would be a broker, an agent marketing online degrees and providing a technological platform to facilitate expansion.

By late summer 2000, the key initial studies on business model, tools and markets had already been done and a shadow body, the e-University Steering Group had been established. By May 2001 many follow-up studies had been done and the operating company UK eUniversities Worldwide Limited had been incorporated; by summer 2001 an Interim Management Team had been appointed; and by October 2001 the Strategic Agreement had been signed by Sun Microsystems. By March 2002 a new chairman and CEO were in post and the Framework Agreement had been signed with Sun to commence development of the e-learning platform. Much of the cost of the UKeU was absorbed by the development of the technical platform and it was suggested that existing web-based learning platforms could have been used or adapted for use at a fraction of the cost. Sun Microsystems contributed &quot;£3.5 million of professional services and hardware&quot; rather than cash.

The UkeU did not award its own degrees, instead contracting with universities to offer theirs. The company focused on infrastructure development, course development support, quality assurance, and marketing. The target audiences were primarily international graduate students who wished to study online rather than come to the UK By March 2003 two courses had been launched, from the Open University and Sheffield Hallam University, with many further courses following in autumn 2003 making a total of 15. By January 2004 some 25 courses were recruiting students.

The first Annual Report of UKeU is no longer easy to find but there is a detailed analysis of it by OBHE still available at http://www.obhe.ac.uk/documents/2003/Articles/UK_eUniversity_annual_report_2002_03_what_more_does_it_tell_us_

==Cancellation==

It became clear however, that HEFCE had been unhappy for some months, especially with the low student numbers and the lack of private finance, and had commissioned PA Consulting to carry out a Business Review of UKeU. PA reported finally to HEFCE in January 2004 and in late February 2004 HEFCE announced to the UKeU Board and to the world that they would &quot;restructure&quot; UKeU. Although it was not announced as such at the time, this restructuring led to a rapid decline in funds and confidence and UKeU closed as an operating entity in summer 2004. It was regarded as a failure having cost £50 m and recruited only 900 students.

These received some of the most expensive degrees in history at £56,000 each. A highly critical [report https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeduski/205/20502.htm] by the UK House of Commons Select committee on Education and Skills
was published in March 2005. In an accompanying press release, Committee chairman, Barry Sheerman said: &quot;UKeU was a terrible waste of public money. The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme. Any private company which rewards underperformance of this scale would normally face severe criticism from its shareholders.&quot;

The £2m-plus wage bill for 2002 to 2003 included chief executive John Beaumont&#x27;s £180,000 salary and performance-related bonus of £44,914. UKeU&#x27;s executive directors received £100,000 in total bonuses during 2002/2003.

HEFCE identified marketing, and inadequate market research in particular, as the key cause of the failure of UKeU. Based on an assumption that there was a huge unmet demand for internet based e-learning, too much trust was put on the PwC forecast of student numbers and the general atmosphere of enthusiasm surrounding the &#x27;dot com boom&#x27; . UKeU did not undertake any market research despite spending £4.2 million on sales and marketing. There was confusion in the branding and unique selling points of the online offerings. Mainstream UK higher education at the time relied heavily on emphasising the three elements of tradition, place, and quality. Marketing by UKeU that promised &quot;the best of U.K. higher education with online convenience&quot;.

The overall concept of a &quot;UK e-University&quot; lasted 4½ years, while the company in its operational phase lasted just over two. Even by the standards of e-learning burn-outs, this was fast. Unlike in many cases in the public or quasi-public sector such as TechBC or Scottish Knowledge, there was no organisation that followed on from UKeU, even in a general sense. However, a number of small components of UKeU continued more or less unchanged as spin-offs, including the eChina Programme and the e-Learning Research Centre.

A collection of reports on UKeU were in the dim past be found on a Higher Education Academy web site.

The collection of all reports is now split between https://bacsich.org/euni/ and https://bacsich.org/ukeu-reports/

Two further volumes of reports were in preparation for release but it is believed that the release has been delayed indefinitely.

Various analyses of &quot;why UKeU failed&quot; have been produced, the most recent (2010) being https://www.academia.edu/4238152/Lessons_to_be_learned_from_the_failure_of_the_UK_e_University

<doc id="715838" wikidata="Q7170053" url="?curid=715838" title="Persecution and the Art of Writing">
<text>Persecution and the Art of Writing, published in 1952 by the Free Press, is a book of collected articles written by Leo Strauss. The book contains five previously published essays, many of which were significantly altered by Strauss from their original publication:

# Introduction
# Persecution and the Art of Writing
# The Literary Character of the &quot;Guide to the Perplexed&quot;
# The Law of Reason in the &quot;Kuzari&quot;
# How to Study Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Theologico-Political Treatise&quot;

The general theme of the book is the relationship between politics and philosophy. The thesis of the book is that many ancient and early modern political philosophers, in order to avoid persecution, hid their most heterodox ideas within their texts.

==Overview==
Strauss&#x27;s general argument — rearticulated throughout his subsequent writings, most notably in &quot;The City and Man&quot; (1964) — is that prior to the 19th century, Western scholars commonly understood that philosophical writing is not at home in any polity, no matter how liberal. Insofar as it questions conventional wisdom, philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers who believe themselves authoritative, wise, and liberal defenders of the status quo. In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, pre-modern philosophers found it necessary to convey their messages obliquely. Their &quot;art of writing&quot; was the art of esoteric communication. This is all the more apparent in medieval times, when heterodox political thinkers wrote under the threat of the Inquisition or comparably strict tribunals.

Strauss&#x27;s argument is not that medieval writers reserved one exoteric meaning for the many and an esoteric hidden meaning for the initiated few, but rather that their writings&#x27; respective core meanings extended beyond their texts&#x27; literal and/or historical dimension.

Explicitly following Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s lead, Strauss indicates that medieval political philosophers, no less than their ancient counterparts, carefully adapted their written words to the dominant moral views of their time, lest their writings be condemned as heretical or unjust — not by &quot;the many&quot; (who did not read), but by those &quot;few&quot; whom the many regarded as the most righteous guardians of morality: precisely those few righteous personalities would be most inclined to persecute or ostracize anyone who is in the business of exposing the &quot;noble lie&quot; which supports the authority of the few over the many. (cf. also Mosca&#x27;s &quot;political formula&quot;) Strauss thus presents Maimonides &quot;as a closet nonbeliever obfuscating his message for political reasons.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Strauss&#x27;s ideas in &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot; sparked controversy due to differing interpretations of the exoteric-esoteric dichotomy. Despite academic debate, no widely accepted interpretation of this dichotomy has emerged. Some scholars, e.g. Lampert, Frazer and Drury believe that Strauss wrote in an esoteric manner, while, others such as Batnitzky finds this idea wrong. The lack of consensus on the exoteric-esoteric dichotomy has led to conflicting interpretations of Strauss&#x27;s ideas and even his character, resulting in a dispute that can be emotionally charged. For example, some view Strauss as a fascist, while others see him as a defender of democracy.

In the essay, &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot;, Strauss posits that information needs to be kept secret from the masses by &quot;writing between the lines&quot;. However, this seems like a false premise, as most authors Strauss refers to in his work lived in times when only the social elites were literate enough to understand works of philosophy.

<text>Kaimanawa horses are a population of feral horses in New Zealand that are descended from domestic horses released in the 19th and 20th centuries. They are known for their hardiness and quiet temperament. The New Zealand government strictly controls the population to protect the habitat in which they live, which includes several endangered species of plants. The varying heritage gives the breed a wide range of heights, body patterns and colours. They are usually well-muscled, sure-footed and tough.

Horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876, although the first horses had been brought to New Zealand in 1814. The herds grew as horses escaped or were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases. Some of the horses were recaptured by the locals to be riding horses, as well as for their meat, hair, and hides. The number of horses declined as large-scale farms and forestry operations were built on the ranges, and there was only around 174 horses by 1979. The New Zealand government started protecting the Kaimanawa horses in 1981, and there were 1,576 horses by 1994. Roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size of the herd, removing around 2,800 horses altogether. All suitable horses are available for rehoming after the roundups. The Kaimanawa horse population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization, and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed.

There is also a small unmanaged population of feral horses on the Aupōuri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island.

The majority of Kaimanawa horses are small but tough and sure-footed, and they are widely popular as Pony Club mounts and showjumpers. They are also popular as stock horses for high country stations.

==History==
The first horses were introduced to New Zealand by Anglican missionary Reverend Samuel Marsden in December 1814, and wild horses were first reported in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876. The Kaimanawa breed descended from domestic horses that were released into the ranges in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Between 1858 and 1875, Major George Gwavas Carlyon imported Exmoor ponies to Hawkes Bay (not likely purebred Exmoors). They were later crossed with local horses to produce the Carlyon Pony. The Carlyon Ponies were later crossed with two Welsh Pony stallions, Kinarth Caesar and Comet, who were imported by Sir Donald McLean, and a breed known as the Comet Horse resulted. In the 1870s, McLean released a Comet stallion and several mares onto the Kaingaroa Plains and the bloodline mixed into the wild Kaimanawa Horse population. Other breeds were added to the Kaimanawa herds when riding horses escaped or were released from local sheep stations, and the cavalry units at Waiouru released horses when they were threatened with a strangles epidemic. It is also thought that in the 1960s, Nicholas Koreneff released an Arabian stallion into the Argo Valley region and the Arabian breed mixed into the Kaimanawa herds.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, horses were captured from the Kaimanawa herds and used as riding and stock horses, as well as being used for their meat, hair, and hides. Originally there were many herds that roamed the land owned by the British Crown and the native Māori, but many disappeared when large scale farms and forestry operations were built on the ranges, and also farm machinery decreased the need for stock horses. The Kaimanawa horses today have the most genetic similarity with Thoroughbred horses and Thoroughbred cross breeds.

Land development and an increasing human population reduced the number of the Kaimanawa horses and the space they had to roam, and in 1979 only around 174 horses remained. In 1981, the Kaimanawa horse population, the size of the ranges, and the herd movements began to be officially measured. A protected area was formed in the Waiouru Army Camp for the Kaimanawa herds to live. Legislative protection of the Kaimanawa horses was similar to that of the kiwi and other native species. There was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed, and 1,576 horses were living in the area by 1994.

There is also a small population of feral horses living on the Aupōuri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island. These horses live on the land owned by local Māori and are mostly unmanaged by the New Zealand government. 

The Wilson Sisters from Whangārei, New Zealand made the Kaimanawa horses a household name in New Zealand so that after the 2016 muster there were enough homes for all the suitable horses to be rehomed. Kelly Wilson has published seven bestselling books about the Kaimanawa Horses. &quot;For the Love of Horses&quot; is about their childhood and becoming New Zealand&#x27;s best showjumping riders and the first time they tamed wild Kaimanawas, &quot;Stallion Challenges&quot; is about the year they tamed wild two Kaimanawa stallions each to compete in the Stallion Challenge competition, &quot;Mustang Ride&quot; is about the sisters taming wild mustangs in America to compete in the Mustang Makeover, &quot;Saving the Snowy Brumbies&quot; is about the sisters taming wild brumby horses from Australia, &quot;Ranger the Kaimanawa Stallion&quot; is told by a Kaimanawa stallion called Ranger who was tamed by the sisters, and the &quot;Showtym Adventures&quot; series is a junior fiction series about the sisters&#x27; favorite ponies from their childhood.

Several other books have been published about the wild Kaimanawa horses. In 2008, Dianne Haworth published a novel called &quot;Kaimanawa Princess&quot; that was inspired by 13-year-old Rochelle Purcell and her pony Kaimanawa Princess who campaigned to save the wild Kaimanawa horses in 1996. In the book, a girl rehomes a wild Kaimanawa horse and her foal and tames them while fighting to stop the government culling the wild Kaimanawa horses. In 2018, Marion Day published a novel called &quot;Blue Cloud&quot; about the life of a wild horse and a girl who dreams of having her own horse and how they come together.

==Breed characteristics==
Many characteristics of the Comet Horses are shown in the Kaimanawa horses today, although the varied gene input has produced a wide range of sizes, colours, and body types among the wild horses. The Kaimanawa breed varies widely in general appearance, with heights ranging between high. Any coat colour or pattern is acceptable. Their feral way of life has given them the ability to adapt quickly and live on very little, and they are usually sure-footed and tough. They have a medium-sized head in good proportion to their body, with wide variation in shape due to the different conformation of their ancestors. Kaimanawa horses have a short deep neck with a thick throat area, straight shoulders, a deep girth, and a short to medium back. The hindquarters vary from sloping to well-rounded. The legs are long and well-muscled, with strong hooves, and hind hooves that are generally smaller than the front hooves. All horses in the Southern Hemisphere, including Kaimanawa horses, are considered to age a year on the first of August, regardless of their actual foaling date.

==Population control and study==
Owing to the increase in population after protective legislation was put into place, the Department of Conservation developed a management plan for the Kaimanawa herd in 1989 and 1990. A draft plan was made available to the public for comment in 1991, and the public made it clear that it objected to herd reduction through shooting from helicopters, and instead favoured the horses remaining alive after being removed from the herd. However, core animal welfare groups felt that shooting was the most humane option. Trial musters were conducted in 1993, 1994 and 1995, and were successful, although costly and with a limited demand for the captured horses.

In 1994, a working party was established to look at the management of the Kaimanawa herd. They aimed to decide which organization was in charge of long term management, to ensure that the treatment of horses is humane, to preserve and control the best attributes of the herds, and to eliminate the impacts of the herds on other conservation priorities. Goals included ensuring the welfare of the horses, protecting natural ecosystems and features that the Kaimanawa herd may impact and keeping the herd at a sustainable level. Ecological objectives included ensuring that Kaimanawa horse does not adversely affect endangered, rare and biogeographically significant plants; ensuring that the herd does not further degrade the ecosystems in which it lives; and preventing the herd from spreading into the Kaimanawa Forest Park and the Tongariro National Park. Herd objectives included ensuring that the public was safe from roaming horses, while still allowing and improving public access to the herd and ensuring humane treatment of the horses; reducing conflict between the herd and other ecological values and land uses; and ensuring that the herd is contained to a population that is tolerated by the ecosystems in which they live while still maintaining a minimum effective population that is in general free ranging.

The Department of Conservation has since 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of Kaimanawas to keep the herd population around a target level of 500 horses. The target was reduced to 300 horses starting in 2009. These horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes. A main reason for the strict population control is to protect the habitat in which they live. This habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered, which the Kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing. These plants include herbs, grasses, sedges, flowers and mistletoes; among these are &quot;Deschampsia caespitosa&quot; (a very rare tussock grass), &quot;Peraxilla tetrapetala&quot; (a vulnerable mistletoe) and &quot;Libertia peregrinans&quot; (a possibly locally extinct sand iris). The 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd, the largest culling since the beginning of the program, with homes found for 85% of the horses removed. Conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public, and between 1990 and 2003 the New Zealand Minister for Conservation received more public comments on the Kaimanawa horse than on any other subject. In this period, more than 1,400 requests for information and letters were received, with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997. This was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996; due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997. In 1997, around 1,069 horses were removed from the range and adopted, reducing the main herd to around 500, and reducing their range to around 25,000 ha from around 70,000. Since 1993, a total of around 2,800 horses have been removed from the range. Only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred.

The United Nations&#x27; Food and Agriculture Organization lists the Kaimanawa horses as a herd of special genetic value that can be compared with other groups of feral horses such as New Forest ponies, Assateague ponies, wild Mustangs, and with free-living zebras. Kaimanawas are of special value because of their low rate of interaction with humans. This lack of interaction may result in a herd with more wild and fewer domestic characteristics, which is of special interest to researchers. Between 1994 and 1997, students from Massey University studied a population of around 400 Kaimanawa horses to learn their habits and herd dynamics. A 2000 study found that although sometimes there are more than two stallions in Kaimanawa horse herds, only the two stallions highest in the herd hierarchy mate with the herd females. This differs from other feral horse herds, some of which have only one stallion that mates with mares, while others have several stallions that sire foals.

<doc id="715848" wikidata="Q2962239" url="?curid=715848" title="Chelsea Pensioner">
<text>A Chelsea Pensioner, or In-Pensioner, is a resident at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, an Old Soldiers&#x27; retirement home and nursing home for former members of the British Army located in Chelsea, London. The Royal Hospital Chelsea is home to 300 retired British soldiers, male and female (the latter since 2009), and is located on Royal Hospital Road. Historically, the term &quot;Chelsea Pensioner&quot; applied more widely, referring to both In-Pensioners and Out-Pensioners who live elsewhere.

==In- and Out-Pensioners==

The Royal Hospital was founded by King Charles II in 1682 as a retreat for veterans. The provision of a hostel rather than the payment of pensions was inspired by Les Invalides in Paris.

During the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the Royal Hospital was still under construction so they introduced a system for distribution of army pensions in 1689. The pension was to be made available to all former soldiers who had been injured in service, or who had served for more than 20 years.

By the time the Royal Hospital was completed, there were more pensioners than places available in the Royal Hospital. Eligible ex-soldiers who could not be housed in the Hospital were termed &quot;Out-Pensioners&quot;, receiving their pension from the Royal Hospital but living outside it. &quot;In-Pensioners&quot;, by contrast, surrender their army pension and live within the Royal Hospital. A number of veterans were incorporated into the Corps of Invalids from 1688 to 1802, receiving the equivalent of the out-pension in exchange for performing garrison duty.

In 1703 there were 51 Out-Pensioners. By 1815 this had risen to 36,757. The Royal Hospital remained responsible for distributing army pensions until 1955, following which the phrase &quot;Out-Pensioner&quot; became less common, and &quot;Chelsea Pensioner&quot; was used largely to refer to &quot;In-Pensioners&quot;.

==Conditions for admission==
To be eligible for admission as a Chelsea Pensioner a candidate must be a former soldier or non-commissioned officer of the British Army (including National Service) or a former officer of the British Army who served in the ranks or was awarded a disablement pension while serving in the ranks. They must be of pensionable age, be able to live independently on arrival at the Royal Hospital Chelsea and be free of any financial obligation to support a spouse or family.

==Life of In-Pensioners==

Applicants for the Royal Hospital Chelsea (RHC) are invited for a four-day stay during which they get a taste of what life is like for a Chelsea Pensioner. If they enjoy their stay and it is felt that they will fit in they are invited to become a Chelsea Pensioner. Upon arrival at the Royal Hospital, each In-Pensioner is measured up for their Blues (day-to-day uniform) and Scarlets (the famous uniform that they wear on parade). They are given their own room, or &quot;berth&quot; in a ward, and are allocated to a Company. Up until refurbishment works carried out in the 1950s, these rooms measured 6 × 6 feet. Work completed in 2015 has ensured that all In-Pensioner berths include en suite facilities, a writing desk, and natural light.

On entry, In-Pensioners surrender their army pension, in return receiving board, lodging, clothing and full medical care.

In-Pensioners also have their own club with a bar, lounges and restaurant; there are allotments for those who enjoy gardening and facilities for lawn bowls. If an In-Pensioner becomes unwell they are moved into the Infirmary, which is a care home with nursing and a G.P. medical centre. The Royal Hospital Burial Ground is at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey.

The Chelsea Pensioners were among the first to be included in the UK&#x27;s rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, having received their first dose on 23 December 2020.

==Admission of women==
The records at Royal Hospital show that a woman, Christian Davies, was admitted to Chelsea Hospital , and was awarded a pension for her service in the army and the wounds she received in the service of Queen Anne. She died in 1739 and was buried in the Royal Hospital Chelsea with full military honours.

From Davies&#x27; death until 2009, only male candidates were admitted. It was announced in 2007 that female ex-service personnel would be admitted on the completion of modernisation of the long wards. In March 2009 the first women in the Hospital&#x27;s 317-year history were admitted as In-Pensioners: Dorothy Hughes (aged 85) and Winifred Phillips (aged 82).

Winifred Phillips (1926–2016) trained as a nurse and joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1948 and enlisted in the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps in 1949 while serving in Egypt. For the next 22 years she served in Singapore, Cyprus and Egypt reaching the rank of Warrant Officer Class 2. She wrote two books about becoming one of the first female Chelsea Pensioners: &quot;My Journey to Becoming the First Lady Chelsea Pensioner&quot; (2010), and &quot;Mum&#x27;s Army: Love and Adventure from the NAAFI to Civvy Street&quot; (2013). She never married.

Dorothy Hughes joined the British Army in 1941, later working as part of 450 Heavy Anti Aircraft Battery in the London Division. In 1945 the Battery was deployed near Dover to defend against V-1 flying bomb attacks. She later worked with the Army Operational Research Group developing fuses in shells used against V-2 rockets and was discharged from the Army in 1946 with the rank of Sergeant.

==Clothing==

Chelsea Pensioners are entitled to come and go from the Royal Hospital as they please, and are permitted to wear civilian clothing wherever they travel. However, within the Hospital, and in the surrounding area, they are encouraged to wear a blue uniform. If they travel further from the Royal Hospital, they should wear the distinctive scarlet coats instead of the blue uniform. The scarlet coats are also worn for ceremonial occasions, accompanied by tricorne hats. At other times a peaked hat, known as a shako, is generally worn.

In uniform, the pensioners wear their medal ribbons and the insignia of the rank they reached while serving in the armed forces. They may also wear other insignia they earned during their service and this has included parachute jump wings and SAS jump wings.

==Memorials and burial sites==

Several cemeteries have memorials to and graves of Chelsea Pensioners. Burials were initially at Old Burial Ground, Royal Hospital Chelsea and then Brompton Cemetery, where the Chelsea Pensioners&#x27; Monument was erected in 1901. Since 1893, burials have taken place at Brookwood Cemetery in Surrey where the care of the graves was transferred in 1961 to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

==&quot;Men In Scarlet&quot; album==
Seven Chelsea Pensioners at the Royal Hospital Chelsea released an album on 8 November 2010 in order to raise money for the Chelsea Pensioners&#x27; Appeal. Featuring Dame Vera Lynn, Katherine Jenkins, The Soldiers and Janey Cutler, the album is full of well known wartime songs and includes their traditional march, &quot;The Old Brigade&quot;.

==Chelsea Football Club==
Nearby Chelsea Football Club has been affiliated with the Chelsea Pensioners for many years; the club&#x27;s first nickname was the &quot;Pensioners&quot; and until the 1950s the club crest featured a Chelsea pensioner. Residents of the Hospital can be seen attending Chelsea&#x27;s home games at Stamford Bridge.

When Chelsea won the Premier League title in 2005, Chelsea Pensioners formed a guard of honour as the players and management came out for the trophy presentation. This was repeated when Chelsea won the title in 2010. In tribute to the trademark scarlet coats worn by the pensioners, Chelsea&#x27;s kit for the 2010–11 season featured a red trim on the collars.

==Genealogical records==
Given that Royal Hospital Chelsea was responsible for administering pensions until the First World War, it retained copies of service records up to that time. In principle, the records were kept for all persons in receipt of a pension. For others, their records were retained for fifty years after discharge. These have been digitised, and can be viewed via various genealogy subscription sites.

===In-Pensioners===
There are admission &amp; discharge registers of in-Pensioners that have survived. They have been digitised, and can be accessed via various genealogy subscription sites.

===Out-Pensioners===
There are admission registers of out-Pensioners that have survived. Some of these had served long enough to accrue a deferred income. Others were in receipt of a pension, owing to being medically discharged from the army. They have been digitised, and can be accessed via a paywall.

<doc id="715857" wikidata="Q357951" url="?curid=715857" title="Mehran Karimi Nasseri">
<text>Mehran Karimi Nasseri (, ; 1945 – 12 November 2022), also known as Sir, Alfred Mehran, was an Iranian refugee who lived in the departure lounge of Terminal 1 in Charles de Gaulle Airport from 26 August 1988 until July 2006, when he was hospitalized. His autobiography was published as a book, &quot;The Terminal Man&quot;, in 2004. Nasseri&#x27;s story inspired the 1993 film &quot;Lost in Transit&quot; and the 2004 film &quot;The Terminal&quot;. He returned to living at the airport in September 2022, and died there of a heart attack in November 2022.

==Early life==
Nasseri was born in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company settlement located in Masjed Soleiman, Iran. His father, Abdelkarim, was an Iranian doctor working for the company which allowed Nasseri to grow up relatively affluently. Nasseri has claimed that he was the result of an illegitimate affair, and that his mother was a nurse from Scotland working in the same place but has also claimed a Swedish mother. However, these claims were never substantiated, and it is most likely that Nasseri&#x27;s mother was an Iranian homemaker. Aged 28, he arrived in the United Kingdom in September 1973, to take a three-year course in Yugoslav studies at the University of Bradford.

== Life in Terminal 1 ==

Nasseri alleged that he was expelled from Iran in 1977 for protests against the Shah and after a long battle, involving applications in several countries, was awarded refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Belgium. This allegedly permitted residence in many other European countries. However, this claim was disputed, with investigations showing that Nasseri was never expelled from Iran.

He was able to travel between the United Kingdom and France, but in 1988, his papers were lost when his briefcase was allegedly stolen. Others indicate that Nasseri actually mailed his documents to Brussels while on board a ferry to Britain, lying about them being stolen. Arriving in London, he was returned to France when he failed to present a passport to British immigration officials. At the French airport, he was unable to prove his identity or refugee status and was detained in the waiting area for travelers without papers.

Nasseri&#x27;s case was later taken on by French human rights lawyer Christian Bourget.
Attempts were then made to have new documents issued from Belgium, but the authorities there would do so only if Nasseri presented himself in person. In 1995, the Belgian authorities granted permission for him to travel to Belgium, but only if he agreed to live there under the supervision of a social worker. Nasseri refused this on the grounds of wanting to enter the UK as originally intended.
Both France and Belgium offered Nasseri residency, but he refused to sign the papers as they listed him as being Iranian (rather than British) and did not show his preferred name, Alfred Mehran&quot; (including the misplaced comma). His refusal to sign the documents was much to the frustration of his lawyer, Bourget. When contacted about Nasseri&#x27;s situation, his family stated that they believed he was living the life he wanted.

As for what Nasseri did day-to-day during his long stay at Terminal 1 in the Charles de Gaulle Airport, he could be found, day or night, around the Paris Bye Bye bar, where he wrote in his journal, listened to the radio, and smoked his gold pipe, or ate a meal at McDonald&#x27;s. The meals were bought for him by strangers, and he sometimes sat on a red bench in the Terminal&#x27;s first level in a reflective trance. In other accounts, his luggage was always by his side, as he wrote in his diary or studied economics.

In 2003, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks production company paid a rumoured US$275,000 to Nasseri for the rights to his story, but ultimately did not use his story in the film &quot;The Terminal&quot;.

Nasseri&#x27;s 18-year stay at the airport ended in July 2006 when he was hospitalized and his sitting place was dismantled. Towards the end of January 2007, he left the hospital and was looked after by the airport&#x27;s branch of the French Red Cross; he was lodged for a few weeks in a hotel close to the airport. On 6 March 2007, he was transferred to an Emmaus charity reception centre in Paris&#x27;s 20th arrondissement. From 2008 onwards, he lived in a Paris shelter, though in the wake of Nasseri&#x27;s death in 2022, the Associated Press reported that he had recently returned to live at the airport.

== Autobiography ==
In 2004, Nasseri&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Terminal Man&quot;, was published. It was co-written by Nasseri with British author Andrew Donkin and was reviewed in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as being &quot;profoundly disturbing and brilliant&quot;.

== Documentaries and fictionalizations ==
Nasseri&#x27;s story provided the inspiration for the 1993 French film &quot;Lost in Transit&quot;, starring Jean Rochefort. The short story &quot;The Fifteen-Year Layover&quot;, written by Michael Paterniti and published in &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;The Best American Non-Required Reading&quot;, chronicles Nasseri&#x27;s life. Alexis Kouros made a documentary about him, &quot;Waiting for Godot at De Gaulle&quot; (2000).

===&quot;Flight&quot;===
Nasseri&#x27;s story was the inspiration for the contemporary opera &quot;Flight&quot; by British composer Jonathan Dove, which was premiered at the Glyndebourne Opera House in 1998. &quot;Flight&quot; would go on to win the Helpmann Awards at the Adelaide Festival Theatre in March 2006.

===&quot;Sir Alfred of Charles De Gaulle Airport&quot;===
Glen Luchford and Paul Berczeller made the &quot;Here to Where&quot; mockumentary (2001), also featuring Nasseri. Hamid Rahmanian and Melissa Hibbard made a documentary called &quot;Sir Alfred of Charles De Gaulle Airport&quot; (2001).

===&quot;The Terminal&quot;===
Nasseri was reportedly the inspiration behind the character Viktor Navorski, played by Tom Hanks, from Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Terminal&quot;. However, neither the film&#x27;s publicity materials, nor the DVD &quot;special features&quot; nor the film&#x27;s website mentions Nasseri&#x27;s situation as an inspiration for the film. Despite this, in September 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Spielberg had bought the rights to Nasseri&#x27;s life story as the basis for &quot;The Terminal&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; indicated that Spielberg&#x27;s DreamWorks production company paid US$250,000 to Nasseri for rights to his story and reported that, as of 2004, he carried a poster advertising Spielberg&#x27;s film draping his suitcase next to his bench. Nasseri was reportedly excited about &quot;The Terminal&quot;, but it was unlikely that he would ever have had a chance to see it in cinemas.

==Death==
Nasseri died of a heart attack on 12 November 2022, at Charles de Gaulle Airport. An airport spokesperson said that Nasseri was homeless and had returned to live in a public area in the airport in September 2022.

<text>The extrastriate cortex is the region of the occipital cortex of the mammalian brain located next to the primary visual cortex. Primary visual cortex (V1) is also named striate cortex because of its striped appearance in the microscope. The extrastriate cortex encompasses multiple functional areas, including V3, V4, V5/MT, which is sensitive to motion, or the extrastriate body area (EBA) used in the perception of human bodies.

==Anatomy==
In terms of Brodmann areas, the extrastriate cortex comprises Brodmann area 18 and Brodmann area 19, while the striate cortex comprises Brodmann area 17.

In primates, the extrastriate cortex includes visual area V3, visual area V4, and visual area MT (sometimes called V5), while V1 corresponds to the striate cortex, and V2 to the prestriate cortex.
