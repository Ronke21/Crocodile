<text>Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose (rebranded simply as Parker Lewis for the third and final season) is an American teen sitcom that originally aired on Fox from September 1990 to June 1993. It was produced by Clyde Phillips Productions, in association with Columbia Pictures Television. The series depicts the tribulations of the title character Parker Lewis (played by Corin Nemec), a Santo Domingo High School student, for whom nothing is impossible. It was strongly influenced by the feature film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

==Premise==
&quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot; features the titular character as frequent narrator of episodes. Alongside Parker, Jerry Steiner and Mikey Randall are main characters whose primary focus through the show is fitting in. The show revolves around the experiences of these characters as they navigate the challenges of adolescence and strive for social acceptance within their high school. Their efforts are often thwarted by Parker&#x27;s little sister, Shelly, and school principal Grace Musso.

The series focuses on the teenage lives of its characters and has a cartoon-like quality, though it is live action. Many episodes contain references to pop culture, politics and celebrities. The surrealism was toned down in the series&#x27; final season, going as far as having Parker acknowledge this by breaking the fourth wall and &#x27;canceling&#x27; one of the show&#x27;s transitions.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main===

* Parker Lloyd Lewis (played by Corin Nemec) – Parker Lewis is very popular at school. A smart guy with a penchant for garish shirts and cutting classes, Parker usually has a plan up his sleeve, and in turn, it usually involves outsmarting someone else. Plans put into effect begin with the command: &quot;Synchronize Watches.&quot; He and his two best friends have their high-tech headquarters hidden above the gym. In the final season, Parker finally settles down with one girl, Annie, and appears more mature and less reliant on his former attitude.
* Michael Patrick &quot;Mikey&quot; Randall (played by Billy Jayne) – A rock and roll rebel without a cause and by far the most emotionally driven of the trio, he often quotes or paraphrases famous songs (for example, &quot;To quote Don Henley, this is &#x27;The End of the Innocence&#x27;&quot; (episode two), or suggesting to &quot;Paint It, Black&quot; when Jerry betrays the group&#x27;s trust). Mikey at one point considered dropping out of Santo Domingo HS when a prank by Shelly caused him to unknowingly play a love song, which he had composed for a girl he had feelings for, for the entire school.
* Jerry Steiner (played by Troy Slaten) – A stereotypical nerd. In the first two seasons, he wears a trench coat (said to be made by NASA) from which he produces a wide variety of objects, which are apparently held inside the coat with Velcro. He addresses everyone formally by last name, e.g., &quot;Mr. Lewis&quot;, &quot;Mr. Randall&quot;, and even &quot;Mr. Kubiac&quot;, or collectively as &quot;sirs&quot;. At the end of the credits of the pilot episode, Jerry hid in the locker next to Parker&#x27;s, talking endlessly to Parker through the door, not knowing that he had left, causing him to plaintively call out: &quot;Mr. Lewis? Mr. Randall? Mr. Phillips? (Clyde Phillips, the series&#x27; creator and executive producer) Hello?&quot; One notable episode dealt with Parker and Mikey confiscating Jerry&#x27;s trench coat in help him get to meet a potential girlfriend.
* Grace Musso (played by Melanie Chartoff) – Principal of Santo Domingo High, she is Parker&#x27;s arch-; at , she is said to be in her mid-thirties, but is actually older. She wants to get Parker expelled. She often breaks the glass on her office door when she makes her distinctive &quot;thumb swoosh&quot; gesture. She has a racy side which is sometimes exposed; her turn-ons include beards and large hands. She was portrayed as a spinster at first, but seemed to have a skill in men, one time having dated an officer of each of the armed forces. She has many secrets which she would rather be kept quiet, such as living in a $600,000 house on a $38,000 a year salary (episode six), which Parker uses as the necessity arises. Parker&#x27;s blackmail ideas sometimes backfired on him; one of his actions resulted in Musso&#x27;s suspension. When a tougher headmaster is brought in to replace her, Parker must find out a way to get her back now that it is gone &quot;from bad to worse&quot;.
* Shelly Ann Lewis (played by Maia Brewton) – Parker&#x27;s other nemesis, she is his little sister, who attends the same school as a freshman. She likes to manipulate teachers and parents to her benefit and tries to get Parker into trouble. Shelly also teams up with Musso if she sees a chance to ruin Parker. She is on friendly terms with Jerry and the two seem to end up in a constant relationship at the end of the series. Her favorite saying is: &quot;My brother is a dead man!&quot; whenever she finds an opportunity to bring Parker into an embarrassing situation. She has a tendency to call out &quot;Mom!&quot; when Parker gets one over on her, as seen at the start or end of various programs.
* Martin Lloyd &quot;Marty&quot; Lewis (played by Timothy Stack) – Parker and Shelly&#x27;s father, he owns a video rental store called Mondo Video with his wife, and is helped by Parker and Shelly on weekends. He tries hard to keep some of the coolness that he had in his own school days when he was a self-described &quot;young hoodlum&quot;. It is shown that he graduated from Santo Domingo High School and had two friends who were similar to Jerry and Mikey. Marty has also played mean pranks on Principal Musso, who had been a classmate of his at Santo Domingo, hence explaining Musso&#x27;s resentment of Parker. The role of Mr. Lewis was played by Sherman Howard in the pilot episode.
* Judy Lewis (played by Anne Bloom in season one and Mary Ellen Trainor in the pilot episode and seasons two and three) – Parker and Shelly&#x27;s mother, she can be loving and gentle, but if her family is threatened, she is ready for battle.
* Francis Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Kubiac III (played by Abraham Benrubi) – Known as &quot;Kube&quot;, at tall and in weight, he is built like a dinosaur with a brain to match, yet with a surprisingly sweet disposition. While walking, Kubiac causes earth tremors. His favorite line is, &quot;Eat now?&quot; In the series&#x27; beginning, he was introduced as a pure bully, aggressive and hostile towards other characters, but within a few episodes, his character changed into a more benign and friendly &quot;gentle giant&quot;, and he quickly became a helpful character who would often assist Parker and his friends in their schemes. It is later revealed to Parker that Larry is more intelligent than he appears, and his dim-witted persona is merely an act. 
* Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Lemmer (played by Taj Johnson) – Principal Musso&#x27;s ultra-conservative sidekick and &quot;lapdog&quot; with vampiric tendencies, he has been in school 16 years (episode nine), wears black, and seems to have a telepathic connection to the principal and is obsessed with war, strategy, and politics. Musso can summon him with a dog whistle. He is able to teleport at will. Despite him largely being an adversary to Parker, at one time Parker actually agreed to help Frank Lemmer win over a girl named Denise (Andrea Elson), who turns out to be a blood relative of Grace Musso&#x27;s. He was absent without explanation in the show&#x27;s final season.
* Annie Faith Sloan (played by Jennifer Guthrie) – She is Parker&#x27;s love interest from the middle of the second season to the show&#x27;s end. When Parker&#x27;s parents were out of town one weekend, he invited Annie to his house with the intent to go all the way, only for Kubiac, Mikey, Jerry and others to show up to his house unannounced all at once and ruining his plans, but ultimately grateful when he learns Annie values abstinence.

===Recurring===
* Dr. Norman Pankow (played by Gerrit Graham in seasons one and two) – The principal of rival El Corrado High School with a doctorate in penology, he is Musso&#x27;s primary adult rival and a devotee of the sculpting of bonsai trees. As tough as Musso is, Pankow is regarded as much worse. One of Parker&#x27;s stunts had caused Musso&#x27;s suspension; when Dr. Pankow replaced her, Parker admits he got more than he bargained for and needed to bring about Musso&#x27;s reinstatement.
* Nick Comstock (played by Paul Johansson) – Manager of the Atlas Diner during the second season, he is very attractive and possesses a supernatural ability to help people with their problems, often dishing out sage advice to Parker.
* Bradley &#x27;Brad&#x27; Penny (played by Harold Pruett) – He appeared in the show&#x27;s final season. He works as a bricklayer, and is athletic and good-looking. Parker sees him as a nemesis, but Brad often only wants to be friends, though misunderstandings come between them. Shelly is intrigued by him.
* Coach Hank Kohler (played by John Pinette). Joining during the show&#x27;s final season, Hank Kohler served as a father figure for Larry Kubiac and the new owner of the Atlas Diner, which he eventually loses in the show&#x27;s final episode, &quot;The Last Supper&quot;. He is obsessed with Grace Musso, who is completely repulsed by him.

<text>Stanley William Turrentine (April 5, 1934 – September 12, 2000) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist and record producer. He began his career playing R&amp;B for Earl Bostic and later soul jazz recording for the Blue Note label from 1960, touching on jazz fusion during a stint on CTI in the 1970s. He was described by critic Steve Huey as &quot;renowned for his distinctively thick, rippling tone [and] earthy grounding in the blues.&quot; In the 1960s Turrentine was married to organist Shirley Scott, with whom he frequently recorded, and he was the younger brother of trumpeter Tommy Turrentine, with whom he also recorded.
==Biography==
Turrentine was born in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District, Pennsylvania, and was raised at 908 Bryn Mawr Road Pittsburgh PA 15219 on the 3rd floor Apartment. United States, into a musical family. His father, Thomas Turrentine Sr., was a saxophonist with Al Cooper&#x27;s Savoy Sultans, his mother played stride piano, and his older brother Tommy Turrentine was a trumpet player.

He began his prolific career with blues and rhythm and blues bands, and was at first greatly influenced by Illinois Jacquet. He first toured with Lowell Fulson&#x27;s band in 1951, at 17, and in 1953 Earl Bostic asked him to join his band, replacing John Coltrane. He also played in groups led by the pianist and composer Tadd Dameron.

Turrentine received his only formal musical training during his military stint in the mid-1950s. In 1959, he left the military and went straight into the band of the drummer Max Roach.

He married the organist Shirley Scott in 1960 and the two frequently played and recorded together. In the 1960s, he started working with organist Jimmy Smith, and made many soul jazz recordings both with Smith and as a leader. Scott and Turrentine divorced in 1971.

Turrentine turned to jazz fusion and signed for Creed Taylor&#x27;s CTI label. His first album for CTI, &quot;Sugar&quot;, recorded in 1970, proved one of his biggest successes and a seminal recording for the label, closely followed by &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Mister T.&quot; (1971). He worked with Freddie Hubbard, Milt Jackson, George Benson, Bob James, Richard Tee, Idris Muhammad, Ron Carter, Grant Green and Eric Gale. He returned to soul jazz in the 1980s and into the 1990s.

Turrentine lived in Fort Washington, Maryland, from the early 1990s until his death.

He died of a stroke in New York City on September 12, 2000, aged 66, and was buried in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Allegheny Cemetery.

<doc id="717485" wikidata="Q464533" url="?curid=717485" title="Li Tie">
<text>Li Tie (; born 18 May 1977) is a Chinese former professional football coach and player.

A defensive midfielder, he represented Liaoning in the Chinese Jia-A League, Everton in the Premier League, Sheffield United in the Football League Championship and Chengdu Blades in the Chinese Super League. At international level, he made 92 appearances scoring six goals for the China national team. He was chosen for the AFC Asian Cup in 2000 and 2007, and for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

After retirement from playing, he started his coaching career as an assistant coach at Guangzhou Evergrande. He moved to the China national team and then Hebei China Fortune where he gained his first coaching position. In 2024, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for bribery.

==Club career==
===Liaoning FC===
Li Tie began his football career at the age of fifteen, joining Liaoning&#x27;s youth academy system in 1992. The following year, he was sent to Brazil for a five-year training programme sponsored by Jianlibao and became the captain of the newly organized youth football team. Li started his professional career by playing for Liaoning and rose to prominence during the 1999 league season when Liaoning finished as runners-up within the league.

===Everton===
One of the highest regarded Chinese players of his generation, Li secured a loan transfer in a deal brokered between sponsor Kejian and Premier League side Everton in August 2002. Despite initial skepticism at Merseyside, his first season as an Everton player was a surprising success. Then manager David Moyes played him in twenty-nine league games and started him in most of his appearances where his displays, as a defensive midfielder helped the club achieve a seventh-place finish during the 2002-03 season.

Following Li&#x27;s successful loan spell, Everton battled with his former club Liaoning to sign him on a permanent basis after the 2002-03 season and the deal was finally negotiated on 12 August 2003 when Li signed a three-year contract. Everton paid £1,200,000 for his transfer with two-thirds of the deal paid by sponsorships. The club&#x27;s ownership let him move to the Premier League despite higher offers from Chinese clubs. At the beginning of the 2003-04 season, Li&#x27;s start was marred by a sending off against Arsenal on 16 August 2003 after only been substituted on for David Unsworth. A series of injuries followed which meant that Li only played five league matches that season. The last injury, a broken leg picked up during international duty in February 2004, ruled him out for another twelve months. In January 2005, when Li made his return to the pitch by playing for Everton&#x27;s reserve side against Bolton Wanderers, he lasted just forty-one minutes and required his leg to be reassessed.

In the summer of 2005, eighteen months since his last game for the Everton first team, Li played the full match against FC Gamlitz in a pre-season friendly. He made a number of other preseason appearances and looked as if he was finally coming back to full fitness. However, he never managed to break back into the first team despite playing regularly for the reserves and even earning another international call-up for the Chinese national team. In March 2006, Li underwent another operation to remove pieces of bone that had grown on his ankle during his time on the sidelines.

===Sheffield United===
In May 2006, Li was released by Everton and Sheffield United announced his signing on a free transfer in July 2006, agreeing to a two-year contract. Following his move, Li spent some time training with China League One side Chengdu Blades, which was owned by Sheffield United, while waiting for his visa clearance. On 19 September 2006, Li made his first competitive club start since January 2004 by appearing for Sheffield United in a League Cup match against Bury. However, Li did not make another appearance for Sheffield United afterwards due to his lingering injury.

On 12 October 2007, Li was told he could leave Sheffield United on a free transfer, with then manager Bryan Robson saying: &quot;He&#x27;s not in my plans and he is free to go wherever he wants on a free transfer.&quot; Only two days later though, Sheffield United changed their mind on the decision and stated that he would stay at the club until the end of the season before having his future evaluated.

===Back to China===
Despite reassurances to the contrary, Li did indeed move in 2008, transferring to Sheffield United&#x27;s affiliated club Chengdu Blades to reinforce the team after their promotion to the Chinese Super League and made his debut in the opening game of the 2008 season against his former club Liaoning Whowin. He scored first league goal in his football career in a 3-1 win against Shenzhen Shangqingyin in October 2008.

After spending one season with Chengdu, Li decided to return to his hometown club Liaoning Whowin to help them in their promotion push back to the top tier. It proved to be an immediate success when he guided them to the securing the second tier league title and being promoted back to the top flight after only one season. He suffered an injury in October 2010 which ruled him out for the whole 2011 season. After not fully recovering from his leg injury, Li announced that he had decided to retire from football at the end of the 2011 season.

==International career==
Li was one of four players called up from the Shenzhen Youth for the final round of 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers by Qi Wusheng, along with Li Jinyu, Sui Dongliang, and Zhang Xiaorui. He was chosen for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the nation&#x27;s debut in the tournament.

Recovering from an injury, Li returned to competitive football in June 2006 with substitute appearances for the China national team against Switzerland and France. He was once again called up to play for the national team in a friendly against Thailand on 10 August 2006 and in a 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Singapore on 16 August 2006. Li remained as a part of the national side and was called up by Zhu Guanghu to play the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, but failed to make an appearance during the tournament.

==Managerial career==
On 25 May 2012, Li accepted an invitation from Guangzhou Evergrande manager Marcello Lippi to become one of his assistant coaches. He also became the assistant coach of the Chinese national team under Alain Perrin in May 2014. He resigned from his position as assistant coach on 26 June 2015 after about three seasons with Guangzhou.

Li became the deputy general manager, sports director and assistant coach at China League One side Hebei China Fortune on 14 July 2015. On 18 August 2015, he was assigned as the manager of the club after Radomir Antić&#x27;s departure. Li led the club to win promotion to Chinese Super League in the 2015 season by winning eight matches in the rest of nine and finishing the runners-up in the league. On 27 August 2016, Li was replaced by Manuel Pellegrini after winning just one match in the last nine matches.

On 16 November 2017, Li was appointed as the head coach of China League One club Wuhan Zall. In the 2018 season, he led the club to the Chinese Super after a five-year absence, being confirmed as champions and achieving promotion with three matches remaining in the season.

He acted as caretaker coach of Chinese national team following the resignation of Marcello Lippi in 2019. On 2 January 2020, Li was appointed as the new manager of China. On 3 December 2021, Li was replaced by fellow 2002 World Cup teammate Li Xiaopeng.

==Corruption conviction==
On 26 November 2022, Li was placed under investigation for &quot;serious violations of laws&quot; by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party&#x27;s internal disciplinary body, and the National Supervisory Commission, the highest anti-corruption agency of China.

On 23 February 2024, it was reported that Li was under trial for &quot;accepting and offering bribes&quot; while manager of the Chinese national team and for being involved in match-fixing while manager of Hebei China Fortune and Wuhan Zall; he had confessed to this act.

On 13 December 2024 it was reported that Li was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the above crime, having been declared guilty.

<text>Denise Alexander is an American actress (born November 11, 1939), best known for her role as Lesley Webber on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, a role she originally played from 1973 to 1984 (contract), 1996 to 2009, and a guest stint in 2013, in honor of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Alexander returned to General Hospital for two other guest appearances in December 2017 and April 2019, the latter to commemorate the 56th anniversary of the show. She then reappeared in early 2021.

==Life and career==

Alexander was born in New York City on November 11, 1939, and raised on Long Island. She moved to Los Angeles when her father, Alec Alexander, an agent who handled such notables as Frank Gorshin and Sal Mineo, decided to make the switch from the East to the West Coast. Alexander had appeared on TV and radio by the time she was a junior at UCLA. She made her feature movie debut at age fourteen in the Don Siegel film &quot;Crime in the Streets&quot; starring John Cassavetes. In 1962 Alexander appeared as Mildred Kroeger on the first season of the TV western &quot;The Virginian&quot; on the episode titled &quot;Impasse.&quot;
Alexander first broke into the soap opera genre by playing Lois Adams on &quot;The Clear Horizon&quot; in 1960. Her big break on soaps came via the role of Susan Hunter Martin on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1966 to 1973. In 1973, the character of Susan was written out of the show temporarily during contract negotiations with Alexander. ABC Daytime rushed to offer her a then-unheard of salary/perks package to join &quot;General Hospital&quot;. When Susan finally returned to &quot;Days&quot;, a new actress, Bennye Gatteys, played her.

Alexander&#x27;s role on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Dr. Lesley Williams, became a long-running role. She stayed with the show for eleven years as one of the show&#x27;s most popular leading ladies, leaving in 1984 after a contract dispute. In 1986, she was offered a big salary to portray McKinnon matriarch, Mary, on &quot;Another World&quot;. When the commute from her home in Los Angeles to &quot;Another World&quot;&#x27;s studio in New York City proved to be difficult for her, she left the show, filming her last scene in 1989, but briefly returned for a guest appearance in 1991. In 1996, she returned to the role of Lesley (brought back from the dead after almost 13 years) on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, which she continued playing on a recurring basis until 2009 when the character simply faded from view. She reprised the role in time for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2013 and remained on canvas as a recurring character throughout that year. Alexander reprised her role on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in late December 2017 for a short stint, and also for one episode in April 2019 for the show&#x27;s 56th anniversary. She also reprised the role in early 2021.

==Filmography==

In November 1949, Alexander played Perry Como&#x27;s daughter on &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; on NBC. It was a Thanksgiving-themed show with guest Raymond Massey portraying Abraham Lincoln.

<doc id="717496" wikidata="Q795536" url="?curid=717496" title="BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition">
<text>BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition (known as Cardiff Singer of the World from 1983 to 2001 and BBC Singer of the World in Cardiff in 2003) is a competition for classical singers held every two years.

The competition was started by BBC Wales in 1983 to celebrate the opening of St David&#x27;s Hall in Cardiff, Wales, home of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. The creation of the competition was overseen by Geraint Stanley Jones, who was the controller at BBC Wales at the time.
Auditions are held throughout the world in the autumn before the competition, with singers being selected to take part in Cardiff the following June. Each singer represents their own country. In Wales there is a competition to select the national representative; the winner of the Welsh Singers Showcase represents Wales in BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition.

The competition is judged by a panel of distinguished singers, musicians and music professionals. In 2003 an audience prize was also introduced for the primary competition; in 2011 it was renamed the Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize to mark the passing of the singer who was the competition&#x27;s first patron.

==History==
In 1983, the first year of the competition, eighteen singers participated. The winner was Finnish soprano Karita Mattila.

A Lieder Prize was introduced in 1989, as art song and opera are both important forms of singing, but very different. The 1989 competition was particularly noteworthy with Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel winning the Lieder prize and Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky taking the overall title. Both singers went on to enjoy successful careers with international acclaim.

The &quot;Song Prize&quot; (formerly the &quot;Lieder Prize&quot;) was renamed in 2001 in order to clarify that it applies to art song and folksong rather than German Lieder only. The &quot;Song Prize&quot; became a separate event in 2003, named as the &quot;BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Rosenblatt Recital Song Prize&quot;. However, after the 2009 competition, its name was changed to &quot;BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Song Prize&quot;. It is not compulsory, and the only entry requirement is that the singer is taking part in the primary competition. It is not possible to enter for the &quot;Song Prize&quot; only. In 2001, Romanian tenor Marius Brenciu became the first singer to win both prizes.

Finnish baritone Tommi Hakala won in 2003, with the Song Prize going to Irish soprano Ailish Tynan. The first &quot;Audience Prize&quot;, voted for by the audience both in the hall and for the broadcasts, was awarded to Chilean soprano Angela Marambio.

The 2005 prize was won by American soprano Nicole Cabell, with English tenor Andrew Kennedy winning the &quot;Song Prize&quot; and the &quot;Audience Prize&quot; being won by Korean soprano Ha-Joung Lee.

Chinese singer Shen Yang (subsequently known as Shenyang) won the 2007 competition, The &quot;Song Prize&quot; was won by English soprano Elizabeth Watts, while Jacques Imbrailo, South African baritone, won the &quot;Audience Prize&quot;.

In 2009, the winner was Russian soprano Ekaterina Scherbachenko. The winner of the &quot;Song Prize&quot; was bass Jan Martinik from the Czech Republic and Italian tenor Giordano Luca took the &quot;Audience Prize&quot;.
Followed a revised format and schedule, the 2011 competition had 20 singers taking part in four preliminary concerts. The 2011 winner was Moldovan soprano Valentina Naforniță, who also won the newly renamed &quot;Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize&quot;. The &quot;Song Prize&quot; was won by Ukrainian baritone Andrei Bondarenko.

The 30th anniversary competition took place between 16 and 23 June 2013. It was won by US mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton, who also won the &quot;Song Prize&quot;. The &quot;Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize&quot; was won by English tenor Ben Johnson.

Many non-winning finalists have gone on to very distinguished operatic careers. Examples include Finnish soprano Soile Isokoski in 1987, Swedish dramatic soprano Nina Stemme in 1993 and Latvian mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca in 2001.

The 2025 edition of the competition has been postponed until 2027 due to the host venue, St David&#x27;s Hall, being closed to allow for essential work to be carried out to replace the roof. The competition will instead stage a televised gala concert, featuring previous winners and competitors, in October 2025 as part of the Wales Millennium Centre&#x27;s Llais international music festival.

==Organisation==
The competition is organised by BBC Cymru Wales and was televised nationwide by BBC Two until 2013 and on BBC Four since 2003 (BBC Knowledge in 2001). Additionally, the competition is televised by BBC Two Wales, in Welsh on S4C and broadcast over radio channels BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio Wales and the Welsh language BBC Radio Cymru. All coverage can also be found on BBC iPlayer. It is supported by Welsh National Opera and the Cardiff Council.

From 2003, the competition&#x27;s first patron was Dame Joan Sutherland, until her death in 2010. Since 2011, the patron has been Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.

<text>The flag of the Arab League comprises a green banner bearing the seal of the Arab League. The twenty-two links in the chain represent the twenty-two members of the League at the time of the flag&#x27;s adoption. The script gives the name of the organization: &quot;League of Arab States&quot;.

There are also several flags for the Arab League, usually seen at Arab League summits: one, a color-inverted Arab League flag with a white background for the President of the summit was clearly seen in the Arab League Summit in Beirut in 2002.

Older Arab League flags have the chains in red or black, the Arabic script in black or gold with green or white crescents, usually adopted in the 1950s to the 1970s.

== History ==
The flag was adopted on March 8, 1945 as the organization&#x27;s national flag. The creator of the flag is unknown. The flag serves as an official flag for Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen.

== Description ==
The flag contains a modified version of the Emblem of the Arab League portrayed in the center of the flag on a green background. The twenty-two chain links of the emblem represents the twenty-two countries members of The league.

<text>Built-in inflation is a type of inflation that results from past events and persists in the present.

Built-in inflation is one of three major determinants of the current inflation rate. In Robert J. Gordon&#x27;s triangle model of inflation, the current inflation rate equals the sum of demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. &quot;Demand-pull inflation&quot; refers to the effects of falling unemployment rates (rising real gross domestic product) in the Phillips curve model, while the other two factors lead to &quot;shifts&quot; in the Phillips curve.

The built-in inflation originates from either persistent demand-pull or large cost-push (supply-shock) inflation in the past. It then becomes a &quot;normal&quot; aspect of the economy, via inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral.

*Inflationary expectations play a role because if workers and employers expect inflation to persist in the future, they will increase their (nominal) wages and prices now. (See real vs. nominal in economics.) This means that inflation happens now simply because of subjective views about what may happen in the future. Following the generally accepted theory of adaptive expectations, such inflationary expectations arise because of persistent past experience with inflation.
*The price/wage spiral is the adversarial nature of bargaining about wages in modern capitalism. It is part of the conflict theory of inflation. Workers and employers usually do not get together to agree on the value of real wages. Instead, workers attempt to protect their real wages from falling in response to inflation (or to attain a target real wage) by pushing for higher money (nominal) wages. Thus, if they expect price inflation – or have experienced price inflation in the past – they push for higher nominal wages. If they are successful, this raises the costs faced by their employers. To protect the real value of their profits (or to attain a target profit rate or rate of return on investment), employers then pass the higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This encourages workers to push for higher nominal wages because these price rises raise their cost of living; so the inflationary cycle reinforces itself.

In the end, built-in inflation involves a vicious circle of both subjective and objective elements, so that inflation encourages inflation to persist. It means that the standard methods of fighting inflation using monetary policy or fiscal policy to induce a recession are extremely expensive, i.e. they can cause large rises in unemployment and large falls in real gross domestic product. This suggests that alternative methods such as wage and price controls (incomes policies) may also be needed in the fight against inflation.

<text>The BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBC NOW) () is a Welsh symphony orchestra and one of the BBC&#x27;s five professional radio orchestras. The BBC NOW is the only professional symphony orchestra organisation in Wales, occupying a dual role as both a broadcasting orchestra and national orchestra. The BBC NOW has its administrative base in Cardiff, at the BBC Hoddinott Hall on the site of the Wales Millennium Centre, since January 2009.

The BBC NOW is the orchestra-in-residence at St David&#x27;s Hall, Cardiff, and also performs regularly throughout Wales and beyond, including international tours and annual appearances at the Royal Albert Hall in London at the BBC Proms. Broadcasting work includes studio sessions for BBC Radio and television, although the orchestra&#x27;s concerts form the bulk of its broadcasts, transmitted primarily on BBC Radio 3 but also on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Television. The orchestra records many soundtracks for BBC television, including &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, &quot;Human Planet&quot;, and &quot;Earthflight&quot;.

==History==
The precursor ensemble of the BBC NOW was the Cardiff Station Orchestra, which was founded in 1924 and had developed into the National Orchestra of Wales by 1928. Funding problems resulted in the disbandment of this orchestra in 1931. In 1935, the BBC Welsh Orchestra was established as a 20-member ensemble, but the orchestra was dissolved with the advent of the Second World War in 1939. After the war, the BBC Welsh Orchestra was revived as a 31-member ensemble, with Mansel Thomas as its first principal conductor. In 1947, the BBC Welsh Chorus was founded as the affiliate chorus of the orchestra. The orchestra&#x27;s ensemble size increased steadily, reaching 44 musicians in the 1960–1961 season, 60 musicians in 1974, and 66 musicians in 1976, when the orchestra&#x27;s name was changed to the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra. It reached a full symphonic complement of 88 players in 1987 before being reduced to its current level of 78 players in 2014 as part of BBC savings delivered by Director at the time, Michael Garvey, who also made reductions to the administrative and management team through redundancies. In the 1970s, a new chorus to supplant the former BBC Welsh Chorus, the BBC Welsh Choral Society, was established. In 1993, the orchestra was renamed the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, to reflect more suitably its special role as both a national orchestra and a BBC Performing Group. In parallel, the chorus was renamed the BBC National Chorus of Wales. Both the orchestra and the chorus engage in outreach work through their Education and Community Outreach department, which creates access to the players and singers for Welsh schools, groups, communities and musicians of all abilities.

Tadaaki Otaka, principal conductor from 1987 to 1995, is currently the BBC NOW&#x27;s conductor laureate. Richard Hickox, principal conductor from 2000 to 2006, was the orchestra&#x27;s conductor emeritus until his death in November 2008. In July 2011, the BBC NOW announced the appointment of Thomas Søndergård as its 14th principal conductor, effective with the 2012–2013 season, for an initial contract of 4 years. In February 2016, the BBC NOW announced the further extension of Søndergård&#x27;s contract as principal conductor through &quot;at least 2018&quot;. Søndergård formally concluded his tenure as principal conductor in July 2018.

Past principal guest conductors have included Mariss Jansons, James Loughran and Jac van Steen. François-Xavier Roth was the past associate guest conductor of the BBC NOW. In December 2015, the BBC NOW announced the appointment of Xian Zhang as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2016–2017 season, with an initial contract of 3 years. She is the first female conductor named to a titled post with any BBC orchestra. Past Composers-in-Association have included B Tommy Andersson. Huw Watkins became the BBC NOW&#x27;s Composer-in-Association, beginning in 2015. In September 2020, Gavin Higgins was announced as the BBC NOW&#x27;s new composer-in-association. Adrian Partington is the current artistic director of the BBC National Chorus of Wales.

In November 2018, Ryan Bancroft first guest-conducted the BBC NOW, as an emergency substitute for Xian Zhang. He returned as guest conductor to the BBC NOW in May 2019. In September 2019, the BBC NOW announced the appointment of Bancroft as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2020–2021 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.

Previous Directors of the BBC NOW and the BBC National Chorus of Wales have included Huw Tregelles-Williams, David Murray (responsible for the building of Hoddinott Hall) and Michael Garvey. In September 2019, the BBC announced the appointment of Lisa Tregale as the new Director of the BBC NOW and the BBC National Chorus of Wales, effective in 2020. Tregale is the first woman to be named to the post.

In 2023 members of the orchestra were selected to play at the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

<text>Hsinchu County is a county in north-western Taiwan. The population of the county is mainly Hakka; with a Taiwanese aboriginal minority in the southeastern part of the county. Zhubei is the county seat, where the government office and county office is located. A portion of the Hsinchu Science Park is located in Hsinchu County.

==History==
===Early history===
Before the arrival of the Han Chinese, the Hsinchu area was home to the indigenous Taokas, Saisiyat, and Atayal. After the Spanish occupied northern Taiwan, Catholic missionaries arrived at Tek-kham in 1626. Minnanese (Hoklo) and Hakka came and began to cultivate the land from the plains near the sea towards the river valleys and hills.

===Qing dynasty===
In 1684, Zhuluo County was established during Qing dynasty rule and more Han settled near Tek-kham. A Chinese city was established there in 1711 and renamed Hsinchu in 1875. It became part of Taipeh Prefecture. In the late 19th century, Hoklo people dominated the coastal plains, forcing the Saisiyat and Atayal tribes to move to areas around Jianshi and Wufeng, while the Hakka and Taokas settled together in the river valleys and hills.

===Japanese rule===
Japanese occupation of Taiwan began after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895. Hsinchu became known as &quot;Shinchiku&quot; and, by 1920, its prefecture covered the areas of modern-day Hsinchu County and City, Miaoli, and Taoyuan.

===Republic of China===
Like the rest of the Taiwan, the county is part of the nominal Taiwan Province of the Republic of China (ROC), which s no longer has any administrative function practically. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Hsinchu County was established on 25 December 1945. In August 1950, Miaoli and Taoyuan were taken out from the county area to form Miaoli County and Taoyuan County respectively. On 16 August 1950, Hsinchu City was incorporated to the county as county-administered city. However, the city was then upgraded again to become a provincial city on 1 July 1982 and was taken out from Hsinchu County area. The county&#x27;s Xiangshan Township was incorporated into Hsinchu City on 1 July 1982. In 2021, plans are underway to have both Hsinchu county and city merged into the nation&#x27;s seventh special municipality. 

==Geography==
Hsinchu County is located at the northwest part of Taiwan Island. The county borders Taoyuan City to the north, Miaoli County to the south, the Taiwan Strait to the west, and the Xueshan &amp; Dabajian mountains to the east. With an area spanning up to , Hsinchu County is composed mainly of uplands, tablelands, mountains, the alluvial plains of the Fengshan River and Touqian River mouth area, and some ancient river land.

The population of the county consists of Hakka, Hoklo, aborigines and new immigrants. The Hakka people constituted around 84% of the total population in 2014, while the aborigines consisted mainly of Atayal and Saisiyat people. As of October 2023, the total population was 588,535, with 288,912 females and 299,623 males.

==Economy==

===High tech industry===
After the founding of Hsinchu Science Park in 1980, a high number of high-tech industries began to grow and expand outside the park, attracting workers coming to work and settle in the county.

==Education==

Education in Hsinchu County is administered by the Education Department of Hsinchu County Government. The county is home to the Minghsin University of Science and Technology and Ta Hwa University of Science and Technology.

It once had some leisure centre facilities, including four squash courts, which have now been demolished. Its owners, and tenants for the majority of its history, are Barrow A.F.C., who have played at the ground since 1909. Despite its current capacity being just over 6,000, some 16,874 crammed the stadium in 1954 when Barrow played Swansea Town in the FA Cup third round.

==History==

===Early years===
The site of Holker Street had previously been owned by the Furness Railway, which had used it as a rubbish tip. It was converted into a football pitch by Hindpool Athletic football club, though no stands had been built and the pitch had little grass — indeed, pieces of refuse on the site remained an obstacle for many years after the ground had been developed. Barrow, which had been founded in 1901, and had spent eight seasons playing at a variety of grounds in Barrow, moved there and took a five-year rent from Furness Railway in 1909. The first game played by Barrow at the ground was a Lancashire Combination league match against Eccles Borough, which finished in a 5–2 victory for Barrow.

The first structure built at the ground was a wooden all-seater stand in 1912. By 1921, when Barrow were elected into the new Third Division (North) of the Football League, Holker Street had been developed into an &quot;excellent ground&quot; with fully covered terracing surrounding the three remaining sides, changing rooms and turnstiles. The first match at the new level was against Stockport County, with an attendance of 9,750.

===Football league period===
Holker Street remained a good-quality ground during the 1930s, with further upgrades following the Second World War, which saw the wooden stand replaced by terracing. Post-war attendances were the highest in the ground&#x27;s history, with at least one match a year attracting over 10,000 fans in the first ten seasons after the resumption of the football league in 1946. The highest attendance at Holker Street was recorded in 1954 when 16,874 fans saw Barrow draw 2–2 with Swansea Town in the third round of the FA Cup. Attendances dropped to an average of between five and six thousand through the 1950s and 1960s, though, to date, the last attendance of over 10,000 occurred in 1968, when 16,650 was the sell-out attendance for Barrow&#x27;s FA Cup match against Leicester City.

Floodlights were erected around the ground in 1963, but the next major changes to occur were in 1972. With Barrow relegated from the Football League Third Division into the Fourth Division, the club was struggling financially and the decision was made to create a speedway track around the edge of the football pitch, resurrecting a sport that had briefly been hosted at Holker Street in 1930. Construction of that facility involved the demolition of the &#x27;Steelworks End&#x27; of the ground and the removal of the front rows of the other terraces. Matches had to be played with grass on top of boards which covered the speedway track, resulting in complaints from other teams. Problems such as that were influential in the decision of the Football League clubs&#x27; to vote against Barrow when the team had to seek re-election to the league following a bottom-four finish in the Fourth Division at the end of the 1971–1972 season, and Barrow were demoted to the Northern Premier League. As it was, the speedway team which operated from Holker Street, the &quot;Barrow Bombers&quot;, did so only for two years from 1972 till 1974, when the track was removed due to its unpopularity with other football clubs.

===Non-league era===
Following demotion and the speedway era, Holker Street had become rather dilapidated. The remaining stands were demolished for health and safety concerns, though a cover was retained for the &quot;Popular Side&quot;, and terracing was pushed closer to the pitch following the removal of the speedway track. The &quot;CrossBar&quot; leisure club and bar was subsequently built at the former Steelworks End, as part of a job creation scheme. That remains a dominant feature of the ground and is now the match day hospitality suite, as well as a conference centre. The other major development since the 1970s has been the construction of an all seater &quot;Main Stand&quot; on the Wilkie Road side of the ground. That was built during the period when the club was owned by Stephen Vaughan, and was opened in 1998.

Shortly after that, however, Holker Street became a key part of Barrow&#x27;s financial problems. During the writing of gangster Curtis Warren&#x27;s autobiography, Warren claimed to a journalist that he owned Holker Street. That claim led to a police investigation into Vaughan&#x27;s activities, with the suspicion that he had been involved in money laundering for Warren. Vaughan was later cleared of all charges, but withdrew his financial backing from Barrow during the course of the investigation. That sent Barrow into administration, during which conflicts over the ownership of Holker Street were central. Vaughan had bought Holker Street from Barrow, transferring ownership to his company &quot;Northern Improvements&quot;. Vaughan paid Barrow £110,000 directly for the ground, claiming that the full value of £410,000 was made up by the £300,000 investment that he had made into the club whilst chairman. Following a long legal battle, lasting from 1998 to 2002, the transaction was eventually deemed improper and the newly formed Barrow ownership were able to regain ownership of the ground.

==Stadium==
Holker Street has remained unchanged since the redevelopment of the main stand in the mid-1990s. Described as having &quot;a traditional, old fashioned feel&quot;, the ground has three sides of terracing and one all-seater Main Stand, the latter with a capacity of around 1,000. The Main Stand, backing onto Wilkie Road is raised above the central portion of the pitch, with flat standing on either side. The Popular Side now has the only covered terracing, opposite the Main Stand. This end is dominated by the &quot;CrossBar&quot; which houses the club&#x27;s offices, and which somewhat damages the aesthetics of the ground. Between 1963 and 2017, the ground had large floodlighting structures in its four corners. Three of those were replaced by smaller floodlights; one was kept because it also functions as a mobile phone mast.

The stadium also has basic catering facilities on match days.

The roof of the Main Stand suffered minor damage on 16 October 2017, as a result of Hurricane Ophelia. In 2020, a roof was built on the Holker Street End of the ground after the club had won promotion back to the Football League.

On 19 July 2022, it was announced that Holker Street would be renamed to the SO Legal Stadium following an agreement with SO Legal Ltd. The deal ran until the end of the 2023/24 season.

On May 12 2023, the club announced the renovation of two new temporary stands, made from scaffolding and sheeting, to be erected into the Wilkie Road side of the stadium accommodating both home and away supporters. Some 923 seats were added (371 for home supporters and 552 for away supporters) as well as the instalment of 196 seats into the Steelworks End of the ground.

<text>The Ikon Gallery () is an English gallery of contemporary art, located in Brindleyplace, Birmingham. It is housed in the Grade II listed, neo-Gothic former Oozells Street Board School, designed by John Henry Chamberlain in 1877.

Ikon was set up to encourage the public to engage in contemporary art. As a result, the gallery delivers an off-site Education and Interpretation scheme to educate audiences, and to promote artists and their work. The gallery is open every day of the week except Mondays, though it opens on bank holiday Mondays.

Featured artworks include all forms of media including sound, sculpture and photography as well as paintings. Exhibitions rotate throughout the year so that as many pieces can be displayed as possible. Ikon is a registered charity which is partly funded by Birmingham City Council and Arts Council of England.

==History==

&quot;The Ikon&quot; (as it is colloquially known) was founded by art collector Angus Skene and four artists from the Birmingham School of Art, David Prentice, Sylvani Merilion, Jesse Bruton and Robert Groves. The collection began after Skene bought Prentice&#x27;s painting &quot;Kate and the Waterlilies&quot; in 1964, and the two started discussions about the lack of support for contemporary artists provided by Birmingham&#x27;s existing artistic institutions. 
The gallery was originally conceived as a &quot;gallery without walls&quot;, with exhibitions planned to tour unconventional locations such as cinemas and post offices in a motorcycle sidecar The gallery was then eventually established in 1965 in an octagonal glass-walled kiosk in Birmingham&#x27;s then-new Bull Ring shopping centre. 
The gallery&#x27;s first exhibition displayed work by John Salt. The venue was then staffed by the founding artists and sometimes their spouses on a voluntary basis.

The gallery&#x27;s venture was funded by Skene, but organisational control of the gallery was left in the hands of the artists. The name of the gallery was coined by Groves, who was interested in the icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The name was agreed by the other founders partly on the basis that it &quot;divides beautifully geometrically and was splendid in all directions&quot;. In Ikon&#x27;s founding prospectus it declares: &quot;Ikon is intended as an antithesis to exclusive art establishments and galleries … it has been formed because of the need for an accessible place where the exchange of visual ideas can become a familiar reality&quot;The lease on the kiosk expired after three years, but with Arts Council support the gallery was able to move to the former mortuary in the basement of Queens College in Swallow Street in 1968 and appointed Jeanette Koch as gallery manager.[3] During the next 4 years Ikon held 93 exhibitions and 40 group shows,[6] by which time the lease on the Swallow Street premises came to an end. Under the direction of Simon Chapman (who had previously run the Birmingham Arts Lab) assisted by Jeanette Koch, the gallery embarked on an ambitious expansion of broadening the exhibition programme to include the works of nationally and internationally recognised artists, and to move to a busier location in order to gain greater interest from a wider public. In the autumn of 1972, with increased financial support of The Arts Council together with new funding from West Midlands Arts Association, The Gulbenkian Foundation and a number of local charitable trusts and industry, Ikon re-located in The Birmingham Shopping Centre, a newly built shopping mall above New Street station. The fitting out of the gallery was designed by Walter Thomson of Associated Architects and provided a space four times larger than the Swallow Street gallery and virtually forty times larger than the original Bull Ring kiosk. The number of visitors to the gallery rocketed into the hundreds and on occasions peaked at over a thousand a day providing many with their first opportunity of seeing modern and contemporary art by living artists. The opening show of large chalk on blackboard wall drawings by John Walker firmly established Birmingham as a city with a gallery devoted to the contemporary visual arts.

During the next 6 years, Ikon became positioned as one of the most important contemporary art galleries outside London, attracting both exhibitors and visitors from far beyond the city. Among the artists who had solo exhibitions were Ivor Abrahams, Allen Barker, Barry Burman, John Copnall, Vaughan Grylls, Trevor Halliday, David Hepher, Harry Holland, David Leveritt, John Mitchell, John Salt, Peter Sedgely, David Shepherd, William Tillyer and Roger Westwood. Notable group shows included Midland Art Now featuring the work of 20 of the most prominent Midlands based artists including Roy Abell, Barrie Cook, John Farrington, Dick French, William Gear, Colin Hitchmough, John Melville, David Prentice and Peter Tarrant, and which was accompanied by a full colour printed broadsheet catalogue distributed free to the 40,000 readers of the Birmingham Post. Beyond Destination, a show curated by Ian Iqbal Rashid and featuring contemporary South Asian artists including Sutapa Biswas and Alia Syed went on to tour internationally. Ikon replaced the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery as the venue for travelling exhibitions of contemporary art such as Diane Arbus curated by John Szarkowski, Chris Orr curated by Nick Serota, Objects and Documents featuring works selected by Richard Smith, An Element of Landscape curated by Jeremy Rees, The Human Clay featuring works selected by R. B. Kitaj, and Berenice Abbott.

By 1978, Ikon had again outgrown its premises and it moved to a former carpet shop in John Bright Street adjacent to the Alexandra Theatre.

The gallery moved to its current site, the former Oozells Street Board School, in 1997 with the cost of the conversion partly funded by a grant from the National Lottery. The refurbishment work was designed by Levitt Bernstein, who reinstated the building&#x27;s tower, which had been demolished during the 1960s. Café Ikon, on the ground floor, was designed by Birmingham-based architects The Space Studio and opened in December 1998. Form, Space &amp; Order were the contractors.

In 2011, the Ikon Gallery started work with Gillian Wearing, to create a public artwork of &#x27;A Real Birmingham Family&#x27;. The consequent bronze cast sculpture was erected in Centenary Square, outside the Library of Birmingham, on 30 October 2014.

=== Ikon Eastside ===

In July 2006, Ikon opened a second site in the Digbeth area of Birmingham, known as Ikon Eastside. It was housed in a Victorian former chapel and Sunday school, with the words &quot;Stay away from Lonely Places&quot; prominently displayed on the façade - an artwork by Canadian artist Ron Terada.

This venue closed in summer 2007, but the gallery opened a gallery in a different building a short distance away in May 2008. After being part of the Fazeley Studios complex it closed permanently in 2011.

==Current activities==
 The Ikon has an artistic programme consisting of three interdependent strands.
*The gallery features temporary exhibitions over two floors totalling . A variety of media are represented, including sound, film, mixed media, photography, painting, sculpture and installation.
*There is also an off-site programme which helps develop dynamic relationships between art, artists and the audience outside the gallery. The projects and events vary enormously in scale, duration and type of location, challenging expectations of where art can be seen and by whom.
*Education is at the heart of the Ikon&#x27;s activities, stimulating public interest in and understanding of contemporary visual art. Through a variety of talks, tours, workshops and seminars, the Education &amp; Interpretation programme recognises that artistic expression can empower people, heightening individual and community experience.

Ikon is a limited company, registered as an educational charity. Ikon receives core funding from Arts Council West Midlands and Birmingham City Council and raises additional income from a variety of sources, including charitable trusts and foundations and corporate sponsorship.

==Staff==
The gallery&#x27;s executive comprises Ian Hyde, Acting Chief Executive, Melanie Pocock, Acting Artistic Director, Exhibitions and Dr Linzi Stauvers, Acting Artistic Director, Education.

==Former directors==

*Simon Chapman (1972–1978)
*Hugh Stoddart (1978–1981)
*Antonia Payne (1981–1989)
*Elizabeth Macgregor (1989–1999)
*Jonathan Watkins (1999–2022)

==Exhibiting artists==

<text>José Maria Carvalho Pedroto, (21 October 1928 – 7 January 1985) was a Portuguese football midfielder and manager.

He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 227 matches and 57 goals over 11 seasons, at the service of Lusitano, Belenenses and Porto.

After retiring, Pedroto embarked in a coaching career which lasted 22 years (always in the Portuguese top division), going on to become one of Porto&#x27;s most successful managers.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Born in the village of Almacave in Lamego, Viseu District, Pedroto began his senior career with Lusitano F.C. in Vila Real de Santo António, to where he had been relocated to perform his military service. In February 1950, he scored two of his 12 goals for the season in home wins against FC Porto (3–1) and Sporting CP (2–0), as the Primeira Liga title was eventually awarded to S.L. Benfica.

In 1950, the 21-year-old Pedroto signed with Lisbon-based C.F. Os Belenenses after being offered a position in the Navy Ministry. He joined Porto two years later, for 335.000 escudos.

Pedroto won the national championship twice during his spell at the Estádio das Antas, under Dorival Yustrich and Béla Guttmann. He retired at the age of 31, being immediately named his last club&#x27;s junior coach.

===International===
Over five years, Pedroto won 17 caps for Portugal. He made his debut on 20 April 1952, in a 3–0 friendly loss to France.

==Coaching career==
While still a player, at the age of 25, Pedroto took a coaching course given by Cândido de Oliveira. Six years later, he became the first Portuguese coach with a specialisation taken at the French Football Federation. After starting his career with Porto juniors, he was appointed field coach for the Portugal under-18 team by manager David Sequerra as they won the 1961 UEFA European Championship, the country&#x27;s first international title.

In 1962, Pedroto took charge of Académica de Coimbra. He then spent one season apiece with Leixões S.C. and Varzim SC, being dismissed by the former midway through 1964–65 which marked the only occasion in his career where he was relieved of his duties; subsequently, he returned to Porto as an assistant.

Over three top-tier campaigns, Pedroto led Porto to the third place twice and the second in 1968–69, winning the Taça de Portugal in 1968, He left, however, for Vitória de Setúbal, who would finish a best-ever league runners-up in 1971–72 and twice reach the quarter-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup while he was in charge, notably ousting Liverpool in the second round of the 1969–70 edition of the latter tournament.

Starting in 1974 and during two years, Pedroto coached both Boavista F.C. and the Portugal national team. He won the domestic cup always during his tenure at the former, also finishing in second position in the league in the 1975–76 season. With the latter, he did not manage to qualify for UEFA Euro 1976 in spite of only losing one match in Group 1.

Pedroto returned to Porto ahead of 1976–77, ending a 19-year drought the following campaign by winning the championship and repeating the feat the next season. He was, however, fired in the summer of 1980 after a run-in with president Américo de Sá. He arguably set the foundations for the club&#x27;s European exploits in the mid-to-late 1980s.

For several decades, Pedroto was the manager with the most wins in the Portuguese top flight with 326. His sides excelled in ball possession and attacking football, and he was also one of the first managers to introduce a team physician; he was accused by fellow coach Mário Wilson of being a &quot;master of conflict&quot; and for having attitudes that &quot;bordered on racism&quot;, with the pair being often involved in wars of words. His 322 games in charge of Porto remained a record until surpassed by Sérgio Conceição in 2023.

==Personal life and death==
Pedroto was affectionately known as &quot;Zé do Boné&quot; (Cap Joe), due to his habit of wearing a flat tweed cap all the time. He was an avid fisher and reader, who also took an interest in the occult.

Pedroto died from cancer on 7 January 1985 in Porto at the age of 56.

They also performed extensively at the Watermans Arts Centre with numerous other acts at a regular Asian comedy night called &quot;One Nation Under a Groove...Innit&quot;. Their real break came when they were performing a show at the Ovalhouse in South London where, after a strong review in &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine by journalist and playwright Bonnie Greer, they were approached by Anil Gupta, the producer of what was to become the BBC sketch series &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot;.

In 1994 or 1995 Bhaskar had his first paid job as a performer with Tara Arts, a theatre company in south London.

Bhaskar has starred in a number of British-produced films, including &quot;The Guru&quot;, &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (very briefly), and &quot;Anita and Me&quot;. He also had a cameo as a shop owner in Yash Raj Films&#x27; production &quot;Jhoom Barabar Jhoom&quot;. He had a major role in the 2019 film, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, in which he and his wife, Meera Syal, played a married couple.

Bhaskar, the Kumars and Gareth Gates collectively released the official single for Comic Relief in 2003, &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;, which spent three weeks at the top of the UK Singles chart and was the second highest-selling single of the year. In 2008 Bhaskar made his musical theatre debut as King Arthur in &quot;Spamalot&quot; at London&#x27;s Palace Theatre.

As part of the BBC&#x27;s series of programmes on the 60th anniversary of the independence of India and Pakistan, he filmed a BBC documentary series &quot;India with Sanjeev Bhaskar&quot; with director Deep Sehgal, which was broadcast in August 2007. According to the BBC it included &quot;an emotional journey&quot; to his father&#x27;s ancestral home, now in Pakistan. His first book, &quot;India with Sanjeev Bhaskar&quot;, based on the documentary series, became a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller in 2007. He also featured in a Channel 4 documentary series called &quot;The House That Made Me&quot;. This show, produced by Nutopia in 2010, recreated his childhood home and introduced him to the characters of his youth.

He wrote and starred in the ITV sitcom &quot;Mumbai Calling&quot; and the UK tour of the hit American improv show &quot;Totally Looped&quot;.

On 31 October 2014 Bhaskar hosted &quot;Kermode and Mayo&#x27;s Film Review&quot;, standing in for Simon Mayo on the BBC&#x27;s flagship film show. He also played the lead character in the online animation Rajesh Finesse in 2014.

From 2015 until the present (season 5, 2023) he plays a lead role as DI Sunny Khan in cold case mystery series &quot;Unforgotten&quot;.

In January 2021 Bhaskar was cast in the Netflix adaptation of &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

In 2022 he appeared in the title role in a television series based on the &quot;Inspector Singh&quot; novels.

==Guest appearances ==

In October 2008 he was featured on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

He appeared as a guest on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2003, setting a time of 1:51.0 around a wet &quot;Top Gear&quot; test track in a Suzuki Liana, placing him 32nd on the original leader board. In March 2010 he featured on the BBC Radio 4 comedy show &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen Star Wars&quot;. On 23 July 2010 he was guest on the BBC comedy panel game &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot;.

== Recognition and awards ==
In 2003 Bhaskar was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy.

In 2005 Bhaskar was awarded the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the New Year Honours List.

On 23 February 2009 he was appointed chancellor of the University of Sussex, and he was formally installed at the university&#x27;s summer graduation ceremony on 22 July 2009.

In April 2015 he was given the Outstanding Achievement in Television award at The Asian Awards.

On 26 July 2019 Bhaskar was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Sussex in recognition of his ten years as chancellor.

==Personal life==
In January 2005 Bhaskar married comedian Meera Syal in Lichfield, Staffordshire. They have a son, Shaan, who was born at the Portland Hospital on 2 December 2005.

In February 2009 Bhaskar and other entertainers wrote an open letter to &quot;The Times&quot; protesting against the trial of leaders of the Baháʼí Faith then being held in Iran. He is a Liverpool Football Club supporter.

Before the 2010 general election Bhaskar was one of 48 celebrities who signed a letter warning against Conservative Party policy towards the BBC.

<text>Harding Lemay (March 16, 1922 – May 26, 2018), also known as Pete Lemay, was an American screenwriter and playwright who was the head writer for the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;.

==Career==
Lemay was head writer of the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, from 1971 to 1979. The series earned a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1976. By 1979, Lemay decided not to continue writing the series for a ninth straight calendar year, and first handed over to a new writer before leaving for good later that year. He also wrote out three of the show&#x27;s most popular actors: George Reinholt (Steve Frame), Jacqueline Courtney (Alice Matthews Frame), and Virginia Dwyer (Mary Matthews), in 1975.

Lemay co-created &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot; with Paul Rauch, later retooled and referred to as &quot;For Richer, For Poorer&quot;. Lemay was also a playwright, whose works have been produced both off-Broadway and on Broadway. He was also a friend and mentor to Douglas Marland, who was his subwriter on &quot;Another World&quot; and later became one of daytime TV&#x27;s most prolific writers as head writer for &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lemay was born on March 16, 1922, near the Mohawk Indian reservation in North Bangor, New York, where his mother grew up. He ran away to New York City at age 17 where he attended the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.

From September 1947 to 1953, he was married to Priscilla Amidon. He married his second wife, Dorothy Shaw on September 19, 1953; she died in 1994. His third wife was Gloria Gardner. Lemay died on May 26, 2018, at the age of 96.

<doc id="717529" wikidata="Q5180778" url="?curid=717529" title="Craig Brown (satirist)">
<text>Craig Edward Moncrieff Brown (born 23 May 1957) is an English critic and satirist, best known for parliamentary sketch writing, humorous articles and parodies for newspapers and magazines including &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&quot;.

==Life and career==
Brown was educated at Eton and the University of Bristol and then became a freelance journalist in London, contributing to &quot;Harper&#x27;s &amp; Queen&quot; (collaborating with Lesley Cunliffe on articles, some of which resulted in books), &quot;Tatler&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;Literary Review&quot;, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (as a regular columnist), &quot;The Times&quot; (notably as parliamentary sketchwriter; these columns were compiled into a book called &quot;A Life Inside&quot;) and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (as TV and restaurant critic). He later continued his restaurant column in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and has contributed a weekly book review to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. He created the characters of &quot;Bel Littlejohn&quot;, an ultra-trendy New Labour type, in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;Wallace Arnold&quot;, an extremely reactionary conservative, in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;. In 2001, he took over Auberon Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Way of the World&quot; in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; following Waugh&#x27;s death, but lost the column in December 2008. He also has a column in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

Brown also writes comedy shows such as &quot;Norman Ormal&quot; for TV (in which he appeared as a returning officer) and his radio show &quot;This Is Craig Brown&quot; was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2004. It featured comics Rory Bremner and Harry Enfield and other media personalities. He has appeared on television as a critic on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Late Review&quot; as well as in documentaries such as Russell Davies&#x27;s life of Ronald Searle.

His book &quot;1966 and All That&quot; takes its title, and some other elements, from &quot;1066 and All That&quot;, extending its history of Britain through to the beginning of the 21st century. A BBC Radio 4 adaptation followed in September 2006, in similar vein to &quot;This Is Craig Brown&quot;. &quot;The Tony Years&quot; is a comic overview of the years of Tony Blair&#x27;s government, published in paperback by Ebury Press in June 2007.

Brown&#x27;s predominantly factual biography of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, &quot;Ma’am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret&quot;, was published in 2017 and won the 2018 James Tait Black Memorial Prize in the biography category.

In 2020, Brown&#x27;s book &quot;One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time&quot; won the £50,000 Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction. In announcing the award, Martha Kearney, the chair of the judging panel, described the book as &quot;a joyous, irreverent, insightful celebration of the Beatles, a highly original take on familiar territory. [...] It’s also a profound book about success and failure which won the unanimous support of our judges. Craig Brown has reinvented the art of biography&quot;. 

Brown wrote an essay, &quot;The Slippery Art of Biography&quot;, for the Times Literary Supplement in 2021 and presented it at the Edinburgh International Book Festival the following year.

==Personal life==
Brown&#x27;s wife is the author Frances Welch, daughter of the journalist Colin Welch. They have two children. Frances Welch&#x27;s niece is the singer Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine.

<text>Crest is an American brand of toothpaste and other oral hygiene products made by American multinational Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) and sold worldwide. In many countries in Europe, such as Germany, Bulgaria, Serbia, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, Estonia and Lithuania, it is sold as Blend-A-Med, the name of an established German toothpaste acquired by P&amp;G in 1987 (formerly Blendax GmbH). In France, Spain, Italy, Israel, Sweden, Finland, Colombia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Greece, Uruguay and Argentina, P&amp;G markets similar oral hygiene formulations under the Oral-B brand.

==History==
Crest was introduced in the United States as &quot;Fluoristan&quot; in 1954, as it contained stannous fluoride. In 1955, the name of the product was changed to &quot;Crest &quot;with&quot; Fluoristan.&quot; The composition of the toothpaste had been developed by Joseph C. Muhler, Harry Day, and William H. Nebergall at Indiana University, and was patented by Nebergall. Procter &amp; Gamble paid royalties from use of the patent and thus financed a new dental research institute at this university (&quot;The House that Crest built&quot;). The active ingredient of Crest was changed in 1981 to sodium fluoride, or &quot;Fluoristat,&quot; which it uses today as &quot;Dentifrice with Fluoristat&quot;; Crest Pro-Health uses stannous fluoride again and an abrasive whitener together called &quot;Polyfluorite.&quot; Crest is accepted by the American Dental Association (ADA), as well as by equivalent dental associations in other countries.

One notable ad campaign from the brand was in the late 1970s and early 1980s, written and produced by Gregory Sinnott and designed by comic book artist Herb Trimpe, where animated ads featured the &quot;Cavity Creeps,&quot; a group of grey-colored, rocky humanoid creatures bent on destroying the city of &quot;Toothopolis&quot; (essentially an island city protected by an enormous wall of teeth), with their signature battle cry &quot;We make holes in teeth!&quot; They were defeated time and again by the &quot;Crest Team,&quot; a group of people dressed in Crest-themed jumpsuits, who wielded giant toothbrushes and tubes of Crest to not only ward off the Cavity Creeps, but to protect the wall as well. The team would encourage children at the end of each commercial to &quot;watch treats and see your dentist&quot; so they could fight cavities &quot;like the Crest Team.&quot;

From 2004 to 2010, Crest sold dental floss under the Crest Glide brand, which is now called Oral-B Glide. After Procter &amp; Gamble bought Gillette (which owned Oral-B), marketing for both was done together under “Pro-Health”.

== Manufacturing plants ==
Crest products are made in North America according to Procter &amp; Gamble. Their main manufacturing plant is located in Greensboro, NC. Some products are manufactured in Guanajuato, Mexico.

== Product line ==
Crest has also been associated with about twenty brands of dental care products, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, dental floss, and a tooth-whitening product called Crest Whitestrips.

Crest Toothpaste has a total of eight product lines:

* Gum Health
* 3D White
* Kid&#x27;s Crest
* Pro-Health
* Sensitivity
* Enamel
* Clean + Fresh
* Future-Proof

==Crest Pro-Health mouthwash side effects==
===Tooth staining===
Crest Pro-Health mouthwash contains cetylpyridinium chloride which is known to cause tooth staining in approximately 3 percent of users. Crest has noted that this staining is actually an indication that the product is working as intended, as the stains are a result of bacteria dying on the teeth. Crest stated that because of the low incidence of staining, there was no need to label Pro-Health mouthwash as a potential tooth stainer. However, after numerous complaints and a federal class-action lawsuit, which was later dismissed, the mouthwash now contains a label warning consumers of its potential to stain teeth.

===Reducing premature birth===
The use of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash during pregnancy has been shown to be associated with a decrease in preterm births, presumably because the mouthwash reduces the severity of periodontal disease, which is directly linked to preterm births.

==Timeline==
* 1955, Crest with Fluoristan was launched in a number of test markets in the United States.
* In January 1956, Crest was launched nationally.
* In 1976, the American Chemical Society named Crest with fluoride one of the greatest discoveries in the past 100 years.

<doc id="717551" wikidata="Q964454" url="?curid=717551" title="Jimmy Carr">
<text>James Anthony Patrick Carr (born 15 September 1972) is an Irish-British comedian, presenter, writer and actor. He is known for his rapid-fire deadpan delivery of one-liners which some people have taken offence to. He began his comedy career in 1997, and he has regularly appeared on television as the host of Channel 4 panel shows such as &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;, &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown&quot; and &quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year&quot;.

==Early life and education==
James Anthony Patrick Carr was born on 15 September 1972, in Hounslow, London, the second of three sons born to Irish parents Nora Mary (née Lawlor; 19 September 1943 – 7 September 2001) and Patrick James &quot;Jim&quot; Carr (born 1945), an accountant who became the treasurer for computer company Unisys. His parents were married in 1970 and separated in 1994, never divorcing.

Carr spent most of his early life in the village of Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, where he attended Farnham Common School and Burnham Grammar School. He had said he is dyslexic and did not learn to read or write with any level of proficiency until he was maybe ten or eleven years old. He completed sixth form at the Royal Grammar School in nearby High Wycombe.

In 2001, Carr&#x27;s mother, Nora Mary, died of pancreatitis, aged 57. Following her death, Carr&#x27;s relationship with his father became &quot;severely strained&quot;. In 2004, his father was arrested and accused of harassing Carr and his brother Colin, but was cleared and won an apology from the Metropolitan Police. In 2021, Carr said he had not spoken to his father since 2000 and had not seen him in person, with the exception of an autograph signing after a gig in 2015, where they saw each other but did not speak.

Carr&#x27;s parents remained in contact with their Irish relatives, and the family made frequent trips to Limerick and Kilkee. After earning four A grades at A-Level, Carr studied social science and political science at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He graduated with first-class honours in 1994. He went on to work in the marketing department at Shell, but took voluntary redundancy in January 2000 as he felt &quot;miserable&quot; there. He performed his first paid stand-up gig later that month, having done his debut pub show unpaid only the previous December. He has claimed that a course in neuro-linguistic programming helped him realise how his mind was working to hold him back from following his dreams of becoming a comedian.

===Television===
====Hosting====
Carr has hosted Channel 4 game shows &quot;Distraction&quot; and &quot;Your Face or Mine?&quot;. He presented the &quot;100s&quot; series of programmes for Channel 4: &quot;100 Worst Pop Records&quot;, &quot;100 Worst Britons&quot;, &quot;100 Greatest Cartoon Characters&quot;, &quot;100 People Who Look Most Like Jimmy Carr&quot; (a spoof) and &quot;100 Scary Moments&quot;.

Since 2005, Carr has presented the comedy panel show &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;. The show aired on Channel 4 until 2016, when it moved to More4. It later went to E4. Since 2012, Carr has also presented over 150 episodes of &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown&quot;, a combination of his panel show &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; and daytime quiz show &quot;Countdown&quot;.

In April 2010, Carr hosted the first British version of a comedy roast show, Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;A Comedy Roast&quot;. On 6 May 2010, he was a co-host of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Election Night&quot;, with David Mitchell, Lauren Laverne and Charlie Brooker. He joined the three presenters again for &quot;10 O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;, a Channel 4 comedy current-affairs show, which started airing in January 2011.

In 2014 and 2015, Carr guest-presented two episodes of &quot;Sunday Night at the Palladium&quot; on ITV. In 2018, he presented American comedy panel show &quot;The Fix&quot; on Netflix. From 2018 to 2020, Carr hosted the Comedy Central series Roast Battle. From 2021 he has hosted the Channel 4 quiz show ‘’I Literally Just Told You’’.

====Guest appearances====
Carr contributed sketches to Channel 4 topical comedy TV programme &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; and has appeared on panel shows &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; and &quot;QI&quot;. During a guest appearance on the BBC motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Carr set a new celebrity test track lap record on the &#x27;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&#x27; segment. He was described as &quot;the worst driver we&#x27;ve ever had&quot; and &quot;the luckiest man alive&quot; by &quot;Top Gear&quot; test driver the Stig.

Carr has appeared as a contestant on celebrity editions of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; (won £750 for Helen &amp; Douglas House), &quot;The Chase&quot; (won £1,000 for Variety Club), &quot;Benchmark&quot; (won £1,000 for Elton John AIDS Foundation), &quot;Tipping Point&quot; (won £7,000 for Blue Cross), &quot;Catchphrase,&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, winning £1,000.

Carr was a guest presenter for one edition of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;; in 2007 he joined Ian Hislop&#x27;s team in the edition of the show chaired by Ann Widdecombe, with whom he &quot;flirted&quot; outrageously. Later in the episode, Widdecombe stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I shall return to this programme.&quot;

===Radio===
In January 2006, Carr made a joke on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, the punchline of which implied that Gypsy women smelled. The BBC issued an apology, but Carr refused to apologise and continued to use the joke. He appeared in two episodes of the radio series of &quot;Flight of the Conchords&quot; in 2005.

Carr has appeared on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Museum of Curiosity a total of seven times since 2011. He was the Museum Curator (in his five appearances in 2012) and a guest on the 2018 Annual Stock Take Christmas special, alongside Lee Mack, Jo Brand and Sally Philips.

=== Podcasts ===
Carr&#x27;s podcast appearances go back to at least 2010 with a one-off podcast called &quot;Jimmy Carr and Frankie Boyle: Meet the Comedians&quot;. Carr&#x27;s podcast appearances ramped up significantly during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, with recent appearances during this period including &quot;The Betoota Advocate Podcast&quot;, &quot;You Made It Weird with Pete Holmes&quot;, &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, &quot;The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast&quot;, and &quot;Dane Baptiste Questions Everything&quot;.

===Stand-up comedy===
Carr performs stand-up tours continuously over most of the course of the year, originally taking only five weeks off between them. During his Terribly Funny Tour (which began pre COVID lockdown and ended April 2024) he wrote his next tour by trying out new material in every gig. As a result of this Jimmy Carr Laughs Funny started 17 April 2024.

His first five minutes of stand-up (unpaid) was at an Islington pub, the Tut &#x27;n&#x27; Shive, in December 1999. From 2000 to 2003, he started appearing regularly, around London, at Up The Creek, The Banana Cabaret and The Bearcat Comedy Club.

His first really successful show was a revue at the Café Royal, as a part of the 2001 Edinburgh Fringe. Titled &quot;Rubbernecker&quot;, it also featured Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant and Robin Ince.

In 2004, he threatened to sue Jim Davidson for using a joke that Carr considered his own. The matter was dropped when it became apparent that the joke in question was an old one used for decades by many different comedians. He toured the country with his show &quot;A Public Display of Affection&quot;, starting on 9 April 2005 at the Gulbenkian Theatre in Canterbury and ending on 14 January 2006 at the Gielgud Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. He also appeared at the EICC during the Edinburgh Festival in August 2005 with his &quot;Off The Telly&quot; show.

In August 2006, he commenced the tour &quot;Gag Reflex&quot;, for which he won the 2006 British Comedy Award for &quot;Best Live Stand-Up&quot;. He released his third DVD, &quot;Jimmy Carr: Comedian&quot;, in November 2007. In 2003, he was listed in &quot;the Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. In 2007, a poll on the Channel 4 website for 100 Greatest Stand-Ups, Jimmy Carr was 12th. A national tour commenced in autumn 2007 named &quot;Repeat Offender&quot;, beginning at the Edinburgh Festival.

On 3 February 2007, Carr&#x27;s performance in front of 50 people in London was broadcast simultaneously on the virtual platform &quot;Second Life&quot;.

His &quot;Rapier Wit&quot; tour opened on 20 August 2009 eight shows at the Edinburgh Festival before touring the UK. He released a DVD entitled &quot;Jimmy Carr: Telling Jokes&quot; on 2 November 2009. Also on 5 and 6 July 2009, Carr was the warm up act for Las Vegas band the Killers at their DVD record gigs (Live from the Royal Albert Hall).

In October 2009, Carr received criticism from Sunday tabloid newspapers for a joke he made about British soldiers who had lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan, saying the UK would have a strong team in the London 2012 Paralympic Games. Carr defended his own joke as &quot;totally acceptable&quot; in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He had met with staff and patients at the rehabilitation centre, Headley Court, in March 2009.

Carr&#x27;s sixth Live DVD, &quot;Jimmy Carr: Making People Laugh&quot;, was released on 8 November 2010. Carr&#x27;s 2010–11 tour, entitled &quot;Laughter Therapy&quot;, started with a run at the Edinburgh Festival before touring the UK.

Carr was criticised in November 2011 for a joke about the Variety Club&#x27;s Sunshine coaches, which offer holidays for children with Down syndrome. The charity and Down Syndrome Education International condemned the joke. Carr defended himself by saying nothing should be off limits.

A &quot;Guardian&quot; profile in 2012 said: &quot;In terms of reach and earning power... one of the nation&#x27;s most popular stand-up comedians... in his ability to pull in crowds which generate millions in tour and DVD sales...&quot; and as &quot;the undisputed king of deadpan one-liners...&quot;.

Carr released the &quot;Jimmy Carr: Laughing and Joking&quot; DVD on 18 November 2013.

In June 2019, Carr was criticised for the content of his touring show &quot;Terribly Funny&quot;. Among the controversial jokes were jokes about dwarves, fat women and female genital mutilation. Carr was also criticised by charity Little People UK (co-founded by actor Warwick Davis), accusing him of prejudice for an &quot;offensive&quot; abortion joke he made about people with dwarfism.

On 17 April 2024, the Netflix recording of Carr&#x27;s &quot;Terribly Funny 2.0&quot; tour was released as &quot;Natural Born Killer&quot;. The one hour special attained a Top 10 spot in 29 countries. In the week 15–21 April 2024 Netflix listed the show as being 8th in the global Top 10 (in the category TV, English) with 2.3m viewing hours.

In September and October 2024, Carr joined Australian comedian Jim Jefferies for a number of joint gigs, slotted between dates for Jefferies&#x27;s own tour, in Canada. Their shows were billed as &quot;The Charm Offensive Tour&quot;.

==== Edinburgh ====
The Edinburgh Festival / Fringe is an annual arts festival, in Scotland, that has been a showcase for comedians since at least the 1970s. Carr has often said how important the Fringe is to anyone that wants to get into comedy, and that he is &quot;a performer at night but during the day I&#x27;m a punter and have conversations with people about what show they liked and what they didn’t.&quot;

Carr has said that he first went up to Edinburgh around 2000 to “see what it was about”. Although he would eventually go on to return each year as a paid stand-up comic, he initially had to resort to trying to save money by sleeping in his car (a Rover 75) or on the floor of somewhere that other comedians had rented.

The August 2001 two-week stint, with &quot;Rubbernecker&quot;, was Carr’s first Fringe appearance, with his name in the official programme and his first mention on the Comedy site Chortle.

In 2002, although this was Carr’s second entry (in one of the festival’s programmes) this was his first solo show: &quot;Bare Faced Ambition&quot;. This was the year that he received a nomination for what was then known as the Perrier Award.

The poster and programme billed him as &quot;England’s answer to Emo Philips&quot;, and he performed in the Dining Room of the Gilded Balloon from 2 to 26 August. Records are not kept of Fringe show attendances, but the venue’s room sizes indicate that there would have been less than 50 people at each show.

By the time of 2003’s Festival, the now 30-year-old Carr had built a larger fan base through touring, several appearances at Montreal’s Just For Laughs and numerous TV appearances (including co-hosting Your Face Or Mine).  This enabled him to move his shows to the larger venue of the Pleasance Courtyard, but the Festival’s rules (on TV appearances) meant that he was judged to now be a “star” and therefore couldn’t be nominated for the 2003 Perrier Award.

He performed for 25 nights between 30 July and 25 August 2003. On August 21 and 22nd, he participated in Comedy Gala 2003 in aid of Waverley Care.

Edinburgh 2004 followed on from another hit TV show (&quot;Distraction&quot;); this tour show was called &quot;Public Display of Affection&quot;. This meant another move up (in venue size) with six shows at the EICC (which had a 1,200-seat capacity at that time).

2005 was Carr’s fifth Fringe and he again arrived with all-new material. This show was called &quot;Off The Telly&quot;, and, returning to the EICC, he performed eight shows.

Material for the new tour, named Gag Reflex, had been tried out at a WIP (Work in progress) gig at the Hen and Chickens on August 5, 2006. Trial of the new material continued in Edinburgh across six nights, from August 17, at the EICC.

Carr only managed to fit in a brief appearance at the 2007 Fringe on August 21. Held at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, it was a regular Fringe fund raiser, headed by Alan Carr, for Waverley Care. He was still writing material for his planned &quot;Repeat Offender&quot; tour, as evidenced by him using a clipboard on stage.

Previously, The Guardian had been reasonably positive in relation to reviews of comedians headlining at the Fringe; however, articles from 2007 saw the paper declare that &quot;household names were drowning out more pioneering art&quot;.

The 2008 Edinburgh programme never listed dates or a venue for Carr’s shows this year; this was possibly because his attendance was confirmed after printing. His presence (and the unveiling of his &quot;Joke Technician&quot; tour) was, however, mentioned in &quot;The Independent&quot; and also Chortle.

Edinburgh 2009 saw Carr return for what is billed as his &quot;eighth solo show&quot;, thereby confirming his seventh attendance in 2008. He returned to the EICC with his new show, &quot;Rapier Wit&quot;, for eight nights spanning 20 to 30 August.

He also attended the Edinburgh International Television Festival to be a Judge on a Britain’s Got Talent spoof (called TV’s Got Talent) alongside Amanda Holden and Louis Walsh.

Edinburgh 2010 sees Carr debut his new show, &quot;Laughter Therapy&quot;, a few days after the end of his &quot;Rapier Wit&quot; tour. He was back, once again, at the EICC for eight nights.

Although he performed a number of gigs in Scotland, during 2011, Carr never made it to that year’s Festival. At Edinburgh 2012, he was back to perform his new show, &quot;Gagging Order&quot;, with six nights at the EICC.

2014 saw Carr return for his 11th solo Edinburgh show, called &quot;Funny Business&quot;. Based once again at the EICC he played four nights in what would appear to be his last Fringe appearance (with a comedy show).

In August 2017, Carr returned for a different kind of Edinburgh Festival – the Edinburgh International Television Festival. He interviewed Comedy Central President, Kent Alterman, in an on-stage Q&amp;A session in front of industry staff.

After a 10 year absence Carr returned for his 12th solo show (&quot;Laughs Funny&quot;), in August 2024. He described the Festival as being &quot;where it all began&quot; and performed 5 shows, across 3 nights, at the Edinburgh Playhouse.

==== America ====
In the final months of his Terribly Funny 2.0 tour, Carr made several trips to the USA. Each trip consisted of around a week, criss-crossing the country. 2023 saw these mini tours in October, November and December. He also toured in March and April 2024; this last trip ended up consisting of new material, under the tour name &quot;Laughs Funny&quot;.

===== American TV =====
Early support was shown by Conan O&#x27;Brien, and Carr appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; twice in 2002, twice in 2006, and then again in 2007, 2008 and 2009 (that last appearance being on the renamed &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;). Appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; were 2003 and 2005; &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot; was 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2024; and there was an additional appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot; 2016.

His first venture into making TV shows in the US was &quot;The Strategic Humour Initiative&quot; (hosted by Sir David Frost) back in 2003. It was a joint UK–USA–Canada production, and Carr was chosen to be the UK comedian. Only 1 episode was made.

2005 saw Carr hosting 12 episodes of the American version of the shock gameshow &quot;Distraction&quot; (which he had hosted in the UK). A second US series (14 episodes) was commissioned in 2006.

Comedy Central (US) made two episodes of Comedy Central Presents: Jimmy Carr: 2005 and 2009.

Netflix produced 10 episodes of &quot;The Fix&quot; in 2018, hosted by Carr. It was an attempt to export the UK panel show format to America, and, although still available on Netflix, no further episodes have been made.

Carr was the first British comedian to get a Netflix stand-up special, with his show &quot;Funny Business&quot; (March 2016).

===== American stand-up =====
Because of the frequency of his trips and his workaholic nature, Carr collaborates with American comedians in various ways. Neal Brennan credits him with the idea for his &quot;Blocks&quot; podcast, and Jeffery Ross frequently invites him to be part of his Roast events (the most famous of which is probably The Roast of Rob Lowe). Across two nights of the 2022 Netflix is a Joke Festival. Carr was a support act for Dave Chappelle at the Hollywood Bowl (April 30 and May 3, 2022, the show where Chappelle was attacked on stage).

During this festival, Carr slotted in one of his own tour gigs, at the Palace Theatre, and also performed at the Hollywood Palladium as a part of the line-up for Bill Burr Presents Friends Who Kill, which was filmed for another Netflix Special.

As a member of the Netflix comedy roster, he was also invited to a celebratory brunch at the home of Netflix co-CEO, Ted Sanderos.

The Comedy Store opened in Los Angeles in 1972 and has been a popular venue for stand-up comedians ever since. Carr has been performing there for many years and is one of a small number of British comedians that are listed as alumni and, in 2018, was given the honour of having his name painted on one of the club&#x27;s walls.

Since 2015, Carr has made several appearances on the US live comedy show Kill Tony.

2024 once again saw Netflix host &quot;Netflix is a Joke Fest&quot;, in Los Angeles (May 2–12). Carr posted (on X) that he had performed two gigs in the UK on May 3 and then performed at the &quot;Outside Joke&quot; event, at the Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles, on May 4.

On May 5, Carr attended the Netflix special live stream of the Roast of Tom Brady.

===== American charities =====
Carr is a supporter of the Bob Woodruff Foundation (a non-profit that supports post-9/11-impacted service members, veterans, and their families). On 5 November 2018, he was on the bill of the 12th Annual Stand Up for Heroes event at Madison Square Gardens and again, for the 17th event, on 6 November 2023, at the Lincoln Center.

Carr was one of the British comics supporting Amnesty International at the 2012 Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball in New York.

===Books===
In 2006, the book &quot;The Naked Jape: Uncovering the Hidden World of Jokes&quot;, on the history and theory of joke-telling, by Carr and Lucy Greeves, was published by Penguin.

&quot;Before &amp; Laughter&quot;, a memoir and self-help book authored by Carr, was published by Quercus in December 2021.

==Controversies==

===2011 amputee joke===
At the Manchester Apollo in 2011, Carr joked that war injuries had a positive side. &quot;You can say what you like about these servicemen amputees from Iraq and Afghanistan,&quot; he said, &quot;but we&#x27;re going to have a fucking good Paralympics team in 2012.&quot;
The Prime Minister&#x27;s office condemned the joke. Newspapers and radio stations phoned the mothers of soldiers maimed in battle, recited the joke, then reported their outraged reactions. Carr contended that it was a good joke.

===2012 tax avoidance===
In June 2012, Carr&#x27;s involvement in an alleged K2 tax avoidance scheme came to light after an investigation by &quot;The Times&quot;. The scheme is understood to involve UK earners &quot;quitting&quot; their job and signing new employment contracts with offshore shell companies based in the low-tax jurisdiction of Jersey. Prime Minister David Cameron said: &quot;People work hard, they pay their taxes, they save up to go to one of his shows. They buy the tickets. He is taking the money from those tickets and he, as far as I can see, is putting all of that into some very dodgy tax-avoiding schemes.&quot; Carr subsequently pulled out of the scheme, apologising for &quot;a terrible error of judgement&quot;.

Viewing figures of the episode of his topical show &quot;8 out of 10 Cats&quot;, recorded on the day of his apology and broadcast the following day, almost doubled compared with the previous week. Earlier in 2012, during the second series of Channel 4&#x27;s satirical news programme &quot;10 O&#x27;Clock Live&quot;, Carr had lampooned people who avoid paying their taxes. A sketch from the show, in which he poked fun at the 1% tax rate of Barclays Bank and described tax lawyers as being &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;amoral&quot;, was regarded as having &quot;come back to haunt him&quot;.

In February 2018, Carr appeared on &quot;Room 101&quot;, where he talked about the controversy. Though he admitted that what he did was wrong, he said there was some level of hypocrisy in the comments that Cameron had made about him in 2012, stating that members of Cameron&#x27;s family and Queen Elizabeth II had subsequently been mentioned in the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers tax evasion scandals. Carr said that the law should become clearer by eliminating any loopholes, instead of leaving it up to individuals to decide what is morally right. Carr continues to reference the scandal in his performances and public appearances.

===2021 Holocaust joke===
In a stand-up comedy performance released as a Christmas 2021 Netflix special titled &quot;His Dark Material&quot;, Carr joked:

During the show, Carr defended his joke, saying that it had the educational value of raising awareness about groups who suffered genocide in the Holocaust. The show had been released in December 2021 without comment on the joke but received widespread attention the following February after a clip was posted and shared online. He was condemned by the Auschwitz Memorial, Hope not Hate and The Traveller Movement, who called anti-Romani prejudice the &quot;last acceptable form of racism&quot; in the UK. He also faced criticism from British politicians, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary. The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust said they were &quot;absolutely appalled&quot; and &quot;horrified&quot;, and they described Carr&#x27;s joke as &quot;abhorrent&quot;. Despite the criticism, Carr stood by the joke.

==Personal life==
In the late 1990s, when he was 26 years old, Carr had what he calls &quot;an early midlife crisis&quot; during which he lost his Catholic faith. He has since made comments critical of organised religion. In 2015, he said: &quot;As for being a Christian, yes, it seems ridiculous now, but I genuinely believed there was a big man in the sky who could grant wishes. Writers like Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins helped change my view, but I don&#x27;t go on stage banging on about being an atheist... I&#x27;m just a guy who tells jokes.&quot; He has stated that he underwent a lot of psychotherapy (specifically neuro-linguistic programming) at the time of his crisis in order to help him cope with his loss of faith, and that he is qualified as a therapist.

Carr has dual British and Irish citizenship, travels on an Irish passport, has spoken of his pride in having Irish ancestry, and was presented in 2013 with a certificate of Irish heritage in his parents&#x27; home city of Limerick by the city&#x27;s mayor.

Carr lives in North London with his Canadian partner Karoline Copping, a commissioning editor for Channel 5, with whom he has been in a relationship since 2001. Their son was born in 2019.

<text>The Monosoupape (French for single-valve), was a rotary engine design first introduced in 1913 by Gnome Engine Company (renamed Gnome et Rhône in 1915). It used a clever arrangement of internal transfer ports and a single pushrod-operated exhaust valve to replace the many moving parts found on more conventional rotary engines, and made the &quot;Monosoupape&quot; engines some of the most reliable of the era. British aircraft designer Thomas Sopwith described the &quot;Monosoupape&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest single advances in aviation&quot;.

Monosoupape engines were produced under license in large numbers in Britain, Russia, Italy and the US. Two differing nine-cylinder versions were produced, the 9B-2 and 9N, with differing displacements giving the larger displacement 9N version a nearly-cylindrical shaped crankcase, with the 9N also adopting a dual ignition system for increased flight safety.

2,188 units were produced under license in Britain, with an uprated version later built in Russia and the Soviet Union, two of which flew the Soviet TsAGI-1EA single lift-rotor helicopter in 1931–32.

==Background==
Unlike other rotaries, the early Gnome engines like the Gnome Omega, Lambda and Delta used a unique arrangement of valves in order to eliminate pushrods that operated during the inlet phase of the combustion cycle on more conventional engines. Instead, a single exhaust valve on the cylinder head was operated by a pushrod that opened the valve when the pressure dropped at the end of the power stroke. A pressure-operated inlet valve, which was balanced by a counterweight to equalize the centrifugal forces, was placed in the centre of the piston crown, where it opened to allow the fuel–air charge to enter from the engine&#x27;s central crankcase.

Although ingenious, the system had several drawbacks: the cylinder heads had to be removed to perform maintenance of the intake valves, and to adjust the timing correctly. Fuel economy suffered in comparison to other rotaries because the inlet valves could not be opened and closed at the ideal times.

==Design==
In 1913, Louis Seguin and his brother Laurent (engineers who founded the &quot;Société Des Moteurs Gnome&quot; [the Gnome motor company] in 1905) introduced the new &quot;Monosoupape&quot; series, which eliminated the inlet valve, replacing it with piston-controlled transfer ports similar to those found in a two-stroke engine. Beginning with the power stroke, the four-stroke engine operated normally until the piston was just about to reach the bottom of its stroke (bottom dead center, or BDC), when the exhaust valve was opened &quot;early&quot;. This let the still-hot burnt combustion gases &quot;pop&quot; out of the engine while the piston was still moving down, relieving exhaust pressure and preventing exhaust gases from entering the crankcase. After a small additional amount of travel, the piston uncovered 36 small ports around the base of the cylinder, leading to the crankcase which held additional fuel–air mixture (the &quot;charge&quot;). No transfer took place at this point since there was no pressure differential; the cylinder was still open to the air and thus at ambient pressure. The overhead valve exhausted directly into the slipstream since no exhaust manifold could be practically fitted to the spinning crankcase and cylinders. The lack of an exhaust manifold also saved weight and prevented excessive gyroscopic forces in flight.

During the exhaust stroke, scavenging occurred as the air moving past the cylinder exterior lowered the pressure inside due to the direct exposure of the exhaust port to the slipstream. The piston continued its exhaust stroke until top dead center (TDC) was reached, but the valve remained open. The piston began to move down on its intake stroke with the valve still open, pulling new air into the cylinder. It remained open until it was two-thirds of the way down, at which point the valve closed and the remainder of the intake stroke greatly reduced the air pressure. When the piston uncovered the transfer ports again, the low pressure in the cylinder drew in the balance of the charge.

The charge was an overly rich mixture of air, which was acquired through the hollow crankshaft, and fuel that was continuously injected by a fuel nozzle on the end of a fuel line, entering the crankcase through the hollow crankshaft. The nozzle was in the proximity of, and aimed at, the inside base of the cylinder where the transfer ports were located. The fuel nozzle was stationary with the crankshaft, and the cylinders rotated into position in turn. The compression stroke was conventional.

The spark plug was installed horizontally into the rear of the cylinder at the top but had no connecting high-voltage wire. An internal-tooth ring gear mounted on the engine drove a stationary magneto mounted on the firewall, whose high-voltage output terminal was in close proximity to the spark plug terminals as they passed by. This arrangement eliminated the need for distributor and high-voltage wiring found in conventional mechanically timed ignition systems. This ring gear also drove the oil pump, which supplied oil to all bearings, and through hollow pushrods to the rockers and valves and also drove an air pump which pressurized the fuel tank. The later Gnome 9N engines had dual ignition systems for safety, with twin spark plugs per cylinder which were electrically wired, with the wires routed onto the crankcase and a central pair of magnetos driven by the spinning engine crankcase.

===Control===
Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers, but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.[2] Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. The later 160 CV output 9N subtype also featured an unusual method of functioning with its integral dual-ignition setup, that allowed output values of one-half, one-quarter and one-eighth power levels to be achieved through use of the coupe-switch and a special five-position rotary switch that selected which of the trio of alternate power levels would be selected when the coupe-switch was depressed, allowing it to cut out all spark voltage to all nine cylinders, at evenly spaced intervals to achieve the multiple levels of power reduction. The airworthy reproduction Fokker D.VIII parasol monoplane fighter at Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, uniquely powered with a Gnome 9N, often demonstrates the use of its Gnome 9N&#x27;s four-level output capability in both ground runs and in flight.

===Lubrication===
The lubrication system, as with all rotary engines, was a total-loss type in which castor oil was pumped into the fuel–air mix. Castor oil was used because it did not readily dissolve into the fuel, and because it offered lubrication qualities superior to other available oils. Over two gallons of castor oil were sprayed into the air during each hour of engine operation. This explains why most rotaries were fitted with cowls, with the lowermost quarter omitted to direct the spray of castor oil away from the pilot. Unburnt castor oil from the engine had a laxative effect on the pilot if ingested.

Because the entire engine rotated, it had to be precisely balanced, requiring precision machining of all parts. As a result, &quot;Monosoupapes&quot; were extremely expensive to build, the models costing $4,000 in 1916 (approx. $89,000 in 2017 dollars). However, they used less lubricating oil and weighed slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines.

<text>New York Press was a free alternative weekly in New York City, which was published from 1988 to 2011.

The &quot;Press&quot; strove to create a rivalry with the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. &quot;Press&quot; editors claimed to have tried to hire away writer Nat Hentoff from the &quot;Voice&quot;. Liz Trotta of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; compared the rivalry to a similar sniping between certain publications in the eighteenth-century British press, such as the &quot;Analytical Review&quot; and its self-styled nemesis, the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot;. The founder, Russ Smith, was a conservative who wrote a long column called &quot;Mugger&quot; in every issue, but did not promote just a right-wing viewpoint in the publication.

The paper&#x27;s weekly circulation in 2006 topped 100,000, compared to about 250,000 for the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, but this total fell to 20,000 by the end of the paper&#x27;s run. The &quot;Press&quot; touted a Manhattan-focused, controlled distribution system while a good portion of the &quot;Village Voice&quot;″s circulation is outside the NYC metro area.

The print edition of &quot;New York Press&quot; was discontinued on September 1, 2011; its online edition was an aggregate of Manhattan Media&#x27;s other publications. The print edition of &quot;Our Town Downtown&quot; was resumed in its place, after merging with &quot;New York Press.&quot; NYPress.com is currently owned by Straus News.

==Independent weekly (1988–2002)==
The paper was founded by Russ Smith, who published it until he sold it in late 2002. Smith was assisted throughout this period by John Strausbaugh. Smith wrote a column starting with the first issue, which was published under the pseudonym &quot;MUGGER&quot;; it mostly focused on media coverage of politics, as well as restaurant reviews and personal anecdotes. At some point Smith began running the column under his own name, though still titled &quot;Mugger&quot;; it ran in the &quot;New York Press&quot; until 2009.

During Smith&#x27;s editorship, the &quot;Press&quot; ran regular columns by the radical Alexander Cockburn; the conservative Taki Theodoracopoulos; Christopher Caldwell, future &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; editor; Soul Coughing lead singer Mike Doughty (both under his own name and under the pseudonym &quot;Dirty Sanchez&quot;); Adam Mazmanian; Todd Seavey; Paul Lukas; occultist Alan Cabal; Mistress Ruby; J. R. Taylor; Zach Parsi; C. J. Sullivan; Dave Lindsay; Jessica Willis; Spike Vrusho; Ned Vizzini; and Daniel Radosh. Many &quot;New York Press&quot; writers and editorial staff from this time have advanced in their careers: examples include the author and screenwriter William Monahan, author Dave Eggers; David Skinner, editor of the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; and &quot;Humanities&quot; magazine; author and raconteur Toby Young; author and columnist George Szamuely; Amy Sohn, &quot;New York&quot; magazine contributing editor and author; author Jonathan Ames; theater critic Jonathan Kalb (two-time winner of the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism); author Ben Greenman; faux-memoirist &quot;JT LeRoy&quot;; Scott McConnell, &quot;American Conservative&quot; magazine editor; author HP Newquist; writer Kevin R. Kosar; Sam Sifton, &quot;New York Times&quot; editor; David Corn, novelist and &quot;Mother Jones&quot; Washington Bureau Chief.

&quot;The City Sun&quot; film critic Armond White joined the staff in 1997 and wrote until 2011. He was joined for much of that time by film critics Godfrey Cheshire and Matt Zoller Seitz; many of the trio&#x27;s reviews were collected in the 2020 book &quot;The Press Gang: Writings on Cinema from New York Press, 1991-2011&quot;.

Following the convention established by earlier New York underground papers like &quot;East Village Other&quot;, &quot;New York Press&quot; also regularly published cutting-edge comic art, including early work by founding art director Michael Gentile, Kaz, Ben Katchor, Debbie Drechsler, Charles Burns, Mark Beyer, Carol Lay, Mark Newgarden, Ward Sutton, M. Wartella, Gary Panter, Danny Hellman, Tony Millionaire, Ariel Bordeaux and others. Art Spiegelman was the comics editor in the early 1990s. Ballpoint pen artist Lennie Mace was also among the regular contributing illustrators.

==Post-acquisition (2003–2013)==
Smith sold the paper in late 2002 to investment group Avalon Equity Partners for around US$3 million. Publishers Chuck Colletti and Doug Meadow became the president and C.O.O., respectively. Immediately after the sale, Strausbaugh was fired. After an interim editor declined to stay on, Jeff Koyen was hired away from &quot;The Prague Pill&quot;. From 2003 to 2005, as editor-in-chief, Koyen continued publishing approximately 100 pages each week. From 2007 onward, the &quot;Press&quot; ran at less than 40 pages each week.

From April 2003 to July 2004, the &quot;Press&quot; had a sister publication, &quot;New York Sports Express,&quot; that was a free weekly devoted to sports. The publishers discontinued it.

&quot;New York Press&quot; attracted strong criticism in March 2005 for a cover story entitled &quot;The 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope,&quot; written by Matt Taibbi. The cover prompted outraged comments from a variety of New York politicians. Within a few weeks editor Jeff Koyen resigned due to the uproar. He was replaced by &quot;interim editor&quot; Alexander Zaitchik.

During Koyen&#x27;s and Zaitchik&#x27;s editorship, the paper ran regular columns by Paul Krassner, Michelangelo Signorile, and Matt Taibbi. Many of the writers from this time period, including Zaitchik, went on to work at &quot;The eXile&quot;.

Harry Siegel became the paper&#x27;s editor in August 2005, bringing along with him three editors and writers (Tim Marchman, Jonathan Leaf and Azi Paybarah). He directed the &quot;Press&quot; to a greater focus on local politics. In February 2006 all four men resigned from the paper, after the publisher rejected a planned cover story that would have shown the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons from the controversy in Denmark. Siegel was replaced for a short time by Steve Weinstein, former editor of the &quot;New York Blade.&quot; In 2006, Adario Strange, former editor of &quot;The Source,&quot; became the new editor. A year later, in 2007, Strange left the paper to return to film directing. After being promoted to publisher, Nick Thomas named Jerry Portwood, former arts and entertainment editor, as editor of the &quot;Press.&quot;

On July 31, 2007, the paper was acquired by Manhattan Media, the owner of &quot;Avenue&quot; magazine and a small stable of New York community weekly newspapers. One of those weeklies, &quot;Our Town Downtown,&quot; was initially merged with the &quot;New York Press.&quot; It was revived independently as the &quot;Press&quot;″ replacement in August 2011.

In September 2007, David Blum was named editor-in-chief of the &quot;New York Press.&quot; A former contributing editor of &quot;New York&quot; magazine and &quot;Esquire,&quot; Blum had previously been editor-in-chief of the &quot;Village Voice.&quot; In June 2008, Blum left the &quot;New York Press&quot; to assume another the editorship of &quot;02138,&quot; a new Manhattan Media acquisition. Blum was replaced by Jerry Portwood.

From 2005 to 2007, the &quot;Press&quot; ran regular columns by Amy Goodman and Ed Koch (former Mayor of New York City), among others.

In 2013, Manhattan Media sold its &quot;Our Town downtown&quot; and NYPress.com to Straus News.

==Other contributors==
Matt Taibbi was a contributor in the early 2000s until August 2005. An occasional arts and entertainment critic, and author of the &quot;Slackjaw&quot; column, staff writer Jim Knipfel was one of the paper&#x27;s mainstays for more than thirteen years. &quot;Slackjaw&quot; ran in the Philadelphia &quot;Welcomat&quot; for five years before it was picked up by the &quot;Press&quot; in 1993, where it continued through June 2006. Later, Knipfel worked as the &quot;Press&quot;″ head writer. Stephanie Sellars wrote the &quot;Lust Life&quot; column in 2006–2007, which featured stories about sex from the perspective of a bisexual polyamorist.

<doc id="717559" wikidata="Q66800" url="?curid=717559" title="Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer">
<text>Otmar [[Freiherr]] von Verschuer (16 July 1896 – 8 August 1969) was a German-Dutch human biologist and geneticist, who was the Professor of Human Genetics at the University of Münster until he retired in 1965. A member of the Dutch noble Verschuer family, his title Freiherr is often translated as baron.

He was regarded as a pioneer in the twin methodology of genetics research and in the study of the inheritance of diseases and anomalies. A Nazi-affiliated eugenicist with an interest in racial hygiene, he was an advocate of compulsory sterilization programs in the first half of the 20th century. Among his many students was Josef Mengele, a war criminal who directed experiments on children at Auschwitz.

He successfully redefined himself as a geneticist in the postwar era. During the 1950s and 1960s, he was known for research on the effects of nuclear radiation on humans and for his warnings against the possibility of creating &quot;scientifically improved&quot; human beings offered by genetic science.

Verschuer was the director of the Institute for Genetic Biology and Racial Hygiene from 1935 to 1942 and director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics (KWI-A) from 1942 to 1948. From 1951 to 1965, he was Professor of Human Genetics at the University of Münster, where he also served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. At Münster, he established one of the largest centers of genetics research in West Germany, and remained one of the world&#x27;s most prominent genetics researchers until his death. He became Professor Emeritus in 1965; he received numerous memberships in learned societies. In 1952 he was elected President of the German Anthropological Association. His son Helmut von Verschuer was a high-ranking official of the European Commission.

==Family==
Otmar von Verschuer was born into a noble family. From birth he held the title of Freiherr (baron), a title that had been granted to several family branches by the Holy Roman Emperor, the Dutch king, and the elector of Hesse. He was mainly of Dutch, German, Estonian/Baltic German, and Swedish descent, and had distant Scottish ancestry. His father Hans von Verschuer was a businessman who owned a mining company, while his mother Charlotte née von Arnold was originally from Estonia; her family was ennobled in Russia in the mid-19th century and was partially resident in Sweden. He was a descendant of the House of Stuart through his 6th great grandmother Brita Stuart, a Swedish noblewoman of Scottish royal descent.

Otmar von Verschuer was the father of Helmut Freiherr von Verschuer (also known as Helmut van Verschuer), a high-ranking official of the European Commission, and the grandfather of the Belgian-German actor, Leopold Freiherr von Verschuer (born 1961 in Brussels).

==Early career==
Verschuer served in the First World War and had been promoted to first lieutenant by 1918. From 1919, he studied medicine at the University of Marburg. He earned a doctorate in medicine at LMU in 1923 and a habilitation at the University of Tübingen in 1927. In 1927, he became head of department for human genetics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics.

== Nazi era ==
In 1935, Verschuer became a member of the congregation of the anti-Nazi pastor Otto Fricke, a leading member of the Confessing Church. He also maintained a close friendship with his relative, Adam von Trott zu Solz, a leading resistance figure. Despite his proximity to the Confessing Church, he joined the Nazi Party in 1940, although he was not actively involved with politics. He admired Adolf Hitler, especially Hitler&#x27;s views on racial hygiene and biological heredity.

In the late stages of the Second World War, Verschuer directly or indirectly started to use research material obtained in the Auschwitz concentration camp, mainly through his former student Josef Mengele, who served there as a camp physician.

Verschuer was never tried for crimes against humanity despite many indications that not only was he fully cognisant of Mengele&#x27;s work at Auschwitz, but even encouraged and collaborated with Mengele. In a report to the German Research Council (&quot;Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft&quot;; DFG) from 1944, Verschuer talked about Mengele&#x27;s assistance in supplying the KWI-A with some &quot;scientific materials&quot; from Auschwitz:

My assistant, Dr. Mengele (M.D., Ph.D.) has joined me in this branch of research. He is presently employed as Hauptsturmführer and camp physician in the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Anthropological investigations on the most diverse racial groups of this concentration camp are being carried out with permission of the SS Reichsführer [Himmler]; the blood samples are being sent to my laboratory for analysis.

Verschuer wrote in the report that the war conditions had made it difficult for the KWI-A to procure &quot;twin materials&quot; for study, and that Mengele&#x27;s unique position at Auschwitz offered a special opportunity in this respect. In the summer of 1944, Mengele and his Jewish slave assistant Dr. Miklós Nyiszli sent other &quot;scientific materials&quot; to the KWI-A, including the bodies of murdered Roma, internal organs of dead children, skeletons of two murdered Jews, and blood samples of twins infected by Mengele with typhus.

He was accepted during the war as a member of the American Eugenics Society, a position he kept until his death.

==Post-war career==
As the war was drawing to a close in 1945, Verschuer moved the files of the KWI-A into the Western part of Germany, hoping for a more favorable response from the advancing Allied armies than from the advancing Soviet Army. In late 1945 or early 1946, he petitioned the mayor of Frankfurt to allow him to reestablish the KWI-A. However, the commission in charge of rebuilding the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft decreed that &quot;Verschuer should be considered not as a collaborator, but one of the most dangerous Nazi activists of the Third Reich.&quot; The KWI-A was not reestablished.

In 1951, Verschuer was awarded the prestigious professorship of human genetics at the University of Münster, where he established one of the largest centers of genetics research in West Germany. Like many &quot;racial hygienists&quot; of the Nazi period, and many American eugenicists, Verschuer was successful in redefining himself as a genetics researcher after the war, and avoided the taint of his work with Nazi eugenics. Many of his wartime students were similarly appointed to top positions in universities of Erlangen, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, and Münster.

In his denazification hearing, Verschuer was deemed to be a Nazi fellow traveler (&quot;Mitläufer&quot;, a relatively mild categorization meaning someone who was neither a supporter or member of the regime nor an active opponent), and fined . He was never prosecuted for his research activities during the war. Leo Alexander who investigated the case concluded that no solid evidence could be found, and considered it likely that Verschuer had destroyed any possibly incriminating material.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Verschuer led major research projects on the effects of nuclear radiation on humans. Deeply religious, he also concerned himself with questions of Christian ethics, and argued that eugenics must be based on human dignity and love for mankind; according to historian Sheila F. Weiss he &quot;turned his back on&quot; Nazi beliefs. In the 1960s he warned against human geneticists trying to create &quot;scientifically improved&quot; human beings. But he was among the founders of The Mankind Quarterly, a journal promoting scientific racism.

Verschuer died in a car accident in 1969.

<text>Omid Djalili (; born 30 September 1965) is an English comedian, actor, and writer.

==Early life and education==
Djalili was born on 30 September 1965 in St Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, to Iranian Baháʼí parents Ahmad and Parvaneh Djalili. His parents immigrated from Tehran to London in 1958. He has a brother and sister. His mother was a dressmaker who at one point assisted Iranian singer Googoosh. His father was a liaison officer at the Iranian embassy in which he would provide medical assistance. He was also a photographer whose pictures ended up in the newspaper &quot;Kayhan&quot;. He attended Holland Park School where he failed A-level exams a record six times and faked his results to gain entry to Ulster University in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, studying English and theatre studies having been turned down by 16 drama schools. Djalili cited Jack Lemmon, Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Julia Roberts as influences.

==Comedy career==
The first significant success of his stand-up comedy career was at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1995 with &quot;Short, Fat Kebab Shop Owner&#x27;s Son&quot;, followed by &quot;The Arab and the Jew&quot; with Jewish comedian Ivor Dembina in 1996.

Djalili has performed in numerous countries, including Australia, Ireland, Sweden, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, where he had his own HBO Special.

Djalili took part in a show for Comic Relief after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and also in 2005 he appeared on the British TV show &quot;Top Gear&quot; as a celebrity driver. The same year he broke Edinburgh Festival box office records with over 16,500 ticket sales.

In 2006, Sky Television chose him to be the face of their Saturday night film premières, and he also announced a new tour of the UK called &#x27;No Agenda&#x27;, from January 2007 until March 2007, covering 23 different dates. The &quot;No Agenda&quot; tour DVD was released in late 2007.

On 26 October 2007, he guest-presented the BBC political quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. &quot;The Omid Djalili Show&quot; started on BBC1 on 17 November 2007. The series was a mix of sketches and stand-up material. A second series was recorded in late 2008 and broadcast on BBC 1 on 20 April 2009. He performed on &quot;We Are Most Amused&quot; on ITV1 to mark Prince Charles&#x27;s 60th birthday in 2008 and on &quot;We Are Most Amused and Amazed&quot; to mark his 70th birthday in 2018.

In 2023, Djalili was due to appear in the &quot;Omid Djalili and Friends&quot; show in Market Drayton at the Festival Drayton Centre. Djalili did not appear in the tour due to threats against Djalili relating to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

==Acting career==
Djalili has appeared in a number of films, most notably &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, &quot;Mean Machine&quot;, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;, &quot;Spy Game&quot;, &quot;Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Grow Your Own&quot;, &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, &quot;Mr Nice&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; and provides his voice in &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;.

He has observed that he usually appears as a generic Middle Eastern background character in many of these films, often commenting that he appears in the James Bond film as the &quot;Second Azerbaijani oil pipe attendant&quot;. He appeared as Nasim in 22 episodes of the U.S. sitcom &quot;Whoopi&quot;, starring Whoopi Goldberg, and picked up an international film award for Best Supporting Actor in &quot;Casanova&quot;, starring alongside Heath Ledger and Jeremy Irons.

On 12 February 2009, producer Cameron Mackintosh announced that Djalili would appear as the second Fagin in the new West End production of &quot;Oliver! &quot; at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London. Omid took over from Rowan Atkinson, who had been contracted until 18 July 2009.

In 2009, Djalili became the voice of Yusuf Amir in the popular gaming series &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;. He took up the role in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony&quot; spin-off game. In 2010, he starred in the David Baddiel-scripted film &quot;The Infidel&quot;.

In 2017, Djalili appeared in an acclaimed performance of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre.

In 2023, Djalili reprised his role as the voice of Yusuf Amir in the fifth installment of the popular gaming series &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;. He reprised the role as part of the &quot;Grand Theft Auto Online&quot; DLC, &quot;The Chop Shop&quot;.

==Other activities==
In 2008, he was an official festival judge for the Noor Iranian Film Festival. In June 2010, Djalili appeared in a Meltdown Festival concert given by the Philharmonia Orchestra at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall, performing the part of the narrator in &#x27;Rubaiyat&#x27;, a tone poem by American classical composer Alan Hovhaness which sets the words of Omar Khayyám to music.

In February 2022 he shot two pilots of a chat show called &quot;Tonight With Omid&quot; for the BBC, one version in Persian (for BBC Persian) and another in English.

In August 2023, Djalili appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Kate Garraway&#x27;s Life Stories&quot; series 22, episode 3.

==Awards==
Djalili has won awards for his comedy. These include the EMMA Award, &quot;Time Out&quot; Award, and LWT Comedy Award for Best Stand-up Comedian, Spirit of the Fringe Award as well as the One World Media Award for his Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Bloody Foreigners&quot;.

He has also been nominated for awards, such as the Perrier Award for Best Comedian, the Gemini Award for Best Comedy Performance of 2003, the South Bank Award for Best Comedy of 2003, the Royal Television Society Award for Best Stand-up, and the European TV Award for his &quot;Bloody Foreigners&quot;.

<doc id="717577" wikidata="Q2429447" url="?curid=717577" title="Jade (DC Comics)">
<text>Jade (Jennifer-Lynn Hayden) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. She first appeared in &quot;All-Star Squadron&quot; #25 in September 1983, created by Roy Thomas and Jerry Ordway. Since the character&#x27;s creation, she has appeared as a reoccurring member in both &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;Justice Society of Americ&quot;a titles.

As one of the fraternal twin children (the other being Obsidian) of the Alan Scott and Rose Canton, she was raised in a adoptive home but awakens her powers shortly into adulthood. Reuniting with her long-lost brother, she became a superhero and learns of her biological parents. The character would serve as a prominent member of Infinity Inc, the Outsiders, and the Green Lantern Corps alongside Kyle Rayner as a love interest. Subjected to a comic book death during the &quot;Rann-Thanagar War&quot; limited series, she is revived during &quot;Blackest Night&quot; and served as a member of the Justice League of America. Within DC Rebirth onward, the character reappears with much of her history intact and serves as a member of the Justice Society of America, wherein she even serves as the interim chairwoman of the team.

Jade appeared in the second and third season of &quot;Stargirl&quot; on The CW network, portrayed by Ysa Penarejo.

==Creation==
Thomas spoke on the genesis of the character stating

&quot;Dann and I decided that Alan Scott, a.k.a. Green Lantern, would have two kids in the new group--twins, no less. Coming up with Jade was the easy part: we loved (and figured our pubescent male readers would drool over) the idea of a green-skinned girl, who possessed from birth the powers her father gained only by slipping on a magic ring which had obviously affected his genes.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
Jade is the daughter of Green Lantern Alan Scott and the villain Thorn and sister of Todd Rice / Obsidian. Thorn fears that she will harm her children, so she gives them up for adoption, with Jade being adopted by a couple in Milwaukee. After reuniting as teenagers, Jade and Obsidian become superheroes and founding members of Infinity, Inc.

As a civilian, Jade becomes a model, photographer, and roommate and girlfriend of Kyle Rayner. After she loses her powers in a battle with Starheart, Kyle gives her a spare Green Lantern power ring, inducting her into the Green Lantern Corps. After becoming Ion, Kyle restores Jade&#x27;s powers, with John Stewart gaining her ring. After breaking up with Kyle, Jade becomes the leader of the Outsiders.

In &quot;Rann–Thanagar War&quot;, Jade is killed while trying to prevent Alexander Luthor Jr. from recreating the multiverse.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===

In &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Jade is temporarily revived as a Black Lantern before eventually being fully revived.

Jade later helps the Justice League battle Alan Scott, who has fallen under the Starheart&#x27;s control. During this time, she is fused with Obsidian, forming an entity also controlled by the Starheart, before they are separated.

=== The New 52 ===
Jade and the Justice Society are not present in &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot. In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, this is revealed to be the result of Doctor Manhattan altering the timeline to prevent Alan Scott from becoming a Green Lantern. The Society are eventually restored after Superman convinces Manhattan to restore the timeline.

==Powers and abilities==
Jade inherited the power to manipulate and generate emerald energies similar to the Starheart-powered energies also utilized by the original Green Lantern&#x27;s ring. Unlike her father&#x27;s ring, her energies are self-renewing and allows for powers such as flight. She also possess the power to control plants and photosynthesis. After temporarily losing her powers, she wielded a Green Lantern ring to compensate.

== Other versions ==
* An unrelated Jade, Nicki Jones, appears in &quot;52&quot;. She is a graphic arts student from the San Francisco Art Institute and a member of Lex Luthor&#x27;s Infinity, Inc. who possesses similar powers to the original Jade.

*An alternate universe variant of Jade from Earth-22 appears in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;.
*An alternate universe variant of Jade from Earth-9 appears in the Tangent Comics universe. This version is an Asian operative of Meridian with dragon tattoos that she can bring to life.
* An alternate universe variant of Jade appears in &quot;Ame-Comi Girls&quot;. This version is Jade Yifei, a Chinese teenager and the daughter of a National People&#x27;s Congress official who was blinded at a young age. During an attack on her family, she is chosen by a Green Lantern power ring, which partially restores her vision.

== Reception ==
She was ranked 34th in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

==In other media==
===Television===
Jennie-Lynn Hayden appears in &quot;Stargirl&quot;, portrayed by Ysa Penarejo. Introduced in the second season, she breaks into Courtney Whitmore&#x27;s home to retrieve Alan Scott&#x27;s lantern, only to be attacked by Courtney. After Jennie introduces herself to Courtney and the latter&#x27;s family, Courtney becomes skeptical of Jennie&#x27;s intentions, believing she is a mole for the Injustice Society. As Pat Dugan trains Jennie to control her powers, which initially appear to be connected to Scott&#x27;s lantern, Courtney eventually apologizes. After feeling isolated and emotional over her missing brother Todd Rice, Jennie breaks the lantern and strengthens her powers, after which Dugan theorizes Jennie herself is the source. Following this, Jennie leaves to find Rice, though Courtney and Dugan later recruit her to help them fight Eclipso. In the third season, Jennie receives Sandy Hawkins&#x27; help in finding Rice and helps him control his powers after discovering they are connected to hers.

<doc id="717579" wikidata="Q232359" url="?curid=717579" title="Helen Fielding">
<text>Helen Fielding (born 19 February 1958) is a British journalist, novelist and screenwriter, best known as the creator of the fictional character Bridget Jones. Fielding’s first novel was set in a refugee camp in East Africa and she started writing Bridget Jones in an anonymous column in London’s &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper. This turned into an unexpected hit, leading to four Bridget Jones novels and four movies.

Fielding credits the success of Bridget Jones to tapping into the gap between how we all feel we are expected to be and how we really are.

Fielding’s novel &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1996) became a surprise global bestseller, published in over 40 countries. Fielding continued to chronicle Bridget’s life in the novels &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; (1999), &quot;Bridget Jones’s Baby: the Diaries&quot; (2017) and &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot; (2013) all of which became international bestsellers. In a survey conducted by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; was named as one of the ten novels that best defined the 20th century. In 2024, the &quot;New York Times&quot; named &quot;Bridget Jones’s Diary&quot; as one of the twenty two funniest novels since &quot;Catch 22&quot;.

The movies chronicling these adventures: &quot;Bridget Jones’s Diary&quot;, &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones’s Baby&quot;, all did extremely well at the international box office.

Fielding’s novel, &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot; (2013), explored Bridget’s life as a widowed mother to two small children and her attempts to re-enter the dating scene. It occupied the number one spot on the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; bestseller list for six months. In her review for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Sarah Lyall called the novel “sharp and humorous” and said that Fielding had “allowed her heroine to grow up into someone funnier and more interesting than she was before.” The movie &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot;, released in 2025, has Renee Zellweger reprising her role as Bridget Jones for the fourth time. The movie is based on Fielding’s novel and original screenplay, further developed by a team including writers Dan Mazer and Abi Morgan.

In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Fielding was named the 29th most influential person in British culture. In December 2016, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; included Bridget Jones as one of the seven women who had most influenced British female culture over the last seven decades. Bridget was the only woman included who was not actually a real-life person.

Fielding is currently at work on a new non-Bridget novel.

==Biography==
Fielding grew up in Morley, West Yorkshire, a textile town on the outskirts of Leeds in the north of England. Her father was managing director of a textile factory, next door to the family home, that produced cloth for miners&#x27; donkey jackets. He died in 1982 and her mother, Nellie, remained in Yorkshire, dying in 2021.

Fielding attended Wakefield Girls&#x27; High School, one of the Grammar Schools in the Wakefield Grammar School Foundation. She has three siblings.

Fielding read English at St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford and was part of the Oxford revue at the 1978 Edinburgh Festival.

Fielding began work at the BBC in 1979 as a regional researcher on the news magazine &quot;Nationwide&quot;. She progressed to working as a production manager and director on various entertainment shows. In 1985, Fielding produced and directed a live satellite broadcast from a refugee camp in Eastern Sudan for the launch of &quot;Comic Relief&quot;. She also wrote and produced documentaries in Africa for the first two &quot;Comic Relief&quot; fundraising broadcasts. In 1989, she was a researcher for an edition of the Thames TV &quot;This Week&quot; series &quot;Where Hunger is a Weapon&quot; about the Southern Sudan rebel war. These experiences formed the basis for her debut novel, &quot;Cause Celeb&quot;.

From 1990 – 1999, she worked as a journalist and columnist on several national newspapers, including &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Telegraph&quot;. Her best-known work, &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, began its life as an unattributed column in &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1995. The success of the column led to four novels and four film adaptations. Fielding was part of the screenwriting team for all four.

==Bridget Jones==
Fielding&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Cause Celeb&quot; was published in 1994 to great reviews but limited sales. She was struggling to make ends meet while working on her second novel, a satire about cultural divides in the Caribbean when she was approached by London&#x27;s &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper to write a column as herself about single life in London. Fielding rejected this idea as too embarrassing and exposing, and offered instead to create an imaginary, exaggerated, ironically comic character.

Writing anonymously, she felt able to be honest about the preoccupations of single women in their thirties. The column quickly acquired a following, her identity was revealed and her publishers asked her to replace her novel about the Caribbean by a novel on &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;. The hardback was published in 1996 to good reviews but modest sales. The paperback, published in 1997, went straight to the top of the best-seller chart, stayed there for over six months and went on to become a worldwide best-seller.

Fielding continued her columns in &quot;The Independent&quot;, and then &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; until 1997, publishing a second Bridget novel &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; in November 1999. The film of &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; was released in 2001 and its sequel in 2004. Fielding contributed the further adventures of Bridget Jones for &quot;The Independent&quot; from 2005.

<doc id="717586" wikidata="Q3149826" url="?curid=717586" title="Ålesund fire">
<text>The Ålesund fire happened on 23 January 1904 in the Norwegian city of Ålesund. It destroyed almost the whole city centre, built mostly of wood, like the majority of Norwegian towns at the time. The town has since been rebuilt and it is now the administrative centre of Ålesund Municipality.

==Fire==
The fire started around 2 am on the island of &quot;Aspøya&quot;, in the Aalesund Preserving Co.’s factory, which was located where Lower Strand Street 39 (&quot;Nedre Strandgate 39&quot;) is located today. It is actually stated that the fire started because a cow kicked a torch. In spite of valiant efforts at suppression, the wind-driven fire destroyed much of the town. The fire burned to a point just west of what today is called &quot;Brusdalshagen&quot;, going at least as far as Borgundvegen 39. The last and easternmost house which burned stood where Borgundvegen 37 stands today. In total, the fire destroyed nearly 850 houses, leaving approximately 230 houses remaining within the town borders. There was only one fatality from the fire.

===Initial alarm===
At 2:15 AM on Saturday, 23 January 1904, the initial alarm was received from a manual pull station. Shortly afterwards the fire watchtower observed an open fire in the lower part of the road &quot;Strandgate&quot;. Almost simultaneously another manual pull station signal alarm was received from the Kråsbys area. Two fire crews were dispatched immediately.

===Initial response===
Although fire crews responded immediately the sky brightened rapidly in the direction of the Aalesund Preserving Co.’s factory. The weather was unfavorable; a strong gale blew out of the southwest. When the fire engines proceeded through the lower part of the Strandgate to the fire, they encountered heavy smoke and a rain of sparks, such that the horses panicked and had to be blindfolded and led to the fire. 

When the fire engines arrived on the scene, they found the Aalesund Preserving Co. engulfed in flames and the nearest neighbouring buildings also burning. The two nearest buildings were in flames and before the crew could begin fighting these fires, two more were burning as well.

The storm blew so strongly that people had difficulty standing. The draft caused buildings to burn vehemently generating both radiant heat and windblown sparks which spread the fire. Soon a house on the north side of Stradgate was ignited; a ladder was erected and fire hoses were directed at the fire, but the firefighters were ineffective in slowing the rapidly spreading fire.

===Expansion of the fire===
At virtually the same time, sparks spread the fire to other houses on the north side of Strandgate. Another fire engine had arrived but the water demand was high and the pressure was so low that the stream could not reach the top of the houses. More houses in the lower part of the street and eastwards to Aspøgate began to burn. A steam driven fireboat was brought in service in the harbour near the end of &quot;Aspøgate&quot;. The fire now raged over the entire &quot;Strandgate&quot; and the area had to be evacuated.

===&quot;Prestegate&quot; fire line===
Attempts were made to build a &quot;Prestegate&quot; fire break by tearing down buildings. Almost immediately thereafter the alarm was raised because the fire had spread to Rasmussen’s place in the &quot;Kirkegate,&quot; which lay two blocks further into the city, as well as at the Latin school. Fire fighting on the lower Strandgate could no longer be sustained; the steam driven fireboat had to fall back to a new line on the &quot;Langeberggate&quot;. There it came into action and was able to power four strong fire suppression steams.

===&quot;Langeberggate&quot; fire line===
Meanwhile, fires had broken out on &quot;Tellesbøegård&quot; in the &quot;Langeberggate&quot;. The blocks around the &quot;Prestegate&quot; were given up as lost. The fire chief chose to concentrate his forces on holding the line at &quot;Murgård&quot;. With the combined efforts of the fire engines and fireboat, the fires in the &quot;Tellesbøegård&quot;, the Latin school and Rasmussen’s place were extinguished (at least temporarily). But the wind continued strong, lofting sparks and embers, so that the fire line was jumped and houses along the Prestegate began to burn. The heat grew so oppressive that the firemen were forced to retreat or risk their lives.

Shortly thereafter &quot;Rønneberg &amp; Sønners pakhus&quot; in the &quot;Notenesgate&quot;, which lay about away on the other side of the &quot;Brosund&quot; (open water), was reported to be burning. Fire also recommenced at the &quot;Tellesbøegård&quot;, at the Latin school and in a house in &quot;Øvregate&quot; as well as on the roof at &quot;Murgård&quot;. The fire line on &quot;Prestegate&quot; had to be abandoned and the fire boat again relocated. Almost immediately, fire was reported at &quot;H.W. Friis’s sjøpakhus&quot; in &quot;Verpingsvik&quot; which lies about away.

===&quot;Hellegate&quot; fire line===
Although the fire fighters were reinforced by additional help, as the fire spread, manpower was lost since those who arrived first to fight the fire feared for their families safety. Some left the lines to assure their relatives were safely evacuated. The fire lines grew longer and longer, with manpower spread more and more thinly.

An attempt was made to fall back and create a new fire line to halt the fire at &quot;Hellegate&quot; street. The fire boat was directed to &quot;Apotekerbrygg&quot; and the fire forces were concentrated there. But before they could begin activity establishing the fire line there, the roofs of houses on the east side of &quot;Hellegate&quot; caught fire. Further, the crews dispatched to Rønneberg’s warehouse were unsuccessful in extinguishing that fire. It became clear the outer town was lost. The fire chief chose to halt the fire with the natural water gap fire line of the &quot;Brosund&quot; combined with suppression of the Rønneberg’s warehouse fire.

===&quot;Brosund&quot; fire line===
The wind, which had initially blown out of the southwest, was westerly at day break and continued to shift until it blew without abating out of the northwest. This distributed sparks and embers over larger and larger areas and the fire spread with increasing celerity.

==Evacuation==
The fire started late and spread quickly, leading to a hurried evacuation of people at very short notice into the cold January night. As the fire spread it became clear there was little local shelter to be had and the population of over 10,000 was forced to seek shelter elsewhere. A fortunate few were able to flee by boat. The old and the sick were loaded on wagons and carts, but most fled on foot with only what they could carry.

Most fled along &quot;Volsdalsvegen&quot; (today named &quot;Borgundvegen&quot;), proceeding to Volsdalen and Nørve. Others took the path on the north side of Aksla, which also led to safety Volsdalen. The regional governor Alexander Kielland, reported that over two hundred people spent the night after the fire in Borgund Church.

Only one person was known to die. That was an old lady who went back into her house to get her purse.

==Reconstruction==
Liberal aid was provided to Ålesund both from within Norway and from abroad. Kaiser Wilhelm II had been a frequent visitor to the area and expressed a personal concern for the plight of the population. As a result, much of the international help was from Germany, sent in Kaiser Wilhelm’s name. His first telegram was received while the fire was still being extinguished. He dispatched four ships loaded with personnel, food, medicine, materials for shelters, and equipment.

The town was rebuilt in the then contemporary Jugendstil (Art Nouveau). Modern historians have concluded that the fire was actually positive in terms of city development. The pre-fire city centre was extremely crowded, consisting mostly of old and cramped wood housing with only rudimentary sanitary facilities.

He started reporting for &quot;The Weekender&quot;. Around the age of 20, he started as a rookie and advanced to chief reporter for Capitol Radio (now called FM104) in Dublin, Ireland. In 1990, Cumbers moved to the United Kingdom to work with a variety of British broadcasters, including ITN&#x27;s Channel 4 News, Channel 4 Daily, Sky News, APTN, and the BBC. Cumbers worked both as a journalist and a producer. In the late 1990s, he retrained and became a cameraman as well, establishing Locum Productions with his wife and BBC journalist Louise Bevan, to supply camera crews to broadcasters. Among the stories Cumbers reported on were the 1989 death of Nicolae Ceaușescu during the Romanian Revolution; the 1990 release of Brian Keenan in Beirut, Lebanon; the late 1990s Drumcree conflict; the Good Friday Agreement and Omagh bombing in 1998, the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000, and the 2004 Madrid train bombings. He had also interviewed Muammar Gaddafi in Libya.

== Death ==
Journalist Frank Gardner and Cumbers were assigned to report on the aftermath of the May 2004 Yanbu attack and Khobar massacre terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, both of which had British casualties. The British Foreign Office had advised against nonessential travel there. On Sunday morning, the team arrived in the As-Suwaidi neighbourhood of Riyadh, an ultraconservative area where Al-Qaeda was known to have a presence.

The team was in place reporting between 10 and 30 minutes and a man, later identified as Adel al-Dhubaiti, greeted the journalists and then opened fire on them. This was followed by shooting from five others who were waiting inside a van. Cumbers was killed at the scene, while Gardner attempted escape but was seriously injured. Cumbers&#x27; killer was later sentenced to death.

Cumbers&#x27; death was considered a murder in the UK. In Saudi Arabia, Adel al-Dhubaiti was arrested in 2004. He was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death in November 2014, and executed on 2 January 2016. Cumbers&#x27; parents spoke out against his execution.

Gardner wrote a book, &quot;Blood and Sand&quot;, published in 2010, about his reporting in Saudi Arabia and the attack on him and Cumbers.

== Context ==
A week before Gardner and Cumbers reported from Saudi Arabia, twenty-two foreigners were taken hostage and killed by a faction of Al-Qaeda during a shooting rampage, known as the Khobar massacre, in an eastern oil hub. The attack was an attempt by Islamic radicals to try to drive out foreigners. This act of violence made oil prices increase rapidly. The leader of the attack was Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin.

Later in the same month that Cumbers was killed, US citizen Paul M. Johnson Jr was beheaded in Saudi Arabia.

== Impact ==
A year after Cumbers&#x27; death, Irish Aid established the Simon Cumbers Media Fund in honour of his memory. The fund&#x27;s aim is to help, assist, and promote better quality media coverage of issues in the Irish media.

Cumbers was one of the 48 British and Irish journalists who were killed while reporting abroad between 2001 and 2010.

== Reactions ==
Koïchiro Matsuura, the director-general of UNESCO, condemned the attack. His statement said, &quot;I condemn this attack which targeted two media professionals carrying out their professional work, and who were investigating the ruthless al-Qaeda terrorist network. It is no coincidence that the enemies of freedom and democracy attack media professionals whose work upholds the values of freedom, enshrined in the United Nations Charter, and of freedom of expression, guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&quot;

UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said, &quot;We have to be vigilant and get out and get after them and make sure we deal with this (terrorism) issue.&quot;

A spokesperson for the Committee to Protect Journalists said, &quot;We deplore this deadly attack on our colleagues and call on Saudi authorities to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice in a timely manner.&quot;

Stewart Purvis, a former chief executive of ITN, said, &quot;These are tragic circumstances and they are very dangerous for any media presence in Saudi Arabia.&quot;

<doc id="717591" wikidata="Q311198" url="?curid=717591" title="Real and nominal value">
<text>In economics, nominal value refers to value measured in terms of absolute money amounts, whereas real value is considered and measured against the actual goods or services for which it can be exchanged at a given time. Real value takes into account inflation and the value of an asset in relation to its purchasing power. In macroeconomics, the real gross domestic product compensates for inflation so economists can exclude inflation from growth figures, and see how much an economy actually grows. Nominal GDP would include inflation, and thus be higher. 

==Commodity bundles, price indices and inflation==

A commodity bundle is a sample of goods, which is used to represent the sum total of goods across the economy to which the goods belong, for the purpose of comparison across different times (or locations). At a single point of time, a commodity bundle consists of a list of goods, and each good in the list has a market price and a quantity. The market value of the good is the market price times the quantity at that point of time. The nominal value of the commodity bundle at a point of time is the total market value of the commodity bundle, depending on the market price, and the quantity, of each good in the commodity bundle which are current at the time. 

A price index is the relative price of a commodity bundle. A price index can be measured over time, or at different locations or markets. If it is measured over time, it is a series of values formula_1 over time formula_2. A time series price index is calculated relative to a base or reference date. formula_3 is the value of the index at the base date. For example, if the base date is (the end of) 1992, formula_3 is the value of the index at (the end of) 1992. The price index is typically normalized to start at 100 at the base date, so formula_3 is set to 100. 

The length of time between each value of formula_2 and the next one, is normally constant regular time interval, such as a calendar year. formula_1 is the value of the price index at time formula_2 after the base date. formula_1 equals 100 times the value of the commodity bundle at time formula_2, divided by the value of the commodity bundle at the base date. If the price of the commodity bundle has increased by one percent over the first period after the base date, then &quot;P&quot;1 = 101.

The inflation rate formula_11 between time formula_12 and time formula_2 is the change in the price index divided by the price index value at time formula_12:

formula_15 

:formula_16

expressed as a percentage.

==Real value==
The nominal value of a commodity bundle tends to change over time. In contrast, by definition, the real value of the commodity bundle in aggregate remains the same over time. The real values of individual goods or commodities may rise or fall against each other, in relative terms, but a representative commodity bundle as a whole retains its real value as a constant from one period to the next. Real values can for example be expressed in constant 1992 dollars, with the price level fixed 100 at the base date. 
The price index is applied to adjust the nominal value formula_17 of a quantity, such as wages or total production, to obtain its real value. The real value is the value expressed in terms of purchasing power in the base year. The index price divided by its base-year value formula_18 gives the growth factor of the price index. Real values can be found by dividing the nominal value by the growth factor of a price index. Using the price index growth factor as a divisor for converting a nominal value into a real value, the real value at time &quot;t&quot; relative to the base date is:

:formula_19

==Real growth rate==

The real growth rate formula_20 is the change in a nominal quantity formula_21 in real terms since the previous date formula_12. It measures by how much the buying power of the quantity has changed over a single period.

:formula_23

::formula_24

::formula_25

::formula_26

where formula_27 is the nominal growth rate of formula_21, and formula_11 is the inflation rate.

:formula_30

For values of formula_11 between −1 and 1 (i.e. ±100 percent), we have the Taylor series

:formula_32

so

:formula_33

:::formula_34

Hence as a first-order (&quot;i.e.&quot; linear) approximation,

:formula_35

==Real wages and real gross domestic products==

The bundle of goods used to measure the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is applicable to consumers. So for wage earners as consumers, an appropriate way to measure real wages (the buying power of wages) is to divide the nominal wage (after-tax) by the growth factor in the CPI. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of aggregate output. Nominal GDP in a particular period reflects prices that were current at the time, whereas real GDP compensates for inflation. Price indices and the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts are constructed from bundles of commodities and their respective prices. In the case of GDP, a suitable price index is the GDP price index. In the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts, nominal GDP is called &quot;GDP in current dollars&quot; (that is, in prices current for each designated year), and real GDP is called &quot;GDP in [base-year] dollars&quot; (that is, in dollars that can purchase the same quantity of commodities as in the base year). 

==Example==

==Real interest rates==
As was shown in the section above on the real growth rate,

:formula_30

where

:formula_20 is the rate of increase of a quantity in real terms,

:formula_27 is the rate of increase of the same quantity in nominal terms, and

:formula_11 is the rate of inflation,

and as a first-order approximation,

:formula_40

In the case where the growing quantity is a financial asset, formula_27 is a nominal interest rate and formula_20 is the corresponding real interest rate; the first-order approximation formula_35 is known as the Fisher equation. Looking back into the past, the &quot;ex post&quot; real interest rate is approximately the historical nominal interest rate minus inflation. Looking forward into the future, the expected real interest rate is approximately the nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate.

==Cross-sectional comparison==

Not only time-series data, as above, but also cross-sectional data which depends on prices which may vary geographically for example, can be adjusted in a similar way. For example, the total value of a good produced in a region of a country depends on both the amount and the price. To compare the output of different regions, the nominal output in a region can be adjusted by repricing the goods at common or average prices.

<doc id="717596" wikidata="Q577042" url="?curid=717596" title="Newport Jazz Festival">
<text>The Newport Jazz Festival is an annual American multi-day jazz music festival held every summer in Newport, Rhode Island. Elaine Lorillard established the festival in 1954, and she and husband Louis Lorillard financed it for many years. They hired George Wein to organize the first festival and bring jazz to Rhode Island.

Most of the early festivals were broadcast on Voice of America radio, and many performances were recorded and released as albums. In 1972, the Newport Jazz Festival was moved to New York City. In 1981, it became a two-site festival when it was returned to Newport while continuing in New York. From 1984 to 2008, the festival was known as the JVC Jazz Festival; in the economic downturn of 2009, JVC ceased its support of the festival and was replaced by CareFusion.

The festival is hosted in Newport at Fort Adams State Park. It is often held in the same month as the Newport Folk Festival.

==Festival&#x27;s establishment at Newport==
===1950s===
In 1954, the first Newport Jazz Festival (billed as the &quot;First Annual American Jazz Festival&quot;) was held at Newport Casino, in the Bellevue Avenue Historic District of Newport, Rhode Island. It incorporated academic panel discussions and featured live musical performances.

The live performances were set outdoors, on a lawn. These performances were given by a number of notable jazz musicians, including Billie Holiday, and were emceed by Stan Kenton.

The festival was hailed by major magazines and newspapers, and some 13,000 people attended between the two days. In general, the festival was regarded as a major success.

In 1955, organizers were planning a second year for the festival but needed to find a new venue. The Newport Casino would not again host the festival since its lawn and other facilities did not stand up well to such a large event. Festival backer Elaine Lorillard, with her husband, purchased &quot;Belcourt&quot;, a large estate which was available locally, in hopes of hosting the festival there. However, the neighborhood disallowed that plan, citing concerns about potential disturbance. Consequently, the workshops and receptions were held at Belcourt, while the music was presented at Freebody Park, an arena for sports located a block behind the casino.

Some Newport residents were opposed to the festival. Jazz appreciation was not common within the established upper-class community, and the festival brought crowds of younger music fans to Newport. Many attendees were students who, in the absence of sufficient lodging, slept outdoors wherever they could, with or without tents. Newport was at first not accustomed to this. Traffic gridlock and other contention near the downtown venue were legitimate concerns. Moreover, many of the musicians and their fans were African American. Racist attitudes were probably a factor in some residents&#x27; opposition to the festival too as it commonly was across the country at that time.

Nonetheless, the festival continued annually and increased in popularity, aided in part by 1958 concert footage released as the documentary film &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; the following year.

===1960s===

In 1960, local papers on July 1 noted a string of violent, but minor, incidents in town on the opening Friday. Saturday was much worse, with thousands of people unable to enter the sold-out shows roaming the city streets and battling police. Some 200 people were arrested, a town record. The National Guard was called in. By Sunday word circulated that the Festival would be cancelled. Poet Langston Hughes, on the grounds, wrote an impromptu lyric called &quot;Goodbye Newport Blues&quot; and brought it to Muddy Waters, who was headlining the Sunday blues presentation. They announced a spontaneous performance of the piece with pianist Otis Spann leading the band. Likewise the Nashville All-Stars retreated to their rented mansion and recorded a live album on its porch, called &quot;After the Riot at Newport&quot;. On Monday the 4th the last two days of the festival were indeed cancelled.

The 1960 event was also notable for the presence of a rival jazz festival that took place at the Cliff Walk Manor Hotel, just a few blocks away. This was organized by musicians Charles Mingus and Max Roach in protest against the festival paying less to jazz innovators, compared to more mainstream performers; the fact that the innovators were mostly black and the mainstream performers mostly white was also an aggravating factor.

In 1961, presentation of the official Newport Jazz Festival was disallowed, due to the difficulties associated with the previous year&#x27;s festival. In its place, another festival, billed as &quot;Music at Newport&quot;, was produced by Sid Bernstein in cooperation with a group of Newport businessmen. That festival included a number of jazz musicians but was financially unsuccessful. Bernstein announced that he would not seek to return to Newport in 1962.

In 1962, the Newport Jazz Festival resumed at Freebody Park. Wein did not resurrect the extinct not-for-profit organization which had run the Newport Jazz Festival through 1960; instead, he freshly incorporated the festival as an independent business venture of his own. He was a music festival pioneer and would run many festivals besides the Newport Jazz Festival during his career.

The 1964 festival was the last at Freebody Park, since the event had outgrown that venue also. Festival organizers saw a need to move the festival outside of the downtown area, since the festival-caused gridlock there was a contentious point in the community. A suitable site, actually a simple but ample field, which would become known as Festival Field, was identified, and the move was completed for the 1965 festival. Frank Sinatra played the festival that year, and new attendance records were set. Festival Field remained the venue for the jazz festival until 1971.

==== 1969 – experimentation and excess crowds ====
The festival&#x27;s 1969 program was an experiment in fusing jazz, soul, and rock music, and their respective audiences. The Thursday evening set featured performances by jazz musicians Sun Ra, Bill Evans, George Benson, Freddie Hubbard, and Anita O&#x27;Day, and a jazz jam session hosted by organist Jimmy Smith and featuring, among others, Art Blakey, Hampton Hawes, Sonny Stitt, and Howard McGhee. Friday afternoon featured a rock-oriented bill featuring the jazz-fusion group Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, eclectic jazz saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and the rock acts The Jeff Beck Group, Ten Years After, and Jethro Tull. Saturday&#x27;s schedule mixed jazz acts, such as Dave Brubeck and Miles Davis, with rock, blues and R&amp;B artists such as John Mayall, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, Frank Zappa and his band The Mothers of Invention, and O. C. Smith. Sunday&#x27;s bill featured a morning performance of Brubeck&#x27;s oratio &quot;The Light in the Wilderness&quot;, an afternoon set by James Brown, and an evening finale headlined by the British rock band Led Zeppelin, jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock, blues guitarists B. B. King and Johnny Winter, and jazz drummer Buddy Rich and his orchestra.

Davis remarked that the various artists involved were highly encouraging to each other and that he enjoyed the festival more than ever before. He also noticed and appreciated the spirited nature of the younger audience.

But some clashes did occur. Excess crowds, estimated at 50,000, who had been unable to obtain tickets filled an adjacent hillside, and the weekend was marred by disturbances, including fence crashing and crowd surging, during the most popular performances. Saturday evening&#x27;s disturbances were particularly significant, prompting producer George Wein, who feared a riot, to announce that the Sunday evening Led Zeppelin appearance was cancelled. That show was allowed to go forward as initially scheduled after much of the overflow crowd had left the city, following the cancellation announcement.

===1970s===
The 1970 festival was three days instead of the usual four with an estimated attendance of 40,400. Promoter George Wein reverted to an all-jazz policy after he stated the previous year had &quot;maybe too much rock.&quot; On the first day there was a tribute to Louis Armstrong featuring Dizzy Gillespie, Bobby Hackett, Joe Newman, Wild Bill Davison, Jimmy Owns, and Ray Nance. Mahalia Jackson made a rare festival appearance to pay respects to Armstrong. Saturdays performers included Nina Simone and the Herbie Mann Quintet with Ike &amp; Tina Turner closing out the night. The festival concluded on Sunday with performances from Roberta Flack, Gene McDaniels, Buddy Rich and Ella Fitzgerald.

For 1971, the festival booked the rock group The Allman Brothers Band alongside an otherwise predominantly jazz and soul-oriented bill that included performances by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Duke Ellington, Roberta Flack, Charles Mingus, Ornette Coleman, Dionne Warwick, Dave Brubeck, King Curtis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Herbie Mann, as well as the jazz-fusion groups Chase, Soft Machine, and Weather Report. Many more fans were drawn than Festival Field could accommodate. On the second night, after the recording of what would become &quot;The Dave Brubeck Quartet featuring Gerry Mulligan – The Last Set at Newport&quot;, over 12,000 people on the adjacent hillside crashed the fence during Dionne Warwick&#x27;s performance of &quot;What the World Needs Now Is Love&quot;. The festival was halted after the stage was rushed and equipment destroyed. The festival would not return to Newport in 1972.

====Moving to New York City====
In 1972, festival producer George Wein transplanted the festival to New York City, calling it the Newport Jazz Festival-New York. An expanded format involved multiple venues, including Yankee Stadium and Radio City Music Hall, and comprised 30 concerts with 62 performers including Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles, Duke Ellington, Roberta Flack, and Dizzy Gillespie. This format continued for the next years, but Wein missed the outdoors of Newport which the venues of New York City failed to duplicate.

In 1977, Wein worked with the city of Saratoga Springs, New York, to move the festival to the Saratoga Performing Arts Center during the following year. He established the Newport Jazz Festival-Saratoga and remained in New York City, retaining the Newport Jazz Festival-New York in what amounted to an expansion. The Saratoga addition began a trend of using the &quot;Newport Jazz Festival&quot; name outside of Newport, as in the Newport Jazz Festival in Madarao, Japan, from 1982 to 2004.

During the 1970s, the Newport Jazz Festival pioneered corporate sponsorship of music festivals. Working with Schlitz and KOOL, the festival changed its name based on what company was sponsoring.

===1980s===
====Return to Newport in 1981====
In 1981, George Wein brought the Newport Jazz Festival back to Newport, partly to preserve the Newport Jazz Festival legacy and to protect his interest in the Newport Jazz Festival name. Arrangements with the title sponsor of the Newport Jazz Festival-New York had seen that festival promoted as the &quot;Kool Jazz Festival&quot;. The revived festival took place at Fort Adams State Park, where it has remained since.

Newport, now quite keen to tourism, was extremely receptive to the resumption of its Newport Jazz Festival. The 1981 bill featured a lineup entirely of jazz performers, including McCoy Tyner, Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Dizzy Gillespie, and Art Blakey. The festival was immediately successful upon returning to Newport, although no longer quite the draw it had been in its first years, owing to shifting interests and to the proliferation of competing festivals. Future installments in the 1980s and 1990s also predominantly featured jazz performers, although acts in other genres continued to appear sporadically, including return performances by B.B. King and Ray Charles in 1984, and blues rock guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan and his band Double Trouble in 1985. In 1988, the festival began also hosting annual concerts at the Newport Casino, where the first festival was held in 1954, with performers such as Tony Bennett, Mel Tormé, Illinois Jacquet, k.d. lang, Diana Krall, Ray Charles, Harry Connick Jr., and Wynton Marsalis.

JVC became the primary sponsor of the festival in 1984; Wein stated that the audio-visual equipment company, which had recently developed the VHS video cassette, offered a sponsorship package, and Kool agreed to withdraw its sponsorship for financial reasons. 
That year the event was renamed the JVC Jazz Festival. That year&#x27;s lineup reflected a shift away from an almost exclusive focus on mainstream jazz, and introcuded blues, soul, and experimental jazz performers. Performers included Charles, Gillespie, Davis, Ron Carter, and Flora Purim. Coverage in &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; characterized the lineup as &quot;the most exciting in at least five years.&quot; The festival drew a varied crowd of 7,000 that year.

===1990s===
The festival continued to take place annually at Fort Adams through the 1990s and 2000s. Along with established jazz performers such as Wynton Marsalis and George Benson, the festival also featured contemporary jazz musicians, as well as appearances from artists who performed other, related genres. These included: Tito Puente and Celia Cruz (1990), Tower of Power (1992), Thomas Chapin (1995), Medeski Martin &amp; Wood (1997), Femi Kuti, Cassandra Wilson, John Zorn, and Maceo Parker (2000), Isaac Hayes (2002), Pat Metheny (2003), and Dr. John (2006).

Bassist Christian McBride made his Jazz Festival debut in 1991 as part of the Jazz Futures ensemble of young jazz musicians that also featured Roy Hargrove and Antonio Hart. In 2016, McBride was selected as the festival&#x27;s artistic director and lineup curator.

===2000s===
In early 2007, Newport Jazz Festival producer George Wein sold his Festival Productions company to Festival Network, a company operated by former Shoreline Media executive Chris Shields. Festival Networked owned and operated the Newport Jazz Festival with Wein in a senior position.

Starting in 2007, the Newport festival began serving beer and wine at Fort Adams State Park.

Wein began running the festival again in 2009 after the company that owned the event experienced financial difficulty. In 2011, Wein established the non-profit Newport Festivals Foundation, which has operated the jazz and folk festivals since.

The 2020 festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Booked artists were invited to return in 2021. Citing his advancing age and the pandemic, founder George Wein was unable to attend the 2021 Newport Jazz Festival; it was only the third time he was not in attendance since the event&#x27;s founding in 1954. Wein died on September 13, 2021.

==Notable performances and recordings==
Two of the most famous performances in the festival&#x27;s history are Miles Davis&#x27; 1955 solo on &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot; and the Duke Ellington Orchestra&#x27;s lengthy 1956 performance of &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue&quot;, featuring a 27-chorus saxophone solo by Paul Gonsalves.

A reconstructed &quot;Ellington at Newport&quot;, from his 1956 performance, was re-issued in 1999. Aside from the actual festival performance of &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue&quot;, including the distant-sounding Gonsalves solo, the original album used re-creations, note for note, of some of the set&#x27;s highlights, which were re-recorded in the studio. The new set restored the original festival performance after a recording from the Voice of America (which broadcast the performance) was discovered and, among other things, the odd timbre of the Gonsalves performance. Gonsalves, it turned out, stepped up to the wrong microphone to play his legendary solo; he stepped up to the VOA&#x27;s microphone and not the band&#x27;s. Gonsalves&#x27; performance so excited the audience that the festival sponsors feared that the crowd was on the verge of rioting.

The 1957 festival was well documented by Verve Records, which released 12 albums of recorded performances. The 1957 performances of Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Carmen McRae were released on the album &quot;Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday at Newport&quot; (1958). Those by the Gigi Gryce-Donald Byrd Jazz Laboratory and the Cecil Taylor Quartet featuring Steve Lacy were released on &quot;At Newport&quot; (1958). The performance of Count Basie was issued as Count Basie at Newport in 1958. The notable film &quot;Jazz on a Summer&#x27;s Day&quot; was made from footage of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival featuring such performers as Louis Armstrong, Anita O&#x27;Day and Mahilia Jackson. The film and its soundtrack have been widely released on VHS, DVD, Vinyl and CD.

Performances at the 1960 festival by Muddy Waters and Nina Simone were released as the albums &quot;At Newport 1960&quot; and &quot;Nina Simone at Newport&quot; (1960).

The 1962 Festival is documented in a film released by Storyville Records. Among the performers are Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Bavan, the Oscar Peterson Trio, Roland Kirk, Duke Ellington, and the Count Basie Orchestra featuring Jimmy Rushing, at the closing.

Part of the appearances by John Coltrane and Archie Shepp from the 1965 Festival appeared on the album &quot;New Thing at Newport&quot;. A set by Herbie Mann featuring Chick Corea, at that same year&#x27;s festival, was released on the album &quot;Standing Ovation at Newport&quot;. Mann also released an album, mostly recorded at that performance, titled &quot;New Mann at Newport&quot; (1967).

Albert Ayler&#x27;s performance at the 1967 festival was released as part of the &quot;Holy Ghost: Rare &amp; Unissued Recordings (1962–70)&quot; box set (2004).

An Ella Fitzgerald performance from Carnegie Hall in July 1973 was documented on the album &quot;Newport Jazz Festival: Live at Carnegie Hall&quot; (1973).

Noted for his distinctive falsetto singing style, Kendricks co-founded the Motown singing group the Temptations, and was one of their lead singers from 1960 until 1971. He was the lead voice on such famous songs as &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot;, &quot;Get Ready&quot;, and &quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot;. As a solo artist, Kendricks recorded several hits of his own during the 1970s including the number-one singles &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Boogie Down.&quot;

==Life and career==
===Early years: 1939–1960===
Kendricks was born to Johnny and Lee Bell Kendrick in Union Springs, Alabama on December 17, 1939. He had one sister, Patricia, and three brothers, Charles, Robert, and Clarence. Kendricks and his family moved to the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham, where he met and began singing with his best friend Paul Williams in their church choir in the late 1940s. In 1955, Kendricks, Williams, as well as their friends Kell Osborne and Willy Waller, formed a doo-wop group called the Cavaliers and they began performing around Birmingham. The group decided to move for better opportunities in their musical careers, and in 1957, the group moved to Cleveland, Ohio living on E. 123rd Street and Kinsman Road. In Cleveland, they met manager Milton Jenkins, and soon moved with Jenkins to Detroit where the Cavaliers renamed themselves the Primes. Under Jenkins&#x27; management, the Primes were successful in the Detroit area, eventually creating a female spin-off group called the Primettes (later becoming the Supremes). In 1961, Osbourne moved to California, and the Primes disbanded. Kendricks and Paul Williams joined forces with members Elbridge “Al” Bryant in addition to Otis Williams and Melvin &quot;Blue&quot; Franklin from Otis Williams and the Distants after two members quit. They became the Elgins; on the same day the group changed their name to the Temptations and signed to Motown.

===The Temptations: 1960–1971===

The Temptations began singing background for Mary Wells. After an initial dry period, the Temptations quickly became the most successful male vocal group of the 1960s. Although technically Kendricks was first tenor in the group&#x27;s harmony, he often sang in the falsetto register. Among the Temptations songs, Kendricks sang lead on were &quot;Dream Come True&quot; (1962), the group&#x27;s first charting single; &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; (1964), the group&#x27;s first US Top 20 hit; &quot;I&#x27;ll Be in Trouble&quot; (1964); &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Alright With Me&quot; (1964), a popular B-side that Kendricks co-wrote; &quot;Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)&quot; (1964); &quot;Get Ready&quot; (1966); &quot;Please Return Your Love to Me&quot; (1968); and &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; (1971). He was also allowed to sing a few leads in his lower registers such as &quot;May I Have This Dance&quot; (1962). He shared lead vocal duty on other records, including &quot;You&#x27;re My Everything&quot; (1967) (shared with David Ruffin), and a long string of Norman Whitfield produced psychedelic soul records where all five Temptations sang lead, such as the Grammy winner &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; (1968), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Next to You&quot; (1969), and &quot;Ball of Confusion&quot; (1970). He also leads on &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; (1968), a popular duet with Diana Ross and the Supremes, and on the Temptations&#x27; version of the Christmas classic &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (1968).

In the Temptations, Kendricks was responsible for creating most of the group&#x27;s vocal arrangements, and also served as wardrobe manager, including the now famous purple suits the group wore for one performance. Though Whitfield had chief responsibility for writing, Kendricks co-wrote and received credit for several Temptations songs apart from &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Alright With Me&quot; including &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Pretty&quot; (1961) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Send Me Away&quot; (1967). His favorite food was cornbread, and as a result, Kendricks was nicknamed &quot;Cornbread&quot; (or &quot;Corn&quot; for short) by his band mates. According to Otis Williams, Kendricks romantically pursued Diana Ross, lead singer of the Supremes, and he was said to have been close friends with Martha Reeves of the Vandellas. In her second book, &quot;Supreme Faith&quot;, Supremes singer Mary Wilson writes that she and Kendricks were lovers &quot;briefly,&quot; but remained close friends.

Kendricks remained in the group through the rest of the decade, but a number of issues began to push him away from it in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was uncomfortable with singing the psychedelic style that Whitfield was now crafting for the group as opposed to the romantic ballads they had sung under the direction of Smokey Robinson, his friend Paul Williams was often too ill to perform with the group, and Kendricks often found himself at odds with bandmates Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin. As he grew away from the group, Kendricks began to rekindle his friendship with ex-Temptation David Ruffin, who convinced him to leave.

In a 1991 interview with a Chicago television series called &quot;Urban Street&quot;, Kendricks said he had actually considered leaving the group as early as 1965, even though that was when the band was finally starting to take off, because of things that &quot;weren&#x27;t quite proper.&quot; Kendricks explained that they were working with people that &quot;didn&#x27;t have their best interests at heart.&quot; However, he initially decided to stay in the group because Kendricks worried that he would not get the support he needed if he left. Kendricks also said that his relationship with Berry Gordy was less than cordial. He stated: &quot;Berry Gordy is a man I don&#x27;t know, I only met him about three times,&quot; and added, &quot;I know he didn&#x27;t particularly care for me.&quot; Kendricks stated that he did not agree with many decisions that were made.

After one final altercation with Williams and Franklin during a run at the Copacabana nightclub in November 1970, Kendricks walked off after the first night and did not return, and it was mutually decided he would leave the group. While working on his first solo album, Kendricks recorded one last hit single with the Temptations, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)&quot;. By the time the record reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 in April 1971, Kendricks had signed a solo deal with Motown&#x27;s Tamla division and was preparing the release of his first solo album, &quot;All By Myself&quot;. However, many of his problems with Motown would reoccur.

===Solo career and later years: 1971–1992===
Kendricks&#x27; solo career began slowly; he endured two years of singles that missed the Top 40, while the Temptations continued with their string of Norman Whitfield-helmed hits (one of which, &quot;Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)&quot;, was written as a jab towards Kendricks and Ruffin). Despite enjoying only a modicum of commercial success and radio airplay, Kendricks&#x27; 1972 album &quot;People... Hold On&quot; (recorded with his touring group, the Young Senators, composed of Jimi Dougans, Frank Hooker, LeRoy Fleming, Wornell Jones, David Lecraft, James Drummer Johnson, and John Engram) was a cornerstone of DJ playlists in downtown New York&#x27;s nascent disco scene. The expansive, eight-minute take on &quot;Girl You Need a Change of Mind&quot;, which peaked at number 13 on the soul chart, was a particular favorite at David Mancuso&#x27;s Loft. The single was later remade by R&amp;B singer D&#x27;Angelo for the &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; soundtrack. As the dance craze seeped through into other cities, Kendricks scored a number one pop hit in 1973 with the Frank Wilson-produced &quot;Keep on Truckin&#x27;&quot;, becoming the only member of the Temptations to register a number one hit in the U.S. as a solo artist. As well as reaching number 18 in the UK, it sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Further hits included 1974&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Down&quot; (US number 2, UK number 39) and another million selling release, &quot;Son of Sagittarius&quot; (US number 28) from the same year, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Shoeshine Boy&quot; (US number 18), and 1976&#x27;s &quot;He&#x27;s a Friend&quot; (US number 36). Another notable song is &quot;Intimate Friends&quot; (1977), which was sampled for the Alicia Keys song &quot;Unbreakable&quot;, &quot;A Penny for My Thoughts&quot; by Common, Sparkle&#x27;s &quot;Time to Move on&quot; on her self-titled first studio album, and for Sweet Sable&#x27;s &quot;Old Time&#x27;s Sake&quot; from the soundtrack for the 1994 2pac film, &quot;Above the Rim&quot;. Erykah Badu also sampled &quot;Intimate Friends&quot; for her song &quot;Fall in Love (Your Funeral)&quot;, as well as his song &quot;My People... Hold on&quot; for her song &quot;My People&quot; on her album &quot;New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)&quot;.

Exasperated by a lack of creative and financial control, Kendricks left Motown in 1978. He moved first to Arista Records and later to Atlantic Records. By this time, his popularity had waned, and Kendricks was also gradually losing his upper range as a result of chain smoking.

Kendricks and Ruffin re-joined the Temptations for a well-received 1982 reunion tour. The group, then a seven-piece act, also recorded a reunion album, and enjoyed a hit with the Rick James-written-and-produced &quot;Standing on the Top&quot;. Kendricks sang a few lead lines on the song but had no leads on any of the LP&#x27;s other tracks. In an interview with Tom Meros, Dennis Edwards, Kendricks&#x27; former Temptations bandmate, claimed that Kendricks had problems hitting the higher notes during recording sessions for the album. Because of his singing difficulty, Edwards said that Kendricks went to a physician to examine his vocal ability. The physician discovered a &quot;pin drop&quot; of cancer on one of his lungs. However, Kendricks reportedly refused to undergo chemotherapy at the time because of fear that he would lose his hair.

Ruffin and Kendrick (Kendricks dropped the &quot;s&quot; from his stage name during the 1980s) reportedly met up one night when Ruffin went to watch Kendrick perform in a nightclub; Kendrick spotted Ruffin in the crowd, pointed him out, and invited him to come up on stage and perform with him. Afterward they talked about touring on their own and recorded an album as a duo for RCA in 1988.

Earlier, in 1985, they participated in the Hall &amp; Oates live album, &quot;Live at The Apollo&quot;, recorded at a benefit at New York City&#x27;s Apollo Theater; and sang with the duo at Live Aid in Philadelphia and the MTV Video Music Awards in New York. Hall &amp; Oates have cited Kendrick and Ruffin specifically, and the Temptations in general, as a major influence. Ruffin started touring with Kendrick as a duo act in 1985. The live medley of &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; and &quot;My Girl&quot; was released as a single, reaching number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 12 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and number 40 on the R&amp;B chart. The single earned them a Grammy nomination.

In 1989, Kendrick, Ruffin, and their Temptations bandmates were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. There, Kendrick and Ruffin made plans with fellow former Temptation Dennis Edwards to tour and record as &quot;Ruffin/Kendrick/Edwards, Former Leads of the Temptations&quot;. The Ruffin/Kendrick/ Edwards project was cut short in 1991, when Kendrick was diagnosed with lung cancer and David Ruffin died of a drug overdose, although Kendrick and Edwards continued to tour for the remainder of 1991. After having surgery in late 1991, Kendricks resumed touring through the summer of 1992.

==Death==
In late 1991 Kendricks, by now living in his native Birmingham, Alabama underwent surgery to have one of his lungs removed in the hope of preventing the spread of cancer. Kendricks believed the disease was caused by his 30 years of smoking. Kendricks continued to tour through the summer of 1992, when he fell ill again and was hospitalized.

On October 5, 1992, Kendricks died of lung cancer at Baptist Medical Center-Princeton in Birmingham; he was 52 years old. Kendricks was survived by his three children: Parris, Aika, and Paul Kendricks (named after Paul Williams). A funeral service was held at the First Baptist Church in Ensley, Alabama and Kendricks was buried in Elmwood Cemetery, Birmingham. Friends and fans paid tribute to him at four concerts, held at the Strand in Los Angeles, on October 16 and October 17, 1992. Performers including Bobby Womack, Chaka Khan, Mary Wilson, and Vesta Willams sang Temptations songs, as well as some of their own.

==Legacy==
Kendricks was nominated for four Grammy Awards, winning one for &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; with the Temptations in 1969. The Temptations received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013. In 1998, NBC aired &quot;The Temptations&quot;, a four-hour television miniseries based upon an autobiographical book by Otis Williams. Kendricks was portrayed by actor Terron Brooks.

On October 16, 1999, Eddie Kendrick Memorial Park, located on the corner of 18th Street and 4th Avenue North, was dedicated to Birmingham native Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. The park uses Kendricks&#x27; family name without the &quot;s&quot;, which was added early in his career. The memorial features a bronze sculpture of Kendricks by local artist Ron McDowell as well as sculptures of the other Temptations, set into a granite wall. Inscribed on the granite are the names of Temptations&#x27; hit songs. Recorded music can be heard throughout the park, featuring songs by Kendricks and the Temptations.

In 1989, Kendricks was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Temptations. 
Rapper Kendrick Lamar was named by his mother after Kendricks. In 2019, Kendricks was inducted as a solo artist into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

<text>USS &quot;Pike&quot; (SS–173), a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine in the United States Navy, was laid down on 20 December 1933 by Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 12 September 1935, sponsored by Jane Logan Snyder, and commissioned on 2 December 1935. &quot;Pike&quot; was the first all-welded submarine. The welded hull allowed Pike to submerge to much greater depths than her predecessors and at the same time provided greater protection against depth-charge attacks. 

==Service history==
After a shakedown in the Atlantic, &quot;Pike&quot; departed Newport, Rhode Island on 10 February 1937, and proceeded via the Panama Canal to Naval Station San Diego. In 1937-1938, she participated in maneuvers near Hawaii. Entering Manila Bay on 1 December 1939, she served with Submarine Squadron 5 (SubRon 5) out of Cavite, Philippines, Departing on 20 June 1940, she cruised along the coast of China from Shanghai to Tsingtao, returning to Cavite on 24 August.

===War patrol #1===
In response to the Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor, she put to sea on 8 December, to guard sea lanes between Manila and Hong Kong.

===War patrol #2===

&quot;Pike&quot; sailed from Manila on 31 December 1941.

On 1 January 1942 she sighted the hospital ship SS Mactan.

On 10 January she sighted .

On 12 January she sighted the . &quot;Shirataka&quot; was heard &quot;pinging&quot; in the supersonic range.

On 18 January she possibly sighted the , although there was no positive identification.

During this patrol she reported numerous aircraft sightings.

She moored at Port Darwin, Australia, 24 January 1942.

===War patrol #3===
On her third war patrol from 5 February-28 March, she detected enemy craft off the Alor Islands on 20 and 24 February, and off Lombok Strait on the 28 February 1942.

===War patrol #4===
On her fourth war patrol, she sailed from Fremantle, Western Australia, on 19 April, and patrolled north of the Palau Islands and off Wake Island, before reaching Honolulu on 25 May 1942.

===War patrol #5===
From 30 May – 9 June 1942, she patrolled north of Oahu.

===War patrol #6===
Overhauled at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California, she guided bombers to Wake Island in December, and escaped a severe depth-charging on 14 January 1943 during an attempted attack off Japan.

===War patrol #7===
Departing Pearl Harbor on 31 March 1943, she fired torpedoes at targets off Truk from 12–14 April, and shelled Satawan Island on the 25th.

===War patrol #8===
Getting under way from Pearl Harbor on 22 July 1943 for her eighth war patrol, &quot;Pike&quot; sank 2,022-ton Japanese cargo ship &quot;Shoju Maru&quot; near Marcus Island 5 August.

On 6 August, &quot;Pike&quot; attacked and damaged a 22,500 ton &quot;Kasuga&quot;-class aircraft carrier under escort by a &quot;Fubuki&quot;-class destroyer.

On 22 August, &quot;Pike&quot; sighted a Japanese convoy consisting of six cargo vessels with a &quot;Chidori&quot;-class torpedo boat escort. &quot;Pike&quot; attacked the convoy at night, damaging two ships, one of which was determined to be a 2,500 ton &quot;Gosei&quot;-class freighter, the other was an unidentified 4,000 ton freighter.

Sailing from Pearl Harbor on 28 September, she arrived at New London, Connecticut, 3 November 1943. During the remainder of World War II, she trained submarine crews at the Naval Submarine Base New London.

==Decommissioned==
&quot;Pike&quot; was decommissioned on 15 November 1945 at Boston, Massachusetts, she became a Naval Reserve training ship at Baltimore, Maryland, in September 1946. Upon completion of this duty, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 February 1956, and sold for scrapping on 14 January 1957.

<text>The Kuskokwim River or Kusko River (Yupʼik: &quot;Kusquqvak&quot;; Deg Xinag: &quot;Digenegh&quot;; Upper Kuskokwim: &quot;Dichinanekʼ&quot;; (&quot;Kuskokvim&quot;)) is a river, long, in Southwest Alaska in the United States. It is the ninth largest river in the United States by average discharge volume at its mouth and seventeenth largest by basin drainage area. The Kuskokwim River is the longest river system contained entirely within a single U.S. state.

The river provides the principal drainage for an area of the remote Alaska Interior on the north and west side of the Alaska Range, flowing southwest into Kuskokwim Bay on the Bering Sea. The highest point in its watershed is Mount Russell. Except for its headwaters in the mountains, the river is broad and flat for its entire course, making it a useful transportation route for many types of watercraft, as well as road vehicles during the winter when it is frozen over. It is the longest free flowing river in the United States.

&quot;Kuskokwim&quot; is a loose transliteration of a Yupʼik word. It is a compound word meaning big slow moving thing.

The Alaska Natives of Kuskokwim are Yupʼik Eskimo on the lower Kuskokwim, Deg Xitʼan Athabaskan on the middle Kuskokwim, Upper Kuskokwim Athabaskan on the upper Kuskokwim, and Koyukon Athabaskan on the North Fork, Lake Minchumina.

== Name ==

The river&#x27;s name comes from the Yup&#x27;ik, &quot;kusquqviim&quot;, recorded by a Russian sailor in 1826. The Tanana (Athabaskan) name for the river was &quot;Chin-ana&quot;. &quot;Upper Kuskokwim&quot; (Kolchan) is often used to mean the people of the upper parts of the river, while Yup&#x27;ik people live along the lower river.

==Course==
The river is formed by the confluence of East Fork Kuskokwim River and North Fork Kuskokwim River, east of Medfra. From there it flows southwest to Kuskokwim Bay and the Bering Sea.

The Kuskokwim is fed by several forks in central and south-central Alaska. The North Fork (250 mi/400 km) rises in the Kuskokwim Mountains approximately 200 miles (320 km) WSW of Fairbanks and flows southwest in a broad valley. The South Fork (200 mi/320 km) rises in the southwestern end of the Alaska Range west of Mount Gerdine and flows north-northwest through the mountains, past Nikolai, receiving other streams that descend from the Alaska Range northwest of Denali. The two forks join near Medfra, and from there the main stem of the Kuskokwim flows southwest, past McGrath, in a remote valley between the Kuskokwim Mountains to the north and the Alaska Range to the south.

In southwest Alaska the river emerges from the Kuskokwim Mountains in a vast lake-studded alluvial plain south of the Yukon River, surrounded by large spruce forests. It passes a series of Yup&#x27;ik villages, including Aniak, and approaches within 50 mi (80 km) of the Yukon before diverging southwest. Southwest of Bethel, the largest community on the river, it broadens into a wide marshy delta that enters Kuskokwim Bay approximately 50 mi (80 km) SSW of Bethel. The lower river below Aniak is located within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge.

The river receives the Big River from the south approximately 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Medfra. It receives the Swift, Stony, and Holitna rivers from the south at the southern end of the Kuskokwim Mountains before emerging on the coastal plain. It receives the Aniak River from the south at Aniak. Approximately 20 miles (32 km) upstream from Bethel it receives the Kisaralik and Kwethluk rivers from the south. It receives the Eek River from the east at Eek near its mouth on Kuskokwim Bay.

== History ==

The principal economic activities along the river have historically been fur trapping and fishing. Subsistence fishing for salmon and whitefish provides a staple of the Yup&#x27;ik diet along the river. Economic deposits of placer gold were discovered in 1901 near Aniak. Mineral production in the region has mainly been from scattered placer gold deposits that through 2004 had produced a total of 3.5 million troy ounces of gold. The primary route of the Iditarod Trail follows the South Fork Kuskokwim River out of the Alaska Range and crosses the main stem of the river near McGrath.

<text>Holger Voss is a German Internet user who was sued in January 2003 for a sarcastic comment pertaining to the September 11, 2001 attacks in an Internet discussion forum, a case that attracted nationwide attention in Germany.

Voss&#x27;s comment was originally made on June 21, 2002, during a discussion relating to an article in German net magazine Telepolis; it ended with the statement &quot;If you find sarcasm, please reuse it&quot; (&quot;Wer Sarkasmus findet, der/die möge ihn bitte weiterverwenden&quot;). Voss posted his comment in response to another poster&#x27;s comment that endorsed the 9/11 attacks. Voss also added a postscript to his comment, in which he remarked that he had added that original poster and another forum user to a blocklist, since he (Voss) ostensibly took their comments at face value and accused them of &quot;Volksverhetzung&quot;. (The original poster in turn accused Voss of being serious.)

Voss was subsequently charged, following an anonymous report to the police; he received a penalty order for an amount of 1500 euros, which he appealed and was summoned to a court hearing on January 8, 2003, by the Münster County Court. Voss was acquitted of the charge of assentingly accepting that an unbiased reader might interpret his statements as an approval of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the same day (cf. §140 Criminal Code); during the course of the trial, it was also revealed that his disclaimer of the posting as sarcasm had been left out of the legal documents that were provided to the prosecutor by the law enforcement agencies.

The case raised considerable attention in Germany, both for its free-speech implications and its implications regarding the liability of Internet forum providers for statements made by their members. Voss also claimed that the Internet service provider T-Online saved his dynamic IP address, which was turned over to law enforcement agencies without a judge&#x27;s order for several months in disagreement with German laws, which allow the saving of IP addresses for as long as is necessary for billing, and he initiated legal action in a separate case, which he won on January 25, 2006.

On October 26, 2006, the Federal Court of Justice decided to refuse the complaint from T-Online, whereby the judgement from January 25, 2006 became law.

<text>Strafgesetzbuch (, literally &quot;penal law book&quot;), abbreviated to StGB, is the German penal code.

== History ==
In Germany the &quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot; goes back to the Penal Code of the German Empire passed in the year 1871 on May 15 in Reichstag which was largely identical to the Penal Code of the North German Confederation from 1870. It came into effect on January 1, 1872.

This &quot;Reichsstrafgesetzbuch&quot; (Imperial Penal Code) was changed many times in the following decades in response not only to changing moral concepts and constitutional provision granted by the &quot;Grundgesetz&quot;, but also to scientific and technical reforms. Examples of such new crimes are money laundering or computer sabotage.

The Penal Code is a codification of criminal law and the pivotal legal text, while supplementary laws contain provisions affecting criminal law, such as definitions of new types of crime and law enforcement action. The StGB constitutes the legal basis of criminal law in Germany.

After the defeat of Nazi Germany, a number of prohibiting provisions were included in the &quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot;:
* &quot;Friedensverrat&quot; (&quot;treason to peace&quot;): preparation of a war of aggression (§ 80; since 2017 § 13 Völkerstrafgesetzbuch) and incitement to a war of aggression (§ 80a)
* dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organizations (§ 86)
* use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations (§ 86a)
* incitement to hatred against segments of the population (&quot;Volksverhetzung&quot;) (§ 130)

In 2002 German public prosecutors were empowered to prosecute crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide internationally under the &quot;Völkerstrafgesetzbuch&quot; (&quot;Code of Crimes against international Law&quot;). Another special penal code is the &quot;Wehrstrafgesetz&quot; to prosecute special crimes within military service such as insubordination (§20 WStG) and desertion (§16 WStG).

== Structure ==

The German Penal Code is divided into two main parts:

General Part (&quot;Allgemeiner Teil&quot;): in which general issues are arranged, for example:
* Area of the law&#x27;s validity
* Law-related definitions
* Capacity to be adjudged guilty
* Perpetration and incitement or accessoryship
* Necessary defence
* General provisions for punishments (fines and imprisonment)
* Statutes of limitations
* Attempts
* Competition

Special Part (&quot;Besonderer Teil&quot;): in which the different criminal offences and their definitions and punishments are listed, for example:
* Crimes against the democratic rule of law
* Crimes against public order
* Crimes against the person of a sexual nature
* Crimes against life
* Crimes against another person&#x27;s wealth (for example robbery and theft)

==Notable sections==
These sections differ significantly from the criminal codes in other countries, and/or are relevant for topics discussed in other articles.

===§ 86a: Use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations===

Outlaws the distribution or public use of symbols of unconstitutional groups, in particular, flags, insignia, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. The laws ban most Nazi insignia from any usage for propagating the ideology outside artistic, scientific, research, or opposition uses (swastikas, SS sig runes, Totenkopf, Othala rune, the neo-Nazi version of the Celtic Cross, the swastikas versions of the Iron Cross and Reichsadler, Wolfsangel, the party and Reichkriegsflagge Nazi flags, the Sturmabteilung emblem, the Nazi salute and the greetings &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; or &quot;Sieg Heil&quot;, are outlawed under the law) it also extends to bans on symbols of the Communist Party of Germany (Hammer and sickle, red star and red flag are under it), ISIS Black Standard, and Kurdish People&#x27;s Protection Units (YPG) pennant.

This section has been the basis for the confiscation of video games like &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; or &quot;Mortyr&quot; and the censorship of Nazi symbolism in World War II-related media until August 2018.

===§ 103: Insulting of organs and representatives of foreign states (repealed)===
Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan himself made a complaint in 2016 against German satirist Jan Böhmermann as a private person because of an alleged insult. The Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, Numan Kurtulmuş, called the poem a &quot;serious crime against humanity&quot;.

On 1 June 2017 the German &quot;Bundestag&quot; decided by a unanimous vote to repeal this section. This decision went into effect on 1 January 2018.

===§ 130: Sedition ===
Section 3 outlaws denying the genocide committed under the rule of National Socialism (1933–1945). Section 4 prohibits glorifying or approving the reign of the Nazis.

===§ 130: Incitement to hatred (Volksverhetzung) ===
Section 130 makes it a crime to:

* incite hatred against segments of the population or call for violent or arbitrary measures against them in a manner capable of disturbing the peace
* to insult, maliciously malign, or defame segments of the population in a manner capable of disturbing the peace
* disseminate, publicly make accessible, produce, obtain, supply, stock, offer, announce, commend, undertake to import or export, or facilitate such use by another of written materials that assaults the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously maligning or defaming segments of the population or a previously indicated group
* approve of, deny or downplay an act committed under the rule of National Socialism in a manner capable of disturbing the peace
This section is often applied to trials related to Holocaust denial.

===§ 131: Representation of violence (Gewaltdarstellung)===
Outlaws the dissemination or public display of media &quot;which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human or humanoid beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity&quot;.

This section was used as the legal basis for confiscating some horror movies and a few video games such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, &quot;Manhunt&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

===§ 140: Rewarding and approving crimes===
Outlaws rewarding or approving of crimes &quot;publicly, in a meeting or through dissemination of writings […], and in a manner that is capable of disturbing the public peace&quot;. This only applies to crimes where failure to report is an offense (§ 138), among them preparation of a war of aggression (§ 80), murder, robbery, treason, and counterfeiting money.

This section formed the grounds for the lawsuit against Holger Voss.

===§ 175: Homosexual acts between men (repealed)===

This section, which was in force in some form or other from 1871 to 1994, criminalized sexual acts between males under circumstances that varied as the law was modified over the years. Acts between consenting adults, if not done in the context of prostitution, were excluded from prosecution in 1969. Until 1969 the section also criminalized sexual acts between humans and animals. No corresponding legislation against lesbian sex acts existed.

===§ 202c: Preparation of data espionage or data interception===

Highly controversial, it outlaws the preparation of an act of data espionage (§ 202a) or data interception (§ 202b) by making, obtaining, selling, distributing (or otherwise committing or making accessible to others)
# passwords or security codes to access data, or
# computer programs whose purpose is to commit such an act.

As the definition of a &quot;program with the purpose of committing data espionage or data interception&quot; is quite vague, there is a lot of debate how this new prohibition is to be handled in court, since software essential to system or network security might be seen to fall under this act as well. Too extensive an interpretation will surely collide with the freedom of exercise of occupation as well as the right to property (Articles 12 and 14 of the Basic Law).

===§ 211: Murder (under aggravating circumstances)===

In German: &quot;Mord&quot;. The intentional, successful killing of another person, with at least one of the aggravating circumstances mentioned in § 211 sec.2 fulfilled. Those circumstances concern base motives, criminal aims or cruel ways of committing the crime. An intentional killing that does not qualify for &quot;Mord&quot; is called &quot;Totschlag&quot; (§ 212). § 211 is the only crime within the &quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot; that carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (a sentence of life without parole is not expressly provided for in German law, but it is possible certain convicts of murder can spend the rest of their lives in prison).

===§ 218: Abortion===
Regulating abortion, in combination with § 218a. Revised several times, with a 1974 liberalization declared unconstitutional by the courts, and historically very controversial. After a multi-partisan compromise was reached during the early 1990s, it permits abortion during the first trimester, upon condition of mandatory counseling and a waiting period, and in rare exceptional cases afterwards. After this compromise was found, there has been relatively little further controversy about the section.

===§ 219a: Ban on advertising for abortions===

Paragraph 219a forbade medical professionals from providing information about any abortion services they offered. The law was enacted in 1933, months after the Nazi party had come to power. It was repealed in 2022.

===§ 323c: Duty to Rescue===

This section requires everybody to &quot;render assistance during accidents or a common danger or emergency&quot; if necessary, as far as can be expected (&quot;under the circumstances, particularly if it is possible without substantial danger to himself and without violation of other important duties&quot;). Refusing to assist can be punished with up to one year of imprisonment. As a consequence, should an attempt at first aid prove unsuccessful or actually harmful, it will not be prosecuted (Good Samaritan law). Note that while the duty, in itself, only exists so far as one is actually capable of providing aid, having passed a course in first aid is required for a driving license, and thus on this level is expected from all motorised traffic participants.

<text>Telepolis is a German Internet magazine, published by the Heinz Heise Verlag since the beginning of 1996.

It was founded by journalists Armin Medosch and Florian Rötzer and deals with privacy, science, culture, internet-related and general politics and media. Other contributors include Mathias Bröckers, Gabriele Hooffacker or Burkhard Schröder.

&quot;Telepolis&quot; received the European prize for online journalism in the category &quot;investigative reporting&quot; in 2000 for its coverage of the Echelon project; in 2002, it received the Online Grimme prize.

It periodically releases special issues, the first printed edition (January 2005) being on &quot;Aliens - how researchers and space travellers want to uncover their presence.&quot; One of the articles in this edition, perhaps the most daring, described the so-called theory of everything (TOE) proposed by Burkhard Heim and its alleged applications to spacecraft propulsion. (Heim theory is not part of mainstream physics, and few physicists would describe it as a TOE.) Others deal with SETI and exobiology.

== Criticism ==
&quot;Telepolis&quot; presents contemporary historical topics differing from the so-called mainstream media. Two days after the Terror attacks on 11 September 2001, Mathias Bröckers speculated in an article on &quot;Telepolis&quot; that the Bush administration had deliberately allowed the attacks to happen. Over time, this one article became a conspiracy series that made Bröckers a star of the Truther scene and to him by Wolfgang Wippermann Antisemitism accusations.

In their 2017 essay &quot;Lügenpresse - Eine Verschwörungstheorie?&quot;, Uwe Krüger and Jens Seiffert-Brockmann discuss counter-publics and alternative media that are anchored in various milieus and ideological orientations. During the Russo-Ukrainian War, they examined Telepolis, among others, and found that this medium emphasised information from a left-wing perspective that was negative towards the pro-Western actors and questioned the narrative of the democratic revolution. What such media have in common is &quot;that they work on perforating the established media reality, questioning the established mass media definitions of reality, declaring reference frames and axioms of the mainstream invalid and exchanging them.&quot; The liberal, pluralistic democracy is portrayed as an opinion dictatorship based on a conspiracy between ruling elites and the established media.

In 2019, the Americanist and conspiracy theory researcher Michael Butter placed &quot;Telepolis&quot; among the alternative media such as &quot;KenFM&quot;, &quot;NachDenkSeiten&quot; or &quot;Rubikon,&quot; all of which would form an alternative public sphere to the traditional mass media and public broadcasting. According to Butter, they serve conspiracy theorys such as that of the lying press and sell them as serious news.

<text>t-online.de is a German news portal, owned and published by digital multi-channel media company Ströer. It reaches over 179 million visits per month coming from 29 million unique visitors. The editorial team is located in Berlin.

==History==

In 1995 Deutsche Telekom renamed the &quot;Bildschirmtext&quot; (BTX) service as &quot;T-Online&quot;. In Spring 2000, T-Online became the first major ISP in Germany to offer a flat-rate dialup plan for consumers. This was important because local telephone calls in Germany, including dialup access to ISPs, were not offered on a flat price per call (i.e., unlimited) basis. The flat-rate service was also offered to customers with ISDN connections at the same price as for analog service. In spring 2001, T-Online announced the demise of the flat-rate dialup plan but offered a flat-rate DSL plan in its place.

Deutsche Telekom (T-Online) was the monopoly Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the German Internet until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter. Until the 21st century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet access by individuals and small businesses in Germany.

The website t-online.de was taken over by digital multi-channel media company Ströer in 2015. In addition to acquiring a major news site, the synergy enables Ströer to publish T-Online editorial content via a network of public video screens in shopping malls as well as train and subway stations.

<doc id="717626" wikidata="Q1366519" url="?curid=717626" title="Hamline University">
<text>Hamline University ( ) is a private university in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1854, Hamline is the oldest university in Minnesota, the first coeducational university in the state, and is one of five Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities. The university is named after Bishop Leonidas Lent Hamline of the United Methodist Church. As of 2017, Hamline had 2,117 undergraduate students and 1,668 graduate students.
In 2022, the university attracted widespread criticism after firing an adjunct professor for showing paintings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in a class on the history of Islamic art.

==History==
===Red Wing location (1854–1869)===
Hamline was named in honor of Leonidas Lent Hamline, a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church whose interest in the frontier led him to donate $25,000 toward the building of an institution of higher learning in what was then the territory of Minnesota. Today, a statue of Bishop Hamline sculpted by the late professor of art Michael Price stands on campus. Founded as a coeducational institution, Hamline was among the first coeducational universities in the United States. Hamline&#x27;s first home was in Red Wing, Minnesota. The school&#x27;s charter stipulated Hamline be located &quot;at some point on the Mississippi between St. Paul and Lake Pepin.&quot; The city of Red Wing pledged about $10,000 to enable construction of a building and the beginning of an endowment, and donated a tract of land on a hillside overlooking the Mississippi River.

Chartered in 1854, Hamline University is the oldest university in Minnesota, and the first coeducational university in the state, graduating its first collegiate class in 1859.

The first classes at Hamline were held in rooms housed on the second floor of the village general store while the construction of the classroom building was in progress. Students moved into the Red Wing building in January 1856. The original building contained a chapel, recitation rooms, a school room, a library, laboratory, reading rooms, and dormitory quarters. Seventy-three students enrolled at Hamline in the opening year. The catalog lists them separately as &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen,&quot; but most of them were children or adolescents. All were enrolled in either the primary or the preparatory department. There was no collegiate division—the frontier had not yet produced students ready for college. Tuition ranged from $4.00 to $6.66 per term.

With the start of the American Civil War, enrollment in the college division dropped from 60 to 16 in one year. There was no graduating class in 1862. Records indicate that 119 Hamline men served in the Union armies during the war. In 1869, the university shut down. The first building at the Red Wing site was torn down in 1872.

===Saint Paul campus (1880–1914)===
It had been expected that Hamline would reopen on a new site within two years after the closing at Red Wing; however, indecision in the selection of a new site caused a delay. In the end, a Saint Paul prairie plot halfway between the downtowns of Minneapolis and Saint Paul was selected. Construction began in 1873, but by then an economic depression had overtaken the planners, and there were repeated postponements and delays. University Hall, begun in 1873, was constructed in installments, and was completed during the summer of 1880.

The doors opened on September 22, 1880, and Hamline&#x27;s history in Saint Paul began. The catalog for that year lists 113 students, with all but five of them being preparatory students. Tuition in the collegiate division was $30 per year. Two degrees were offered at the time: the B.A. and the B.S. In 1883, the bachelor of philosophy degree replaced the B.S., and remained in use until 1914, when the faculty dropped the PhB. and restored the B.S. degree.

On February 7, 1883, University Hall, barely two years old, burned to the ground. To replace the structure, plans for a new University Hall were prepared. Eleven months later, the new structure, the present Old Main, was completed. Emergency space for classrooms was provided by Ladies&#x27; Hall, which had opened in 1882. Other new construction included Science Hall, which was completed in 1887, the Carnegie library in 1907, and the new gymnasium, which was completed in 1909.

===World War I and postwar years (1915–1929)===
When World War I came in April 1917, track and baseball schedules for spring were cancelled as enlistments and applications of officers&#x27; training depleted the teams. Hamline was designated one of 38 colleges in the country to supply men for ambulance work in France. Twenty-six men were selected for the unit and served in France with the 28th Division of the French Army. Ambulance work during World War I involved great personal danger and took great expertise to stay alive. Three former students of Hamline University, Wallace Ramstad, Glen Donaldson, and Walter Gammel died in battle. One of the more notable situations the Hamline ambulance unit, otherwise known as Section 568, was involved in was the fighting in the Meuse-Argonne territory, which lasted 47 days. During the war, Section 568 retained the banner that students from Hamline had sewn for them before their training. At the end of the war Section 568 received the Croix de Guerre from the French government for their service. In the fall of 1918, a unit of the Students&#x27; Army Training Corps was established at Hamline, and almost every male student became an enlisted member. The Science Hall was used for military purposes, with the basement becoming the mess hall and the museum and several classrooms being marked for squad rooms and sleeping quarters.

===The Great Depression and World War II (1930–1945)===
The Great Depression and World War II created significant challenges for Hamline. The most difficult were the years in the early 1930s, in which the repercussions of the depression were intensified by conflicts over internal reorganization. Increased enrollments reflected the belief that it was better for students to be in college than to be sitting at home in idleness and despair. The college tried to help, providing jobs and financial aid, and lowering tuition. Jobs of any kind were at a premium, with the most prized being board jobs in the Manor House and at the Quality Tea Room on Snelling Avenue. Also in top demand were board and room jobs for women in private homes. In the meantime, the portion of the college endowment invested in farmlands turned unproductive, and the university&#x27;s income fell following reductions in tuition. All of this led to annual deficits and substantial cuts in faculty salaries.

It was not until 1935 that Hamline began to recover from the depression. During the war years, Hamline&#x27;s enrollment held above 600, except in 1943 and 1944. Although males registrations dropped as men entered the armed services, women&#x27;s enrollment increased as nursing students arrived.
Hamline and the Asbury Methodist Hospital of Minneapolis launched a new venture in 1940 when they collaboratively established the Hamline-Asbury School of Nursing, which offered a five-year program leading to a Bachelor of Science in nursing. Hamline moved with a growing trend to provide academic training for women preparing for careers in nursing. A three-year program leading to a diploma in nursing was also offered. In 1949, the Mounds-Midway School of Nursing joined the school, and the newly enlarged institution took the name of the Hamline University School of Nursing.

===Post World War II (1946–1966)===
A flood of veterans entered or returned to college after World War II under the G.I. Bill of Rights. The first reached the campus in the fall of 1946, when registrations passed 1,000 for the first time. Enrollment reached a new high in 1949 when 1,452 students, including 289 in the nursing school. The nursing school, which had been an integral part of Hamline since 1940 and had won wide recognition for the excellence of its program, was discontinued in 1962 following a decision to concentrate resources and staff on liberal arts programs. The last class in the three-year program graduated in 1960 and the last class in the degree program graduated in 1962. A total of 447 women completed the degree program, and 758 women finished the three-year program.

After World War II, two new residence halls were built—Drew Residence for men and Sorin Hall for women. A new fine arts center was completed in 1950, and the Drew Hall of Science was dedicated in 1952. The old science building was taken over by the social science and other departments and was renamed Social Science Hall. In 1963, the A.G. Bush Student Center was completed and became the social, recreational, and cultural center of the campus. Throughout this period, buildings were enlarged or remodeled to keep pace with new needs and standards. Wings were added to the Manor House and Drew Residence. The seating capacity of the library was increased to 100 with the completion of a new periodical room, and the old student union was remodeled and turned into a laboratory with classrooms and office space for the language departments. In the summer of 1966, extensive alterations and improvements were made in Hutton Arena and in the theater of the fine arts center.

Between 1953 and 1966, faculty members received grants totaling more than $600,000 for education and research programs.

===New academic publications (1966–1987)===
Hamline broke ground in May 1970 for the $2.6 million Bush Memorial Library. The library, a three-story, building housing some 240,000 volumes, opened in the fall of 1971. The Paul Giddens Alumni Learning Center, linked to the Carnegie library and named for a former university president, opened in October 1972. The social science and humanities divisions and the department of education are now housed within the center, which also contains classrooms, study areas, and laboratories.

The university began construction on a new $4 million law school building in January 1979, which was dedicated in October 1980. The Hamline University School of Law received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1975. The law school began publishing the &quot;Hamline Law Review&quot; in 1978. The &quot;Hamline Law Review&quot; ceased publication in 2015 and merged with the &quot;William Mitchell Law Review&quot; to form the &quot;Mitchell Hamline Law Review&quot;.

A second student-edited journal began publication in the spring of 1980. Originally titled as the &quot;Journal of Minnesota Public Law,&quot; it became the &quot;Hamline Journal of Public Law and Policy&quot; in 1986. In 2016, this journal was combined with the &quot;William Mitchell Journal of Law and Practice&quot; to create the &quot;Mitchell Hamline Law Journal of Public Policy and Practice&quot;

In 1983, in collaboration with the Council on Religion and Law at Harvard University Divinity and Law Schools, the Hamline School of Law launched a faculty-edited journal, the Journal of Law and Religion.

After the Charles M. Drew Fine Arts Center opened in 1950, Hamline began to gradually acquire a permanent art collection, especially after Paul Smith became chair of the fine arts department in 1965. By 2003, the permanent collection included more than 600 original works.

===New construction and discoveries (1988–2003)===
The $1.3 million Sundin Music Hall opened in October 1989. The Orem Robbins Science Center was dedicated on May 9, 1991, and became the home of the biology, chemistry, and physics departments. Old Main, the campus landmark, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places; it was renovated during the summer of 1978 and again after a fire on September 2, 1985, caused $10,000 worth of damage. In October 1990, workers began a $290,000 renovation. They removed and rebuilt a section of the tower, covered the 106-year-old building with new concrete shingles, and installed a four-sided clock in the tower. In 1993, an electric carillon was added to the tower that can ring a bell and play selected music.

 Hamline broke ground on September 27, 1996, for the $5.6 million, Law and Graduate Center/Conference Center, which was dedicated on October 10, 1997. Hamline began construction on a $7.7 million student apartment building at 1470 Englewood for 142 graduate and law students on September 2, 1998. The building was completed in 2000, in time for students to move in for the fall term.
After four years of planning, ground was broken on October 18, 1996, for an $8.5 million sports, recreation, and health complex—Lloyd W. D. Walker Fieldhouse—though construction did not begin until the following spring. The completed fieldhouse, at Snelling and Taylor, opened on September 10, 1998. Klas Center, a modern, $7.1 million multi-use facility which includes the football field and a track, was built in 2003 to replace the aging Norton Field.

As the campus was transformed by construction projects, attention turned to Hamline&#x27;s roots in the summer of 1996. An archaeological dig headed by John McCarthy of the Institute of Minnesota Archaeology and anthropology professor Skip Messenger began at the site of Hamline&#x27;s original building in Red Wing. The three-story brick building, constructed in 1855 and open in time for classes to begin in January 1856, closed in 1869 and was demolished in 1871. Since few records exist from that time, the exact location and dimensions of the original building were unknown until the archaeological dig. The dig found that the original building&#x27;s foundation was insufficient for its size, leading to speculation that structural problems might have contributed to the building&#x27;s closing and eventual demolition.

===21st century controversies===
In the autumn of 2012, Hamline students and faculty protested the school&#x27;s refusal to condemn the proposed Minnesota constitutional amendment that would have banned equal marriage rights for all citizens. Hamline&#x27;s attempt to stay neutral on the issue was seen as inconsistent with the university&#x27;s anti-discrimination policy and its espoused values of diversity and inclusiveness, as well as with its United Methodist heritage and identity, since the Minnesota Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church had voted to publicly oppose the amendment. In June 2014, Hamline&#x27;s adjunct professors voted to form a union as part of the SEIU, making Hamline the first private university in Minnesota where adjunct faculty formed a union. On July 1, 2015, Fayneese Miller became the first African American to be the President of Hamline University and the second woman to hold that office.

====Teacher fired over Muhammad art====
In October 2022, a few students—led by the president of the university&#x27;s Muslim Students Association&#x27;s chapter—accused an adjunct professor of harboring &quot;Islamophobia&quot; for showing paintings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in a class on the history of Islamic art. The professor had informed the students of the nature of the images in the syllabus issued at the beginning of the semester, provided trigger warnings for days before the class, and even provided a disclaimer right before displaying the slides, allowing students to skip the particular lesson. Despite these, the students chose to attend the lesson, mainly motivated by the unusual trigger warning.

Notwithstanding an apology from the professor to the students and the entire class, the university administration declined to renew her contract and, a month later, publicly characterized her use of the paintings as &quot;undeniably inconsiderate, disrespectful, and Islamophobic&quot;, and &quot;unacceptable&quot;. In the next few days, while the Dean of Students classified the professor&#x27;s teaching as &quot;an act of intolerance&quot;, President Fayneese Miller cautioned all Hamline employees that &quot;respect for the observant Muslim students should have superseded academic freedom.&quot;

Academics criticized Hamline&#x27;s approach to academic freedom and their understanding of Islam as a monolith which was uniformly condemning the paintings, ignoring that Muslim rulers commissioned them; art historians characterized the paintings to be an indispensable component of any lesson on Islamic art history. Free speech groups have taken a similar stance—PEN America labeled the termination as &quot;one of the most egregious violations of academic freedom in recent memory.&quot; Scholars have also highlighted how the increasing commercialization of higher education with little security for adjunct faculties allowed for such firings. In addition, prominent Muslim advocacy organizations, including the Council on American–Islamic Relations and the Muslim Public Affairs Council, issued statements rejecting charges of Islamophobia against the professor.

In January 2023, the professor sued the university for religious discrimination and defamation; shortly after, President Miller withdrew her accusations of Islamophobia and acknowledged error in subordinating academic freedom to mainstream Islamic norms. A week later, most of the university&#x27;s tenured faculty requested Miller&#x27;s resignation. In April, Miller announced her intent to retire in June 2024.

==Schools and colleges==

===College of Liberal Arts===
The College of Liberal Arts houses Hamline&#x27;s undergraduate programs. College of Liberal Arts students can earn a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in 41 areas of study. Hamline is one of 276 Phi Beta Kappa institutions in the country. Students may also minor in 38 areas of study within the college. All students complete an internship, collaborative research, a service learning project, or field-based research.

The undergraduate student to faculty ratio is 12:1 and the median class size is 18. Almost all (94%) faculty hold the highest degree in their fields.

Hamline competes in 20 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division III Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. In addition to sports, Hamline has more than 70 clubs and organizations. Hamline also has an alliance with Hamline Elementary School, which is a public elementary located across the street from the university.

===School of Education===
Hamline University&#x27;s School of Education houses graduate and undergraduate programs. For undergraduates, Hamline students pursue a BA or BS degree in the liberal arts, combined with a co-major in education and a Minnesota teaching license. Hamline has six graduate programs in education, including a doctorate in education, and professional development opportunities for educators than any other private institution in Minnesota.

The school offers the following programs:
* Co-Major in Education

==Student life==
Hamline students have the opportunity to partake in various on-campus activities. All clubs, intramural teams, and student events are run through the Student Affairs Division. Hamline&#x27;s clubs include organizations with focuses on various academic subjects, the arts, journalism, culture, advocacy/social justice, recreation, and spirituality. Hamline also has two Greek organizations: Delta Tau sorority and Theta Chi fraternity, both of which are located a block west of campus. The two largest on-campus organizations are the Hamline Undergraduate Student Congress (HUSC) and Hamline University Programming Board (HUPB).

HUSC is the governing body of the undergraduate students, with the stated purpose of providing an organized medium for expressing student concerns to the administration. It is also responsible for overseeing and funding the majority of student organizations on campus. HUPB plans student events, such as the homecoming dance, End of the Semester Party, and the annual lip sync contest.

===Residence halls and dining===

Drew Hall houses 200 undergraduate men and women. The hall is staffed by resident advisors on each floor, an assistant hall director and one area coordinator. Drew was built in 1946 as a men&#x27;s residence after a donation by Charles M. Drew.
Manor Hall is the oldest dormitory on the campus. It was built in 1922 as a women&#x27;s dormitory, although today it is co-ed. Manor is home to second-, third- and fourth-year undergraduates.

Sorin Hall was built in 1958 and houses just over 100 men and women on single-gender floors, including two female floors and one male floor.

Osborn, Peterson and Schilling Residence Halls collectively known as the Heights, are identical buildings built in the late 1960s. Each houses nearly 100 first-year men and women.

The primary dining hall is located in The Carol Young Anderson and Dennis L. Anderson Center, often referred to as Anderson. The facility is operated by a private food management firm, ARAMARK. The dining hall is all-you-can-eat, charging a flat rate for entry, regardless of how much food is consumed. Meal plans are available for students. Included in the purchase of a meal plan is a certain amount of money that can be used at other facilities on campus (&quot;declining balance&quot; dollars). This money can be spent by using the student ID card like a debit card.

===Newspaper and other publications===
Hamline&#x27;s student newspaper is &quot;The Oracle&quot;. It was founded in 1888 and has been published regularly ever since. The paper began as a monthly journal of letters and evolved into a weekly college newspaper. &quot;The Oracle&quot; receives its funding from and is published by the Student Media Board, which serves as an umbrella organization for the &quot;Liner&quot;, the university&#x27;s yearbook, the &quot;Fulcrum&quot;, the university&#x27;s literary magazine, and Hamline University Radio.

==Athletics==

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
Hamline University is regarded as the &quot;birthplace of intercollegiate basketball&quot; and home to the first recorded basketball game played between two colleges. In 1894, then-athletic director (and student) Ray Kaighn, who had played on James Naismith&#x27;s first basketball team, brought the sport to the university after Naismith devised rules for the game in December 1891. A women&#x27;s program was organized the next year. On February 9, 1895, Hamline hosted the first intercollegiate basketball game in history, when the Minnesota State School of Agriculture (now the St. Paul campus of the University of Minnesota) defeated Hamline by a score of 9–3. The game was played in the basement of the university&#x27;s old science building using Naismith&#x27;s original &quot;peach basket&quot; rules, and featured nine players to each side.

Hamline was once known for the strength of its basketball program, with the university considered to be a national power in the sport from the 1930s to the 1950s. Hamline produced a number of NBA players during this time, including Hall of Famer Vern Mikkelsen. Then-head coach Joe Hutton Sr. (1931–1965) was once offered and turned down a chance to coach the Minneapolis Lakers, though his son later played for the team.

Hutton Arena, the home court for the Piper basketball and volleyball teams, was built in 1937. Originally named Norton Field House, it was renamed after Hutton. A statue of the coach is in the lobby of the building.

Hamline appeared in the NAIA national tournament 12 times from 1940 to 1960 Hamline is one of 3 schools to place 4th (1940) 3rd (1948) 2nd (1953) and 1st (1942,1949,1951).

<doc id="717634" wikidata="Q4137694" url="?curid=717634" title="Heterophenomenology">
<text>In the thought of the philosopher Daniel Dennett, heterophenomenology (&quot;phenomenology &quot;of another&quot;, not oneself&quot;) is an explicitly third-person, scientific approach to the study of consciousness and other mental phenomena. It consists of applying the scientific method with an anthropological bent, combining the subject&#x27;s self-reports with all other available evidence to determine their mental state. The goal is to discover how subjects see the world themselves, without taking the accuracy of the subject&#x27;s view for granted.

==Overview==
Heterophenomenology is put forth as the alternative to traditional Cartesian phenomenology, which Dennett calls &quot;lone-wolf autophenomenology&quot; to emphasize the fact that traditional phenomenology accepts the subject&#x27;s self-reports as being authoritative. In contrast, heterophenomenology considers the subjects authoritative only about how things &quot;seem&quot; to them. It does not dismiss the Cartesian first-person perspective, but rather brackets it so that it can be intersubjectively verified by empirical means, allowing it to be submitted as scientific evidence.

The method requires a researcher to listen to the subjects and take what they say seriously, but to also look at everything else available to them, including the subject&#x27;s bodily responses and environment, evidence provided by relevant neurological or psychological studies, the researcher&#x27;s memories of their own experiences, and any other scientific data that might help to interpret what the subject has reported.

Dennett notes this method is actually the normal way that anyone will choose to investigate aspects of the mind. He writes: &quot;heterophenomenology is nothing new; it is nothing other than the method that has been used by psychophysicists, cognitive psychologists, clinical neuropsychologists, and just about everybody who has ever purported to study human consciousness in a serious, scientific way&quot;.

The key role of heterophenomenology in Dennett&#x27;s philosophy of consciousness is that it defines all that can or needs to be known about the mind. For any phenomenological question &quot;why do I experience X&quot;, there is a corresponding heterophenomenological question &quot;why does the subject say &#x27;I experience X&#x27;&quot;. To quote Dennett, &quot;The total set of details of heterophenomenology, plus all the data we can gather about concurrent events in the brains of subjects and in the surrounding environment, comprise the total data set for a theory of human consciousness. It leaves out no objective phenomena and no subjective phenomena of consciousness.&quot;

<doc id="717639" wikidata="Q7557990" url="?curid=717639" title="Illinois Solidarity Party">
<text>The Illinois Solidarity Party was an American political party in the state of Illinois. It was named after Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s Solidarity movement in Poland, which was then widely admired in Illinois, which has a very large Polish-American population, especially around Chicago.

The party was founded in 1986 by Senator Adlai Stevenson III in reaction to the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination of two followers of Lyndon LaRouche in the race for high state offices: Mark Fairchild, who was running for Lieutenant Governor, and Janice Hart, who was running for Illinois Secretary of State. Stevenson, a Democratic candidate for Illinois Governor, did not want to run alongside anybody associated with LaRouche&#x27;s organization.

There are a number of explanations as to how LaRouche&#x27;s followers became nominees. Some believe that it simply boiled down to the names of the LaRouche candidates, which sounded less &quot;ethnic&quot; than those of their opponents, George E. Sangmeister and Aurelia Pucinski. Hart&#x27;s victory over Pucinski was likely helped by a voter reaction to Pucinski, whose father, Roman Pucinski, was a prominent opponent of Chicago Mayor Harold Washington.

Many criticized the Democrats for their failure to inform voters exactly who the candidates were, which allowed campaigning efforts in rural areas to be very effective. &quot;LaRouche Democrats&quot; claimed that the Democratic Party, especially Chairman Charles Manatt, was under the influence of the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. LaRouche maintained that the population voted for his followers to take the party back from elitist bankers.

In any case, most analysts, including Stevenson himself, agreed that the whole ordeal confused voters and helped the Republican Party&#x27;s James R. Thompson win the election.

The &quot;Solidarity Democrats&quot; and the LaRouche supporters blamed one another for the subsequent years of Republican control in Illinois state government. Stevenson left politics and went on to become an investment banker.

The Solidarity Party continued to exist, completely unaffiliated with Stevenson, after the 1986 incident. In the 1987 Chicago mayoral election, Edward Vrdolyak ran for Mayor of Chicago on the Illinois Solidarity Party ticket, which provided the major opposition to incumbent Harold Washington, Chicago&#x27;s first African-American mayor, losing to Washington by a final tally of 53%–43%.

Its continued existence afterward made it an easy target for other small political parties to &quot;take over&quot; whenever necessary. One such group was the New Alliance Party (NAP), which was largely unknown in Illinois but still managed to run some of its candidates for local offices. The NAP founder Lenora Fulani campaigned as a Solidarity Party presidential candidate in 1988 and 1992.

<text>Patricia Ann Moss-Carlsson (&quot;née&quot; Moss; 27 December 1934 – 14 October 2008) was one of the most successful female auto rally drivers of all time, achieving three outright wins and seven podium finishes in international rallies. She was crowned European Ladies&#x27; Rally Champion five times (1958, 1960, 1962, 1964–65). Her older brother Stirling Moss was a Formula One Grand Prix star during the 1950s. From 1963 until her death in 2008, Swedish rally driver Erik Carlsson was both her driving-partner and her husband.

She is the author of a memoir &quot;The Story So Far&quot; (1967) and, with her husband, co-author of &quot;The Art and Technique of Driving&quot; (1965).

==Biography==
Pat Moss was born in Thames Ditton, Surrey, England, to British race car driver Alfred Moss and Aileen (née Craufurd). She grew up in Bray, Berkshire and was taught to drive at the age of 11 by her brother, Stirling. But she started her sporting career on horseback, becoming well known as a successful show-jumper and member of the British showjumping team. In 1953, aged 18, she started driving in club rallies after being introduced to the sport by boyfriend Ken Gregory, Stirling&#x27;s manager. In 1954, Moss bought a Triumph TR2 and started rallying more seriously. She asked Standard-Triumph to cover her expenses to drive her TR2 on the 1955 RAC Rally, but they declined.

A more astute MG Cars offered Moss expenses and a works MG TF 1500. Thus began a relationship lasting seven years, netting three championships and benefiting the British Motor Corporation with valuable publicity. As a BMC works team driver, Moss had her breakthrough in 1958, when she drove her Morris Minor to 4th place on the RAC Rally. She achieved another 4th place at Belgium&#x27;s Liège–Rome–Liège Rally in an Austin-Healey 100/6 and won the first of her five European Ladies&#x27; Rally Championships.

In 1960, Moss took over-all victory at the Liège–Rome–Liège in an Austin-Healey 3000 and went on to finish 2nd at the &quot;Coupe des Alpes&quot;. In 1961, she finished 2nd at the RAC Rally. In 1962, she was 3rd at the East African Safari Rally in a Saab 96 and, at the RAC, with the Austin-Healey. Her biggest achievement, however, was winning the Netherlands&#x27; Tulip Rally in a Mini Cooper, which Moss considered &quot;twitchy, and pretty unruly on the limit&quot;.

In 1963, Moss joined Ford of Britain and managed a 6th place at the Acropolis Rally in her Lotus-tuned Ford Cortina. On 9 July 1963 she married fellow rally driver Erik Carlsson. Ford tried to sign Erik; instead, in 1964, Moss switched to Saab works team to partner her husband. Together, they competed in 11 international rallies. Her most notable results were 3rd at the Acropolis Rally and 4th at the Liège–Sofia–Liège and the RAC Rally. At the Monte Carlo Rally, she came in 5th in 1964 and 3rd in 1965.

In 1968, Moss joined Lancia to drive the new Fulvia. She did not like the car&#x27;s strong understeer, but drove it to 14th place at the Monte Carlo Rally and 2nd place at the Rallye Sanremo, losing to Pauli Toivonen in a Porsche 911. Her other notable results of the season included winning the Sestriere Rally and finishing 8th at the Acropolis and 7th at the &quot;Tour de Corse&quot;. At the 1969 Monte Carlo Rally, Moss drove her Fulvia to 6th place.

In December 1969, Moss and Carlsson had a daughter, Susan. By that time, Moss was becoming less active in rallying; she joined Renault Alpine and drove her Alpine A110 to 10th place at the 1972 Monte Carlo Rally before finally retiring in 1974.

On 14 October 2008, Moss-Carlsson died of cancer, aged 73, at home in Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire. She was survived by her husband Erik and daughter Susan.

<doc id="717671" wikidata="Q517410" url="?curid=717671" title="Query string">
<text>A query string is a part of a uniform resource locator (URL) that assigns values to specified parameters. A query string commonly includes fields added to a base URL by a Web browser or other client application, for example as part of an HTML document, choosing the appearance of a page, or jumping to positions in multimedia content.

A web server can handle a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request either by reading a file from its file system based on the URL path or by handling the request using logic that is specific to the type of resource. In cases where special logic is invoked, the query string will be available to that logic for use in its processing, along with the path component of the URL.

== Structure ==
A typical URL containing a query string is as follows:

When a server receives a request for such a page, it may run a program, passing the query string, which in this case is codice_1, unchanged to the program. The question mark is used as a separator, and is not part of the query string.

Web frameworks may provide methods for parsing multiple parameters in the query string, separated by some delimiter. In the example URL below, multiple query parameters are separated by the ampersand, &quot;codice_2&quot;:

The exact structure of the query string is not standardized. Methods used to parse the query string may differ between websites.

A link in a web page may have a URL that contains a query string. HTML defines three ways a user agent can generate the query string:
* an HTML form via the element
* a server-side image map via the attribute on the element with an construction
* an indexed search via the now deprecated element

=== Web forms ===
One of the original uses was to contain the content of an HTML form, also known as web form. In particular, when a form containing the fields codice_3, codice_4, codice_5 is submitted, the content of the fields is encoded as a query string as follows:

* The query string is composed of a series of field-value pairs.
* Within each pair, the field name and value are separated by an equals sign, &quot;codice_6&quot;.
* The series of pairs is separated by the ampersand, &quot;codice_2&quot; (semicolons &quot;codice_8&quot; are not recommended by the W3C anymore, see below).

While there is no definitive standard, most web frameworks allow multiple values to be associated with a single field (e.g. codice_9).

For each field of the form, the query string contains a pair codice_10. Web forms may include fields that are not visible to the user; these fields are included in the query string when the form is submitted.

This convention is a W3C recommendation. In the recommendations of 1999, W3C recommended that all web servers support semicolon separators in addition to ampersand separators to allow application/x-www-form-urlencoded query strings in URLs within HTML documents without having to entity escape ampersands. Since 2014, W3C recommends to use only ampersand as query separator.

The form content is only encoded in the URL&#x27;s query string when the form submission method is GET. The same encoding is used by default when the submission method is POST, but the result is submitted as the HTTP request body rather than being included in a modified URL.

=== Indexed search ===
Before forms were added to HTML, browsers rendered the – element as a single-line text-input control. The text entered into this control was sent to the server as a query string addition to a GET request for the base URL or another URL specified by the attribute. This was intended to allow web servers to use the provided text as query criteria so they could return a list of matching pages.

When the text input into the indexed search control is submitted, it is encoded as a query string as follows:

* The query string is composed of a series of arguments by parsing the text into words at the spaces.
* The series is separated by the plus sign, &#x27;codice_11&#x27;.

Though the element is deprecated and most browsers no longer support or render it, there are still some vestiges of indexed search in existence. For example, this is the source of the special handling of plus sign, &#x27;codice_11&#x27; within browser URL percent encoding (which today, with the deprecation of indexed search, is all but redundant with codice_13). Also some web servers supporting CGI (e.g., Apache) will process the query string into command line arguments if it does not contain an equals sign, &#x27;codice_6&#x27; (as per section 4.4 of CGI 1.1). Some CGI scripts still depend on and use this historic behavior for URLs embedded in HTML.

== URL encoding ==
Some characters cannot be part of a URL (for example, the space) and some other characters have a special meaning in a URL: for example, the character codice_15 can be used to further specify a subsection (or fragment) of a document. In HTML forms, the character codice_6 is used to separate a name from a value. The URI generic syntax uses URL encoding to deal with this problem, while HTML forms make some additional substitutions rather than applying percent encoding for all such characters. SPACE is encoded as &#x27;codice_11&#x27; or &quot;codice_13&quot;.

HTML 5 specifies the following transformation for submitting HTML forms with the &quot;GET&quot; method to a web server. The following is a brief summary of the algorithm:
* Characters that cannot be converted to the correct charset are replaced with HTML numeric character references
* SPACE is encoded as &#x27;codice_11&#x27; or &#x27;codice_13&#x27;
* Letters (codice_21–codice_22 and codice_23–codice_24), numbers (codice_25–codice_26) and the characters &#x27;codice_27&#x27;,&#x27;codice_28&#x27;,&#x27;codice_29&#x27; and &#x27;codice_30&#x27; are left as-is
* codice_11 is encoded by %2B
* All other characters are encoded as a codice_32 hexadecimal representation with any non-ASCII characters first encoded as UTF-8 (or other specified encoding)

The octet corresponding to the tilde (&quot;codice_27&quot;) is permitted in query strings by RFC3986 but required to be percent-encoded in HTML forms to &quot;codice_34&quot;.

The encoding of SPACE as &#x27;codice_11&#x27; and the selection of &quot;as-is&quot; characters distinguishes this encoding from RFC 3986.

== Example ==
If a form is embedded in an HTML page as follows:

&lt;form action=&quot;/cgi-bin/test.cgi&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;first&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;second&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
and the user inserts the strings &quot;this is a field&quot; and &quot;was it clear (already)?&quot; in the two text fields and presses the submit button, the program codice_36 (the program specified by the codice_37 attribute of the codice_38 element in the above example) will receive the following query string:
codice_39.

If the form is processed on the server by a CGI script, the script may typically receive the query string as an environment variable named codice_40.

== Tracking ==
A program receiving a query string can ignore part or all of it. If the requested URL corresponds to a file and not to a program, the whole query string is ignored. However, regardless of whether the query string is used or not, the whole URL including it is stored in the server log files.

These facts allow query strings to be used to track users in a manner similar to that provided by HTTP cookies. For this to work, every time the user downloads a page, a unique identifier must be chosen and added as a query string to the URLs of all links the page contains. As soon as the user follows one of these links, the corresponding URL is requested to the server. This way, the download of this page is linked with the previous one.

For example, when a web page containing the following is requested:

 &lt;a href=&quot;foo.html&quot;&gt;see my page!&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;bar.html&quot;&gt;mine is better&lt;/a&gt;
a unique string, such as codice_41 is chosen, and the page is modified as follows:

 &lt;a href=&quot;foo.html?e0a72cb2a2c7&quot;&gt;see my page!&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;bar.html?e0a72cb2a2c7&quot;&gt;mine is better&lt;/a&gt;
The addition of the query string does not change the way the page is shown to the user. When the user follows, for example, the first link, the browser requests the page codice_42 to the server, which ignores what follows codice_43 and sends the page codice_44 as expected, adding the query string to its links as well.

This way, any subsequent page request from this user will carry the same query string codice_41, making it possible to establish that all these pages have been viewed by the same user. Query strings are often used in association with web beacons.

The main differences between query strings used for tracking and HTTP cookies are that:
# Query strings form part of the URL, and are therefore included if the user saves or sends the URL to another user; cookies can be maintained across browsing sessions, but are not saved or sent with the URL.
# If the user arrives at the same web server by two (or more) independent paths, it will be assigned two different query strings, while the stored cookies are the same.
# The user can disable cookies, in which case using cookies for tracking does not work. However, using query strings for tracking should work in all situations.
# Different query strings passed by different visits to the page will mean that the pages are never served from the browser (or proxy, if present) cache thereby increasing the load on the web server and slowing down the user experience.

== Compatibility issues ==
According to the HTTP specification:
Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.

If the URL is too long, the web server fails with the 414 Request-URI Too Long HTTP status code.

The common workaround for these problems is to use POST instead of GET and store the parameters in the request body. The length limits on request bodies are typically much higher than those on URL length. For example, the limit on POST size, by default, is 2 MB on IIS 4.0 and 128 KB on IIS 5.0. The limit is configurable on Apache2 using the codice_46 directive, which specifies the number of bytes from 0 (meaning unlimited) to 2147483647 (2 GB) that are allowed in a request body.

<text>Salamanes Hermias Sozomenos (; ; c. 400 – c. 450 AD), also known as Sozomen, was a Roman lawyer and historian of the Christian Church.

== Family and home ==
He was born around 400 in Bethelia, a small town near Gaza, into a wealthy Christian family of Palestine.

He told the history of Southern Palestine derived from oral tradition. He appeared to be familiar with the region around Gaza, and mentioned having seen Bishop Zeno of Majuma, at the seaport of Gaza.

=== Grandfather ===
Sozomen wrote that his grandfather lived at Bethelia, near Gaza, and became a Christian together with his household, probably under Constantius II. A neighbor named Alaphrion was miraculously healed by Saint Hilarion, who cast out a demon from Alaphrion, and, as eyewitnesses to the miracle, his family converted, along with Alaphrion&#x27;s. The conversion marked a turning-point in the Christianization of southern Palestine, according to his account.

The grandfather became within his own circle a highly esteemed interpreter of Scripture and according to Sozomen &quot;much beloved by the Christians of Ascalon, Gaza and of the surrounding country&quot;. The descendants of the wealthy Alaphrion founded churches and convents in the district, and were particularly active in promoting monasticism and were also esteemed by Sozomen. Sozomen himself had conversed with one of these, a very old man. He states that he was brought up under monastic influences and his story bears this out.

== Life and career ==
=== Education ===
Sozomen seems to have been brought up in the circle of Alaphrion and acknowledges a debt of gratitude to the monastic order. His early education was directed by the monks in his native place. It is impossible to ascertain what curriculum he followed in these monastic schools, but his writings give clear evidence of the thoroughness with which he was grounded in Greek studies.

As a man he retained the impressions of his youth, and his great work later was to be also a monument of his reverence for the monks in general and for the disciples of Hilarion in particular.

Sozomen studied at the Law school of Berytus between 400-402.

=== Lawyer ===
As an adult he acquired training as a lawyer. He studied law in Beirut. He then went to Constantinople to start his career as a lawyer, perhaps at the court of Theodosius II. While thus engaged he conceived, around the year 443 the project of writing a history of the Church.

== Writings on Church history ==
Sozomen wrote two works on church history, of which only the second one is extant.

His first work covered the history of the Church, from the Ascension of Jesus to the defeat of Licinius in 323, in twelve books. His sources for it included Eusebius of Caesarea, the Clementine homilies, Hegesippus, and Sextus Julius Africanus.

Sozomen&#x27;s second work continues approximately where his first work left off. He wrote it in Constantinople, around the years 440 to 443 and dedicated it to Emperor Theodosius II.

The work is structured into nine books, roughly arranged along the reigns of Roman Emperors:
* Book I: from the conversion of Constantine I until the Council of Nicea (312–325)
* Book II: from the Council of Nicea to Constantine&#x27;s death (325–337)
* Book III: from the death of Constantine I to the death of Constans I (337–350)
* Book IV: from the death of Constans I to the death of Constantius II (350–361)
* Book V: from the death of Constantius II to the death of Julian the Apostate (361–363)
* Book VI: from the death of Julian to the death of Valens (363–375)
* Book VII: from the death of Valens to the death of Theodosius I (375–395)
* Book VIII: from the death of Theodosius I to the death of Arcadius (395–408).
* Book IX: from the death of Arcadius to the accession of Valentinian III (408–25).

Book IX is incomplete. In his dedication of the work, he states that he intended cover up to the 17th consulate of Theodosius II, that is, to 439. The extant history ends about 425. Scholars disagree on why the end is missing. Albert Guldenpenning supposed that Sozomen himself suppressed the end of his work because in it he mentioned the Empress Aelia Eudocia, who later fell into disgrace through her supposed adultery. However, it appears that Nicephorus, Theophanes, and Theodorus Lector actually read the end of Sozomen&#x27;s work, according to their own histories later. Therefore, most scholars believe that the work actually came down to that year and that consequently it has reached us only in a damaged condition.

=== Other writings ===
According to historian and scholar of Islam Michael Cook, Sozomen wrote that a group of &quot;Saracens&quot; (Arabs) in Palestine had adopted Jewish laws and customs after coming into contact with Jews and may have been (according to Cook) the forerunners of Islam and Muslims.

=== Sources ===
Sozomen borrowed heavily from other sources for his work.

The source for about three fourths of his material was the writings of Socrates Scholasticus. The literary relationship of those writers appears everywhere. Valesius asserted that Sozomen read Socrates, and Robert Hussey and Guldenpenning have proved this. For example, Socrates, in I.x, relates an anecdote which he had heard, and says that neither Eusebius nor any other author reports it, yet this anecdote is found in Sozomen, I.xxii, the similarity of diction showing that the text of Socrates was the source.

The extent of this dependence cannot be accurately determined. Sozomen used the work of Socrates as a guide to sources and order. In some matters, such as in regard to the Novatians, Sozomen is entirely dependent on Socrates.

But Sozomen did not simply copy Socrates. He went back to the principal sources used by Socrates and other sources, often including more from them than Socrates did.

He used the writings of Eusebius, the first major Church historian. The &quot;Vita Constantini&quot; of Eusebius is expressly cited in the description of the vision of Constantine.

Sozomen appears also to have consulted the &quot;Historia Athanasii&quot; and also the works of Athanasius including the &quot;Vita Antonii&quot;. He completes the statements of Socrates from the &quot;Apologia contra Arianos&quot;, lix, sqq., and copies Athanasius&#x27; &quot;Adv. episcopos AEgypti&quot;, xviii-xix.

Rufinus is frequently used. Instructive in this respect is a comparison of Sozomen, Socrates, and Rufinus on the childhood of Athanasius. Rufinus is the original; Socrates expressly states that he follows Rufinus, while Sozomen knows Socrates&#x27; version, but is not satisfied with it and follows Rufinus more closely.

The ecclesiastical records used by Sozomen are principally taken from Sabinus, to whom he continually refers. In this way he uses records of the synods from that of Tyre (335) to that of Antioch in Caria (367).

For the period from Theodosius I, Sozomen stopped following the work of Socrates and followed Olympiodorus of Thebes, who was probably Sozomen&#x27;s only secular source. A comparison with Zosimus, who also made use of Olympiodorus, seems to show that the whole ninth book of Sozomen, is mostly an abridged extract from Olympiodorus.

Sozomen used many other authorities. These include sources relating to Christianity in Persia, monkish histories, the &quot;Vita Martini&quot; of Sulpicius Severus, the works of Hilarius, &quot;logoi&quot; of Eustathius of Antioch, the letter of Cyril of Jerusalem to Constantius concerning the miraculous vision of the cross, and Palladius.

He also used oral tradition, adding some of the most distinctive value to his work.

=== Publication ===
The first printed (though untranslated) version of Sozomen, which was based on the &quot;Codex Regius&quot; of 1444, was that of Robert Estienne at Paris in 1544. The first translated edition to be published was that of Christophorson, which appeared in Latin in Geneva in 1612. 

A noteworthy edition was done by Valesius (Cambridge, 1720), who used, besides the text of Stephens, a &quot;Codex Fucetianus&quot; (now at Paris, 1445), &quot;Readings&quot; of Savilius, and the indirect traditions of Theodorus Lector and of Cassiodorus-Epiphanius.

Hussey&#x27;s posthumous edition (largely prepared for the press by John Barrow, who wrote the preface) is important, since in it the archetype of the &quot;Codex Regius&quot;, the &quot;Codex Baroccianus&quot; 142, is collated for the first time. But this manuscript was written by various hands and at various times and therefore is not equally authoritative in all its parts.

There is an excellent English translation published in 1846 (London, Samuel Bagster and sons), translator unnamed, later reprinted and credited to Chester David Hartranft (1839-1914), with a learned though somewhat diffuse introduction, in the &quot;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers&quot;, II (published New York, 1890).

<doc id="717686" wikidata="Q16833892" url="?curid=717686" title="Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley">
<text>Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley (c. 1460 – 31 January 1531) was an English nobleman created a Knight of the Garter (KG) in the beginning of King Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. He was chamberlain to Princess Mary (later Queen Mary I) from 1525 to 1528.

==Early life==
Edward Sutton was the eldest son of Sir Edmund Sutton and Joyce de Tiptoft, daughter of Sir John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft. In right of his wife Joyce, Edmund Dudley benefited from her inheritance of the Tibetot barony and Cherleton barony, and thus co-heir to the Powis inheritance, but was never created baron of these holdings.

Through his uncle, John Sutton Dudley, Knt. of Atherington, his first cousin was Edmund Dudley (Henry VII&#x27;s minister), who was the father of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland. Another uncle was William Dudley, Bishop of Durham. 

His aunt, Eleanor Dudley, married Sir Henry Beaumont of Wednesbury, and George Stanley, of West Bromwich and High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1473.

The book &quot;A Declaration Made by the Prynce of Conde&quot; (1662) was published in his name by the publishing opperarion of Geneva Bible publisher Sir Rowland Hill

==Peerage==
In 1487, upon the death of his grandfather, John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley, he inherited the barony of Dudley, which had been created for him in 1440, ten years after he had served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

==Personal life==
Edward married Cecily Willoughby, daughter of Sir William Willoughby and Joan Strangeways, and granddaughter of Katherine Neville, Duchess of Norfolk, by whom he had:

# John Sutton, 3rd Baron Dudley, his successor.
# Hon. Geoffrey Sutton, who married Eleanor Talbot, by whom he was the father of Thomas Sutton of Russels.
# Hon. Thomas Sutton.
# Hon. Arthur Sutton, prebendary in Lichfield Cathedral (see Chad of Mercia).
# Hon. Elizabeth Sutton, who married Thomas Butler, son of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond.
# Hon. Alice Dudley [Sutton].

<text>Eustathius of Antioch, sometimes surnamed &quot;the Great&quot;, was a Christian patriarch of Antioch in the 4th century. His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is 21 February.

== Life ==
He was a native of Side in Pamphylia. About 320 he was bishop of Beroea, and he became patriarch of Antioch shortly before the Council of Nicaea in 325. In that assembly he distinguished himself zealously against the Arians, though the &quot;Allocutio ad Imperatorem&quot; with which he has been credited is probably not by him. At Nicaea, he and Marcellus joined forces with Alexander. In this way, they were able to significantly influence the formulation of the Nicene Creed.

His anti-Arian polemic against Eusebius of Nicomedia made him unpopular among his fellow bishops in the East, and a synod convened at Antioch in 330 deposed him for Sabellianism, which was confirmed by the emperor.

After Nicaea, the conflict at Nicaea between the Eusebians and the pro-Nicenes continued. &quot;Within ten years of the Council of Nicaea all the leading supporters of the creed of that Council had been deposed or disgraced or exiled&quot;, including Eustathius. Arius and his theology were now no longer the focus of the Controversy. The focus of the controversy was now the term homoousios:

* The Eusebians, led by Eusebius of Caesarea, argued that this term implies Sabellianism, in which the Logos is part of the Father and has no real distinct existence;
* Eustathius accused Eusebius, an admirer of Origen, for deviating from the Nicene Creed:

&quot;The fifth-century ecclesiastical historian Sozomen reports a dispute immediately after the council, focused not on Arius, but [...] concerning the precise meaning of the term &quot;homoousios&quot;. Some thought this term [...] implied the non-existence of the Son of God; and that it involved the error of Montanus and Sabellius. [...] Eustathius accused Eusebius [of Caesarea] of altering the doctrines ratified by the council of Nicaea, while the latter declared that he approved of all the Nicaean doctrines, and reproached Eustathius for cleaving to the heresy of Sabellius&quot;.

Eustathius was accused, condemned, and deposed at a synod in Antioch. His supporters at Antioch rebelled against the decision of this synod and were ready to take up arms in his defence. But Eustathius kept them in check, exhorted them to remain true to their faith and humbly left for his place of exile, accompanied by a large body of his clergy. Eustathius was banished to Trajanopolis in Thrace, where he died, probably about 337, though possibly not until 370. The Eusebians proposed Eusebius as the new bishop, but he declined. 

When, after the death of Eustathius, Meletius became Bishop of Antioch in 360, the Eustathians would not recognise him, even after his election was approved by the Synod of Alexandria in 362. Their intransigent attitude gave rise to two factions among the orthodox, the so-called Meletian Schism, which lasted till the second decade of the fifth century.

&quot;The schism at Antioch, between the Eustathians, or old Catholic party, under their Bishop Paulinus [...] and the new Catholic party under Meletius, had troubled both the East and West. The holiest Bishops in the East, such as Basil and Eusebius of Samosata, sided with Meletius. Damasus and the Western Bishops communicated with Paulinus. Meletius asserted Three Hypostases in the HOLY TRINITY, Paulinus I: Damasus would not allow the former, for fear of being considered an Arian, nor Basil the latter, lest he should be imagined a Sabellian. [...] Peter served as a kind of connection between the two conflicting parties, though his sentiments inclined to those of Damasus. Basil addressed a letter to him while at Rome, on the subject, in which he complains in very strong language, that the Western Bishops, who could not be so well acquainted with the actual state of affairs, should presume to class Meletius and Eusebius among the Arians&quot;.

The only complete work by Eustathius is the &quot;De Engastrimytho contra Origenem&quot;.

The Commentary on the Hexameron attributed to him in the manuscripts is too late to be authentic.

<doc id="717701" wikidata="Q5419187" url="?curid=717701" title="Ex parte Endo">
<text>Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944), was a United States Supreme Court &quot;ex parte&quot; decision handed down on December 18, 1944, in which the Court unanimously ruled that the U.S. government could not continue to detain a citizen who was &quot;concededly loyal&quot; to the United States. Although the Court did not touch on the constitutionality of the exclusion of people of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast, which it had found not to violate citizens&#x27; rights in the &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; decision on the same date, the &quot;Endo&quot; ruling nonetheless led to the reopening of the West Coast to Japanese Americans after their incarceration in camps across the U.S. interior during World War II.

The Court also found as part of this decision that if Congress is found to have ratified by appropriation any part of an executive agency program, the bill doing so must include a specific item referring to that portion of the program.

==Background==
The plaintiff in the case, Mitsuye Endo, had worked as a clerk for the California Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento before World War II. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had soured public sentiment toward Japanese Americans, Endo and other Nisei state employees were harassed and eventually fired because of their Japanese ancestry. Civil rights attorney and president of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), Saburo Kido, working with San Francisco attorney James Purcell, began a legal campaign to assist these workers, but the mass removal authorized by Executive Order 9066 complicated their case. Endo was selected as a test case to file a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; because of her profile as an Americanized, &quot;assimilated&quot; Nisei. She was a practicing Christian, had never been to Japan, spoke only English and no Japanese, and had a brother in the U.S. Army.

On July 13, 1942, Purcell filed the &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition for Endo&#x27;s release from the Tule Lake camp, where she and her family were being held. Judge Michael J. Roche heard Endo&#x27;s case in July 1942 but did not issue a ruling until July 1943, when he denied her petition without explanation. An appeal was perfected to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in August 1943, and in April 1944, Judge William Denman sent the case to the Supreme Court, rather than issuing a ruling himself. By then, Endo had been transferred to Topaz, Utah—Tule Lake having been converted to a segregated detention center for &quot;disloyal&quot; Japanese American inmates.

In an effort to halt her case, the War Relocation Authority had offered to release her if she agreed not to return to the West Coast, but Endo refused and so remained in confinement.

==&quot;Endo&quot;, &quot;Korematsu&quot;, and end of internment==
The unanimous opinion ruling in Endo&#x27;s favor was written by Justice William O. Douglas, with Justices Frank Murphy and Owen Roberts concurring. It stopped short of addressing the question of the government&#x27;s right to exclude citizens based on military necessity but instead focused on the actions of the WRA: &quot;In reaching that conclusion [that Endo should be freed] we do not come to the underlying constitutional issues which have been argued... [W]e conclude that, whatever power the War Relocation Authority may have to detain other classes of citizens, it has no authority to subject citizens who are concededly loyal to its leave procedure.&quot;

Because of that avoidance, it is very difficult to reconcile &quot;Endo&quot; with &quot;Korematsu&quot;, which was decided the same day. As Justice Roberts pointed out in his &quot;Korematsu&quot; dissent, distinguishing the cases required a reliance on the legal fiction that &quot;Korematsu&quot; dealt with only the exclusion of Japanese Americans, not their detention, and that Fred Korematsu could have gone anywhere else in the United States, when in reality he would have been subject to the detainment found illegal in &quot;Endo&quot;. In short, &quot;Endo&quot; determined that a citizen could not be imprisoned if the government was unable to prove disloyalty, but &quot;Korematsu&quot; allowed the government a loophole to punish that citizen criminally for refusing to be illegally imprisoned. Roberts also criticized the Court&#x27;s majority for blaming the Army and failing to hold the president accountable. The executive branch, he pointed out, “not only was aware of what was being done but in fact that which was 
done was formulated in regulations and in a so-called handbook open to 
the public.” He called it “inadmissible to suggest that some inferior public servant exceeded the authority granted by executive order in this case.&quot;

The Roosevelt administration, having been alerted to the Court&#x27;s decision, issued Public Proclamation No. 21 the day before the &quot;Endo&quot; and &quot;Korematsu&quot; rulings were made public, on December 17, 1944. It rescinded the exclusion orders and declared that Japanese Americans could begin returning to the West Coast in January 1945.

<text>Edelmiro Julián Farrell Plaul (; 12 February 1887 – 21 October 1980) was an Argentine general. He was the &quot;de facto&quot; president of Argentina between 1944 and 1946.

Farrell had a great influence on later Argentine history by introducing his assistant Juan Perón into government and paving the way for Perón&#x27;s subsequent political career.

==Early life==
He was born in 1887 in Villa de los Industriales (Lanús, Buenos Aires). He was the tenth son of Juan C. Farrell (1846–1887) and Catalina Plaul (1852–1917) and the grandson of Matthew Farrell (1803–1860) of County Longford, which was the family seat of the Farrell clan in Ireland as Lords of Annaly, and Mónica Ibáñez (1819–1867).

==Military career==
Farrell graduated from Argentine military school in 1907 as an infantry sub-lieutenant. He served in an Italian alpine regiment in Fascist Italy between 1924 and 1926. He then returned to Argentina. 

After the 1943 coup, Farrell was promoted to brigadier general and became vice-president during the military government of General Pedro Pablo Ramírez, who had deposed President Arturo Rawson. He was simultaneously Minister of War. Farrell appointed Juan Perón as his secretary.

==President==
Ramírez named Farrell as president on 25 February 1944. Farrell appointed Perón as vice-president. After popular demonstrations in favour of Perón in 1945 made Perón the most influential and important man in the government, Farrell announced presidential elections for 1946, and Perón was elected. On 4 June 1946, Farrell was succeeded as president by Perón. Farrell had been his commander while Perón was a colonel.

Farrell declared war on Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan on 27 March 1945 towards the end of World War II after pressure to get Argentina as part of the Allies after the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace.

==Family==
He married on 10 July 1921, to Conrada Victoria Torni (1 January 1895 – 16 August 1977), a teacher. They had three children: Nelly Victoria (born 1923), Jorge Edelmiro (1925–1950), and Susana Mabel (born 1930).

==Death==
A widower, he died in Buenos Aires in 1980.

==In popular culture==
Farrell, in the movie &quot;Evita&quot;, is portrayed by British actor Denis Lill.

<doc id="717720" wikidata="Q5335867" url="?curid=717720" title="Eddie Braben">
<text>Edwin Charles Braben (31 October 1930 – 21 May 2013) was an English comedy writer and performer best known for providing material for Morecambe and Wise. He also worked for David Frost, Ronnie Corbett and Ken Dodd.

==Life and career==
Braben&#x27;s father was a butcher at St. John&#x27;s Market, Liverpool, and he was born in Monkswell Street, Dingle. He was evacuated to Anglesey as a child during World War II, and was a fan of radio comedy, particularly Arthur Askey. He left school in 1945 and worked in the British American Tobacco factory before national service in the Royal Air Force, during which he was posted to the kitchen at RAF Kenley. He then worked as a market trader with his own greengrocery stall, writing jokes in his spare time.

Although shy, he sent jokes to various comedians that were appearing in Liverpool. His first was sold to Charlie Chester for 2s 6d (12½p), but his first major success was with Ken Dodd, with whom he worked for 12 years.

Braben&#x27;s biggest success came when the BBC lured Morecambe and Wise from ITV. Bill Cotton, then in charge of Light Entertainment at the BBC, was looking for a writer following the duo&#x27;s split from Dick Hills and Sid Green. The first Braben-penned &quot;Morecambe &amp; Wise Show&quot; was broadcast in July 1969, and he wrote most of their BBC shows after that, including many of the Christmas specials. In 1980, he joined Thames Television to continue writing for the duo following their move back to ITV two years previously.

Braben, along with Morecambe and Wise, won the Society of Film Television Artists 1973 award for Outstanding Contribution to Television. He also won the Best British Light Entertainment Script award from the Writer&#x27;s Guild of Great Britain in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1973.

Braben wrote and appeared in various radio comedy shows for the BBC, including &quot;The Worst Show on the Wireless&quot; (Radio 2; 1973–75) and &quot;The Show with Ten Legs&quot; (Radio 2; 1976–81). In 2001, Braben collaborated with Hamish McColl and Sean Foley to write &quot;The Play What I Wrote&quot;, a stage play and tribute to Morecambe and Wise, which opened at the Liverpool Playhouse Theatre before transferring to London&#x27;s West End. The play won an Olivier Award for Best New Comedy, it later transferred to Broadway and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Special Theatrical Event. The director was Kenneth Branagh.

Braben had a son, Graham, with his first wife. After her death, he married Deidree, an ex George Mitchell singer/dancer, with whom he had two daughters. He had six grandchildren.

Braben&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Book What I Wrote&quot;, was published in 2004.

Braben&#x27;s book, &quot;Eddie Braben&#x27;s Morecambe and Wise Book,&quot; was published shortly after his death in 2013.

In December 2017, &quot;Eric, Ernie and Me&quot;, a docudrama about Braben&#x27;s work with Morecambe and Wise written by Neil Forsyth starring Stephen Tompkinson as Eddie Braben, was shown on BBC Four.

<text>Pedro Pablo Ramírez Menchaca (30 January 1884 – 12 May 1962) was President of Argentina from 7 June 1943, to 24 February 1944. He was the founder and leader of &quot;Guardia Nacional&quot;, Argentina&#x27;s fascist militia.

==Life and career==
After graduating from the Argentine military college in 1904 as a second lieutenant, Ramírez was promoted in 1910 as first lieutenant of the cavalry. In 1911, he was sent to Germany for training with the Fifth Hussars cavalry in Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s Prussian Army. He returned home in 1913, with a German wife, prior to the outbreak of World War I. Advancing in rank as a specialist in cavalry tactics, he assisted fellow General José Félix Uriburu in an authoritarian coup that deposed Hipólito Yrigoyen in 1930. Ramírez was sent to Rome to observe Mussolini&#x27;s army until his return in 1932.

When Uriburu set free elections and then died, General Ramírez worked behind the scenes to plan a return of fascism to Argentina. Over the next several years, he organized the Milicia Nacionalista (later the Guardia), and authored a program for a state ruled by the militia. In 1942, Ramírez was appointed War Minister by President Ramón Castillo, and began to reorganize the Argentine Army. At the same time, the Guardia Nacional joined with another party to form &quot;Recuperacion Nacional,&quot; a fascist political party. Castillo fired Ramírez following a cabinet meeting on 18 May 1943. Two weeks later, on 4 June 1943, Ramírez assisted Arturo Rawson in overthrowing Castillo&#x27;s government, and was again made Minister of War. Three days later, on 7 June Ramírez forced Rawson&#x27;s resignation and maintained Argentina&#x27;s neutrality during World War II. Because of this, the United States refused Argentine requests for Lend-Lease aid. Argentina finally declared war on Germany and Japan during the government of Edelmiro Farrell.

Despite having been brought to power through a coup d&#x27;état, Peronist historiography never calls him a dictator.

==In popular culture==
*Ramírez makes a brief appearance in the film &quot;Evita&quot; during the song &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Got Potential&quot;, which depicts Juan Perón&#x27;s rise to power. Here he is depicted as a very elderly man, played by Héctor Malamud.

<text>Ramón Antonio Castillo Barrionuevo (November 20, 1873 – October 12, 1944) was President of Argentina from 1942 to 1943. He took office after the resignation of President Roberto María Ortiz, under whom he had served as the Vice President. He was a leading figure in the period known as the Infamous Decade, characterised by electoral fraud, corruption, and rule by conservative landowners heading the alliance known as the &quot;Concordancia&quot;.

Castillo graduated in law from the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and began a judicial career. He reached the Appeals Chamber of commercial law before retiring and dedicating himself to teaching. He was professor and dean at UBA between 1923 and 1928.

Castillo was named Federal Intervenor of Tucumán Province in 1930. From 1932 until 1935, he was elected to the Argentine Senate for Catamarca Province for the National Democratic Party and was also Minister of Interior.

From 1938 to 1942, Castillo was vice-president of Argentina under President Roberto Ortiz, who won the election by fraud as the head of the &quot;Concordancia&quot;. He served as acting president from July 3, 1940 to June 27, 1942 due to the illness of President Ortiz, who did not resign until less than a month before his death. Castillo maintained Argentina&#x27;s neutrality during World War II. He was overthrown in the Revolution of &#x27;43 military coup in the midst of an unpopular attempt to impose Robustiano Patrón Costas as his successor. Future president Juan Domingo Perón was a junior officer in the coup.

<doc id="717748" wikidata="Q948191" url="?curid=717748" title="John Chandos">
<text>Sir John Chandos, Viscount of Saint-Sauveur in the Cotentin, Constable of Aquitaine, Seneschal of Poitou, (c. 1320 – 31 December 1369) was a medieval English knight who hailed from Radbourne Hall, Derbyshire. Chandos was a close friend of Edward the Black Prince and a founding member and 19th Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. Chandos was a gentleman by birth, but unlike most commanders of the day he held no inherited title of nobility.

Described by the medieval historian Froissart as &quot;wise and full of devices&quot;, as a military strategist Chandos is believed to have been the mastermind behind three of the most important English victories of the Hundred Years War: the Battle of Crécy, the Battle of Poitiers and the Battle of Auray. His death in a minor skirmish was regretted by both sides.

==Origins==
Born to an obscure family of landed gentry, Chandos was the son and heir of Sir Edward Chandos, the lord of the manor of Radbourne, Derbyshire. Inevitably, he trained in the arts of war and distinguished himself as a young knight.

==Military career==
According to the chronicles of Henry Knighton, on the eve of the Battle of Sluys, Edward III anchored his fleet at Blankenberge and sent ashore Chandos with Sir Reginald Cobham and Sir Stephen Lambkin to reconnoitre the French fleet. They found that the enemy vessels were ranged in three compact lines and included the captured English prize, the great cog &quot;Christopher&quot;; the ships were crammed together tightly and anchored at the entrance of the Zwin (also: Zwyn) channel.

Chandos was a leading figure at the Battle of Crécy. As Chief of Staff to Edward, the Black Prince, he designed the strategy that won victory at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356.

In 1360, Chandos was created a knight banneret, which allowed him to hold a banner in battle. This came of being made the Viscount of Saint-Sauveur by Edward III. This is contrary to the Life of the Black Prince, written by the Herald of John Chandos which suggested that Chandos was made a banneret immediately before the Battle of Najera in 1367. Nevertheless, on that occasion, Edward, the Black Prince of Wales, and Aquitaine at that time, merely unfurled the banner for Chandos as a mark of respect.

On 29 September 1364, Chandos led the forces of Duke John de Montfort to victory at the Battle of Auray, winning the Breton War of Succession and enabling de Montfort to become John IV, Duke of Brittany.

In reward for his service, Chandos was created the lieutenant of France, the vice-chamberlain of England and was given the viscounty of Saint-Sauveur in the Cotentin. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, he became constable of Aquitaine. Later, however, after disagreeing with Edward over how the Guyennois should be taxed, he retired to his property in Normandy.

===Death===
In 1369, the French launched a successful counterattack, regaining much territory and forcing Edward to recall Chandos, who was appointed seneschal of Poitou and settled in Poitiers. Sir John attempted to deal with the French attempts to regain a foothold in the province. The Bretons John Kerlouët and Louis de Saint Julien Trimouille, lord of Lusignan, had occupied La Roche-Posay and Saint-Savin, a few miles from Poitiers. Chandos decided to retake the abbey of Saint-Savin, with a surprise attack under cover of night.

The planned attack failed when, thinking they had been detected by the enemy, Chandos&#x27; force retreated towards the bridge across the Vienne at Lussac-les-Châteaux, along the route to Poitiers through Chauvigny. The French, actually unaware of their presence, had decided to follow the same route to harass any English troops. The adversaries met at the bridge of Lussac. In the battle, Chandos&#x27; long coat made him slip on the frost. James de Saint-Martin, a squire in the house of Sir Bagnac (or Guillaume Boitel, according to Paul Hay du Chastelet) struck Chandos with his lance, piercing his face below the eye. Chandos&#x27; uncle Edward Twyford, standing over his wounded nephew, repulsed the attackers. One of his squires pierced both legs of James Saint-Martin with his sword; Saint-Martin died three days later at Poitiers. John Chandos was carried on a large shield to Morthemer, the nearest English fortress. He died in the night, either on 31 December or the early hours of 1 January 1370, after a day and night of agony, at the age of around 50.

==Legacy==
When the news of Sir John&#x27;s death reached the court of Edward III in England, and that of the Black Prince at Guyenne, they were greatly upset. Chandos was not only a great warrior but also an able administrator and a wise politician.

A cenotaph of John Chandos was erected shortly after his death by the English authorities to commemorate the spot where he fell. The cenotaph is still maintained and visible in a garden along the street Jean Chandos at a place called &quot;Les Aubeniaux&quot; (commune of Mazerolles (Vienne department). At the end of the 19th century, the local society of history moved it some yards away from the border of the Vienne because of the river&#x27;s recurrent flooding.

His passing was mourned on both sides. In his book &quot;A Brief History of The Hundred Years&#x27; War&quot;, Desmond Seward states that Charles V of France (&quot;Charles the Wise&quot;) is reported to have said that &quot;had Chandos lived, he would have found a way of making a lasting peace&quot;. Froissart is more circumspect, but says that &quot;I have heard him at the time regretted by renowned knights in France; for they said it was a great pity he was slain, and that, if he could have been taken prisoner, he was so wise and full of devices, he would have found some means of establishing a peace between France and England&quot;. He also stated of Chandos that &quot;never since a hundred years did there exist among the English one more courteous, nor fuller of every virtue and good quality than him.&quot;

==Chandos Herald==
John Chandos&#x27; herald, known as Chandos Herald, wrote a significant poem entitled, &quot;The Life of the Black Prince&quot;. The poem details many of the Prince&#x27;s exploits in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, including the Castilian civil war, the battle of Crecy, and the battle of Poitiers (though these last two only briefly).

==Cultural influence==
John Chandos is one of the characters in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The White Company&quot; (1892) and in his later novel &quot;Sir Nigel&quot;.

John Chandos appears as a character in the video game &quot;Bladestorm: The Hundred Year War&quot;, in which he is seen as the right-hand guardian of Edward, the Black Prince. He also appears in the &quot;Dragon Knight&quot; series of writer Gordon R. Dickson as a protagonist of Baron Sir James Eckert.

John Chandos appears in TOMMY Ohtsuka&#x27;s manga &quot;Hawkwood&quot; as Edward the Black Prince&#x27;s mentor.

<doc id="717754" wikidata="Q365369" url="?curid=717754" title="Roberto María Ortiz">
<text>Jaime Gerardo Roberto Marcelino María Ortiz Lizardi (24 September 1886 – 15 July 1942) was President of Argentina from 1938 until his resignation in 1942. He became president in 1938 following the 1937 presidential election, described as being among the most fraudulent in Argentine history. His main management objective was to end fraud. The attempt to normalize the institutions confronted him with his vice president, Ramón Castillo, leader of the conservative sectors of the government coalition. The president and vice president belonged to different political groupings. Ortiz was a radical antipersonnel and Castillo, a conservative in the National Democratic Party. Both were part of the formula of Concordancia, a coalition that had ruled since 1932.

==Life==
Ortiz was born in Buenos Aires on 24 September 1886. As a student at the University of Buenos Aires, he participated in the unsuccessful Argentine Revolution of 1905. In 1909 he graduated from the university and became a lawyer.

He became active in the Radical Civic Union and was elected to the Argentine National Congress in 1920. He served as Minister of Public Works from 1925 to 1928. He supported the Revolution of 1930 and served as Minister of the Treasury from 1936 to 1937. Beside his support for the coup d&#x27;état he rejected José Félix Uriburu&#x27;s attempt to create a &quot;corporatist&quot; government (inspired by Mussolini&#x27;s fascism in Italy), arguing that this model was not working in Europe.

==Presidency==
In the presidential elections of 1937, he was the official government candidate and won, though the opposition accused him of participating in fraud, as irregularities were widespread. Ortiz never denied these charges, but once he took office, he tried to make Argentine politics more open and democratic. Soon after becoming president, Ortiz became seriously ill with diabetes and on 3 July 1940, he delegated his powers to Vice President Ramón Castillo. He favored the Allies during World War II, but because of opposition within the army, he did not break relations with the Axis powers. He resigned from the presidency on 24 July 1942, three weeks before dying of bronchial pneumonia at age 55.

She is best known for her roles on daytime television soap operas, scoring parts in the serials &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; during the early stages of her career. In 1994, she stepped into the role of Sharon Newman on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, which she still plays. Case, who is considered a leading actress in the series, won the 1999 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her performance.

== Personal life ==
Case was born on February 9, 1971, in Detroit, Michigan. During her childhood, she was involved heavily in dancing, devoting herself to ballet and jazz. When she was three, Case relocated to Chatsworth, California.

She was married to businessman Sandy Corzine from April 2007 to November 2009, with the marriage ending in divorce.

In December 2001, Case became the first soap opera actress to be featured on the cover of &quot;FHM&quot;, a men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine. This issue featured multiple other daytime television actresses. Case is active on social networking website Twitter. As of May 2019, Case was in a relationship with her &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; co-star, Mark Grossman, who plays Adam Newman, one of the character&#x27;s love interests on the soap.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings ===
Although Case&#x27;s main goal was to become an actress, she turned her attention to modeling as a teenager. She stated: &quot;I thought modeling would be a good start in the business&quot;. At the age of 17 in 1988, Case caught the eye of a scout while attending a modeling event, and was offered a modeling job in Japan. She traveled to Japan for five months, before returning to Los Angeles. She later took part in theater, garnering lead role credits in the musicals &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;The Wizard&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

===Television and film===
In November 1989, Case scored her first television role playing Dawn Winthrop on the ABC Network soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Case wanted to &quot;perfect&quot; her audition prior to screen testing as Dawn, who served as the long-lost daughter of the long-running character Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson). Speaking of the audition, Case stated: &quot;I practiced night and day [...] It was a heavy scene in which Dawn learned that her boyfriend Ned (Kurt Robin McKinney) had once slept with her mother! I knew I had to do the best job [possible]&quot;. She departed &quot;General Hospital&quot; the next year, after a guest appearance on another ABC series, the comedy drama &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot;. In 1991, Case appeared in various other television series, including &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot;. From November 1992 to 1993 Case stepped into her second soap opera role, as Debbie Simon on the CBS Network drama &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Case has stated that she loved the role, and wanted to stay on to explore more into the character of Debbie who was a &quot;manic depressive&quot;, an issue that hadn&#x27;t been covered on daytime television. During this, she also appeared on the CBS crime drama &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; as Bonnie Abagail. In 1994, a year after departing from &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, she became a regular on the primetime soap opera &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, which was based on the romantic novel of the same name. In 1997, Case had a role in the HBO film &quot;Breast Men&quot;. Previously, she turned down a larger role in the film due to being uncomfortable topless on-screen. Instead, she accepted a smaller, clothed role.

In 2005, Case appeared in an independent film entitled &quot;Carpool Guy&quot; with &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; co-star Lauralee Bell. Also that year, she starred in the short film &quot;Wentworth&quot;. The film was about a man named Wentworth who had to choose between the women of his dream, Emily, and the &quot;perfect&quot; woman in his dreams, &quot;Dream&quot; Emily, both played by Case. It was directed by Steve Suettinger, and produced independently by students at the University of Southern California.

In 2007, Case starred with Debra Hopkins in her second short film, &quot;Repressions&quot;, which ran for 24 minutes. Produced by Roundhay Garden films and directed by Adam Kargman, it was filmed from May 14 to July 16, 2006. In the film, Janie (Case) is being tricked by her therapist into believing she has repressed memories of sexual child abuse. The film was met with critical acclaim from independent movie reviewers who found her performance &quot;mesmerizing&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot;. Oscar Award nominee Jesse Friedman heavily praised the film, and encouraged people to watch it. In 2009, Case appeared on an episode of the sex comedy web series &quot;Poor Paul&quot; which was created by former &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; co-star Kevin Schmidt. In June 2010, Case starred opposite David James Elliott in the romantic comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Home&quot; for the Hallmark Channel.

=== &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; ===

In August 1994, Case was cast in the role of Sharon Newman on the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. The character had been introduced by the show&#x27;s creator William J. Bell earlier that year, on March 24, 1994. The role was previously played by Monica Potter and Heidi Mark for two months each. Of her casting, Case stated: &quot;Not only is this my third soap, but I&#x27;m also the third actress to play the role of Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it.&quot; The actress wanted to &quot;breathe new life&quot; into the role and make it her own. Case was upgraded from a recurring status to a contract in early 1995. In 2001, Case revealed that she had only expected to remain on the show for six months. February 2003 saw her temporarily leave the show due to contract negotiations, with Case eventually returning that April. The character who grew up on the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot; has developed into a mother and business woman; known for her supercouple romantic pairing with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) and a &quot;darker&quot; relationship with Adam Newman (Michael Muhney).

Since 2011, the character&#x27;s storylines have been met with controversy and negative feedback. Case herself has stated that she has been unhappy with the character being paired with &quot;too many men&quot; because it &quot;waters&quot; the storyline down. A storyline in which she let her children believe she was dead was heavily frowned upon by &quot;Yahoo!&quot;. The show&#x27;s cast and viewers were appalled when Sharon was romantically paired with her former father-in-law who she had grown to have a father-daughter relationship with, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). The storyline was considered an &quot;inside joke&quot; by cast members. Case was unhappy with the romance she considered almost &quot;incestuous&quot;, stating: &quot;Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you&#x27;re bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience.&quot;

The show&#x27;s former head writer and executive producer Maria Arena Bell has been highly criticized for the &quot;destruction&quot; of Sharon. Jillian Bowe, a writer of the website Zap2It said that the character was &quot;beloved&quot; but Bell had &quot;assassinated&quot; her &quot;via one ill-conceived storyline and/or romance after another.&quot; Tommy Garrett of &quot;Canyon News&quot; praised Case, and wrote that: &quot;Maria Bell knows that consummate actress Sharon Case plays the consummate heroine Sharon Newman with aplomb.&quot; Garret also has described Case&#x27;s performance as &quot;flawless&quot; playing a &quot;role of a lifetime and giving the performance of a lifetime.&quot; Case has received several awards for her work on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. &quot;Canyon News&quot; suggested that her performance needed more Emmy attention. The character has tackled issues such as infidelity and rape, and in recent years, mental health social issues like kleptomania and most notably bipolar disorder. Case continues to play Sharon today.

==Jewelry line==
In January 2010, Case announced that she had created a signature line of fashion jewelry entitled &quot;Pomp&quot;. She created it with her best friend and fashion stylist Elif Inanc. The line was designed to have a &quot;piece for everybody&quot; which could be worn on any occasion. 20 different designs of jewelry pieces were featured in the line&#x27;s initial reveal through the shopping cable QVC Network in August 2010; prices ranged from $20–40. Nine more additional pieces were added to the &quot;Pomp&quot; jewelry line on January 15, 2011. Kim Daugherty of &quot;Yahoo!&quot; noted that &quot;they are touted to be ideal for a night on the town, giving &#x27;The Young and the Restless&#x27; fans an affordable way to sparkle and shine with star-quality by wearing star-designed jewelry&quot;. Case described the line as being affordable &quot;chic, fun and hip&quot;.

<doc id="717757" wikidata="Q2092571" url="?curid=717757" title="Stikine River">
<text>The Stikine River ( ) is a major river in northern British Columbia (BC), Canada and southeastern Alaska in the United States. It drains a large, remote upland area known as the Stikine Country east of the Coast Mountains. Flowing west and south for , it empties into various straits of the Inside Passage near Wrangell, Alaska. About 90 percent of the river&#x27;s length and 95 percent of its drainage basin are in Canada. Considered one of the last truly wild large rivers in BC, the Stikine flows through a variety of landscapes including boreal forest, steep canyons and wide glacial valleys.

Known as the &quot;fastest-flowing navigable river in North America,&quot; the Stikine forms a natural waterway from northern interior British Columbia to the Pacific coast. The river has been used for millennia by indigenous peoples including the Tlingit and Tahltan for fishing, hunting and trade. It provided access for fur traders and prospectors during the 1800s and remained an important transportation route until the 1970s, when roads were finally opened to the northern interior. However, most of the Stikine basin remains wilderness, with only a few small settlements; only two bridges, one disused, cross the river along its entire length. The river&#x27;s salmon run supports large commercial and subsistence fisheries, and its extensive estuary and delta provide habitat for numerous fish and migratory bird species.

Despite its isolation, the Stikine is a destination for recreational activities including boating, hunting and fishing. The river&#x27;s Grand Canyon, known for its dangerous rapids, has been called the &quot;K2 of white-water challenges&quot; and has only been run by a handful of expert kayakers. During the latter part of the 20th century, numerous large parks and protected areas were established in the Stikine basin, and by the beginning of the 21st century some 60 percent of the basin was under some form of conservation management. However, in recent decades the water quality and natural beauty of the Stikine have been threatened by new energy, transport and mining developments in northern BC.

==Names==
The river was known to the Tlingit as &quot;Shtax&#x27;heen&quot;, &quot;bitter river&quot; or &quot;muddy river&quot;, in reference to its murky glacial waters. The Stikine group of Tlingit, Shtaxʼhéen Ḵwáan, takes its name from the river. The Tahltan called the river &quot;Spatsizi&quot;, &quot;red goat&quot;, referring to the mountain goats whose white coats were often colored by the red earth of the region. One tributary of the upper Stikine retains the name of Spatsizi River. Another Tahltan name for the river was &quot;Tudessa&quot;, &quot;long river&quot;, from which the Tudenekoten clan of Tahltan took its name. Russian fur traders called the river &quot;ryka Stahkin&quot; (&quot;река Стакин&quot;), changed to &quot;Stikine&quot; by the United States Coast Survey in 1869 after the Alaska Purchase. Other 19th century names for the river include &quot;St. Francis River&quot; and &quot;Pelly&#x27;s River&quot;. A historic alternative spelling was &quot;Stickeen&quot;, reflected in the short-lived British Stickeen Territories.

==Geography==
The Stikine River basin covers about in the Stikine Region and Regional District of Kitimat–Stikine, BC, with a small portion in the City and Borough of Wrangell, Alaska. Most of the Stikine basin corresponds with the southern half of the Stikine Plateau, a vast and mostly forested region of dissected plateaus, rolling hills and narrow valleys in northwest BC. The Stikine Plateau is bordered on the east by the Cassiar Mountains and Omineca Mountains and on the south by the Stikine Ranges of the Skeena Mountains. All three ranges are part of BC&#x27;s Interior Mountains. To the west are the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains, which run along the U.S.–Canada border. After collecting runoff from the Stikine Plateau, the Stikine River slices west through the Coast Mountains, emptying into the Inside Passage roughly in the middle of the Alexander Archipelago, which shelters Inside Passage waterways from the Pacific Ocean.
The extensively glaciated Coast Mountains are the tallest mountains in the Stikine basin, with the highest point being Mount Ratz, above sea level. The highest points of the Stikine Plateau are generally around . The Cassiar and Omineca Mountains, rising , are also rugged but have less relief than the Coast Mountains due to their higher base elevation. The Tahltan Highland is located between the Coast Mountains and the Stikine Plateau. Drainage basins adjacent to the Stikine are the Taku River to the northwest, the Dease, Kechika and Finlay Rivers (all part of the greater Mackenzie River system) to the north and east, and the Skeena, Nass and Unuk Rivers to the south.

The Stikine basin is very sparsely populated; in 2005, the entire basin was home to about 1,300 people. The only established communities are Iskut, Telegraph Creek and Bob Quinn Lake, all in British Columbia. Dease Lake is located just outside the northern edge of the basin, near the Tanzilla River. The larger towns of Wrangell (population 2,127) and Petersburg, Alaska (3,398) are located close to the mouth of the river, but are not within the drainage basin. Forests cover about 50 percent of the basin, and most of the remainder is covered by treeless tundra or permanent ice and snow. About 73 percent of the basin in BC is considered to be in a wilderness or semi-wilderness condition.

Due to the rain shadow effect of the Coast Mountains, the interior Stikine basin has a much drier and more variable climate than the coast. Wrangell experiences a humid continental climate, with monthly average temperatures ranging from a low of in January to in July. The average annual precipitation is . Dease Lake, about northeast of Telegraph Creek, experiences a subarctic climate with monthly average temperatures ranging from in January to in June, and an average annual precipitation of just . In the interior, freezing temperatures are observed in six months of the year.

===Course===

The headwaters of the Stikine are in the Spatsizi Plateau, the southeasternmost sub-plateau of the Stikine Plateau. Originating on Mount Umbach above sea level in the Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park, it flows northeast through a chain of small lakes, including Tuaton and Laslui Lakes, then turns north, following a meandering course along the western foothills of the Omineca Mountains and the Cassiar Mountains. The river enters Stikine River Provincial Park, turning west at the confluence with the Chukachida River, then northwest at the confluence with the Spatsizi River. At the confluence with the Pitman River, it turns due west again, now flowing along the south side of the Three Sisters Range, then receives the Klappan River from the south. North of Iskut, it is crossed by BC Highway 37 (Cassiar Highway), the only road bridge across the Stikine.
Below Highway 37, the river enters the Grand Canyon of the Stikine, a deep canyon cutting between the Tanzilla and Klastline Plateaus, both sub-plateaus of the Stikine Plateau. Here, it flows much more swiftly, falling in between Highway 37 and Telegraph Creek. At one point the channel narrows from wide to just wide, a place known as the &quot;Tanzilla Slot&quot;, where it squeezes between sheer walls of volcanic rock. After receiving the Tuya and Tahltan Rivers from the north it flows through Mount Edziza Provincial Park, home to the dormant stratovolcano Mount Edziza, the central feature of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. Just downstream is Telegraph Creek, the only permanent settlement on the river. Telegraph Creek, upstream of the Stikine&#x27;s mouth, is considered the head of navigation on the Stikine.

Turning south, the Stikine flows through the Tahltan Highland along the eastern side of the Coast Mountains, where it receives numerous tributaries including the Chutine and Porcupine Rivers. The gradient flattens considerably compared to the upper course, and after the Chutine confluence it becomes wide and braided. Its course takes it around the east and south sides of the massive Stikine Icecap, the source of numerous glaciers that descend to the valley floor. John Muir, who visited the Stikine country in 1879, described the lower Stikine as &quot;a Yosemite 100 miles long&quot; due to its hundreds of glaciers and other glacially formed features. The Stikine is joined by its largest tributary, the Iskut River, from the east before passing the former border station of Stikine, BC where it enters Alaska. Turning west, the river cuts through the Coast Mountains for to the sea. In Alaska, the channel gradient is very low, with tidal influences felt up to upstream from the mouth.

The mouth of the Stikine forms a large delta opposite Mitkof Island about north of Wrangell and southeast of Petersburg. The main channel empties into the Eastern Passage at the head of Sumner Strait and Stikine Strait, while the North Arm splits off from the main channel and flows into Frederick Sound. King Slough splits southwest from the North Arm and enters Dry Strait, which connects the north end of Eastern Passage to Frederick Sound. Farm Island and Dry Island are situated between the north and main channels, with King Slough dividing the two. Due to sediment deposits from the Stikine River delta, Dry Strait is often dry at low tide and thus unsuitable for most ships using the Inside Passage. Marine traffic typically uses the Wrangell Narrows or the Chatham Strait further west.

===Discharge===
By flow volume, the Stikine is the largest river in southeast Alaska and the fifth largest river in BC. Flows of the Stikine River are affected by three main sources of runoff: snowmelt from the Stikine Plateau (peaking late spring or early summer), glacier melt from the Coast Mountains (peaking late summer), and rainfall from coastal Pacific storms (peaking autumn). The U.S. Geological Survey has operated a stream gage near the mouth of the river from 1976 to the present. The average annual discharge is with a monthly maximum of in June, and a minimum of in February. The highest annual mean was in 1981, and the lowest was in 1978. At Telegraph Creek, the average annual discharge is . The lower Stikine near the international border is generally frozen from October/November to April/May, while at Telegraph Creek, freezing occurs about a week earlier and break-up occurs one to three weeks later.

==Geology==
The Stikine basin includes several major terranes or crustal fragments that accreted to the western North American continent starting from about 180 million years ago. The Stikine Plateau roughly corresponds with the northern part of the Stikine Terrane (&quot;Stikinia&quot;), part of the larger Intermontane Belt complex. The Cassiar and Omineca Mountains to the east are formed from granite batholith remnants of an ancient continental volcanic arc (the Omineca Arc) which arose as a result of subduction following Stikinia&#x27;s collision with the North American continent. The Coast Mountains, to the west, are formed in the same manner by the later collision of the Insular Belt terrane with the Intermontane terrane. Subduction forces created the granite batholith of the Coast Range volcanic arc, which was eventually uplifted to form the contemporary Coast Mountains between the Stikine Plateau and the Pacific coast.
Despite the Coast Mountains being higher in elevation than the interior plateaus and ranges, the Stikine flows west cutting through them to reach the Pacific. Several nearby rivers including the Copper, Alsek and Taku Rivers do the same, suggesting that these river systems had been established along the west coast of the North American continent prior to the development of the Coast Range Arc. During the uplift of the Coast Mountains, the rivers maintained their courses as antecedent streams. The ancestral Stikine River may be as much as 50 million years old, with the present uplift of the Coast Mountains starting about 7 million years ago.

Beginning about 2.5 million years ago in the Pleistocene, much of the interior Stikine basin was covered by successive Ice Age glaciations. During interglacial periods, the continental ice sheet retreated northward but remnant Coast Mountain glaciers blocked the outlet of the Stikine River, causing glacier melt to back up the river valley and create Glacial Lake Stikine. The lake filled and emptied numerous times, leaving shoreline deposits high on nearby mountainsides. Glaciers and ice sheets still exist in the Stikine basin today, but to a much more limited extent. The Stikine Icecap, located in the Coast Mountains between the Stikine and Taku Rivers and the source of numerous glaciers descending to the Stikine valley, is one of the largest. Glacial activity strongly affects the geomorphology of the lower Stikine River. Due in large part to glacial silt or rock flour, the Stikine carries a heavy sediment load – some 16 million tonnes per year – continually expanding the large delta at the mouth of the river. In August 1979, a glacial lake outburst flood occurred at the Flood Glacier, releasing of water into the Stikine River, causing minor flooding as far as the mouth of the river.

The Stikine&#x27;s Grand Canyon likely formed after one such glacial period. Previously, the Stikine may have turned south around the present-day Klappan River confluence, and flowed down the valley of what is now the Iskut River. The river&#x27;s former course may have been blocked by glaciers and it was forced to cut a new path west towards present-day Telegraph Creek. Another theory is that lava flows from the Mount Edziza volcanic complex were responsible for diverting the Stikine to its new course. Pleistocene basaltic lava flows of the Klastline Formation are exposed along the Stikine River south of the Klastline River confluence for . They are believed to have originated from at least three eruptive centres on the northern and eastern sides of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.

==History and culture==
===First peoples===

The Stikine River creates one of the only natural passages through the Coast Mountains, and for thousands of years it has been used as a trade route by indigenous peoples. The river has great cultural significance for indigenous peoples; the adjacent headwaters of the Stikine, Skeena River and Nass Rivers in the Klappan Range are known to the Tahltan as &quot;Klabona&quot;, the Sacred Headwaters. The lower Stikine and Iskut rivers are home to &quot;a high number of aboriginal cultural heritage sites, including old villages, legend sites and traditional fishing areas.&quot;

Archeological sites in southeast Alaska suggest that the first humans arrived in this region about 10,000 years ago, around the end of the last glaciation, when ice dams that had previously blocked the Stikine were receding. According to Tlingit legend, their ancestors lived in the interior thousands of years ago and migrated to the coast via the Stikine River. However, a glacier (perhaps today&#x27;s Great Glacier) blocked their passage down the river. Tribal elders explored a tunnel through which the river flowed under the glacier, expecting not to return from this dangerous mission. To their surprise they discovered a way through, and their people followed to settle in southeast Alaska. Similar stories are told regarding the other rivers (Copper, Alsek and Taku) that slice through the Coast Mountains.

The Pacific coastal part of the Stikine basin is in the traditional lands of the Shtax&#x27;héen Kwáan (Stikine band of Tlingit). Formed by the unification of several smaller clans under the hereditary lineage of Chief Shakes, they controlled a large area around the mouth of the Stikine and extending well upriver. The original Shtax&#x27;héen Kwáan territory, estimated at , was the largest of any Tlingit group. The lands of the Tahltan people extended over much of the interior Stikine Plateau, including the entirety of the inland Stikine basin. Tahltan and Tlingit lands met around the confluence of the Stikine and Iskut rivers. The navigable section of Stikine between the Grand Canyon and the Iskut River was shared by the Tlingit and Tahltan on a seasonal basis. In summer, Tlingit would travel up the river to dry salmon and berries in the dry interior climate. During winter the Tahltan had exclusive use of this section, which they utilized for hunting and trapping. In the area around present-day Glenora, the Tlingit claimed use of tributaries while the Tahltan held rights to the main stem. The Tlingit also had exclusive use of certain berry patches, which were not so abundant on the coast.

The Tlingit, traveling in large dugout canoes up to in length, dominated river commerce on the Stikine. They also transported goods from other coastal tribes including the Haida and Tsimshian into the interior, where they traded with the Tahltan. The primary trading location was at the confluence of the Stikine and Tahltan rivers. Most of the Tahltan clans visited this place every year to fish and trade. From the coast, goods including eulachon, salmon oil, shells, woven baskets and blankets, as well as slaves obtained by the militaristic Haida, were ferried to the interior and exchanged for furs, caribou and moose hides, babiche, and obsidian knives and arrowheads (the latter mined from volcanic deposits around Mount Edziza). The Tahltan in turn traded coastal goods with the Kaska and Sekani further inland.

===Fur trade===

Captain George Vancouver mapped the Stikine delta in 1793 during the Vancouver Expedition, but did not realize that the river extended into the interior. In 1799, Captain Rowan in the sloop &quot;Eliza&quot; reached the Stikine delta and was the first European to record the name &quot;Stikine&quot;. In 1799 the Russian-American Company was chartered to establish new Russian settlements in North America and was granted a monopoly on the maritime fur trade in what was then Russian Alaska. The area included the mouth of the Stikine River, which became a key route for transporting furs from the interior.

During the 1800s-1860s the Tlingit controlled trade on the river, transporting Western goods upstream to trade for furs from the Tahltan. At the same time, the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) was attempting to extend its influence on the fur trade to the Pacific Coast, after Samuel Black explored northern BC in 1824 and brought news that the Russians were trading with the Tlingit for furs. The HBC also attempted to seize control of the Stikine fur trade from the coast, sending a ship, &quot;Dryad&quot;, to establish a trading post at the mouth of the river. However, they were beaten by the Russians who in 1834 built Redoubt St. Dionysius in what is now Wrangell, Alaska. In 1838, HBC trader Robert Campbell reached the upper Stikine River and became the first white man to make contact with the Tahltans. By doing so, Campbell had established the final link of a route connecting the Pacific and Atlantic fur trades, stretching across northern Canada.

In 1839, the HBC leased rights to the Stikine fur trade from the Russians, and took control of Redoubt St. Dionysius, renaming it Fort Stikine. The Tlingit were upset with the HBC in part due to Campbell&#x27;s expedition the previous year, in which he had attempted to establish a trading post at Dease Lake. This was seen as an attempt to break the monopoly the Tlingit held on furs from the interior. The HBC also reduced the price they were willing to pay for furs, further worsening relations with the Tlingit. In 1842 the Tlingit besieged Fort Stikine, and were close to destroying it before the arrival of British and Russian reinforcements. After continued tense relations led to Tlingit attacks in 1846–47, the HBC abandoned the fort in 1849, though they continued to trade in the Stikine River area via ships.

As trading with Westerners increased, the regional balance of power shifted towards the Tlingit, and the Tahltan became more culturally integrated with their coastal neighbors. Intermarriage became increasingly common, Tlingit was adopted as the official language of trade, and Tlingit customs such as potlatch made their way into the interior. Seeking more furs to trade, the Tahltan also expanded their territory beyond the Stikine River basin into the upper Nass and Taku Rivers, leading to conflicts with neighboring tribes.

In the 1830s smallpox, likely introduced via Russian ships and spread up the Stikine by Tlingit traders, killed more than half the Tahltan population. Over the next few decades, repeated waves of smallpox devastated Tlingit and Tahltan populations. At the beginning of the summer 1862 epidemic, numerous Tlingit were working or trading in Victoria, BC when the first cases were discovered. To prevent the spread of disease among the white population, the Tlingit were forced to return to their homelands in southeast Alaska, bringing smallpox with them. Smallpox ravaged the coast over the 1862 summer, killing some 60 percent of the Stikine Tlingit.

===Gold rush period===
Alexander &quot;Buck&quot; Choquette discovered gold on the lower Stikine in 1861, sparking the brief Stikine Gold Rush. More than 800 men departed from Victoria to the Stikine River, where they traveled into the interior on steamboats. The large influx of miners into the Stikine country, along with the businesses that supplied them with provisions, brought an end to Tlingit control of trade on the Stikine. Although not much gold was found on the Stikine, the Stickeen Territories were established to administer the region, and soon incorporated into the Colony of British Columbia. Prospectors continued to push deeper into the Stikine country over the next few years. In light of this and declining profits from the fur trade, Russia feared it would lose control of its North American colonies to Great Britain, and sold Alaska to the United States in 1867. The U.S. Army occupied Fort Stikine in 1868, renaming it Fort Wrangel. Military force was used to assert control over the Tlingit, preventing them from interfering with settlers, prospectors and traders headed to the interior.

In 1866 the Western Union Telegraph Company sought to build a telegraph line connecting North America and Europe, crossing the Bering Strait and Siberia. In order to support construction through the BC interior, large bales of wire were shipped via steamboat to the Stikine&#x27;s head of navigation, which became known as Telegraph Creek. After the completion of the transatlantic telegraph cable in 1867 the project was abandoned, though the name remained. At that point the telegraph had been completed as far north as Hazelton, BC. The section from Quesnel to Hazelton was abandoned and fell into disrepair. Telegraph service was eventually extended to Telegraph Creek and onward to Dawson City, Yukon in 1899, closely following the route laid out three decades before.

In 1871, the US and a newly independent Canada signed a treaty guaranteeing free navigation on the Stikine through American territory. The treaty still applies to Canada&#x27;s use of the river, even though the river is no longer used for commercial shipping. In 1874, gold was discovered near Dease Lake. The Cassiar Gold Rush, lasting until 1880, saw hundreds of miners traveling deep into Tahltan lands and a resurgence in riverboat traffic. Although many Tahltans found employment as packers or hunters during the gold rush period, there were also frequent conflicts due to miners encroaching on their land, while disease continued to reduce Tahltan numbers. In order to protect their culture, several Tahltan clans built a communal village, Tahltan, at the confluence of the Stikine and Tahltan rivers. This village was inhabited until 1920, when its remaining residents moved to Telegraph Creek.

In the late 1890s the Klondike Gold Rush brought even more people to the area. Due to being considered international waters, the Stikine was marketed as the &quot;All-Canadian&quot; route to the Yukon, allowing travelers to avoid customs duties at the Alaska border. In 1897–98 more than three thousand miners passed through the Stikine, many in such a hurry that they embarked in winter and traveled by sled up the frozen river. They camped at Telegraph Creek or Glenora (the head of low water navigation) before continuing overland north to the Yukon. In its promotion of the route, the Canadian government promised a &quot;first-class wagon road&quot; to be built from Telegraph Creek to Teslin Lake, where miners could board boats for the journey down the Yukon River. However, the construction was a fiasco due to delays and engineering challenges, and miners found difficult, muddy conditions waiting for them. By 1900 the gold rush was over, and the boomtowns of the Stikine quickly faded. Glenora was abandoned while Telegraph Creek remained as a small village.

===20th century===

The Stikine remained the primary route to interior northern BC well into the twentieth century. After the end of the Klondike gold rush, riverboats continued to operate on the Stikine, carrying oil, machinery and food upriver and returning with furs and ore, in addition to ferrying passengers. Goods were unloaded at Telegraph Creek and transported by vehicle or pack train to remote inland communities. From the 1930s to the 1960s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was responsible for clearing the navigation channel along the Alaska reach, which is often clogged with snags and driftwood. The shallow channels of the Stikine delta were another hazard to shipping, with boats occasionally stranding at low tide. One of the last boats to operate regularly on the Stikine was the &quot;Judith Ann&quot;, which plied the river between 1950 and 1970. In the 1960s the Cassiar Highway was extended from the Alaska Highway to Dease Lake and Telegraph Creek, and the Stikine gradually faded in importance as a commercial waterway. Commercial boat traffic on the Stikine had mostly ceased by 1972.

Another effort to develop the Stikine country and beyond was the BC government&#x27;s effort to build a railroad to northwest BC starting in the 1950s. The &quot;Pacific Northern Railway&quot; (PNR) was intended to open up the mineral and timber resources of the area and was ultimately proposed to reach Alaska via the Yukon. The proposal died in 1964 due to increasingly poor economic justifications. However, a second attempt was made in the 1970s when BC Rail began constructing the &quot;Dease Lake Extension&quot; from Fort St. James towards the asbestos mines at Cassiar, BC. Construction was cancelled in 1977 as the project went over budget and global prices for copper and asbestos (the main commodities to be hauled by the railway) declined. At that point, of railroad grade had been completed to Dease Lake, but track had only been laid as far as Jackson, well short of the Stikine basin. The abandoned railroad grade still stretches across the Stikine basin today, following portions of the Klappan, Stikine and Tanzilla Rivers. It crosses the Stikine near the Klappan confluence on a steel bridge, which was completed at a cost of $3 million only a few months before the entire project was cancelled. This is the only bridge across the river other than the Highway 37 bridge.

In the 1980s BC Hydro proposed the construction of two hydroelectric dams on the Stikine River and three more on the Stikine&#x27;s tributary, the Iskut River. The dams were projected to add 2,800 megawatts of capacity to the electric grid. The Stikine dams, and high, would have flooded the entire Grand Canyon stretch of the river. The proposal was met with outrage from the general public, the Tahltan tribe, and conservation groups. Two environmental organizations, Friends of the Stikine and Residents for a Free-Flowing Stikine, were formed in direct response to the proposal. BC Hydro camps and survey sites experienced arson and sabotage. In 1983, BC Hydro temporarily postponed the dam projects, citing rising costs, in particular the immense cost just to build transmission lines to the remote Stikine. In 2000 the Tahltan negotiated a management plan with the BC government, which protected parts of the Stikine River including the Grand Canyon from future hydroelectric development.

The Grand Canyon, long considered impassable by boat, was first attempted by American kayaker Rob Lesser and several others in 1981. In 1985 Lesser returned with a larger group in addition to a National Geographic film crew who documented the descent – the first successful run through the entire canyon. In 1992 Doug Ammons completed the first solo descent of the canyon. As of 2016, fewer than 40 paddlers have run the canyon, which is rated Class V+ whitewater, the most difficult possible. A number of boaters have died attempting the run. Because of its danger and difficulty it has earned a reputation as the &quot;K2 of white-water challenges.&quot; In 1995 the Stikine was one of seven initial rivers included in the BC Heritage Rivers system. In 1998, it was nominated for the Canadian Heritage Rivers System.

==Biota==
The Stikine supports runs of five species of native salmon as well as steelhead trout. Chinook salmon (king), running May–July, primarily spawn in the Tahltan, Iskut and Chutine tributaries. Sockeye (red) follow in mid-summer; although they run up many tributaries their largest spawning grounds are at Tahltan Lake, which accounts for 30–60 percent of the total. Pink and chum (dog) salmon spawn in August, primarily in the main Stikine below the Tahltan River; compared to the other species, these runs are relatively small. Coho (silver) spawn in September–October, primarily in the Iskut River, with smaller numbers in the main Stikine. Steelhead spawn in the main Stikine in both spring and fall runs. The Stikine basin is also home to several species of freshwater fish, including the coastal cutthroat, lake, rainbow and Dolly Varden trout, grayling, mountain whitefish and longnose sucker.

The Stikine River and the Taku River are the highest-producing salmon rivers in Southeast Alaska. Although the Stikine is a much larger river, it produces significantly fewer salmon than the Taku basin. This is largely due to geological barriers – such as the rapids of the Grand Canyon, and falls on tributaries such as the Iskut River – which naturally block between 50 and 75 percent of potential spawning habitat within the Stikine basin. Between 2003 and 2010, the Stikine produced an average of 67,000 sockeye salmon each year, while the Taku produced over 110,000 sockeye per year. However, the Stikine produces slightly more chinook salmon, with an average of 40,000 per year compared to 35,000 on the Taku.
Temperate rainforest, dominated by western hemlock and Sitka spruce, extends from Alaska up the lower valleys of the Stikine and Iskut rivers well into BC. Along the river&#x27;s floodplain there are large riparian forests, consisting primarily of cottonwood, alder and willow. Further upstream along the Stikine are boreal forests including white spruce, black spruce, lodgepole pine and subalpine fir, and various hardwoods including aspens, birches and poplars. At higher elevations, dominant subalpine tree species include mountain hemlock, amabilis fir and yellow cedar closer to the coast, while interior species include Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and lodgepole pine. Interior forests also include various riparian hardwoods, such as quaking aspen, birches, willows and poplars. A significant portion of the basin consists of high-elevation, treeless tundra or year-round snow/ice. Overall, the Stikine basin represents eight of fourteen biogeoclimatic zones found in BC.

Across the interior of the Stikine basin, vast expanses of wilderness support a diversity of animal populations including caribou, mountain goats, Stone sheep, black and brown bears, wolverines, marmots, moose and wolves. The Spatsizi Plateau is particularly rich in fauna and has been called the &quot;Serengeti of British Columbia.&quot; Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park, located at the headwaters of the Stikine, includes crucial winter caribou range, as well as the Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve, which preserves mountain goat and sheep habitat. More than 140 species of birds have been observed in the area of the park.

The Stikine River delta is an , up to wide estuary with a mix of freshwater and tidal wetlands, islands, mud and grass flats, and riparian forests. During low flows in winter, exposed glacial sediments in the upstream Stikine River are blown towards the coast to be deposited as loess on delta islands, renewing nutrients in the soil. The delta provides forage for some three million migrating birds each year including geese, ducks, swans and sandhill cranes. It also supports one of North America&#x27;s highest concentrations of bald eagles, which gather to feast on the spring eulachon run. Numerous mammal species also use the delta including Sitka black-tailed deer, moose, bears, gray wolf, coyote, mink, river otter, beaver, seals and sea lions. Where the Stikine delta has partially filled in the Inside Passage at Dry Straits, it has provided a passage for mainland animals such as moose to colonize Mitkof, Kupreanof and Kuiu Islands.

==Recreation and conservation==
The lower Stikine River, with its proximity to the ports of Wrangell and Petersburg, is a popular area for recreational boating, fishing and camping. The section from Telegraph Creek to Wrangell often hosts canoe and raft trips by both commercial outfitters and private groups. The trip takes 7 to 10 days and has a difficulty rating of Class I–II, with only a few small rapids. Numerous features along this section of the Stikine River, including Mud, Flood and Great Glaciers in BC and Chief Shakes Hot Springs in Alaska, are only accessible by boat. In addition, single-day jetboat and kayak tours of the lower Stikine are operated out of Wrangell. These day trips are popular with visitors traveling to southeast Alaska by cruise ship. The upper Stikine River is more technical, with a few class III-IV rapids, but is also suitable for recreational boating. The take-out for the upper Stikine run is at the Cassiar Highway bridge, just upstream of the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is not suitable for recreational boating and should only be attempted by experts. Points further upstream are not accessible by road. Boaters can access the upper Stikine by taking a floatplane to Tuaton or Laslui Lakes.
In 2000, the BC government approved the Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Long Range Management Plan (LRMP) with the goal of &quot;a healthy, productive and sustainable wilderness environment, a thriving and diverse economy, and strong communities supporting a wide range of local employment and lifestyle opportunities.&quot; The LRMP increased the size of existing protected areas (such as provincial parks), added new protected areas, and established special management zones (SMZs) across the Stikine basin. Economic activities such as mining, logging and grazing are allowed on the SMZs, but are subject to regulation, with objectives such as preserving wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities. Following the plan implementation, about 26 percent of the Stikine basin in BC was within provincial parks, and including the SMZs, about 60 percent of the basin was under some form of conservation management.

Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park, established in 1975, encompasses in the upper Stikine, Spatsizi and Klappan River drainages. The western edge of the park can be reached by hiking or biking along the old BC Rail grade, which provides access to several trails leading into the park (motorized vehicles are not allowed). To the north is the long, narrow Stikine River Provincial Park, which protects the Stikine River corridor from the Chukachida River confluence nearly to Telegraph Creek. The Grand Canyon of the Stikine is almost entirely within the park boundaries. First established in 1987 and expanded in 2000 to include the Grand Canyon, the park now includes of the Stikine valley along the western foothills of the Cassiar Mountains. Further downstream the Stikine flows through the northern part of Mount Edziza Provincial Park, established in 1972 to preserve the landscape of basalt flows, cinder cones and craters surrounding the dormant volcano Mount Edziza, which last erupted 10,000 years ago. All three parks provide opportunities for wilderness camping, wildlife viewing, horseback riding, hunting, and fishing.

Several parks along the lower Stikine River can be reached only by boat. The Great Glacier Provincial Park, located near the BC–Alaska border, is home to one of the largest glaciers along the lower Stikine River. Descending from the Stikine Icefield, the glacier forms a meltwater lake that empties directly into the river. Directly across the river is the small Choquette Hot Springs Provincial Park, which includes the namesake hot springs and the site of Alexander Choquette&#x27;s Stikine Gold Rush trading post. In Alaska, the entirety of the river is within the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness of the Tongass National Forest. Designated in 1980, the wilderness includes temperate rainforest, the Stikine River estuary, and the LeConte Glacier – the southernmost tidewater glacier in North America – just to the north of the Stikine&#x27;s mouth. The U.S. Forest Service maintains twelve recreational cabins and several primitive campsites along the Stikine River.

==Economic use and development==
===Fishing===
The Canadian portion of the Stikine River has had a commercial gillnet fishery, based out of Telegraph Creek, since 1975. Due to its remote location, commercial fishing struggled until 1979, when a system was devised to preserve fish in brine-filled barges before transportation by air to the port of Prince Rupert. The two reaches open to commercial fishing are an upper reach from the Tahltan River down to the Chutine River confluence, and a lower reach between the Flood River and the international boundary. Fishing is limited to the main stem and a small portion of the lower Iskut River. The commercial fishing season is generally June through October. First Nation fisheries in the Stikine River include the area upstream of the Chutine River and the lower Tahltan River. The First Nations are allowed a longer fishing season, from April through October. Recreational fishing is also allowed on the Canadian part of the Stikine River between April and October.

In Alaska, commercial fishing on the Stikine falls within the boundaries of District 8, as defined by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G). Salmon are primarily caught offshore by trolling or drift gillnetting, and are either processed on-site or shipped to processing facilities in Wrangell and Petersburg. The ADF&amp;G also issues permits for subsistence fishing on the Alaskan portion of the Stikine.

Sockeye are the predominant commercial species, accounting for over 90 percent of the catch between 1991 and 2000, with chinook and coho making up most of the remainder. US and Canadian shares of the Stikine fishery are regulated by the Pacific Salmon Treaty, signed between the US and Canada in 1985. For sockeye, the Pacific Salmon Commission has established an annual escapement goal of 20,000–40,000 for the main Stikine River and 18,000–30,000 for Tahltan Lake. The chinook escapement goal for the main Stikine is 14,000–28,000. If the annual run is forecasted to be below this level, both Canadian and US fisheries are subject to restrictions. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Stikine sockeye run has been relatively stable. Chinook have seen a significant decline, which has been attributed to reduced marine survival rates.

===Mining===

The Stikine Plateau has extensive mineral deposits including gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, and coal. There are a number of operational mines in the basin in addition to thousands of abandoned mines, many dating back to the gold rush period. One of the largest former mines, the Snip mine near the lower Iskut River, produced of gold prior to shutting down in 1999. Despite the Stikine&#x27;s long history of mining development, in the 1990s and early 2000s both the U.S. Geological Survey and Environment Canada reported water quality in the lower river as generally good, except for elevated copper levels.

Several large new mining developments in the 21st century have generated concern over potential impacts to water quality and fish habitat in the Stikine and Iskut rivers. The Red Chris copper/gold mine near Iskut, BC began operation in 2015, despite concerns raised by the Tlingit tribe and downstream communities in Alaska. The boroughs of Wrangell and Petersburg have expressed concern over the safety of the tailings dam at the Red Chris mine, which is operated by Imperial Metals, the owner of the Mount Polley mine which suffered a tailings dam failure in 2014 that contaminated Quesnel Lake. 
Tahltan tribal leaders have generally been supportive of this mine and some others due to the economic benefits for the region; however, they have opposed projects that impact sites of cultural significance.

The Klappan Coalbed Methane Project, first proposed in 2004, would drill for natural gas on the Spatsizi Plateau in the middle of the Sacred Headwaters, where the Stikine, Skeena and Nass rivers rise. The Tahltan heavily protested this development, which was in an area of great cultural importance to them. In addition, the drilling operations would have released large amounts of briny waste effluent into nearby streams. In 2012 the BC government scrapped the project, and announced it would not issue any more drilling permits for the area. The proposed Galore Creek mine, located in BC from the Alaska border, sits on one of the largest undeveloped copper/gold deposits in the world. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources has expressed concern over the safety of tailings storage there. As of 2020, the project was on hold due to economic uncertainties.

===Energy and infrastructure projects===
In 2014, BC Hydro completed the first stage of the Northwest Transmission Line (NTL), extending the electric grid north from Terrace to the community of Iskut near the Stikine River. The Red Chris mine was the first development to receive power from the line. Several run-of-the-river type hydroelectric projects, smaller in scale than the massive dams proposed in the 1980s, have been built in the Stikine basin to feed power into the extended grid. The largest of these is the 195 megawatt Forrest Kerr hydroelectric plant on the Iskut River, completed in 2014. The NTL project is part of the Alaska–BC Intertie, planned to connect Southeast Alaska to the North American power grid via BC. The Alaska Energy Authority has criticized the plans, as the low population, long distances, and rugged terrain would make a region-wide power grid uneconomical.

The Southeast Mid-Region Access Project, first proposed in 1978, would create a road connection from southeast Alaska to the Cassiar Highway, enabling ore and timber to be exported from the interior via Alaskan ports. One of the proposed alternatives would construct a road along the lower Stikine and Iskut Rivers – currently a roadless wilderness area – with either a ferry terminal or bridges connecting to Wrangell and Petersburg. The completion of the road is also seen as an opportunity to complete the Alaska–BC Intertie, as the Forrest Kerr hydro plant is less than from the Alaska border. Both the BC and Alaska governments have strongly supported the project, while other port cities such as BC, which would see economic competition from Alaskan shipping, have opposed it. The road project faces environmental challenges as well, as the Stikine River route would pass through the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness.

<doc id="717762" wikidata="Q365352" url="?curid=717762" title="Agustín Pedro Justo">
<text>Agustín Pedro Justo Rolón (26 February 1876 – 11 January 1943) was the president of Argentina from 1932 to 1938, during the Infamous Decade. Justo took part in the coup of 1930, becoming president two years later thanks to widespread electoral fraud. His presidency was part of the period known as the Infamous Decade, which lasted from 1930 until 1943. He established the country&#x27;s central bank and introduced a nationwide income tax.

Appointed War Minister by President Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, his experience under a civilian administration and pragmatic outlook earned him the conservative Concordance&#x27;s nomination for the 1931 campaign. He was elected president on 8 November 1931, supported by the political sectors that would form shortly after la Concordancia, an alliance created between the National Democratic Party (&quot;Partido Demócrata Nacional&quot;), the Anti-personalist Radical Civic Union (&quot;Unión Cívica Radical Antipersonalista&quot;) (UCRA), and the Independent Socialist Party (&quot;Partido Socialista Independiente&quot;). There were accusations of electoral fraud, and the name &quot;patriotic fraud&quot; was used for a system of control established from 1931 to 1943. Conservative groups wanted to use this to prevent any radicals from coming to power. During this period there was persistent opposition from the supporters of Yrigoyen, an earlier president, and from the Radical Civic Union.

The outstanding diplomatic work of his Foreign Minister, Carlos Saavedra Lamas, was one of the greatest accomplishments of his administration, stained by constant accusations of corruption and of delivering the national economy into the hands of foreign interests, the British in particular, with whom his vice-president Julio A. Roca Jr. had signed the Roca-Runciman Treaty. His name was mentioned as a candidate a new period during the unsteady government of Ramón Castillo, but his early death at 66 thwarted his plans. He worked on a preliminary study for the complete works of Bartolomé Mitre, whom he admired profoundly.

==Biography==
Justo was born in Concepción del Uruguay, Entre Ríos Province. His father, also named Agustín, had been governor of Corrientes Province and was soon a national deputy. He was active in politics, and soon after his son was born, he moved with his family to Buenos Aires. His mother Otilia Rolón came from a traditional Corrientes family. When he was 11 Justo went to the &quot;Colegio Militar de la Nación&quot; (National Military College). As a cadet he joined with various other students and participated in the &quot;Revolución del Parque&quot;, taking the weapons off the guards to add to the column of the revolutionaries. Arrested and later given amnesty, he graduated with the rank of ensign.

Without abandoning his military career, he studied engineering at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1895 he was promoted to second lieutenant. In 1897 he became first lieutenant. In 1902 he became a captain. Having attained a civil engineering degree at the University of Buenos Aires, a governmental decree validated his title as a military engineer in 1904. He was appointed as teacher at the &quot;Escuela de Aplicación para Oficiales&quot;. With his promotion to the rank of major two years later he was proposed for the school of mathematics at the Military Academy and for the studies of telemetry and semaphores at the &quot;Escuela Nacional de Tiro&quot; (National Gunnery School), which would be granted in 1907.

The following year, he received the nomination as executive officer in the &quot;Batallón de Ferrocarrileros&quot;, at the same time in which they were promoting him to be subdirector at the gunnery school. With the rank of Lieutenant Colonel he completed diplomatic actions, becoming military attaché to the Argentina&#x27;s envoy at the centennial festivities in Chile in 1910. His return to Argentina was to Córdoba, as commander of the Fourth Artillery Brigade.

===Beginning of political career===
In 1915, during the term of office of Victorino de la Plaza, he was appointed director of the Military College, a post where he would remain for the following seven years. The great influence of this position helped him to weave contacts in political circles, just as in the military. Pursuant to the radical anti-personalist political branch (those that opposed the party leadership of Hipólito Yrigoyen), he established good relations with Marcelo T. de Alvear. During his tenure he enlarged the curriculum of the college and promoted the formation of the faculty.

During Alvear&#x27;s administration in 1922 he left the Military College to become the Minister of War. Promoted to the rank of brigadier general on 25 August 1923, Justo requested an increase of the defense budget to get equipment and improve the Army infrastructure. He also fomented the reorganization of the armed forces structure. At the end of 1924 he was sent as plenipotentiary to Peru, where they were celebrating the centennial of the Battle of Ayacucho. During the next few years, he temporarily was the Minister of Agriculture and Public Works, besides holding the post at as Minister of War, which he would not abandon until the end of the term of office of Alvear. In 1927 he had received the promotion to &quot;General de División&quot; (Major General).

With his constant anti-personalist temperament, Justo supported the candidates Leopoldo Melo and Vicente Gallo, of the Alvear Line of the UCR. Before the triumph of the formula of Yrigoyen and Beiró, who began in 1928 their second term of office with massive support of the voters and the majority in the House of Representatives. Justo received invitations of the ever more organized right to join the &quot;shock program&quot; against the radical &quot;caudillo&quot;. Although close to the concepts of the publications &quot;La Nueva República&quot; (The New Republic) — managed by Ernesto Palacio and the brothers Rodolfo and Julio Irazusta — and &quot;La Fronda&quot;, under the direction of Francisco Uriburu, they stayed close to the need of &quot;order, hierarchy and authority&quot;. He did not adhere closely to them, the program of suppression of a republican government and their substitution with a corporative system, similar to the fascists in Italy and Spain, went against his liberal vocation.

===1930 Coup===

Around Justo another faction assembled, not any less intent on taking arms against the constitutional government of Yrigoyen. Actively promoted by general José Luis Meglione, a Justo classmate, and by colonel Luis J. García, who soon would be one of the heads of the &quot;Grupo de Oficiales Unidos&quot;, he wrote for the newspapers &quot;La Nación&quot; and &quot;Crítica&quot;. Declarations made by Justo in July 1930 about the inconvenience of military intervention, which would put the constitutional rule of law in danger, testify to the opposition between the factions. By contrast with the more radicalized Argentine Navy, a significant part of the Army supported the ideas proposed by Justo, with the notable exception of the nationalist core that soon would converge at the &quot;Grupo de Oficiales Unidos&quot;. Before the promise of José Félix Uriburu, the head of an extremist group, to maintain institutional order, Justo gave his agreement to the coup, which he expressed on the early morning of 6 September, thus starting a military government in Argentina for the first time since the signing of the Constitution. He did not join the government&#x27;s direction nor, in the first instance, the governing group, which was led by Uriburu with a cabinet that was composed largely of local lobbyists of the multinational oil companies.

Justo expressly sought to distance himself from Uriburu, who counted on a large group of supporters among the military officials but could not get the same support from the political parties, which quickly divided themselves after Yrigoyen&#x27;s death, the focus of the antipathy against him. He rejected the vice-presidency that Uriburu offered him, and he only briefly accepted the command of the army, resigning soon after. In Buenos Aires Province, Uriburu did not manage to implement the corporate model with which he wished to replace the republican system, and this failure cost him the political career of his Interior Minister, Matías Sánchez Sorondo. Justo again rejected the offers of Uriburu to join the government and form a coalition. With the support of an alliance of the conservative National Democratic Party, the Independent Socialist Party, and the most anti-personalist faction of the Radical Party (then to be the Coalition of Parties for Democracy), he ran for president on the elections of 8 November 1931. With Yrigoyen&#x27;s faction banned from the elections and its supporters using the strategy of &quot;revolutionary abstention&quot;, Justo easily won against Lisandro de la Torre and Nicolás Repetto, although under suspicion of fraud. Julio Argentino Roca Jr., from the conservative faction, joined him as vice-president.

==Presidency (1932–1938)==
Justo became president on 20 February 1932. In addition to political turmoil caused by the coup, he had to make progress on the problems relating to the Great Depression, which had put an end to commercial profits and the full employment enjoyed by the Yrigoyen and Alvear administrations. His first minister of the Treasury, Alberto Hueyo, took very restrictive measures against the economy. The independent socialist Antonio de Tomaso joined him in Agriculture. He reduced the public expense and restricted the circulation of currency and applied harsh fiscal measures. An &quot;empréstito patriótico&quot;, or patriotic loan, was made, attempting to strengthen the financial coffers. The first of these measures was imposed on gasoline. It was meant to finance the newly created Dirección Nacional de Vialidad, or the National Office of Public Highways, which undertook the betterment of the highway network. The difficulties for Hueyo&#x27;s program would finally convince Justo to adopt this model in his economic policy. In addition, he encouraged the project of the mayor of Buenos Aires, Mariano de Vedia y Mitre, who undertook an ambitious project of urban organization, opening the Diagonal Norte and Diagonal Sur, paving Avenida General Paz, widening Avenida Corrientes, constructing the first stretch of 9 de Julio Avenue and building the Obelisco de Buenos Aires.

The substitution of Hueyo by the independent socialist Federico Pinedo would mark a change in the political scene in the government. The intervention of the government in the economy was more significant, creating the Junta Nacional de Granos, or the National Grain Committee, and of Meat, and soon after, with the advice of English economist Otto Niemeyer, the creation of the Banco Central de la República Argentina, or the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic.

===Relationship with the UCR===
The radical opposition was very significant. On 5 April 1931, the political ideology of the supporters of Yrigoyen had won the election for governor in the province of Buenos Aires against the hopes of Uriburu and Sánchez Sorondo; though the military government rings, cost the career of the Minister and forced Uriburu to give up his power. Before this, soldiers loyal to the constitutional government of Yrigoyen, with the support of armed civilians, organized insurrections to restore that earlier government. The first of these was directed by the Yrigoyenist general Severino Toranzo in February 1931. In June, in Curuzú Cuatiá in the province of Corrientes, they assassinated Colonel Regino Lescano, who was preparing a Yrigoyenist mobilization. In December, before an attempted coup led by Lieutenant Colonel Atilio Cattáneo, Justo decreed a state of siege, and again imprisoned the old Yrigoyen, and also arrested Alvear, Ricardo Rojas, Honorio Pueyrredón, and other leaders of the party.

In 1933, the attempted coups continued. Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Entre Rios, and Misiones would be the stage of radical uprisings, which would not end before more than a thousand people being detained. Seriously ill, Yrigoyen was returned to Buenos Aires and kept under house arrest. He died on 3 June, and his burial in La Recoleta Cemetery was an occasion of a mass demonstration. In December, during a meeting of the national convention of the UCR, a joint uprising of the military and politicians broke loose in Santa Fe, Rosario, and Paso de los Libres. José Benjamin Abalos, who was Yrigoyen&#x27;s ex-Minister, and Colonel Roberto Bosch were arrested during the uprising and the organizers and leaders of the party were imprisoned at Martín García. Alvear, Justo&#x27;s former patron, was exiled, while others were detained in the penitentiary in Ushuaia.

===Roca-Runciman Treaty===

One of the most controversial events of Justo&#x27;s presidency took place in 1933, when the measures of production protectionism that were adopted by the UK led Justo to send his vice-president at the head of a technology delegation, to deal with the adoption of a commercial agreement that might benefit Argentina. At the 1932 Ottawa Conference, the British had adopted measures that favored imports from its own colonies and dominions. The pressure from the Argentine landowners for whom the government restored trade with the main buyer of Argentine grain and meat had been very strong. Led by the president of the British Trade Council, Viscount Walter Runciman, they were intense and resulted in the signing on 27 April of the Roca-Runciman Treaty.

The treaty created a scandal because the UK allotted Argentina a quota less than any of its other dominions. In exchange for many concessions to British companies, 390,000 tons of meat per year were allotted to Argentina. British refrigerated shippers arranged 85% of exportation. The tariffs of the railways operated by the UK were not regulated. They had not established customs fees over coal. They had given special dispensation to the British companies with investments in Argentina. They had reduced the prices of their exports. As many problems resulted from the declarations of the vice-president Roca, who affirmed after the signing of the treaty that &quot;by its economic importance, Argentina resembled just a large British dominion.&quot;

Lisandro de la Torre, one of his most vociferous and principal opponents, mocking the words of Roca in an editorial, wrote that &quot;in these conditions we wouldn&#x27;t be able to say that Argentina had been converted into a British dominion because England does not take the liberty to impose similar humiliations upon its dominions.&quot;

In the National Democratic Party, one of those who had supported the nomination of Justo for President, had split because of this controversy. Finally, the Senate rescinded the treaty on 28 July. Many worker strikes followed the deliberations, especially in Santa Fé Province, which ended with government intervention.

==Death==
He died in 1943 and was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

<text>Lieutenant General José Félix Benito Uriburu y Uriburu (20 July 186829 April 1932) was the President of the Provisional Government of Argentina, ousting the successor to President Hipólito Yrigoyen by means of a military coup and declaring himself president. From 6 September 1930 to 20 February 1932, he controlled both the Executive and Legislative branches of government. As &quot;President of the Provisional Government,&quot; he acted as the &quot;de facto&quot; Head of state of Argentina. His was the first of a series of successful coups d&#x27;état and unconstitutional governments that came to power in 1943, 1955, 1962, 1966, and 1976.

Uriburu&#x27;s coup was supported by the &quot;Nacionalistas&quot;, a far-right Argentine nationalist movement that around 1910 grew out of the &quot;traditionalist&quot; position, which was based on nostalgia for feudal economic relations and a more &quot;organic&quot; social order.

In the aftermath of the coup, major changes to Argentine politics and government took place, with Uriburu banning political parties, suspending elections, and suspending the 1853 Constitution. Uriburu proposed that Argentina be reorganized along corporatist and fascist lines.

==Biography==
Uriburu was born on 20 July 1868 in Salta to José de Uriburu y Poveda and Serafina de Uriburu y Álvarez de Arenales, who were cousins. He was also the nephew of President José Evaristo Uriburu and a descent of Juan Antonio Álvarez de Arenales, a general in the Spanish American wars of independence. According to genealogist Narciso Binayán Carmona, he was descended from Spanish conquistador Domingo Martínez de Irala. On 17 March 1885, he entered the Colegio Militar de la Nación as a cadet. With the rank of sublieutenant, he was one of the 33 officers that participated in the organization of the Revolution of the Park in 1890.

On 19 November 1894, he married Aurelia Madero Buján (1873–1959), the daughter of Eduardo Madero and Marcelina Buján Ellauri, with whom he had three children: Alberto Eduardo, Elena, Teresa, and Marta Mercedes. He served as an assistant to his uncle José Uriburu and to president Luis Sáenz Peña. In 1905, he supported President Manuel Quintana in the suppression of the Radical Revolution of 1905. In 1907, he became the director of the Superior School of War and was later sent to Germany for three years to perfect his training program. When he returned to Buenos Aires, he attended the scientific conventions for the Centennial celebrations and later took the command of Chief of Staff in the Argentine borderlands. In 1913, he returned to Europe as a military attaché to Germany and the United Kingdom. When he returned to Argentina in 1914, he was elected to the Argentine National Congress. In 1921, he ascended to the rank of Division General, and the following year was appointed inspector general of the army by Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. He was a member of the Supreme Council of War until 1926, when Yrigoyen forced him to retire for having reached the age of retirement.

== 1930 coup d&#x27;etat ==
=== Economic crisis ===
The world economic crisis in 1929, known as the Great Depression, had a profound impact on Argentina. It primarily affected the economy, since 80% of its revenue came from foreign trade. The crisis created a situation of social tension, with decreases in salary and increases in unemployment. This economic unrest created the political context for the 1930 coup. This crisis of democratic systems was seen throughout all of Latin America.

Furthermore, the social teachings of the Catholic Church at the time were based in the 1891 encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;, which dealt with the conditions of the working class, made clear the church&#x27;s support for workers&#x27; unions, reaffirmed its support for the right to private property, and discussed relations between the government, corporations, workers, and the Church, proposing a socioeconomic relationship which later became known as corporatism.

=== Corporatist doctrines ===
The nationalist ideologies that arose from the rise to power of Italy&#x27;s Benito Mussolini, who supported the introduction of corporatism, created a division within the People&#x27;s Party and its eventual dissolution. It was then that the Catholic nationalists supported the publication &quot;La Nueva República,&quot; a newspaper opposed to the radical government of Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was harshly criticized for a series of federal interventions and for his government&#x27;s ties to assassinating opposition leaders, such as Senator Lencinas, which produced a weakening of the democracy and led to the military coup led by general José Félix Uriburu. 
=== 6 September 1930 uprising ===
On 6 September 1930, Uriburu staged a coup d&#x27;état that overthrew the constitutional government of Hipólito Yrigoyen and established a military dictatorship, the first of several that lasted until 1983. At the time, Uriburu essentially represented Catholic neo-corporatist nationalism. Plans rooted in this ideology included a system in which there would be corporate chamber with representation from unions and businesses, and another chamber with political representation. It could be said that this ideology was rooted in the Catholic nationalism which had been on the rise in Argentina since the 1920s.

The coup d&#x27;état that came to power was unprecedented in the modern history of Argentina. According to Argentine philosopher Mario Bunge, the 1930 military coup ended a half-century-long period of internal peace and ongoing economic, political, and cultural progress in the country. It was also the first time that fascism rose its head in the continent; the first time in the history of the country that the Armed Forces took political power; the first time since the Tragic Week of 1919 and the repression of the Patagonia Rebelde of 1922 that the government assassinated union members; and the first time since the end of Rosas&#x27; dictatorship that the Catholic Church had meddled in politics, this time with a distinctly fascist orientation.

Uriburu entrusted poet Leopoldo Lugones with the task of writing the revolutionary proclamation, although the first version was accused of being fascist by Colonel José María Sarobe and General Agustín P. Justo, who represented the traditional conservative liberalism in Argentina. Lugones therefore had to modify the proclamation. The proclamation read: The Army and Navy of the Fatherland, responding to the unanimous fervor of the people of the Nation and the urgent purposes that the duty of the Argentines imposes upon us in this solemn hour for the fate of the country, have resolved to raise the flag in order to cut ties with the men of the government, who have betrayed the trust of the people and of the Republic, and demand the immediate discharge of their command, which they no longer execute for the common good, but for their personal desires. We therefore notify you categorically that they no longer have the support of the armed forces, whose primary objective is to defend personal respect, which they have compromised, and there will no longer be in our ranks a single man who will uprise against his comrade to defend a cause that has become the shame of the Nation. We also notify you that we will not tolerate last-minute maneuvers or communications that hope to save a government repudiated by public opinion or keep in power the remains of a political conglomeration that is strangling the Republic.

== Military government ==
On 10 September 1930, Uriburu was recognized as President of the Nation by means of an infamous and controversial ruling by the Supreme Court, which gave rise to the De facto government doctrine. This doctrine legitimized the new government, &quot;as long as it executes the administrative and political function derived from its possession of the force as guarantee of order and social security.&quot; He dissolved the National Congress, declared a state of siege, replaced the governors of the provinces with radical governors through federal intervention, and attempted to establish a neo-corporatist government. In this system of government, similar to fascism, Uriburu saw an example of peace and political order. On 18 September 1930, the ambassadors from the United States and England (a country Uriburu had served as an attaché), recognized his provisional government.

Though Uriburu publicly claimed to respect the Constitution, he personally felt that it was necessary to return the country to the rule of a conservative government as was the case prior to the Law of Sáenz Peña, which had established a secret vote for all men over 18. In a speech given to the Superior School of War, Uriburu expressed his opposition to universal suffrage: We must try to achieve a political authority based in reality rather than purely theory... Aristotle defined democracy as a government by those best fit to rule. The difficulty is in making those who are best fit the rulers. It is difficult to make that happen in any country where, like ours, there is a 60% illiteracy rate, therefore it is clear and evident that it is those 60% that govern the country, because in legal elections, they are the majority.

He established a repressive regime that included for the first time the systematic use of torture against political opponents, particularly anarchists, communists, and radical yrigoyenists, using the Sector of Public Order of the Capital Police, with Leopoldo Lugones, Jr. at the helm. He declared martial law and executed anarchist militants such as Severino Di Giovanni, Gregorio Galeano, José Gatti, Joaquín Penina, Paulino Scarfó and Jorge Tamayo Gavilán. He imprisoned several political leaders, such as former president Hipólito Yrigoyen; censured news publications; and took over the nation&#x27;s universities, eliminating the autonomy and co-government that they had enjoyed since the University Reform of 1918. Once the coup had taken place, the newly founded General Confederation of Labor (CGT) adopted an attitude of complacency towards the military regime.

In the economic sphere, the Great Depression had an impact on the country and caused a significant decrease in revenue, a decline in consumption, and an increase in unemployment. In the political sphere, Uriburu attempted a highly repressive model of government, with martial law and military courts to try civilians who opposed the &quot;de facto&quot; government. His idea was to establish a corporative regime in the style of Italian fascist Benito Mussolini, but the result of the elections demonstrated that it did not have popular support and he was unable to follow through with the plan.

In early 1931, he called elections in the Province of Buenos Aires, but later annulled them after the Radical Civic Union (UCR) won. In November of that year, he again called elections after prohibiting UCR candidates and organizing a system that was broadly recognized as fraudulent, marking the beginning of the so-called Infamous Decade in Argentina. It was under these conditions that General Agustín P. Justo was elected president, representing the party that had earlier been wiped out by the Sáenz Peña Law.

In March 1931, Uriburu received Edward Windsor, then prince of Wales and later King Edward VIII, with whom he visited the Campo de Mayo, the National Hippodrome, and the seaside resort of Mar del Plata to inaugurate the British Exposition of Arts and Industries at La Rural.
== Cabinet ==
== Death ==
After turning his power over to Agustín P. Justo, he left the country for health reasons and died in Paris two months later after undergoing surgery for stomach cancer. His body was later repatriated and buried at the Recoleta Cemetery.

== Removal of memorials ==
During the 20th century, several busts and memorial were created and streets named in the dictator&#x27;s honor, many during &quot;de facto&quot; governments. However, during the 21st century, these monuments have been removed and the streets renamed.

In the city of San Carlos de Bolívar, there was a bust of Uriburu in Las Acollaradas Park, but in 2012 the city council voted to remove it. In the city of Balcarce, there is still a monument on Avenida Favaloro, previously named Avenida Uriburu. While the City Council approved its removal in 2014, the monument still remains. Until 2015, there was a bust of Uriburu in Park Mitre in the city of Olavarría just a few meters from the Monument to Liberty erected by the French. It was removed in 1966 and kept in a municipal warehouse. Later, the municipal leader Enrique Mario Alfieri, put in by &quot;de facto&quot; President Juan Carlos Onganía, placed it on his desk, and in 1973, another conservative municipal leader, Juan Ángel Moya, this time put in by &quot;de facto&quot; President Roberto M. Levingston, returned the bust to the park, just before that year&#x27;s 11 March Democratic Elections. In January 2019, the bust was removed after city council approval.

<text>In physics, a kinetic term is the part of the Lagrangian that is bilinear in the fields (and for nonlinear sigma models, they are not even bilinear), and usually contains two derivatives with respect to time (or space); in the case of fermions, the kinetic term usually has one derivative only. The equation of motion derived from such a Lagrangian contains differential operators which are generated by the kinetic term. Unitarity requires kinetic terms to be positive.

In mechanics, the kinetic term is

<text>Dillard University is a private, historically black university in New Orleans, Louisiana. Founded in 1930 and incorporating earlier institutions founded as early as 1869 after the American Civil War, it is affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the United Methodist Church.

== History ==
The history of Dillard University dates to 1869 and its founding predecessor institutions—Straight University (later renamed Straight College) and Union Normal School (which developed into New Orleans University).

=== Straight University ===
Responding to the post-Civil War need to educate newly freed African Americans in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the surrounding region, the American Missionary Association of the Congregational Church founded Straight University on June 12, 1868.

Straight University also offered professional training, including a law department from 1874 to 1886. Its graduates participated in local and national Reconstruction and post-Reconstruction era civil rights struggles.

Straight University was renamed Straight College in 1915, to better reflect the limitations of its curriculum.

=== Union Normal School/New Orleans University ===
The Union Normal School was established on July 8, 1868, by the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church to train teachers. The Society also recruited teachers in the North to work in the South educating freedmen and their children.

In addition to Straight University, the AMA helped found several other historically black colleges and universities, such as Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Howard University (with Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau), Huston-Tillotson University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Talladega College, and Tougaloo College. Straight University and Union Normal School later became known and developed as Straight College and New Orleans University, respectively. Both schools offered education for elementary-level teachers, but quickly enlarged their curricula to include secondary, collegiate, and professional-level instruction.

New Orleans University operated a secondary school, Gilbert Academy. By the 1890s, the university offered professional medical training. It included a school of pharmacy, the Flint Medical College, and the Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School. After the medical college was closed in 1911, the Flint Goodridge Hospital emerged and continued nurse training.

=== &quot;A Great Negro University in New Orleans&quot;: 1930–1935 ===
Local Black and White leaders felt there was a need to develop a larger, more notable African-American institution of higher learning in New Orleans and the greater South. Due to economic hardships and rounds of negotiations between the two institutions, Straight College and New Orleans University chartered Dillard University on June 6, 1930.

Named after James H. Dillard, the new university was created to &quot;... offer a traditional liberal arts curriculum—rather than nonprofessional, vocational training&quot; and emphasize a close engagement with the Black community through &quot;various education extension programs, societies, and clubs.&quot; Its development was tempered by the Jim Crow era. Many local whites took issue with the possibility of a black president presiding over white faculty members. The increased numbers of African-American bus riders in the Gentilly area, as students started attending classes, disturbed some white residents. Edgar B. Stern Sr, an influential and diplomatic member of Dillard&#x27;s board of trustees, suggested Will W. Alexander as a compromise candidate for president. A white Southern preacher, he became Dillard&#x27;s first acting president (1935–1936). His experience as the director of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation proved valuable. Dillard University opened its doors in the fall of 1935, and was able to attract prominent scholars such as Horace Mann Bond, psychology and education; Frederick Douglass Hall, music; Lawrence D. Reddick, history; and St. Clair Drake, sociology and anthropology.

=== Hurricane Katrina ===
In August 2005, the campus, not far from the lower levee breach of the London Avenue Canal, suffered extensive flood damage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Nelson Hall was destroyed by a fire. A bus fire destroyed belongings of 37 students who were in the process of being evacuated.

In spring 2006, the students of Dillard University took their classes at The New Orleans World Trade Center and The New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel. As is tradition, Dillard held graduation on the Rosa Freeman Keller Avenue of the Oaks in July 2006. Students returned to campus in September 2006.

===Ray Charles Program===
In 2003, musician Ray Charles added a provision in his will to endow a $1 million (~$ in ) professorship of African-American culinary history at Dillard. It is the first such position in the country, and is called the Ray Charles Program.

=== 2016 senatorial debate ===

In November 2016, Raycom Media rented a space at Dillard University to host a debate with senatorial candidates, including David Duke. The event was met with opposition; six protesters were arrested. When the rental agreement was made, months in advance, the university was unaware of the candidates.

===Partnership with Ross University School of Medicine===
In 2019, Dillard signed a partnership with a for-profit college, Ross University School of Medicine, to increase the number of African American physicians in the US.

===Scott&#x27;s donation===
In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $5 million (~$ in ) to Dillard University. Her donation is the largest single gift in Dillard&#x27;s history.

== Academics ==
Dillard University offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees in over 35 majors. These majors are organized within four academic colleges, and further subdivided by departments.

=== Undergraduate research ===
The university is a member of the Council of Undergraduate Research and the National Council of Undergraduate Research. Most departments offer courses in methodology, and the university&#x27;s Office of Undergraduate Research organizes additional workshops on writing proposals, analyzing data, and using human participants. Students can participate in A Katrina Recovery Initiative (AKRI), Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LAMP), and the Undergraduate Research &amp; Creative Work Competition. The university also produces the Dillard University Journal of Undergraduate Research (DUJOUR), which publishes the findings and articles of finished undergraduate research projects.

=== Institute of Jazz Culture (IOJC) ===
The Institute of Jazz Culture was established in 2002 by founding director, Irvin Mayfield at the intersection of community, jazz and education. Under the current leadership of Edward Anderson, Assistant Professor of Music and Director of the IOJC, the institute is producing curriculum and programming on the collegiate and the secondary levels.

=== Dual degree programs===
Dillard has dual degree programs in multiple disciplines with institutions such as Louisiana State University, Tulane University, University of New Orleans, Georgia Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Texas Chiropractic College, and Western Michigan University.

== Athletics ==
The Dillard athletic teams are called the Bleu Devils and Lady Bleu Devils. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the HBCU Athletic Conference (HBCUAC), formerly known as the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC), since the 1981–82 academic year.

Dillard competes in 12 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and dance.

===Facilities===
The Dillard basketball teams and volleyball team play at Dent Hall.

<doc id="717795" wikidata="Q363586" url="?curid=717795" title="Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear">
<text>Máximo Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear y Pacheco (4 October 1868 – 23 March 1942) served as president of Argentina between from 1922 to 1928.

His period of government coincided precisely with the end of the postwar world crisis, which allowed him to improve the economy and finances of the country without major setbacks. He also stood out in the development of the automotive industry and the successful oil exploitation, with which he achieved an economic prosperity unknown until then for Argentina, and that was demonstrated with the great increase achieved in the GDP per inhabitant. In 1928, he had reached the sixth position among the highest in the world. In the labor and social sphere, this period was characterized by a process of urban concentration in the Litoral and Greater Buenos Aires, in addition to the establishment of half a million immigrants; there was an increase in the middle class, a rise in real wages, and a decrease in strikes and similar conflicts.

When he left the presidency he settled in France. He returned to the country a few years later to reunify his party and try to become president for the second time in 1931, but his candidacy was prohibited by the military regime of José Félix Uriburu. Alvear, along with other radical coreligionists, was persecuted, imprisoned or had to go into exile on repeated occasions by the repressive regime of the infamous decade, for which he experienced the Martín García prison on the island.

On 23 March 1942 struck down by a heart attack, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear died next to his wife Regina Pacini at their home in Don Torcuato.

==Biography==

Máximo Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear was born on 4 October 1868 in the city of Buenos Aires. son of Torcuato de Alvear and Elvira Pacheco y Reinoso, descended from the wealthy Alvear family, a patrician family of Basque origin.

His great-grandfather Diego de Alvear y Ponce de León participated in the setting of boundaries with Brazil and became Brigadier General of the Royal Spanish Armada in 1770. His grandfather Carlos María de Alvear became supreme director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and commander of the national Army in the war in Brazil. His father Torcuato de Alvear was mayor of the city of Buenos Aires.

Alvear&#x27;s youth was typical of that of a young man of the aristocracy. He frequented the different circuits of the Buenos Aires night, which ranged from the respectable theaters in the centre of the city of Buenos Aires to meeting places of dubious reputation.

He entered the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires in 1879. His studies were very irregular: he finished second and third years only in 1881; two years later, the fourth and fifth, concluding his studies in 1885; however, he had finished high school at the National School of Rosario. In February 1886, he asked Dr. Manuel Obarrio, dean of the Law School of the University of Buenos Aires, to enroll him as a regular student to study Law. In that same year he failed in Introduction to Law, but approved Public International Law. He was taking subjects regularly, without delays and with high marks, especially in the courses on civil law. Finally in 1891, just a year after the death of his father, he obtained his law degree.

The young Alvear, along with his fellow students and friends José Luis Cantilo, Fernando Saguier and Tomás Le Breton, formed a group with a certain reputation as public troublemakers. Some of those altercations even ended with some of the gang members in jail.

A man of fortune, he traveled widely in Europe and in 1906 he married the lyrical artist Regina Paccini in Lisbon; but his estrangement did not prevent him from following closely the events of the country and maintaining his interest in the efforts of radicalism in favor of the purity of suffrage and free vote.

=== Political career ===
Alvear had an outstanding performance by successfully organizing the meeting in the Florida Garden on 1 September 1889, a meeting that helped popularize Leandro N. Alem among the youth of Buenos Aires, who had been retired from political life since the 1880s. In this meeting the Revolution of the Park was also devised. Alvear was in charge of organizing the event, which was well attended. Immediately after the meeting at the Florida Garden, he began to work as Alem&#x27;s secretary, and also accompanied him after the founding in 1890 of the Unión Cívica. In turn, he was a member and later president of the Socorro Club, member of the Directive Commission of the Civic Union and secretary of its National Committee. There are not many records of Alvear&#x27;s performance in the Park Revolution, since he acted anonymously.

In the middle of the year 1891 the division of the Civic Union took place, between the supporters of Leandro N. Alem and those of Bartolomé Mitre; Alvear – whose father had been an autonomist – chose to stay on Alem&#x27;s side, and was one of the signatories of the manifesto of 2 July of that year, the founding act of the Unión Cívica Radical. That same year, Alvear accompanied the radical caudillo on a tour of the interior of the country to launch the Bernardo de Irigoyen-Juan M. Garro formula.

During the afternoon of 30 July 1893, an emissary informed the young Alvear, who was in the box of the Lyric Theater, that in half an hour he had to leave to participate in the radical revolution. He withdrew at night and, with the help of Aurelio Bagú as a guide along with other young people, they took over the Temperley police station. Three days later, Hipólito Yrigoyen arrived with 1500 men, after revolting the entire centre of the province of Buenos Aires. Yrigoyen, along with four thousand men, entered the city, where they were applauded by its inhabitants. On 4 August the head of the rebellion created several battalions to defend his settlement at Temperley.
With the Sáenz Peña law of 1912, which established the secret and compulsory vote, the radicals abandoned the electoral abstention and Alvear was elected national deputy for the capital. Shortly afterwards he was taken to the presidency of the Jockey Club.

=== Regina and his years in France ===
In 1898, Alvear met the Portuguese soprano Regina Pacini, his future wife, when she was giving a season in Buenos Aires, at the General San Martín Municipal Theater. However, a first attempt to woo her was unsuccessful. Thus, Alvear left for Europe on the longest of the many trips he had made, determined to go after the Portuguese soprano, even going so far as to follow her throughout Europe, since the &quot;persecution&quot; would last eight years. At that time it was not well seen for an aristocrat to marry an artist.

They finally got married at seven in the morning on Saturday, 29 April 1907, in the Lisbon church of Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación. After getting married, Alvear lived in Paris for several years.
=== Deputy and ambassador ===
When the Chamber of Deputies was renewed, he was elected deputy for the province of Buenos Aires; He was a hardworking parliamentarian and presented to Congress a bill related to civil servants of the State, which tended to base promotions in the hierarchical ladder by competition and antecedents.

During his period as a deputy he presented projects for the regulation of the civil code, debated on the organization of the army, He also supported, together with the deputies Carlos Saavedra Lamas, Julio Argentino Pascual Roca and Lisandro de la Torre, a law to create a body of Gendarmerie to protect the Argentine borders, although the project would not ultimately succeed.

In 1916 the new president, Hipolito Yrigoyen, privately proposed the post of Minister of War, but Alvear rejected it. He then offered to be ambassador to France, a position he accepted and held until 1922. During the five years that the First World War lasted, Alvear carried out missions to help the allies in Paris, donating together with his wife Regina Pacini a war hospital and a blood bank, where Pacini was in charge of caring for the wounded. The funds for this were obtained thanks to the contacts that Alvear had. For example, when the French military officer Joseph Joffre suggested to the Argentine ambassador to install an Argentine pavilion in the university city of Paris, Alvear was able to pay for the work thanks to the contributions of Otto Bemberg. He also assisted in the negotiations for the sale of crops to the allies during the Great War. Here the first differences between Alvear and Yrigoyen appeared: when the latter argued that Argentina should maintain a neutral position, Alvear was in favor of the country declaring itself to the side of the Triple Entente.

== 1922 election ==

After the first radical government of Hipólito Yrigoyen, the problem of presidential succession arose. Faced with disputes within the party, in March 1922 the National Convention of the UCR, despite the episode of the commission in Geneva that aired the fact of ideological differences, Yrigoyen decided to support Alvear, at that time ambassador to France, and a member of the most conservative faction of the UCR, of patrician and landowning social origin, and with few ties to the popular base of the party.

The National Convention elected him a candidate in March 1922 by 139 votes to 33 (which brought together various candidates). The Alvear-González formula triumphed over the Piñero-Núñez binomial in the elections of 2 April 1922, imposing itself in all districts except for Corrientes, Salta and San Juan.

Alvear acceded to the presidency winning with 47.5% of the votes, or 419,172 votes. On 12 June, 235 radical voters out of 88 opponents consecrated Alvear, who still resided in France, as the Nation&#x27;s president.

The European governments saw with satisfaction the election of the new Argentine president, widely associated with the representative men of Western politics.

== Presidency ==

Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear assumed the presidency of Argentina on 12 October 1922, but his cabinet caused a bad impression among many radicals, since almost none of the ministers was in favor of the former president, although it was, in most cases, of personalities of recognized intellectual capacity. For this reason, the distance between Alvear and Yrigoyen began. Certain appointments of ministers were surprising, as was the case of Admiral Manuel Domecq García, fervent repressor of the striking demonstrations during the Yrigoyen government, as well as the appointment of General Agustín Justo.

The Argentine radio broadcast the ceremony of the transfer of command, and for the first time in the history of Argentina the voice of a president was heard on the radio. The Sunday following the inauguration, Alvear visited the Jockey Club. It had been six years since a president had not attended there, as Yrigoyen refused to do so. Alvear&#x27;s cabinet fully attended an interpellation in the Chamber of Deputies, when the ministers had not attended at least since 1919. On 1 May 1923 Alvear read the presidential speech. At 8:00 p.m., Alvear took his car and drove to the Constitución neighborhood to Yrigoyen&#x27;s house, who invited him to dinner.

=== Economic policy ===
The economic expansion that Argentina experienced during the period known as the radical republic (1916–1930), had an average annual expansion of 8.1%.His period of government began just when the postwar world crisis ended, which allowed the economy and finances to improve without major setbacks.

During his government, the Argentine economy reached the most prosperous situation it has ever had in its history: GDP per inhabitant for 1928 reached sixth place among the highest in the world, and income increased by almost 100,000,000 gold pesos. Furthermore, for three years the commercial exchange had been positive. These conditions occurred mainly thanks to the favorable external front: the reactivation after the First World War caused European countries to buy Argentine crops. For this reason, the Alvear government focused on agro-export policies, especially meat and cereals.

By 1925, Argentina covered 72% of world flax exports, 66% of corn, 50% of meat, 32% of oats, and 20% of wheat and flour. Industrial crops such as cotton also increased exponentially, from 2,000 hectares in 1914 to 122,000 in 1930. In addition, the area planted with yerba mate, peanuts, rice, grapes, sugar cane and tobacco grew.
In addition to the growth in agriculture, industrial development also spread – albeit to a lesser extent – installing in 1922 the first Ford automotive production plant in Latin America, with an investment of $240,000 for its construction. Just one year later, the state-owned YPF installed the first gasoline pump, on the corner of Bartolomé Mitre and Rosales, in the city of Buenos Aires. In 1925 the popular Ford T went on sale; after two years, production reached 100,000 units.

Starting in 1925, there was a huge increase in foreign investments from the United States, carried out through companies related to the refrigeration industry, with energy distribution and production organizations, and consumer goods. This sudden &quot;invasion&quot; of US capital created competition with capital from the UK. That rivalry was reflected in areas such as transportation, as the automotive products exported from the United States competed with the British railways. But competition with refrigeration companies linked to these two countries also intensified. These conflicts led to the deterioration of relations with the British.

=== Social policy ===

A number of reforms were carried out during Alvear&#x27;s presidency, amongst which included the creation of a Children&#x27;s Bureau, a law that ended night work for bakers, a law intended to protect women and children factory workers, legislation forcing the payment of salaries in money and not goods, and a pension plan for bank employees. Law No. 11,357, which was signed by the President on 22 September 1926, granted to women “(single, divorced or widowed) of legal age all the civil rights and functions which the law grants to men who have attained their majority&quot;. In 1926, the government started to take cognizance of agricultural cooperatives in 1926, with the Banco di la nacion legally empowered that year &quot;to grant financial assistance, arrange amortization of loans, and otherwise aid in the formation of cooperative societies&quot;. Law No. 11388 was also passed by the government, &quot;which officially recognized the cooperative movement and set forth regulations to guide the formation and operation of agricultural cooperatives&quot;. A decree was also signed approving regulations for mortgage loans by the Board of Directors of the Bank Employees&#x27; National Pension Fund. According to these regulations, loans from the Bank Employees&#x27; National Pension Fund &quot;may be made to bank employees who have served 10 years under the national retirement laws recognized by the banking institutions where they are employed&quot;.

=== International policy ===
During Alvear&#x27;s administration, border agreements were signed with Bolivia. An attempt was made to cancel the debt that Paraguay had with Argentina due to the War of the Triple Alliance. An attempt was also made to implement a tonnage limitation programme for warships alongside Chile.

On 30 October 1922, an act was signed between the Argentine ambassador Horacio Carrillo and the Bolivian chancellor Severo Fernández Alonso in which it was agreed to review the 1889 treaty to modify the border between both countries. In 1924, Román Paz assumed his position as the new Foreign Minister of Bolivia, for which reason the revision of the treaty had to be agreed upon between the Bolivian authority and Carrillo. Paz proposed that the city of Los Toldos remain in Bolivian rule. 

This discussion lasted all of 1924, until an agreement could be reached with the new Bolivian foreign minister in office, Eduardo Díez de Medina, who did not intend major changes in the limit. The Bolivian president agreed to modify some boundary line in order to compensate Argentina and seal the agreement. The Carrillo-Díez de Medina treaty was signed on 9 July 1925 and ceded the town of Yacuiba to Bolivia.

On 6 August 1924, celebrations and official entertainments were held on the occasion of the visit to the country of the crown prince to the throne of Italy, Umberto of Savoy. Alvear invited the future king to attend a parade of 25,000 children from Argentine public schools in the Congress Square.

The Government decided from 1922 to reject telephone and telegraphic postal correspondence to and from the Malvinas Islands in order to add concrete pressure to the diplomatic claim on the archipelago that was being occupied by the English. The government of the islands tried to alleviate the Argentine action by hiring steamers from Montevideo, and the British protest was not long in coming. Buenos Aires responded by alleging that the measure was not official, but that it was personal initiatives of the officials. In any case, by March 1928, communications with the islands were fully reestablished, after a clarification had been made that the resumption of service in no way implied renouncing the Argentine right to claim them.

During the V Pan American Conference meeting in Santiago de Chile in 1923, the host country proposed to Argentina to limit the arms race of both countries. The Chilean delegation accepted a first proposal from the United States of Brazil, which consisted of a limit of 80,000 tons for warships, but Argentina rejected it and responded with a counterproposal of 55,000 tons as a ceiling for warships. 

This new proposal did not succeed either, and for this reason diplomatic relations with Chile cooled down during the short administration of Chilean President Emiliano Figueroa. In addition, Chile was militarily rearmed in 1926, in response to what Argentina had done in 1924. There was another Chilean attempt at disarmament by the new president, Colonel Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, but it was also rejected by Argentina.

On 24 March 1925, the scientist Albert Einstein and his wife Elsa arrived in Argentina —in the framework of a tour also carried out by Brazil and Uruguay— to stay in the country for exactly one month. It was a remarkable fact that Einstein traveled to Argentina during that period, since with his visit he certified the good state that the country was going through at that time. The scientist, known worldwide for his theory of relativity, came to meet with the Argentine president. He had arrived at an invitation from the University of Buenos Aires and the Argentine Hebraic Society, and during his stay he gave twelve lectures, the vast majority explaining the new theory.

On 17 August, the Prince of Wales, Edward of Windsor, heir to the British crown, arrived in Argentina. As a result of his visit and the Maharaja of Kapurthala, Alvear organized an excursion to Huetel (in the partido of 25 May, province of Buenos Aires), to the estancia of Concepción Unzué de Casares (a kind of palace in the style of the France of Louis XIII) in the Argentine pampas, where they heard Carlos Gardel sing. Prince of Wales, the Maharaja of Kapurthala and Prince Umberto of Savoy produced an excess in the expenses foreseen for the events, whose total amount was around 500,000 pesos. Minister Víctor Molina informed the president that the amount has been spent and proposed to pass the expense to general income, but Alvear decided to take over the payment of half a million pesos, for which he had the subdivision and sale of part of his inherited lands in Don Torcuato.

=== Oil policy ===
One of the first actions of the Alvear government was to appoint General Enrique Mosconi as general director of Yacimiento Petrolifos Fiscales (YPF). Mosconi promoted YPF&#x27;s growth with government support, with the aim of achieving oil self-sufficiency, vital for the country&#x27;s autonomous development, and promoted measures to reduce competition between YPF and foreign companies. He managed the construction of the La Plata Industrial Complex, launched for oil refining in 1925, which made the country independent from the purchase of gasoline. Five months after its licensing, the production of gasoline for airplanes began. This industrial plant was the tenth largest distillery in the world.

During his eight years in office, Mosconi almost tripled oil production, from 348,888 cubic meters in 1922 to 872,171 cubic meters in 1929. The state oil company YPF inaugurated the first kerosene pump on 22 February 1923 in Buenos Aires; three months later another six were installed. On 20 June, the first gasoline pump for vehicles was built in Mitre and Rosales Avenue, manufactured by the industrialist Torcuato Di Tella after consulting with his friend, General Mosconi. YPF had fifty thousand employees. Both oil and self-sufficiency became campaign issues during the year 1928, when oil exploitation began in the province of Salta; in 1933 oil would be discovered in Tranquitas, in the same province.

=== Public and cultural works ===
During this administration, a large number of monuments and public and private works were built; Unlike his predecessor, Alvear always tried to be present at ceremonies, inaugurations and all kinds of social events. Regarding public works, the construction of the Ministry of Finance, Public Works, War and Navy and the building of the National Bank in Plaza de Mayo began. It also promoted culture, with the construction of theaters, museums and various artistic institutions. According to various historians, more public works were inaugurated during his tenure than during that of any of his predecessors, and as many official ceremonies were held with the participation of the Head of State as had never been seen before.

In 1923 the Luján Museum was inaugurated. In the city of Buenos Aires the mayor Carlos Noel had an outstanding mandate; His works included the completion of the Paseo de la Costanera Sur, the construction of ovens for the incineration of garbage, and the purchase of the Lezica farm to build the Rivadavia park. Noel also had many streets of the city paved.

In 1923 the president sent to the National Congress a project to form a national delegation to participate in the 1924 Paris Olympic Games, but the initiative did not prosper. On 31 December of that year, a decree was signed creating the Argentine Olympic Committee and thus the concurrence of Argentina to the Olympic Games was resolved, counting to cover the expenses with 250,000 pesos from an amount not collected in the National Lottery, with based on law 11 067. Thus, the first official participation in the Olympic Games by Argentina took place in 1924.

At the initiative of his wife, Regina Pacini, and motivated by the memories of the difficult times their parents had to go through, it occurred to him to found an institution that would protect them. He debated the idea with Enrique García Velloso and Angelina Pagano, among others, and called on theater entrepreneurs and artists. On 30 December 1927, the Deliberative Council granted the concession of a site for fifty years located in Santa Fe in 1200, while the Colón Theater gave special functions to raise funds; at the evening held at the Colón Beniamino Gigli and Claudia Muzzio sang. This is how the Casa del Teatro was born. Similarly, at the initiative of Pacini, Alvear authorized by decree the creation of the Municipal Radio 710 KHz, officially dedicated to broadcasting the season of operas and concerts from the Colón Theater, so that people who could not attend the theater could listen to classical music. The first broadcast was on 23 May and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Rigoletto&quot; was broadcast.

=== The division of radicalism ===

The division of the radical party became inevitable in 1923: nine radical senators declared themselves &quot;anti-personalists,&quot; that is, against Yrigoyen&#x27;s personalism, and gave their support to President Alvear.

There were also frictions between him and his vice president Elpidio González, since the latter was a Yrigoyenista; In fact, the division began when the senators began to harass Vice President González. Yrigoyenismo took the antipersonalists as conservatives, while the antipersonalists considered that Yrigoyen violated the rules of the political game. These disputes continued and, what was worse, they moved to Congress, where the deputies loyal to Yrigoyen came to obstruct several of the initiatives that emerged from the Executive Power, either through discussions or by withdrawing from the premises to avoid giving a quorum. In this context, in January 1925 President Alvear closed the extraordinary sessions by decree, as legislative activity was almost nil.

== 1928 election ==

The Radical Civic Union was divided into two political parties as the presidential elections of 1928 approached: on the one hand, the followers of Yrigoyen, called &quot;personalistas&quot;, promoted the leader himself as a candidate for president of the nation together with Francisco Beiró; On the other hand, the UCRA presented the Leopoldo Melo-Vicente Gallo formula, while the conservatives led by Julio A. Roca decided to abstain and support the antipersonnelists.

Yrigoyen&#x27;s victory in the 1928 elections was overwhelming: with 62% of the votes, he was again elected president. When Alvear went to transfer command to him on 12 October, his supporters began to threaten him, shouting &quot;¡traitor! ”, at which Alvear pounced on them ready to start a fight; but some people held him back to avoid a pitched battle. Alvear tried to shorten distances with Yrigoyen, and visited him in December 1928, after several years without seeing the caudillo.

== Later life ==

Once his government ended, Alvear settled in 1930 in Paris, a city that he was passionate about personally. Installed in Europe, his relatives sent him letters from Argentina explaining the chaotic situation in which the country&#x27;s politics was, such as the deteriorated figure of Hipólito Yrigoyen. This is how he learned about the coup d&#x27;état by José Félix Uriburu. This fact had not surprised him, since the economic crisis of 1929 and the lack of reaction on the part of an elderly and ill Yrigoyen had rapidly deteriorated his power. During the period from 1928 until the coup occurred in 1930, Alvear was informed of the Argentine political situation only through the numerous letters sent to him by his friends – in most cases from the anti-personalists most opposed to Yrigoyen. – which for the most part described to him a much more chaotic situation than it really was.

He made stern public statements about the personalist deviation from radicalism and about the character of the radical third government; He returned to the country under the impulse of duty, to put his personal influence at the service of the regrouping of the various fractions of radicalism, when he understood that the men of 6 September intended to govern without the consecration of the people, thereby altering the structures democratic institutions for which he had fought for more than forty years.

=== Return to Argentina ===
On 11 April 1931 Alvear embarked for Buenos Aires, where he arrived on 25 April, received at the port by some 6000 people, among whom were General Justo and an aide representing the de facto president José Félix Uriburu. Alvear he met with Uriburu, who told the radical leader that he could regain the presidency, as long as he guaranteed that there were no Yrigoyenists on his list; but Alvear rejected that proposal and began the efforts to unify the radicalism around his figure.

On 20 July 1931 a revolution broke out in the province of Corrientes, led by Lieutenant Colonel Gregorio Pomar. Although it was quickly repressed, it gave Uriburu the excuse he was looking for: the government denounced the existence of a terrorist plan and ordered the raid on the radical premises, which forced several political leaders, including Alvear himself, to go into exile from the country .

At 10 p.m. on 28 July 1931, he went into exile, one day after having drawn up a manifesto that the dictatorship prohibited him from publishing, and which he therefore had to spread clandestinely.

When Yrigoyen died in July 1933, he was recognized as the undisputed leader of radicalism. He governed the party as he had governed the country: respectful of its organic statute, of the district autonomies, of the personality of its members, giving an example of conciliation.

=== 1937 Presidential election ===

The committee&#x27;s office of 2 January 1935 decided to lift the electoral abstention. The initiative was approved with 98 votes to 49, and radicalism thus began to run in elections to elect national governors and deputies, some fraudulent and others not. In some electoral contests, radicalism emerged victorious, as was the case with the province of Entre Ríos in the 1935 elections, for which Alvear campaigned for the first time, visiting a large number of towns and giving several speeches a day. But he himself was beginning to be criticized as an accomplice of the Justista electoral regime. For this reason, during 1935 the Yrigoyen and intransigent leaders began to gather, criticizing the Alvearista leadership. But by 1936 Alvearismo led the party with almost no internal resistance, since Alvear&#x27;s harsh character – labeled as dictatorial by some leaders – led to the abandonment of internal critics.

Radicalism managed to win in the provincial elections of November 1935, and in the elections of March of the following year, in which eighty-two seats of deputies were renewed, Alvear went out to campaign in the provinces of the coast and north of Argentina. In those of Santa Fe, Mendoza, Salta and Buenos Aires (the latter to a lesser extent) the elections were victims again of the same vices, although in the remaining elections the elections were carried out relatively normally; thus, radicalism managed to win in the provinces of Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Entre Ríos.

On 12 February 1937 Alvear met with President Justo with the idea that he would guarantee him an electoral act clean of fraud; It was the first time they had seen each other since 1931. The following day, the Interior Minister called Alvear and told him that some points of the interview would be fulfilled, a fact that did not happen, since the Santa Fe elections were signed by the same vices.
On 28 May 1937, the presidential binomial was voted on at the Coliseo theater. Among the vice presidential candidates were Mosca, Pueyrredón, Güemes and Laurencena. Alvear unanimously won the candidacy for the presidency, while Mosca won the candidacy for the vice-presidency by 145 votes compared to the 24, 8 and 4 that Laurencena, Pueyrredón and Güemes obtained, respectively.

On 5 September 1937, an enthusiastic crowd gathered at Luna Park, acclaimed his name as a candidate for the presidency of the Nation. He was 69 years old. The presidential elections were held, in which the candidate of the Concordance Roberto M. Ortiz, a radical antipersonnel who had been Minister of Public Works during the presidency of Alvear, triumphed; this managed to gather almost 42% of the votes, although it only obtained 127 voters against 245 for Ortiz. The radicalism made several denunciations of electoral fraud in most of the provinces, but Ortiz was proclaimed president. He was defeated in the elections, which were not free elections, but the result of pressure and fraud; but he did not faint from frustration and continued fighting for the Constitution and democracy.

The fact that Alvear and Ortiz died respectively in March and July 1942 meant that neither of the two main candidates in the election survived long enough to see the end of the presidential term they contested.

During the last years of his life, he made party tours throughout the country. In political events he was accompanied by young radicals who later became prominent party politicians, such as Ricardo Balbín and Crisologo Larralde.

=== Last years and death ===

By the end of the 1930s, Alvear&#x27;s health had deteriorated, as a result of a flu from which it was difficult for him to recover and the political situation that the country was experiencing in those years. During a meeting of the National Committee, the surprise resignation of Alvear was read, made to leave the way to Tamborini clear. A delegation went to his home in Don Torcuato to inform him that the committee had rejected his resignation. Alvear could not receive them due to his delicate state of health, but with his secretary as an intermediary, he thanked them for the visit with the conclusion that &quot;I am very ill, with one foot in the grave.&quot;

On 23 March 1942, struck down by a heart attack, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear died next to his wife Regina Pacini at their home in Don Torcuato. A significant number of people moved to the town to say goodbye to the old president, despite the fact that it had rained for much of the day. The following day he was transferred to the Casa Rosada and watched over by the &quot;official&quot; authorities, precisely by those who had closed his access to the presidency through electoral fraud. Several leaders who had won thanks to fraud, such as Roberto Marcelino Ortiz, Agustín Pedro Justo and Rodolfo Moreno, gave Alvear words of praise.

During his funeral, incidents occurred when a crowd of people forcibly stole the coffin from the official funeral liturgy held at the Casa Rosada; the coffin was carried by the people chanting slogans against the government to the Recoleta Cemetery. His remains are in the family mausoleum of the Recoleta Cemetery, together with those of his grandfather Carlos María de Alvear and his father Torcuato de Alvear, next to the grave of Juan Facundo Quiroga. The mausoleum was designed by the architect Alejandro Christophersen in 1905.

== Tribute and legacy ==

He is considered by many to be a good president, who knew how to lead Argentina on the path of progress in the brilliant years of the 1920s. The cartoonists used to caricature the corpulent figure of Alvear in several of the situations, such as his attempt to correctly accommodate himself in an armchair, since the president was forced to turn his chair to do so and thus be able to cross his long legs; or hurriedly leaving Congress to go to the beach at Mar del Plata or vice versa, referring to his habit of spending vacations in that city. His patience in the face of the exhausting division that shook radicalism was also a common point of several humorists of the time. The cartoonists baptized him as the &quot;bald man&quot;, in &quot;opposition&quot; to the &quot;hairy one&quot; that was Hipólito Yrigoyen.

The newspaper La Prensa paid tribute to Alvear&#x27;s personality:Last night the life of a citizen who rendered eminent services to the country and who was an example of civic virtues through half a century of public performance was extinguished. Alvear knew, in short, the satisfactions, concerns and bitterness that the exercise of public functions and political activities provide; he showed, in his tireless dedication, in an incessant approach to the fundamental problems of the country and in his fervent preaching of democratic principles, which both since the level as from the highest positions it is possible to be useful to the country when it is loved dearly and only its good is pursued.
One of the first tributes to Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear was the inauguration of the Presidente Alvear Theater, on 23 March 1942, a month after the death of the former president.

The father and geographer Alberto María de Agostini gave the name Sierra Alvear to a mountain range in the Andes Mountains, which includes the highest peaks in the Argentine part of the Island of Tierra del Fuego. On 23 March 2017, on the 75th anniversary of Alvear&#x27;s death, the UCR paid tribute to the former president at the Bicentennial Museum, where a space with objects of him was also inaugurated to remember his figure.

To this is added the wide number of towns and streets named in his honor and that of his family:

* Village Alvear, Santa Fe. 
* Department General Alvear, Buenos Aires (Province).
* Municipality and village General Alvear, Misiones.
* Department General Alvear, Mendoza.
* Department General Alvear, Corrientes.
* City Alvear, Corrientes.

<doc id="717811" wikidata="Q1970245" url="?curid=717811" title="The Beau Brummels">
<text>The Beau Brummels were an American rock band. Formed in San Francisco in 1964, the band&#x27;s original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). They were discovered by local disc jockeys who were looking to sign acts to their new label, Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewart—later known as Sly Stone—produced the group&#x27;s early recording sessions. Initially, the band&#x27;s musical style blended beat music and folk music and typically drew comparisons to the Beatles, while their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.

The Beau Brummels broke into the mainstream with their debut single, &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot;, for which they would later be credited with setting one of the aesthetic foundations for the San Francisco sound, along with other bands such as the Charlatans; the song is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. The band&#x27;s popularity continued with the subsequent album, 1965&#x27;s &quot;Introducing The Beau Brummels&quot;, and the Top 10 single &quot;Just a Little&quot;. The group&#x27;s commercial success declined by the following year, at which time the financially struggling Autumn label was acquired by Warner Bros. Records. After recording an album of cover songs, &quot;Beau Brummels &#x27;66&quot;, the band released a pair of critically acclaimed albums: &quot;Triangle&quot; in 1967 and &quot;Bradley&#x27;s Barn&quot; in 1968.

The band underwent several personnel changes, beginning with Mulligan&#x27;s departure in 1965. Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from a diabetic condition, leaving him unable to tour with the band. Shortly after the release of &quot;Beau Brummels &#x27;66&quot;, Irving left the group when he was inducted into the armed forces. Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre, reducing the Beau Brummels to a trio for the recording of &quot;Triangle&quot;. Meagher was drafted for military service in 1968, leaving Valentino and Elliott as the only remaining band members. The duo worked with prominent Nashville session musicians to record &quot;Bradley&#x27;s Barn&quot; before parting ways in 1969 to focus on solo material and participate in projects by other artists. Four of the original Beau Brummels re-formed in 1974 with one new member, and the band released a self-titled album the following year.

==History==
===Formation (1964)===
Sal Valentino grew up in the North Beach section of San Francisco. In early 1964, following a string of appearances as a singer on local television, Valentino received an offer to play a regular gig at El Cid, a San Francisco club. Needing a band, he called childhood friend and songwriter/guitarist Ron Elliott, who recruited drummer John Petersen, rhythm guitarist/singer Declan Mulligan, and bassist Ron Meagher. Victor Savant, later to achieve fame in Europe as musical director for schlager singer Roberto Blanco, was in the band for a brief period as a pianist, but never recorded with the band. The gig led to a more lucrative deal at the Morocco Room, a club in nearby San Mateo, California. Meanwhile, San Francisco disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell were looking for new acts to bring to their fledgling Autumn Records label. Donahue and Mitchell wanted to capitalize on the Beatlemania craze that originated the previous year in the UK and was spreading across the U.S. by this time. Rich Romanello, owner of the Morocco Room and the Brummels&#x27; first manager, asked Donahue and Mitchell to see the band perform at the club. Romanello recalled, &quot;There were maybe four people in the place, and they set up and started playing, and that old hair on my arm goes up. And when the hair on your arm goes up, you got something. It was a big change, to go from saxophones and black singers to a white guitar sound, but I hired &#x27;em.&quot;
The Beau Brummels signed with Autumn, where house producer Sylvester Stewart—later known as Sly Stone, of Sly and the Family Stone fame—produced the group&#x27;s early recording sessions.

The Beau Brummels took their name from the Regency era English dandy Beau Brummell. The group liked having a British-sounding name, and the legend has been, since it so closely followed The Beatles in the alphabet, the group also knew their records would likely be placed immediately behind those of The Beatles in record-store bins.
Valentino dismissed this notion in a 2008 interview with &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine. &quot;That&#x27;s a total myth&quot;, he said. &quot;We just needed a name, and that sounded good. We didn&#x27;t even know how to spell it. Everybody now has a notion of what people were thinking back then, but we never thought of those kinds of things.&quot; Al Hazan, who produced the band&#x27;s demo recording, noted, &quot;I never thought of the Brummels in terms of the Beatles—it was Ron Elliott&#x27;s talent as a songwriter that caused me to want to produce them.&quot;

===&quot;Introducing the Beau Brummels&quot; and &quot;The Beau Brummels, Volume 2&quot; (1965)===

The band&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot; entered the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart in January 1965, making them the first successful San Francisco rock band of the 1960s. As the song climbed the charts, many listeners assumed The Beau Brummels were British, due to the band&#x27;s name and musical style, which recalled such bands as The Beatles and The Zombies.
The comparisons were bolstered by Donahue and Mitchell, who had the band dress in Beatlesque suits and spread rumors that the band was indeed British.
&quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot; peaked at number 15 in February,
but Donahue believed the single would have gone to number one if the band was on a label with stronger distribution. The song was the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in Canada, where it reached number two on the Canadian Singles Chart. The band&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Just a Little&quot;, became the band&#x27;s highest-charting single in the U.S., peaking at number eight in June. Both songs were included on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Introducing the Beau Brummels&quot;, which was released in April and reached number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart.
The band appeared as themselves and performed in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie &quot;Village of the Giants&quot;, (which was later featured in a 1994 episode of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;).
The band appeared as &quot;The Beau Brummelstones&quot; on &quot;The Flintstones&quot; television animated sitcom in the season six episode &quot;Shinrock A Go-Go&quot;, which originally aired on December 3, 1965.

When recording began for the band&#x27;s second album, 1965&#x27;s &quot;The Beau Brummels, Volume 2&quot;, Mulligan was no longer a member of the group. In 1966 Mulligan filed an unsuccessful lawsuit, claiming he was wrongfully dismissed from the group. &quot;You Tell Me Why&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, was the band&#x27;s third and final U.S. top 40 hit, peaking at number 38 in August 1965. Another single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot;, reached number 52 in November. While Stone is credited as the album&#x27;s producer, his involvement, according to Sal Valentino and Ron Elliott, had diminished to the point that the band does not recall any producer being in charge. By the end of the year, Elliott began to suffer seizures from his diabetic condition that left him unable to perform.
Don Irving became Elliott&#x27;s stand-in on guitar when the group performed live, and also recorded with them.

===&quot;Beau Brummels &#x27;66&quot;, &quot;Triangle&quot; and &quot;Bradley&#x27;s Barn&quot; (1966–68)===
The Beau Brummels made a musical guest appearance performing &quot;Just Wait and See&quot; in &quot;Wild Wild Winter&quot; (actually filmed in 1965, before &quot;Village of the Giants&quot; and when Mulligan was still in the band) a beach party-inspired comedy film by Universal Pictures which was released January 5, 1966. The band continued recording new material despite Autumn verging on collapse. Such songs as &quot;I Grow Old&quot;, &quot;Gentle Wandering Ways&quot; and &quot;Dream On&quot;, along with Valentino-composed tracks such as &quot;Love Is Just a Game&quot;, &quot;This Is Love&quot;, and &quot;Hey, Love&quot;, would have most likely been included on the band&#x27;s third album for Autumn. But before an album was completed and released, the entire Autumn roster, including the Beau Brummels, was transferred to Warner Bros. Records. Warner Bros., however, did not control the band&#x27;s publishing, and consequently the company chose not to have the band release an album of original material. The unreleased songs were later included on the 2005 three-disc compilation album &quot;San Fran Sessions&quot;. Instead, Warner Bros. opted to have the band record an album of cover songs. Released in July 1966, &quot;Beau Brummels &#x27;66&quot; was considered a commercial and critical disappointment. The non-album single &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, a Bob Dylan cover, was the band&#x27;s sixth and final Hot 100 chart entry, peaking at number 95 in June. Petersen left the band after the album&#x27;s release to join Harpers Bizarre,
while Irving departed when he received an induction notice into the armed forces.
The three remaining members quit touring to focus on studio work.

The band resumed writing original material for their fourth album, &quot;Triangle&quot;, produced by Lenny Waronker. Session musicians, such as Van Dyke Parks, who played harpsichord on &quot;Magic Hollow&quot;, contributed to the album.
Released in July 1967, &quot;Triangle&quot; only reached number 197 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, but it was praised by critics, including Australian journalist and author Lillian Roxon in her 1969 &quot;Rock Encyclopedia&quot;. In 1968, Meagher was drafted for military service, leaving the Beau Brummels as a duo consisting of Valentino and Elliott.
The duo went to Tennessee to record their fifth album, and worked with prominent Nashville session musicians such as Kenny Buttrey, a drummer on Bob Dylan&#x27;s albums from 1966 to 1969, and guitarist Jerry Reed. The Beau Brummels were so pleased with the results at the studio that they named the album &quot;Bradley&#x27;s Barn&quot;, after the studio in which it was recorded.
Shortly following the album&#x27;s release in October 1968, the Beau Brummels split up.

===Solo works, other projects and reformation (1969–2013)===

Following a stint in 1969 recording solo singles for Warner Bros. Records, Valentino assembled a new band, Stoneground, which was associated with the hippie commune the Hog Farm in the early 1970s.
The band broke up in 1973 after releasing three albums. Elliott, who in 1968 played guitar on Van Dyke Parks&#x27; debut album, &quot;Song Cycle&quot;, and arranged The Everly Brothers&#x27; album, &quot;Roots&quot;, released a solo album, &quot;The Candlestickmaker&quot;, in 1970. During the early 1970s, Elliott produced albums by Levitt &amp; McClure and Pan, and played on albums by Van Morrison, Randy Newman and Little Feat. Meanwhile, Mulligan and Meagher were members of the Black Velvet Band. In 1969, Petersen married Roberta Templeman, sister of Harpers Bizarre&#x27;s Ted Templeman.
Petersen remained with Harper&#x27;s Bizarre until the band broke up in the early 1970s.

In February 1974, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that the Beau Brummels had reformed in San Francisco.
The band resumed touring, and a 1974 performance recorded in Fair Oaks Village near Sacramento, California was released in 2000 as the &quot;Live!&quot; album.
In April 1975, the band released a self-titled studio album, which reached number 180 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. One of the band&#x27;s previous singles, 1965&#x27;s &quot;You Tell Me Why&quot;, was re-recorded for the album.

Although the band split up again soon after the album&#x27;s release, the Beau Brummels continued to work in various incarnations from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s, including shows with The Smithereens, and often appeared in tandem with Dinosaurs, the psychedelic-era &quot;supergroup&quot;.
The band also performed at shows such as the Baypop 2000 Festival
and the 2002 Summer of Love Festival, both in San Francisco.
In 2006, Valentino released &quot;Dreamin&#x27; Man&quot;, the first solo album of his 50-year career.
Another album, &quot;Come Out Tonight&quot;, followed later that year, and his third solo album, &quot;Every Now and Then&quot;, was released in 2008.
John Petersen died of a heart attack on November 11, 2007.

The remaining original band members reunited to record a studio album, &quot;Continuum&quot;, released in March 2013 on Bay Sound Records. The album features drum tracks that were recorded in 1965 by Petersen and contains 15 songs written by Elliott, along with re-recordings of &quot;Just a Little&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk to Strangers&quot;, and &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot;.

==Musical style==
Combining beat music and folk rock,
the Beau Brummels were most often compared, especially early in their career, to British bands such as the Beatles and the Zombies. The Beau Brummels were fans of these acts as well as The Rolling Stones and The Searchers, and originally patterned their overall style after the British Invasion sound.
The melancholy, minor keys of debut single &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot; led many listeners mistakenly to believe that the band were indeed British.
As the band evolved, they incorporated different music genres into their works, ranging from hard rock to country and western to rhythm and blues.
The &quot;Triangle&quot; album exhibited the band&#x27;s growing interest in country music along with elements of psychedelic pop, including the use of strings, brass, woodwinds, harpsichord, and various types of unique percussion. Ron Elliott said the album was &quot;sort of a mood swing into the world that was around us at the time. It was sort of dissolving into this drug culture. So the music became very ethereal, mystic, and mysterious.&quot; The band&#x27;s country rock fusion was most evident on their 1968 album &quot;Bradley&#x27;s Barn&quot;, which Elliott said was similar stylistically to &quot;Triangle&quot;, but with more country accents.

The band members have been hesitant to categorize their music, preferring to call it a combination of styles, according to Elliott.
&quot;We don&#x27;t play anything really different—we play melodically and rhythmically&quot;, he said in a 1965 interview. &quot;I think that&#x27;s why the [Rolling] Stones have made it. They don&#x27;t do anything really fantastic but they have good taste, and good taste is more important than speed.&quot; Sal Valentino praised Elliott&#x27;s vocal style, saying that &quot;Ron had a great low register. He knew how to write in the best keys for me.&quot; Valentino added, &quot;From the time I started singing in bands, I didn&#x27;t really sing too many other people&#x27;s songs other than Ron&#x27;s. Being able to sing just one person&#x27;s writing, who was a pretty able writer with ability to adjust to what he&#x27;s working with, had a lot to do with the way I sang.&quot; Valentino also credited Sly Stone&#x27;s input for the band&#x27;s early success. &quot;He had a lot to do with making our music relatable and anticipating how our records would sound on the radio, particularly on the bottom, rhythm end. Sly was very motivated to make a lot of money, and he was awfully talented.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Beau Brummels are considered the first band from a burgeoning San Francisco music scene to achieve widespread success in response to the British Invasion, standing out among such bands as The Charlatans, Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, We Five, Moby Grape, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Country Joe and the Fish. At the height of the band&#x27;s popularity, the Beau Brummels were regarded as teen idols, appearing on several television music variety shows including &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, as well as the teen films &quot;Village of the Giants&quot; and &quot;Wild Wild Winter&quot;. The band also appeared as the Beau Brummelstones in a 1965 episode of the animated television sitcom &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. The band pioneered blending beat music with folk rock, as &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot; was recorded before The Byrds recorded &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. The group&#x27;s &quot;Triangle&quot; (1967) and &quot;Bradley&#x27;s Barn&quot; (1968) albums are considered early examples in the country rock music genre.

&quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot; was included on the 1998 reissue of &quot;&quot;, a compilation double album of American garage rock singles that helped influence the development of 1970s punk rock.
The song was also featured during a scene in the 1989 comedy-drama film &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;, starring John Candy. In 1994, &quot;Laugh, Laugh&quot; was named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s exhibit showcasing The 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.
In the June 1997 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, &quot;Magic Hollow&quot; was selected as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Psychedelic Classics&quot;. Music journalist and author Tom Moon named &quot;Triangle&quot; to his 2008 book of the &quot;1,001 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Lawrence Technological University (Lawrence Tech, LTU) is a private university in Southfield, Michigan. It was founded in 1932 in Highland Park, Michigan, as the Lawrence Institute of Technology (LIT) by Russell E. Lawrence. The university moved to Southfield in 1955 and has since expanded to . The campus also includes the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Affleck House in Bloomfield Hills. The university offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral programs through its five colleges.

== History ==
In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, Lawrence Tech&#x27;s founding president Russell E. Lawrence envisioned a new model of higher education that could serve both traditional students as well as working adults, and combined a teaching philosophy espousing both theory and practice.

Lawrence believed engineering and technological achievements would be what would spur economic recovery, both for the region and the nation. Henry and Edsel Ford agreed to lease their former Henry Ford Trade School building, a part of their Model-T assembly complex in Highland Park, to the new university, which began operations with a few hundred students. The institution&#x27;s enrollment dropped during World War II but surged immediately thereafter as veterans enjoyed the education benefits of the G.I. Bill.

In 1955, Lawrence Institute of Technology (LIT) moved to a campus in then rural Southfield. Since the university was founded as an engineering school, it is fitting that the first building constructed on the Southfield campus was the Engineering building. The campus master plan was created by professor Earl W. Pellerin, who also led the teams that designed the Architecture and Science Buildings, the university&#x27;s first residence hall on Ten Mile Road, University Housing-South, and what was originally the president&#x27;s residence on nearby Circle Drive.

LIT began offering multiple master&#x27;s degree programs through its colleges, and in recognition of these post-baccalaureate programs LIT changed it name to Lawrence Technological University (LTU) on 1 January 1989.

LTU continued its transformation from a primarily commuter institution to offering a full campus life with the construction of more residence halls—Donley Hall, Reuss Hall, and East Residence Hall, the latter for all first-year students. The university now has the capacity for more than 1,000 residential students.

A marker designating the college as a Michigan Historic Site was erected by the Michigan Historical Commission in 1986. The inscription reads:

Lawrence Tech was chartered in 1932 by the Lawrence brothers, Russell E. and E. George. The college was located in Highland Park on Woodward Avenue until 1955, when the first building opened on this campus. Lawrence Tech, founded as an undergraduate college of engineering, later added programs in architecture, management, arts and science, and various technological fields. The college pioneered in scheduling evening programs for working students and in 1935 developed the four-quarter academic calendar. &quot;Theory and Practice&quot; has been the motto of the college since its founding. Application of classroom theories to real situations involving the community or Michigan industries has been its goal. Lawrence Institute of Technology is a nonprofit independent college.

===Academic divisions===

The university offers more than 100 academic programs through its five Colleges, Architecture and Design, Arts and Sciences, Business and Information Technology, Engineering, and Health Sciences.

In 1950, associate degree programs were added to LTU&#x27;s baccalaureate programs and in 1952, what is today the College of Business and Information Technology was established. LTU started offering multiple master&#x27;s degree programs from the early 1990s. Master&#x27;s degree programs in business were created in 1989, engineering in 1990, Architecture in 1993 and arts and sciences in 1997. Its most popular undergraduate majors, in terms of 2021 graduates, were:
::Mechanical Engineering (68)
::Architectural and Building Sciences/Technology (46)
::Electrical and Electronics Engineering (43)
::Computer Science (41)

The College of Business and Information Technology is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Founded in 1916, AACSB is the longest serving global accrediting body for business schools. Only 6 percent of the world’s 16,000 institutions of higher learning offering business degrees have earned its accreditation. Lawrence Tech first earned its accreditation in 2016, and a five-year extension was granted in February 2024.

Lawrence Tech added a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program in partnership with Ascension Michigan in 2017. In 2021, the program earned full accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education through June 2026. LTU also added a two-year Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies program in 2021, and that program has received provisional accreditation. See https://www.arc-pa.org/accreditation-history-lawrence-technological-university/ Finally, LTU launched a Master of Science in Cardiovascular Perfusion program in fall 2022. The nursing and physician assistant programs reside in the College of Health Sciences, which LTU established in 2023. The perfusion program remains in the College of Engineering under a contractual agreement with an industry partner, but is affiliated with the new college. LTU is currently studying adding further healthcare certificate and degree programs.

===Rankings===
In its 2024 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Lawrence Tech as tied for #53 in &quot;Regional Universities Midwest&quot;, a move down from #33 in the previous year. LTU also made U.S. News’ Best Value Colleges, Best Colleges for Veterans, and Top Performers for Social Mobility lists among its peer group of Midwestern universities. Lawrence Tech is also included in &quot;The Best 389 Colleges 2024 edition,&quot; a publication listing the nation&#x27;s top colleges and universities published by Princeton Review Inc., an independent college admissions services, test preparation, and tutoring company.

== Athletics ==


The Lawrence Tech athletic teams are called the Blue Devils. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Wolverine–Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) for most of its sports since the 2012–13 academic year; while the university&#x27;s second men&#x27;s ice hockey team is a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) at the Division III level as a member of the Michigan Collegiate Hockey Conference (MCHC); and its football team competes in the Mideast League of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA). The Blue Devils previously competed as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) during the 2011–12 school year (when the school re-instated back its athletics program).

Lawrence Tech competes in 26 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey (D-I and D-III), lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

=== History ===
Lawrence Tech fielded athletic teams throughout its history from 1930 to 1962. The 1950–51 men&#x27;s basketball team played the 1951 National Invitation Tournament, held at Madison Square Garden in New York.
Lawrence Tech was defeated by Dayton, 71–77 in the opening round of the tournament. Blaine Denning, an alumnus from the 1951 team, went on to play professional basketball with the Baltimore Bullets of the NBA.

Lawrence Tech reinstated athletic programs in 2011 and joined the NAIA. Men&#x27;s soccer and bowling, along with women&#x27;s volleyball, joined the already established men&#x27;s ice hockey team for the university&#x27;s athletic offerings during the 2011–12 academic year. During its fifth season in the NAIA, the university fielded teams in men&#x27;s baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, hockey, volleyball, lacrosse, soccer and tennis, and women&#x27;s basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

Thanks to a $1 million gift from an anonymous donor, during the summer of 2016 Lawrence Tech constructed an AstroTurf surface athletic field at the Point, the part of campus at the intersection of Northwestern Highway and 10 Mile Road. LTU&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer and lacrosse teams began playing on this field in August 2016. The project also includes a 40-car parking lot. In the summer of 2018, lighting for night games, a new scoreboard with a video replay display, temporary seating for 2,000 fans and a press box were constructed in preparation for the inaugural 2018 season of LTU&#x27;s football team. The first football game, held Sept. 1, 2018, drew an overflow crowd of more than 3,800 fans. Future plans for the site include permanent stadium seating for 4,000 fans, a two-story team building with locker rooms, a weight room, and offices for trainers and coaches, and a concession and restroom building.

In January 2017, Lawrence Tech announced that it would resume intercollegiate football competition, after a hiatus of more than 70 years dating back to just after World War II. The university admitted two recruiting classes of about 90 student-athletes for a team that competed as an independent squad in the fall of 2018, and which began playing a full varsity schedule in the Mid-States Football Association of the NAIA in the fall of 2019. LTU&#x27;s first head coach was Jeff Duvendeck. The Blue Devils finished 5–3 in their abbreviated first season, and attracted nearly 4,000 fans to their first game on Sept. 1, 2018. The 2021 LTU football squad finished 7-4 overall, 3–4 in the Mid-States Football Association.

In 2021, the university added more teams, including eSports, women&#x27;s hockey, cheerleading and men&#x27;s volleyball, and adding to existing programs in women&#x27;s bowling and track and field. LTU now supports over 30 varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams in baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, eSports, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball—along with a pep band, a marching band, and cheer and dance teams.

In 2024 Men&#x27;s Hockey DIII won the ACHA national championship defeating GVS 4-2.

<text>In physics, a non-Gaussianity is the correction that modifies the expected Gaussian function estimate for the measurement of a physical quantity.

In physical cosmology, the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background are known to be approximately Gaussian, both theoretically as well as experimentally. However, most theories predict some level of non-Gaussianity in the primordial density field. Detection of these non-Gaussian signatures will allow discrimination between various models of inflation and their alternatives.

<doc id="717829" wikidata="Q477374" url="?curid=717829" title="Eggnog">
<text>Eggnog (), historically also known as a [[milk punch]] or an egg milk punch when alcoholic beverages are added, is a rich, chilled, sweetened, dairy-based beverage traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, egg yolk and whipped egg white (which gives it a frothy texture, and its name). A distilled spirit such as brandy, rum, whiskey or bourbon is often a key ingredient.

Throughout North America, Australia and some European countries, eggnog is traditionally consumed over the Christmas season, from early November to late December. A variety called Ponche Crema has been made and consumed in the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Trinidad since the 1900s, also as part of the Christmas season. During that time, commercially prepared eggnog is sold in grocery stores in these countries.

Eggnog is also homemade using milk, eggs, sugar, and flavourings, and served with cinnamon or nutmeg. While eggnog is often served chilled, in some cases it is warmed, particularly on cold days (similar to the way mulled wine is served warm). Eggnog or eggnog flavouring may also be added to other drinks, such as coffee (e.g., an &quot;eggnog latte&quot; espresso drink) and tea, or to dessert foods such as egg-custard puddings.

==Terminology==
&quot;The Modern Bartender&#x27;s Guide&quot; from 1878 lists many variant names for the drink. It distinguishes &quot;plain eggnog,&quot; &quot;egg milk punch,&quot; and &quot;milk punch&quot; from one another. It also includes variants such as &quot;Baltimore eggnog,&quot; &quot;General Jackson eggnog,&quot; &quot;Imperial eggnog,&quot; two types of &quot;sherry cobbler eggnog,&quot; as well as &quot;sherry cobbler with egg,&quot; &quot;mulled claret with egg,&quot; &quot;egg sour,&quot; and &quot;Saratoga egg lemonade&quot; (also called &quot;sea breeze&quot;).

==History==
===Etymology and origins===
The origins, etymology, and the ingredients used to make original eggnog drinks are debated.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, &quot;nog&quot; was &quot;a kind of strong beer brewed in East Anglia&quot;. The first known use of the word &quot;nog&quot; was in 1693. Alternatively, &quot;nog&quot; may stem from &quot;noggin&quot;, a Middle English term for a small, carved wooden mug used to serve alcohol.

Posset, a curdled beverage of milk and either wine or ale, was a popular beverage in Britain that may have been a precursor to eggnog. Some monks would add eggs and figs to posset. However, the British drink was also called an &quot;egg flip&quot;, from the practice of &quot;flipping&quot; (rapidly pouring) the mixture between two pitchers to mix it. One dictionary lists the word &quot;eggnog&quot; as being an Americanism invented in 1765–75.

Babson College professor Frederick Douglass Opie contends that the term derives from two colonial slang words: &quot;grog&quot; (rum) that bartenders served in &quot;noggins&quot; (small wooden mugs). From here came &quot;egg and grog&quot;, then &quot;egg-n-grog&quot;, and finally the portmanteau &quot;eggnog&quot;. Barry Popik disputes the &quot;egg and grog&quot; theory on the basis that there is absolutely no evidence to support it.

Another suggestion is that &quot;nog&quot; is related to the Scottish term &quot;nugg&quot; or &quot;nugged ale&quot;, meaning &quot;ale warmed with a hot poker.&quot;

The &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; states that &quot;eggnog&quot; was an American neologism of 1775, a compound of &quot;egg&quot; and &quot;nog&quot;, the latter term meaning &quot;strong ale&quot;.

The earliest documented example of &quot;eggnog&quot; dates to 1775, when Maryland clergyman and philologist Jonathan Boucher wrote a poem about the drink: &quot;Fog-drams i&#x27; th&#x27; morn, or (better still) egg-nogg, / At night hot-suppings, and at mid-day, grogg, / My palate can regale&quot;. Boucher&#x27;s verse was not, however, published until 30 years after his death, thus the word first appeared in print only in 1788, in the March 26 edition of the &quot;New-Jersey Journal&quot; in an article referring to a young man drinking a glass of eggnog. An 1869 dictionary entry for &quot;eggnog&quot; defines it as a mixture of wine, spirits, eggs and sugar; there is no mention of dairy products.

&quot;While culinary historians debate its exact lineage, most agree eggnog originated from the early medieval&quot; British drink called posset, which was made with hot milk that was curdled with wine or ale and flavored with spices. In the Middle Ages, posset was used as a cold and flu remedy. Posset was popular from medieval times to the 19th century. Eggs were added to some posset recipes; according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, by the &quot;13th century, monks were known to drink a posset with eggs and figs.&quot; A 17th century recipe for &quot;My Lord of Carlisle&#x27;s Sack-Posset&quot; uses a heated mixture of cream, whole cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, eighteen egg yolks, eight egg whites, and one pint of Sack wine (a fortified white wine related to sherry). At the end, sugar, ambergris and animal musk are stirred in. Posset was traditionally served in two-handled pots. The aristocracy had costly posset pots made from silver.

Eggnog is not the only mixed, sweetened alcohol drink associated with the winter season. Mulled wine or wassail is a drink made by Ancient Greeks and Romans with sweetened, spiced wine. When the drink spread to Britain, the locals switched to the more widely available alcohol, hard cider, to make their mulled beverages. During the Victorian era, Britons drank purl, &quot;a heady mixture of gin, warm beer, sugar, bitter herbs, and spices&quot;. In the Colonial era in America, the drink was transformed into an &quot;ale-and-rum-based flip&quot; warmed with a hot poker.

===Development===

In Britain, the drink was originally popular among the aristocracy. &quot;Milk, eggs, and sherry were foods of the wealthy, so eggnog was often used in toasts to prosperity and good health.&quot; Those who could afford milk and eggs and costly spirits mixed the eggnog with brandy, Madeira wine or sherry to make a drink similar to modern alcoholic eggnog.

The drink crossed the Atlantic to the British colonies during the 18th century. Since brandy and wine were heavily taxed, rum from the Atlantic slave trade with the Caribbean was a cost-effective substitute. The inexpensive liquor, coupled with plentiful farm and dairy products available to colonists, helped the drink become very popular in America. When the supply of rum to the newly founded United States was reduced as a consequence of the American Revolutionary War, Americans turned to domestic whiskey, and eventually bourbon in particular, as a substitute. In places in the American colonies where even bourbon was too expensive, homemade moonshine spirits were added to eggnog. Eggnog &quot;became tied to the holidays&quot; when it was adopted in the United States in the 1700s. Eggnog &quot;seems to have been popular on both sides of the Atlantic&quot; in the 18th century.

Records show that the first US president, George Washington, &quot;served an eggnog-like drink to visitors&quot; which included &quot;rye whiskey, rum, and sherry.&quot; The President&#x27;s recipe called for a variety of alcoholic beverages along with the dairy and egg ingredients: &quot;One quart cream, one quart milk, one dozen tablespoons sugar, one pint brandy, 1/2 pint rye whiskey, 1/2 pint Jamaica rum, [and] 1/4 pint sherry.&quot; The recipe instructs cooks to &quot;mix [the] liquor first, then separate yolks and whites of eggs, add sugar to beaten yolks, mix well. Add milk and cream, slowly beating. Beat whites of eggs until stiff and fold slowly into mixture. Let set in cool place for several days. Taste frequently.&quot; The receipt did not specify the number of eggs to use, however modern chefs estimate approximately one dozen.

&quot;Tom and Jerry is a form of hot eggnog [cocktail] that was once popular.&quot; The Tom and Jerry was invented by British journalist Pierce Egan in the 1820s, using brandy and rum added to eggnog and served hot, usually in a mug or a bowl. It is a traditional Christmastime cocktail in the United States.

Isaac Weld, Junior, in his book &quot;Travels Through the States of North America and the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, during the years 1795, 1796, and 1797&quot; (published in 1800) wrote: &quot;The American travelers, before they pursued their journey, took a hearty draught each, according to custom, of egg-nog, a mixture composed of new milk, eggs, rum, and sugar, beat up together&quot;. In a similar way to how posset was drunk as a cold remedy in the Medieval era, there is evidence that eggnog was also used as a medical treatment. An 1892 scientific journal article proposes the use of eggnog to treat &quot;grippe&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;flu&quot;, along with ammonium chloride to treat the cough and quinine to cure the illness.

In the American South, eggnog is made with bourbon. Eggnog is called &quot;coquito&quot; in Puerto Rico, where rum and fresh coconut juice or coconut milk are used in its preparation. Mexican eggnog, also known as &quot;rompope&quot;, was developed in Santa Clara. It differs from regular eggnog in its use of Mexican cinnamon and rum or grain alcohol. In Peru, eggnog is called &quot;biblia con pisco&quot;, and it is made with a Peruvian pomace brandy called pisco. German eggnog, called &quot;biersuppe&quot;, is made with beer. &quot;Eierpunsch&quot; is a German version of eggnog made with white wine, eggs, sugar, cloves, tea, lemon or lime juice and cinnamon. Another recipe dating from 1904 calls for eggs, lemon juice, sugar, white wine, water and rum. In Iceland, eggnog &quot;is served hot as a dessert.&quot;

==Ingredients and serving style==
===Homemade===
Traditional homemade eggnog is made of milk or cream, sugar, raw eggs, one or more alcoholic spirits, and spices, often vanilla or nutmeg and in some recipes, cloves. Some recipes call for the eggs to be separated so that the egg whites can be whipped until they are thick; this gives the drink a frothy texture. American food show presenter Alton Brown points out that based on its ingredients, eggnog is &quot;almost identical to ice cream. It is technically just a stirred custard made of milk and egg&quot;. Homemade recipes may use vanilla ice cream blended into the beverage, particularly when the goal is to create a chilled drink. Some recipes call for condensed milk or evaporated milk in addition to milk and cream. Acidophilus milk, a fermented milk product, has been used to make eggnog. While some recipes call for unwhipped heavy cream, in some recipes, whipped cream is added to the mixture, which gives it a frothier texture. Various sweeteners are used, such as white sugar, brown sugar and maple syrup.

There are variations in ingredients in different recipes. Traditional eggnog has a significant fat content, due to the use of cream, and a high sugar content. Ingredients vary significantly between different recipes. Alcohol used in different national and regional versions of eggnog include brandy, cognac, bourbon, whiskey, sherry, rum and grain alcohol. Canadian chef Heidi Fink states that one of the reasons people are making less homemade eggnog is that the beverage is expensive to make, due to its use of substantial quantities of cream, eggs, and spirits. Concerns about the safety of raw eggs may be another reason for the decline in homemade eggnog making.

===Commercially prepared===
Modern commercial eggnog manufacturers add gelatin and other thickeners, a cost-savings measure that enables manufacturers to produce a thick beverage while using less egg and cream. &quot;Commercial eggnog tends to contain less eggs than homemade nog&quot;. In the US, FDA regulations only require that 1.0 percent of a product&#x27;s final weight be made up of egg yolk solids for it to bear the eggnog name. Under current U.S. law, commercial products sold as eggnog are permitted to contain milk, sugar, modified milk ingredients, glucose-fructose, water, carrageenan, guar gum, natural and artificial flavorings, spices, monoglycerides, and colorings. In Canada, the National Dairy Code defines eggnog as: &quot;food made from milk and cream containing milk and cream which has been flavored and sweetened. The food shall contain not less than 3.25 per cent milk fat and not less than 23 per cent total solids.&quot; In Canada, if a commercial product does not contain eggs, it cannot be called &quot;eggnog&quot;.

Ready-made eggnog versions are seasonally available with different spirits, or without alcohol, to be drunk as bought or used as &quot;mixes&quot; with all the ingredients except the liquor, to be added as desired. While eggnog is mostly available from American Thanksgiving through to Christmas, in some regions a marshmallow-flavoured version is sold at Easter. In the 2000s, low-fat and sugar-free commercial versions are available using sugar substitutes and skimmed or low fat milk.

The Dutch liqueur advocaat, with around 20% alcohol, and German Eierlikör, are essentially an eggnog, although the former only tends to have a similar consistency to eggnog in export markets, where it is sometimes used to make the snowball cocktail. In the Netherlands, advocaat is normally available as a thick and creamy confection which is either consumed as is or used as a topping for various desserts.

====Non-dairy and vegan versions====

Some North American manufacturers offer soy-, almond-, oat-, rice- or coconut milk-based alternatives for vegans and those with dairy allergies, lactose intolerance or other dietary restrictions. The history of non-dairy eggnogs goes back to 1899 when Almeda Lambert, in her &quot;Guide for Nut Cookery&quot;, gave a recipe for &quot;Eggnog&quot; made using coconut cream, eggs, and sugar. In 1973, Eunice Farmilant, in &quot;The Natural Foods Sweet-Tooth Cookbook&quot;, gave a more modern non-dairy eggnog recipe.

In 1981, Grain Country of Los Angeles, California, introduced Grain Nog, the earliest non-dairy and vegan eggnog. Vegan means that a food contains no animal products, including milk or eggs. Based on amazake (a traditional Japanese fermented rice beverage) and containing no eggs, Grain Nog was available in plain, strawberry, and carob flavors. Also in 1981, Redwood Valley Soyfoods Unlimited (California) introduced &quot;Soynog&quot;, the earliest soy-based non-dairy and vegan eggnog based on soy milk and tofu (added for thickness). It was renamed Lite Nog in 1982 and Tofu Nog in 1985.

===Serving and presentation===
Whether homemade or commercial eggnog is being served, toppings may be added, such as grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon, whipped cream, a cinnamon stick, chocolate shavings or a vanilla pod. Eggnog can be served in glasses, mugs or stemmed brandy snifters. Eggnog may be served to guests already poured into a glass or other container, or it may be served in a punch bowl, so that guests can serve themselves. Both homemade and commercial eggnogs are made in alcohol-free versions and recipes in which alcoholic beverages, generally brown, aged spirits such as bourbon, brandy or rum are added during preparation or directly to the cup after the nog is poured. For example, for rum, some recipes specify dark rum or spiced rum, for extra flavor. A few recipes suggest Baileys Irish Cream liqueur, apple brandy or even Guinness stout as the alcohol.

==Use as flavoring==
The distinctive spices that give eggnog its characteristic taste, including cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla, are used to create eggnog-flavored foods and beverages. Eggnog-flavored foods include eggnog ice cream, pie, cupcakes, rum cake, cookies, biscotti, pancake syrup, bread pudding, French toast and waffles. Eggnog-flavored beverages include eggnog lattes (developed by Starbucks in the mid-1980s), eggnog-flavored coffee and tea, some craft beers (e.g., eggnog stout) and eggnog milkshakes.

==Health and safety==
===Raw eggs===
Most homemade eggnog recipes have historically included raw eggs. While the alcohol added to many homemade eggnogs is a bactericide, eggnog freshly made from raw eggs that are infected with salmonella and not heated can cause food poisoning. A very small percentage of raw eggs are infected with salmonella. In 1981 most of the residents and staff of a nursing home in the U.S. became ill with salmonellosis, and four died. The cause was almost certainly an eggnog made on the spur of the moment, with some cases caused in a secondary outbreak caused by food being handled later by people with contaminated hands. A later publication of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated that the alcohol in eggnog is not sufficient to sterilize contaminated eggs. Using commercial pasteurized eggs or heating the milk-egg mixture sufficiently can make the drink safe; one recipe calls for heating the mixture gently, without boiling, until it thickens enough to &quot;coat the back of a spoon.&quot;

However, aged alcoholic eggnog becomes sterilized even if made with contaminated eggs. Aging alcoholic eggnog—sometimes for as long as a year—has been said to improve its flavor significantly, and also destroys pathogens. The Rockefeller University Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology carried out an experiment in 2010 where salmonella was added to a strong eggnog which was refrigerated and stored; the beverage still had dangerous levels of salmonella a week later, but it was all gone within three weeks. A concentration of at least 20% of alcohol (about the same amounts of alcoholic spirits and milk or cream), and refrigeration are recommended for safety.

For concerns about the safety of selling products made from raw eggs and milk, the U.S. FDA has changed or altered the definition of eggnog a number of times towards artificial replacements for the large number of eggs traditionally used. FDA regulations () require eggnog to contain at least 1% egg yolk solids and at least 8.25% milk solids. Some recipes for homemade eggnog call for egg yolks to be cooked with milk into a custard to avoid potential hazards from raw eggs.

===Alcohol content===

When people make homemade alcoholic eggnog, or when they add spirits to commercially-prepared eggnog, the drink can have a very high alcohol content. One columnist states that in his family Christmas tradition, &quot;it&#x27;s not eggnog unless you can set fire to it&quot;, due to high alcohol percentage. Jazz composer Charles Mingus had an eggnog recipe that contained enough alcohol, including 151 proof rum, to &quot;put down an elephant&quot;.

There is a long history of heavily alcohol-spiked eggnog. An 1894 book by a North Carolina traveler describes using &quot;half gallon of brandy for an eggnog&quot;. CNN states that some 19th century American eggnog recipes called for significant amounts of alcohol; one recipe &quot;calls for three dozen eggs, half a gallon of domestic brandy, and another half-pint of French brandy.&quot; The high alcohol content of traditional eggnog inevitably led to problems. In 19th-century Baltimore, it was a custom for young men of the town to go from house to house on New Year’s Day, toasting their hosts in eggnog along the way. The challenge: to finish one’s rounds still standing.&quot;

In 2015, controversy arose over a Bloomingdale&#x27;s advertisement which referred to adding alcohol to eggnog. The ad depicted a man and a woman, with the woman looking away from the man, and it was captioned &quot;Spike your best friend’s eggnog when they’re not looking&quot;. After being widely criticized on social media websites such as Twitter as seemingly endorsing date rape and alcohol-facilitated sexual assault, Bloomingdales responded with an apology: &quot;In reflection of recent feedback, the copy we used in our recent catalog was inappropriate and in poor taste. Bloomingdale’s sincerely apologizes for this error in judgment.&quot;

The most notable case of alcohol problems associated with the drink was the Eggnog Riot at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, on 23–25 December 1826. Alcohol possession at the academy was prohibited, along with drunkenness and intoxication, both of which could lead to expulsion. By 1826, concern had been raised that drinking was starting to get out of hand among the 260 cadets at the academy. The cadets were informed that, due to the alcohol prohibition on the site, their Christmas eggnog would be alcohol-free, prompting the decision by cadets to smuggle liquor into the academy. Gallons of whiskey were smuggled into the barracks to make eggnog for a Christmas Day party. This led to &quot;a drunken free-for-all. Windows, furniture, and crockery were smashed; banisters were torn from walls, fights broke out. One eggnog-addled cadet tried, but failed, to shoot his commanding officer.&quot; The incident resulted in the court-martialing of twenty cadets and one enlisted soldier. Future Confederate States President Jefferson Davis, was found not guilty of any offence and was not expelled.

===Nutritional aspects===
According to the USDA, a one cup (250 ml) serving of eggnog contains (17% of a typical person&#x27;s daily value of food energy); 34.4 grams of carbohydrates (11% of DV), including 21.4 grams of sugar; 19 grams of fat (29% of DV); and 9.7 grams of protein (19% of DV). TIME magazine&#x27;s Tristan Stephenson states that eggnog&#x27;s &quot;alcohol and sugar provide energy, eggs supply protein, and the fat from the milk or cream gives the [wintertime] drinker the necessary &quot;layers&quot; to deal with the frost.&quot; &quot;TIME&quot; magazine also states that with its cream, eggs and sugar ingredients, &quot;eggnog can pack in upwards of 400 [kilocalories; 1700 kJ] per cup.&quot; CNN states that a &quot;...relatively small four-ounce [120 mL] cup of store-bought eggnog boasts a whopping (half of them from fat), nearly 10 grams of fat, and over 70 mg of cholesterol...[, which is] around a quarter of your recommended daily intake of cholesterol.&quot; &quot;National Geographic&quot; writer Rebecca Rupp states that with eggnog&#x27;s saturated fat, cholesterol, liquor and high calorie count, &quot;...[t]here&#x27;s no way this stuff is good for us.&quot; &quot;Esquire&quot; states that &quot;[e]ggnog is irredeemable from a nutritional standpoint. Period. The pre-packaged stuff is mostly made from high-fructose corn syrup, dairy fat, and a bunch of unlovable additives&quot; and it recommends a &quot;two-drink maximum&quot; for health reasons.

==Reception and consumption==

Eggnog has a polarized reception from food critics, chefs and consumers; &quot;Esquire&quot; states that &quot;there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a middle ground on eggnog. You either love it or hate it&quot;. While some are enthusiastic advocates of the beverage, others are critical of its taste or consistency. The CBC stated that the &quot;ancient drink can be quite divisive.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Andrew Shanahan described eggnog in a critical manner in 2006: &quot;People rarely get it right, but even if you do it still tastes horrible. The smell is like an omelet and the consistency defies belief. It lurches around the glass like partially-sentient sludge.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Tristan Stephenson states that eggnog is popular because it &quot;[t]ick[s] every single one of the guilt/pleasure boxes, on account of being little more than fat, sugar, and alcohol&quot;, which makes it &quot;so ludicrously delicious&quot;, a sort of &quot;alcoholic custard&quot;. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; writer Carmen Maria Machado described an anti-eggnog article in the &quot;Times&quot; as a &quot;buzzkill&quot; for providing the drink&#x27;s calorie count; Machado argues that &quot;[e]ggnog’s decadence should not be considered sinful; indeed, it is one of those foods whose low-fat variations I believe to be a kind of crime.&quot;

Canadian chef Heidi Fink, from Victoria, praises homemade nog but criticizes the &quot;slimy&quot; &quot;glop you can buy in supermarkets&quot;. Chowhound criticized Trader Joe&#x27;s chocolate-flavored eggnog, calling it &quot;ghastly&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; argued against the use of eggnog flavoring (and other flavors, like blueberry) in coffee, calling the results &quot;Franken-coffee&quot;.

Consumption in the United States in 2019 was 53.5 million bottles purchased and Americans spent $185 million on eggnog. The consumption of egg nog was down 42 percent since 1969.

The drink is more popular in the United States in the 2000s than the United Kingdom, despite the fact that it was developed in Britain and then transplanted to the American colonies in the 1700s. As of 2014, Canadians are drinking less store-bought eggnog. They drank 5.3 million liters of commercial eggnog in 2014&#x27;s Christmas period; this is less than in 1994, when they drank eight million liters. Some of the possible reasons for the decline in Canadian eggnog consumption could be concerns about raw eggs (for homemade eggnog) and health concerns, regarding the fat and sugar content of the drink.
