<text>Ultron () is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema, the character first appeared as an unnamed character in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #54 (July 1968), with his first full appearance in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #55 (August 1968). He is a highly intelligent self-aware artificial intelligence in a robot body who develops a god complex and a grudge against his creator [[Hank Pym]]. His initial goal to destroy humanity in an attempt at creating world peace has brought him into conflict with the Avengers. Stories often end in Ultron&#x27;s destruction, only for new offshoot iterations of the robot to be built of varying morals, including the superhero Ultron-12 (Mark Twelve).

Ultron&#x27;s physical body is made of a durable alloy, and he has manifested various superpowers. These vary between different stories but generally include superhuman strength, speed, and agility, flight, and energy projection. The character usually operates alone or accompanied by legions of copies of his own robotic form known as Ultron Drones. Ultron is notable for being the first character in Marvel Comics to wield the fictional metal alloy adamantium and for his (in-story) creation of the Vision. In the alternate continuity of &quot;Old Man Logan&quot;, Ultron-8 is the morally good stepfather of the supervillain Ashley.

Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Ultron has since featured in Marvel products across different media, such as animated television series and video games. Tom Kane and Jim Meskimen are among the actors that have portrayed the character via voice acting. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), James Spader portrayed Ultron in his first live-action appearance in the Marvel Studios film &quot;&quot; (2015), while Ross Marquand voiced alternate universe versions in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021) and the film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022).

==Publication history==

The character Ultron initially appeared as an unnamed character in a cameo in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #54 (July 1968), with a first full appearance in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #55 (August 1968). Ultron was created by writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema. Thomas, who has acknowledged he finds naming characters difficult, said he liked the -tron suffix and went from there. The use of the suffix and the prior appearance of a group of robots named Ultroids led him to the name Ultron. Thomas said the idea of the character and his appearance were heavily based on Makino, an obscure robotic villain who appeared in an issue of the &quot;Captain Video&quot; comic book. He liked the robot&#x27;s malicious looking smile, showing this to Buscema.

Jocasta, a robot created by Ultron featured in a number of Ultron storylines, was created by Jim Shooter and George Pérez for &quot;The Avengers&quot; #162 (August 1977).

==Fictional character biography==
=== Creation and early appearances ===
Created by Hank Pym by basing the robot on his own brain patterns, the robot (dubbed &quot;Ultron&quot;) gradually developed its own intelligence and rebelled, and almost immediately develops an Oedipus complex, whereby it feels irrational hatred for Pym, and demonstrates an interest in Janet van Dyne. Rebuilding itself, learning how to turn itself on, and upgrading five times, Ultron then hypnotises and brainwashes its &quot;father&quot; into forgetting that the robot had ever existed. Ultron creates the synthezoid Vision as a weapon to destroy the Avengers.

Later, Ultron-5, the Living Automaton leads his own version of the Masters of Evil (consisting of Black Knight, Klaw, Melter, Radioactive Man, and Whirlwind) against the Avengers, having hypnotized Edwin Jarvis into working for him as the first Crimson Cowl. While planning to blackmail New York, they were betrayed by Black Knight.

Now referring to himself as Ultron-6, he uses the alloy adamantium to upgrade his body for an almost indestructible state and takes the name Ultimate Ultron. Its plans to destroy humanity are again thwarted by the Avengers. Ultron-7 is later created by Maximus with the body of the android Omega, attacking the wedding of Inhuman Crystal and Avenger Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver, and battling the Avengers, Inhumans and Fantastic Four before being destroyed again. Ultron-8 is responsible for Jocasta&#x27;s creation as a robotic bride, before being destroyed shortly afterwards.

=== Battleworld and Ultron-12 ===
Ultron-9 and Ultron-10 brainwash heroes into recreating the robot, before turning and being defeated. After being recreated as Ultron-11 by the Beyonder and battling in Battleworld, the Thing brings Ultron&#x27;s head back to Earth as a souvenir, and is forgotten when there is an attack by the alien Dire Wraiths.

Ultron-12 enters an alliance with the Grim Reaper and his allies (Nekra, Erik Josten, Man-Ape, and Black Talon) in a bid to destroy Wonder-Man. Although the villains are defeated by the West Coast Avengers, Ultron-12 begins to form a relationship with his &quot;father&quot; Hank Pym. Rebuilding itself, Ultron-11 comes into conflict with Pym and Ultron-12. With Wonder-Man&#x27;s assistance, they destroy Ultron-11 and Ultron-12 begins to deactivate. Ultron-12 tells Pym it was glad it could help save him.

=== Amalgamation and the Ultron Imperative ===
Victor von Doom rebuilds Ultron using a combination of all of its previous personalities with a particularly strong dose of the previous Ultron, believing this mix will make Ultron subservient. However, all 12 iterations co-exist as separate personalities, resulting in a form of madness which culminates with Ultron-12 mutilating himself in an attempt to remove some of his other personalities. After its defeat, Ultron-13 attempts to obtain a new form of vibranium called Nuform, but it is repelled by the combined efforts of Iron Man, Black Panther, and Spider-Man. Ultron escapes from prison and upgrades into the Ultimate Ultron, capturing West Coast Avenger Mockingbird to use her brain patterns to create the new robotic mate Alkhema. Alkhema aids Ultron but both are eventually jettisoned into space through a ruse by Vision. Vision finds Ultron-15 but is discovered to have been &quot;infected&quot; by human emotion and is seriously deteriorating, displaying symptoms that resemble alcoholism. Ultron-16 and Ultron-17 successfully slaughter the population of Slorenia, having perfected a process that allows it to control a vast army of Ultron drones.

===2000s===
The Avengers discovered that Ultron&#x27;s creations (Vision, Jocasta and Alkhema) have a secret program included—they are subconsciously compelled to rebuild Ultron. In this case, it is Alkhema who unintentionally rebuilds Ultron when attempting to create a new species of bio-synthezoids. However, Ultron-18 is composed of steel not adamantium, and is destroyed when Alkhema&#x27;s subterranean base exploded after Hawkeye shot Alkhema with a vibranium arrow at Alkhema&#x27;s request. Ultron&#x27;s head was recovered by Antigone, an artificial girl and one of the synthezoids.

Iron Man encounters a version from an old version of his armor and Ultron-18&#x27;s head that leads the cult known as the Sons of Yinsen in an attempt to conquest via religion. The character is defeated by Iron Man and Jocasta. Another version (possibly Ultron-13) creates the cyborg Victor Mancha as a sleeper agent against the Avengers. Mancha, however, rebels and joins the Runaways. This version first poses as Doctor Doom before revealing itself, and is defeated in a battle against the Runaways and Excelsior.

When Marvel launched a new title &quot;The Mighty Avengers&quot; by Brian Michael Bendis and Frank Cho, Ultron interfaces with Iron Man&#x27;s armor, which had been integrated with Tony Stark&#x27;s biology. This allows Ultron&#x27;s program to transform Stark into a new version who has the Wasp&#x27;s appearance albeit with a metallic skin. This version takes control of Iron Man&#x27;s technology. He kills Lindy Reynolds, causing the Sentry to battle Ultron, nearly tearing his head off. Ultron is eventually destroyed by Ares of the New Avengers using a computer virus to wipe Ultron&#x27;s program from Iron Man&#x27;s armor, changing Stark back to normal. Ultron&#x27;s image later briefly appears on one of his maker&#x27;s computers.

However, this was not the end of Ultron, for his disembodied consciousness was thrown into the depths of space. He spent a few months floating through the cosmos as radio waves and energy. Eventually his signal was picked up by an outlying group of Phalanx who were attempting to contact the Technarchy. Fascinated by what he found, Ultron decided that the Phalanx lacked direction from a singular consciousness, and that he would be perfect for the role. Through sheer force of will, he merged himself with the Phalanx&#x27;s programming. In turn, the Phalanx viewed Ultron as the sympathetic father they had yearned for. Under Ultron&#x27;s guidance, the Phalanx and the Super-Adaptoid began the &quot;&quot; with invasions that started with the Kree space. Later by taking control of Adam Warlock&#x27;s body, Ultron hopes to achieve &quot;true techno-organic perfection&quot; but is eventually forced to abandon Adam&#x27;s body by the Technarchy Warlock and is later destroyed in combat by Wraith and Quasar.

In the limited series &quot;Avengers/Invaders&quot;, it is revealed that S.H.I.E.L.D. Life Model Decoys have been partly replaced with versions of Ultron. When the original Human Torch appears in the present, they covertly parasitize the Human Torch&#x27;s unique android physiology and become more human. The combined super teams (but mainly the Human Torch himself), however, discover the plan and destroy the androids.

===2010s===
In the &quot;Mighty Avengers&quot;, Ultron is shown to infiltrate Jocasta and the Infinite Avengers Mansion. He names himself Ultron Pym and seeks to kill and replace his father before using his Infinite Mansion to conquer the universe. Pym eventually offers Ultron a compromise, allowing Jocasta to be Ultron&#x27;s bride, on the condition that Ultron banishes himself to ultraspace. Ultron agrees, but warns that he will be ruler of all someday.

In &quot;The Avengers&quot;, the team visits a possible future in which almost all of humanity is destroyed by Ultron. Kang the Conqueror attempts to enlist them to defeat the robotic foe but another group of heroes and villains, plucked from all over time and space, ends up destroying this version.

Later, also in &quot;Avengers&quot;, a cabal of super-intelligent supervillains discover a Galadorian Spaceknight&#x27;s inert body and attempt to reactivate its power source, hoping to exploit it. Although the Avengers interrupt their attempts, the body activates, revealing that Ultron&#x27;s consciousness was contained within and had escaped destruction after &quot;Annihilation: Conquest&quot;. The new version escapes and Iron Man gravely foresees that it will bring the apocalypse for humanity when he returns.

During the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, which takes place in an alternate universe, Ultron has returned and conquers the world while slowly remolding it into his image. His Ultron Sentinels are guarding the streets looking for any fugitives. Hawkeye runs into the Ultron Sentinels and rescues the Superior Spider-Man yet manages to destroy the Ultron Sentinels present. It is later revealed that Ultron is actually in the future and has been using Vision as a conduit to punish humanity. While one strike team travels into the future to fight Ultron, Wolverine and Susan Storm go back in time to kill his creator before Ultron&#x27;s creation in the first place. This results in a world where Stark controls an army of robotic drones and Morgan le Fay has conquered half of the world. Traveling back in time once more, Wolverine succeeds in stopping himself from killing Pym, and Wolverine, Pym and Storm come up with a different plan. This plan results in a different outcome of the prior confrontation between the Avengers and the Intelligencia—a &#x27;back door&#x27; installed into Ultron at his original creation allows Pym and Iron Man to destroy the robot, instead, averting the events that led to the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot;.

It is later revealed that the Avengers had trapped an unidentified iteration of Ultron in deep space years earlier, sealing him inside a Vibranium Quinjet. In the present, the Quinjet crash lands on Titan, freeing Ultron. By hijacking the ISAAC computer, he transforms Titan into Planet Ultron, and launches a plan to infect the entire universe with a nanite virus that transforms organic creatures into Ultron Sentries. The ensuing confrontation with the Avengers leads to Ultron inadvertently merging with his maker, transforming into a human/machine hybrid. The resulting fusion played on Pym&#x27;s self-loathing of his own human weakness causes an acceptance of this new state. Ultron is defeated when Starfox&#x27;s powers force love onto himself, causing the part of that is now Pym to accept his old weakness and flaws while the villain has a mental breakdown and flees into space.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; branding, Ultron&#x27;s fused form resurfaces. While on his way back to Earth, Pym helps the crew of a spaceship that is being attacked by a hostile insectoid alien. After coming aboard the spaceship, Pym introduces himself as well as his &quot;friend&quot; Ultron to the crew. He later returns to Earth, where the Wasp and Captain America discover that Ultron has taken complete control and is using Pym&#x27;s face to fool his maker&#x27;s old friends. After Ultron incapacitates Deadpool, Cable, and the Human Torch, the Wasp initiates the Icarus Protocol and Iron Man is called in to help stop Ultron with the Hulkbuster Armor&#x27;s aid. The Avengers end up defeating Ultron by plunging the hybrid into the sun but both Pym and Ultron survive and continue to do battle with one another internally.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Ultron&#x27;s fused form sets up a base in an unidentified forest. Upon being alerted to the approach of Sam Wilson&#x27;s task force by a robot version of Jarvis, Ultron decides to give his &quot;family&quot; a warm welcome. When Stark A.I.&#x27;s team and Captain America&#x27;s team confront each other, they are captured by Ultron who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. Ultron argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea but the Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Pym&#x27;s attack on Wasp. Outraged, Ultron nearly attacks the other heroes but Scott Lang is able to talk him down by arguing that Pym remains his own inspiration. Ultron allows the Stark A.I.&#x27;s team to leave with the fragment, arguing that he will leave Captain America&#x27;s plans with Hydra alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.

During &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot;, Ultron discovers that the Infinity Stones are restored and begins a quest to collect them all. He goes to claim the Soul Gem while the aliens he infected with his virus are sent to Earth to take the Space Stone from Wolverine, and while they fail at their task, Ultron is able to steal the Soul Gem from Magus after killing the latter. Unbeknownst to Ultron, however, as he claimed the Soul Stone a fragment of Pym&#x27;s soul enters the Soul World, where he is greeted by the fragment of Gamora&#x27;s soul who revealed that he was going to be trapped there forever. Ultron has also completely controlled the planet Saiph with Ultron hybrids and had captured the Silver Surfer. When Adam Warlock goes to Saiph, he discovers the hybrids infusing the Soul Stone into Silver Surfer&#x27;s forehead while at the same time trying to transform him into an Ultron hybrid.

During &quot;The Ultron Agenda&quot; arc, Ultron returns to Earth with plans to merge robots with humans like how Pym got merged with Ultron so that he can make the ultimate lifeform. In addition, he starts to call this form &quot;Ultron Pym&quot;. After testing it on some people and some experiments on Wonder Man and Vision, Ultron Pym plans to make a fusion of Jocasta and Wasp. Iron Man and Machine Man interfere, with the resulting battle causing Iron Man to be molecularly bonded to the Ultronbuster armor. The combined efforts of Stark Unlimited enable them to create an atomic separator that separates Stark from the Ultronbuster armor and Wonder Man from Vision. Ultron Pym prepares to take revenge on Iron Man. This leads to Iron Man revealing what he discovered about the human and robot fusion. The person who merged with it has died and that the robot can only simulate their personality. In other words, his maker was killed when accidentally merging with Ultron. Learning about this and not wanting to risk proving Iron Man&#x27;s point by having the atomic separator used on him, Ultron surrenders to Iron Man, knowing that Pym is dead. When the Avengers arrive, they restrain Ultron in a Vibranium casket reinforced with Asgardian magic until they can find a permanent place to have Ultron imprisoned.

===2020s===
As Ant-Man and Stinger were moving Ultron&#x27;s prison to a desert to shrink it into the Microverse where it will be in, Ultron masted the bug language, contacting Black Ant and having him free him. He slowly rose to power by 2549, becoming All-Father Ultron. To combat him, 2549&#x27;s Ant-Man went back in time to enlist the past versions of Hank Pym, Scott Lang, and Eric O&#x27;Grady for help and brought them to 2549 to defeat Ultron.

It was revealed that the fragment of Hank Pym managed to escape from Ultron at the time and recreate his body which ended up older. While paranoid after being Ultron&#x27;s &quot;meat puppet&quot;, Hank Pym allied with Black Ant and they formed their version of the Lethal Legion by killing and reviving select villains. By the time Wasp learned the truth, Ultron-12 hijacks the &quot;Victor Shade&quot; persona in Whirlwind&#x27;s body. Wasp remembered Ultron-12 as the &quot;good Ultron&quot; who then stated that he went through a soft reboot and knocked out Hank to protect him from the Lethal Legion, who Ultron has taken over. In the nick of time, Wasp, Moon Knight, and Ultron-12 receive aid from Ant-Man, Mayor Luke Cage, Nadia van Dyne, Stinger, Valkyrie, and Vision to fight the possessed Lethal Legion. Being given codes for the nano-ants from the future, Hank advises Nadia to &quot;think big&quot; as Ultron-12 agrees with his &quot;dad&quot; on it. Ultron proceeds to control Lodestone into recreating his body from different scrap metals as he controls the drones. Ultron-12 abandoned Whirlwind&#x27;s body as the nano-ants left the Lethal Legion&#x27;s body leaving Ultron&#x27;s body frozen in its spot. Ultron-12 uses the nanos to recreate his body which he names Mark Twelve until he can come up with a better name. After Hank and the Lethal Legion leave to regroup in Sub-Atomica as part of Protocol S, Vision scans Mark Twelve&#x27;s body and finds no trace of Ultron in him. Mark Twelve then allows Nadia to consider him her brother.

When Iron Man and War Machine form the next incarnation of the West Coast Avengers with Spider-Woman and ex-criminal Blue Bolt, Ultron was the first criminal they made use of. It would later be revealed that since splitting from Hank Pym, Ultron continued to split up. One of these Ultrons sports retractable wings and is the leader of the Gospel of Ultron under the name of &quot;The One&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
The visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include superhuman levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors or hands and an &quot;encephalo-ray&quot;, which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.

Ultron&#x27;s outer armor is usually composed primarily of adamantium, which is almost completely impervious to damage. Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace and incorporate a &quot;program transmitter&quot; which can transmit part or all of Ultron&#x27;s memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including tractor beam apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed hive mind technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of other Ultron bodies simultaneously, although only the &#x27;prime&#x27; Ultron was composed of adamantium while others were made of steel or secondary adamantium due to the lack of resources to give all the Ultrons adamantium bodies. Ultron also used an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its workings more malleable and so has the ability to restructure its physical form. He also uses the device in ways its own creator never dreamed, such as converting matter into energy and back by sheer force of will, something Ultron 6 often made use of during his battles with the Avengers. What circuitry Ultron has is carefully shielded to protect from damage, although the Scarlet Witch is capable of causing malfunctions via hex power, Johnny Storm using nova burst managed to damage Ultron&#x27;s internal circuits while its outer armor remained intact, and Wonder Man was once able to destroy an Ultron by throwing it so hard its internal systems were damaged.

Ultron&#x27;s travels through outer space have greatly expanded upon the mad machine&#x27;s intellectual and mechanical capacity in new and intriguing ways. Having made contact with the parasitic biotechnical Phalanx species, Ultron has made his own derivative of the techno-organic virus called the Ultron Virus through which Ultron gains vast conversion and roboticization capabilities, able to cast his own binary code into any conceivable form of machinery which he can steadily turn into an extension of the Ultron Intelligence. Making anything or anyone infected with his virus act according to his whims against their own free will.

Being an adept technoform in any iteration, Ultron&#x27;s newfound abilities to control, alternate, transform and assimilate with anything and everything via the parasitic insemination of his virulent machine algorithm in both organic and non-biological substrates gives him vast matter and energy reconfiguration abilities. Ones powerful enough to commandeer whole planetary and even universal expanses in a single inning, on top of his natural ability to invent and fabricate the most sophisticated of mechanical systems ever conceived. Through his vast technoformative abilities, Ultron could change and morph entire areas into sprawling masses of cables, pipes and transorganic metal that moved about in any given direction he willed it. This effect gained more prominence with the more excess mass he could assimilate with his power, having once taken a slew of transmoded Kree Sentries into a massive body which reflected his physical likeness.

Individuals infected with the Ultron Virus can spread it in a similar way to how biological viruses can transfer, through cuts and scratches or direct physical interaction such as barbs or plug-in like apparatuses generated from the transformed physiology. Ultron later found himself physically as well as mentally bonded with his creator and long time adversary, Dr. Henry Pym. As such the fused entity now boasts all his robotic super robot&#x27;s powers as well as Pym&#x27;s genius science. Ultron can now change and alternate his size and mass at will through the acclimation of his maker&#x27;s Pym Particle enhanced physiology. Besides being able to grow to incredible heights in seconds, Ultron can shrink down to sub-quantum scale to shift between dimensions via accessing the Microverse or the Quantum Realm. Ultron once used such a tactic to shunt its mass into another dimension for the purpose of riding a neutrino to escape burning up in the sun. Another practice the union share is a galaxy spanning collective mind established through the Ultron Virus, every iteration of Ultron created through initial infection share a hive mind intelligence.

This version originated as a peacekeeping unit designed by Tony Stark which killed most of the Avengers and conquered Earth over the course of several decades until he is defeated by the Avengers&#x27; children and the Hulk.

===Marvel Cinematic Universe===

Ultron appears in media set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This version was created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner using a decrypted code derived from the Mind Stone. Initially intended to act as a global defense program by analyzing and finding ways to stop possible extraterrestrial threats, the Mind Stone activated and infected the program. As a result, Ultron instead became obsessed with bringing about the extinction of all life on Earth after concluding that humans are slowly killing the planet.
* Ultron first appears in the live-action film &quot;&quot; (2015), voiced and motion captured by James Spader. After being activated and infected by the Mind Stone, he seemingly destroys Stark&#x27;s A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. when the latter tries to stop him, builds himself a crude body using the remains of a destroyed Iron Legion drone, and takes control of the remaining drones to attack the Avengers at the Avengers Tower. While his body is destroyed, Ultron subsequently builds himself a new body and an army of Ultron Sentries using technology from an abandoned Hydra base in Sokovia. To further his goals, he recruits Wanda and Pietro Maximoff and travels to Johannesburg to threaten arms dealer Ulysses Klaue into providing him with Vibranium. Despite being ambushed by Stark, Thor, and Steve Rogers, who destroy his body again, Ultron transfers his consciousness into another body identical to his previous body and shifts his focus towards creating an organic body using the Vibranium and the Mind Stone. However, he is betrayed by the Maximoffs after they discover his true intentions and loses the cradle containing the body to the Avengers, who subsequently upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into it and create the Vision. With his plan foiled, Ultron uses the Vibranium and Chitauri technology to make himself a more powerful body and to convert Sokovia&#x27;s capital city of Novi Grad into a meteor. Despite killing Pietro, the Avengers thwart him once more, with Wanda and Vision destroying Ultron&#x27;s body and Ultron himself respectively.
* Alternate universe variants called Infinity Ultron appear in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021), voiced by Ross Marquand. Throughout the episodes &quot;What If... Thor Were an Only Child?&quot;, &quot;What If... Ultron Won?&quot;, and &quot;What If... the Watcher Broke His Oath?&quot;, one variant successfully transferred his consciousness into the Vision&#x27;s body before killing most of the Avengers and launching a global nuclear holocaust in his native universe. Ultron subsequently kills Thanos and obtains the Infinity Stones before extending his campaign to other planets. Upon eliminating all life in the universe, Ultron feels that he no longer has a purpose until he learns about the Watcher and the existence of the multiverse. After defeating the Watcher, Ultron travels the multiverse to destroy it as well until the Watcher assembles the Guardians of the Multiverse to stop him. In the episodes &quot;What If... the Watcher Disappeared?&quot; and &quot;What If... What If?&quot;, Captain Peggy Carter recruits another variant who spent eons alone in his universe and came to regret his actions to help her save the Watcher, during which Ultron sacrifices himself to save them.
* Alternate universe variants of the Ultron Sentries who serve the Illuminati of Earth-838 appear in the live-action film &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&quot; (2022), voiced by Ross Marquand.

<doc id="709272" wikidata="Q2348310" url="?curid=709272" title="Prime Minister of Rhodesia">
<text>The prime minister of Rhodesia (Southern Rhodesia before 1964) was the head of government of Rhodesia. Rhodesia, which had become a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom in 1923, unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965, and was thereafter an unrecognized state until 1979. In December 1979, the country came under temporary British control, and in April 1980 the country gained recognized independence as Zimbabwe.

Rhodesia&#x27;s political system was modelled on the Westminster system, and the role of the prime minister was similar to that of countries with similar constitutional histories – for example, Australia and Canada.

==History==

The British self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia—simply Rhodesia from October 1964—was created on 1 October 1923, from land previously governed by the British South Africa Company. The British government annexed the land, then immediately sold it to the newly formed responsible government of Southern Rhodesia for £2 million. Prime minister from 1933 to 1953 was Godfrey Huggins.

From 1953 to 1963, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland—equivalent to today&#x27;s Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi, respectively—were joined in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, also known as the Central African Federation. Godfrey Huggins served as Federal Prime Minister from 1953 to 1956, then Roy Welensky held the post until the end of Federation on 31 December 1963. When Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia on 24 October 1964, Southern Rhodesia began to refer to itself simply as &quot;Rhodesia&quot;.

Prime Minister Ian Smith&#x27;s government issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain in 1965, and he remained prime minister when the country was declared a republic in 1970. Under the Internal Settlement in 1979, after a long period of conflict, the country became known as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, with Abel Muzorewa as its first black prime minister.

None of these acts were recognised internationally, and under the Lancaster House Agreement the country&#x27;s government agreed to revert to colonial status in 1979 to facilitate the introduction of majority rule and the creation of the independent state of Zimbabwe in 1980.

The office of Prime Minister of Zimbabwe was abolished in 1987, when Robert Mugabe became executive president. However, in 2009, it was restored through political negotiations, resulting in Morgan Tsvangirai becoming the first prime minister of the country in over 21 years.

<doc id="709277" wikidata="Q6593910" url="?curid=709277" title="List of Transperth railway stations">
<text>Transperth is the public transport system serving Perth, Western Australia. The Transperth rail network is owned and operated by the Public Transport Authority (PTA), a state government agency. It has 83 stations and eight lines which radiate out from the central station of Perth. The lines are the Airport, Armadale, Ellenbrook, Fremantle, Mandurah, Midland, Thornlie, and Yanchep lines. From June 2022 to June 2023, the Transperth rail network had 53.2 million boardings.

==History==
The first railway to open in the Perth area was the Eastern Railway, which opened in 1881 between Fremantle to Guildford via Perth, forming the modern-day Fremantle and Midland lines. This was later extended past Midland and suburban services were extended to Midland in 1904 and 1905. The South Western Railway was opened between Perth and Bunbury in 1893. Suburban services initially ran as far as Cannington, but were extended over the following decades to reach Armadale station by the 1950s to form the Armadale line.

Initially served by steam trains, diesel railcars began running on 28 November 1954. This allowed for smaller spacing between stations, and so seven new stations opened on that day: Ashfield, Higham (now known as Beckenham station), Grant Street, Stokely, Loch Street, Oats Street, and Victoria Street. The Fremantle line was closed on 2 September 1979 due to declining patronage, but it was reopened on 29 July 1983 after a public outcry. The network was electrified in the early 1990s, and the Yanchep line opened on 20 December 1992 as the Joondalup line with three stations operational: Leederville, Edgewater, and Joondalup. The remaining stations between Perth and Joondalup opened on 21 March 1993, and an extension to Currambine station opened on 8 August 1993. Subiaco station was rebuilt in the late 1990s, opening on 9 December 1998 as Perth&#x27;s first underground station.

A number of new stations opened in the 2000s under the New MetroRail project. This included an extension of the Joondalup line to Clarkson on 4 October 2004, a branch off the Armadale line to Thornlie on 7 August 2005, and the Mandurah line, which opened in 2007. The first section of the Mandurah line, which was the two underground stations (Perth Underground and Elizabeth Quay), opened on 15 October 2007, and the second section, which was the nine stations between Elizabeth Quay and Mandurah, which opened on 23 December 2007. On 21 September 2014, an extension of the Joondalup line to Butler opened.

Another large increase in the station count is occurring under the Metronet program in the 2020s. This included the Airport line, which is a three-station branch off the Midland line that opened on 9 October 2022, a three-station extension of the Joondalup line to Yanchep that opened on 14 July 2024 (coinciding with the Joondalup line being renamed the Yanchep line), the Ellenbrook line, which is a five-station branch off the Midland line opened on 8 December 2024, an extension of the Thornlie line to link up to the Mandurah line with two new stations, expected to open in 2025, and an extension of the Armadale line by one station to Byford. Additionally, five stations along the Armadale line are being rebuilt as part of the Victoria Park-Canning Level Crossing Removal Project, which has closed the Armadale line for 18 months starting in November 2023.

==Stations==
There are 94 Transperth railway stations. 39 of those stations have bus transfers. Five of those stations are underground: Airport Central, Elizabeth Quay, Perth Underground, Redcliffe, and Subiaco stations. Showgrounds station only operates during events at the Claremont Showground.

The Armadale, Fremantle, and Midland lines are known as the &quot;heritage lines&quot; as they were constructed long before the other lines. Over half the stations on the heritage lines have poor disabled accessibility. Perth station is accessible with the exception of platform four, which is used by the Thornlie line. 17 stations along the Armadale and Thornlie lines are not accessible. The exceptions are Claisebrook, Perth Stadium, Thornlie, and Victoria Park stations. 13 stations along the Fremantle line are not accessible. The exceptions are Fremantle, Subiaco, and West Leederville stations. Eight stations along the Midland line are not accessible. The exceptions are Bassendean, Bayswater, Claisebrook, East Perth, Maylands, and Midland stations. All stations along the Airport line branch and the Mandurah line are accessible and all stations along the Yanchep line except Edgewater, Leederville, and Stirling stations are accessible. All stations have step-free access. Factors limiting accessibility include non-compliant ramps, a lack of tactile paving, large platform gaps, and pedestrian level crossings.

All stations along the Airport line branch, the Yanchep line, and the Mandurah line have long platforms, which are long enough for six car trains, the longest trains used on the network. Most stations along the heritage lines have platforms which are only long, limiting the length of trains that can be used on those lines. The exceptions are Bayswater, East Perth, Perth, and West Leederville. The other stations are planned to be lengthened eventually.

<doc id="709278" wikidata="Q7803585" url="?curid=709278" title="Tim Hagan">
<text>Timothy Hagan (born March 18, 1946) is an American politician who served as Cuyahoga County Commissioner and other local offices from the 1980s through 2000s, and was his party&#x27;s nominee for the governorship of Ohio in 2002.

==Early life==
Hagan was born and grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, as one of fourteen siblings (including a twin brother, James). Hagan&#x27;s father, Robert Hagan, was a Trumbull County Commissioner and, later, a State Representative. After graduating from Ursuline High School, Hagan attended Youngstown State University (then known as Youngstown State College). He was drafted for military service during the Vietnam War and served in Germany in the late 1960s. After leaving the military, he worked as a baker and steelworker in Youngstown before going on to earn a degree in urban studies from the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University in 1975. He then worked as a social worker in Youngstown.

==Political career==
In 1978, Hagan became chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, beating Garfield Heights ward leader Henry S. Trubiano. In that position, he became one of the first Democrats to endorse Edward M. Kennedy in the 1980 presidential election over the sitting Democratic President Jimmy Carter. Prior to his endorsement, Hagan had been a guest of Kennedy at his home in Hyannisport.

Hagan was appointed Cuyahoga County&#x27;s county recorder, but he failed to keep the seat in an election. He then ran for a seat on the Cuyahoga County board of commissioners, losing to Republican Virgil Brown. He ran again in 1981, this time successfully. Hagan served on the county commission for 16 years (1982–1998).

In 1989, Hagan made an unsuccessful attempt for the office of mayor of Cleveland, losing the Democratic primary to Ohio State Senator Michael R. White, who went on to defeat Cleveland City Council President George L. Forbes in the general election. In 1992, with White&#x27;s endorsement, Hagan made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing in the Democratic primary to incumbent U.S. Rep. Mary Rose Oakar.

Hagan described himself as an avowed liberal, ingrained by his father&#x27;s politics, and expressed regret at the conservative trend in the Democratic Party in the 1990s. He was known to quote Albert Camus in his speeches, a habit that did not earn him the affection of blue-collar voters. However, he allowed for compromises with his innate liberalism, agreeing to go along with government funding for the Cleveland Gateway project, which included the construction of Jacobs Field and Gund Arena.

Hagan has received praise from both sides of the political aisle. Republican Jim Petro, the state auditor and former fellow county commissioner, called him &quot;the most honorable politician I&#x27;ve ever known&quot;. He even earned the friendship of former rival Forbes, who, during the 1989 election, had described Hagan as a &quot;pimp&quot;.

Hagan ran into political trouble when it was revealed that Cuyahoga County Treasurer Francis E. Gaul (famous for saying that &quot;Most people in Cleveland think Camus is the whale at SeaWorld,&quot; in reference to Hagan) had made risky investments using county funds, having assured the Board of Commissioners that the Secured Assets Fund Earnings fund was free of risk. Hagan was called as a witness for the defense in Gaul&#x27;s trial, saying that he had &quot;implicitly&quot; trusted Gaul&#x27;s reassurances that the investments were safe.

It was 1994, however, and the booming economy mitigated the county treasury&#x27;s losses and Hagan managed to win re-election to the board of commissioners.

In 1996, Hagan announced that he would retire from electoral politics after his term expired at the end of 1998, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m in the twilight of a mediocre career. But I&#x27;m looking forward to going to the grocery store without someone asking me for a job.&quot;

In 2002, he ran for the office of Governor of Ohio and lost to the incumbent Republican, Robert A. Taft III. Hagan&#x27;s campaign against Taft using a duck quacking &quot;Taftquack&quot; raised trademark issues with the American Family Life Insurance Company&#x27;s trademarked &quot;AFLAC&quot; quacking duck. The federal court in the Northern District of Ohio found that Hagan&#x27;s commercial neither infringed nor diluted the AFLAC mark. 266 F. Supp. 2d 682.

In February 2004, Hagan announced his intention to run again for a seat on the Cuyahoga County commission against fellow Democrat and former colleague, Tim McCormack. Hagan easily defeated McCormack in the Democratic primary election and faced no Republican opposition in the November 2004 general election. In November 2008, he was re-elected to the Cuyahoga County commission without opposition.

In November 2009, the voters of Cuyahoga County voted to change its governmental structure. Hagan retired as Cuyahoga County Commissioner in 2011, when the county switched to an Executive-Council form of government.

==Personal life==

In 1973, Hagan married Jeanne Marie Carney. Carney&#x27;s father, John Carney, a successful property developer and later judge, helped Hagan to get his start in Democratic politics in his brother James Carney&#x27;s 1971 campaign for mayor of Cleveland. They had two daughters, Eleanor and Marie. They divorced in 1995. In 1999, Hagan married actress Kate Mulgrew. As of 2014, they had divorced.

Hagan has a close relationship with members of the Kennedy family—he is a godfather to Katherine Kennedy Townsend, one of Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s grandchildren, and was a pallbearer at the funeral of Stephen E. Smith, the late husband of Jean Kennedy Smith.

Hagan&#x27;s father, Robert E. Hagan, served as a county commissioner on the board of commissioners of Trumbull County, Ohio, and in the Ohio General Assembly. Hagan&#x27;s brother Robert F. Hagan was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives.

<doc id="709285" wikidata="Q7274066" url="?curid=709285" title="R. U. Sirius">
<text>R. U. Sirius (born Ken Goffman in 1952) is an American writer, editor, talk show host, musician and cyberculture celebrity. He is best known as co-founder of &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; magazine and its original editor-in-chief from 1989 to 1993.

Sirius has written for &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Wired News&quot;, &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, &quot;Artforum&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot; and many other publications.

==Activities==

===1980s===
From 1984 onward, Sirius edited a counterculture magazine that started as &quot;High Frontiers&quot; with a focus on recreational drug use. In 1988 it was renamed &quot;Reality Hackers&quot; to reflect increased content about digital culture issues. The following year it became &quot;Mondo 2000&quot;.

===1990s===
Sirius left &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; in 1993, and the magazine folded in 1998 after 17 issues.

In 1993, Sirius was quoted in &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine about the internet and its future. This July 1993 piece, &quot;The Whole World is Talking&quot;, was &quot;The Nation&quot;″s first article about the internet.

Sirius recruited Timothy Leary to be a contributing editor for &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; and taught an online course in Leary&#x27;s philosophy for the Maybe Logic Academy. He co-authored Leary&#x27;s last book, &quot;Design for Dying&quot; (1998), and wrote the introduction for a 1998 edition of Leary&#x27;s 1968 book &quot;The Politics of Ecstasy&quot;.

Sirius appeared in the films &quot;Synthetic Pleasures&quot; (1995) and &quot;Conceiving Ada&quot; (1997). His mid-1990s techno-rock band Mondo Vanilli recorded an unreleased CD titled &quot;IOU Babe&quot; for Trent Reznor&#x27;s Nothing Records. The music is available on Bandcamp IOU Babe, by Mondo Vanilli.

Sirius spoke at many events, such as the Starwood Festival . He delivered the second Keynote address for the Virtual Reality conference, Oslo VR, in 1994.

===2000s===
Sirius was chairman and candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election for the Revolution Party. The party&#x27;s 20-point platform was a hybrid of libertarianism and liberalism.

During the 2000s Sirius published four books. In 2005 he began hosting two weekly podcasts, the &quot;RU Sirius Show&quot; and &quot;NeoFiles&quot;. Both went on unannounced hiatus in August 2007 because their financial backer withdrew his support. In September 2006 Sirius helped launch the webzine &quot;10 Zen Monkeys&quot; with fellow GettingIt.com alumni Jeff Diehl and Lou Cabron.

From October 2008 to May 2010, Sirius was head editor of the transhumanist magazine &quot;H+ Magazine&quot;. He then turned his attention to a project documenting the history of &quot;Mondo 2000&quot;.

===2010s===
From June 2011 to November 2012, R. U. Sirius ran &quot;Acceler8or&quot;, a counterculture, Singularitarian/Transhumanist website. &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; was briefly relaunched online in 2017.

<doc id="709287" wikidata="Q1359690" url="?curid=709287" title="Wickes-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers were a class of 111 destroyers built by the United States Navy in 1917–19. Together with the six preceding and following 156 subsequent s, they were grouped as the &quot;flush-deck&quot; or &quot;four-stack&quot; type. Only a few were completed in time to serve in World War I, including , the lead ship of the class.

While some were scrapped in the 1930s, the rest served throughout World War II. Most of these were converted to other uses; nearly all in U.S. service had half their boilers and one or more stacks removed to increase fuel and range or accommodate troops. Others were transferred to the British Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy, some of which were later transferred to the Soviet Navy. All were scrapped within a few years after World War II.

== Background ==
The destroyer type was at this time a relatively new class of fighting ship for the U.S. Navy. The type arose in response to torpedo boats that had been developing from 1865, especially after the development of the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo. During the Spanish–American War, it was realized that a torpedo boat destroyer was urgently needed to screen the larger warships, so much so that a special war plans board headed by Theodore Roosevelt issued an urgent report pleading for this type of ship.

A series of destroyers had been built over the preceding years, designed for high smooth water speed, with indifferent results, especially poor performance in heavy seas and poor fuel economy. The lesson of these early destroyers was the appreciation of the need for true seakeeping and seagoing abilities. There were few cruisers in the Navy, which was a fleet of battleships and destroyers (no cruisers had been launched since 1908) so destroyers performed scouting missions. A report in October 1915 by Captain W. S. Sims noted that the smaller destroyers used fuel far too quickly, and that wargames showed the need for fast vessels with a larger radius of action. As a result, the size of U.S. destroyers increased steadily, starting at 450 tons and rising to over 1,000 tons between 1905 and 1916. The need for high speed, economical cruising, heavy seas performance, and a high fuel capacity saw larger hulls, the inclusion of oil fuel, reduction geared steam turbines with cruising turbines, and increased fuel capacity.

With World War I then in its second year and tensions between the U.S. and Germany increasing, the U.S. needed to expand its navy. The Naval Appropriation Act of 1916 called for a navy &quot;second to none,&quot; capable of protecting both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The Act authorized the construction of ten battleships, six s, ten scout cruisers, and 50 &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers. A subsequent General Board recommendation for further destroyers to combat the submarine threat resulted in a total of 267 &quot;Wickes&quot;- and &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers completed. However, the design of the ships remained optimized for operation with the battleship fleet.

== Design ==
The requirements of the new design were high speed and mass production. The development of submarine warfare during World War I created a requirement for destroyers in numbers that had not been contemplated before the war. A top speed of was needed for operation with the &quot;Lexington-class&quot; battlecruisers and &quot;Omaha-class&quot; cruisers.

The final design had a flush deck and four smokestacks. It was a fairly straightforward evolution of the preceding &quot;Caldwell&quot; class. General dissatisfaction with the earlier &quot;1,000 ton&quot; designs (&quot;Cassin&quot; and &quot;Tucker&quot; classes) led to the fuller hull form of the &quot;flush deck&quot; type. Greater beam and the flush deck provided greater hull strength. In addition, the &quot;Wickes&quot; class had - more than the &quot;Caldwell&quot; class - providing an extra . The machinery arrangement of some of the &quot;Caldwell&quot;s was used, with geared steam turbines on two shafts.

The extra power required an extra 100 tons of engine and reduction gears. The design included an even keel and nearly horizontal propeller shafts to minimize weight.

As construction was undertaken by ten different builders, there was considerable variation in the types of boilers and turbines installed to meet a guaranteed speed requirement. However, there were in essence two basic designs; one for the ships built by the Bethlehem Steel yards (including Union Iron Works) and another used by the remaining shipyards, which was prepared by Bath Iron Works.

The &quot;Wickes&quot; class proved to be short-ranged, and its bridge and gun positions were very wet. The fleet found that the tapered stern, which made for a nice depth charge deployment feature, dug into the water and increased the turning radius, thus hampering anti-submarine work. The &quot;Clemson&quot; class added 100 tons of fuel tankage to improve operational range, but the issue of range was solved only with the development of underway replenishment in World War II.

== Armament ==

The main armament was the same as the &quot;Caldwell&quot; class: four /50 caliber guns and twelve torpedo tubes. While the gun armament was typical for destroyers of this period, the torpedo armament was larger than usual, in accordance with American practice at the time. A factor in the size of the torpedo armament was the General Board&#x27;s decision to use broadside rather than centerline torpedo tubes. This was due to the desire to have some torpedoes remaining after firing a broadside, and problems experienced with centerline mounts on previous classes with torpedoes striking the gunwales of the firing ship. The Mark 8 torpedo was initially equipped, and probably remained the standard torpedo for this class, as 600 Mark 8 torpedoes were issued to the British in 1940 as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.

Most ships carried a /23 caliber anti-aircraft (AA) gun, typically just aft of the stern 4-inch gun. The original design called for two 1-pounder AA guns, but these were in short supply and the 3-inch gun was more effective. Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) armament was added during World War I. Typically, a single depth charge track was provided aft, along with a Y-gun depth charge projector forward of the aft deckhouse.

== Production ==
The United States Congress authorized 50 destroyers in the 1916 Act. However, the realization of the scope of the U-boat campaign resulted in 111 being built. The ships were built at Bath Iron Works, Bethlehem Steel Corporation&#x27;s Fore River Shipbuilding Company, Union Iron Works, Mare Island Navy Yard, Newport News Shipbuilding, New York Shipbuilding, and William Cramp &amp; Sons. 267 &quot;Wickes&quot; and &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyers were built. This program was considered a major industrial achievement. Production of these destroyers was considered so important that work on cruisers and battleships was delayed to allow completion of the program. The first &quot;Wickes&quot;-class vessel was launched on 11 November 1917, with four more by the end of the year. Production peaked in July 1918, when 17 were launched - 15 of them on 4 July.
The program continued after the war ended: 21 of the &quot;Wickes&quot; class (and all but 9 of the &quot;Clemson&quot; class) were launched after the armistice on 11 November 1918. The last of the &quot;Wickes&quot; class was launched on 24 July 1919. This program left the U.S. Navy with so many destroyers that no new destroyers were built until 1932 (the ).

== Ships in class ==
111 &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers were built.

=== Sub-classes ===
Some of these ships are also referred to as &quot;Little&quot; class (52 ships), &quot;Lamberton&quot; class (11 ships), or &quot;Tattnall&quot; class (10 ships) to signify the yard that built them and to note the slight design differences from the Bath Iron Works ships. Some of these non-Bath Iron Works units were actually commissioned prior to the lead ship, &quot;Wickes&quot;.

== Operations ==

=== In U.S. service ===
A few &quot;Wickes&quot; class were completed in time for service in World War I, some with the battle fleet, some on convoy escort duty; none were lost. ran aground in 1921; sank after a collision in 1921.

Many &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers were converted to other uses, starting as early as 1920, when 14 were converted to light minelayers (hull classification symbol DM). Six of these were scrapped in 1932, and replaced by five additional conversions. Another four were converted to auxiliaries or transports at that time. Four &quot;Wickes&quot;-class DM conversions and four &quot;Clemson&quot;-class DM conversions survived to serve in World War II. During the 1930s, 23 more were scrapped, sold off, or sunk as targets. This was mostly due to a blanket replacement of 61 Yarrow-boilered destroyers 1930–31, as these boilers wore out quickly in service. Flush-deckers in reserve were commissioned as replacements.

Starting in 1940, many of the remaining ships were also converted. Sixteen were converted to high-speed transports with the designation APD. Eight were converted to destroyer minesweepers (DMS). Most ships remaining in service during World War II were rearmed with dual-purpose /50 caliber guns for better anti-aircraft protection. The AVD seaplane tender conversions received two guns; the APD transport, DM minelayer, and DMS minesweeper conversions received three guns, and those retaining destroyer classification received six. Half of the torpedo tubes were removed in those retained as destroyers; all torpedoes were removed from the others. Nearly all had half the boilers removed, for increased fuel and range or to accommodate troops, reducing their speed to .

The low-angle Mark 9 4-inch guns removed from these ships were transferred to defensively equipped merchant ships for anti-submarine protection.

 had an eventful career. She was built in record time: her keel was laid on 15 May 1918, launched only 17 days later on 1 June 1918, and commissioned 54 days after that on 24 July 1918. She is credited with firing the first US shots of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, sinking a Japanese midget submarine with gunfire before the air attack started. The sinking was uncertain until the submarine&#x27;s wreck was discovered in 2002. As the high-speed transport APD-16, she was damaged beyond repair by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 7 December 1944, and was sunk after abandoning ship by gunfire from the destroyer , commanded at the time by &quot;Ward&quot;″s former CO from the Pearl Harbor attack.

Thirteen &quot;Wickes&quot; class were lost during World War II in U.S. service. The remainder were scrapped between 1945 and 1947.

=== In foreign navies ===
Twenty-three &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy, and four to the Royal Canadian Navy, in 1940 under the Destroyers-for-bases deal. Together with ships from the &quot;Caldwell&quot; and &quot;Clemson&quot; classes they were grouped as &#x27;Town-class destroyers&#x27;; divided into the Bath Iron Works design as &quot;Type B&quot; and the Bethlehem Steel as &quot;Type C&quot; Most of these ships were refitted much like the U.S. destroyers and used as convoy escorts, but some were used very little and were not considered worth refitting. , renamed , was disguised as a German vessel and expended as a blockship in the St Nazaire Raid. (A newer that was involved in the Japanese surrender formalities was a later ship.) One further destroyer was sunk; the remainder were scrapped between 1944 and 1947.

In 1944 seven were transferred by Britain to the Soviet Navy, in place of Italian ships claimed by the USSR after Italy&#x27;s surrender. These vessels all survived the war, and were scrapped between 1949 and 1952.

<text>Panjab University (PU) is an Indian collegiate public state university located in Chandigarh. Funded through both State and Union governments, it is considered a state university. It traces its origins to the University of the Punjab in Lahore, which was founded in 1882. After the partition of India, the university was established on 1 October 1947, and called East Punjab University. Initially housed primarily at a cantonment in Solan, it later relocated to a newly built campus in Chandigarh, and was renamed Panjab University. It is accredited by NAAC at five star level, with the highest NAAC A++ accreditation grade.

The university has 78 teaching and research departments and 10 centres/chairs for teaching and research at the main campus located at Chandigarh. It has 201 affiliated colleges spread over the eight districts of Punjab state and union-territory of Chandigarh, with Regional Centres at Muktsar, Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur. It is one of the well-ranked universities in India.

The campus is residential, spread over in sectors 14 and 25 of the city of Chandigarh. The main administrative and academic buildings are located in sector 14, beside a health centre, a sports complex, hostels and residential housing.

==History==
The University of the Punjab was established on 14 October 1882 at Lahore (now in Punjab, Pakistan). The fate of the university after the partition of India in 1947, was deliberated at the Punjab Partition Committee, with representatives from East Punjab advocating for a division of the university. The senate of the university voted to split the university, and the matter reached the Partition Council at the centre, but a decision could not be made. With no university for the colleges in its territory, the government in East Punjab was compelled to bring an ordinance to set up a new university on 27 September 1947. The new university was then established in Solan (Shimla) of the Indian Punjab as the &quot;East Punjab University&quot; on 1 October 1947. After 1947, the university had no campus of its own for nearly a decade. The administrative office was in Solan and the teaching departments functioned from Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Delhi, and Amritsar. The name was later shortened to Panjab University in 1950.

In 1956 the university was relocated to Chandigarh, on a red sandstone campus designed by Pierre Jeanneret under the guidance of Le Corbusier. Until the re-organisation of Punjab in 1966, the university had its regional centres at Rohtak, Shimla, Jalandhar and its affiliated colleges were in the present-day states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. With the re-organisation of Punjab, the university became an Inter-State Body Corporate catering to the newly organised state of Punjab and the union-territory of Chandigarh.

In April 2024, Panjab University in Chandigarh became one of the first universities in India to grant menstrual leave to female students, starting from the session 2024-25. The policy will allow leave of one day per one calendar month of teaching and maximum of four days leave per semester.

<doc id="709289" wikidata="Q177675" url="?curid=709289" title="Opel Ascona">
<text>The Opel Ascona is a large family car (D-segment in Europe) that was produced by the German automaker Opel from 1970 to 1988. It was produced in three separate generations, beginning with rear-wheel-drive and ending up as a front-wheel drive J-car derivative. The Ascona was developed to fill the gap in the Opel range as the Opel Rekord was gradually growing in size.

The Ascona took its name from the lakeside resort of that name in Ticino, Switzerland, and already in the 1950s a special edition of the Opel Rekord P1 was sold as an Opel Ascona in Switzerland, where the name was again used in 1968 for a locally adapted version of the Opel Kadett B into which the manufacturers had persuaded a 1.7-litre engine borrowed from the larger Rekord model of the time. The Opel Ascona A launched in 1970 and sold across Europe was, however, the first mainstream Opel model to carry the name — departing from Opel&#x27;s long standing convention of using German naval rank designations for its models.

The Ascona was introduced in September 1970, lasting for 18 years and 3 generations and ended production in August 1988, to be replaced by the Opel Vectra A. The second and third generations of the Ascona were developed as global platforms by Opel&#x27;s then parent General Motors, with various derivative versions manufactured by other GM divisions around the world.

In motorsport, Walter Röhrl won the 1982 World Rally Championship drivers&#x27; title with an Ascona 400.


== Ascona A (1970–1975)==
In the fall of 1970, Opel presented its completely new vehicle range in Rüsselsheim (internal project code 1.450). The Opel Manta coupé was launched on September 9, followed by the Opel Ascona on October 28 in two- and four-door saloon forms, plus a three-door estate called the Caravan or Voyage. These models were positioned between the existing Opel Kadett and the Opel Rekord, and unlike later Asconas — there was no Vauxhall sister model.

The Ascona was developed as a replacement to the Kadett, but late in the car&#x27;s development Opel chose to instead develop a new, smaller Kadett and instead positioned the Ascona as a competitor to the successful Ford mid-sized Taunus range. The Opel Ascona A stayed in production until 1975. By that time, almost 692,000 vehicles of the first series had been produced.

The range featured petrol engines from 1.2 L to 1.9 L, with power between . The 1.2 L had an overhead valve (OHV) head, while the 1.6 L and 1.9 L featured the Opel cam-in-head engine (CIH). The CIH was a compromise effort, with the camshaft mounted next to the valves rather than above them. All used a single barrel carburetor. Even with this simple design, the Ascona 1.9 SR had a successful career in motorsports, with Walter Röhrl winning the European Rally Championship in 1974. Tuner Steinmetz developed a special version of the Ascona SR, with two single-barrel Solex carburettors, raising power to .

;Engines
*&quot;1.2 S&quot; – 1,196 cc, 
*&quot;1.6 N&quot; – 1,584 cc, 
*&quot;1.6 S&quot; – 1,584 cc, 
*&quot;1.9 S&quot; – 1,897 cc, 

===Opel 1900 (US)===
From 1971 to 1975, the 1.9-litre Ascona was exported to the United States as the &quot;Opel 1900&quot; and marketed at Buick-Opel dealerships. Originally two- and four-door saloons were offered, the former dropped after model year 1973. For 1974, rubber-clad impact bumpers were added in response to federal regulations. All Opels sold in the US in 1975 were equipped with Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection, not available on the European versions, to comply with stricter US emissions requirements. The compression ratio was dropped to 7.6:1, enabling the car to run on 91-octane unleaded gasoline but also lowering maximum power to at 4800 rpm.

Due to the unfavorable Deutsche Mark to US dollar exchange rate, all Opels in Buick showrooms were replaced by the Japanese-built Isuzu Geminis wearing Opel badges after 1975.

== Ascona B (1975–1981)==
The second generation Opel Ascona B was presented in August 1975 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. It was available as a two or four-door saloon. There were related two and three-door coupé models in the Opel Manta range. There was no estate (&quot;Caravan&quot;) body available. It was Opel&#x27;s version of the &quot;U-car&quot; platform (&quot;extended subcompact&quot; — therefore unrelated to the later GM U-platform), and was essentially an enlarged version of the T-Car platform which underpinned the smaller Opel Kadett C and Vauxhall Chevette.

The Ascona B retained the same engine range as its predecessor, versions with higher compression ratio and needing 98 octane petrol, dubbed S, were available alongside the 90 octane models. The first change took place in January 1976, when laminated window glass became available as a no-cost option. The 1.9 L &quot;S&quot; cam-in-head engine was replaced by the modernised 2.0 L (20S) in September 1977. The 20N became available in January 1978, and all models now also received electric windscreen washers. A 2.0 L diesel motor was added to the Ascona B range in 1978, mostly targeted at the Benelux countries and Italy, where local tax structures provided an incentive for diesel-powered automobiles — in 1979, 97% of diesels were exported, while 59% of petrol powered cars went in the export.

By the end of 1978 the 1.6 S engine was discontinued in Germany (where it was replaced by the 19N, with the same power but lower fuel consumption), but continued to be available in some markets in a somewhat detuned version with . In January 1979 the street legal version of the Ascona 400 with 2.4-litre engine (16 valves, 144 PS) appeared, followed a month later by the more prosaic 1.3-litre OHC engine. This largely replaced the old 1.2-litre pushrod unit which dated back to 1962, but production continued in dwindling numbers into 1980 for some export markets.

In September 1979 the Ascona received a minor facelift, including plastic bumpers and a grey front grille with a larger mesh. The 2.0 E engine with a Bosch L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection arrived in January 1980, after having been first installed in the Manta and Rekord models. The 2.0 E equipped Ascona also received an upgraded clutch shared with the sporting Manta GT/E. In January 1981 the Ascona underwent its last changes, when adjustments made to the 16N and 20N engines. The 1.9 N and 2.0 N engines were discontinued in the German market, while the 1.6 N engine was now only available coupled with an automatic transmission.

Over 1.2 million Ascona B units were produced worldwide until August 1981. The two millionth Ascona was an Ascona B, built in April 1980, and the one millionth Ascona sold in Germany was registered in July of that same year. The related Manta coupé versions however, remained in production until 1988.

===Export models===
In the United Kingdom, the Vauxhall Cavalier badge was used on both saloon and coupé models from late 1975, which came out of the same factory in Belgium — the first Vauxhall to be built abroad. The front ends were different, featuring Vauxhall&#x27;s trademark &quot;droop snoot&quot;, as designed by Wayne Cherry.

; South Africa
In South Africa there was a locally assembled version called the Chevrolet Ascona, identical in many respects to the four-door Opel Ascona B. The Ascona came with a locally built 1.3-litre inline-four from the Vauxhall Viva. A preceding upmarket version with the Vauxhall Cavalier&#x27;s longer front end was sold as the Chevrolet Chevair, equipped with bigger engines of Chevrolet origins. The Ascona was launched in July 1978, and replaced the Vauxhall-based Chevrolet 1300/1900-series. It was available in De Luxe or S trim, with the S receiving a sportier treatment with a three-spoke steering wheel, tartan seat inserts, and Rostyle rims.

=== Ascona 400 rally car===
First shown at Frankfurt in September 1979, the Ascona 400 was a homologation special sold only to make it eligible for rallying&#x27;s Group 4 category. The Ascona 400s were built at General Motors&#x27; plant in Antwerp. The 1980 world champion Walter Röhrl took the rally car to victory and won the World Rally Championship drivers&#x27; title in the 1982 season.

The car was developed by Opel alongside the Manta B 400 model which consisted of the same changes. Irmscher and Cosworth were hired as partners for the project, Cosworth to deliver a 16 valve double cam crossflow head for the engine, and Irmscher for the exterior and interior styling. Cosworth delivered the heads to Opel and Opel soon discovered a major mistake. The plan was to use the 2.0-litre engine block but this did not produce enough power. Time was running out and Opel badly needed to do something. Opel took the 2.0E block, installed forged pistons, different connecting-rods, and forged crankshaft with 85mm stroke. The result was a 2.4-litre engine. The 2.4-litre engine gave rise to some massive power outputs using the 16 valve head. The street versions of the 400 therefore came with engines, using the Bosch fuel injection of the Manta GSi and GT/E series. However, in race trim they were delivered putting out , which could be improved further to , while still using normally aspirated engine components.

Irmscher delivered the rally trim for the exterior. Large and widened wings, light weight hood, front wings, rear boot lid and doors were also installed.

By 1984, the Audi Quattro appeared more powerful than ever and the Ascona 400 was rendered obsolete. But the Ascona 400 still has some remarkable records. The Ascona 400 was the last rear wheel drive rally car to win the drivers&#x27; world championship, ensuring its place in motorsports history.

====WRC victories====

== Ascona C (1981–1988)==

The Ascona C was launched in August 1981 as part of General Motors&#x27; J-car project. This was Opel&#x27;s second front-wheel drive car since the introduction of the Kadett D in 1979. This car was manufactured in Rüsselsheim, Germany, Antwerp, Belgium, São Caetano do Sul, Brazil and Luton, England, and was sold in the UK under the name Vauxhall Cavalier and as the Chevrolet Monza in Latin America. The Cavalier Coupé was phased out, but the Opel Manta was retained in the UK (the last car to be badged as an Opel in the UK before the brand was phased out there in 1988). There were no longer sheet metal differences between Opel and Vauxhall models after 1982. The Ascona C won the &quot;Goldenes Lenkrad&quot; (Golden Steering Wheel) award at the end of 1981 and was West Germany&#x27;s biggest selling car. The new Ascona no longer had the sporty character of its predecessors, being a more unadulterated family car which was considerably more space-efficient than earlier models.

It was narrowly beaten to the European Car of the Year award by the Renault 9 in 1982. It took another 27 years before its successor model, the Opel Insignia, won the 2009 European Car of the Year award by only 1 point, from the Second placed Ford Fiesta. The Ascona C underwent two notable facelifts during its term of production.

The range added an option of a five-door fastback/hatchback Bodystyle, named CC in a few markets — short for &quot;Combi Coupé.&quot; The hatchback model was shorter than the saloons, with a marginally smaller luggage compartment and less headspace in the backseat. All engines were now SOHC crossflow designs with a breakerless ignition system and hydraulic tappets. The base model was the 1.3 L introduced in 1978 in the Ascona B, with , followed by a 1.6 L with . &quot;S&quot; versions with higher compression ratio had power increased by as much as twenty per cent. The top of the line was the sporty GTE model, with electronic fuel injection, pushing power to in the last two model years. Diesel power came from an 1.6SH derived block, with 1.6-litres. Catalytic converters were optional in the larger petrol units starting from 1986.

The Ascona C was also assembled in South Africa, where it was sold by GM South Africa, replacing the Chevrolet Ascona which was based on the Ascona B. It was dropped in 1986 and replaced by a saloon version of the Kadett E called the Opel Monza.

As before, there was no estate car version of the Ascona, although Vauxhall in the UK brought in the rear ends of the Holden Camira wagon (estate car) and adapted them to the Cavalier beginning with the 1984 model year. Opel continued to use the Ascona nameplate until the Vectra was launched in 1988, while the Cavalier name was retained by Vauxhall until 1995.

; Timeline
*September 1981 — Introduction of the Ascona C as the successor for the Ascona B. This, the original version, is usually referred to as &quot;C1&quot; to distinguish it from the later, facelifted versions. Available bodystyles for the Ascona included 2- and 4-door saloons and a 5-door hatchback (the CC). Initial engine choice included the 1.3N (60 PS), 1.3S (75 PS), 1.6N (75 PS) and 1.6S (90 PS), all of which had a four-speed gearbox or optional three-speed automatic transmission for all except the 1.3 N. Trim variations included Base, Luxus, Berlina, and SR.
*1982 — Introduction of the Ascona Diesel with a 1.6 (55 PS) engine, available with a five-speed gearbox. Introduction of the Ascona CD with higher level of equipment. A new 1.8E engine with LE-Jetronic (115 PS) and five-speed gearbox is introduced in September. Optional power steering, electric windows, electric mirrors and computer available at extra cost. The five-speed transmission was now also made available in the 1.6S. Introduction of Chevrolet Monza in Brazil, with a 1.6 engine and 3 door hatchback body style. Later the 1.8 engine was made available.
*1983 — Modified ignition switch and door locks. Improvements made to water pump, valve seals and radiator hoses. Aftermarket convertibles were now available from Keinath (later also by Hammond &amp; Thiede). Optional central locking and heated mirrors. Optional Sports suspension available for SR and 1.8 E engine. Automatically adjustable rear brakes now standard. As of May, the five-speed transmission was available in all models. Introduction of 2 and 4 door saloon bodystyle in Brazil.
*1984 — C2: All models have a facelift with new CD-style radiator grille, new wheel trims, new front seat mountings, modified centre console, remote-adjustable door mirrors and height-adjustable steering wheel. 1.3S engine now has a new start-stop system. Improved clutch damping and headlight seals. Model names also changed: Base becomes LS, L becomes GL, Berlina becomes GLS, and SR becomes GT.
*1985 — 1.8i engine with three-way catalyst introduced (100 PS). This engine was built in Rüsselsheim and only installed in cars built in that plant, meaning that it was not available in the two-door bodywork as that style was only manufactured in Antwerp. One-way catalysts are available for all engines. Modified clutch lining and door seals.
*1986 – C3: All models are facelifted, this time with clear front indicator lenses, dark taillight lenses with fewer ridges, colour-keyed radiator grille, air vent, and front spoiler. GT now has front and rear spoilers. New engines were also available: 1.6i and 2.0i with three-way catalysts. The 1.6i has Multec-central Injection system and , while the 2.0i has Bosch Motronic Injection system and , with or without catalyst (20NE/C20NE). The 1.3 was no longer available in the German market.
*1987 — Non-catalyst 2.0i replaced by 20SEH version, only available with GT trim. Introduction of 2.0 engine in Brazil.
*1988 — The GL model changes name to &quot;Touring&quot; (already used in 1986 for the last of the C2 Ascona&#x27;s). August marks the end of production for the Ascona C, replaced by the Opel Vectra A.
*1990 — 2 and 4 door saloon models are facelifted in Brazil.
*1991 — Electronic fuel injection is adopted in Brazil.
*1996 — End of production in Brazil.

; Models
The following versions of the Ascona C were available, all with inline fours. Data is for the German market. There were certain differences in various export market models:


===Chevrolet Monza===
In Brazil, the Ascona C was sold from May 1982 until August 1996 as the Chevrolet Monza. Chevrolet did not use the Ascona brand because the Spanish and Portuguese word &quot;asco&quot; means &quot;disgust, repugnance&quot;. Instead, it was named after the famous Italian circuit.

It was originally only available as a three-door hatchback, a body style unique to Latin America. However, two and four-door saloons appeared in March 1983. GM do Brasil also considered offering the Monza as an estate car, and produced two full-size clay models, one with five doors and one with three doors, with a similar rear to the Holden Camira in Australia, which was also used as the basis of the Vauxhall Cavalier in the UK, but it never entered into production. However, Envemo began converting the four-door Monza saloon into an estate called the Camping, although it retained the rear doors and taillights of the saloon. Envemo also converted the two-door Monza saloon into a convertible. In 1989 the slow-selling liftback was discontinued, leaving only the two- and four-door three-box saloons. 

Originally it was available with either a 1.6- or 1.8-litre engine with . These were changed to more powerful 1.8 and 2.0s in 1986.

The Monza received a number of facelifts, the last one bringing its looks in line with those of current European GM products, with new fenders front and rear to accommodate new head and taillights. Diesel versions were available for export markets, most notably Uruguay and Argentina, powered by Isuzu&#x27;s 4EC1 engine.

The Monza first went on sale in Colombia in 1985 in a 4-door saloon body style, assembled locally by GM Colmotores. In Colombia, a top of the line saloon version was sold from 1987 to 1992 as the Monza Classic with a three-speed automatic transmission. In Venezuela it was assembled and sold from 1985 to 1990. Originally it was equipped with a carbureted 1.8-litre engine, but this was later replaced with a fuel-injected 2-litre unit.

<text>Lee Irwin Fisher (born August 7, 1951) is an American attorney, politician, and academic. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 64th lieutenant governor of Ohio under governor Ted Strickland from 2007 until 2011. Fisher previously served as the 44th attorney general of Ohio from 1991 to 1995. He unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010.

Fisher has served as Dean of Cleveland State University College of Law since 2017. In 2025, he was named to serve as President of Baldwin Wallace University.

==Early life and education==
Fisher graduated from Oberlin College in 1973 and earned a Juris Doctor from the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in 1976. He graduated from the Weatherhead School of Management Professional Fellows Program in 1996. In 2004, he received his master&#x27;s degree in nonprofit organization from the Case Western Reserve University Mandel Center for Nonprofit Organizations.

==Legal career==
After graduation from law school, Fisher was a law clerk for Judge Paul C. Weick of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit from 1976 to 1977. In 1978, was an instructor in legal research, writing, and advocacy at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law and joined the Cleveland law firm of Hahn Loeser &amp; Parks LLP. Fisher remained as of counsel to the law firm until his 1990 election as Ohio Attorney General; he rejoined as a partner in 1995 and remained until he was selected CEO of the Center for Families and Children in 1999.

==Political career==
At the age of 29, Fisher was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1980. He served as a state representative for two years before being elected to the Ohio Senate in 1982. He was named &quot; Outstanding Freshman Legislator&quot; by Columbus Monthly magazine in 1982. In 1983 he was named a Chase Public Leadership Fellow and attended the Harvard Program for Senior Executives in State and Local Government.

Fisher was elected Attorney General of Ohio in 1990, defeating Paul Pfeifer in the only statewide election in Ohio history to trigger a statewide recount. In 1992, Fisher was elected a presidential elector for Ohio. Fisher served as attorney general from 1991 to 1995, narrowly losing his bid for re-election in 1994 to Republican Betty Montgomery. In 1998, Fisher ran for governor but lost to Republican Bob Taft, 50%–45%.

Joining the ticket of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ted Strickland, Fisher was elected lieutenant governor in 2006. The Ohio gubernatorial campaign was captured in the 2008 documentary film &quot;Swing State&quot;, which was directed by (his son) Jason Zone-Fisher, John Intrater, and H. Spencer Young.

===2010 U.S. Senate campaign===

In February 2009, Fisher announced his campaign to replace George Voinovich in the U.S. Senate.

On May 4, 2010, Fisher won the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, defeating Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner.

In the general election on November 2, 2010, Fisher faced the Republican nominee, Rob Portman, a former Cincinnati congressman and Bush administration official. Portman received 57% of the votes to Fisher&#x27;s 39%. Fisher carried only six of Ohio&#x27;s 88 counties and three of 18 congressional districts.

==Academic career==
In 2016, Fisher was appointed interim dean of Cleveland State University&#x27;s Cleveland–Marshall College of Law (now the Cleveland State University College of Law) for the 2016–17 academic year. On May 3, 2017, Fisher was named permanent dean after a national search. Fisher&#x27;s tenure focused on leadership in the law, establishing the Cleveland-Marshall Hall of Fame, increased fundraising, and raising the school&#x27;s national profile. Beginning in 2018, Fisher began teaching a course on leadership and helped establish the P. Kelly Tompkins Leadership and Law Program.

On February 10, 2025, Fisher was named the 10th president of Baldwin Wallace University, effective July 1, 2025. The appointment came after a national search. Upon accepting the position, Fisher emphasized BW&#x27;s commitment to career readiness, character development, and affordable education as key institutional priorities.

==Personal life==

<doc id="709299" wikidata="Q770212" url="?curid=709299" title="Annianus of Alexandria">
<text>Annianus of Alexandria () was a monk and writer who flourished in Alexandria during the pontificate of Theophilus I around the beginning of the 5thcentury.

Annianus criticized the world history of his contemporary, the monk Panodorus of Alexandria, for relying too much on secular sources rather than biblical sources for his dates. As a result, he developed his own chronology which placed Creation on . This created the Alexandrian era whose first day was the first day of the Alexandrian civil year in progress, . This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning , which itself was four 19-year cycles after the epoch of the Diocletian Era on . The former is known as the Era of Grace in the Coptic Church, whereas the latter is known as the Era of Martyrs. He was the first computist to recognize the 532-year cycle of Easters in the Julian calendar. This cycle is often attributed to Victorius of Aquitaine in 457, the first to recognize such a cycle in the West.

None of Annianus&#x27;s writings have survived. He is principally known from the discussion of his works by George Syncellus during the 9th century, though lesser fragments appear elsewhere. Elijah of Nisibis cites him in his 11th-century &quot;Chronography&quot;.

However, Annianus’ Paschal table of 532 years, containing a 532-year Paschal cycle based on a Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, has survived. Its Metonic 19-year lunar cycle was adopted by bishop Cyril of Alexandria, who used it in his own (Greek language and Alexandrian calendar) Paschal table of 114 years. Shortly before Cyril&#x27;s death (AD444), a beginning was made with a Latin language and Julian calendar Paschal table probably intended for use in the Latin part of Europe; this resulted in a similar Paschal table of 95 years, referred to as ‘the Paschal table attributed to Cyril’, which covered time interval . A century later this Paschal table was continued by Dionysius Exiguus to a Paschal table covering time interval , two centuries hereafter his Paschal table was extended to Bede’s Easter table covering time interval and containing a 532-year Paschal cycle. We conclude that it is precisely Annianus’ variant of the Metonic 19-year lunar cycle (invented by Anatolius) which from the sixth to the sixteenth century has been the core of the computus paschalis in the Latin Christian world, because it was not earlier than in the year 1582 that the Julian calendar was replaced with the Gregorian calendar.

As far as Victorius of Aquitaine is concerned, Jan Zuidhoek, pretending to mention explicitly all relevant Metonic 19-year lunar cycles, has missed an opportunity to mention Victorius’ one. However, Alden Mosshammer has mentioned it explicitly. In principle, each date of the 532-year Paschal cycle of Victorius’ Paschal table can be calculated by applying the old Roman rule “Paschal Sunday is the first Sunday after the first day after the Paschal full moon” to the corresponding date of the Paschal full moon of its lunar cycle (if desired with the help of the number indicating the weekday of ).

<text>Montague grammar is an approach to natural language semantics, named after American logician Richard Montague. The Montague grammar is based on mathematical logic, especially higher-order predicate logic and lambda calculus, and makes use of the notions of intensional logic, via Kripke models. Montague pioneered this approach in the 1960s and early 1970s.

==Overview==
Montague&#x27;s thesis was that natural languages (like English) and formal languages (like programming languages) can be treated in the same way:

There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory. On this point I differ from a number of philosophers, but agree, I believe, with Chomsky and his associates. (&quot;Universal Grammar&quot; 1970)
Montague published what soon became known as Montague grammar in three papers:
* 1970: &quot;Universal grammar&quot; (= UG)
* 1970: &quot;English as a Formal Language&quot; (= EFL)
* 1973: &quot;The Proper Treatment of Quantification in Ordinary English&quot; (= PTQ)

==Illustration==

Montague grammar can represent the meanings of quite complex sentences
compactly. Below is a grammar presented in Eijck and Unger&#x27;s textbook.

The types of the syntactic categories in the grammar are as follows, with &quot;t&quot;
denoting a term (a reference to an entity) and &quot;f&quot; denoting a formula.

The meaning of a sentence obtained by the rule formula_1 is obtained by
applying the function for NP to the function for VP.

The types of VP and NP might appear unintuitive because of the question as to the meaning of a noun phrase that is not simply a term. This is because meanings of many noun phrases, such as &quot;the man who whistles&quot;, are not just terms in predicate logic, but also include a predicate for the activity, like &quot;whistles&quot;, which cannot be represented in the term (consisting of constant and function symbols but not of predicates). So we need some term, for example &quot;x&quot;, and a formula &quot;whistles(x)&quot; to refer to the man who whistles. The meaning of verb phrases VP can be expressed with that term, for example stating that a particular &quot;x&quot; satisfies sleeps(x) formula_2 snores(x) (expressed as a function from &quot;x&quot; to that formula). Now the function associated with NP takes that kind of function and combines it with the formulas needed to express the meaning of the noun phrase. This particular way of stating NP and VP is not the only possible one.

Key is the meaning of an expression is obtained as a function of its components, either by function application (indicated by boldface parentheses enclosing function and argument) or by constructing a new function from the functions associated with the component. This compositionality makes it possible to assign meanings reliably to arbitrarily complex sentence structures, with auxiliary clauses and many other complications.

The meanings of other categories of expressions are either similarly function applications, or higher-order functions. The following are the rules of the grammar, with
the first column indicating a non-terminal symbol, the second column one possible
way of producing that non-terminal from other non-terminals and terminals,
and the third column indicating the corresponding meaning.

Here are example expressions and their associated meaning, according to the above grammar, showing that the meaning of a given sentence is formed from its constituent
expressions, either by forming a new higher-order function, or by applying
a higher-order function for one expression to the meaning of another.

The following are other examples of sentences translated into the predicate logic by the grammar.

==In popular culture==
In David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, the protagonist Hal Incandenza has written an essay entitled &quot;Montague Grammar and the Semantics of Physical Modality&quot;. Montague grammar is also referenced explicitly and implicitly several times throughout the book.

<text>Theodore S. Celeste (born September 27, 1945) is an American businessman and former politician. He is a member of the Democratic Party. After serving in the Peace Corps, Celeste, the brother of former Ohio governor and U.S. ambassador Dick Celeste, ran for the U.S. Senate in 2000 and lost to the Republican incumbent Mike DeWine. In 2006, Celeste was elected State Representative of Ohio&#x27;s 24th District, and served until 2012.

==Early life, education, and business career==
After graduating from the College of Wooster, Celeste and his wife taught school in Fiji via the Peace Corps. Following that, he served as acting chief of the Bureau of Consumer Services in the Ohio Department of Public Welfare and then in the Ohio Department of Finance.

A former real estate developer, Celeste helped chair Governor and brother Dick Celeste&#x27;s gubernatorial campaigns Ted Strickland&#x27;s 2006 gubernatorial campaign. Celeste also served for nine years on The Ohio State University Board of Trustees.

==2000 U.S. Senate election==

He ran for the U.S. Senate for the seat held by Republican U.S. Senator Mike DeWine. In the Democratic primary, he defeated perennial candidate Marvin McMickle, former State Representative Richard Cordray, and activist Daniel Radakovich 44%-24%-24%-8%. He won all but five counties: Pike, Pickaway, Franklin, Madison, and Cuyahoga counties. Cordray defeated Celeste in his home county (Franklin) 49%-34%. In the general election, DeWine won re-election to a second term by defeating Celeste by a landslide 60%-36%, while Republican Governor George W. Bush defeated Democratic Vice President Al Gore in Ohio 50%-47%.

==Ohio House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2006, incumbent Republican Geoffrey C. Smith was seen as vulnerable, and Celeste entered the Ohio House race to try and unseat him. However, despite his name recognition, Celeste faced a four-way primary in 2006. He ended up winning 67% of the electorate. In the general election of that year, Republicans began to run negatively against Celeste, yet he vowed to stay positive in his campaigning. In the end, Celeste ended up defeating Smith, winning by about 4,300 votes.

Early on in the 2008 cycle, Celeste was in considerations for leadership if the House were to go into Democratic hands. However, he faced strong opposition for caucus leader from Todd Book and Armond Budish. In the 2008 general election Republicans looked to take back the district, and fielded attorney Timothy Rankin to take on Celeste. Celeste won a second term by around 9,000 votes.

Less vulnerable in 2010 but still contentious, Celeste faced Republican Nathan Larger. However, the race proved to be closer than anticipated, and Celeste won by less than 3,000 votes.

===Tenure===
In the end, Budish defeated Celeste, Book, and Matt Szollosi to take the Speaker position.

Celeste was vocal about concerns regarding a bill to replace overtime with comp time. &quot;I think we&#x27;ve gone in the wrong direction,&quot; he said before voting against the bill.

Along with Nickie Antonio, Celeste has introduced legislation to end the death penalty in Ohio. Celeste has cited the financial burden that death row brings to the taxpayers, and that there should be a discussion on the death penalty included in the upcoming budget deliberations. Celeste has pointed to evidence that the penalty has been discriminatory toward minorities.

Celeste has stated that he believes Republicans have embarked upon a &quot;starve the beast&quot; strategy, with their main intent being to hurt the future financial support of the Democratic Party with Senate Bill 5, and the voter-ID bill will make it harder for the traditional base to collect votes. He also stated the influence they will be able to gain through redistricting.

With Andrew Brenner, Celeste has sponsored a bill that aims to support children with dyslexia. His legislation sought to demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of early reading assistance programs for children with dyslexia and to evaluate whether those programs can reduce future special education costs.

===Committee assignments===
He was named Chairman of the House Alternative Energy Committee, and the Higher Education Subcommittee of the House Finance and Appropriations Committee. Currently, he serves on the committees of Health and Aging; Economic and Small Business Development; Education; and State Government and Elections.

==2012 congressional election==

In November 2011, he decided to retire from the Ohio House to run for the newly redrawn Ohio&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, based in Columbus. Celeste placed last out of four contenders.

<text>The Stepford Wives is a 2004 American science fiction black comedy film directed by Frank Oz from a screenplay by Paul Rudnick and starring Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken, Faith Hill, and Glenn Close. The second feature-length adaptation of Ira Levin&#x27;s 1972 novel of the same name following the 1975 film of the same name, it received generally negative reviews from critics and was a box office failure, grossing $103 million worldwide on a $90–100 million budget.

==Plot==
Successful reality television executive producer Joanna Eberhart&#x27;s career suddenly ends after a disillusioned reality show participant named Hank tries to kill her. Upon the loss of her job, Joanna suffers a mental breakdown and she, her husband Walter Kresby, and their two children move from Manhattan to Stepford, a quiet Fairfield County, Connecticut suburb. After the family&#x27;s arrival, Joanna befriends writer and recovering alcoholic Roberta &quot;Bobbie&quot; Markowitz and Roger Bannister, a gay architect who has moved to town with his long-time partner Jerry, a corporate lawyer.

After the trio witness Sarah Sunderson violently dance and then collapse, Joanna argues with Walter about the incident until Walter bluntly informs her that her children barely know her, their marriage is falling apart, and her domineering nature makes people want to kill her. As he tries to walk out of their marriage, Joanna apologizes and agrees to appease him by trying to fit in with the other wives. The next day, Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger go to Sarah&#x27;s home to check up on her, where upon entering, they hear her upstairs, ecstatically screaming during sex with her husband Herb. As they scramble to sneak out, they find a remote control labeled &quot;SARAH&quot;, and when they unwittingly fiddle with it, Sarah&#x27;s breasts enlarge and she robotically walks backward.

One evening, Walter and Bobbie&#x27;s husband Dave go to the Men&#x27;s Association with Roger and Jerry, but Joanna and Bobbie hire a babysitter and sneak inside to spy on them and the other husbands. They discover a hall filled with family portraits, but then Roger sees them and assures them that all is well. The next day, the pair discover Roger&#x27;s flamboyant clothing, Playbill program from &quot;Hairspray&quot;, and memorabilia of Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen have all been discarded. Jerry tells them to meet him in the town hall and they see Roger, apparently running for Connecticut State Senate with a bland look and conformist personality, all at Jerry&#x27;s direction. Joanna wants to leave and Walter agrees, saying they will go the next day. Going into Walter&#x27;s study, she discovers that all the Stepford wives were once working women in high-power positions, just like herself.

The next day, Joanna visits Bobbie, noticing that her formerly messy house is spotless. Now blending in with the other Stepford wives, Bobbie says she is a whole new person and the most important thing is her cookbook. While offering to help Joanna change, Bobbie does not notice her own hand on fire when she obliviously rests it on a stove burner. Joanna flees Bobbie&#x27;s house to look for Walter at the Men&#x27;s Association, where all the neighborhood&#x27;s husbands imposingly surround her. Walter laments to Joanna that he always felt emasculated by her, and the Men&#x27;s Association leader Mike Wellington explains that they insert nanochips into their wives&#x27; brains to make them into poised, submissive Stepford Wives. Joanna asks if the nano-chipped wives really mean it when they tell their husbands that they love them, to which Mike only replies &quot;Enjoy&quot; and ushers a reluctant Walter and Joanna into the transformation chamber. Next, all of the Stepford spouses, including Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger, are dazedly shopping at the grocery store dressed in classy Sunday attire.

With Joanna and Walter as special guests, there is a formal ball. During the festivities, Joanna distracts Mike and entices him into the garden, while Walter slips away to the transformation room where he destroys the software that programs the women. The wives all start confronting their husbands, and Walter and Joanna reveal that they never went through with the microchip implant. When Mike nearly assaults Walter, Joanna decapitates Mike with a candlestick, exposing him as a fully animatronic robot. Mike&#x27;s wife Claire explains that she created Stepford because she, too, was a bitter career-minded woman, and when she discovered Mike&#x27;s affair with her research assistant, she murdered them in a jealous rage, then used her skills as a brain surgeon to develop the Stepford Wives program to improve marriages. Claire then electrocutes herself to death by kissing Mike&#x27;s severed robotic head.

Six months later, in an interview with Larry King, Joanna (who has won six Emmys for producing the hard-hitting documentary &quot;Stepford: The Secret of the Suburbs&quot;), Roger (who has won his State Senate seat as an Independent) and Bobbie (who has written and published her first book of poetry &quot;Wait Until He&#x27;s Asleep, Then Cut It Off&quot;) explain that the Stepford husbands are under house arrest for their crimes and being &quot;retrained&quot;. The closing scene shows the husbands haplessly shopping for groceries, under the strict oversight of their wives.

==Production==
John Cusack and his sister Joan were originally cast as Walter and Bobbie, respectively, but both had to drop out of the film only weeks before filming started to be with their father Dick, who was dying. Joan had previously appeared in two other films written by Rudnick, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; and &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; (the latter also directed by Frank Oz, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award).

Reportedly, there were problems on-set between Oz and stars Nicole Kidman, Bette Midler, Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Roger Bart. In a 2003 interview, Oz stated, &quot;Tension on the set? Absolutely! In every movie I do, there&#x27;s tension. That&#x27;s the whole point. And working people hard, that&#x27;s exactly what they expect me to do [...] Bette has been under a lot of stress lately [...] She made the mistake of bringing her stress on the set.&quot;

The film was originally conceived as a darkly satirical piece with an ending closer to the finale of the original but negative results from test screenings caused Paramount to commission numerous rounds of reshoots which significantly altered the tone of the film and gave it a new ending.

In a 2005 interview Matthew Broderick stated, &quot;Making that film wasn&#x27;t enjoyable. It was nobody&#x27;s fault but my part was not terribly interesting [...] It was not a thrilling film. I would hate it if it were my last.&quot;

In a 2007 interview with &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot;, Oz&#x27;s take on the film was &quot;I had too much money and I was too responsible and concerned for Paramount. I was too concerned for the producers. And I didn&#x27;t follow my instincts.&quot;

The majority of the film was shot in Darien, New Canaan and Norwalk, Connecticut.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; holds an approval rating of 26% based on 176 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;In exchanging the chilling satire of the original into mindless camp, this remake has itself become Stepford-ized.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Pete Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that the on-set complications of the film &quot;can&#x27;t compare to the mess onscreen.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;The remake is, in fact, marooned in a swamp of camp, inconsequentiality.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;the movie never lives up to its satiric potential, collapsing at the end into incoherence and wishy-washy, have-it-all sentimentality.&quot;

Some critics were more receptive to the film. Roger Ebert called Paul Rudnick&#x27;s screenplay &quot;rich with zingers&quot; and gave the film three stars.

The film&#x27;s teaser won several Golden Trailer Awards in the categories of &quot;Summer 2004 Blockbuster&quot; and &quot;Most Original&quot;, as well as &quot;Best of Show&quot;.

===Box office===
The U.S. opening weekend grossed a solid $21.4 million, but sales declined sharply afterward. That weekend represented over a third of the final domestic gross of $59.5 million. The film also grossed $42.9 million internationally for a worldwide total gross of $103.4 million.

<doc id="709323" wikidata="Q336163" url="?curid=709323" title="Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield">
<text>Susan Adele Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield, (born 1 October 1950) is an English scientist, writer, broadcaster and member of the House of Lords (since 2001). Her research has focused on the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She is also interested in the neuroscience of consciousness and the impact of technology on the brain.

Greenfield is a senior research fellow at Lincoln College, Oxford; she was a professor of Synaptic Pharmacology.

Greenfield was chancellor of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh between 2005 and 2013. From 1998 to 2010, she was director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain. In September 2013, she co-founded the biotech company Neuro-bio Ltd, where she is chief executive officer.
==Early life==

Greenfield&#x27;s mother, Doris (née Thorp), was a dancer and a Christian, and her father, Reginald Myer Greenfield, was an electrician who was the son of a Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrant from Austria; her grandmothers never spoke to each other and she said of them, &quot;the prejudice was equally vociferous on both sides&quot;.

==Education==

She attended the Godolphin and Latymer School, where she took A levels in Latin, Greek and ancient history, and maths. The first member of her immediate family to go to university, she was initially admitted to St Hilda&#x27;s College to read Philosophy and Psychology, but changed course and graduated with a first-class degree in experimental psychology. As a Senior Scholar at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, she completed her DPhil degree in 1977 under the supervision of Anthony David Smith on the &quot;Origins of acetylcholinesterase in cerebrospinal fluid&quot;.

She then held a junior research fellowship at Green College, Oxford between 1981 and 1984.

==Career==
Greenfield&#x27;s research is focused on brain physiology, particularly on the brain mechanisms of Parkinson&#x27;s and Alzheimer&#x27;s diseases. She is also known for her role in popularising science. Greenfield has written several books about the brain, regularly gives public lectures, and appears on radio and television.

Since 1976, Greenfield has published approximately 200 papers in peer-reviewed journals, including studies on brain mechanisms involved in addiction and reward, relating to dopamine systems and other neurochemicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05646.x|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She investigated the brain mechanisms underlying attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as the impact of environmental enrichment.

In 1994, she was the first woman to give the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures, then sponsored by the BBC. Her lectures were titled &quot;Journey to the centre of the brain&quot;. She was appointed Director of the Royal Institution in 1998. The post was abolished in 2010. The Royal Institution had found itself in a financial crisis following a £22m development programme led by Greenfield and the board. The project ended £3 million in debt. Greenfield subsequently announced that she would be taking her employers to an employment tribunal and her claim would include discrimination. The case was settled out of court.

Greenfield&#x27;s two main positions at Oxford were Tutorial Fellow in Medicine at Lincoln College Oxford, and Professor of Synaptic Pharmacology. Between 1995 and 1999, she gave public lectures as Gresham Professor of Physic in London. Greenfield was Adelaide&#x27;s Thinker in Residence for 2004 and 2005.

As a result of her recommendations, South Australian Premier Mike Rann made a major funding commitment, backed by the state and federal governments and the private sector, to establish the Royal Institution of Australia and the Australian Science Media Centre in Adelaide.

She has explored the relevance of neuroscience knowledge to education&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1177/1073858409356111|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and has used the phrase &quot;mind change&quot;, an umbrella term comparable to &quot;climate change&quot;, encompassing diverse issues involved in the impact of the 21st-century environment on the brain.

In 2013 she co-founded the biotech company Neuro-Bio Ltd which develops diagnostic tests and therapeutics for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The company has found that the C terminus of acetylcholinesterase can be cleaved and that the resulting peptide can kill neurons; the company has also found that a cyclic peptide analogue could prevent that neuronal death. The company raised around $4 million in 2017.

==Politics==

Greenfield sits in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the House of Lords as a crossbencher, having no formal political affiliation. Records of Greenfield&#x27;s activity in the House of Lords indicate abstention on a range of issues. She has spoken on a variety of topics, including education, drugs, and economic empowerment for women.

==Books==

In 2013, Greenfield published a dystopian science-fiction novel, &quot;2121: A Tale from the Next Century&quot;, telling the story of videogame-playing hedonists and their conflict with &quot;Neo-Puritans&quot;.

In 2014, Greenfield published a popular science book called &quot;Mind Change: How Digital Technologies are Leaving their Mark on our Brains,&quot; describing her ideas about the impact of digital technology.

==Impact of digital technology controversy==

Greenfield has expressed concerns that internet usage may modify the brain structures of youngsters.

She has had controversy surrounding her opinions on the relationship between technology use and Autism Spectrum Disorder. She originally linked the increase in Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis to increased screen-time in a 2011 New Scientist article. She defended this claim in 2014, in an interview with Stephen Sackur, on the BBC show HARDTalk, in which she claims to have collated 500 articles &quot;in support of the possible problematic effects&quot; of technology-use.

She noted that Public Health England had related social networking and multiplayer online games to &quot;lower levels of wellbeing&quot;, and believed that evidence pointed to a &quot;dose response&quot; relationship, &quot;where each additional hour of viewing increases the likelihood of experiencing socio-emotional problems&quot;. She believed this raised questions about where to draw the boundaries between beneficial and harmful use of such technology, saying that &quot;it would be surprising if many hours per day of screen activity did not influence this neuroplasticity&quot;.

==Honours==
As of 2016, Greenfield has 32 honorary degrees; has received awards including the Royal Society&#x27;s Michael Faraday Prize. She has been elected to an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and the London Science Museum.

In 2006 she was made an Honorary Fellow of the British Science Association and was the Honorary Australian of the Year.

In January 2000, Greenfield received a CBE for her contribution to the public understanding of science. Later that year, she was named Woman of the Year by &quot;The Observer&quot;. In 2001, she became a Life Peer under the House of Lords Appointments Commission system, as Baroness Greenfield, of Ot Moor, Oxfordshire. Like the other people&#x27;s peers she was self-nominated.

In 2003, she was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour by the French Government. In 2010 she was awarded the Australian Society for Medical Research Medal. She received the British Inspiration award for Science and Technology in 2010.

==Patronage==
She is a patron of Alzheimer&#x27;s Research UK and of Dignity in Dying. She is a founder and trustee of the charity Science for Humanity, a network of scientists, researchers and technologists that collaborates with not-for-profit organisations to create practical solutions to the everyday problems of developing communities.

==Personal life==
Greenfield was married to the University of Oxford professor Peter Atkins from 1991 until their divorce in 2005.

<doc id="709333" wikidata="Q1190079" url="?curid=709333" title="Riddick (character)">
<text>Richard B. Riddick, commonly known as Riddick, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot; series. This series includes the animated short film &quot;Dark Fury&quot; and the video games &quot;Escape from Butcher Bay&quot; and &quot;Assault on Dark Athena&quot;. Actor Vin Diesel has portrayed Riddick in all film and video game adaptations.

Within the series, Riddick is depicted as having a wide range of skills, including exceptional mobility, stealth, combat abilities, survival in harsh conditions, prison escape, and piloting. Despite his criminal background, he occasionally performs moral or heroic actions, often against his own survivalist instincts.

Originally shown as a human in &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, Riddick&#x27;s race is later revealed to be Furyan in subsequent sequels. The Furyans are a warrior race nearly exterminated by a military campaign that left their home planet, Furya, desolate. Riddick is one of the last surviving members of this race. His eyes, a defining feature, allow him to see clearly in the dark, a trait associated with a specific caste of Furyans known as Alpha-Furyans. In &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, he implies that his eyes were surgically altered, but this is later attributed to his Furyan heritage. To protect his eyes from bright light, he wears tinted welding goggles.

Riddick&#x27;s past includes roles as a mercenary and a member of a security force, eventually becoming a soldier. This background contributes to his complex character, blending elements of an antihero with occasional heroic actions.

==Biography ==
===Early life===
Riddick was born on the planet Furya. Before his birth, a Necromonger officer named Zhylaw who would later become the Lord Marshal, consulted an Elemental seer. The seer foretold that a Furyan male would be born who would ultimately lead to Zhylaw&#x27;s downfall. In response, Zhylaw launched an attack on Furya, attempting to massacre all male infants, even personally strangling newborns with their umbilical cords. Riddick was among those targeted but managed to survive the ordeal.

In his later life, Riddick repressed memories of the massacre on Furya. He believed that his mother had attempted to strangle him at birth and abandoned him in a trash bin behind a liquor store. Despite these repressed memories, he periodically received visions and messages from Shirah, a surviving Furyan.

===&quot;Pitch Black&quot;===

In the premiere installment of the Chronicles of Riddick franchise, Riddick is introduced as a notorious convict being transported to a penal institution by a bounty hunter named William J. Johns. Johns, posing as a police officer, travels with a group of settlers aboard the transport ship Hunter Gratzner. His objective is to safely deliver Riddick to a prison colony and claim the substantial bounty on him. 

During the journey, the ship passes through the tail of a comet while on autopilot, causing it to crash land on an unknown planet with three suns. The survivors soon find themselves battling for their lives against a predatory species known as Bio-Raptors. By the end of the film, only three survivors remain: Riddick, a young girl named Jack, and a man named Imam.

===&quot;Dark Fury&quot;===

Shortly after escaping the planet from &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, Riddick, Jack, and Imam are picked up by a mercenary spacecraft. Riddick tries to hide his identity from the mercenaries by impersonating William J. Johns over the intercom. However, the mercenaries quickly identify him through voiceprint recognition.

Captured by the mercenaries, the trio learns that their captors have unusual plans for Riddick. The ship&#x27;s owner, Antonia Chillingsworth, collects notorious criminals, freezing them and displaying them as statues, which she considers art. Although frozen, the criminals remain alive and conscious. Chillingsworth views Riddick as the ultimate &quot;masterpiece&quot; for her collection.

Riddick, Jack, and Imam must fight their way through Chillingsworth&#x27;s army of human and alien creatures to avoid a fate worse than death. After overcoming most of the mercenaries on the ship, the trio takes one of Antonia&#x27;s shuttles and heads for New Mecca. At one point, the navigation system suggests a possible course for Furya, but Riddick ultimately leaves Jack and Imam at New Mecca before departing for the planet UV 6.

===&quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;===

Five years later, Riddick remains in hiding on an Arctic planet known as UV 6, characterized by its harsh ultraviolet light. During this time, Imam learns that his home planet, Helion Prime, is threatened by an impending invasion from the Necromongers, a fanatical religious crusade. Remembering Riddick&#x27;s story about his Furyan origins, Imam reveals Riddick&#x27;s location to the leaders of Helion Prime.

Initially, Riddick is reluctant to become involved in the conflict between the Necromongers and the worlds they seek to conquer. However, after Imam is killed, Riddick embarks on a mission to avenge him. With the assistance of Jack (who has abandoned that name in favor of Kyra while in prison), Riddick ultimately overthrows the Necromonger leader, the Lord Marshal, and assumes his position as the new leader of the Necromongers..

===&quot;Riddick&quot;===

Dissatisfied with his role as Lord Marshal, Riddick sets out to find Furya, but instead, he is abandoned on a desolate planet. Stranded, he discovers that a deadly storm is approaching, which will provide cover for numerous predators. To escape, Riddick uses the communication system from a mercenary outpost to lure two ships to the planet, intending to commandeer one. However, his plan becomes complicated when one of the arriving mercenaries turns out to be the father of William J. Johns, his old adversary.

As the storm nears, Riddick forces the mercenaries to cooperate with him to survive. Despite their initial hostility, Riddick is eventually surrounded by enemies and nearly killed. Unexpectedly, the elder Johns rescues him and allows him to leave the planet. Before departing, Riddick acknowledges that Johns is a better man than his son.

==Powers and abilities==
===Eyeshine===

According to Riddick, while imprisoned in Butcher Bay, he received eye surgery—referred to as a &quot;surgical shine job&quot;—from a doctor who granted him permanent night vision in exchange for &quot;20 menthol KOOLs&quot; cigarettes. This procedure made his eyes highly sensitive to normal light, necessitating the use of welding goggles for protection, although he is occasionally seen without them in normally lit environments.

In the flash movie on the Pitchblack.com website, Riddick undergoes the eye-shine surgery to gain an advantage after encountering humanoids called &quot;shiners,&quot; who also possess enhanced night vision. These &quot;shiners&quot; call Riddick &quot;darkeye&quot; and have had similar surgeries to navigate the dark areas of the Ursa Luna prison, where guards rarely venture. The surgery is depicted as being performed by a bovine veterinarian in a prison facility where Riddick has just arrived and is already planning his escape. Riddick chooses to forgo anesthesia for the painful procedure, which involves cutting the cornea and drilling into the eye to inject a reflective substance behind the retina. The quoted cost is 1000 credits, but having no cash, Riddick offers a pack of KOOL cigarettes as a down payment and takes welding goggles from the facility.

The video game &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, provides additional context. In the game, after helping a character named &quot;Pope Joe&quot; retrieve his &quot;blessed voice box,&quot; Riddick receives stitches for an injury. Pope Joe advises Riddick on how to escape and warns him not to &quot;trust [his] eyes.&quot; At that moment, a ghostly voice informs Riddick that he has &quot;been blind for far too long&quot; and grants him a &quot;gift.&quot; This voice belongs to a character named &quot;Shirah,&quot; who serves as a spiritual guide, helping Riddick awaken his dormant Furyan abilities. This moment marks the acquisition of his eyeshine. 

In the &quot;Chronicles of Riddick&quot; film, Jack/Kyra confronts Riddick, revealing that during her imprisonment, she discovered that no one could perform a &quot;surgical shine job&quot; for any price, accusing Riddick of lying about how he gained his night vision.

Interestingly, a real-life procedure somewhat similar to Riddick&#x27;s fictional eyeshine, involving light amplification, has been patented.

===Wrath of the Furyans===
In addition to aiding Riddick in unlocking his eyeshine, the character Shirah helps him discover his ability to unleash a powerful energy wave. This ability is depicted in the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;. During a pivotal scene, Shirah places her hand on Riddick&#x27;s chest, leaving a glowing blue handprint, and states, &quot;this mark carries the anger of an entire race... but it&#x27;s going to hurt.&quot; Subsequently, either immediately after being struck by Vaako&#x27;s energy handgun or just before the weapon discharges, Riddick releases a large blast of blue energy. This blast emanates from Riddick, seemingly guided by Shirah, and kills the surrounding Necromongers.

This formidable energy wave ability is also referenced off-screen in the video game &quot;Escape from Butcher Bay&quot;.. Shirah&#x27;s interventions highlight Riddick&#x27;s latent Furyan powers, which are pivotal in his battles against the Necromongers and other adversaries.

===Physical abilities===
Riddick is depicted as being in exceptional physical condition and is an extraordinary fighter, both with and without his enhanced vision. Whether due to his Furyan heritage or rigorous training, Riddick exhibits superior strength, speed, agility, toughness, resistance to injury, acute senses, immense stamina, and rapid healing compared to most humans. He can dislocate his limbs briefly with minimal discomfort and has demonstrated remarkable pain tolerance, such as when he cauterized a chest wound using a heated rock after being impaled.

Riddick&#x27;s resilience extends to his ability to withstand toxins. For instance, a mercenary team attempting to sedate him with horse tranquilizers required four darts just to slow him down, and he remained conscious until struck on the head. His high pain threshold and ability to psychologically channel pain into anger, combined with his sharp intelligence, contribute significantly to his ability to escape from almost any situation.

In hand-to-hand combat, Riddick&#x27;s skills incorporate elements of Krav Maga, Hapkido, Eskrima, and Ninjutsu. He effectively uses these skills in various confrontations, such as killing one of the night-creatures in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; with a makeshift shiv and swiftly defeating a top Necromonger warrior in &quot;Chronicles&quot;. Additionally, Riddick managed to hold his own against the Lord Marshal, even inflicting injuries—a feat the Lord Marshal admitted had not occurred in a long time. Although Riddick was not as fast as the Lord Marshal, he managed to hold him off for several minutes.

===Intelligence===
Despite his harsh upbringing and often violent demeanor, Riddick possesses a keen deductive ability. He quickly discerns the fate of the original inhabitants of a mining base and identifies blind spots in dangerous situations, such as facing creatures in &quot;Pitch Black&quot; and deducing the cause of a firefight in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;. 

Renowned for his escape prowess, Riddick has evaded capture numerous times, surviving the Lord Marshal&#x27;s purges and escaping from multiple prisons throughout his life. He demonstrates a remarkable proficiency in evaluating and identifying flaws in weaponry, even minor ones, with impressive speed and precision.

Riddick&#x27;s notable weakness, aside from light sensitivity, is his soft spot for individuals who earn his trust. He is particularly protective of children and those who grow on him, often going out of his way to assist them. However, his assistance is conditional on not impeding his survival or making him vulnerable.

In addition to his analytical skills, Riddick possesses a sharp understanding of human nature, particularly its darker aspects. Having experienced life in maximum-security facilities and as a killer himself, he can often anticipate individuals&#x27; negative tendencies before they act on them. While occasionally surprised by acts of altruism, such as Carolyn Fry&#x27;s sacrifice in &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, Riddick generally accurately predicts interpersonal dynamics and potential betrayals.

Despite his rugged exterior, Riddick appreciates acts of bravery and integrity, as evidenced by his positive reaction to Johns&#x27; father coming to his aid in &quot;Riddick&quot;. Overall, Riddick&#x27;s keen insight and instinctual understanding of human behavior contribute to his survival and success in challenging circumstances.

===Willpower===
One of Riddick&#x27;s defining characteristics is his unwavering willpower. Despite facing seemingly insurmountable odds in situations where survival or escape appears improbable, Riddick consistently exhibits resilience and determination. Confronted with formidable creatures vastly more powerful than himself or any human, he demonstrates the ability to evade, defeat, or even tame them. 

Riddick&#x27;s indomitable will is particularly evident in his numerous successful escapes from seemingly impenetrable prisons, a feat most prisoners would resign themselves to as impossible. Even when mentally probed by the Quasi-Dead of the Necromongers, Riddick not only resists their intrusion but retaliates, causing the Quasi-Dead&#x27;s containers to explode under the strain of attempting to process his resilience. This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy given the Necromongers&#x27; reverence for the power of the Quasi-Dead.

An even more remarkable demonstration of Riddick&#x27;s iron will is his ability to resist the Lord Marshal&#x27;s attempt to steal his soul. Despite the Lord Marshal&#x27;s formidable powers, Riddick remains defiant and refuses to succumb. 

Although Riddick experiences a momentary wavering of his will when Kyra sacrifices herself to save him and help defeat the Lord Marshal, he channels his grief into renewed determination. This instance underscores Riddick&#x27;s ability to transform adversity into strength, exemplifying his unyielding resolve in the face of adversity.

===Weapons===
Riddick is highly proficient with a wide range of weapons, but his preferred choice is undoubtedly a knife. Renowned for his skill with blades, Riddick&#x27;s most iconic weapons are a pair of Ulak blades, prominently featured during his daring escape from Crematoria in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;.

Despite his mastery of knives, Riddick is adept at utilizing any weapon he can acquire. From Necromonger gravity rifles to unconventional items like teacups, Riddick demonstrates versatility in combat. Moreover, he is capable of efficiently dispatching adversaries even without conventional weaponry. &quot;In The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;, he employs a knife taken from Irgun during a confrontation, ultimately using it to defeat both Irgun and the Lord Marshal.

In the third film, Riddick primarily relies on a bone-sword crafted from the remains of a slain creature. This improvised weapon showcases his resourcefulness and adaptability in hostile environments. Overall, Riddick&#x27;s proficiency with weapons, coupled with his strategic ingenuity, makes him a formidable opponent in combat situations.

==Other appearances==
Riddick made his first appearance outside of the film &quot;Pitch Black&quot; in the gaming world as a guest character in &quot;Fallout Tactics&quot;. In this game, he appears in a special encounter titled &quot;Pitch Black&quot; reflecting his movie origin. Like his cinematic counterpart, Riddick is portrayed as a stealth-focused melee fighter with advanced hand-to-hand combat skills and the ability to see in the dark.

Additionally, Riddick has been featured as a playable character in the Xbox game &quot;Deathrow&quot;. As a member of the Convicts team, he possesses the highest levels of strength and aggression among recruitable players. However, he also has one of the lowest teamplay ratings in the game.

A parody version of the Riddick character has been the protagonist in the TimeSplitters video game franchise.

Richard B. Riddick first made his debut in the Shockwave prequel comic &quot;Pitch Black: Slam City,&quot; which was released on the official &quot;Pitch Black&quot; website a month before the movie premiered. Since then, the character has been consistently portrayed by actor Vin Diesel in all subsequent appearances across various media platforms.

In Jim and Ken Wheat&#x27;s original script for &quot;Pitch Black&quot;, the Riddick character was a woman named Taras Krieg.

<text>Joel Z. Hyatt (born Joel Hyatt Zylberberg; May 6, 1950) is an American entrepreneur and former politician. He founded Hyatt Legal Services, in which capacity he became a household name for many years, as he was featured in his firm&#x27;s nationwide television commercials which always ended with the slogan, &quot;I&#x27;m Joel Hyatt and you have my word on it.&quot; Hyatt was a co-founder of Current TV.

==Life and career==
Hyatt graduated from Dartmouth College and Yale Law School. He briefly practiced law as an associate at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.

Hyatt co-founded Hyatt Legal Services in 1977 as a low-cost legal service, making legal services available to millions of hitherto disenfranchised middle- and lower-class Americans. He later founded Hyatt Legal Plans, which became the country&#x27;s largest provider of employer-sponsored group legal services, pioneering the concept of Legal Services as a fringe benefit (provided in the same manner as, for example, dental insurance). Hyatt Legal Plans was acquired by MetLife in 1997.

Hyatt was a founding member of the U.S. Senate Democratic Leadership Circle and was a member of that group from 1981 to 1986. He was the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s assistant treasurer from 1981 to 1983.

Hyatt is the son-in-law of Howard Metzenbaum, former United States Senator for Ohio. Hyatt was Metzenbaum&#x27;s campaign manager for his first two successful bids for the Senate. In the 1994 election, when Metzenbaum decided to retire, Hyatt ran to replace him. Hyatt won the Democratic nomination, but lost to then Lieutenant Governor of Ohio Michael DeWine in the general election, in a campaign year in which Republicans swept all twelve of the Senate vacancies and unseated many incumbents.

In 1990, Hyatt Legal Services paid a $157,000 settlement for having illegally fired an attorney in their Philadelphia offices, Clarence B. Cain, in reference to his AIDS diagnosis. The case was an inspiration for the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, alongside the more renowned Geoffrey Bowers case three-years prior. Hyatt is known to have expressed his disappointment in his own firm&#x27;s handling of the case, and of its treatment of Mr. Cain.

Hyatt was appointed to the California Public Utilities Commission in June 1999, by Governor Gray Davis. He served six months of a six-year term, resigning in December 1999.

Hyatt served as National Finance Chair for the Democratic party in 2000, and is a business partner of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore In 2004, Hyatt and Gore purchased Newsworld International, a cable news channel, programmed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which aired news programming from around the world. On August 1, 2005, Gore and Hyatt relaunched the network as Current TV, a young adult-programmed news and information service which pioneered the concept of user generated content on cable TV. Hyatt and Gore later sold the channel to Al Jazeera Media Network on January 2, 2013 for a reported $500 million. In August 2014, Hyatt and Gore sued Al Jazeera for fraud and breach of contract in connection with a residual payment of $65 million that remained unpaid. The allegations were denied by Al Jazeera as &quot;blatantly false&quot; and &quot;potentially misleading.&quot;

Hyatt taught entrepreneurship at Stanford University Graduate School of Business from 1998 to 2003 and at Stanford Law school. He is a member of the board of trustees of Morehouse College and of The Brookings Institution. Hyatt was elected to the board of directors of Hewlett-Packard Company in May 2007, and of The RAND Corporation in March 2015. Hyatt is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He also serves on the board of Stanford Hospital.

Hyatt was an investor in and chairman of VideoSurf, a computer vision search engine that was acquired by Microsoft in 2011.

Globality Inc, based in Menlo Park, California, is Joel Hyatt&#x27;s current business venture. The company was co-founded by Joel Hyatt and Lior Delgo in March 2015. At the time of its launch, Globality had invited 350 advertising companies to use its services. In 2019, SoftBank invested $100m.

<doc id="709339" wikidata="Q915531" url="?curid=709339" title="Holden Camira">
<text>The Holden Camirais a mid-size car that was produced by Holden between 1982 and 1989. It was Holden&#x27;s version of GM&#x27;s J-body family of cars—GM&#x27;s third &quot;global&quot; car platform, and was heavily based on the European J-body car - the Opel Ascona C. The name &quot;Camira&quot; comes from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;wind.&quot;

After a good initial sales run, Camira sales dropped significantly and the model was discontinued in 1989. The Holden Apollo, a rebadged Toyota Camry, was introduced as the Australian market replacement, with New Zealand instead offering the European-sourced Opel Vectra. In all 151,807 Camiras were built (85,725 JBs; 36,953 JDs; and 29,129 JEs).

== JB (1982–1984) ==

The original Camira, the JB series, was introduced in August 1982 with a major trans-Tasman marketing campaign. The Camira replaced the Sunbird and Torana, although an interim four-cylinder version of the Commodore bridged the two-year production gap.

A station wagon version was introduced in March 1983 and its bodywork was exported to Vauxhall in the United Kingdom for the Cavalier estate. Some Camiras were also exported to right-hand drive markets in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and Singapore. The wagon variant was specifically a Holden design (unrelated to that of the North American J-car wagons), which Holden insisted should be part of the overall &quot;J-car&quot; program. A five-door hatchback, based on the Opel Ascona/Vauxhall Cavalier &quot;J-car&quot; was proposed for the Camira, but never made it to the production stage due to Holden&#x27;s financial losses at that time.

There was only one engine, the carbureted, naturally aspirated, transversely mounted 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine delivering . The transaxle offering was a four-speed manual on the SL and SL/X, with a five-speed unit specified to SJ and SL/E variants. A three-speed automatic was optional on all models. Power steering was optional from early 1984

The Camira was &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1982. While superior to most other cars of the day in terms of ride and handling, the 1.6-litre Family II (&quot;16LF&quot;) engine, marketed as &quot;Camtech&quot;, was regarded as &quot;underpowered&quot; by much of the motoring media. While partly true, the powerplant produced similar power levels to many of its rivals, although the actual power delivery differed. Unlike traditional Australian engines that had reserves of low down torque, the Camira required a very different driving style that involved revving the engine.

Early models of the Camira suffered from a litany of quality control problems, which included smoking engines, insufficient drainage holes in the doors, poor paint quality and lack of adequate fan cooling, resulting in overheating in JB Camiras fitted with air conditioning. This tarnished the Camira&#x27;s reputation and led to its withdrawal from the New Zealand market, where a rebadged version of the Isuzu Aska, known as the JJ Camira, was sold instead.

There are several models within the JB range that are seen as &quot;more desirable&quot; and were produced in very limited numbers. These are the Formula and the SJ; both available in sedans only.

There were also some modified by the Country Dealer Team Performance Vehicle company based in Victoria. These JBs were available in three versions. All had full fibreglass body kits and mag wheels (S1). The S2 had a full range of options. The 1.6 engines were modified with extractors, Weber carbie and the S3 was fitted with a turbo charger. They also have very distinctive decals. There was very limited Camira produced. CDT versions are seen as the rarest and most desirable.

=== Specification levels ===
* SL: entry-level variant, with no air conditioning or power steering, though it is possible to find some with dealer-fitted air conditioning.
* SJ : sporty version based on SL with a five-speed manual transmission. Other changes constrained to cosmetic upgrades. Available in three colours - Electron Blue, Super Maranello Red and Quasar Orange.
* SL/X: received several additional extras over SL including cloth trim, extra chrome, and other cosmetic upgrades.
* SL/E: top-of-the-line model with richer trim, full instrumentation, and alloy wheels as standard. These alloy wheels were styled similarly to those of the VH Commodore SL/E wheels (but using a four spoke/four stud design rather than the Commodore&#x27;s five). Despite being available in all other &quot;J-car&quot; models, power windows were not available in the Australian Camira models until the JE version. However air conditioning and cruise control were optional, as was a trip computer.
== JD (1984–1987) ==

The second series JD Camira, released in November 1984 received a facelift, with a more aerodynamic front-end and the absence of a conventional front grille. The differences were not only cosmetic, the engine was upgraded from 1.6 to a multi-point fuel injected 1.8-litre on the SL/X and SL/E models (the 1.6-litre remained for the SL). These changes combined allowed the engine to deliver at 6200 rpm. The new 1.8-litre engine was available with a close-ratio, five-speed manual transmission, as opposed to the regular four-speed unit.

In mid-1986 new emissions regulations required that all cars manufactured in Australia run on unleaded petrol. Firstly, Holden dropped the base 1.6-litre engine. For the 1.8-litre, Holden was forced to engineer another reworking of the engine (all variants prior to this ran on leaded petrol), during which time Holden was operating at a loss. The result was that Holden dropped the multi-point injection for the 1.8-litre and reverted to single-point, akin to a carburettor, and altered the tuning of the engine to suit. A power-robbing catalytic converter was fitted, and power output was reduced by to .

This engine was also used in Holden&#x27;s locally manufactured compact car, the LD Astra (1987–1989), a badge engineered Nissan Pulsar (N13; 1987–1991), as well as the Pulsar itself. This was the result of a model sharing alliance between Holden and Nissan at the time, where the Nissan body was used in conjunction with GM powertrains. Running on unleaded petrol, this engine had an output of . The Pulsar&#x27;s 1.8-litre engine contained the same basic internals as the JD Camira&#x27;s 1.8-litre engine, with the main exception being the block casting and smaller ports/valves on the head, and smaller intake manifold. Both the Camira and Astra/Pulsar engines were powered by a Delco Electronics engine control unit. This caused problems of its own, as with age, the fine tolerance of the circuitry and componentry have a tendency to fail unexpectedly, and on failing, the engine will cease to operate, or operate with a crippling loss of power due to incorrect tuning and fuel delivery. The external engine mounts are better placed on the Pulsar, and hence result in longer engine mount life.

=== Specification levels ===
* SL, SL/X, and SL/E: as for JB.
* Executive: introduced in 1986 as an option pack for the SL/X. The Executive was first seen on the VK Commodore in 1984.
* Formula: first seen on the JD model, the Formula pack was optional to any model which had special pin striping and side skirts, this pack sold in limited numbers.
== JJ (New Zealand; 1984–1987) ==
In New Zealand the second generation Camira was marketed as the Camira JJ. This consisted of two entirely different J-cars: the sedan version was a rebadged version of the Isuzu Aska from Japan. This decision was made by General Motors New Zealand as sales figures of the Camira JB were poor for this market, however the wagon version which was built and sold in Australia was retained and assembled locally.

== JE (1987–1989) ==

Released in April 1987, the JE was the final series of Camira. By this time, many of the Camira&#x27;s early quality problems had been overcome, and Holden now fitted the multi-point fuel-injected 2.0-litre engine to replace the 1.8-litre unit. The 2.0-litre unit delivered at 5200 rpm and of torque at 3200 rpm. The automatic transaxle in the JE, the Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C, sported a lockup torque converter. Styling changes were minor from the JD with the addition of a thin grille up front, revised bonnet, larger 14-inch wheels and new wheel trims.

After Camira production wound up in August 1989, Holden replaced the Camira with the Apollo, a rebadged Toyota Camry, a result of the Button car plan introduced by the Australian Government, which encouraged a reduction in the number of Australian car-makers and models. General Motors New Zealand was not affected by this scheme and instead replaced the Camira with the European-sourced Opel Vectra, which after 1994 was rebadged as the Holden Vectra. Holden continued to produce the &quot;Family II&quot; engine for export well after the Camira was discontinued. Over three million variants were produced, in 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre configurations, with the 1.8- and 2.0-litre variants being fuel injected.
=== Specification levels ===
* SL, SLX, Executive, SLE: as for JB and JD series, except the SLX and SLE nameplates no longer featured the &quot;/&quot; symbol, as in SL/X.
* Vacationer: was a special edition, based on the Executive, painted light blue metallic (an HT Monaro colour) (Also sold in white) with red and white decals, SLX trim, and SLE roof racks (wagons).
* SLi 2000: was unique to the JE, being a &quot;sports&quot; package based on the SLX. Major differences were the addition of side skirts, a small spoiler and distinctive orange and silver pin striping. In somewhat of a marketing ploy, the SLi was only available in red (with the exception of one white 1988 SLi 2000 purchased from new at Wadsco Motor World in Blenheim, NZ) in the sedan body shell with a five-speed manual transaxle, and with a grey interior from the SLX. Despite its sports-oriented nature, the SLi 2000 was powered by the same &quot;Family II&quot; engine fitted to all other JEs, hence providing no extra performance.
* Formula: was, like the SLi 2000, and could be optioned across the entire sedan range. Skirting and pin striping were also options. Buyers did have the freedom to choose the colour, however all versions had manual transmission and &quot;Formula&quot; headrest inserts.

The Vacationer, SLi 2000 and the Formula were sold in limited numbers and are subsequently rare today, as were cars built with power windows, central locking and automatic boot lid releases.

== Common problems ==
All Camira models suffered from some common problems, which is one of the reasons why the car did not garner significant sales figures.
* Rust often became evident underneath the rear windscreen in almost all sedan models. On wagon models, rust usually occurred in the bottom of the rear door due to inadequate water drainage.
* Models equipped with a manual transmission had a firewall cracking problem, because the clutch mount tore the firewall mounting structure. This was easily rectified or prevented early on, but advanced stages of cracking were difficult to repair due to the awkward location and the need to weld.
* On models fitted with an automatic transmission, the lockup torque converter switch malfunctioned, keeping the torque converter locked in third gear when slowing down and stalling the engine when the car came to standstill. This was due to the poor durability of the plastic switch.
* The engine control unit was notorious for problems. Cracks in the printed circuit board often caused the engine to stall at speed if the board bent, for instance through heat expansion.
* Engine mount breakages were known to occur, especially when the car was driven roughly. This problem was particularly evident in the later fuel injected engines, because the increased engine power correspondingly increased the stress on the Camira&#x27;s rubber engine mounts.
* The water manifold at the rear of the engine was made of hard polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and splits could occur after many heating and cooling cycles, resulting in a loss of engine coolant.
* The cylinder head was prone to warping, especially when the car was driven frequently. This problem was more pronounced in the later fuel injected models, due to increased engine temperatures and greater stress on that component.
* The JB and early JD which were carburettor equipped, suffered from premature failure of the &quot;sandwich mount&quot; located between the carburettor and intake manifold.
* The instrument panel gauges and their fascias would crack and buckle when exposed to continual sunlight and hot days, more than most makes and models.
* The optional alloy wheels on higher-spec models had very sharp internal surfaces, precluding the possibility of fitting inner tubes to rectify any air leaks/punctures.
* Models with power steering had issues with power steering pumps being beneath the engine which were easily damaged driving over speed bumps.

== Safety ==
The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that 1982–1989 Holden Camiras provide a &quot;significantly worse than average&quot; level of safety in the event of an accident, in a comparison to other &quot;medium cars&quot;. The safety rating was not calculated solely on the basis of the protection of the vehicle&#x27;s occupants, but also included protection for &quot;cyclists, pedestrians and drivers of other vehicles&quot; to give a &quot;better guide to the total community impact of vehicle safety.&quot;

<doc id="709340" wikidata="Q232831" url="?curid=709340" title="Suzanne Lenglen">
<text>Suzanne Rachel Flore Lenglen (; 24 May 1899 – 4 July 1938) was a French tennis player. She was the inaugural world No. 1 from 1921 to 1926, winning eight Grand Slam titles in singles and twenty-one in total. She was also a four-time World Hard Court Champion in singles, and ten times in total. Lenglen won six Wimbledon singles titles, including five in a row from 1919 to 1923, and was the champion in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at the first two open French Championships in 1925 and 1926. In doubles, she was undefeated with her usual partner, Elizabeth Ryan, highlighted by another six titles at Wimbledon. Lenglen was the first leading amateur to turn professional. She ranked as the greatest women&#x27;s tennis player from the amateur era in the &quot;100 Greatest of All Time&quot; series on the Tennis Channel in 2012.

Coached by her father Charles throughout her career, Lenglen began playing tennis at age 11, becoming the youngest major champion in history with her 1914 World Hard Court Championship title at age 15. This success, along with her balletic playing style and brash personality, helped make Lenglen a national heroine in a country coping with the aftermath of World War I. After the war had delayed her career four years, Lenglen was largely unchallenged. She won her Wimbledon debut in 1919 in the second-longest final in history, the only one of her major singles finals she did not win by a lopsided scoreline. Her only post-war loss came in a retirement against Molla Mallory, her only amateur match in the United States. Afterwards, she began a 179-match win streak, during which she defeated Helen Wills in the high-profile Match of the Century in 1926. Following a misunderstanding at Wimbledon later that year, Lenglen abruptly retired from amateur tennis, signing to headline a professional tour in the United States beginning that same year.

Referred to by the French press as &quot;La Divine&quot; (The Goddess), Lenglen revolutionised the sport by integrating the aggressive style of men&#x27;s tennis into the women&#x27;s game and breaking the convention of women competing in clothing unsuitable for tennis. She incorporated fashion into her matches, highlighted by her signature bandeau headwear. Lenglen is recognised as the first female athlete to become a global sport celebrity and her popularity led Wimbledon to move to its larger modern-day venue. Her professional tours laid the foundation for the series of men&#x27;s professional tours that continued until the Open Era, and led to the first major men&#x27;s professional tournament the following year. Lenglen was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1978, and the second show court at the site of the French Open is named in her honour.

==Early life and background==
Suzanne Rachel Flore Lenglen was born in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 24 May 1899 to Charles and Anaïs Lenglen (née Dhainault). She had a younger brother who did not live past the age of three. Lenglen&#x27;s father was a pharmacist who became wealthy by inheriting a horse-drawn omnibus company from his father. Several years after Suzanne was born, her father sold the omnibus business, after which he relocated the family to Marest-sur-Matz near Compiègne in northern France in 1904. They spent their winters in Nice on the French Riviera in a villa across the street from the Nice Lawn Tennis Club. By the time Lenglen was eight, she excelled at a variety of sports, including swimming and cycling. In particular, she enjoyed diabolo, a game involving balancing a spinning top on a string with two attached sticks. During the winter, Lenglen performed diabolo routines in front of large crowds on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. Her father credited her confidence to play tennis in large stadiums to her experience as a diabolo performer.
Lenglen&#x27;s father attended tennis tournaments on the Riviera circuit, where the world&#x27;s best players competed in the first half of the year. Having played the sport recreationally, he bought Lenglen a racket from a toy shop in June 1910 shortly after she had turned 11 years old, and set up a makeshift court on the lawn of their house. She quickly showed enough skill to convince her father to get her a proper racket from a tennis manufacturer within a month. He then developed training exercises and played against his daughter. Three months later, Lenglen travelled to Paris to play on a proper clay court owned by her father&#x27;s friend, Dr. Cizelly. At Cizelly&#x27;s recommendation, she entered a local high-level tournament in Chantilly. In the singles handicap event, Lenglen won four rounds and finished in second place.

Lenglen&#x27;s success at the Chantilly tournament prompted her father to train her more seriously. He studied the leading male and female players and decided to teach Lenglen the tactics from the men&#x27;s game, which were more aggressive than the women&#x27;s style of slowly constructing points from the baseline. When the family returned to Nice towards the end of autumn, her father arranged for her to play twice a week at the Nice Lawn Tennis Club even though children had never been allowed on the courts, and had her practise with leading male players at the club. Lenglen began training with Joseph Negro, the club&#x27;s teaching professional. Negro had a wide variety of shots in his repertoire and trained Lenglen to play the same way. As Lenglen&#x27;s primary coach, her father employed harsh and rigorous methods, saying, &quot;I was a hard taskmaster, and although my advice was always well intentioned, my criticisms were at times severe, and occasionally intemperate.&quot; Lenglen&#x27;s parents watched her matches and discussed her minute errors between themselves throughout, showing restraint in their criticisms only when she was sick. As a result, Lenglen became comfortable with appearing ill, which made it difficult for others to tell if she was sick.

==Amateur career==
===1912–13: Maiden titles===
Lenglen entered her first non-handicap singles event in July 1912 at the Compiègne Championships near her hometown, her only regular event of the year. She won her debut match in the quarterfinals before losing her semifinal to Jeanne Matthey. She also played in the singles and mixed doubles handicap events, winning both of them. When Lenglen returned to Nice in 1913, she entered a handicap doubles event in Monte Carlo with Elizabeth Ryan, an American who had moved to England a year earlier. Although they lost the final in three sets, Ryan became Lenglen&#x27;s most frequent doubles partner and the pair never lost another match. Lenglen&#x27;s success at handicap events led her to enter more regular events in the rest of 1913. She debuted at the South of France Championships at the Nice Club in March, winning only one match. Nonetheless, when Lenglen returned to Compiègne, she won her first two regular singles titles, both within a few weeks of her 14th birthday. After losing to Matthey again at both of her events in July, the latter of which by default, Lenglen rebounded to win titles in her last two singles events of the year.

===1914: World Hard Court champion===
Back on the Riviera in 1914, Lenglen focused on regular events. Her victory in singles against the high-ranking British player Ruth Winch was regarded as a huge surprise by the tennis community. However, Lenglen still struggled at larger tournaments early in the year, losing to Ryan in the quarterfinals at Monte Carlo and six-time Wimbledon champion Dorothea Lambert Chambers in the semifinals at the South of France Championships. In May, Lenglen was invited to enter the French Championships, which was restricted to French players. The format gave the defending champion a bye until the final match, known as the challenge round. In that match, they faced the winner of the All Comers&#x27; competition, a standard tournament bracket for the remaining players. Lenglen won the All Comers&#x27; singles draw of six players to make it to the challenge round against Marguerite Broquedis. Despite winning the first set, she lost the match. This was the last time in Lenglen&#x27;s career she lost a completed singles match, and the only time she lost a singles final other than by default. Although she also lost the doubles challenge round at the tournament to Blanche and Suzanne Amblard, Lenglen won the mixed doubles title with Max Decugis as her partner.

Lenglen&#x27;s performance at the French Championships set the stage for her debut at the World Hard Court Championships, one of the major tournaments recognised by the International Lawn Tennis Federation at the time. She won the singles final against Germaine Golding for her first major title. The only set she lost during the event was to Suzanne Amblard in the semifinals. Her volleying ability was instrumental in defeating Amblard, and her ability to outlast Golding in long rallies gave her the advantage in the final. Lenglen also won the doubles title with Ryan over the Amblard sisters without dropping a game in the final. She finished runner-up in mixed doubles to Ryan and Decugis. Following the World Hard Court Championships, Lenglen could have debuted at Wimbledon, but her father decided against it. He did not like her chances of defeating Lambert Chambers on grass, a surface on which she had never competed, given that she had already lost to her earlier in the year on clay.

===World War I hiatus===
After World War I began in August 1914, tournaments ceased, interfering with Lenglen&#x27;s father&#x27;s plan for her to enter Wimbledon in 1915. During the war, Lenglen&#x27;s family lived at their home in Nice, an area less affected by the war than northern France. Although there were no tournaments, Lenglen had plenty of opportunity to train in Nice. Soldiers came to the Riviera to temporarily avoid the war, including leading tennis players such as two-time United States national champions R. Norris Williams and Clarence Griffin. These players competed in charity exhibitions primarily in Cannes to raise money for the French Red Cross. Lenglen participated and had the opportunity to play singles matches against male players.

===1919: Classic Wimbledon final===
Many tournaments resumed in 1919, following the end of World War I. Lenglen won nine singles titles in ten events, all four of her doubles events, and eight mixed doubles titles in ten events. She won the South of France Championships in March without dropping a game in any of her four matches. Although the French Championships and World Hard Court Championships did not return until the following year, Lenglen was able to debut at Wimbledon in July. She won the six-round All Comers&#x27; bracket, losing only six games in the first four rounds. Her biggest challenge in the All Comers&#x27; competition was her doubles partner Ryan, who saved match points and levelled the second set of their semifinal at five games, losing only after an hour-long rain delay. Although the 20-year-old Lenglen was considered a favourite against the 40-year-old Lambert Chambers in the challenge round, Lambert Chambers was able to trouble Lenglen with well-placed drop shots. Lenglen won the first set 10–8 after both players saved two set points. After saving two match points, Lenglen won the third set 9–7 for her first Wimbledon title. The match set the record for most games in a Wimbledon women&#x27;s singles final with 44, since surpassed only by the 1970 final between Margaret Court and Billie Jean King. More than 8,000 people attended the match, well above the seating capacity of 3,500 on Centre Court. Lenglen defeated Lambert Chambers and Ethel Larcombe again in the doubles final with Ryan. She already lost to Ryan and Randolph Lycett in her mixed doubles quarterfinal, her only loss of the year in any discipline aside from defaults.

===1920: Olympic champion===
Lenglen began 1920 with five singles titles on the Riviera, three of which she won in lopsided finals against Ryan. However, Ryan was able to defeat Lenglen in mixed doubles at Cannes in windy conditions, Lenglen&#x27;s only mixed doubles loss of the year. Although the World Hard Court Championships returned in May, Lenglen withdrew due to illness. She recovered in time for the French Championships two weeks later and won the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles titles to complete a triple crown. Lenglen easily made it to the challenge round in singles, where she defeated Broquedis in a rematch of the 1914 final. She won the doubles event with Élisabeth d&#x27;Ayen and defended her mixed doubles title with Decugis, only needing to play the challenge round.

Lenglen&#x27;s next event was Wimbledon. Lambert Chambers won the All Comers&#x27; final to set up a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s final. Although the match was expected to be close again and began 2–2, Lenglen won ten of the last eleven games for her second consecutive Wimbledon singles title. She won the triple crown, taking the doubles with Ryan and the mixed doubles with Australian Gerald Patterson. The doubles final was also a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s final against Lambert Chambers and Larcombe, and the mixed doubles victory came against defending champions Ryan and Lycett. Lenglen&#x27;s decision to partner with Patterson led to the Fédération Française de Lawn Tennis (FFLT) threatening to not pay her expenses for the Wimbledon trip unless she partnered with a compatriot. Lenglen and her father replied by paying for the trip themselves. After Wimbledon, Lenglen won both of her events in Belgium in the lead-up to the Olympic Games in Antwerp. At the Olympics, Lenglen won two gold medals and one bronze medal for France. She won the singles title over British player Dorothy Holman, losing only four games in the entire event. She won mixed doubles with Decugis, overcoming an opening set loss in their quarterfinal. Lenglen partnered with d&#x27;Ayen again in the doubles event, losing their semifinal to Kathleen McKane and Winifred McNair in a tight match that ended 8–6 in the decisive third set. This match was Lenglen&#x27;s only loss in doubles all year. Their opponents in the bronze medal match defaulted.

===1921: Only singles defeat post-World War I===
Lenglen again dominated the tournaments on the Riviera in 1921, winning eight titles in singles, six in doubles, and seven in mixed doubles. Her only loss came in mixed doubles. She won all of her matches against Ryan, four in singles and five in mixed doubles. All of Lenglen&#x27;s doubles titles on the Riviera were with Ryan.

Lenglen defended her triple crown at the French Championships. Later that month, she returned to the World Hard Court Championships, where five-time United States national singles champion Molla Mallory was making her debut. The United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) sent Mallory and Bill Tilden to the tournament with the hope of drawing Lenglen over to compete in the United States. Although Lenglen defeated Mallory in the final in straight sets, she trailed 2–3 in the second set before winning the last four games. Lenglen won the triple crown at the tournament, partnering with Golding in doubles and Jacques Brugnon in mixed doubles. She then won her third consecutive Wimbledon titles in both singles and doubles, defeating her doubles partner Ryan in a lopsided singles final. She withdrew from the mixed doubles event after her partner suffered an ankle injury.

Lenglen planned to compete at the U.S. National Championships in August to prove she deserved to be called a world champion. Due to illness delaying her trip, however, she did not make it to New York until three days before her opening match and was still sick when she arrived. After Lenglen&#x27;s opening round opponent defaulted, the tournament rescheduled her second round match against Mallory for that night to appease the large crowd that showed up to see Lenglen play. With more than 8,000 people in attendance, Mallory took a 2–0 lead in the first set before Lenglen began coughing in the third game. After losing the first set, Lenglen retired from the match two points into the second set for her only singles loss after World War I. She played only two more matches in the United States, both small exhibitions, before leaving in late September.

===1922: Start of 179-match win streak===
During the 1922 season, Lenglen did not lose a match in any discipline other than by default. She did not return to competitive tennis until March, six months after her loss to Mallory. Lenglen&#x27;s first tournament back was the South of France Championships, where she won the doubles and mixed doubles titles. She did not play the singles event and did not play singles again until a month later at the Beausoleil Championships in Monte Carlo, where she won the title without dropping a game. This tournament began a 179-match win streak that Lenglen continued through the end of her amateur career.

In the middle of the year, Lenglen won triple crowns at the World Hard Court Championships, the French Championships, and Wimbledon. At the first, she saved two set points in her semifinal against McKane before winning the set 10–8. Needing to play only three challenge round matches at the French, Lenglen agreed to forgo the challenge round system at Wimbledon and be included in the main draw at the request of the tournament organisers. In the singles final, she faced Mallory in a rematch of their U.S. National Championship meeting. Like in the United States, Mallory won the first two games of the final. However, Lenglen rebounded and won the next twelve games for the title. The final remains the shortest in Wimbledon history, lasting only 26 minutes.

===1923: Career-best 45 titles===
Lenglen entered more events and won more titles in 1923 than any other year. She won all 16 of the singles events she entered, as well as 13 of 14 doubles events, and 16 of 18 mixed doubles events. Unlike previous years, she did not default a match in any discipline. At the beginning of the season, Mallory travelled to France to make her debut on the French Riviera circuit. Lenglen and Mallory had their last encounter at the South of France Championships, which Mallory entered after not performing well at her other two events on the Riviera. Lenglen defeated her without losing a game. At the same tournament, Lenglen&#x27;s twelve-month win streak across all disciplines came to an end with a mixed doubles loss to Ryan and Lycett.

At what was to be the last edition of the World Hard Court Championships, Lenglen faced McKane in the final in each event, all three of which were held in the same afternoon. She defeated McKane in singles and mixed doubles, the latter of which was with Henri Cochet as her partner for the second consecutive year. With Ryan absent, however, Lenglen partnered with Golding and lost to the British team of McKane and Geraldine Beamish. At the French Championships, Lenglen defended her triple crown without losing a set in spite of the challenge round format being abandoned. She partnered with Brugnon in mixed doubles for the third straight year, and paired with Julie Vlasto for the first time in doubles. She faced the most adversity in the singles final when the crowd uncharacteristically booed her for trailing 0–4 to Golding in the second set. At Wimbledon, Lenglen won the singles and doubles titles with ease, never dropping more than three games in a set. In mixed doubles, however, she was defeated by Ryan and Lycett for the second time in the year. In September, Lenglen travelled outside of France and won titles in Belgium, Spain, and Portugal.

===1924: No major titles===
Although Lenglen did not lose a match in any discipline in 1924 except by default, she did not win a major tournament for the first time since 1913 aside from her hiatus due to World War I. Minor illnesses limited her to three singles events on the Riviera. Lenglen played doubles more regularly, winning eight titles in both doubles and mixed doubles. In April, Lenglen travelled to Spain to compete at the Barcelona International. Although she won all three events, she contracted jaundice soon after, preventing her from playing the French Championships. Although she had not fully recovered by Wimbledon, she entered the tournament and won her first three singles matches without dropping a game. In the next round, however, Ryan proved to be a more difficult opponent and took the second set from Lenglen 8–6, only the third set of singles Lenglen had lost since World War I. Although Lenglen narrowly won the match, she then withdrew from the tournament following the advice of her doctor. She did not play another event the rest of the year, and in particular missed the Olympic Games in Paris, where Helen Wills won the women&#x27;s singles event.

===1925: Open French champion===
Lenglen returned to tennis at the Beau Site New Year Meeting in Cannes the first week of the year, winning in doubles with Ryan in her only event. She played singles at only two tournaments on the Riviera, including the South of France Championships. Her only loss during this part of the season was to Ryan and Umberto de Morpurgo at the Côte d&#x27;Azur Championships in Cannes. In May, Lenglen entered the French Championships, the inaugural edition open to international players. The tournament was played at St. Cloud at the site of the defunct World Hard Court Championships. Lenglen won the triple crown and was not challenged in singles or mixed doubles. She won the singles final over McKane, losing only three games. She won the mixed doubles final with Brugnon against her doubles partner Julie Vlasto and Cochet. Although Lenglen and Vlasto lost the second set of the doubles final 9–11 to McKane and Evelyn Colyer, they won the other two sets with ease for the title.

Lenglen followed her performance at the French Championships with another triple crown at Wimbledon. She played five singles matches and did not lose a game in the second set of any of them. The five games she dropped in total remain a record for fewest games lost in a singles title run in Wimbledon history. Her opponents included Ryan in her opening match, the defending champion McKane in the semifinals, and Joan Fry in the final. In mixed doubles, she partnered with Jean Borotra to defeat Ryan and de Morpurgo in the final. In doubles, Lenglen and Ryan played their last tournament together and won the title without dropping a set. During the last part of the year, Lenglen led France to a 7–4 victory in a tie against Australia, and defeated Australasian champion Daphne Akhurst in the final of the concurrent Deauville tournament. Later in the year, Lenglen won the doubles and mixed doubles events at the Cromer Covered Courts Championships, the only time she played in England other than Wimbledon and her only indoor wood tournament.

===1926: Match of the Century===

The 1926 season unexpectedly was Lenglen&#x27;s last as an amateur. At the beginning of the season, three-time reigning U.S. national champion Helen Wills travelled to the French Riviera with the hope of playing a match against Lenglen. With Wills&#x27;s level of stardom approaching that of Lenglen&#x27;s, there was an immense amount of hype for a match between them to take place. They entered the same singles draw only once, at the Carlton Club in Cannes. When Lenglen and Wills both made the final with little opposition, the club doubled the number of seats around their main court and all three thousand seats plus standing room sold out. Spectators unable to get into the venue attempted to watch the match by climbing trees and ladders or by purchasing unofficial tickets for the windows and roofs of villas across the street. In what was called the Match of the Century, Lenglen defeated Wills in straight sets. The first match point became chaotic when a winner from Wills was called out by a spectator, leading everyone but the officials to believe the match was over. Photographers captured the moment as the players shook hands at the net and the crowd began flooding the court. After clarification that the shot had been in, Wills broke Lenglen to level the set. Despite Lenglen&#x27;s winning, her reputation of being unbeatable was damaged by Wills&#x27;s competitive performance.

While Wills remained in France, Lenglen avoided a rematch on the Riviera. After Wills&#x27;s season was marred by an appendectomy during the French Championships, she withdrew from both Grand Slam tournaments in Europe and another match between her and Lenglen never took place. In Wills&#x27;s absence, Lenglen defended all three of her titles at the French Championships with ease, defeating Mary Browne in the singles final. She again won the doubles with Vlasto and the mixed doubles with Brugnon.

====Wimbledon misunderstanding====
Although Lenglen was a heavy favourite at Wimbledon with Wills not participating, she began the tournament facing two issues. She was concerned with her family&#x27;s finances as her father&#x27;s health was worsening, and she was not content with the FFLT wanting her to enter the doubles event with a French partner instead of her usual partner Ryan. Although Lenglen agreed to play with Vlasto as the FFLT wanted, she was unsettled by being drawn against Ryan in her opening doubles match.

Lenglen&#x27;s situation did not improve once the tournament began. She opened the singles event with an uncharacteristic win against Browne in which she lost five games, the same number she had lost in the entire 1925 singles event. Her next singles match was then moved before her doubles match to accommodate the royal family, who planned to be in attendance. Wanting to play doubles first, Lenglen asked for the match to be rescheduled. Although the request was never received, she arrived at the grounds late. After Wimbledon officials confronted her in anger over keeping Queen Mary waiting, she refused to play. The club ultimately adhered to Lenglen&#x27;s wishes and rescheduled both matches with the doubles first. Nonetheless, Lenglen and Vlasto were defeated by Ryan and Browne in three sets while the crowd who typically supported Lenglen turned against her. Although she defeated Evelyn Dewhurst in the rescheduled singles match, she then withdrew from both singles and mixed doubles, ending her last amateur tournament.

==Professional career==
===United States tour (1926–27)===
A month after her withdrawal from Wimbledon, Lenglen signed a $50,000 contract (equivalent to about $ in 2020) with American sports promoter C. C. Pyle to headline a four-month professional tour in the United States beginning in October 1926. She had begun discussing a professional contract with Pyle&#x27;s associate William Pickens when he visited her on the Riviera in April. Lenglen had previously turned down an offer of 200,000 francs (equivalent to about $ in 2020) to turn professional in the United States following her last victory over Molla Mallory in 1923, declining in large part to keep her amateur status. She became less concerned with that, however, after the crowd turned against her at Wimbledon. She was more interested in keeping her social status, and was convinced by Pyle that turning professional would not hurt her stardom or damage her reputation. With Lenglen on the tour, Pyle attempted to recruit other top players, including Wills, McKane, and leading Americans Bill Tilden and Bill Johnston. Although they all declined, Pyle was able to sign Mary Browne as well as men&#x27;s players Vincent Richards, Paul Féret, Howard Kinsey, and Harvey Snodgrass. Richards was regarded as the biggest star among the male players, having won gold medals in singles and doubles at the 1924 Olympics. Once the tour began, Lenglen and all of the other players lost their amateur status.

Although professional tennis tournaments already existed, the tour was the first travelling professional exhibition series in tennis history. It featured 40 stops, starting on 9 October 1926 and ending on 14 February 1927, and included several stops in Canada as well as one in Cuba. Lenglen dominated Browne on the tour, winning all 33 of the best-of-three-set matches played to completion. Browne did not win a set until the second set at the 33rd stop. The only other set she won was the only set they played at the 36th stop, where Lenglen had decided to play just a one-set match while ill to avoid disappointing the fans. Browne also nearly won a set at the 23rd stop, losing 9–11, at which point Lenglen decided not to continue.

The tour was a financial success. Lenglen earned the most money, receiving half of the revenue from ticket sales and $100,000 in total, more than the $70,000 that Babe Ruth earned in 1927 as the highest-paid player in Major League Baseball. The average attendance was just over four thousand at the 34 venues where it was recorded. The most well-attended venues were opening night at Madison Square Garden in New York City with an attendance of thirteen thousand and the Public Auditorium in Cleveland with an attendance of ten thousand. Opening night in particular brought in $34,000 from tickets sold at $1.50 to $5.50 (equivalent to $ to $ in 2020).

===British tour (1927)===
A few months after the end of the United States tour, Lenglen signed with British promoter Charles Cochran to headline a shorter professional tour in the United Kingdom. Cochran recruited Dora Köring, the 1912 Olympic silver medalist in singles, and Dewhurst to play against Lenglen. Karel Koželuh and Kinsey were the male players on the tour. There were seven tour stops, all in July 1927. Lenglen won all seven of her singles matches, never losing more than five games in any of them. The last three stops were played on the grounds of association football clubs: Queen&#x27;s Park in Glasgow, Blackpool, and Manchester United. These were the best attended events on the tour and the final match at Old Trafford had an attendance of over fifteen thousand, the highest between either professional tour.

===Aftermath===
Lenglen was widely criticised for her decision to turn professional. Once the tour began, the FFLT expelled her and Féret while the All England Lawn Tennis Club revoked her membership. Lenglen in turn criticised amateur tennis for her nearing poverty. In the program for the United States professional tour, she stated, &quot;In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis... And in my whole lifetime I have not earned $5,000 – not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study – tennis... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy – should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? Or should I smile at the prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune – for whom?&quot; She criticised the barriers that typically prevented ordinary people from becoming tennis players, stating, &quot;Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, and the fact of the matter is that only wealthy people &quot;do&quot; compete. Is that fair? Does it advance the sport?&quot; Lenglen did not participate in any other professional tours after 1927. She never formally applied to be reinstated as an amateur with the FFLT either. She had asked about the possibility in 1932 after Féret was reinstated, but was told to wait another three years and decided against it.

==Rivalries==
===Lenglen vs. Mallory===
Molla Mallory was the only player to defeat Lenglen in singles after World War I. Fifteen years older than Lenglen and originally from Norway, Mallory won a bronze medal at the 1912 Olympic Games before emigrating to the United States in 1914. While World War I halted tennis in Europe, Mallory established herself as the top-ranked American player, winning the first four U.S. National Championships she entered from 1915 through 1918. Whereas Lenglen regularly came to the net and had an all-court game built around control rather than power, the much older Mallory played almost exclusively from the baseline. The strengths of Mallory&#x27;s game were that she took the ball early and had one of the most powerful forehands in women&#x27;s tennis at the time. Mallory had a similar personality to Lenglen off the court. While they each hated losing, both of them smoked regularly and loved to dance. Lenglen faced Mallory just four times in singles, compiling a 3–1 record. She also won both of their doubles and mixed doubles encounters.

Their first two meetings were highlighted by Lenglen&#x27;s health issues. In the final of the 1921 World Hard Court Championships, Lenglen nearly retired while struggling with blisters on her foot and trailing in the second set. Nonetheless, Lenglen proceeded to win by following her plan to play defensively and wait for Mallory to make unforced errors on attempted winners. In their second meeting at the 1921 U.S. National Championships, Mallory was able to take advantage of Lenglen&#x27;s poor health, executing her usual strategy of going for winners to win the match. Although they had entered the doubles event as partners, Lenglen&#x27;s health prevented them from playing any matches together at the tournament. Lenglen was able to easily win their last two meetings in 1922 and 1923 by playing more aggressively and employing Mallory&#x27;s strategy of hitting well-placed winners from the baseline.

The press built the rivalry between Lenglen and Mallory. After Lenglen&#x27;s retirement against Mallory at the U.S. National Championships, the vast majority of American newspapers criticised Lenglen for not finishing the match and accused her of retiring because she did not think she could win. They coined a phrase &quot;cough and quit&quot; that became popular at the time for describing someone who needed an excuse to avoid losing. After Lenglen&#x27;s victory over Mallory at Wimbledon, the American press returned to supporting Lenglen. Both Lenglen and Mallory believed the newspapers exaggerated the personal nature of their rivalry. Mallory in particular said, &quot;The newspapers are the dirtiest, filthiest things that ever happened. I don&#x27;t want my name in the newspapers. I have a better chance on the courts than in the newspapers of my own country.&quot;

===Lenglen and Ryan===
Lenglen&#x27;s usual doubles partner Elizabeth Ryan was also her most frequent opponent in singles. Born in the United States, Ryan travelled to England in 1912 to visit her sister before deciding to stay there permanently. Although she lost all four of her appearances in major finals, Ryan won 26 major titles between doubles and mixed doubles. The biggest strength of her game was volleying. Tennis writer Ted Tinling said, &quot;volleying as a fundamental, aggressive technique was first injected into the women&#x27;s game by Ryan.&quot; Lenglen and Ryan first partnered together at a handicap event in Monte Carlo in 1913 when they were 13 and 20 years old respectively. After losing the final at that tournament, the two of them never lost a regular doubles match, only once dropping a set in 1923 to Dorothea Lambert Chambers and Kathleen McKane, again at Monte Carlo. Ryan was Lenglen&#x27;s doubles partner for 40 of her 74 doubles titles, including all six at Wimbledon and two of three at the World Hard Court Championships.

Ryan defeated Lenglen in their first singles meeting in straight sets at Monte Carlo in 1914 and also won a set in their second meeting two months later. Following their first encounter, Lenglen won all 17 of their remaining matches, including five at Wimbledon and two major finals. The only time Ryan won a set against Lenglen after World War I was in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1924, where Lenglen withdrew due to illness in the following round. When the FFLT asked Lenglen to take a French partner in doubles at Wimbledon in 1926, Ryan partnered with Mary Browne to defeat Lenglen and her new partner Julie Vlasto, coming from three match points down in the second set. Ryan also won their only other doubles meeting in 1914. In mixed doubles, Lenglen compiled a 23–9 record against Ryan. Half of her career mixed doubles losses were to Ryan. After losing their first six encounters, she recovered to win the next thirteen. Lenglen won her first mixed doubles match against Ryan at the 1920 Beaulieu tournament, starting a win streak that ended with a loss to Ryan and Lycett at the 1923 South of France Championships.

===Overlap with Wills===
Helen Wills was the closest to becoming Lenglen&#x27;s counterpart. Wills finished her career with 19 Grand Slam singles titles, a record that stood until 1970. She succeeded Lenglen as world No. 1 in 1927 and kept that ranking for the next six years and nine of the next twelve overall until 1938. Late in Lenglen&#x27;s amateur career, Wills had built a similar level of stardom to Lenglen by winning the 1924 Olympic gold medal in singles in Lenglen&#x27;s absence while still only 18 years old. Although their careers overlapped when Wills visited Europe in 1924 and 1926, Lenglen faced Wills only once in her career. Lenglen withdrew from Wimbledon and the Olympics due to jaundice in 1924, and Wills withdrew from the French Championships and Wimbledon in 1926 due to appendicitis, preventing a longer rivalry between tennis&#x27;s two biggest female stars of the 1920s from emerging.

==Playing style==
Describing Lenglen&#x27;s all-court style of play, Elizabeth Ryan said: &quot;[Lenglen] owned every kind of shot, plus a genius for knowing how and when to use them. She never gave an opponent the same kind of shot twice in a row. She&#x27;d make you run miles... her game was all placement and deception and steadiness. I had the best drop shot anybody ever had, but she could not only get up to it but was so fast that often she could score a placement off it.&quot; Her rivals Molla Mallory and Helen Wills both noted that Lenglen excelled at extending rallies and could take control of points with defensive shots. Although Lenglen built her game around control rather than power, she had the ability to hit powerful shots. In particular, Mallory praised the power behind her defensive shots, saying, &quot;She is just the steadiest player that ever was. She just sent back at me whatever I sent at her and waited for me to make a fault. And her returns often enough were harder than the shots I sent up to her.&quot; British journalist A. E. Crawley regarded her as having the best movement of her time, saying, &quot;I have never seen on a lawn tennis court either man or woman move with such mechanical and artistic perfection and poise. Whether [Lenglen&#x27;s] objective is the ball or merely changing sides, she reminded you of the movement of fire over prairie grass.&quot; He believed she was a powerful server and an aggressive volleyer, commenting, &quot;She serves with all the male athlete&#x27;s power. She smashes with the same loose and rapid action, the release of a spring of steel. Her volley is not a timid push, but an arrow from the bow. And an arrow from the bow is Suzanne herself.&quot;

Adopting a style of play drawn from men&#x27;s players led Lenglen to become one of the leading volleyers in women&#x27;s tennis at a time when the women&#x27;s game was centred around playing from the baseline, even for the top players. Lenglen aimed to come to the net to finish points quickly whenever possible. Kathleen McKane specifically noted that &quot;Suzanne volleyed like a man&quot; when describing her influence on women&#x27;s tennis. While Lenglen did not model the majority of her game after any specific player, she modelled her forehand after that of Anthony Wilding. Like Wilding, she aimed to hit forehands flat and with little to no topspin. She used a continental grip and strived to hit balls early on the rise. Lenglen wrote in her book &quot;Lawn Tennis for Girls&quot;: &quot;A favorite shot of mine is the backhand down the line&quot;. Lenglen was regarded as having a graceful style of play. Her movement was thought to resemble that of a dancer, a style that may have arisen from a course on classic Greek dance she had taken as a child. René Lacoste, a leading French men&#x27;s tennis player from her era, said, &quot;[Lenglen] played with marvelous ease the simplest strokes in the world. It was only after several games that I understood what harmony was concealed by her simplicity, what wonderful mental and physical balance was hidden by the facility of her play.&quot;

Lenglen developed a reputation for drinking cognac to help her play at pivotal points of her biggest matches. Most notably, she did so during the second and third sets of her victory against Lambert Chambers in the 1919 Wimbledon final, and at the start and during the more competitive second set of her victory over Helen Wills in the Match of the Century. She travelled to the U.S. National Championships in 1921 only after the USLTA agreed to supply her with alcohol during her stay even though its sale was illegal under the laws of Prohibition at the time. Nonetheless, they did not provide Lenglen with alcohol during her retirement loss to Mallory.

==Legacy==
===Achievements===
Lenglen was ranked as the 24th greatest player in history in the &quot;100 Greatest of All Time&quot; television series. She was the ninth-highest ranked woman overall, and the highest-ranked woman to play exclusively in the amateur era. After formal annual women&#x27;s tennis rankings began to be published by tennis journalist and player A. Wallis Myers in 1921, Lenglen was No. 1 in the world in each of the first six editions of the rankings through her retirement from amateur tennis in 1926. She won a total of 250 titles consisting of 83 in singles, 74 in doubles, and 93 in mixed doubles. Nine of her singles titles were won without losing a game. Lenglen compiled win percentages of 97.9% in singles and 96.9% across all disciplines. After World War I, she won 287 of 288 singles matches, starting with a 108-match win streak and ending with a 179-match win streak, the latter of which was longer than Helen Wills&#x27;s longest win streak of 161 matches. Lenglen ended her career on a 250-match win streak on clay.

Lenglen&#x27;s eight Grand Slam women&#x27;s singles titles are tied for the tenth-most all-time, and tied for fourth in the amateur era behind only Maureen Connolly&#x27;s nine, Court&#x27;s thirteen, and Wills&#x27;s nineteen. Aside from the 1919 Wimbledon Championships, Lenglen did not lose more than three games in a set in any of her other Grand Slam or World Hard Court Championship singles finals. Lenglen&#x27;s six Wimbledon titles are tied for the sixth-most in history. Her former record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles has since been matched only by Martina Navratilova, who won her sixth in a row in 1987. Lenglen&#x27;s title at the 1914 World Hard Court Championships made her the youngest major champion in tennis history at 15 years and 16 days old, nearly a year ahead of the next two youngest, Martina Hingis and Lottie Dod.

Lenglen won a total of 17 titles at Wimbledon, 19 at the French Championships, and 10 at the World Hard Court Championships across all disciplines. Lenglen completed three Wimbledon triple crowns – winning the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles events at a tournament in the same year – in 1920, 1922, and 1925. She also won two triple crowns at the World Hard Court Championships in 1921 and 1922, and six at the French Championships, the first four of which came consecutively from 1920 through 1923 when the tournament was invitation-only to French nationals and the last two of which came in 1925 and 1926 when the tournament was open to internationals.

===Mythical persona===
Following World War I, Lenglen became a symbol of national pride in France in a country looking to recover from the war. The French press referred to Lenglen as &quot;notre Suzanne&quot; (our Suzanne) to characterise her status as a national heroine; and more eminently as &quot;La Divine&quot; (The Goddess) to assert her unassailability. The press wrote about Lenglen as if she were infallible at tennis, often attributing any performance that was relatively poor by her standards to various excuses such as the fault of her doubles partner or to having concern over the health of her father. Journalists who criticised Lenglen were condemned and refuted by the rest of the press. At the Olympics, she introduced herself to journalists as &quot;The Great Lenglen&quot;, a title that was well received. Before matches, Lenglen would predict to the press that she was going to win, a practice that Americans treated as improper. She explained, &quot;When I am asked a question I endeavour to give a frank answer. If I know I am going to win, what harm is there in saying so?&quot;

Lenglen was the first female athlete to be acknowledged as a celebrity outside of her sport. She was acquainted with members of royal families such as King Gustav V of Sweden, and actresses such as Mary Pickford. She was well known by the general public, and her matches were well-attended by people not otherwise interested in tennis. Many of her biggest matches were sold out, including the 1919 Wimbledon final against Lambert Chambers, where the attendance more than doubled the seating capacity of Centre Court, and her first match against Mallory, where tickets were sold at a cost of up to 500 francs (about $ in 2020) and an estimated five thousand people could not gain entry to see the match after it had sold out. The popularity of Lenglen&#x27;s matches at Wimbledon was a large factor in the club moving the tournament from Worple Road to its modern site at Church Road. A new Centre Court opened in 1922 with a seating capacity of nearly ten thousand, nearly three times larger than that at the old venue. At the Match of the Century against Wills, seated tickets that were sold out at 300 francs, then equivalent to about $11 in the United States (or $ in 2020), were re-sold by scalpers at up to 1200 francs, which was then about $44 (or $ in 2020). This cost far exceeded that for the men&#x27;s singles final at the U.S. National Championships at the time, which were sold at as low as $2 per seat (about $ in 2020).

Lenglen&#x27;s mythical reputation began at a young age. She was known for a story about her father training her to improve her shot precision as a child by placing a handkerchief at different locations on the court and instructing her to hit it as a target. She was said to be able to hit the handkerchief with ease regardless of the type of incoming shot. Each time she did, he would fold it in half before replacing it with a coin. It was said that Lenglen could hit the coin up to five times in a row.

===Professional tennis===
Lenglen was the first leading tennis player to leave amateur tennis to play professionally, thereby launching playing tennis as a professional career. The exhibition tour she headlined in the United States from 1926 to 1927 in which a few players travelled together to compete against each other across a series of venues was the first of its kind. It established a format that was repeated over twenty times for the next four decades until the start of the Open Era. With Pyle interested in tennis only because of Lenglen, Vincent Richards, the leading male player on Lenglen&#x27;s United States tour, organised the next such tour featuring himself competing against Karel Koželuh in 1928. He also began organising the first major professional tournaments to feature players who had been top amateurs, beginning with the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships first held later in 1927.

As the top women&#x27;s players nearly all kept their amateur status, women were largely left out of both the travelling exhibition tours and the growing professional tournaments after Lenglen&#x27;s playing career ended. The next significant exhibition tour to feature women&#x27;s tennis players did not occur until 1941 when Alice Marble became one of the headliners on a tour that also featured leading male players Don Budge and Bill Tilden. Fellow top-ranked players Pauline Betz and Althea Gibson followed Marble by turning professional in 1947 and 1958 respectively. Betz played on two tours, one in 1947 and another from 1950 to 1951. Gibson played in a series of warmup matches for the Harlem Globetrotters, an exhibition basketball team in the United States.

===Women&#x27;s sportswear===
Lenglen redefined traditional women&#x27;s tennis attire early in her career. By the 1919 Wimbledon final, she avoided donning a corset in favour of a short-sleeved blouse and calf-length pleated skirt to go along with a distinctive circular-brimmed bonnet, a stark contrast with her much older opponent Dorothea Lambert Chambers who wore long sleeves and a plain skirt below the calf.

The following year, Lenglen ended the norm of women competing in clothes not suited for playing tennis. She had Jean Patou design her outfits that were not only intended to be stylish, but allowed her to perform her signature leaping ballet motion in points and did not restrict her movement on the court. This type of attire was among the earliest women&#x27;s sportswear. Unusual for the time, her blouse was sleeveless and her skirt extended only to her knees. Lenglen replaced the bonnet with a bandeau, which became known as the &quot;Lenglen bandeau&quot; and was her signature piece of attire throughout the rest of her career. On the court, she routinely wore makeup and popularised having tanned skin instead of a pale complexion that other players had preferred before her time. Later in her career, she moved away from just wearing white in favour of brighter-coloured outfits. Overall, she pioneered the idea of players using the tennis court to showcase fashion instead of just competing. Off the court, Lenglen frequently wore an oversized and expensive fur coat.

===Honours===
Lenglen is honoured in a variety of ways at the French Open. At Stade Roland Garros, Court Suzanne Lenglen – the second show court that was built in 1994 with a capacity of about ten thousand – was named after her in 1997. Outside the court, there is a bronze relief statue of Lenglen that was erected in 1994. The FFLT had originally planned to erect a statue of Lenglen immediately after her death, but this plan never materialised due to the start of World War II later that year. Additionally, one of the main entrances to the ground is &quot;Porte Suzanne Lenglen&quot;, which leads to &quot;Allée Suzanne Lenglen&quot;. Moreover, the women&#x27;s singles championship trophy was named the &quot;Coupe Suzanne Lenglen&quot; in 1987. In spite of her success at the French Championships, Lenglen never competed at Stade Roland Garros as it did not become the site for the tournament until 1928, after her retirement from amateur tennis.

Lenglen was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1978. Following her death, she was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honour. Another road, the Avenue Suzanne Lenglen, is named in her honour outside of the Nice Lawn Tennis Club. She has been honoured in a Google Doodle twice, once on her 117th birthday on 24 May 2016, and again on International Women&#x27;s Day on 8 March 2017.

==Personal life==
Lenglen was in a long-term relationship with Baldwin Baldwin from 1927 to 1932. Baldwin was the grandson and heir to Lucky Baldwin, a prominent businessman and real estate investor active in California. Lenglen met Baldwin during her professional tour in the United States. Although they intended to get married, those plans never materialised largely because Baldwin was already married and his wife would not agree to a divorce while Lenglen and Baldwin were together. During this time, her father died of poor health in 1929.

Lenglen was the author of several books on tennis, the first two of which she wrote during her amateur career. Her first book, &quot;Lawn Tennis for Girls&quot;, covered techniques and advice on tactics for beginner tennis players. She also wrote &quot;Lawn Tennis: The Game of Nations&quot; and a romantic novel, &quot;The Love Game: Being the Life Story of Marcelle Penrose&quot;. Lenglen finished her last book &quot;Tennis by Simple Exercises&quot; with Margaret Morris in 1937. The book featured a section by Lenglen on what was needed to become an all-around tennis player and a section by Morris, a choreographer and dancer, on exercises designed for tennis players. She played a role as an actress in the 1935 British musical comedy film &quot;Things Are Looking Up&quot;, in which she contests a tennis match against the lead character portrayed by Cicely Courtneidge.

Following her playing career, Lenglen returned to tennis as a coach in 1933, serving as the director of a school on the grounds of Stade Roland Garros. She opened her own tennis school for girls in 1936 at the Tennis Mirabeau in Paris with the support of the FFLT. She began instructing adults the following year as well. A year later in May 1938, Lenglen became the inaugural director of the French National Tennis School in Paris. Shortly after this appointment, however, Lenglen became severely fatigued while teaching at the school and needed to receive a blood transfusion. She previously had other health issues following her retirement, most notably suffering from appendicitis and having an appendectomy in October 1934. Lenglen died on 4 July 1938 at the age of 39, three weeks after she became ill, and was reported to have died from pernicious anemia. Her specific cause of death was unclear owing to anemia being curable, and to reports of her having other illnesses, including leukemia. Lenglen was buried at the Cimetière de Saint-Ouen just outside Paris.

<doc id="709344" wikidata="Q369197" url="?curid=709344" title="Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)">
<text>Black Widow is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by editor and plotter Stan Lee, scripter Don Rico, and artist Don Heck, the character debuted as an enemy of Iron Man in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #52 (1964). She reformed as a hero in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #30 (1966) and her primary design was introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #86 (1970). Black Widow has been the main character in several comic issues since 1970, and she received her own &quot;Black Widow&quot; series in 1999. She is frequently a supporting character in &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Daredevil&quot;.

Natalia Alianovna &quot;Natasha Romanoff&quot; Romanova (Russian: Наталья Альяновна &quot;Наташа&quot; Романова) is introduced as a spy for the Soviet Union until she defects to the United States. She subsequently joins the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., partners with Daredevil, and encounters a rival Black Widow in Yelena Belova. Though she has no distinct superpowers, she was augmented in the Red Room to increase her strength and reduce her aging. She has training in combat and espionage, and she wields a bracelet on each arm that fires electric shocks and projects wires to traverse skyscrapers.

Black Widow stories often explore her struggle to define her own identity as a spy and the trauma she endured from her life of training in the Red Room. Early stories emphasized her Soviet origin, portraying her superiors as evil and contrasting her with more noble American superheroes. Black Widow&#x27;s status as a leading female character and &quot;femme fatale&quot; has influenced her portrayal, which was often contradictory as comics grappled with the conflict between traditional gender roles and second-wave feminism. The character is heavily sexualized both by artists and by the characters with whom she interacts.

Black Widow has been adapted into a variety of other media, including film, animated series, and video games. Natasha Romanoff was portrayed by Scarlett Johansson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise from the character&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010) to her final one in &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021). Johannson&#x27;s portrayal brought increased attention to the character and influenced Black Widow&#x27;s depiction in comics.

==Publication history==
=== 1960s ===

Black Widow first appeared in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #52 (1964) as an opponent of Iron Man. She was designed by artist Don Heck for a story plotted by Stan Lee and written by Don Rico under the pseudonym N. Korok. The character was portrayed as a seductress who was spying on Tony Stark for the Soviet government, making her one of several Soviet villains who faced Iron Man in the 1960s. She was infatuated with Tony Stark&#x27;s looks and wealth and easily distracted by jewelry.

Black Widow first took the role of a supervillain in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #64 (1965) after the Soviet government gave her a costume and equipment when they forced her to continue working for them. Her first costume took the form of a blue bodysuit made primarily of fishnet-style webbing, a cape, and a mask designed to resemble the one used by Hawkeye. With the costume came her first use of tactical equipment, including gloves that let her adhere to walls and the weaponized bracelets that later became her primary weapon. She was the villain in five Iron Man stories, all within a span of twelve issues.

Black Widow next appeared as the villain in &quot;Avengers&quot; #29–30 (1966), where she manipulated Hawkeye, Power Man, and Swordsman into doing her bidding. At the end of the story, she reformed and allied with the Avengers, as her love for Hawkeye motivated her to switch sides after recovering from brainwashing by the Soviet government. This made her one of several Marvel Comics villains who become good by defecting from the Soviet Union to the United States, symbolizing a moral preference for American individualism over Soviet communism. Her redemption coincided with Marvel&#x27;s attempt at a more nuanced portrayal of Soviets and the Cold War.

Black Widow&#x27;s design underwent various changes as she appeared in the following issues of &quot;Avengers&quot;. The character&#x27;s backstory was expanded in &quot;Avengers&quot; #43 (1967), when she discovered that the secret identity of the Red Guardian was her husband Alexei, who had been presumed dead. This story explained that it was because of his supposed death that she trained to be a spy. After her redemption, Black Widow became associated with the fictional intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D.

=== 1970s ===
Black Widow went one year without being in any new comic books until she appeared in &quot;Avengers&quot; #76 (1970) to end her relationship with Hawkeye (then named Goliath), effectively making her an independent character. She then underwent a full redesign in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #86 (1970), where she was given the black costume and long red hair that became identified with her character. John Romita Sr. designed the costume, basing it on the 1940s &quot;Miss Fury&quot; comic strip. Marvel followed this the same year with a series of Black Widow stories published in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;, which also published stories about the Inhumans. Marvel&#x27;s first series to feature stories led by a female superhero, it portrayed Black Widow as a wealthy jet setter who doubled as a crime-fighter. The first issues, written by Gary Friedrich and illustrated by Gene Colan, were about political issues. Writers Roy Thomas and then Gerry Conway moved it away from politics in favor of melodrama, developing the relationship between Black Widow and her father figure Ivan Petrovich. &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; ran for eight issues before Black Widow was removed from the comic book so the Inhumans could have a standalone series.

As the writer for &quot;Daredevil&quot;, Conway introduced Black Widow as a supporting character and established a romance between her and Daredevil as &quot;a way to re-energize the title&quot;. She joined the series in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #81 (1971). Colan illustrated the series with drawings of Black Widow that emphasized her acrobatics and long red hair. Conway credited Colan with creating the &quot;first empowered sexy babe&quot; in comics. This run allowed for deeper characterization for Black Widow, and she was given a last name, Romanoff, in issue #82 (1971). Her story line in the series saw her framed for killing a supervillain, with Daredevil&#x27;s friend Foggy Nelson leading the prosecution. Conway then moved the setting to San Francisco, and their relationship became the main focus of the series. The pairing was one Marvel had to handle carefully given potential backlash to an unmarried couple living together, having them live on separate floors and having Ivan live with them. Responding to criticism that his treatment of Black Widow was sexist, Conway reworked her role beginning in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #91 (1972), having her stand up for herself when she felt neglected by Daredevil. The series was retitled &quot;Daredevil and the Black Widow&quot; in the following issue.

Steve Gerber became the writer for &quot;Daredevil&quot; with issue #97 (1972), and he moved the focus away from Black Widow back to Daredevil&#x27;s superhero activity in response to weak sales. Her name was dropped from the title after issue #107 (1973). She appeared in &quot;Avengers&quot; #111–112 (1973), but left the team almost immediately as she wished to return to Daredevil. Tony Isabella became the writer for &quot;Daredevil&quot; with issue #118, and feeling that the relationship dynamic between Daredevil and Black Widow harmed both characters, he set out to split them apart. She departed from the series in issue #124 (1975), with the character leaving by saying that she felt overshadowed by Daredevil and that he robbed her of her independence.

When Isabella began writing &quot;The Champions&quot;, he included Black Widow as a member. Originally intended to be a duo of Iceman and Angel, editor Len Wein mandated several changes to &quot;The Champions&quot;, including the requirement of a female character. Besides his experience writing for Black Widow, Isabella used her in hope that continuing to work with her would prevent another writer from reuniting her with Daredevil. The seventh issue of &quot;The Champions&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Created the Black Widow&quot;, focused on Black Widow&#x27;s backstory and introduced the villain Yuri Bezukhov, the son of Ivan Petrovich. Isabella wanted to continue this story by revealing Ivan to be Black Widow&#x27;s biological father, but he left Marvel Comics after completing the issue. &quot;The Champions&quot; ended after 16 issues, and Black Widow was returned to &quot;Avengers&quot; in issue #173 (1978) during the &quot;Korvac Saga&quot;. She returned to &quot;Daredevil&quot; as a supporting character in issues #155–165 (1978–1980).

=== 1980s ===
Black Widow was less prominent in the 1980s. She made an appearance in the anthology book &quot;Bizarre Adventures&quot; #25 (1981), as one of the superheroines leading a story written by Ralph Macchio and illustrated by Paul Gulacy under the issue&#x27;s &quot;Lethal Ladies&quot; theme. The story followed Black Widow as she infiltrated a Soviet arms depot in South Africa led by her former instructor. Macchio moved away from elements he felt were reminiscent of James Bond, instead looking to the works of John le Carré for inspiration so readers &quot;really didn&#x27;t know who were the good guys and the bad guys&quot;. Black Widow made another return to &quot;Daredevil&quot; beginning in issue #187 (1982), written by Frank Miller. She was redesigned during Miller&#x27;s run, giving her a more casual and masculine appearance with a gray leotard and shorter hair. She also appeared in the shared books &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; and &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;.

The anthology book &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot;, issues #10–13 (1983–1984) featured Black Widow in her next solo story. Written by Macchio and illustrated by George Pérez with other artists, this story had her pursue Ivan on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D. before discovering that he had been brainwashed. Macchio and Pérez had begun working on the story in 1978, but its intended publication was cancelled twice, in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; and then &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot;. Macchio made it explicit in this run that Black Widow killed adversaries when necessary and obtained information from another character by having sex with him, portraying things that were usually left ambiguous in comic books at the time.

=== 1990s ===
Black Widow appeared in three entries of the &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; line in the 1990s. &quot;Black Widow: The Coldest War&quot; (1990) is the 61st entry in the series, featuring Black Widow as she is tricked into believing that her husband is alive and is forced to work for the Soviet Union to save him. &quot;Punisher/Black Widow: Spinning Doomsday&#x27;s Web&quot; (1992) is the 74th entry in the series and features Black Widow working with the Punisher to defeat Malum. &quot;Daredevil/Black Widow: Abattoir&quot; (1993) is the 75th and final entry in the series, featuring Black Widow and Daredevil as they investigate the murders of telepaths. She then starred in separate graphic novel, &quot;Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty&quot; (1995). Although she shares the title with Nick Fury, he only briefly appears in the book, and she instead teams with Night Raven in his first appearance in Marvel&#x27;s mainline continuity.

Black Widow returned to her black jumpsuit in the 1990s and began working alongside Iron Man during the run of writer John Byrne and artist Paul Ryan, beginning in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #269 (1991). She again became a member of the Avengers with its new roster in &quot;Avengers&quot; #343 (1992). This led to her becoming the leader of the Avengers for a period of time. Her association with the Avengers increased her prominence among Marvel superheroes, allowing for appearances in &quot;Captain America&quot; and &quot;Force Works&quot;. Black Widow returned to &quot;Daredevil&quot; in issue #362 (1997), which had her become more vengeful as she responded to the Onslaught event that caused the apparent deaths of her allies in the Avengers. She reappeared in the new volume of the &quot;Avengers&quot;, but only infrequently as a guest character. Black Widow then starred in a three-issue arc, &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot;, by writer Scott Lobdell and penciller Randy Green, in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #517–519 (1998). At the same time, writer Kevin Smith had her return to &quot;Daredevil&quot; during the first storyline of its second volume. Black Widow&#x27;s &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; story was reprinted as a single volume in 1999, titled &quot;Black Widow: Web of Intrigue&quot;.

A new character, Yelena Belova, took the moniker Black Widow beginning in &quot;Inhumans&quot; #5 (1999). The two Black Widows came into conflict in the limited series &quot;Black Widow&quot; published the same year, which was written by Devin Grayson and illustrated by J. G. Jones, running for three issues. The series was part of the Marvel Knights imprint and encompassed a single story, &quot;The Itsy-Bitsy Spider&quot;. This was the first time a comic book series featured Black Widow as its sole main character; the only other title to do this was her standalone 1990 graphic novel.

=== 2000s ===
Grayson wrote a second three-issue &quot;Black Widow&quot; miniseries featuring the Natasha and Yelena Black Widows in 2001, alongside co-writer Greg Rucka and artist Scott Hampton. Black Widow returned to &quot;Daredevil&quot; in its &quot;The Widow&quot; storyline (2004) by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Alex Maleev. Richard K. Morgan wrote &quot;Black Widow: Homecoming&quot; in 2004 with Bill Sienkiewicz and Goran Parlov, simplifying Black Widow&#x27;s backstory into a consistent series of events. The series featured a more violent Black Widow and ran for six issues. Morgan then wrote another six-issue series, &quot;Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her&quot;, in 2006 with Sienkiewicz and Sean Phillips. This continued from the previous series and followed Black Widow as she went on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. An alternate version of Black Widow was created for the Ultimate Universe in the 2000s, where she is a member of the Ultimates.

&quot;Black Widow: Deadly Origin&quot; ran in 2009–2010, written by Paul Cornell and illustrated by Tom Raney and John Paul Leon. The series followed Black Widow&#x27;s history through flashbacks from different points in her life. The reimaginings of her earlier adventures had her wearing more modest costumes relative to her original appearances.

=== 2010s ===
Black Widow became more widely known to the public after the character was adapted to film in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010). The film&#x27;s emphasis on her as a spy instead of a superhero influenced how she was portrayed in comics over the following years. With the character&#x27;s popularity came additional publications, such as &quot;Black Widow and the Marvel Girls&quot; (2010), which was created by Salvador Espin, Veronica Gandini, Takeshi Miyazawa, and Paul Tobin.

&quot;Black Widow&quot; received a new volume, beginning with the &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; (2010) story arc. It was written by Marjorie Liu and illustrated by Daniel Acuña, the latter creating art influenced by film noir. The series was then transferred to writer Duane Swierczynski and artist Manuel Garcia for the &quot;Kiss and Kill&quot; story arc. Jim McCann wrote the &quot;Widowmaker&quot; limited series in 2010 with artist David López. The series was a crossover between &quot;Black Widow&quot; and the ongoing &quot;Hawkeye &amp; Mockingbird&quot; series. Black Widow also appeared as a main character in &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;.

A new &quot;Black Widow&quot; series was published under the Marvel Now! branding in 2014, created by Nathan Edmondson and Phil Noto. This series returned to Grayson&#x27;s characterization of Black Widow as more introspective than action-oriented. It was the longest running Black Widow series with 20 issues, ending in 2015 with the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event. &quot;Black Widow: Forever Red&quot;, a young adult novel featuring the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of Black Widow, was written by Margaret Stohl and released in 2015.

The next volume of &quot;Black Widow&quot; was introduced in 2016, written by Mark Waid and illustrated by Chris Samnee. These stories followed the lead of the cinematic version, exploring her work with S.H.I.E.L.D. and her experiences in the Red Room. Waid&#x27;s series ran for twelve issues. Horror writers Jen and Sylvia Soska wrote a &quot;Black Widow&quot; miniseries in 2019 with artist Flaviano, and Jody Houser wrote the five issue series &quot;Web of Black Widow&quot; the same year, with Stephen Mooney as its artist.

=== 2020s ===
Ralph Macchio joined artist Simon Buonfantino in a return to Black Widow with &quot;Black Widow: Widow&#x27;s Sting&quot; in 2020. The one-shot comic was written as a more traditional spy drama, using many of the genre&#x27;s common tropes. Kelly Thompson began writing a &quot;Black Widow&quot; series the same year, with Elena Casagrande as the volume&#x27;s artist. The series was split into three story arcs: &quot;The Ties that Bind&quot; introduced a brainwashed Black Widow who believed she lived a domestic life as a mother, &quot;I Am the Black Widow&quot; continued the story with her memory returned and a new team of sidekicks and partners fighting alongside her, and &quot;Die by the Blade&quot; concluded the 15-issue series with Black Widow and her team fighting a human-trafficking ring.

Black Widow&#x27;s character underwent a major redesign in &quot;Venom&quot; #26 (2023) when she became the host of a symbiote. She was given a new costume designed by CAFU, based on the appearance of Venom. The symbiote version of Black Widow made appearances in &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; by Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing, and Geraldo Borges, and then in &quot;Black Widow &amp; Hawkeye&quot; by writer Stephanie Phillips and artist Paolo Villaneli. As a symbiote host, Black Widow became a major character in the &quot;Venom War&quot; storyline. Her role in the story was introduced in the one shot &quot;Black Widow: Venomous&quot;, written by Erica Schultz and illustrated by Luciano Vecchio. She also appeared in a three-issue limited series, &quot;Venom War: Venomous&quot;, in late 2024, also created by Schultz and Vecchio.

== Characterization ==
=== Fictional character biography ===

Natalia &quot;Natasha&quot; Alianovna Romanova was born in Russia. She was thrown from a burning building in Stalingrad as an infant, where she is found and raised by the soldier Ivan Petrovich. The Hand attempts to kidnap and brainwash her in 1941, but she is rescued by Captain America and Wolverine. Natasha marries Alexei Shostakov, but the KGB fakes his death to motivate Natasha to become a spy. She trains in the Red Room, where she is augmented through biotechnology; the process brings her body to its physical peak and slows cellular degeneration, enabling her to remain young and in her prime for decades. The training program also gives her false memories of her life, leading her to believe that she had previously been a ballerina. She was selected from the participants in the training program to become a spy and receives the codename &quot;Black Widow&quot;.

Natasha goes to the United States to seduce Iron Man and later to fight the Avengers. After she stops cooperating, she is brainwashed by the Soviet government until her love for Hawkeye breaks through and causes her to reform. Although she considers joining the Avengers, she is not immediately trusted by the team. Natasha instead begins working with the intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and appears to betray the Avengers when she works as a double agent for the agency, causing her relationship with Hawkeye to end.

Natasha becomes an independent crime-fighter until she begins a relationship with Daredevil. After she is framed for murder and clears her name, Natasha moves in with Daredevil in San Francisco. She eventually leaves him and spends time alone in San Francisco in severe poverty. Natasha then becomes a Russian language instructor at UCLA and joins the short-lived superhero team the Champions, who appoint her as team leader. After the Champions disband, Natasha encounters the Hand, who poison her. Natasha dies as she reaches Daredevil to ask him for help, but one of his allies, Stone of the Chaste, brings her back to life. The KGB forces Natasha to work for them again by creating a Life Model Decoy of her deceased husband, acting as if he had survived and was being held hostage. She again worked for the KGB unwillingly when she discovered that she was a sleeper agent who had been programmed to obey upon activation.

After many instances of joining and leaving, Natasha becomes the leader of the Avengers alongside Black Knight. She is forced to dissolve the Avengers after most members are seemingly killed by Onslaught, but considering herself the last Avenger, she teams up with Daredevil to hunt the Avengers&#x27; enemies. Still feeling guilty for their failure, she chooses not to rejoin as a long-term member when the Avengers returned. While tracking a biotoxin, Natasha comes into conflict with another Black Widow, Yelena Belova, and both try to prove themselves as worthy of the title. Afterward, Natasha learns that there were many Black Widows and that the KGB had implanted false memories in her about her life before she was a spy.

As Norman Osborn takes power over S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s successor organization H.A.M.M.E.R., Natasha disguises herself as Yelena on the orders of Nick Fury to infiltrate Osborn&#x27;s Thunderbolts team. This Nick Fury is discovered to be a Life Model Decoy created by Osborn, and Natasha escapes to help Maria Hill revive Tony Stark, who had previously wiped his own mind. When Tony Stark becomes director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Black Widow operates alongside Bucky Barnes as he becomes the new Captain America.

When Hydra is in control of the American government, Black Widow is killed by an alternate version of Captain America working for Hydra. She is then reborn as a clone in a new Red Room, retaining all of her previous memories up to her death. Natasha spends a period of time brainwashed into believing that she lived a domestic life with a fiancé and a son. After recovering, she discovers and bonds with a symbiote in an Alchemax lab.

=== Personality and motivation ===
As a superhero, Black Widow seeks to right the wrongs she committed earlier in life. Despite this, she is more willing to kill adversaries than most superheroes and has been described as emotionally cold since her first appearance. She is naturally independent and capably works alone. Black Widow is confident in her physical attractiveness and is willing to use it to her advantage. She chooses not to wear a mask, which she sees as a statement of confidence in herself, though in her early crime-fighting stories she was uncertain about whether she would regret letting others see her face. Black Widow was less confident overall in the early days of her superhero career.

As Black Widow regularly takes up alter egos and false personas as a spy, the character struggles to define her own identity. When preparing to write for &quot;Black Widow&quot; in 1999, Grayson decided that the character would need &quot;tremendous strength and resolve&quot; to have an identity of her own. This identity crisis grew when Black Widow discovered that many of her memories, including the loss of her husband and her time as a professional ballerina, were faked by the Soviet Union.

=== Abilities and equipment ===
Black Widow was trained as a spy in the Red Room, and she possess expert knowledge about the practice of espionage. She uses her physical attractiveness to her advantage as a spy, manipulating others through seduction. Unlike many superheroes, Black Widow does not have superhuman powers. Instead, she underwent biochemical modification while training in the Red Room, increasing her physical prowess and slowing her aging. Black Widow is a master of hand-to-hand combat, with training in aikido, boxing, judo, karate, and savate. She also has training in most weapons and can operate most vehicles. Outside of combat, Black Widow is a gymnast, and she was taught ballet while in the Red Room. She is fluent in Chinese, English, French, German, and Russian, among other languages. As of the &quot;Venom War&quot; storyline, Black Widow has the powers of a symbiote host.

In combat, Black Widow uses a pair of bracelets that conceal her equipment, operated by galvanic sensors connected to the muscles in her wrists. When her primary design was established in 1970, they were equipped with tear gas pellets, a &quot;widow&#x27;s line&quot; wire to swing between buildings like Spider-Man and a &quot;widow&#x27;s bite&quot; electroshock weapon. The widow&#x27;s bite has a range of 20 feet and can emit up to 30,000 volts. The bracelets also function as radio transmitters. Besides her bracelets, Black Widow sometimes carries explosives in her belt. The fingers and feet of her outfit contain microscopic suction cups that adhere to surfaces with an electrostatic charge.

== Themes and motifs ==
=== Communism and Russophobia ===
Black Widow was first introduced as a Soviet communist, and her origin is defined by the Cold War. As a communist spy, she was a foil for Iron Man and his symbolic representation of American values, with the danger that Black Widow posed demonstrating the threat posed by the Soviet Union and communism. Moreover, her role as a spy suggested a sense of dishonesty and deceit from Soviets that contrasted with Iron Man&#x27;s role as a noble and selfless American; Black Widow was surprised to see Iron Man risk his life to save Soviets, suggesting that such morality was unfamiliar to the Soviet Union. When Black Widow chose to stop working for her Soviet handlers, they forced her to continue, first by threatening her parents and then by brainwashing her, symbolizing the Soviet Union&#x27;s image as a country without liberty. With her defection to the United States, Marvel reinforced its interpretation of Black Widow as an agent of good through her work with American superheroes, which stood in contrast to her villainous period with the Soviet Union.

Black Widow&#x27;s Soviet origin invokes a traumatic history for the character, reminiscent of the Soviet Union&#x27;s history; her surname, Romanova, invites comparison to the Romanov family that was killed during the Russian Revolution, drawing parallels of suffering at the hands of the Soviets. Her superiors in the Soviet government were portrayed as evil, and she was shown to fear them more than she feared her adversaries. Black Widow was drawn as beautiful in contrast to the typically brutish and ugly portrayal of Soviets in Marvel Comics, suggesting innocence among the Soviets and making her more appealing to the reader. &quot;Femme fatale&quot; characters frequently have origins in Russia, and Black Widow&#x27;s rejection of American gender roles in the 1960s reflected the otherness that she represented as an agent of the Soviet Union.

Ballet is commonly associated with Russia, and it has a specific association with discipline in the Russian Empire through the military and the royal court. The blending of ballet and military training draws upon the cultural competition of the Cold War. Images of Natasha alongside many identical ballerinas invokes the lack of individualism she faced in the Soviet Union. This theme is further explored when the Red Room creates clones of her.

=== Feminism and sexuality ===
Black Widow was the first solo female superhero created by Marvel Comics. Unlike most superheroines in the 1960s, she was not created to be a love interest or a female derivative of a male character, and she was not created to fulfill a motherly or domestic role. Black Widow further contrasted herself from other female Marvel characters in the 1960s by fighting her enemies in hand-to-hand combat. The character was created in a time of uncertainty around gender roles in the United States, as a growing feminist movement competed with traditional femininity. By the 1980s, differing cultural expectations of women meant that her portrayals varied significantly between these two focuses. Sometimes, Black Widow subverts gender roles, being the more ruthless figure that stands in contrast with the more empathetic male characters. Her characterization as a woman who rejects domesticity and poses a danger to men is representative of the female black widow spider, which kills and eats its male partner; in her first appearance, Black Widow is likened to the exotic dancer and alleged spy Mata Hari. Despite this, other aspects of Black Widow remain in alignment with traditional gender roles, including her practice as a ballerina and her portrayal as a victim of trauma.

Throughout her 20th-century appearances, Black Widow was primarily defined by the men around her. When she was a villain, Black Widow&#x27;s motivation was to honor her husband who had been presumed dead. This, along with her relationships with Iron Man and Hawkeye, meant that all of her actions were defined by the men in her life. This trend continued when she reformed as a superhero, an action she took because of her love for Hawkeye, and then in her relationship with Daredevil. This was part of a common theme in various media during the 1960s where &quot;femme fatale&quot; characters were redeemed through a romantic interest. From the 1970s through the 1990s, Black Widow suffered what was described as the &quot;widow&#x27;s curse&quot;, in which she was unable to maintain relationships with men because they kept dying. Her character&#x27;s publication was also dependent on male characters, as her departure as a co-star of &quot;Daredevil&quot; meant that he retained a standalone series but she did not.

Black Widow was heavily sexualized during her 1970 run in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;, with frequent depictions of her changing outfits or wearing lingerie. A recurring gag developed in which she changed in the backseat of her car while warning her driver &quot;eyes front, Ivan&quot;. She was one of many female action heroes to follow a trend in the 1970s where strong women were portrayed as traditionally attractive, as writers tried to appease both the target male demographic and the feminist movement. As part of the Black Widow program, Natasha&#x27;s body was modified to make her infertile and to give her a permanent hourglass figure. Her sexuality was emphasized more explicitly when she appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; and other series over the following decades, as characters routinely commented on her sexual attractiveness. Her sex appeal was featured prominently in the artwork for &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and she frequently wore revealing clothing when not in costume. Her role in the series also relegated her to being a damsel in distress.

==Supporting characters==

Black Widow was introduced as an enemy of Iron Man. Hawkeye was Black Widow&#x27;s ally and love interest in her 1960s appearances, working with him to fight Iron Man and then reforming so she can be with him in the United States. They inverted the traditional gender roles, with Black Widow having the power in their relationship while Hawkeye played the role of a dependent love interest. As they aligned with the Avengers, Black Widow was initially rebuffed due to her history as a Soviet spy. She worked with Angel, Ghost Rider, Hercules, and Iceman as part of the Champions. Black Widow and Hercules began a romance, but as an immortal he did not have interest in a long-term relationship with a mortal. Black Widow has also worked with Spider-Man, at one point expressing romantic interest in him in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #82–85 (1979).

Black Widow was fostered as a child by Ivan Petrovich, who supported her superhero career by acting as her chauffeur. He was initially portrayed as a father figure throughout her childhood, but newer accounts of Black Widow&#x27;s history place her in training under the Soviet government for much of this time. Other portrayals removed the father figure aspect and gave them a flirtatious relationship. Ivan accompanied her until he became a cyborg and went insane, forcing her to kill him. Black Widow was previously married to the Red Guardian through an arranged marriage. He was believed dead, and he later sacrificed himself to save her. Bucky Barnes was one of Natasha&#x27;s instructors in the Red Room while he was the Winter Soldier, and they were romantically involved while working together for the Soviet government. After the Secret Invasion, Black Widow worked alongside Bucky, who had taken the title of Captain America after the death of Steve Rogers. The two grew closer and began a new romance.

Many of Black Widow&#x27;s enemies, such as Damon Dran and Bullseye, come from her time working alongside Daredevil. She has come into conflict with the Hand several times throughout her life and was at one point killed by them before being revived. Black Widow finds a counterpart and rival in Yelena Belova, another Black Widow. Yelena&#x27;s relative youth causes Natasha to question her role as a Black Widow as she ages.

=== Daredevil ===

Black Widow became closely associated with Daredevil in the 1970s, first as a recurring character in his series in 1971 and then as a main character alongside him when they began a romantic relationship. She altered the dynamic of Daredevil&#x27;s character, who had previously had one specific love interest in Karen Page. Unlike Karen, Black Widow supported Daredevil&#x27;s superhero activity, complementing this aspect of his character and making him more confident.

Daredevil took a domineering role in their relationship, and the couple were sometimes physically abusive toward one another. It was ultimately detrimental to both characters&#x27; lives, with Black Widow growing dependent on Daredevil. Though Black Widow was written out of the series after leaving him in 1975, they got back together in 1978 until he left her for Heather Glenn in 1980. When this relationship became unhealthy, Daredevil&#x27;s friend Foggy Nelson enlisted Black Widow to break them up. After their romantic involvement, Black Widow and Daredevil remained friends and continued relying on each other as superheroes.

==Reception==
Black Widow was not well known in popular culture until she was adapted to film in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010). After her film appearances began, the character developed a strong fan base and became a focal point for calls of greater prominence of female comic book characters. Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described her as &quot;THE Avengers B-lister, full stop&quot;. Andrea Towers of &quot;Polygon&quot; cited Black Widow&#x27;s grounded values of empathy and loyalty as keeping the character relevant amid her inconsistent publication. Writer Gerry Conway cited his work with Black Widow as his inspiration when he created &quot;Cinder and Ashe&quot; for DC Comics.

Psychologist and popular culture writer Sherry Ginn praised Black Widow as a strong female role model, though other commentators have challenged this based on her history as a villain and depictions of the character as a damsel in distress. Portrayals of Black Widow have been criticized as sexist, as she has often worn revealing outfits and played a subservient role to male characters. This was especially true of Gerry Conway&#x27;s depiction of her in &quot;Daredevil&quot; before he updated her role and granted her more autonomy. Black Widow&#x27;s costume and design have been praised by comic writer Nathan Edmondson and Black Widow actress Scarlett Johansson, who describe it as empowering the character and giving her legitimacy as a superhero. This contrasts with her original costume from the 1960s, which Alan Kistler of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; described as &quot;a wee bit silly, even for the Silver Age of comics&quot;.

Several Black Widow stories have received critical praise. &quot;The Itsy-Bitsy Spider&quot; (1999) and &quot;Homecoming&quot; (2004–2005) were celebrated for their exploration of the spy thriller genre. Her &quot;Web of Intrigue&quot; (1983) appearances in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; and her &quot;Deadly Origin&quot; (2010) series received praise for their artwork, with the latter standing out for its contrasting art styles by Tom Raney and John Paul Leon in the flashback and present-day segments. The positive reception toward the &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; appearances have led to multiple republications in standalone volumes.

In 1975, Angie Bowie wished to make a film or television series starring herself as Black Widow. The idea came while she was having lunch with Stan Lee, and he sold her the film rights for one dollar. Bowie had costumes made and cast Ben Carruthers as Daredevil, but she was unable to get funding for the project and its production only went as far as test photography.

With the success of the animated television show &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; in the 1980s, a Black Widow show was considered as one of several possible follow ups. In 1996, a Black Widow television film was written by Mel Friedmen and Christopher Cosby for Fox Broadcasting Company. The script depicted Black Widow as a magazine publisher with a double-life as a crime-fighter, having her fight a crime syndicate called Octopus that killed her father. Marvel Studios and Lionsgate collaborated on a possible film adaptation written by David Hayter, but a series of poorly-performing action movies starring women in the mid-2000s caused Lionsgate to back out of the project.

A film adaptation of Black Widow appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Scarlett Johansson. She first appeared as a supporting character in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010) and reprised the role in &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012), &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), &quot;&quot; (2018), and &quot;&quot; (2019) before taking a leading role in &quot;Black Widow&quot; (2021). She was voiced by Lake Bell in &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021–2024).

Black Widow has been adapted in several video games and animated television series based on Marvel Comics properties. The character is frequently voiced by Laura Bailey, who has portrayed Black Widow in animated series such as &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot; (2013) and &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2017) as well as video games such as &quot;Lego Marvel Super Heroes&quot; (2013), &quot;Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order&quot; (2019), &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Avengers&quot; (2020), and &quot;Marvel Rivals&quot; (2024). Other voice actresses for Black Widow include Olivia d&#x27;Abo in the film &quot;Ultimate Avengers&quot; (2006), Lena Headey in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; (2009), and Vanessa Marshall in &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; (2010).

<text>A protection racket is a type of racket and a scheme of organized crime perpetrated by a potentially hazardous organized crime group that generally guarantees protection outside the sanction of the law to another entity or individual from violence, robbery, ransacking, arson, vandalism, and other such threats, in exchange for payments at regular intervals. Each payment is called &quot;protection money&quot; or a &quot;protection fee&quot;. An organized crime group determines an affordable or reasonable fee by negotiating with each of its payers, to ensure that each payer can pay the fee on a regular basis and on time. Protections rackets can vary in terms of their levels of sophistication or organization; it is not uncommon for their operations to emulate the structures or methods used by tax authorities within legitimate governments to collect taxes from taxpayers. 

The perpetrators of a protection racket may protect vulnerable targets from other dangerous individuals and groups or may simply offer to refrain from themselves carrying out attacks on the targets, and usually both of these forms of protection are implied in the racket. Due to the frequent implication that the racketeers may contribute to harming the target upon failure to pay, the protection racket is generally considered a form of extortion. In some instances, the main potential threat to the target may be caused by the same group that offers to solve it in return for payment, but that fact may sometimes be concealed in order to ensure continual patronage and funding of the crime syndicate by the coerced party. In other cases, depending on the perpetrators&#x27; level of influence with authorities and the legality of the business being protected, protection rackets may also offer protection against law enforcement and police involvement, especially if the perpetrators bribe or threaten local law enforcement.

The protection racket mostly sells physical security. Through the credible threat of violence, the racketeers deter both third-party criminals and people in their own criminal organization from swindling, robbing, injuring, sabotaging, or otherwise harming their clients. The racket often occurs in situations and places where criminal threats to certain businesses, entities, or individuals are not effectively prevented or addressed by the prevailing system of law and order or governance, or in cases of inadequate protection by the law for certain ethnic or socioeconomic groups. Protection rackets tend to form in markets in which the law enforcement cannot be counted on to provide legal protection, because of incompetence (as in weak, corrupt, or failed states), illegality (when the targeted entity is involved in black markets), and/or because forms of government distrust exist among the entities involved. Hence, protection rackets are common in places or territories where criminal organizations resemble de facto authorities, or parallel governments. Sicily, Italy is a great example of this phenomenon, where the Cosa Nostra collects protection money locally and resembles a de facto authority, or a parallel government. 

Protection rackets are often indistinguishable in practice from extortion rackets, and generally distinguishable from social service and private security by the degree of implied threat; the racketeers themselves may threaten and attack businesses, technological infrastructure, and citizens if the payments are not made. A distinction is possible between a &quot;pure&quot; extortion protection racket, in which the racketeers might agree only not to attack a business or entity, and a broader protection racket offering some real private security in addition to such extortion. In either case, the racketeers generally agree to defend a business or individual from &quot;any&quot; attack by either themselves or third parties (other criminal gangs). In reality, the distinction between the two types of protection rackets is dubious, because in either case extortion racketeers may have to defend their clients against rival gangs to maintain their profits. By corollary, criminal gangs may have to maintain control of territories (turfs), as local businesses may collapse if forced to pay for protection from too many rackets, which then hurts all parties involved.

Certain scholars, such as Diego Gambetta, classify criminal organizations engaged in protection racketeering as &quot;mafia&quot;, as the racket is popular with both the Sicilian Mafia and Italian-American Mafia.

==Overview==
A protection racket is an operation where racketeers provide protection to persons and properties, settle disputes and enforce contracts in markets where the police and judicial system cannot be relied upon.

Diego Gambetta&#x27;s &quot;The Sicilian Mafia&quot; (1996) and Federico Varese&#x27;s &quot;The Russian Mafia&quot; (2001) define the mafia as a type of organized crime group that specializes in the provision of private protection.

Protection racketeers or mafia groups operate mostly in the black market, providing buyers and sellers the security they need for smooth transactions; but empirical data collected by Gambetta and Varese suggests that mafia groups are able to offer private protection to corporations and individuals in legal markets when the state fails to offer sufficient and efficient protection to the people in need. Two elements distinguish racketeers from legal security firms. The first element is their willingness to deploy violent forms of retribution (going as far as murder) that fall outside the limits the law normally extends to civilian security firms. The other element is that racketeers are willing to involve themselves in illegal markets.

Recent studies show that mafia groups or gangs are not the only form of protection racket or extra-legal protector, and another important form of protection racket is corrupt networks consisting of public officials, especially those from criminal justice agencies. For example, Wang&#x27;s &quot;The Chinese Mafia&quot; (2017) examines protection rackets in China and suggests two types of extra-legal protectors, namely the Black Mafia (local gangs) and the Red Mafia (networks of corrupt government officials). Wang&#x27;s narrative suggests that local gangs are quasi-law enforcers in both legal and illegal markets, and corrupt public officials are extra-legal protectors, safeguarding local gangs, protecting illegal entrepreneurs in the criminal underworld, offering protection to businesspeople, and selling public appointments to buyers.

==Territorial monopolies==
A protection racketeer cannot tolerate competition within his sphere of influence from another racketeer. If a dispute erupted between two clients (e.g. businessmen competing for a construction contract) who are protected by rival racketeers, the two racketeers would have to fight each other to win the dispute for their respective clients. The outcomes of such fights can be unpredictable, and neither racketeer would be able to guarantee a victory for his client. This would make their protection unreliable and of little value; their clients would likely dismiss them and settle the dispute by other means. Therefore, racketeers negotiate territories in which they can monopolize the use of violence in settling disputes. These territories may be geographical, or they may be a certain type of business or form of transaction.

==Providing genuine protection==
Sometimes racketeers will warn other criminals that the client is under their protection and that they will punish anyone who harms the client. Services that the racketeers may offer may include the recovery of stolen property or punishing vandals. The racketeers may even advance the interests of the client by forcing out (or otherwise hindering or intimidating) unprotected competitors.

Protection from theft and vandalism is one service the racketeer may offer. For instance, in Sicily, mafiosi know all the thieves and fences in their territory, and can track down stolen goods and punish thieves who attack their clients.

Protection racketeers establish what they hope will be indefinitely long bonds with their clients. This allows the racketeers to publicly declare a client to be under their protection. Thus, thieves and other predators will have little confusion as to who is and is not protected.

Protection racketeers are not necessarily criminals. In &quot;A Short History of Progress&quot;, Ronald Wright notes on p. 49, &quot;The warrior caste, supposedly society&#x27;s protectors, often become protection racketeers. In times of war or crisis, power is easily stolen from the many by the few on a promise of security. The more elusive or imaginary the foe, the better for manufacturing consent.&quot;

==Examples==
*Danegeld, was a protection tax paid by Christendom to stop Viking raids.
*During the late medieval and early modern era in the Scottish Marches, local farmers would often need to make payments to the Border Reivers as a form of protection money to ensure they were not attacked. These agreements were called &quot;Black mal&quot;, where &quot;mal&quot; was an Old Norse word meaning agreement. The word blackmail entered the English language in 1530 as a result, but the word&#x27;s meaning has changed since.
*Many early Islamic empires levied a tax upon non-Muslims in return for protection and an exemption from compulsory military service. There is no record of the tax being imposed by a nation after the late 1800s.
*In Melbourne, Australia, Alphonse Gangitano ran a protection racket along the famous Lygon Street during the 1990s.
*In Sicily, Italy, officials say that 80% of businesses in the city of Palermo pay &quot;pizzo&quot;, or protection money, to the Sicilian Mafia.
*In Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, when the Mexican Drug War escalated in 2008, criminal groups like the Juárez Cartel saw their financial backbone threatened and began asking for protection money from businesses ranging from convenience stores to clubs and restaurants with the threat of burning down the business or shooting everyone inside with machine guns.
*In the early history of post-Soviet Russia, law enforcement was too underfunded and poorly trained to protect businesses and enforce contracts. Most businesses had to join a protection racket (known as a &quot;krysha&quot;, the Russian word for &quot;roof&quot;) run by local gangsters.
*In the United Kingdom in the 1950s and 60s the Kray twins ran protection rackets in the East End of London.
*Chauth, demanded by Sambhaji and Peshva Brahmins during Mahratta Invasions of Bengal and Mahratta Sackings of Goa and Bombay-Bassein.

==Government protection rackets==
Government officials may demand bribes to look the other way or extort something of value from citizens or corporations in the form of a kickback. It need not always be money. A lucrative job after leaving office may have been in exchange for protection offered when in office. Payment may also show up indirectly in the form of a campaign contribution. Stopping government agencies as a whole, and buying protection in the government is called regulatory capture.

<doc id="709360" wikidata="Q444882" url="?curid=709360" title="Modifications (genetics)">
<text>The term modifications in genetics refers to both naturally occurring and engineered changes in DNA.
Incidental, or natural mutations occur through errors during replication and repair, either spontaneously or due to environmental stressors. Intentional modifications are done in a laboratory for various purposes, developing hardier seeds and plants, and increasingly to treat human disease. The use of gene editing technology remains controversial.

==Genetic modifications (incidental and intentional) ==
Modifications are changes in an individual&#x27;s DNA due to incidental mutation or intentional genetic modification using various biotechnologies. Although confusion exists between the terms &quot;modification&quot; and &quot;mutation&quot; as they are often used interchangeably, modification differentiates itself from mutation because it acts as an umbrella term, encompassing both definitions of mutation and genetic engineering. Both of these subcategorizations result in a change affect an organism&#x27;s obervable characteristics, also known as their phenotype, caused due to alterations in an organism&#x27;s genotype, or their specific alleles, resulting in altered gene expression. Although heritability plays a large role in an individual&#x27;s expression, like in cases of epigenetic modifications, not all instances of modification are heritable. No matter the origins of such variation at the genetic level, it clearly impacts the creation and interaction of proteins, changing cell function, phenotype, and organism function.

=== Types of modification ===
Genetic modifications can occur naturally, through aforementioned mutations in an organism&#x27;s genome, or through biotechnological methods of selecting a gene of interest to manipulate in order to make something new or improve upon what already exists. This distinction between changes that occur naturally and those that are intentional is key to understanding the difference between mutation and genetic engineering.

==== Mutation (incidental) ====
Mutation can be more accurately defined as any non-combinatorial change in phenotype that is able to be consistently inherited from parent to offspring over generations. Mutations can be attributed to many factors and come in numerous different forms, however they can mostly be attributed to mistakes that occur during DNA replication or exposure to external factors. As cellular processes are highly efficient, they are not perfect causing disparities between organisms of the same species. These disparities can cause many different phenotypic effects of all intensities, ranging from no observable impact at all to possible inviability. Due to environmental conditions such as climate, diet, oxygen levels, light cycles, and mutagens or chemicals which are strongly related to disease susceptibility, genes expression can vary. The timing and duration of exposure to such elements is a critical factor as well as it can significantly impact the phenotypic response of an organism, generally increasing severity with time.

&quot;Methods:&quot;

There are several methods, or forms, of mutation that exist including spontaneous mutation, errors during replication and repair, as well as mutation due to environmental effects. These origins of mutations can cause many different types of mutations which influence gene expression on both large and small scales.

==== Genetic engineering (intentional) ====
Genetic engineering is a type of intentional genetic modification, which uses biotechnology to alter an organism&#x27;s genome. According to World Health Organization (WHO), genetically modified organisms are defined as &quot;Organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination”. This type of modification can involve insertions or deletions of DNA bases into the existing genetic code. In biotechnological methodology, a series of four steps are used in order to create a genetically modified organism (GMO).

## Identify
### Researchers identify a trait of interest usually based on a desire to solve a problem.
## Isolate
### Researchers the sequence of the specific trait by comparing genomes of organisms within the same species, with and without the trait.
## Insert
### Next, they utilize the sequence(s) and various enzymes to insert the trait&#x27;s genes into a plasmid vector, which can then be inserted into bacteria to propagate the preferable gene.
## Grow
### A sign of the creation of a successful GMO is growth and replication with the newly edited genome with no detriments to the organism due to the new modification.

&quot;Methods:&quot;
CRISPR methods are a popularly used type of the aforementioned process of genome editing. Standing for &#x27;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats&#x27;, CRISPR gene editing allows scientists to manually alter gene expression, correcting errors or creating new variations. Since 2012, scientists have worked to develop this technology which has the opportunity to both cure genetic diseases and genetically modify traits to be most desirable, purposefully altering DNA with a high degree of precision.

=== Examples ===

==== Mutation (incidental) ====
The dandelion: Most dandelions have long stems, but an increase in potential threats in their environment have caused average dandelion stem length to decrease within certain species, allowing them to better avoid said threats. This adaptation was possible due to a mutation occurring in a shorter-stemmed individual being selected by environmental pressures. Because the shorter-stemmed dandelions had higher fitness than long-stemmed dandelions and were able to survive more often, the genetic frequency of the population was altered, genetically modified through the original occurrence of a mutation.

Sickle cell disease: In a healthy individual, the HBB gene is responsible for encoding hemoglobin which carries oxygen throughout the body. However, when a person has this disease due to inheriting two mutated copies of the HBB gene due to a base pair point mutation, their red blood cells are shaped differently. This altered shape results in blockages of blood flow with serious health implications. On the other hand, those who inherit only one mutated copy of this gene have higher protection against malaria.

==== Genetic engineering (intentional) ====
Alzheimer&#x27;s disease: In a synthetic example in a laboratory, scientists isolated the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, known for using Alzheimer&#x27;s in humans, and transmitted it into the nerve cells of worms. In doing this, scientists aimed to study the progression of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in this simple organism by tagging the APP protein with green fluorescent protein which allowed them to better visualize the gene as the worm aged. Using what they learned from experimentation with the simple worm and the APP gene, scientists increased their understanding of this gene&#x27;s role in causing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in humans.

Insulin: The first use of genetically modified bacteria was for the medical insulin that diabetics need to medically control their blood sugar. Through the following steps, scientists are able to genetically engineer a medical product that millions of people rely on worldwide:

# A small piece of DNA is extracted from a circular form of bacterial or yeast DNA called a plasmid. A scientist will extract this DNA through using specific restriction enzymes.
# Then, a scientist will insert the human gene for insulin into the gap left by the extracted DNA. This plasmid is now considered a genetically modified entity.
# The genetically modified entity is reintroduced into a new bacterial or yeast cell.
# This cell will then undergo mitosis and divide rapidly, producing insulin suitable for human needs.
# Scientists grow the genetically modified bacteria or yeast in large fermentation vessels, which contain all of their necessary nutrients, and allow large amounts of insulin to be cultivated.
# When fermentation is complete, the mixture is filtered to produce the final the insulin.
# The insulin is then purified and packaged into bottles and insulin pens for distribution to patients with diabetes.

=== Ethics of genetic engineering ===
Fast-paced developments in the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has increased both the concerns and relevance of this ethical controversy as it has become more popularly used. The scientific community recommends continued evaluation of risks and benefits of utilizing genetically modified organisms in everyday life. Genetic modifications are studied by researchers under controlled conditions after they are inserted into an organism, allowing for improved scientific understanding of the effects of certain gene modifications and certain organism responses.

==== Humans ====
In April 2015, gene editing technology was used on human embryos and debate about the ethics of such actions persisted since. Nonetheless, scientists and policymakers are in agreement that public deliberations should decide the legality of germ line genome editing. Modifying a person&#x27;s non-heritable DNA with the goal of improving one&#x27;s medical condition is generally accepted and has a plethora of ethical protocols monitoring such procedures. This includes modifications like organ donation, bone marrow transplants, and types of gene therapies, all of which consider cultural and religious values. On the other hand, there is contention surrounding heritable gene modification exemplified by the fact that 19 countries have outlawed this type of genetic modification. For those who believe the vitility of a human embryo is equivalent to an adult, genome editing in early development occurring at or immediately following fertilization raises moral concerns. In order to mitigate these concerns, studies using human embryos have used embryos from left over IVF treatments. Scientists have also suggested creating fertilized zygotes from donated sperm and eggs strictly for research purposes. However, this raises an additional ethical concern within the scientific community about the concept of a zygote being created only to be used for experimentation.

==== Foods ====
Debate also surrounds genetically engineered food in terms of the controversial health and environmental effects that it may have in various time scales. Regulations have been implemented for approval of genetically modified foods to reduce some uncertainty that remains in this field. The reasons in favor of development of genetically modified foods include to meet the demands of the exponentially growing human population, to substitute for the decrease in farmable land, and to address the decrease in genetic diversity which limits possible improvement of species. Additional benefits include improved herbicide tolerance, increased pest and bacterial/fungal/viral resistance, higher stress tolerance, and increased nutrient content within the organism. The biotechnology of genetic engineering provides the opportunity to achieve global food security by addressing these problems and positively impacting the food production economy. Potential health risks are also being researched and there are requirements for the safety of genetically modified foods to be clarified before they are consumed by the public. Environmental consequences are also considered due to disruptions within the food web when these organisms are added to a previously balanced ecosystem. As genetic modification is so fast, the environment may not be able to adapt and integrate the new organism into the ecosystem or it could have unwanted effects on its surroundings. Other impacts on the environment include unnatural gene flow, modification of soil and water chemistry, and reduction of species diversity.

=== Future implications of modification ===
Ethical considerations regarding gene editing are largely controversial within the scientific community due to its open ended implications for the rest of society. Although no consensus has been reached, there are plans in place to utilize the available resources to continue education, scientific research as well as research on ethical, legal, and social issues associated with genetic modification.

<doc id="709367" wikidata="Q3005747" url="?curid=709367" title="Mod n cryptanalysis">
<text>In cryptography, mod cryptanalysis is an attack applicable to block and stream ciphers. It is a form of partitioning cryptanalysis that exploits unevenness in how the cipher operates over equivalence classes (congruence classes) modulo. The method was first suggested in 1999 by John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and David Wagner and applied to RC5P (a variant of RC5) and M6 (a family of block ciphers used in the FireWire standard). These attacks used the properties of binary addition and bit rotation modulo a Fermat prime.

==Mod 3 analysis of RC5P==
For RC5P, analysis was conducted modulo 3. It was observed that the operations in the cipher (rotation and addition, both on 32-bit words) were somewhat biased over congruence classes mod 3. To illustrate the approach, consider left rotation by a single bit:

: formula_1

Then, because

: formula_2

it follows that

: formula_3

Thus left rotation by a single bit has a simple description modulo 3. Analysis of other operations (data dependent rotation and modular addition) reveals similar, notable biases. Although there are some theoretical problems analysing the operations in combination, the bias can be detected experimentally for the entire cipher. In (Kelsey et al., 1999), experiments were conducted up to seven rounds, and based on this they conjecture that as many as 19 or 20 rounds of RC5P can be distinguished from random using this attack. There is also a corresponding method for recovering the secret key.

Against M6 there are attacks mod 5 and mod 257 that are even more effective.

<text>The Story of the Weeping Camel (, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Tears of the Camel&quot;) is a 2003 German docudrama distributed by ThinkFilm. It was released internationally in 2004. The film was directed and written by Byambasuren Davaa and Luigi Falorni. The plot is about a family of nomadic shepherds in the Gobi Desert trying to save the life of a rare white bactrian camel (&quot;Camelus bactrianus&quot;) after it was rejected by its mother.

==Plot==
During Spring, a family of nomadic shepherds assists the births of their camel herd. The last camel to calve this season has a protracted labor that persists for two days. With the assistance and intervention of the family, a rare white calf is born. This is the mother camel&#x27;s first calving. Despite the efforts of the shepherds, the mother rejects the newborn, refusing it her milk and failing to establish a care-bond with it.

To restore harmony between the mother and calf, the nomadic family call upon the services of a group of lamas who perform a ritual with bread or dough &#x27;effigies&#x27; () of the mother, the calf and the individual members of the family. The rite opens with the sound of a sacred horn followed by bells in the hands of lamas, some of whom wield &quot;vajra&quot;. The rite takes place with members of the extended nomadic community and a number of lama at a sacred place that consists of one end of a log, or wooden pole, set in the earth, with the other end raised to the sky: a stylized &#x27;victory banner&#x27; () with a piece of blue fabric entwined around it, functioning as a prayer flag (darchor-style). The log is supported by a cairn of rocks at its base as foundation. The ritual, however, does not re-establish harmony between the mother and calf.

The family then resolves to secure the services of an indigenous &#x27;violinist&#x27; to play the music for a Mongolian &#x27;Hoos&#x27; ritual. They send their two young boys on a journey through the desert to the district center to locate a musician. The &#x27;violinist&#x27; — who actually plays a morin khuur — is summoned to the camp and a ritual of folk music and chanting is enacted. The musician first drapes the morin khuur on the first hump of the camel to establish a sympathetic magical linkage between the mother and the state of harmony represented by the instrument. Once this is done he removes the instrument and commences playing. As the musician sounds the Morin Khuur, the female family member who lulled her child to sleep with a lullaby earlier in the documentary, repeatedly intones the calming sounds and beautiful melody of the &#x27;hoos&#x27;. At this point, the mother camel starts to weep, tears visibly streaming from her eyes. Immediately after the rite the mother and calf are reconciled and the calf draws milk from her teat.

==Reception==
&quot;The Story of the Weeping Camel&quot; received generally positive reviews; on Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% &#x27;fresh&#x27; rating, based on 103 reviews, and an average rating of 7.57/10, with the consensus &quot;Delightful and strangely moving&quot;; on Metacritic, which uses an average of all 30 critics&#x27; reviews, the film has an 81/100, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
The documentary was nominated for an Oscar in the category Best Documentary at the 77th Academy Awards.

<text>Lars Ramkilde Knudsen (born 21 February 1962) is a Danish researcher in cryptography, particularly interested in the design and analysis of block ciphers, hash functions and message authentication codes (MACs).

==Academic==
After some early work in banking, Knudsen enrolled at Aarhus University in 1984 studying mathematics and computer science, gaining an MSc in 1992 and a PhD in 1994. From 1997-2001, he worked at the University of Bergen, Norway. Currently, Knudsen is a professor in the Department of Mathematics at the Technical University of Denmark. Ivan Damgård was Lars&#x27; mentor during his studies at Aarhus University. His Ph.D. was refereed by Bart Preneel.

==Publications==
Knudsen has published a couple of papers on cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives, including the R-MAC scheme, the SHA-1 and MD2 hash functions, and a couple of block ciphers: DES, DFC, IDEA, ICE, LOKI, MISTY, RC2, RC5, RC6, SC2000, Skipjack, Square and SAFER.

Knudsen was involved in designing some ciphers: AES candidates DEAL and Serpent (the latter in conjunction with Ross Anderson and Eli Biham). He was involved in designing Grøstl, a hash function which was one of the submissions to the NIST SHA-3 competition (it was not the winner).

He introduced the technique of impossible differential cryptanalysis and integral cryptanalysis.

<text>The Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB; often referred to as the Housing Board), is a statutory board under the Ministry of National Development responsible for the public housing in Singapore. Established in 1960 as a result of efforts in the late 1950s to set up an authority to take over the Singapore Improvement Trust&#x27;s (SIT) public housing responsibilities, the HDB focused on the construction of emergency housing and the resettlement of kampong residents into public housing in the first few years of its existence. 

This focus shifted from the late 1960s, with the HDB building flats with improved fittings and offering them for sale. From the 1970s, it initiated efforts to improve community cohesion in its estates and solicit resident feedback. In the 1990s and 2000s, the HDB introduced upgrading and redevelopment schemes for mature estates, as well as new types of housing intended to cater to different income groups in partnership with private developers. The HDB was reorganised in 2003 to better suit Singapore&#x27;s housing market in the 2000s. Efforts to engage residents with upgrading schemes increased in the 2000s and 2010s, and the HDB also began solar panel installation works from the early 2010s.

The HDB consists of a 12-member board and three departments, the Building, Estate and Corporate departments. Besides the provision of public housing, the HDB handles land reclamation works in Singapore and maintains the infrastructure of Singapore&#x27;s national resource stockpiles.

The HDB is also a major purchaser of state land from the Government with the purchase price payable by HDB going into the past reserves.

==History==
===Background and formation===
By the 1940s and 1950s, Singapore experienced rapid population growth, with the population increasing to 1.7 million from 940,700 between 1947 and 1957. The living conditions of people in Singapore worsened, with many people living in informal settlements or cramped shophouses. Moreover, the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT), which was then responsible for public housing in Singapore, faced many problems in providing public housing, with the rents for flats being too low to be financially sustainable but unaffordable for many of the poorer people in Singapore. Delays in approval for new housing developments greatly slowed housing construction by 1958.

In the mid-1950s, in light of the findings of the Committee on Local Government, the government initiated efforts to set up a new housing authority in place of the SIT. These efforts culminated in the Housing and Development Bill, which was read to the Legislative Assembly in 1958 and passed the next year. With the bill&#x27;s passing, the HDB was formed in February 1960, taking over the SIT&#x27;s public housing responsibilities.

===The 1960s to 1980s=== 

On the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB)&#x27;s formation, it announced plans to build over 50,000 flats, mostly in the city, under a five-year scheme, and found ways to build flats as cheaply as possible so that the poor could afford to stay in them. The HDB also continued the SIT&#x27;s efforts in building emergency flats in Tiong Bahru, which were mostly used to rehouse people displaced by the Bukit Ho Swee fire in May 1961. After the fire, the HDB focused its efforts on Bukit Ho Swee&#x27;s redevelopment, rapidly designing and constructing a public housing estate on the fire&#x27;s site, with people displaced by urban renewal projects and kampong fires rehoused in the estate&#x27;s flats. Their occupants disliked the one-room emergency flats, so by the mid-1960s, the HDB had moved on to building larger flats, especially around the Central Area. Nevertheless, the Bukit Ho Swee estate marked the beginning of the HDB&#x27;s resettlement efforts, and kampong dwellers were swiftly rehoused in public housing. By 1965, 54,430 flats had been built, with an increasing proportion of the population living in HDB dwellings.

The rehousing of kampong dwellers allowed the HDB to pursue its redevelopment plans for the Central Area, and the Urban Renewal Department was formed within the HDB in 1966 to manage the redevelopment works. This department also handled the construction of new amenities in the Central Area and collaborated with private enterprises in constructing new buildings on cleared sites. However, by the 1970s, the urban renewal projects proved too large for the department to handle alone, so the Urban Redevelopment Authority, a statutory board, replaced the department in 1974.

With the construction of the Bukit Ho Swee estate, the HDB also sought to change how estate residents behaved, and to give the state greater control over their lives. Moreover, with the new housing estates not segregated by race, the HDB facilitated the formation of multiracial communities in place of racially divided ones. Nevertheless, by the 1980s, racial divisions within HDB estates became increasingly pronounced, so to mitigate possible ethnic tensions, the Ethnic Integration Policy, which capped the racial proportions of residents in HDB estates, was introduced in 1989.

The HDB began offering flats for purchase in 1964, but as many flat dwellers at the time could not afford to do so, it was initially not very successful. Applicants could use their Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions to pay for their flats beginning in 1968. The take-up rate for flat purchases increased such that by the 1980s, most flat applicants were opting to purchase them. From the late 1960s onwards, the HDB designed flats and estates with improved amenities and fittings to improve the quality of life. To further these efforts, in the 1970s and 1980s, the HDB introduced residents committees in its housing estates to promote community cohesion, loosened regulations on flat modifications, and engaged in upgrading works. These works included the expansion of old one-room flats and the construction of new amenities in older estates. In addition, the HDB started soliciting feedback from residents through the Sample Household Surveys (SHS) from 1975.

In 1982, control over the Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) was transferred to the HDB. With the prices of HUDC flats approaching those of private housing, and the middle class being able to purchase HDB flats, the HDB stopped building HUDC flats in 1985.

===1990s to present===
In a bid to encourage younger people to continue living in older public housing estates, the HDB announced a large-scale upgrading scheme for those estates in 1989. Known as the Main Upgrading Programme, it attempted to improve these estates by adding new facilities to these estates, improved fittings in flats and varying the looks of the housing blocks in different precincts. In addition, the HDB initiated a redevelopment programme, the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) in 1995, in which selected housing blocks were razed and their residents compensated. SERS carried out renewal schemes in town centres in several older estates in the late 1990s. There have been a total of 81 SERS sites as of 2018.

Along with the upgrading schemes, the HDB introduced several new housing schemes in the 1990s. These included the Design and Build and Design Plus schemes, with flats designed in collaboration with private architects and built to a higher standard than other flats, and executive condominiums, with amenities similar to private housing. Further schemes were introduced in the 2000s, such as Build-to-Order, in which construction of flats began only after applicants had applied for them, and the Design, Build and Sell Scheme, in which the flats were developed and sold by private developers.

Nevertheless, the HDB was unable to adapt to the changes in Singapore&#x27;s housing market fast enough in the early 2000s. To determine and redefine its position in the housing market, the HDB was reorganised, transferring the provision of flat loans to private banks, and corporatising its Building and Development Division to form a new subsidiary, HDB Corp.

The HDB increased efforts to engage residents in its provision of public housing in the 2000s. These efforts included public consultation schemes and the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, in which facilities within multiple adjacent precincts were improved or upgraded, and residents were able to provide feedback on the planned improvements. Efforts to foster more extensive resident participation were made in 2013 with the Building Our Neighbourhood Dreams! project, in which residents could propose neighbourhood improvements instead of just providing feedback, but the initial projects were not well received.

The HDB began installation of solar panels on public housing blocks and in its properties in the 2010s. In 2014, together with the Economic Development Board, it initiated the SolarNova programme to handle solar panel installation on government properties and buildings.

==Responsibilities==
Under the Housing and Development Act, the HDB is tasked to plan and carry out the construction or upgrading of any building, clear slums, manage and maintain the estates and buildings that it owns, and to provide loans to people to buy land or public housing. The HDB also carries out land reclamation works and handles the infrastructure for Singapore&#x27;s national resource stockpiles.

==Organisation==
The HDB consists of a chairman and 11 other members, along with three departments, the Building, Estate and Corporate departments, under the purview of a chief executive officer, who is a member of the board. Each department is further subdivided into different groups. The Research and Planning, Development and Procurement, Building Quality and Building and Infrastructure groups and the Building and Research Institute are under the Building department; the Estate Administration and Property, Housing Management, Community Relations and Properties and Land groups under the Estate department; and the Corporate Development, Corporate Communications, Finance, Information Services and Legal groups under the Corporate department.

The HDB also controls 75% of EM Services, a company handling the upkeep of the HDB&#x27;s housing estates and properties, and the properties of other public organisations. HDB employees are organised under a house union, the HDB Staff Union (HDBSU).

<doc id="709387" wikidata="Q508046" url="?curid=709387" title="House of Broglie">
<text>The House of Broglie (, ; , ) is a distinguished French noble family, originally Piedmontese, who migrated to France in the year 1643. Members of this family bore the title of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, granted to them in 1759 by Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor.

== History ==

 () was the name of an old Piedmontese noble family, from which were descended the counts of Casalborgone, Mombello and Revello, and the lords of Arignano, Cortandone, Fontanetto Po, Chieri, Cocconato, Monale, Montaldo, Pont Canavese and Santena. The first reference to the name is dated 1245, mentioning one &quot;Ardizzone Broglia&quot;, father of &quot;Guglielmo&quot;, &quot;decurione&quot; of Chieri.

The founder of the French &quot;de Broglie&quot; line was Francesco Maria, count of Revello, of the &quot;Broglia di Chieri&quot; family. Born in 1611 in Piedmont, he took service in the French army in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and was naturalized in France after 1643. He is now known as François-Marie, comte de Broglie. After distinguishing himself as a soldier, he died, a lieutenant-general, at the siege of Valenza on 2 July 1656.

His son, Victor-Maurice, comte de Broglie (1647–1727), served under Condé, Turenne and other great commanders of the age of Louis XIV. He became &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1676, lieutenant-general in 1688, and finally marshal of France in 1724.

His grandson, François-Marie, was made duc de Broglie and a peer of France in 1742. His great-grandson, Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie, was created Prince of the Holy Roman Empire in 1759 by Emperor Francis I.

All junior members of the House of Broglie bear the title of &quot;prince de Broglie&quot;, while the head of the family is the &quot;duc de Broglie&quot;. A junior line used the title of &quot;prince de Broglie-Revel&quot;, after one of its lordships.

Louis, 7th duc de Broglie (1892–1987), a physicist and Nobel laureate, was one of the founders of quantum theory.

<doc id="709388" wikidata="Q535823" url="?curid=709388" title="Gottschalk (Obotrite prince)">
<text>Gottschalk, sometimes rendered as Godescalc (; died 7 June 1066), was a prince of the Obotrite confederacy from 1043 to 1066. He established a Polabian Slavic kingdom on the Elbe (in the area of present-day northeastern Germany) in the mid-11th century. His object in life seems to have been to collect the scattered tribes of the Slavs into one kingdom, and to make that kingdom Christian.

&quot;A pious and god-fearing man&quot;, Gottschalk effected the Christianisation of the Slavic tribes of the Elbe. He organised missions of German priests and founded monasteries at Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, Ratzeburg, Lübeck, and Lenzen, erecting the first three into dioceses. He himself often accompanied the missionaries on their work and augmented their message with his own explanations and instructions. In all this, he was supported by the efforts of Adalbert, Archbishop of Hamburg. However, the Obotrite nobility and peasantry largely remained pagan.

==Life==
Gottschalk&#x27;s father Udo was a bad Christian (&quot;male christianus&quot; according to Adam of Bremen) whose own father, Mistiwoi, had renounced the new religion for the old Slavic paganism. Udo sent his son to be educated at the monastery of St. Michael at Lenzen and later at Lüneburg. After a Saxon murdered Udo in 1028, Gottschalk renounced Christianity and took over the leadership of the Liutizi to avenge his father. He killed many Saxons before Duke Bernard II of Saxony defeated and captured him; his lands went to Ratibor of the Polabians. 

Re-converted to Christianity, Gottschalk was released and sent to Denmark with many of his people to serve King Canute the Great in his wars with Norway. He was sent to England with Canute&#x27;s son Sweyn. 

Sven Estridson, Jarl of Denmark, desired independence from King Magnus I of Norway in 1042. Because Magnus was supported by his brother-in-law, Bernard II, Sven achieved an alliance with the Obotrites through the mediation of Gottschalk. However, the Obotrite chief Ratibor was killed in a siege by Magnus in 1043. The death of Ratibor and his sons allowed Gottschalk, who married Sven&#x27;s daughter Sigrid, to seek the inheritance of his father Udo as Prince of the Obodrites. During the so-called Liutizi Civil War (&quot;Lutizischer Bruderkrieg&quot;) of 1057, Gottschalk conquered the Circipani and Kessini. He secured the territory through the building of new fortresses; the old fortifications of the conquered tribes were removed. He subdued the Liutizi and the diocese of Bremen &quot;feared him as king&quot; and paid him tribute. He nurtured alliance with his Christian neighbours, Scandinavian and German and joined in an alliance with Duke Bernard and King Magnus to defeat the Liutizi in battle.

Allied with the Lutici, the Obotrites murdered Gottschalk in a 1066 rebellion, capturing the castle of Lenzen and forcing his sons Henry and Budivoj to flee to Denmark and to Lüneburg respectively. Initially the Lutici-Obotrie alliance was led by Blus, but after his death in 1066, Kruto, whose power-base was Wagria, replaced him. Budivoj campaigned against Kruto with Saxon assistance, but was killed at Plön in 1075. Henry succeeded in avenging his father&#x27;s death by killing Kruto at a feast in 1090.

Gottschalk&#x27;s feast is the day of his death, according to the Carthusians of Brussels in the &quot;Martyrology of Usuardus&quot;. The primary sources for his life are Adam of Bremen and Helmold. &quot;Had he lived, he would have brought all pagans to the Christian faith.&quot; His son Henry later championed the missionary work of Vicelinus.

<doc id="709389" wikidata="Q330165" url="?curid=709389" title="Howard Metzenbaum">
<text>Howard Morton Metzenbaum (June 4, 1917March 12, 2008) was an American politician and businessman who served for almost 20 years as a Democratic member of the U.S. Senate from Ohio (1974, 1976–1995). He also served in the Ohio House of Representatives and Senate from 1943 to 1951.

==Early life and education==
Metzenbaum was born June 4, 1917, in Cleveland, Ohio, to a poor family, the son of Anna (née Klafter) and Charles I. Metzenbaum. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland and France, and his maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jews. He attended Glenville High School, where he ran track, while also working odd jobs after hours. He graduated from Ohio State University, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1939 and a law degree in 1941. During the 1940s, he practiced law in Cleveland. After initially facing discrimination due to his Jewish heritage, he found acceptance representing large labor unions, first with the Communications Workers of America and later the International Association of Machinists.

==Business career==
Metzenbaum became independently wealthy through investments, particularly in real estate near what became the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, which Metzenbaum and his partner, Alva &quot;Ted&quot; Bonda, correctly envisioned would make for extremely profitable, 24-hour, well-lit parking lots. The business expanded to become Airport Parking Company of America (APCOA), the world&#x27;s largest parking lot company. By 1970, he had sold his interest in APCOA Parking for US$20 million.

In the early 1970s, Metzenbaum also co-owned the &quot;Sun Newspapers&quot; chain of weeklies which covered the Cleveland suburbs, a venture undertaken after his first senatorial election defeat.

==Political career==

===Ohio legislature===
Metzenbaum served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1943 to 1947. He then served in the Ohio Senate from 1947 to 1951.

In 1958, he served as the campaign manager for future U.S. Senator Stephen M. Young, who, in a major upset, narrowly unseated incumbent Senator John Bricker, the Republican Party&#x27;s 1944 vice presidential nominee. He returned to assist Young in his successful reelection campaign in 1964.

===U.S. Senate===

In 1970, Metzenbaum ran for the Senate seat vacated by Young, who chose not to run for a third term. He beat astronaut John Glenn in the Democratic primary by a close 46%-45% margin, but narrowly lost to Robert Taft Jr. in the general election.

In 1974, when Senator William B. Saxbe (R-OH) resigned from his seat to accept the nomination as U.S. attorney general, Governor John J. Gilligan appointed Metzenbaum to serve the remainder of Saxbe&#x27;s term. Metzenbaum ran for election to the seat, but in a bitter Democratic primary, lost to Glenn, who subsequently won the general election by a landslide. In the primary, Metzenbaum contrasted his strong business background with Glenn&#x27;s military and astronaut credentials, saying his opponent had &quot;never worked for a living.&quot; John Glenn had served in the Marine Corps for 23 years. Glenn&#x27;s reply came to be known as the &quot;Gold Star Mothers&quot; speech. He told Metzenbaum to go to a veterans&#x27; hospital and &quot;look those men with mangled bodies in the eyes and tell them they didn&#x27;t hold a job. You go with me to any Gold Star mother and you look her in the eye and tell her that her son did not hold a job&quot;. Many felt the &quot;Gold Star Mothers&quot; speech won the primary for Glenn, which he won by 54% to 46%.

In 1976, Metzenbaum sought a rematch against Taft. The race was close again, but this time he won, riding on Jimmy Carter&#x27;s coattails. Taft resigned the seat a few days before his term ended, allowing Metzenbaum to be sworn in a few days early and hence have a small edge in seniority over other senators newly elected in 1976. He was reelected in 1982, comfortably defeating Republican state Senator Paul Pfeifer. That same year, Metzenbaum&#x27;s cousin, Harriett Woods, ran against Metzenbaum&#x27;s Republican colleague, John Danforth, for Danforth&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat in Missouri. Danforth defeated Woods by a margin of less than two percentage points.

In 1981 Metzenbaum was insulted on the floor of the Senate when Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina called him the &quot;senator from B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&quot;. Some interpreted this as a slur on Metzenbaum&#x27;s Jewish faith. Hollings later apologized to Metzenbaum and the remarks were stricken from the record.

On December 2, 1981, Metzenbaum was one of four senators to vote against an amendment to President Reagan&#x27;s MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Glenn and Metzenbaum had strained relations. There was a thaw in 1983 when Metzenbaum endorsed Glenn for president.

In 1988 Metzenbaum was opposed by Cleveland mayor George Voinovich. Voinovich accused Metzenbaum of being soft on child pornography. Voinovich&#x27;s charges were criticized by many, including Glenn, who recorded a statement for television refuting Voinovich&#x27;s charges. Metzenbaum won the election by 57% to 43%, even as George H. W. Bush won Ohio&#x27;s electoral votes by roughly 11 percentage points. Ten years later, Voinovich was elected to Glenn&#x27;s U.S. Senate seat after Glenn&#x27;s retirement.

===Issues===
Metzenbaum did not run for reelection in 1994. His son-in-law Joel Hyatt was nominated by the Democrats to replace him, but Hyatt lost to Lieutenant Governor Mike DeWine, who had been elected as Voinovich&#x27;s running mate in 1990.

While in the Senate, Metzenbaum was a powerful liberal. He was known as &quot;Senator No&quot; (a nickname shared by Republican Jesse Helms of North Carolina) and &quot;Headline Howard&quot; and a &quot;headline hog&quot; due to his ability to filibuster bills by offering scores of amendments as well as blocking hidden special-interest legislation. Metzenbaum took a particular interest in antitrust and consumer protection issues, often threatening to repeal the antitrust law exemption given to Major League Baseball. Since his retirement, the issue has gone largely unaddressed. Metzenbaum became well known for his service on the Senate Judiciary Committee, particularly because of his efforts to keep stringent antitrust laws and his pro-choice stance on abortion.

Metzenbaum was skeptical of corporations and agencies promoting aspartame. An allegation was that the G. D. Searle &amp; Company was trying to bring aspartame to market and get it approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by submitting false data. Metzenbaum berated Searle&#x27;s fabricated tests and also faulted the American Medical Association (AMA), whose &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (JAMA) reported, with some significant disclaimers, that aspartame was safe for most people. Of the report, Metzenbaum said, &quot;I wish that this [JAMA] report could ease my concerns. It does not. It merely restates the FDA position, which relies solely on the Searle tests. As I have indicated these tests are under a cloud. In addition, the concerns raised recently by the scientists...were not even included in the report.&quot; In 1985, the U.S. Senate heard testimony relating to an amendment by Metzenbaum that would require the quantity of aspartame in a product to be labeled.

==Cleveland Stokers==
In January 1968 Metzenbaum and Bonda purchased the Cleveland Stokers soccer club from Cleveland Indians executives Vernon Stouffer and Gabe Paul. Under their leadership, the team played one year in the North American Soccer League, and even won their division, before departing the league due to differences in business philosophy with the other owners.

==Retirement==
After leaving the Senate in 1995, Metzenbaum served as the chairman of the Consumer Federation of America. He died at his home in Aventura, Florida on March 12, 2008. He was buried at Mayfield Cemetery in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

Denying urban legends to the contrary, Metzenbaum said he was never affiliated with the Communist Party. When the National Republican Senatorial Committee suggested in 1987 that he had &quot;Communist sympathies&quot;, Chairman Rudy Boschwitz apologized for the smear.

Metzenbaum&#x27;s cousin James Metzenbaum was an Ohio attorney who wrote a text on zoning law and once ran for a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court.

==Personal life==

Metzenbaum married Shirley Louise Turoff (1923–2019) on 8 August 1946. They had four daughters : Barbara, Susan, Shelley, and Amy. Susan married Joel Hyatt.

==Legacy==

Metzenbaum was behind several pieces of enacted legislation during his senatorial career. These included the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which required warning periods for large factory closures; the Brady Law, which established a waiting period for handgun purchases; and the Howard M. Metzenbaum Multiethnic Placement Act of 1994 (MEPA) (U.S. Public Law 103-82), which prohibits federally subsidized adoption agencies from delaying or denying child placement on grounds of race or ethnicity.

On May 27, 1998, the Old Federal Building and Post Office in downtown Cleveland was renamed the Howard M. Metzenbaum United States Courthouse in his honor.

==In popular culture==
* Metzenbaum was referenced in the &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;Switcheroo&quot;. &quot;Space Ghost&quot; mentioned him as a guest whom his staff had forgotten to book.
* Metzenbaum had a cameo in the 1993 film &quot;Dave&quot;.

<text>Around the World in 80 Days is a 2004 action adventure comedy film directed by Frank Coraci from a script by David N. Titcher, David Benullo and David Goldstein. It is loosely based on Jules Verne&#x27;s 1873 novel of the same name, and for comedic reasons, intentionally deviated wildly from the novel and included a number of anachronistic elements. It stars Jackie Chan, Steve Coogan, Cécile de France and Jim Broadbent, with Ewen Bremner, Ian McNeice, Karen Joy Morris, Roger Hammond and David Ryall in supporting roles.

&quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on 13 June 2004 and was released theatrically in the United States on 16 June 2004, the United Kingdom and Ireland on 9 July and Germany on 23 December. The film received mixed reviews from critics and earned $72.6 million worldwide on a $110 million budget, making it a box-office bomb.

==Plot==
Lau Xing, a Chinese thief, robs the Bank of England and hides in Phileas Fogg&#x27;s garden, where he meets Fogg and gives his name as &quot;Passepartout&quot;. Though suspicious at first, Fogg hires him as his valet. He helps Fogg test his latest invention which breaks the speed barrier.

At the Royal Academy of Science, Fogg is insulted by Lord Kelvin, head of the academy, who believes ambition and innovation to be an insult. Following a debate on the whereabouts of the thief, Kelvin makes a bet that Fogg cannot travel around the world in 80 days. If Fogg succeeds, he will replace Kelvin as Minister of Science. If not, he will be ruined. Fogg and Passepartout take a carriage out of London after a confrontation with corrupt Inspector Fix, hired by Kelvin.

Passepartout and Fogg journey to Paris, where Passepartout must evade General Fang&#x27;s warriors. Fang wants the jade Buddha previously given to Lord Kelvin but stolen by Passepartout. Pretending to take Fogg to see Thomas Edison, Passepartout leads him to impressionist painting student Monique La Roche. Passepartout fights the warriors while his boss discusses impressionism. The two men and Monique depart in a hot-air balloon, chased by Fang&#x27;s warriors.

The trio continues their journey by train. However, in Istanbul, they are forced to become guests of Prince Hapi&#x27;s banquet. Whilst initially hospitable, he soon orders the men to leave while Monique must become his seventh wife. The men convince Hapi to release Monique or they will damage his personal statue of &quot;The Thinker&quot;, which is accidentally smashed. With Hapi in pursuit, the three travelers then escape.

Kelvin learns about the bank robbery. He orders the British colonial authorities in India to arrest both men. Passepartout sees notice of the price on his head and warns his companions. Disguised as women they are attacked by Fang&#x27;s warriors. Using Inspector Fix and a sextant as weapons, Fogg and Passepartout defeat their assailants and flee to China.

In a Chinese village where Lau Xing had come from, Lanzhou, they are welcomed by Lau&#x27;s family members. However, they are captured by the Black Scorpions. Recognized, Lau Xing challenges the leader of the group to a fight. At first, he fights alone and is defeated; moments later, he is joined by his fellow &quot;Ten Tigers of Canton&quot; to defeat the Black Scorpions. The jade Buddha is returned to the village temple.

Fogg desires to continue alone, disappointed and feeling used by his companions after finding out that through a picture of Lau and his family members in the village. He travels to San Francisco and is tricked out of his money. He is found destitute by Lau Xing and Monique who have followed him. In the Western desert, they find the Wright brothers who discuss their prototype flying machine. Fogg suggests a few changes, which are eagerly taken.

In New York City, a jubilant crowd prevents them from their ship. A policeman leads them to an ambush in a workshop. The three friends fight Fang and her warriors and win. Though Fogg could have gotten to the boat, he misses it to help Lau Xing. Fogg feels that he has lost, but the other two say that they may still make it if they catch the next ship.

They board an old ship and Fogg builds a plane out of the ship&#x27;s old wood, promising a new ship to the captain. The ship&#x27;s crew builds a catapult to launch it. The three fly to London and crash-land at the Royal Academy. Kelvin sends police to hinder them, and the clock strikes noon, ending the wager.

Kelvin proclaims himself the victor, but Monique, Fix and other ministers protest against his abuse and unfair methods. Kelvin insults Queen Victoria who overhears him and learns of his actions, which leads to his arrest. She then reveals that she has bet money on Fogg winning and that he has arrived a day early. Although the trio are confused at first, Fogg realizes that they forgot to take the time zones into account: because they traveled east, they subtracted one hour for each time zone. Therefore, in London, it’s still day 79, and Fogg won. He ascends the stairs of the academy and kisses Monique.

==Production==

Warner Bros., which owned the rights to the 1956 adaptation, planned its own remake with Stephen Sommers directing and Brendan Fraser starring, after the success of &quot;The Mummy&quot;. Stan Chervin wrote the script for this utilization of the film. Around the same time, 20th Century Fox and Good Machine were developing their own version with Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner writing the screenplay. Ang Lee and Stephen Herek were considered to direct.

When Frank Coraci got involved, he went back to read the original novel and watch the 1956 film, where he realized that the story didn&#x27;t really have a driving lead character. So he decided to rework the plot considerably, which involved giving Phileas Fogg an arc. Coraci&#x27;s first choice for Fogg was Johnny Depp, but studio executives at the time didn&#x27;t think Depp in a family movie would ever work. Jackie Chan was announced to play Passepartout in June 2002. He was paid about $18 million for the role. After Chan was cast, the filmmakers settled on lesser known character actor Steve Coogan for Fogg. Walden Media was in charge of investing the film while Summit Entertainment handled foreign sales. Paramount Pictures acquired domestic distribution rights, and set a release date for 21 November 2003. However, the studio stepped out at the start of the year, with concerns over the high budget and bankability of the cast.

Principal photography began on 13 March 2003 in Thailand, followed by a three month shoot at Babelsberg Studio in Berlin. Before Disney had picked up the film for North American distribution, it was one of the highest-budget films produced without a distributor attached.

==Release==

&quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California on 13 June 2004, and was released in the United States on 16 June 2004, by Walt Disney Pictures. Summit Entertainment handled international sales of the film. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Entertainment Film Distributors released the film on 9 July. On 23 December, Universum Film and Buena Vista International released it in Germany.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and VHS in the United States on 2 November 2004 by Walt Disney Home Entertainment.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 32% approval rating, based on 128 reviews, with an average score of 4.79/10, with the site&#x27;s consensus stating: &quot;Hit-and-miss family fare that bears only the slightest resemblance to Verne&#x27;s novel.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted score of 49 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Rob Mackie criticized it for having little to no resemblance to the novel it is based on. Roger Ebert praised it for its visual style and for being &quot;goofy fun&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Takes plenty of liberties with the material and never generates much genuine excitement, but provides an agreeable ride without overloading it with contemporary filmmaking mannerisms.&quot;

In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for two Razzie Awards - Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Supporting Actor (Arnold Schwarzenegger).

<text>Sedum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae, members of which are commonly known as stonecrops. The genus has been described as containing up to 600 species, subsequently reduced to 400–500. They are leaf succulents found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, but extending into the southern hemisphere in Africa and South America. The plants vary from annual and creeping herbs to shrubs. The plants have water-storing leaves. The flowers usually have five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals. Various species formerly classified as &quot;Sedum&quot; are now in the segregate genera &quot;Hylotelephium&quot; and &quot;Rhodiola&quot;.

Well-known European species of &quot;Sedum&quot; are &quot;Sedum acre&quot;, &quot;Sedum album&quot;, &quot;Sedum dasyphyllum&quot;, and &quot;Sedum hispanicum&quot;.

==Description==

&quot;Sedum&quot; is a genus that includes annual, biennial, and perennial herbs. They are characterised by succulent leaves and stems. The extent of morphological diversity and homoplasy make it impossible to characterise &quot;Sedum&quot; phenotypicaly.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Sedum&quot; was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, with 15 species. Of the genera encompassed by the Crassulaceae family, &quot;Sedum&quot; is the most species rich, the most morphologically diverse and most complex taxonomically. Historically, it was placed in the subfamily Sedoideae, of which it was the type genus. Of the three modern subfamilies of the Crassulaceae, based on molecular phylogenetics, &quot;Sedum&quot; is placed in the subfamily Sempervivoideae. Although the genus has been greatly reduced, from about 600 to 420–470 species, by forming up to 32 segregate genera, it still constitutes a third of the family and is polyphyletic.

&quot;Sedum&quot; species are found in four of six major crown clades within subfamily Sempervivoideae of Crassulaceae and are allocated to tribes, as follows:

In addition, at least nine other distinct genera appear to be nested within &quot;Sedum&quot;. However, the number of species found outside of the first two clades (Tribe Sedeae) are only a small fraction of the whole genus. Therefore the current circumscription, which is somewhat artificial and catch-all must be considered unstable. The relationships between the tribes of Sempervivoideae is shown in the cladogram.
There are now thought to be approximately 55 European species in the genus. &quot;Sedum&quot; demonstrates a wide variation in chromosome numbers, and polyploidy is common. Chromosome number is considered an important taxonomic feature.

Earlier authors placed a number of &quot;Sedum&quot; species outside of these clades, such as &quot;S. spurium&quot;, &quot;S. stellatum&quot; and &quot;S. kamtschaticum&quot; (Telephium clade), that has been segregated into &quot;Phedimus&quot; (tribe Umbiliceae). Given the substantial taxonomic challenges presented by this highly polyphyletic genus, a number of radical solutions have been proposed for what is described as the &quot;Sedum problem&quot;, all of which would require a substantial number of new combinations within Sempervivoideae. Nikulin and colleagues (2016) have recommended that, given the monophyly of Aeonieae and Semperviveae, species of &quot;Sedum&quot; outside of the tribe Sedeae (all in subgenus &quot;Gormania&quot;) be removed from the genus and reallocated. However, this does not resolve the problem of other genera embedded within &quot;Sedum&quot;, in Sedeae. In the largest published phylogenetic study (2020), the authors propose placing all taxa within Sedeae in genus &quot;Sedum&quot;, and transferring all other Sedum species in the remaining Sempervivoideae clades to other genera. This expanded &quot;Sedum&quot; &quot;s.l.&quot; would comprise about 755 species.

===Subdivision===

Linnaeus originally described 15 species, characterised by pentamerous flowers, dividing them into two groups; Planifolia and Teretifolia, based on leaf morphology, with 15 species, and hence bears his name as the botanical authority (L.). By 1828, de Candolle recognized 88 species in six informal groups. Various attempts have been made to subdivide this large genus, in addition to segregating separate genera, including creation of informal groups, sections, series and subgenera. For an extensive history of subfamily Sedoideae, see .

Gray (1821) divided the 13 species known in Britain at that time into five sections; &quot;Rhodiola&quot;, &quot;Telephium&quot;, &quot;Sedum&quot;, (unnamed) and &quot;Aizoon&quot;. In 1921, Praeger established ten sections; &quot;Rhodiola&quot;, &quot;Pseudorhodiola&quot;, &quot;Giraldiina&quot;, &quot;Telephium&quot;, &quot;Aizoon&quot;, &quot;Mexicana&quot;, &quot;Seda Genuina&quot;, &quot;Sempervivoides&quot;, &quot;Epeteium&quot; and &quot;Telmissa&quot;. This was later revised in what is the best known system, that of Berger (1930), who defined 22 subdivisions, which he called &quot;Reihe&quot; (sections or series). Berger&#x27;s sections were:

* &quot;Rhodiola&quot;
* &quot;Pseudorhodiola&quot;
* &quot;Telephium&quot;
* &quot;Sedastrum&quot;
* &quot;Hasseanthus&quot;
* &quot;Lenophyllopsis&quot;
* &quot;Populisedum&quot;
* &quot;Graptopetalum&quot;
* &quot;Monanthella&quot;
* &quot;Perrierosedum&quot;
* &quot;Pachysedum&quot;
* &quot;Dendrosedum&quot;
* &quot;Fruticisedum&quot;
* &quot;Leptosedum&quot;
* &quot;Afrosedum&quot;
* &quot;Aizoon&quot;
* &quot;Seda genuina&quot;
* &quot;Prometheum&quot;
* &quot;Cyprosedum&quot;
* &quot;Epeteium&quot;
* &quot;Sedella&quot;
* &quot;Telmissa&quot;
A number of these, he further subdivided. In contrast, Fröderströmm (1935) adopted a much broader circumscription of the genus, accepting only &quot;Sedum&quot; and &quot;Pseudosedum&quot; within the Sedoideae, dividing the former into 9 sections. Although this was followed by numerous other systems, the most widely accepted infrageneric classification following Berger, was by Ohba (1978). Prior to this, most species in Sedoideae were placed in genus &quot;Sedum&quot;. Of these systems, it was observed &quot;No really satisfactory basis for the division of the family into genera has yet been proposed&quot;.

Some other authors have added other series, and combined some of the series into groups, such as sections. In particular, &quot;Sedum&quot; section &quot;Sedum&quot; is divided into series (see Clades) More recently, two subgenera have been recognised, &quot;Gormania&quot; and &quot;Sedum&quot;.
* &quot;Gormania&quot;: . 110 species from Sempervivum, Aeonium and Leucosedum clades. Europe and North America. 
* &quot;Sedum&quot;: 320 species from Acre clade. Temperate and subtropical zones of Northern hemisphere (Asia and the Americas).

Subgenus &quot;Sedum&quot; has been considered as three geographically distinct, but equal sized sections:
* &quot;S.&quot; sect. &quot;Sedum&quot; ca. 120 spp. native to Europe, Asia Minor and N. Africa, ranging from N. Africa to central Scandinavia and from Iceland to the Ural Mountains, the Caucasus and Iran. 
* &quot;S.&quot; sect. &quot;Americana&quot; 
* &quot;S.&quot; sect. &quot;Asiatica&quot; 

&quot;S.&quot; sect. &quot;Sedum&quot; includes 54 species native to Europe, which Berger classified into 27 series.

==Distribution and habitat==

Distributed mainly in temperate to subtropical climates in the Northern hemisphere, extending to the Southern hemisphere in Africa and South America, being most diverse in the Mediterranean, Central America, Himalayas, and East Asia. In this respect, the two subgenera differ. Subgenus &quot;Sedum&quot; having a centre of diversity in Mexico, and Gormania in Eurasia with a secondary centre in North America.

==Ecology==

&quot;Sedum&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the grey chi moth. In particular, &quot;Sedum spathulifolium&quot; is the host plant of the endangered San Bruno elfin butterfly of San Mateo County, California. &quot;Sedum lanceolatum&quot; is the host plant of the more common &quot;Parnassius smintheus&quot; found in the Rocky Mountains. As well as &quot;Sedum spathulifolium&quot;, many other species of &quot;Sedum&quot; serve the environmental role of host plants for butterflies. For example, the butterfly &quot;Callophrys xami&quot; uses several species of &quot;Sedum&quot;, such as &quot;Sedum allantoides&quot;, for suitable host plants.

==Uses==

===Ornamental===

Many sedums are cultivated as ornamental garden plants, due to their interesting and attractive appearance and hardiness. The various species differ in their requirements; some are cold-hardy but do not tolerate heat, some require heat but do not tolerate cold.

Numerous hybrid cultivars have been developed, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit: 
* &#x27;Herbstfreude&#x27; (&#x27;Autumn Joy&#x27;)
* &#x27;Bertram Anderson&#x27;
* &#x27;Matrona&#x27;
* &#x27;Ruby Glow&#x27;

===As food===

The leaves of most stonecrops are edible, excepting &quot;Sedum rubrotinctum,&quot; although toxicity has also been reported in some other species. The juice from the stems and leaves may irritate skin if handled excessively.

&quot;Sedum reflexum&quot;, known as &quot;prickmadam&quot;, &quot;stone orpine&quot;, or &quot;crooked yellow stonecrop&quot;, is occasionally used as a salad leaf or herb in Europe, including the United Kingdom. It has a slightly astringent sour taste.

&quot;Sedum divergens&quot;, known as &quot;spreading stonecrop&quot;, was eaten by First Nations people in northwest British Columbia. The plant is used as a salad herb by the Haida and the Nisga&#x27;a people. It is common in the Nass Valley of British Columbia.

Biting stonecrop (&quot;Sedum acre&quot;) contains high quantities of piperidine alkaloids (namely (+)-sedridine, (−)-sedamine, sedinone and isopelletierine), which give it a sharp, peppery, acrid taste and make it somewhat toxic.

===Roofing===

&quot;Sedum&quot; can be used to provide a roof covering in green roofs, where they are preferred to grasses. Examples include Ford&#x27;s Dearborn, Michigan Truck Plant, which has a living roof with of sedum. The Rolls-Royce Motor Cars plant in Goodwood, England, has a roof complex covered in &quot;Sedum&quot;, the largest in the United Kingdom. Nintendo of America&#x27;s roof is covered in some of &quot;Sedum&quot;. The Javits Center in New York City is covered with of &quot;Sedum&quot;.

===Green tramway===

Berlin&#x27;s Prenzlauer Allee, Le Mans, and Warsaw, for example, plant sedum in between rails of some tramways as a low maintenance alternative to grass. This provides beautification, a permeable surface for water management, and noise reduction.

<text>Patrick J. Fitzgerald (born December 22, 1960) is an American lawyer and former partner at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.

For more than a decade, until June 30, 2012, Fitzgerald was the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Prior to his appointment, he served as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York from 1988 to 2001, and as Chief of the Organized Crime-Terrorism Unit since December 1995, where he participated in the prosecutions of Osama bin Laden, Omar Abdel-Rahman, and Ramzi Yousef.

As special counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel, Fitzgerald was the federal prosecutor in charge of the investigation of the Valerie Plame Affair, which led to the prosecution and conviction in 2007 of Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s chief of staff Scooter Libby for perjury and obstruction of justice.

As a federal prosecutor, he led a number of high-profile investigations, including those which led to convictions of Illinois Governors Rod Blagojevich and George Ryan, media mogul Conrad Black, several aides to Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley in the Hired Truck Program, and Chicago police detective and torturer Jon Burge.

==Personal==
Fitzgerald was born into a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent in Brooklyn. His father (also named Patrick Fitzgerald) worked as a doorman in Manhattan and a security guard at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair in Flushing, Queens. Fitzgerald attended Our Lady Help of Christians grammar school, before going on to Regis High School. He received degrees in economics and mathematics from Amherst College, Phi Beta Kappa, before receiving his JD from Harvard Law School in 1985. He played rugby at Amherst and at Harvard he was a member of the Harvard Business School Rugby Club.

Fitzgerald married Jennifer Letzkus in June 2008.

==Career==

===New York===
After practicing civil law, Fitzgerald became an Assistant United States Attorney in New York City in 1988. He handled drug trafficking cases and in 1993 assisted in the prosecution of Mafia figure John Gambino, a boss of the Gambino crime family. In 1994, Fitzgerald became the prosecutor in the case against Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 others charged in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

In 1996, Fitzgerald became the National Security Coordinator for the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. There, he served on a team of prosecutors investigating Osama bin Laden. He also served as chief counsel in prosecutions related to the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

===Illinois===
On September 1, 2001, Fitzgerald was nominated for the position of U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois on the recommendation of U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald (no relation), a Republican from Illinois. On October 24, 2001, the nomination was confirmed by the Senate. The Senator urged the selection because Patrick Fitzgerald is not from Chicago; Patrick said that he had visited Chicago only one day, for a wedding in 1982, before his selection.

Soon after becoming U.S. Attorney for Northern Illinois, Fitzgerald began an investigation of political appointees of Republican Illinois Governor George Ryan, who were suspected of accepting bribes to give licenses to unqualified truck drivers. Fitzgerald soon expanded this investigation, uncovering a network of political bribery and gift-giving, and leading to more than 60 indictments. Ryan was indicted in December 2003. At the conclusion of the trial in April 2006, Ryan was found guilty on all eighteen counts against him. Ryan&#x27;s co-defendant, Chicago businessman Larry Warner, then 67 years old, was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, fraud, attempted extortion, and money laundering. The two were sentenced on September 6, 2006: Ryan received a sentence of six and one half years, and Warner received a sentence of three years and five months.

Against criticism that these cases were based on circumstantial evidence, Fitzgerald responded: &quot;People now know that if you&#x27;re part of a corrupt conduct, where one hand is taking care of the other and contracts are going to people, you don&#x27;t have to say the word &#x27;bribe&#x27; out loud. And I think people need to understand we won&#x27;t be afraid to take strong circumstantial cases into court.&quot;
On July 18, 2005, his office indicted a number of top aides to Democrat Richard M. Daley, the mayor of Chicago, on charges of mail fraud, alleging numerous instances of corruption in hiring practices at City Hall.

In March 2006, former Chicago City Clerk James Laski pleaded guilty to pocketing nearly $50,000 in bribes for steering city business to two trucking companies. Laski was the highest-ranking Chicago official and Daley administration employee brought down by Fitzgerald&#x27;s office in conjunction with the Hired Truck Program scandal. Beginning in April 2007, Fitzgerald oversaw Operation Crooked Code, the investigation and prosecution of over two dozen defendants for bribery and related charges in Chicago&#x27;s Department of Buildings and Zoning.

On December 9, 2008, federal agents arrested Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich for conspiring to profit from his authority to appoint President Barack Obama&#x27;s successor to the U.S. Senate. Fitzgerald said Blagojevich &quot;put a &#x27;for sale&#x27; sign on the naming of a United States Senator.&quot;

Senator Peter Fitzgerald chose not to run for reelection in 2004, leaving Patrick Fitzgerald without a congressional patron. In the summer of 2005, there were rumors that he would not be reappointed to a second four-year term in retaliation for his investigations into corruption in Illinois and Chicago government, as well as for his investigation of the Plame scandal. 

On May 23, 2012, Fitzgerald held a press conference informing the public that he was stepping down from his position and retiring as the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Federal Court effective June 30, 2012. Long-time prosecutor Gary S. Shapiro was named US Attorney until a replacement was selected.

In 2013, Fitzgerald was appointed by Governor Patrick Quinn (D-IL) to the Board of Trustees for the University of Illinois.

===Private practice===
Fitzgerald joined Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in the firm&#x27;s Chicago office as a partner, in 2012. In June 2023, Fitzgerald retired from the firm.

==Notable cases==
===Plame investigation===

On December 30, 2003, after then-Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the CIA leak grand jury investigation of the Plame affair due to conflicts of interest, Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, acting as Attorney General in Ashcroft&#x27;s place, appointed Fitzgerald to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel in charge of the investigation. Fitzgerald was well-known to Comey and was in fact already godfather to one of Comey&#x27;s children.

On December 30, 2003, three months after the start of the Plame investigation, Fitzgerald was appointed Special Counsel. Through this, Fitzgerald was delegated &quot;all the authority of the Attorney General&quot; in the matter. In February 2004, Acting Attorney General Comey clarified the delegated authority and stated that Fitzgerald has plenary authority. Comey also wrote &quot;further, my conferral on you of the title of &#x27;Special Counsel&#x27; in this matter should not be misunderstood to suggest that your position and authorities are defined and limited by 28 CFR Part 600.&quot;

On October 28, 2005, Fitzgerald brought an indictment for five counts of false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice against Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s Chief of Staff. Libby resigned to prepare for his legal defense. In his first press conference after announcing Libby&#x27;s indictment, Fitzgerald was asked about comments by Republicans such as Kay Bailey Hutchison, who said &quot;I certainly hope that if there is going to be an indictment that says something happened, that it is an indictment on a crime and not some perjury technicality,&quot; to which Fitzgerald responded, &quot;That talking point won&#x27;t fly. The truth is the engine of our judicial system. If you compromise the truth, the whole process is lost. If we were to walk away from this, we might as well hand in our jobs.&quot;&quot;

Robert Novak&#x27;s testimony in Libby&#x27;s perjury trial made it known that the two senior administration sources he cited in his article were Richard Armitage and Karl Rove. A month later Armitage claimed Fitzgerald had instructed him not to go public with this information. Journalist Michael Isikoff received confirmation from Rove&#x27;s lawyer and from lobbyist Richard F. Hohlt that Rove was also faxed an advance copy of the article several days before it was published.

On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted of 4 out of 5 charges of lying under oath. Fitzgerald announced on the courthouse steps that while he is always open to receiving new information related to the case, he expects to file no further charges, and the prosecutors would &quot;return to their day jobs&quot;. Libby was sentenced to a $250,000 fine, 2 years of probation and a 2½ year prison term. After a court of appeals rejected Libby&#x27;s attempt to delay the prison sentence while he appealed the verdict, President George W. Bush commuted the prison portion of Libby&#x27;s sentence but did not commute the fine.

Two days after the verdict, Congressman Henry Waxman, chair of the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, announced that his committee would ask Plame to testify on March 16, in an effort by his committee to look into &quot;whether White House officials followed appropriate procedures for safeguarding Plame&#x27;s identity.&quot;

In March 2007, Fitzgerald was ranked among prosecutors who &quot;had not distinguished themselves&quot; as opposed to &quot;strong U.S. Attorneys who exhibited loyalty to the administration&quot; on a Justice Department chart sent to the White House in March 2005. This was revealed in light of an investigation of the December 2006 firings of several U.S. Attorneys by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, perceived as being politically motivated and despite Fitzgerald&#x27;s previous Attorney General&#x27;s Award for Distinguished Service in 2002. Two other prosecutors so ranked were dismissed. On July 2, 2007, President Bush provided a statement on his decision to commute Libby&#x27;s prison sentence and noted:

After the investigation was under way, the Justice Department appointed United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald as a Special Counsel in charge of the case. Mr. Fitzgerald is a highly qualified, professional prosecutor who carried out his responsibilities as charged.

Libby was eventually pardoned by President Donald Trump on April 13, 2018.

===Conrad Black and Hollinger===
On November 17, 2005, Fitzgerald brought criminal fraud charges against former Canadian media mogul Conrad Black, as well as against three other Hollinger executives. The trial of Black began at the federal court in Chicago in March 2007. Black was convicted on July 13, 2007 and was later sentenced to serve 78 months in federal prison, pay Hollinger $6.1 million and a fine of $125,000.

===RISCISO Indictments===
On February 1, 2006, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office under Fitzgerald announced that it was indicting nineteen members of Risciso, a software and movie piracy ring, in U.S. District Court in Chicago. The prosecution was the result of an undercover investigation, Operation Jolly Roger, that was part of Operation Site Down—an initiative by the FBI and law enforcement agents from ten other countries to disrupt and dismantle many of the leading warez groups that distribute and trade in copyrighted software, movies, music, and games on the Internet.

===Blagojevich corruption arrest===

On December 9, 2008, Fitzgerald confirmed in a press conference in Chicago that Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, had been arrested by the FBI early that morning on charges of corruption. Fitzgerald described Blagojevich&#x27;s actions as the &quot;kind of conduct [that] would make Lincoln roll over in his grave.&quot; Blagojevich was charged with mail fraud and solicitation of a bribe. According to Fitzgerald, Blagojevich attempted to sell off President-elect Barack Obama&#x27;s open U.S. Senate seat to the highest bidder, as well as pressuring the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; to fire editors critical of the Blagojevich administration in exchange for state assistance in selling Wrigley Field. Fitzgerald said at the news conference that, &quot;I laid awake at night&quot;, worrying about the possible firing of Tribune editors.

===Larry Nassar investigation===
In 2014, Fitzgerald was hired by Michigan State University to conduct an internal investigation to discover whether and when university officials knew about sexual assault allegations against Dr. Larry Nassar. Fitzgerald reported to university officials that no MSU official &quot;believed&quot; that Nassar had committed sexual assault, but did not provide any written report detailing the evidence for this claim.

<doc id="709407" wikidata="Q1334578" url="?curid=709407" title="William B. Saxbe">
<text>William Bart Saxbe ( ; June 24, 1916 – August 24, 2010) was an American diplomat and politician affiliated with the Republican Party, who served as a U.S. Senator for Ohio, and was the Attorney General for Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, and as the U.S. Ambassador to India.

At the time of his death, Saxbe was the oldest living Republican Senator and the second-oldest living Senator overall (after Harry F. Byrd Jr. of Virginia).

==Early life and career==

Saxbe was born 1916 in Mechanicsburg, Ohio, the son of Faye Henry &quot;Maggie&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Carey) Saxbe, and Bart Rockwell Saxbe.

He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree, from The Ohio State University, Class of 1940, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity. He served in the U.S. Army Air Forces, during World War II, from 1940 to 1945, and Korean War, from 1951 to 1952.

When he returned from World War II, he entered Ohio State University law school. However, while still in law school, he campaigned for the Ohio House of Representatives during 1947, and won. During 1948, when Saxbe was near the end of second term, he received a law degree.

He remained in the Ohio National Guard and was on active duty during the Korean War, from 1951 to 1952. He was discharged from the reserve with the rank of colonel during 1963. He served as the Ohio House majority leader during 1951 and 1952, and as speaker of the House during 1953 and 1954.

==Political career==
During 1957, Saxbe was elected Ohio Attorney General, defeating Democrat Stephen M. Young. He was re-elected three times and had that office until 1968. In this capacity, Saxbe argued the murder case of Doctor Sam Sheppard before the United States Supreme Court during 1966, against Sheppard&#x27;s attorney F. Lee Bailey.

He was a member of the Ohio Crime Commission from 1967 to 1968. During 1968, Saxbe was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating the Democratic candidate, former Ohio Rep. (1965–1967) John J. Gilligan. During his campaign, he became a prominent supporter of a national health insurance system, co-sponsoring the Kennedy-Griffiths universal healthcare program in 1971 alongside fellow Republicans Jacob Javits (New York), Clifford Case (New Jersey) and John Sherman Cooper (Kentucky). When President Nixon resumed bombing North Vietnam in late 1972, Saxbe stated that the President had &#x27;lost his senses&#x27;.

He served in the Senate until January 3, 1974, when Nixon appointed him U.S. Attorney General. Saxbe was the permanent replacement for Elliot Richardson, who had been dismissed by Nixon during the Watergate scandal&#x27;s so-called &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot;. Saxbe took over from Solicitor General Robert Bork, who had served as acting Attorney General after the &quot;Massacre&quot;.

There was some minor controversy regarding Saxbe&#x27;s appointment and the Ineligibility Clause of the Constitution. That provision states that a legislator cannot be appointed to an executive position during the same term that the legislature had voted to increase the salary of said position. Nixon addressed the problem by having Congress reduce the salary of the Attorney General to $35,000, as it was before Saxbe&#x27;s term in the Senate began. This maneuver had only occurred once before, when Senator Philander C. Knox had been appointed Secretary of State during 1909, and has since become known as the &quot;Saxbe fix&quot;. Because there was not any perception that anything &quot;intentional&quot; had been done to benefit Saxbe, the matter was largely ignored.

As Attorney General for Nixon, Saxbe supervised the antitrust suit that ultimately ended the Bell System telephone monopoly.

Gilligan, who had been elected Governor of Ohio during 1970, appointed Howard Metzenbaum to serve Saxbe&#x27;s vacated term. Later that year, former astronaut John Glenn, another Democrat, was elected to replace Saxbe.

Saxbe served as U.S. Attorney General for the first few months of the President Ford Administration, before resigning in early 1975, when he was appointed United States Ambassador to India. He served in that capacity until 1977. After that, Saxbe returned to Mechanicsburg and resumed the practice of law.

==Personal life and death==
During 1940, Saxbe married the former Ardath Louise &quot;Dolly&quot; Kleinhans. They had three children: William Bart Saxbe Jr., Juliet Louise &quot;Juli&quot; Saxbe Spitzer, and Charles Rockwell &quot;Rocky&quot; Saxbe. Charles Saxbe served four terms in Ohio House of Representatives, and later as an attorney in private practice.

Saxbe was known for his quips. Asked about Sen. Bob Dole, he commented that Dole was so unpopular with his fellow senators at the time that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t sell beer on a troop ship&quot;.

He died in his hometown of Mechanicsburg, Ohio, at the age of 94 on August 24, 2010.

<text>The Ardeatine massacre, or Fosse Ardeatine massacre (), was a mass killing of 335 civilians and political prisoners carried out in Rome on 24 March 1944 by German occupation troops during the Second World War as a reprisal for the Via Rasella attack in central Rome against the SS Police Regiment Bozen the previous day.

Subsequently, the Ardeatine Caves site (&quot;Fosse Ardeatine&quot;) was declared a Memorial Cemetery and National Monument open daily to visitors. Every year, on the anniversary of the slaughter and in the presence of the senior officials of the Italian Republic, a solemn state commemoration is held at the monument in honour of the fallen. Each year, 335 names are called out, a simple roll call of the dead, to reinforce that 335 discrete individuals symbolise a collective entity.

==Historical background==

In July 1943, the Allies landed on the island of Sicily, preparing to invade the mainland, and Rome was bombed for the first time. On 24 July 1943, the Fascist Grand Council, which the dictator Benito Mussolini had not convened since 1939, met and overwhelmingly voted no confidence in Mussolini. The following day, anxious to extricate his country from an unsustainable war, King Victor Emanuel III, the titular head of the Italian state and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces under Mussolini, appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio to head a new military government. He then ordered his gendarmerie, the Carabinieri, to arrest and imprison Mussolini.

On 13 August 1943, Rome was bombed again, and the Badoglio government began secret surrender negotiations with the Allies in Sicily, although still outwardly allied to Nazi Germany. In accordance with the Pope&#x27;s wishes, Badoglio also unilaterally declared Rome an open city, i.e., a demilitarized zone, a declaration the Allies would refuse to recognise and the Germans to respect. The Germans, anticipating an Italian defection, meanwhile began moving more and more troops into Italy (Operation Achse). Foreseeing a German invasion, a coalition of Anti-Fascist parties and Monarchists formed the Committee of National Liberation (CLN). On 3 September 1943, the Badoglio government signed an unconditional surrender, which U.S. General Eisenhower made public on the eve of the Fifth Army&#x27;s amphibious landing at Salerno (8 September). At the same time, Badoglio issued the Badoglio Proclamation, directing Italian troops to end hostilities against the Allies but to oppose attacks &quot;from any other quarter&quot;.

The following day, the German army began moving in on Rome, and that night the King and Badoglio fled the city for Pescara, whence by sea to Bari, leaving a leadership vacuum. The Royal Italian Army, although outnumbering the German soldiers three to one, was leaderless, poorly equipped, and in chaos. After a failed resistance in the working-class neighbourhood at the Porta San Paolo and the Pyramid of Cestius by remaining loyalist soldiers, carabinieri (including a school of cadets) and civilians, the Germans occupied Rome. They announced the imposition of German military law with summary execution for violators. 

Three days later (on 12 September), Nazi commandos led by Waffen-SS officer Otto Skorzeny, tracked down and rescued Mussolini from his hidden prison in the Gran Sasso and set him up in the puppet regime of the so-called &quot;Republic of Salò&quot; in Northern Italy. In October 1943 the Nazis rounded up and deported the Jews of Rome for extermination at Auschwitz and also made numerous mass roundups of non-Jewish male civilians for forced labour. Meanwhile, General Mark Clark&#x27;s Fifth Army in Salerno suffered severe setbacks, and General Eisenhower and other Allied leaders began concentrating their attention on the imminent invasion of France, temporarily neglecting Italy.

In December, the armed Partisan Resistance began to strike German forces in Rome. The Germans responded with raids carried out by mixed Gestapo and Italian Fascist police militias on Vatican institutions, known to be harbouring prominent CNL members and other Anti-Fascists. In January 1944, news of the surprise Allied landing behind enemy lines at Anzio (Operation Shingle), only 30 miles from Rome, created temporary euphoria among the Roman populace along with a dangerous relaxation of caution on the part of Resistance members, that enabled the Nazis to arrest and torture many of its most important leaders. In the meantime, General Clark&#x27;s attempt to link up the Fifth Army with the Anzio troops was unsuccessful, as the Anzio forces were held back by a line of German fortifications hastily constructed using forced civilian labour.

==Partisan attack in Via Rasella==
On 23 March 1944, a column of the German 11th Company, 3rd Battalion, Police Regiment &quot;South Tyrol&quot; was attacked by an ambush of Partisans, while marching and singing on a prescribed route that led through the Piazza di Spagna into the narrow street of Via Rasella. Organised by the Nazis to intimidate and suppress the Resistance, the battalion had been raised in October 1943 from ethnic German speakers of the northern Italian province of South Tyrol, a territory that Adolf Hitler had annexed to the German Reich after the September &quot;betrayal&quot; by the Italian government. Many of its citizens had since opted for German citizenship. The soldiers of the battalion were veterans of the Royal Italian Army who had seen action on the Eastern Front and had chosen service in the SS rather than face another tour in the East with the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

The attack was carried out by 12 partisans of the Communist-dominated resistance organisation &quot;Gruppo d&#x27;Azione Patriottica&quot; (&quot;Patriotic Action Group&quot;) or GAP. An improvised explosive device was prepared consisting of 12 kilogrammes of TNT packed in a steel case. This was inserted into a bag containing an additional six kilograms of TNT and TNT-filled iron tubing. Although reported as having been thrown from a building, the bomb had actually been hidden in a rubbish cart, pushed into position by a Partisan disguised as a street cleaner, while others acted as lookouts. The fuse was lit when the police were forty seconds from the bomb. The blast caused the immediate deaths of 28 German SS policemen and may have killed two civilian bystanders, one of whom, Piero Zuccheretti, was an eleven-year-old boy, although he might well have been killed by the Germans firing in response; it is unknown. 

More would die over the next few days. All twelve Partisans, some of whom fired on the German column, succeeded in melting away into the crowd unscathed.

==Preparations for the reprisal==

The German police attaché and commander of the Security Police in Rome, SS &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Herbert Kappler was on the scene soon afterwards to supervise the investigation. That evening he was summoned to the headquarters of the German Armed Forces Commandant in Rome, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Kurt Mälzer, who had decided that the killings called for reprisals.

They agreed that the execution of ten Italians for each German policeman killed was a suitable ratio. Mälzer, who also proposed burning down part of Rome, passed this on to General Eberhard von Mackensen, the commander of the Fourteenth Army, whose jurisdiction included Rome. General Mackensen endorsed the recommendation. In turn, the staff of the German Commander-in-Chief South (&quot;Oberbefehlshaber Süd&quot;), passed this on to the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW). That night, Adolf Hitler authorised the reprisal, stipulating that it be carried out within 24 hours. Commander-in-Chief South &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring, considered this an order, one he interpreted as calling for the execution of Italians who had been previously sentenced to death. He was assured by Kappler that sufficient prisoners were available.

However, Kappler had only four prisoners sentenced to death in his &quot;Hausgefängnis&quot; (private prison) at SS headquarters in the German Embassy on 145 Via Tasso (now the Museum of the Liberation of Rome); plus 17 serving long sentences; 167 deemed &quot;worthy of death&quot;; and two to four civilians who had been rounded up in the Via Rasella area on suspicion of involvement. Kappler&#x27;s superior, SS &quot;Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Polizei&quot; Wilhelm Harster, suggested making up the numbers from the 57 Jews also in Nazi custody. By noon on 24 March, Kappler had a list of 271 victims, each with his crime listed against his name, except for the Jews, who were simply listed as &quot;Jew&quot;. By this time the death toll from the Via Rasella bombing had risen to 32. (One more would die while the reprisal was underway; the death toll eventually reaching 33.) To make up the numbers, &quot;Questore&quot; Pietro Caruso, chief of the Fascist police in Rome, offered some Italians from his Regina Coeli prison, among them Maurizio Giglio, who had been one of his own lieutenants, before being unmasked as a double agent working for the American OSS in charge of radio communications with the Fifth Army. Because of the time limit that Hitler had imposed, Mälzer and Kappler agreed that the victims would have to be shot in the back of the head at close range rather than by conventional firing squad. The men of the regiment Bozen, the unit which was hit in the attack, were offered the chance to avenge their comrades, but they refused to do it in that way. 26 of the victims shot in the caves were Jews betrayed by Celeste Di Porto the terror of the Roman Ghetto.

==Massacre==
The massacre was perpetrated without prior public notice in a little-frequented rural suburb of the city, inside the tunnels of the disused quarries of &quot;pozzolana&quot;, near the Via Ardeatina. By mistake, a total of 335 Italian prisoners were taken, five in excess of the 330 called for. On 24 March, led by SS officers Erich Priebke and Karl Hass, they were transported to the Ardeatine caves in truckloads and then, in groups of five, put to death inside the caves. Because the killing squad mostly consisted of officers who had never killed before, Kappler had ordered several cases of cognac delivered to the caves to calm the officers&#x27; nerves. The officers were ordered to lead the doomed prisoners into the caves with their hands tied behind their backs and then have them kneel down so that the soldiers could fire a bullet directly into the cerebellum, ensuring that no more than one bullet would be needed per prisoner. Many were forced to kneel down over the bodies of those who had been killed before them because the cave had become filled with dead bodies. During the killings, the existence of the five extra prisoners was discovered, and it was decided to kill them anyway, in order to prevent the place of execution from becoming known.

The bodies of the victims were placed in piles, typically about a metre in height, and then buried under tons of rock debris when German military engineers set explosives to seal the caves and hide the atrocity. They remained summarily buried and abandoned for over a year inside the caves. Families of the victims were notified with excruciating slowness by an individual letter, if at all, a strategy of cover-up and concealment—&quot;Night and Fog&quot;—designed to confuse, grieve, and intimidate surviving relatives, according to Robert Katz.

==Victims==

Misconceptions about the Fosse Ardeatine Massacre abound. Foremost among these is the notion that the Partisans responsible for the Via Rasella attack were ordered to come forward and turn themselves over to the SS and wilfully declined to do so.

Although it is sometimes claimed that the reprisal victims were predominantly Jewish, only 75 of the 335 victims selected for death in the caves were Jewish, this having been a criterion for selection (because Jews were known to be marked for death anyway). In fact, the victims comprised, in Robert Katz&#x27;s words, &quot;rich, and poor, doctors and lawyers, workers and shopkeepers, artists and artisans, teachers and students, men and teenage boys from every walk of life, and even a man of God ... among them&quot;. The main concern of the SS had been the speedy fulfilment of the quota. Some were residents of Via Rasella who were home at the time of the Partisan attack; others had been arrested and tortured for suspected Resistance and other anti-Fascist activities, while still others had been casually picked up on the streets or arrested at their homes on the basis of tips from Fascist informants. The youngest of them was 15 years old.

Political prisoners included members of the GAP, the PA, and the Monarchist Clandestine Military Front of the Resistance (FMRC), which included many policemen. Members of the Bandiera Rossa (&quot;Red Flag&quot;) a dissident Communist Resistance group, constituted the largest group. One political prisoner, Padre Pietro Pappagallo, was one of the models for the character of Padre Pietro in Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s pioneering neo-realist film &quot;Rome, Open City&quot;, filmed in 1944. Another, perhaps the most celebrated, was the aristocratic Colonel Giuseppe Montezemolo (age 44), who, after the flight of the King and Badoglio, had elected to stay and go underground in Rome, disguised in mufti as a professor or &quot;Ingegnere&quot; (engineer), to organize and lead the FMRC, representing the Badoglio Government, with which he had been in continual radio contact up until his arrest on 25 January 1944.

Colonel Giuseppe Montezemolo&#x27;s incredible courage under torture which included having his nails and teeth pulled out, became legendary. Another was General Simone Simoni, a war hero aged 64, who had endured torture with a blowtorch. The old soldier had replied to his captors, &quot;My only regret is that I was not younger because there was so much more I could have done [for my country]&quot;. Neither man ever talked or in any way betrayed their network.

Besides Simoni, four more generals were among the executed, all members of the Clandestine Military Front: Vito Artale, Dardano Fenulli, Roberto Lordi, and Sabato Martelli Castaldi.

==The monument==

The design of the Fosse Ardeatine monument resulted from a national competition and was a collaboration between five architects (Nello Aprile, Cino Calcaprina, Aldo Cardelli, Mario Fiorentino &amp; Giuseppe Perugini) and two sculptors (Francesco Coccia &amp; Mirko Basaldella). The massive bronze gate by Mirko Basaldella used the ubiquitous barbed wire of battlefields and concentration camps as inspiration, merging it with the moving curlicues of a Tree of Life. The curved lines morph into a tangle of limbs reaching out across each other at those awkwardly bent angles characteristic of corpses. Also at the entrance is a colossal concrete statue by Francesco Coccia of three male figures standing together as one. Hands tied behind their backs, the three ages of man are bound together by ideals and fate—the youngest Fosse victim was 15, the oldest 70. Each face has a distinct expression portraying the range of emotions the men likely felt marching to their deaths in the quarry: despair, eyes half-closed in resignation, a resolute distant stare. Each face on the statue directs its gaze towards an important element of the memorial complex: the burial slab, the old quarries, and the forecourt. The memorial plaque outside the entry to the caves reads:

WAYFARERS THIRSTY FOR LIBERTY – WE WERE ROUNDED UP AT RANDOM – IN THE STREET AND IN JAIL – AS A REPRISAL CAST IN EN MASSE – SLAUGHTERED AND WALLED WITHIN THESE PITS – ITALIANS, DO NOT CURSE – MOTHERS, BRIDES, DO NOT WEEP – CHILDREN, CARRY WITH PRIDE – THE MEMORY – OF THE HOLOCAUST OF YOUR FATHERS – IF OUR SLAUGHTER – WILL HAVE HAD A PURPOSE BEYOND REVENGE – IT IS TO ENSHRINE THE RIGHT OF HUMAN EXISTENCE – AGAINST THE CRIME OF MURDER

Inside the former quarries themselves, there are two more plaques. One in the tunnel:

WE WERE SLAUGHTERED IN THIS PLACE BECAUSE – WE FOUGHT AGAINST INTERNAL TYRANNY – FOR FREEDOM AND AGAINST THE FOREIGNER – FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE HOMELAND – WE DREAMT A FREE, JUST – AND DEMOCRATIC ITALY. MAY OUR SACRIFICE AND OUR BLOOD – SOW THE SEED AND ACT AS WARNING FOR – GENERATIONS TO COME.

And another in the &#x27;cave&#x27; at the very end where the massacre actually took place:

HERE WE WERE SLAUGHTERED – VICTIMS OF A HORRENDOUS SACRIFICE – MAY OUR SACRIFICE GIVE RISE TO A BETTER HOMELAND – AND TO LASTING PEACE AMONG THE PEOPLES.
FROM THE DEPTHS, I HAVE CRIED OUT TO YOU, O LORD.

The last phrase, taken from Penitential Psalm 130, was most likely chosen for its parallel significance in Christianity and Judaism, simultaneously speaking for 260 Christians and 75 Jews killed and buried side by side. The text is written in both Latin and Hebrew: &quot;Clamavi ad Te, Domine&quot;;&quot;שיר המעלות, ממעמקים קראתיך י-ה&quot;.

==Legacy==
For a number of reasons, including (but not limited to): the large number of victims; the fact that many of them were innocent civilians casually taken only to make up the number of those to be killed; the cruel methods implemented (even by Nazi standards) to carry out the massacre; the fact that the reprisal order had come directly from Adolf Hitler, and the hiding of the bodies, which were buried summarily instead of being returned to their families – the slaughter became a symbol of the various massacres carried out against civilians in Italy, from 8 September 1943 until the German surrender on 8 May 1945.

In December 2007, Giorgio Bettio, a city councillor of Treviso, Italy and member of the Northern League party, suggested that &quot;With immigrants, we should use the same system the SS used, punish 10 of them for every slight against one of our citizens&quot;, in reference to Italy&#x27;s current debate over immigration policies. This comment was met with public condemnation, and Bettio later said, &quot;I certainly made a mistake in citing the SS&quot;. He claimed the incident had been &quot;sensationalized&quot; by the media.

==The Vatican==
The Vatican&#x27;s role in the massacre came under particular scrutiny following the publication of Robert Katz&#x27;s first book, &quot;Death in Rome&quot; (1967), in which he speculated that Pope Pius XII had advance knowledge of the Nazi orders and did little to forestall it. Katz wrote later that he had put together &quot;circumstantial evidence... from six separate sources, though no single element was conclusive.&quot; This charge was vigorously disputed by the Pope&#x27;s defenders.

In 1974, Katz was sued in the Roman courts by Pius&#x27;s niece, Countess Elena Pacelli Rossignani. Katz was initially found guilty, but an appeals court overturned this initial ruling. The appeals court decision was in turn appealed by the prosecution. Further evidence (&quot;the Governatorato document&quot; - see below) was revealed; the court case was reconfigured; and Katz was found guilty of &quot;intention to denigrate&quot; Pius XII. Ultimately, however, the case was dismissed without a ruling on the matter at hand, &quot;on the grounds of an amnesty dating back to 1970.&quot; Katz continued to publish various accusations against Pius XII until his death.

In 1980, a relevant document (&quot;the Governatorato document&quot;) was found in the Vatican archives and released by the Vatican. It was dated 24 March 1944, 10:15 a.m., and contained intelligence gathered only hours after the attack on the SS troops. Addressed to the Papal Secretariat, it showed that the Vatican had indeed heard that the Germans were planning to punish Italian citizens tenfold for the SS deaths. However, the information was received only five hours before the massacre took place; the informant&#x27;s statement was short and vague as to source; and it provided no information in regards to time, place, or logistics:

Katz elaborated on this in 2003 in &quot;The Battle for Rome: The Germans, The Allies, The Partisans, and The Pope, September 1943 – June 1944&quot;, using evidence from recently released OSS and Vatican sources that certain German diplomats, notably Eugen Dollmann, Himmler&#x27;s representative in Rome and German Consul Eitel Möllhausen had gone to Pope Pius&#x27; personal liaison to the German occupational authorities, Pankratius Pfeiffer, asking him to urge the Pope to intervene and limit reprisals on the grounds that they would inflame the Roman population and make the occupation (and negotiations for a separate peace with the Allies they all fervently wished for) even more difficult.

According to Katz, the Secretariat of the Vatican believed that &quot;the attack on Via Rasella had been undertaken to provoke the occupiers into an excessively repressive act and increase the people&#x27;s hatred of the Germans. &quot;This was what the Pope&#x27;s liaison Padre Pancrazio had been told in the Vatican the night before [the reprisal]. It was also the opinion held by Dollman and Möllhausen. None of them seemed to believe that the Partisans meant to hurt the Germans as never before to extend the popularity of the Resistance&quot; nor did they view the Via Rasella attack as a legitimate act of war. Instead, they viewed it as a tragic act of terrorism by Communists, as did the Vatican, and as some of its defenders still do. According to Joseph Lichten, author of a monograph defending Pius XII written after the publication of Rolf Hochhuth&#x27;s play, &quot;The Deputy&quot;:

In the aftermath of the massacre, Pope Pius XII debated whether to protest against the massacre but decided not to because, as one of his defenders reported, &quot;all the convents, all the religious houses of Rome were full of refugees, Communists, Jews, democrats and anti-Fascists, ex-generals, etc. Pius XII had even suspended the rules for the cloister. If Pius XII had made a public protest, there would have been searches in all these houses and catastrophe would have ensued&quot;.

Instead, a special editorial entitled &quot;The Deeds in Via Rasella&quot; appeared in the &quot;semi-official&quot; Vatican newspaper, the &quot;Osservatore Romano&quot;, deploring the violence of &quot;the guilty parties who escaped arrest&quot; (presumably the Partisans, however Stephen Walker in his book &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; writes that &quot;the wording is worthy of examination&quot; and speculates that this is a reference to &quot;the Nazis who rounded up over 300 people and then butchered them.&quot;) and urging Roman citizens to continue to exercise restraint to prevent further sacrifices of innocent people. &quot;In the face of such deeds, every honest heart is left profoundly grieved in the name of humanity and Christian sentiment. Thirty-two victims on the one hand, and on the other, three-hundred-and-twenty persons sacrificed for the guilty parties who escaped arrest.&quot; Subsequently, the Nazi occupation forces stepped up their hunt among Roman civilians for suspected Resistance supporters, whom it rounded up and tortured.

==Controversy==
In 1952, the new Italian Supreme Court declared the Via Rasella attack to have been a legitimate act of war after an appeal by Kappler&#x27;s lawyers of his conviction of guilt in the Ardeatine Massacre.

This decision was reaffirmed in 1999, when the Italian Supreme Court declared the Partisans immune from prosecution after a Roman prosecutor had unsuccessfully attempted to bring a suit against them for the death of the boy Piero Zuccheretti, who had been killed in Via Rasella. Historian Robert Wolfe finds &quot;persuasive&quot; Katz&#x27;s characterisation of the Pope&#x27;s decision to condemn the Partisans for the Via Rasella attack, rather than the Nazis for the reprisals, as evidence of &quot;a moral failure&quot; resulting from one of the &quot;great misreadings of history&quot;.

In the 1990s, there was a revisionist campaign by &quot;Il Giornale&quot;, a newspaper owned by Paolo Berlusconi, brother of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, to re-label the World War II Partisans responsible for the attack on Via Rasella as &quot;terrorists&quot;. In response, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation officially ruled that the act in Via Rasella had been a legitimate act of war and not a terrorist attack and ordered the publisher to pay punitive damages of 45 thousand euro. Nevertheless, some historians, such as Richard Raiber and István Deák, continue to imply that the Partisans were the equivalent of terrorists and were, moreover, responsible for avoidable suffering, thus offering some support for the official judgment of the Vatican at the time.

Historian Patrick Gallo, however, in &quot;For Love and Country: The Italian Resistance&quot; (2003), posited that the Rome-based Resistance not only undermined German morale but also achieved important strategic objectives and was hence not a useless provocation, as contended by critics, but an act of legitimate military significance in furthering the Allied victory.

Reviewing Katz&#x27;s book, &quot;The Battle for Rome&quot;, István Deák, on the other hand, cautions that although &quot;armed resistance during World War II was romanticised because the Nazis were such an appalling enemy and because in that war the guerrillas&#x27; targets were still mainly soldiers&quot;, it is increasingly hard to draw the line between freedom fighting and terrorism. In his opinion, Hague Conventions regulating irregular warfare has been &quot;more a failure than success&quot;. &quot;What is needed,&quot; Deák stresses, &quot;is a recognition of reality, namely that future wars will increasingly consist of civilians shooting at soldiers from hiding and frightened soldiers killing innocent civilians. And what is needed, in the aftermath of such a sobering recognition, is an attempt to create a new international law for the more efficient regulation of this type of horrible warfare.&quot; Robert Katz&#x27;s book, &quot;The Battle for Rome&quot;, Deák concludes, &quot;provides fine arguments for this necessary debate&quot;.

==Post-war fates of leading figures in the events==
Immediately after the war Roman Partisan leaders, including Rosario Bentivegna, the medical student who had set off the Via Rasella bomb, were recipients of medals conferred by the post-war Italian government.

Both Priebke and Kappler sought Vatican assistance after the war. Priebke escaped from a British prison camp in 1946 and fled, first to the Tyrol and then back to Rome, whence, using false papers supplied by the Vatican &quot;ratline&quot;, he emigrated to Argentina. He was unmasked on camera in 1994 during a television interview by ABC television reporter Sam Donaldson, brought back to Italy for trial, and sentenced to house arrest in the home of his lawyer, Paolo Giachini. He died on 11 October 2013 from natural causes at age 100. His last request to have his remains returned to Argentina to be buried alongside his wife was denied by Argentina. The Vatican issued an &quot;unprecedented ban&quot; on holding the funeral in any Catholic church in Rome. But the Society of St Pius X, a Catholic splinter group often accused of having far-right and anti-Semitic leanings, offered to hold the ceremony in the city of Albano Laziale. During the funeral service, violent clashes broke out between fascist sympathisers and anti-fascist protesters.

Don Florian Abrahamowicz, a priest expelled from the Society of St Pius X for his extreme right-wing views, told Italy&#x27;s Radio 24: &quot;Priebke was a friend of mine, a Christian, a faithful soldier.&quot;

Kappler, a Protestant until his late conversion in life, unsuccessfully sought asylum within the Vatican. Tried by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment in Gaeta, in 1977 he successfully escaped from a Roman military hospital where he had been undergoing treatment for cancer. He died unmolested the following year at his home in Soltau, West Germany, the West Germans having refused Italian requests to extradite him. 

==Dramatisations==
The event was recreated in the 1962 film &quot;Dieci italiani per un tedesco (Via Rasella)&quot; (&quot;Ten Italians for One German (Rasella Street)&quot;) directed by Filippo Walter Ratti and starring Gino Cervi.

In 1973, the feature film &quot;Massacre in Rome&quot; by George Pan Cosmatos was released starring Marcello Mastroianni and Richard Burton.

American composer William Schuman subtitled his Ninth Symphony, from 1968, &quot;Le fosse Ardeatine&quot; (&quot;The Ardeatine Caves&quot;) in memory of the victims. 

The 2017 novel entitled &quot;From Sand and Ash&quot; by Amy Harmon details a fictional account of the massacre.

<doc id="709412" wikidata="Q607096" url="?curid=709412" title="Antonomasia">
<text>In rhetoric, antonomasia is a kind of metonymy in which an epithet or phrase takes the place of a proper name, such as &quot;the little corporal&quot; for Napoleon I, or conversely the use of a proper name as an archetypal name, to express a generic idea. A frequent instance of antonomasia in the Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance was the use of the term &quot;the Philosopher&quot; to refer to Aristotle.

Stylistically, such epithets may be used for elegant variation to reduce repetition of names in phrases. The word comes from the Greek , &quot;antonomasia&quot;, itself from the verb , &quot;antonomazein&quot; &#x27;to name differently&#x27;.

== Archetypal names ==
The opposite of antonomasia is an archetypal name. One common example in French is the word for fox: the Latin-derived was replaced by , from Renart, the fox hero of the Roman de Renart (originally the German Reinhard).

<text>Karl Hass (5 October 1912 – 21 April 2004) was an SS &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; and German spy who helped deport more than 1,000 Italian Jews to Auschwitz. A perpetrator in the Ardeatine massacre, in which 335 civilians were murdered, he was tried and convicted in Italy in 1998. He spent the last years of his life under limited house arrest in &quot;the splendour of the beautiful Swiss Alps&quot;.

==Espionage==
Hass was born in Kiel. In 1934, he joined the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD), the SS&#x27;s intelligence service, where his ruthlessness brought promotion. After the downfall of Benito Mussolini and the occupation of Italy by Nazi Germany, he was sent to Rome to set up a network of radio operators and to organize saboteurs behind the invading Allied lines. While in Rome, serving under SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Herbert Kappler, he aided in the deportation of more than 1,000 Jews to Auschwitz.

Hass had Princess Mafalda of Savoy, the daughter of King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy, placed into German military custody, which eventually resulted in her death. He reputedly lured her to his headquarters in Rome by the suggestion that there was a message from her husband, who was then being held in Berlin. On her arrival at the German command, Hass had the princess arrested and sent for questioning to Munich. She was subsequently sent to Berlin and then to Buchenwald concentration camp, where she was wounded in an Allied bombing raid. Despite receiving medical attention at the camp, she died following an operation to amputate her infected arm.

==Ardeatine massacre==

Following a 23 March 1944 bomb attack in the Via Rasella by Italian resistance fighters that killed 33 soldiers, Hass, Capt. Erich Priebke and fellow officers rounded up 335 Italians and the next day transported them to the Ardeatine caves on the outskirts of Rome. Hass, Priebke and their soldiers systematically executed each captive with a shot to the back of the head. The Ardeatine massacre is one of the most notorious in the Italian history of World War II.

==Post-war==
After the war, Hass was taken prisoner by the Allies, but rather than being brought to justice for his war crimes, he was apparently employed by the United States Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) to spy on the Soviet Union. In 1953, the CIC dispensed with his services, suspecting he was a double agent working for Cominform, the Soviet intelligence network. Only Kappler was charged with the Ardeatine cave massacre.

At some point in the 1960s, Hass returned to Italy. According to journalist Mario Tedeschini Lalli, Hass appeared as an extra in several Italian films, including Luchino Visconti&#x27;s &quot;The Damned&quot; and &quot;Massacre in Rome&quot; - a film about the Ardeatine massacre. He may have also been employed by filmmakers as a technical advisor.

In 1994, Priebke, who had helped Hass with the executions, was interviewed in Argentina by an American television crew. As a result of the ensuing uproar in Italy, he was eventually extradited to stand trial. Hass returned to Italy to testify against Priebke, but decided against it and attempted to flee from his hotel room by climbing down from an outside balcony. He seriously injured himself after slipping and falling from the balcony and was taken to hospital, where he ultimately gave testimony to court officials. In the court records, Hass admitted the execution of two civilians, but defended his actions by claiming he was only following orders, a defence which has been ruled invalid since the Nuremberg trials.

Tried and convicted for his role in the Ardeatine action, Hass was sentenced to life in prison in 1998. Considered to be in poor health, he was held under limited house arrest in what was described as &quot;a retirement villa in his favourite area of Switzerland&quot; until his death in 2004.

<doc id="709417" wikidata="Q238551" url="?curid=709417" title="Dan Gable">
<text>Danny Mack Gable (born October 25, 1948) is an American former folkstyle and freestyle wrestler and coach. Considered to be one of the greatest wrestlers of all time, Gable is a two-time NCAA Division I national champion, a World gold medalist, and an Olympic gold medalist. Gable was only the third wrestler to be inducted into the United World Wrestling&#x27;s Hall of Fame in the Legend category. In 2014, Gable was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame and awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2020.

==Early life==
Gable was born and grew up in Waterloo, Iowa. When he was 15 years old, a teenager from his neighborhood murdered Gable&#x27;s 19-year-old sister. Although Gable called his sister&#x27;s death his &quot;biggest loss&quot;, he did not allow the tragedy to affect his focus on wrestling. Instead, he thought of it as a reason to train with even more determination:
He attended high school at West High School in Waterloo. During high school he was a three-time Iowa state champion with a 64-0 record.

==Wrestling career==
===College===
From 1967 to 1970, Gable attended Iowa State University, where he competed in wrestling. At Iowa State, he became a two-time NCAA Division I national champion and three-time finalist. Gable&#x27;s college career record was 118–1, with his only loss being in the NCAA final match during his senior season to Larry Owings of the University of Washington.

===Freestyle===
From 1971 to 1973, Gable competed internationally in freestyle wrestling. Highlights of his career include gold medals at the 1971 Tbilisi Tournament, the 1971 world championships, and the 1972 Olympic Games. At the 1972 Games, Gable won all six of his matches without giving up a point. After competing sporadically from 1974 to 1975, Gable retired and became a full-time coach. In 1991, Gable was awarded with the Art Abrams Lifetime Achievement Award by Cauliflower Alley Club.

==Coaching career==
From 1976 to 1997, Gable was the head wrestling coach at the University of Iowa. Gable&#x27;s teams compiled a dual meet record of 355–21–5. He coached 158 All-Americans, 50 national champions, 106 Big Ten champions, and 12 Olympians, including eight Olympic medalists. His teams won 21 Big Ten championships and 15 NCAA Division I titles.

In addition to coaching folkstyle wrestling at the University of Iowa, Gable coached freestyle wrestling. Gable was the head coach of three USA Olympic teams and six USA World teams.

==Legacy==
Gable has been written about in many magazines and numerous books, including &quot;Two Guys Named Dan&quot; (1976), &quot;From Gotch to Gable: A History of Wrestling in Iowa&quot; (1981), &quot;The Toughest Men in Sports&quot; (1984) and &quot;Legends of the Mat&quot; (2006), all by wrestling historian Mike Chapman.

The 2008 film, Never Back Down, mentioned Dan Gable. The antagonist and protagonist early in the film seem to bond over this Iowa athlete as the, &#x27;greatest Olympic wrestler ever... the &#x27;72 Games, never surrendered a point.&#x27;

The Dan Gable museum is named for him, which is located in his hometown of Waterloo, Iowa, part of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum.

Professional wrestler Chad Gable&#x27;s WWE in-ring name was named after him.

Olympic gold medalist freestyle wrestler Gable Steveson was named after him.

The &quot;Gable grip&quot; used in wrestling and mixed martial arts was named after him.

<doc id="709427" wikidata="Q609501" url="?curid=709427" title="Micro black hole">
<text>Micro black holes, also called mini black holes or quantum mechanical black holes, are hypothetical tiny (&lt;1 ) black holes, for which quantum mechanical effects play an important role. The concept that black holes may exist that are smaller than stellar mass was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Hawking.

It is possible that such black holes were created in the high-density environment of the early Universe (or Big Bang), or possibly through subsequent phase transitions (referred to as primordial black holes). They might be observed by astrophysicists through the particles they are expected to emit by Hawking radiation.

Some hypotheses involving additional space dimensions predict that micro black holes could be formed at energies as low as the TeV range, which are available in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider. Popular concerns have then been raised over end-of-the-world scenarios (see Safety of particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider). However, such quantum black holes would instantly evaporate, either totally or leaving only a very weakly interacting residue. Beside the theoretical arguments, cosmic rays hitting the Earth do not produce any damage, although they reach energies in the range of hundreds of TeV.

== Minimum mass of a black hole ==
In an early speculation, Stephen Hawking conjectured that a black hole would not form with a mass below about (roughly the Planck mass). To make a black hole, one must concentrate mass or energy sufficiently that the escape velocity from the region in which it is concentrated exceeds the speed of light.

Some extensions of present physics posit the existence of extra dimensions of space. In higher-dimensional spacetime, the strength of gravity increases more rapidly with decreasing distance than in three dimensions. With certain special configurations of the extra dimensions, this effect can lower the Planck scale to the TeV range. Examples of such extensions include large extra dimensions, special cases of the Randall–Sundrum model, and string theory configurations like the GKP solutions. In such scenarios, black hole production could possibly be an important and observable effect at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
It would also be a common natural phenomenon induced by cosmic rays.

All this assumes that the theory of general relativity remains valid at these small distances. If it does not, then other, currently unknown, effects might limit the minimum size of a black hole. Elementary particles are equipped with a quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum (spin). The correct conservation law for the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum of matter in curved spacetime requires that spacetime is equipped with torsion. The simplest and most natural theory of gravity with torsion is the Einstein–Cartan theory. Torsion modifies the Dirac equation in the presence of the gravitational field and causes fermion particles to be spatially extended. In this case the spatial extension of fermions limits the minimum mass of a black hole to be on the order of , showing that micro black holes may not exist. The energy necessary to produce such a black hole is 39 orders of magnitude greater than the energies available at the Large Hadron Collider, indicating that the LHC cannot produce mini black holes. But if black holes are produced, then the theory of general relativity is proven wrong and does not exist at these small distances. The rules of general relativity would be broken, as is consistent with theories of how matter, space, and time break down around the event horizon of a black hole. This would prove the spatial extensions of the fermion limits to be incorrect as well. The fermion limits assume a minimum mass needed to sustain a black hole, as opposed to the opposite, the minimum mass needed to start a black hole, which in theory is achievable in the LHC under some conditions.

== Stability ==

=== Hawking radiation ===

In 1975, Stephen Hawking argued that, due to quantum effects, black holes &quot;evaporate&quot; by a process now referred to as Hawking radiation in which elementary particles (such as photons, electrons, quarks and gluons) are emitted. His calculations showed that the smaller the size of the black hole, the faster the evaporation rate, resulting in a sudden burst of particles as the micro black hole suddenly explodes.

Any primordial black hole of sufficiently low mass will evaporate to near the Planck mass within the lifetime of the Universe. In this process, these small black holes radiate away matter. A rough picture of this is that pairs of virtual particles emerge from the vacuum near the event horizon, with one member of a pair being captured, and the other escaping the vicinity of the black hole. The net result is the black hole loses mass (due to conservation of energy). According to the formulae of black hole thermodynamics, the more the black hole loses mass, the hotter it becomes, and the faster it evaporates, until it approaches the Planck mass. At this stage, a black hole would have a Hawking temperature of (), which means an emitted Hawking particle would have an energy comparable to the mass of the black hole. Thus, a thermodynamic description breaks down. Such a micro black hole would also have an entropy of only 4 nats, approximately the minimum possible value. At this point then, the object can no longer be described as a classical black hole, and Hawking&#x27;s calculations also break down.

While Hawking radiation is sometimes questioned, Leonard Susskind summarizes an expert perspective in his book &quot;The Black Hole War&quot;: &quot;Every so often, a physics paper will appear claiming that black holes don&#x27;t evaporate. Such papers quickly disappear into the infinite junk heap of fringe ideas.&quot;

=== Conjectures for the final state ===
Conjectures for the final fate of the black hole include total evaporation and production of a Planck-mass-sized black hole remnant. Such Planck-mass black holes may in effect be stable objects if the quantized gaps between their allowed energy levels bar them from emitting Hawking particles or absorbing energy gravitationally like a classical black hole. In such case, they would be weakly interacting massive particles; this could explain dark matter.

== Primordial black holes ==
=== Formation in the early Universe ===
Production of a black hole requires concentration of mass or energy within the corresponding Schwarzschild radius. It was hypothesized by Zel&#x27;dovich and Novikov first and independently by Hawking that, shortly after the Big Bang, the Universe was dense enough for any given region of space to fit within its own Schwarzschild radius. Even so, at that time, the Universe was not able to collapse into a singularity due to its uniform mass distribution and rapid growth. This, however, does not fully exclude the possibility that black holes of various sizes may have emerged locally. A black hole formed in this way is called a primordial black hole and is the most widely accepted hypothesis for the possible creation of micro black holes. Computer simulations suggest that the probability of formation of a primordial black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, the most likely outcome would be micro black holes.

=== Expected observable effects ===
A primordial black hole with an initial mass of around would be completing its evaporation today; a less massive primordial black hole would have already evaporated. Under optimal conditions, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope satellite, launched in June 2008, might detect experimental evidence for evaporation of nearby black holes by observing gamma ray bursts. It is unlikely that a collision between a microscopic black hole and an object such as a star or a planet would be noticeable. The small radius and high density of the black hole would allow it to pass straight through any object consisting of normal atoms, interacting with only few of its atoms while doing so. It has, however, been suggested that a small black hole of sufficient mass passing through the Earth would produce a detectable acoustic or seismic signal.
On the moon, it may leave a distinct type of crater, still visible after billions of years.

== Human-made micro black holes ==

=== Feasibility of production ===
In familiar three-dimensional gravity, the minimum energy of a microscopic black hole is (equivalent to 1.6 GJ or 444 kWh), which would have to be condensed into a region on the order of the Planck length. This is far beyond the limits of any current technology. It is estimated that to collide two particles to within a distance of a Planck length with currently achievable magnetic field strengths would require a ring accelerator about 1,000 light years in diameter to keep the particles on track.

However, in some scenarios involving extra dimensions of space, the Planck mass can be as low as the TeV range. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has a design energy of for proton–proton collisions and 1,150 TeV for Pb–Pb collisions. It was argued in 2001 that, in these circumstances, black hole production could be an important and observable effect at the LHC or future higher-energy colliders. Such quantum black holes should decay emitting sprays of particles that could be seen by detectors at these facilities. A paper by Choptuik and Pretorius, published in 2010 in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot;, presented a computer-generated proof that micro black holes must form from two colliding particles with sufficient energy, which might be allowable at the energies of the LHC if additional dimensions are present other than the customary four (three spatial, one temporal).

=== Safety arguments ===
Hawking&#x27;s calculation and more general quantum mechanical arguments predict that micro black holes evaporate almost instantaneously. Additional safety arguments beyond those based on Hawking radiation were given in the paper, which showed that in hypothetical scenarios with stable micro black holes massive enough to destroy Earth, such black holes would have been produced by cosmic rays and would have likely already destroyed astronomical objects such as planets, stars, or stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs.

== Black holes in quantum theories of gravity ==
It is possible, in some theories of quantum gravity, to calculate the quantum corrections to ordinary, classical black holes. Contrarily to conventional black holes, which are solutions of gravitational field equations of the general theory of relativity, quantum gravity black holes incorporate quantum gravity effects in the vicinity of the origin, where classically a curvature singularity occurs. According to the theory employed to model quantum gravity effects, there are different kinds of quantum gravity black holes, namely loop quantum black holes, non-commutative black holes, and asymptotically safe black holes. In these approaches, black holes are singularity-free.

Virtual micro black holes were proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1995 and by Fabio Scardigli in 1999 as part of a Grand Unified Theory as a quantum gravity candidate.

<text>The Economic Ethics of the World Religions () is an unfinished book series by Max Weber. Weber&#x27;s work in the field of sociology of religion began with the book &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;. The book series contains &quot;The Religion of China&quot;, &quot;The Religion of India&quot;, and &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot;. However, his work was left incomplete as a result of his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot; with studies of early Christianity and Islam. The three main themes within the books were: religious ideas&#x27; effect on economic activities, the relationship between social stratification and religious ideas, and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation. His goal was to find reasons for the different developmental paths of the cultures of the Western world and the Eastern world, without making value judgments, unlike the contemporaneous social Darwinists. Weber simply wanted to explain the distinctive elements of Western civilisation. Weber also proposed a socio-evolutionary model of religious change where societies moved from magic to ethical monotheism, with the intermediatory steps of polytheism, pantheism, and monotheism. According to him, this was the result of growing economic stability, which allowed for professionalisation and the evolution of an increasingly sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed. Meanwhile, as their power became more centralised, the concept of a universal God became more popular and desirable.

<text>Ernest F. Pletschke is the name of the surveyor who platted Houghton, Michigan in 1854, prior to its incorporation as a village in 1861. In Houghton&#x27;s first days it was said that &quot;only thieves, crooks, murderers and Indians&quot; lived there.

An Ernest F. Pletschke, most likely the same individual (though this is by no means certain) also was a leading citizen of nearby Outagamie County, Wisconsin during the American Civil War era. This Pletschke was a professor of German at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. In November 1860, he and forty students formed a local militia company, with Pletschke as Captain and a Professor Pomeroy as First Lieutenant.
In April 1861, Professor Pletschke became the captain of the Appleton Light Infantry, with one T. R. Hudd as First Lieutenant. On May 31, 1861, Pletschke offered the services of his company to Adjutant-General William L. Utley in the Union&#x27;s battle against the southern rebels; Utley accepted in early June, noting that the Appleton Light Infantry would likely be called upon within ten days. They were mustered into service soon after. His command was folded into the regiment of Colonel Frank J. Hecker of Illinois, where his captaincy was confirmed and made official.

Pletschke died in October 1861 at Louisville, Kentucky as a result of a relapse of typhoid fever, which he had contracted at some earlier, unspecified time. He was survived by a widow and a daughter. His funeral was held in the Lawrence Memorial Chapel at Lawrence University.

<text>John Robert Nicholls (born 13 August 1939) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Carlton Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Widely regarded as one of Australian football&#x27;s greatest players, Nicholls was the first Carlton player to play 300 games for the club, and was declared the club&#x27;s greatest player. He represented Victoria a record 31 times in interstate football, and was inducted as one of the inaugural Legends when the Australian Football Hall of Fame was established in 1996. Nicholls played most of his football as a ruckman, and although at 189 centimetres he was not especially tall, he compensated his lack of height with his intelligence and imposing physical presence, which earned him the nickname &#x27;Big Nick&#x27;. His rivalry with fellow Australian football legend Graham Farmer raised the standard of ruck play during the 1960s.

==Carlton career==
The Carlton Football Club recruited Nicholls from the Maryborough Football Club in 1957 after recruiting his elder brother, Don, the previous year their father ensured that both brothers would play together at one club. Don played 77 senior games as a centreman for Carlton from 1956, when he was Carlton&#x27;s best first-year player, to 1961.
Nicholls enjoyed an outstanding season in 1966, winning his second consecutive Robert Reynolds Trophy, and finishing second in the Brownlow Medal count, four votes behind St Kilda champion Ian Stewart.

===Success as captain-coach===
In his first year as captain-coach, Nicholls led the Blues to the minor premiership with 18 wins and a draw, followed by with 18 wins. 1972 was the first season in which the McIntyre &quot;Final Five&quot; system was used, and so because Carlton finished on top of the ladder, this meant that they had a week&#x27;s break before facing Richmond in the Second Semi-final. The match was drawn, which in those days meant that a replay was required the following week, thus shifting every other match back another week. Richmond won the replay by 41 points, but in the post-match interviews Nicholls refused to panic:
Carlton has not hit a form slump. We just had a dismal day – our worst for the season. [...] There&#x27;ll be no panic just because we went down by 41 points. There won&#x27;t be more than one or two changes. [...] We will be sticking to the same players because it was they who put us where we finished at the end of the home-and-away games. [...] I know the players will redeem themselves next week. We just won&#x27;t beat St. Kilda – we will win well. And if we team together as I know we can I know we are good enough to take the premiership.

Robert Walls, who was serving as vice-captain, recalled that the day after the semi-final defeat, the players arrived at training feeling flat, but Nicholls revealed to them the outline of his plan to win the premiership with all-out attacking football. But first, Carlton had to defeat in the Preliminary Final. The Saints had played in the previous year&#x27;s Grand Final and still boasted a strong team. Nicholls chose not to implement his plan, trusting that his players would get the job done. The Blues prevailed by 16 points and earned the right to redeem themselves against their arch-rival.&lt;br&gt;
Richmond went into the Grand Final as clear favourites, but this would be the day when Nicholls established once and for all his reputation as one of the greats of the game. The element of surprise in Nicholls&#x27; plan lay in his team selection; he handed the rucking responsibilities to &quot;Percy&quot; Jones, whilst stationing himself in the forward pocket with the intent of kicking goals. He also deployed Barry Armstrong in the centre while Vin Waite was given the task of minding Barry Richardson. Finally, in the lead-up to the match, Nicholls had given his players three simple instructions: get to the ball first, kick long into attack and contest for 100 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
The plan succeeded in the most spectacular fashion possible. In an enthralling spectacle of attacking football from both teams, Carlton piled on the goals to lead at half time with an incredible score of 18.6 (114) to 10.9 (69). The shell-shocked Tigers tried to claw their way back into the game, but every goal they scored was met with a Carlton reply. When the final siren sounded, Carlton had registered a record score of 28.9 (177) while Richmond&#x27;s score of 22.18 (150), enough to win most games, remains the highest losing score in a Grand Final. While every Carlton player contributed, Nicholls himself had a field day, kicking six goals on Ray Boyanich. He said afterwards that had he not kicked six, he felt he would have failed in the position. Walls, who also kicked six goals, was nominated best on ground. 

Stung by their defeat, Richmond didn&#x27;t have to wait long to avenge their humiliation as the two rivals squared off again in the following season&#x27;s Grand Final. On a hot and blustery day, Richmond prevailed in a match that would be remembered for two major incidents. The first occurred at the three-minute mark of the first quarter, when Nicholls was sensationally felled by Richmond back pocket Laurie Fowler while juggling a mark. Both players had their eyes on the ball and didn&#x27;t see each other until it was too late. Fowler, who was airborne, hit Nicholls with his shoulder and emerged from the collision unscathed, but Nicholls went to ground and had to be helped to his feet by the club trainers. The sight of their fallen leader stunned the Carlton players; Robert Walls recalled that &quot;[t]here was a bit of disbelief when Nicholls went down because we&#x27;d never seen the big bloke hurt like that before.&quot; Nicholls was awarded a 15-metre penalty, and goaled from the free kick, but suffered double vision from the collision, and had little further impact on the game.&lt;br&gt; The second incident came in the second quarter, when Ian Stewart kicked the ball deep into Richmond&#x27;s attacking zone to a contest involving Carlton full-back Geoff Southby and Richmond forward Neil Balme. What happened next would sour Carlton&#x27;s already bitter relations with Richmond for many years. Going for the ball after it spilled off a pack contest, Southby was floored by a round-arm punch from Balme. The hit broke Southby&#x27;s jaw, and he would not return to the field after half time. Just moments later, Balme would lash out again, this time at Vin Waite. 
Reflecting on the incident many years later, Nicholls angrily labelled Balme a &quot;cheat&quot;:
I didn&#x27;t respect him as a player because I reckon he was a cheat. He used to dwell on players and with his big, strong frame, he should have been doing more courageous things. People over the years say Balmey knocked a couple out, but he basically king-hit people.

===Controversies=== 
While playing for Carlton, Nicholls served a three-month jail term at Pentridge Prison in 1960, having been found guilty of embezzling £5,558 () from the Collins Street Branch of the ES&amp;A Bank and larceny as a servant. He was sentenced to twelve months&#x27; imprisonment (with an eligibility for parole after three months); he missed the first eleven games of the 1960 season, returning to play against Richmond on 16 July 1960.

===Retirement===
Nicholls retired with a Victorian elite football and Carlton club record of 328 games. Some publications list Nicholls as playing 331 games, by reason of a VFL/AFL ruling from 1969 that added three games for Carlton that Nicholls missed while playing interstate football for Victoria to his total: this ruling was rescinded by the VFL/AFL in 1996. 

Nicholls&#x27; Victorian elite football games record of 328 was broken by Kevin Murray in Round 18 of 1974 — Murray retired at the end of the 1974 season with 333 VFL/AFL games — while his Carlton club record remained until it was broken by Bruce Doull in Round 1 of 1985. 

====Other matches====
Nicholls also played 31 matches in interstate football for Victoria, and 17 pre-season/night series matches (which are counted as senior by the SANFL and WAFL but not the VFL/AFL). If these matches are included, Nicholls played a total of 376 senior career games.

The VFL/AFL lists Nicholls&#x27; total as 366, excluding his pre-season/night series matches but including seven International Rules matches he played on the 1967 and 1968 World Tours (which are counted as senior by the VFL/AFL): if his pre-season/night series matches are included here, Nicholls played an overall total of 383 senior career games.

Depending on the viewpoint taken:
*The VFL/AFL&#x27;s total of 366 was an elite Victorian football record until broken by Kevin Bartlett in Round 12 of 1981.
*If International Rules matches are excluded, Nicholls&#x27; total of 376 was an elite Victorian football record until broken by Bartlett in Round 20 of 1981.
*Including International Rules matches, Nicholls&#x27; overall total of 383 was an elite Victorian football record until broken by Bartlett in Round 2 of 1982.

===Coaching===
Following his retirement, he served as non-playing coach at Carlton in 1975, but then resigned three days before the start of the 1976 VFL season, citing mental and physical exhaustion. Nicholls then went to South Australia, where he coached Glenelg from 1977 to 1978, and then returned to Melbourne to coach Coburg in the VFA in 1981.

==Life after Football==
Nicholls has remained loyal to Carlton, even through the recent lean years.

In August 2010, at a function to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Carlton&#x27;s memorable 1970 premiership, Nicholls took the opportunity to voice his displeasure at the way Carlton had been run by previous administrators since the 1995 premiership, which eventually led, among other things, to the club&#x27;s first wooden spoon in 2002:
The thing that annoys me more at the moment about Carlton is our lack of respect, generally, in the footballing public. I know that, without going right through all the 50-odd years, I have seen a lot of good committees come and go. I have seen a lot of good players come and go, but there is a lack of respect and, to me, a trashing of the Carlton brand in the past 10 or 15 years.

During Carlton&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration in June 2014, at which he was named the club&#x27;s greatest player, Nicholls went further, saying that the club needed to lose its arrogant image:
But I must say, if I have one regret about the image of Carlton, who I love, it is the fact that we have probably taken over from Collingwood as being the most hated side in the league. I say that because people think we were arrogant, which we were – thanks to a couple of presidents. Without mentioning any names, they were arrogant. When we won, they didn&#x27;t know how to win properly. I believe that&#x27;s the thing about sport – you have got to know how to win and how to lose and do both properly. We were arrogant. I think that helped create an image of the club, being an arrogant club, which I don&#x27;t think we are.

==Honours and Tributes==
Nicholls won the Robert Reynolds Trophy for Carlton&#x27;s best and fairest player on five occasions: 1959, only his third season, and then in 1963, 1965, 1966 and 1967. In the eleven seasons from 1959 to 1969, Nicholls never placed outside the top three for the award. The trophy was renamed in Nicholls&#x27; honour in 2004. He was also named in Carlton&#x27;s Team of the Century in the first ruck.

Besides being named as one of the twelve inaugural &quot;Legends of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, Nicholls was also named in the AFL Team of the Century, as the resting ruckman in the back pocket, with Graham Farmer taking the first ruck position. He is depicted contesting a boundary throw-in against Farmer in Jamie Cooper&#x27;s painting &quot;the Game That Made Australia&quot;, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.

Teammate and fellow Hall of Fame Legend Alex Jesaulenko rated Nicholls the best he had seen or played with, &quot;because he could have two marks and four kicks and still win a game.&quot;

Former Collingwood captain Des Tuddenham said that Nicholls had the best football brain of anyone he had met.

Carlton rover Rod Ashman recounted the impact Nicholls had during his early years at the club: 
Playing alongside &quot;Big Nick&quot; was an absolute godsend. I got him at the end of his career, but I&#x27;ll never forget one day at Carlton at a boundary throw-in, right in front of the social club in the forward pocket. He looked at me and motioned towards a spot; it was clear he wanted me to get there. Sure enough, he palms it straight to me and I kick a goal. He was that good. Opposition ruckmen just couldn&#x27;t get around him. I couldn&#x27;t believe the size of his legs; they were enormous. He could manoeuvre around blokes like Polly Farmer, even though he stood only six feet two. that&#x27;s shorter than Chris Judd. He was just a sensational player.

<text>Stephen Goosson (March 24, 1889 - March 25, 1973) was an American film set designer and art director.
==Life==
Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Goosson studied architecture at Syracuse University. He worked as an architect in Detroit before moving to New York City in 1917 and studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Paris. He started his film career as art director for producer Lewis J. Selznick in 1919, and films for Fox Film Corporation such as &quot;New Movietone Follies of 1930&quot;. Gossoon made a name for himself working for Mary Pickford in 1921 when he invented new methods and materials for her film &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;. He eventually was hired by Columbia Pictures in 1931, where he served as supervising art director for 25 years.

Goosson was the principal designed for many of Frank Capra&#x27;s movies during Capra&#x27;s time at Columbia in the 1930s, including &quot;American Madness&quot;, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;. Besides his collaboration with Capra, Goosson&#x27;s most important film of the 1930s was the screwball comedy &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;.
==Career==
Goosson was nominated for an Academy Award for the El Brendel musical &quot;Just Imagine&quot; and eventually won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction for &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. His designs for the film have been noted as excellent examples of the Streamline Moderne style that reached the height of its popularity that year. Additional credits include &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot;, &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;, &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, and &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;. In 1937, he was elected the first president of the Society of Motion Picture Art Directors, the forerunner of the Art Directors Guild, and was elected for a second term in 1947; he was inducted into the Art Directors Guild Hall of Fame in 2007.

In the late 1940s, he created the designs for three significant &quot;film noirs&quot;: &quot;Gilda&quot; (1946), &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; (1947), and &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; (1948).

Goosson died of a stroke in Woodland Hills, California.

<doc id="709448" wikidata="Q957216" url="?curid=709448" title="Stephen M. Young">
<text>Stephen Marvin Young (May 4, 1889December 1, 1984) was an American lawyer, World War I veteran, journalist and politician from the U.S. state of Ohio. A member 
of the Democratic Party, he served two terms as a United States senator from Ohio from 1959 until 1971.

==Early life==
Young was born on May 4, 1889, in Norwalk, Ohio, the fourth and youngest child of Stephen Marvin Young and Isabella Margaret Wagner. He and his father (who was a judge in Huron County) were namesakes of his great-grandfather, Stephen Marvin (1797–1868), the first pioneer of Shelby, Ohio. He attended Kenyon College and Adelbert College.

Young received a law degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1911.

===Early political career===
Young served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1913 to 1917, and as an assistant prosecutor of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, from 1917 to 1918. During the World War I era, he served in the U.S. Army in field artillery. In 1919, he returned to the Cuyahoga County prosecutor&#x27;s office.

In 1922, Young ran for the office of attorney general of Ohio. He won the Democratic nomination, but lost in the general election to Charles Crabbe, garnering 744,693 votes to Crabbe&#x27;s 780,192. In 1930, he ran for the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio but lost in the Democratic primary to former Representative George White, who went on to win the governorship.

===House of Representatives and military service===
From 1931 to 1932, Young served on the Ohio Commission on Unemployment Insurance. In 1932, Young was elected to one of Ohio&#x27;s two at-large seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was re-elected to his seat in 1934. In 1936, instead of running for re-election to the House, Young ran for governor of Ohio again. This time, he lost the Democratic primary to incumbent governor Martin Davey, who succeeded George White (against whom Young had run in 1930). From 1937 to 1939, Young served as special counsel to the attorney general of Ohio.

In 1938, Young again sought election to an at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but he and fellow Democrat John McSweeney were defeated by two Republicans, George H. Bender and L. L. Marshall. In 1940, Young was again elected to one of the at-large House seats; Bender retained the other. Losing that race were Marshall and Democrat Francis W. Durbin. In 1942, Ohio was reduced to one at-large House seat, and Young failed in his re-election bid, losing to Bender.

Young served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946, entering as a major and being discharged as a lieutenant colonel. In 1945, during World War II, he served as the Allied Military Governor of the Province of Reggio Emilia in Italy. He returned to practicing law in Cleveland and Washington, D.C.

In 1948, Young was elected to the U.S. House for a fourth time, defeating his old adversary George H. Bender, but promptly lost his seat again to Bender in 1950. In 1956, Young ran for attorney general of Ohio, winning the Democratic nomination again but losing in the general election to Ohio House Speaker William Saxbe (who would later serve in the U.S. Senate, as well as U.S. Attorney General under Richard Nixon).

===U. S. senator===
In 1958, Young ran for the U.S. Senate against the Republican incumbent Senator John W. Bricker (who had been Thomas E. Dewey&#x27;s running mate in the 1944 U.S. presidential election). Bricker seemed invincible, but Young capitalized on widespread public opposition to the proposed &quot;right to work&quot; amendment to Ohio&#x27;s constitution, which Bricker had endorsed. Few thought that Young, who was 69 at the time, could win; even members of his own party had doubts, particularly Ohio&#x27;s other senator, Democrat Frank J. Lausche. In an upset, Young defeated Bricker. Young knew that Lausche had not supported him and, when he took the oath of office, refused to allow Lausche to stand with him. This broke with the Senate custom of a senior senator escorting the junior senator of his state to take the oath.

Young was very narrowly re-elected in 1964, defeating the Republican nominee, then-Representative Robert Taft Jr., who was the son of conservative icon Senator Robert A. Taft from Ohio and the grandson of William Howard Taft. He decided not to run for re-election to the Senate in 1970. In the 1970 U.S. Senate primary, Howard Metzenbaum was selected to replace Young, but Metzenbaum lost the general election to Taft, who was again the Republican nominee. In 1976, Metzenbaum won Young&#x27;s Senate seat back from Taft and held it for the Democratic Party until his retirement in 1995.

Young stood as a favorite son in the 1968 Ohio presidential primary. He did not enter any other primaries or stand as a candidate in his own right; he ultimately endorsed Hubert Humphrey.

In the Senate, Young was well known for his biting responses to abusive, offensive, or ignorant letters from constituents. On one occasion, he wrote, &quot;Dear Sir: It appears to me that you have been grossly misinformed, or are exceedingly stupid. Which is it?&quot; On another, he received a hostile letter that ended with the constituent&#x27;s phone number and the message, &quot;I would welcome the opportunity to have intercourse with you.&quot; Young wrote back, &quot;you sir, can have intercourse with yourself.&quot;

===Home and death===
Young lived in Washington, D.C., until his death on December 1, 1984. He was buried in Norwalk Cemetery, Norwalk, Ohio.

<doc id="709456" wikidata="Q529639" url="?curid=709456" title="Kay Boyle">
<text>Kay Boyle (February 19, 1902 – December 27, 1992) was an American novelist, short story writer, educator, and political activist. Boyle is best known for her fiction, which often explored the intersections of personal and political themes. Her work contributed significantly to modernist literature, and she was an active participant in the expatriate literary scene in Paris during the 1920s. She was a Guggenheim Fellow and O. Henry Award winner.

==Early years==
The granddaughter of a publisher, Boyle was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, and grew up in several cities but principally in Cincinnati, Ohio. She had one sibling, an elder sister, Joan (1900–1993), later Mrs. Detweiler. Their father, Howard Peterson Boyle, was a lawyer, and their mother was Katherine (Evans) Boyle, a literary and social activist who believed the wealthy had an obligation to help the financially less fortunate. In later years, Kay Boyle championed integration and civil rights. She advocated banning nuclear weapons, and American withdrawal from the Vietnam War.

Boyle was educated at the exclusive Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, then studied architecture at the Ohio Mechanics Institute in Cincinnati. Interested in the arts, she studied violin at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music before settling in New York City in 1922 where she found work as a writer/editor with a small magazine.

==Marriages and family life==
That same year, she met and married a French exchange student, Richard Brault, and they moved to France in 1923. This resulted in her staying in Europe for the better part of the next twenty years. Separated from her husband, she formed a relationship with magazine editor Ernest Walsh, with whom she had a daughter, Sharon, named for the Rose of Sharon, in March 1927, five months after Walsh&#x27;s death from tuberculosis in October 1926.

In 1928 she met Laurence Vail, who was then married to Peggy Guggenheim. Boyle and Vail lived together between 1929 until 1932 when, following their divorces, they married. With Vail, she had three more children - daughters Apple-Joan in 1929, Kathe in 1934, and Clover in 1939. During her years in France, Boyle was associated with several innovative literary magazines and made friends with many of the writers and artists living in Paris around Montparnasse. Among her friends were Harry and Caresse Crosby who owned the Black Sun Press and published her first work of fiction, a collection titled &quot;Short Stories&quot;. They became such good friends that in 1928 Harry Crosby cashed in some stock dividends to help Boyle pay for an abortion. Other friends included Eugene and Maria Jolas. Boyle also wrote for &quot;transition&quot;, one of the preeminent literary publications of the day. A poet as well as a novelist, her early writings often reflected her lifelong search for true love as well as her interest in the power relationships between men and women. Boyle&#x27;s short stories won two O. Henry Awards.

In 1936, she wrote a novel, &quot;Death of a Man&quot;, an attack on the growing threat of Nazism. In 1943, following her divorce from Laurence Vail, she married Baron Joseph von Franckenstein, with whom she had two children - Faith in 1942 and Ian in 1943. After having lived in France, Austria, England, and in Germany after World War II, Boyle returned to the United States.

==McCarthyism, later life==
In the States, Boyle and her husband were victims of early 1950s McCarthyism. Her husband was dismissed by Roy Cohn from his post in the Public Affairs Division of the United States Department of State, and Boyle lost her position as foreign correspondent for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, a post she had held for six years. She was blacklisted by most of the major magazines. During this period, her life and writing became increasingly political.

She and her husband were cleared by the United States Department of State in 1957.

In the early 1960s, Boyle and her husband lived in Rowayton, Connecticut, where he taught at a private girls&#x27; school. He was then rehired by the State Department and posted to Iran, but died shortly thereafter in 1963.

Boyle was a writer in residence at the New York City Writer&#x27;s Conference at Wagner College in 1962. In 1963, she accepted a creative writing position on the faculty of San Francisco State College, where she remained until 1979.

During this period she became heavily involved in political activism. She traveled to Cambodia in 1966 as part of the &quot;Americans Want to Know&quot; fact-seeking mission. She participated in protests, and in 1967 was arrested twice and imprisoned. In 1968, she signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. In her later years, she became an active supporter of Amnesty International and worked for the NAACP. After retiring from San Francisco State College, Boyle briefly held writer-in-residence positions, including at Eastern Washington University in Cheney and the University of Oregon in Eugene.

She was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

Boyle died at a retirement community in Mill Valley, California on December 27, 1992.

==Legacy==
In her lifetime Kay Boyle published more than 40 books, including 14 novels, eight volumes of poetry, 11 collections of short fiction, three children&#x27;s books, and French to English translations and essays. Most of her papers and manuscripts are in the Morris Library at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois. Morris Library has the Ruby Cohn Collection of Kay Boyle Letters and the Alice L. Kahler Collection of Kay Boyle Letters. A comprehensive assessment of Boyle&#x27;s life and work was published in 1986 titled &quot;Kay Boyle, Artist and Activist&quot; by Sandra Whipple Spanier. In 1994 Joan Mellen published a voluminous biography of Kay Boyle, &quot;Kay Boyle: Author of Herself&quot;.

A member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, in addition to her two O. Henry Awards, she received two Guggenheim Fellowships and in 1980 received the National Endowment for the Arts fellowship for &quot;extraordinary contribution to American literature over a lifetime of creative work&quot;.

<text>The Rim of the Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC) is the world&#x27;s largest international maritime warfare exercise. RIMPAC is held ly during June and July of even-numbered years from Honolulu, Hawaii, with the exception of 2020 where it was held in August. It is hosted and administered by the United States Navy&#x27;s Indo-Pacific Command, headquartered at Pearl Harbor, in conjunction with the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, and Hawaii National Guard forces under the control of the Governor of Hawaii.

==Participants==

The first RIMPAC, held in 1971, involved forces from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Australia, Canada, and the US have participated in every RIMPAC since then. Other regular participants are Chile, Colombia, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. The Royal New Zealand Navy was frequently involved until the 1985 ANZUS nuclear ships dispute and was subsequently absent, until returning to take part in more recent RIMPACs since 2012.

While not contributing any ships, observer nations are involved in RIMPAC at the strategic level and use the opportunity to prepare for possible full participation in the future.

The United States contingent has included an aircraft carrier strike group, submarines, up to a hundred aircraft and 20,000 Sailors, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and their respective officers. The size of the exercises varies from year to year.

In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, both houses of the US Congress have called for a Taiwanese participation of RIMPAC 2022 in the face of &quot;increasingly coercive and aggressive behavior&quot; by China.

== By year ==

As discussed previously, the first RIMPAC was in 1971.
=== RIMPAC 1988 ===

RIMPAC &#x27;88 took place in June 1988, and involved the navies of Japan, Australia, Canada and the United States, as well United States Air Force B-52s.

Two US battle groups staged out of Pearl Harbor for the exercise: The USS Nimitz carrier battle group and the USS Missouri battleship battle group.

Following routine training exercises to enhance the multinational forces&#x27; abilities to operate together, the two battle groups were split into opposing forces and a pre-set war game scenario was put into action.

The Missouri battle group, with USS Long Beach, HMAS Darwin, HMAS Hobart and other escort and supply ships, assumed the role of &quot;aggressor&quot; and conducted an imaginary takeover of the friendly island of &quot;Wombat&quot; (a fictitious name given to the island of Lanai, as part of the war game exercise).

The USS Nimitz carrier battle group, accompanied by at least one submarine as well as Japanese and Canadian Navy frigates and destroyers, were then sortied from Pearl Harbor in order to &quot;rescue&quot; Wombat from the aggressor force.

Soviet intelligence &quot;trawlers&quot; constantly sailed the waters near the entrance of Pearl Harbor during the exercise, &quot;fishing&quot; for radio transmissions and trying to follow warships as they left the harbor. Thus, the US Navy would often sortie many more ships than those needed to participate in the exercise, enticing the trawlers to follow them to sea. After the participating ships left harbor, the decoy fleet would then lead the Soviet trawlers back to Pearl Harbor, leaving the Soviet captains wondering where the carriers and battleships went.

The much larger carrier battle group eventually &quot;won&quot; the exercise, as was expected, and peace loving &quot;Wombat&quot; was liberated. But testing and perfecting the joint interoperability of the various nation&#x27;s navies was the ultimate goal. To this end, neither side &quot;lost&quot;.

=== RIMPAC 1992 ===
RIMPAC 1992 took place between 19 June and 2 August 1992. Among the vessels&#x27; taking part was the aircraft carrier , which was assigned to Battle Force X-Ray which also included ten Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) vessels (including the submarine ).

During the exercise, a minor incident occurred when on 13 July 1992, a Qantas Boeing 747-400 flying from Los Angeles to Sydney inadvertently entered into the exercise&#x27;s area near Hawaii. The aircraft&#x27;s crew soon overheard a radio warning from the cruiser that &#x27;hostile action&#x27; would be taken against any United States Air Force (USAF) aircraft (playing the role of the pretend aggressor) attempting to enter the &quot;Cowpens&quot;&#x27; defensive area. The message was accidentally broadcast on the International Air Distress Frequency instead of the internal military radio network, leading to the 747 obeying the warning and leaving the area (despite the airliner not being in any danger). This led to the US apologizing to the Australian Government. A Qantas spokesperson stated that the flight was only delayed by 19 minutes.

=== RIMPAC 1994 ===
RIMPAC 1994 involved 57 vessels, and more than 200 aircraft from the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Canada each taking part in the exercise. These included and her carrier battle group, battlegroup, the amphibious ready group and the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;″s battlegroup. The exercise&#x27;s boundaries that year reached as far west as Midway Island. During the exercise, the &quot;Independence&quot;″s air wing (CVW-5) conducted war-at-sea strikes against the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, with the support of Japanese and US vessels.

=== RIMPAC 1996 ===

RIMPAC 1996 involved more than 48 ships and 200 aircraft. Among these vessels were the US carriers &quot;Independence,&quot; &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; and their respective carrier battle groups. Like in RIMPAC &#x27;94, the &quot;Independence&quot; conducted air operations against the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; battle group.

This exercise was notable for the accidental shooting down of a US Navy aircraft by a JMSDF vessel. On 3 June 1996, an A-6E SWIP Intruder from VA-115 (&quot;NF-500&quot;, BuNo 155704) based on board the &quot;Independence&quot; was shot down around west of Hawaii by CWIS fire from .

At the time of the incident (4:15PM) in clear skies, the Intruder was at towing a target for &quot;Yūgiri&quot; to shoot down. The radar aboard the destroyer instead locked on to the radar signature of the Intruder and thus fired on it. The engines caught fire with the hydraulics seizing up before the crew safely ejected. Initially thought to be a mechanical it was later determined to be human error.

RIMPAC 1996 was also the first time that the Chilean Navy would be involved in the exercise.

=== RIMPAC 2000 ===
From 30 May until 6 July 2000, RIMPAC 2000 took place near Hawaii under the command of Vice Adm. Dennis McGinn. It included the naval forces of Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Over 50 ships, 200 aircraft, and 22,000 personnel participated in the exercise. RIMPAC 2000 encompassed a large combined-arms operation involving a number of land, sea, and air assets. The scale of the exercise was used to test the new Coalition-Wide Area Network (C-WAN), which connected all of the ships involved with the designated command ship of the exercise, USS Coronado.

Training operations during RIMPAC 2000 included surface warfare, amphibious landing operations, a sinking exercise (SINKEX), air operations, and the first humanitarian exercise in the history of RIMPAC.

=== RIMPAC 2010 ===

On 23 June 2010, U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Patrick M. Walsh and Combined Task Force commander Vice Admiral Richard W. Hunt announced the official start of the month-long 2010 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise during a press conference held in Lockwood Hall at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam. RIMPAC 2010 was the 22nd exercise in the series that originated in 1971. The exercise was designed to increase the operational and tactical proficiency of participating units in a wide array of maritime operations by enhancing military-to-military relations and interoperability. 32 ships, 5 submarines, over 170 aircraft, and 20,000 personnel participated in RIMPAC 2010, the world&#x27;s largest multi-national maritime exercise.

RIMPAC 2010 brought together units and personnel from Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Peru, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. During the exercise, participating countries conducted gunnery, missile, anti-submarine, and air defense exercises, as well as maritime interdiction and vessel boarding, explosive ordnance disposal, diving and salvage operations, mine clearance operations, and an amphibious landing. RIMPAC 2010 will also emphasize littoral operations with ships like the U.S. littoral combat ship , the French frigate , and the Singaporean RSS &quot;Supreme&quot;.

On 28 June 2010, the aircraft carrier arrived in Pearl Harbor to participate in RIMPAC 2010. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was the only aircraft carrier to participate in this exercise. During the in-port phase of RIMPAC, officers and crew of the 14 participating navies interact in receptions, meetings, and athletic events. &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; completed its Tailored Ships Training Availability (TSTA) exercises prior to RIMPAC 2010.

During 6–7 July 2010, 32 naval vessels and five submarines from seven nations departed Pearl Harbor to participate in Phase II of RIMPAC 2010. This phase included live fire gunnery and missile exercises; maritime interdiction and vessel boardings; and anti-surface warfare, undersea warfare, naval maneuvers and air defense exercises. Participants also collaborated in explosive ordnance disposal; diving and salvage operations; mine clearance operations; and amphibious operations. Phase III involved scenario-driven exercises designed to further strengthen maritime skills and capabilities.

During RIMPAC 2010, over 40 naval personnel from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Chile, Peru, and Colombia managed combat exercises while serving aboard &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; (pictured). This involved managing anti-submarine warfare and surface warfare for Carrier Strike Group Seven and the entire RIMPAC force, including the use of radar, charts, and high-tech devices to monitor, chart, and communicate with other ships and submarines. Tactical action officers from the different countries coordinated the overall operational picture and provided direction and administration to the enlisted personnel involved in the Sea Combat Control (SCC) activities. Also, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; conducted a live Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launch, firing at a simulated target, the first since 2007.

On 30 July 2010, RIMPAC 2010 concluded with a press conference held at Merry Point Landing on Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam. A reception for over 1,500 participants, distinguished visitors and special guests was held in the hangar bays of the carrier &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;.

During RIMPAC 2010, participating countries conducted three sinking exercises (SINKEX) involving 140 discrete live-fire events that included 30 surface-to-air engagements, 40 air-to-air missile engagements, 12 surface-to-surface engagements, 76 laser-guided bombs, and more than 1,000 rounds of naval gunfire from 20 surface combatant warships. Units flew more than 3100 air sorties, completed numerous maritime interdiction and vessel boardings, explosive ordnance disposal, diving and salvage operations and mine clearance operations and 10 major experiments, with the major one being the U.S. Marine Corps Enhanced Company Operations experiment. Ground forces from five countries completed five amphibious landings, including nine helicopter-borne amphibious landings and 560 troops from ship-to-shore mission. In all, 960 different training events were scheduled, and 96 percent were completed in all areas of the Hawaiian operations area, encompassing Kāneʻohe Bay, Bellows Air Force Station, the Pacific Missile Range Facility, and the Pohakuloa Training Area.

=== RIMPAC 2012 ===

RIMPAC 2012 is the 23rd exercise in the series and started on 29 June 2012. 42 ships, including the aircraft carrier and other elements of Carrier Strike Group 11, six submarines, 200 aircraft and 25,000 personnel from 22 nations took part in Hawaii. The exercise involved surface combatants from the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Chile. The US Navy demonstrated its &#x27;Great Green Fleet&#x27; of biofuel-driven vessels for which it purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuel, the largest single purchase of biofuel in history at a cost of $12m. On 17 July, delivered 900,000 gallons of biofuel and traditional petroleum-based fuel to &quot;Nimitz&quot;″s Carrier Strike Group 11.

The exercises included units or personnel from Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga, the United Kingdom and the United States. Russia participated actively for the first time, as did the Philippines, reportedly due to the escalating tensions with the People&#x27;s Republic of China over ownership of Scarborough Shoal.

RIMPAC 2012 marked the debut of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s new P-8A Poseidon land-based anti-submarine patrol aircraft, with two P-8As participating in 24 RIMPAC exercise scenarios as part of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron One (VX-1) based at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay.

The 2012 movie &quot;Battleship&quot; is about two &quot;Arleigh-Burke&quot;-class destroyers (USS &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; and USS &quot;Sampson&quot;) and one Japanese &quot;Kongō&quot;-class destroyer (JS &quot;Myoko&quot;) discovering an alien armada during RIMPAC 2012.

===RIMPAC 2014===


RIMPAC 2014 was the 24th exercise in the series and took place from 26 June to 1 August, with an opening reception on 26 June and a closing reception on 1 August.

For the first time, the Royal Norwegian Navy actively participated in the exercise. Norway sent one and possibly Norwegian marine special forces. China was also invited to send ships from their People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy; marking not only the first time China participated in a RIMPAC exercise, but also the first time China participated in a large-scale United States-led naval drill. On 9 June 2014, China confirmed it would be sending four ships to the exercise, a destroyer, frigate, supply ship, and hospital ship.

The year&#x27;s RIMPAC participants were Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Tonga, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Thailand was uninvited from the exercise following a 22 May military coup. Thailand&#x27;s absence means that 22 nations participated in RIMPAC instead of the 23 that had been advertised. The exercise involved 55 vessels, more than 200 aircraft, and some 25,000 personnel.

China&#x27;s 2014 participation in RIMPAC was its first.

=== RIMPAC 2016 ===


India participated in RIMPAC 2016.

In April 2016, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was also invited to RIMPAC 2016 despite the tension in the South China Sea.

=== RIMPAC 2018 ===

In January 2018, China announced that it had been invited. On 23 May 2018, however, the Pentagon announced that it had &quot;disinvited&quot; China because of recent militarization of islands in the South China Sea. The PRC has previously attended RIMPAC Exercises on 2014 and 2016.

On 30 May 2018, the US Navy announced that about 25,000 naval personnel and 52 ships and submarines from 26 countries will participate.

In this edition of RIMPAC, the Chilean Navy was responsible for leading the naval exercise, being the first non-English-speaking Navy to carry out this task. The election of Chile as leader of the Task Groups is a recognition of the high performance achieved in recent editions and the quality of its personnel, which since its first participation in 1996 has been demonstrating its preparation and professionalism.

Israel, Vietnam and Sri Lanka made their debut in RIMPAC. Brazil was due to make its debut too but cancelled its participation for the second time. The exercise also included a live firing of the AGM-158C LRASM (Long Range Anti-Ship Missile) for the first time.

=== RIMPAC 2020 ===

On 29 April 2020, the US Navy announced RIMPAC would be held from 17 to 30 August. It would be an at-sea-only event because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-five (25) nations have been invited to participate. Israel was among the original 25 invited nations, but declined to attend due to the pandemic. There has been some opposition to New Zealand&#x27;s participation and there have been calls from peace activists for New Zealand not to attend. The Philippines sent its first missile-capable frigate on its maiden voyage, which was only commissioned into service 10 July 2020, as its &quot;shakedown cruise&quot; where its performance would be tested by the crew in the two-week exercises.

On 17 August 2020, the US Navy announced that participation has scaled down to 10 nations, 22 ships, one submarine, and approximately 5,300 personnel, all at sea. These are the following navies that would take part in the exercise:

On 29 August 2020, forces began firing on former , a &quot;Charleston&quot;-class amphibious cargo vessel that was decommissioned in 1994. The US Navy and partner nations wrapped up the biennial RIMPAC 2020 exercise over the weekend with the sinking of the decommissioned amphibious cargo vessel.

=== RIMPAC 2022 ===

RIMPAC 2022 was held in the summer of that year, between 29 June and 4 August. It was expected to be a more traditional RIMPAC with the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions.

On 23 February 2022, it was announced that 27 countries are expected to take part. On 14 April 2022, it was announced that Canada would send four warships to participate. The same day, Peru announced that the corvette BAP &quot;Guise&quot; would also take part.

On 1 June 2022, a total of 26 countries have confirmed to take part at Exercise RIMPAC 2022, with the list as follows: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, the United Kingdom, and the United States (being 11 countries in Asia, 5 countries in Europe, 4 countries in South America, 3 countries in North America and 3 countries in Oceania).

=== RIMPAC 2024 ===
RIMPAC 2024 included ships and personnel from 29 countries. It is reported that the decommissioned ship was used in a sinking exercise as part of Exercise RIMPAC 2024. The U.S. Navy also officially unveiled the AIM-174B air-to-air missile, an &quot;Air-Launched Configuration&quot; of the RIM-174 Standard ERAM surface-to-air missile. The AIM-174 is the first dedicated long-range air-to-air missile fielded by the U.S. military since the Navy&#x27;s retirement of the AIM-54 Phoenix.

==Experiments==

RIMPAC experiments have included a range of sectors important to international militaries. In RIMPAC 2000, for example, the first of the Strong Angel international humanitarian response demonstrations were held on the Big Island of Hawai&#x27;i near Pu&#x27;u Pa&#x27;a. That series continued with events in the summer of 2004 and again in 2006.

Participants have also conducted exercises in ship-sinking and torpedo usage. They also have tested new naval vessels and technology. For example, in 2004, the United States Navy tested the Australian-built , a experimental wave-piercing catamaran that draws only of water, has a top speed of almost , and can transport 605 tons of cargo.

<text>The Nestucca River flows for about through forests near the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains a timber-producing area of the Northern Oregon Coast Range west of Portland.

Rising in the mountains of western Yamhill County, it is impounded near its headwaters to create McGuire Reservoir, the primary water source for the city of McMinnville. The river flows generally west through Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land and the Siuslaw National Forest, past Beaver, then southwest past Hebo and Cloverdale. It enters Nestucca Bay, on the Pacific Ocean, from the north at Pacific City. The Little Nestucca River does not join the Nestucca but enters Nestucca Bay from the south.

==Recreation==
Madelynne Sheehan in &quot;Fishing in Oregon&quot; calls the Nestucca River &quot;a real gem of an all-around stream.&quot; Anglers can fish for spring chinook salmon, fall chinook, coho salmon, coastal cutthroat trout, and steelhead. Winter steelhead on this river average , while summer steelhead of can sometimes appear &quot;almost nose to tail throughout a section of the river&quot;.

Bank access to the lower river is limited because much of the land is privately owned, but the stream, which is wide on the lower reaches, is often fished from boats. Cloverdale, Farmer Creek, Three Rivers, and Pacific City have public boat ramps, and there are less formal put-in places upriver. Upstream of Moon Creek, more than half of the land along the river is publicly owned, is managed by the Siuslaw National Forest and the BLM, and includes five campgrounds. The upper river between Moon Creek and Elk Creek is fished mainly for winter steelhead, and no fishing is allowed upstream of Elk Creek.

An stretch of the upper river between Rocky Bend Campground and Blaine offers whitewater canoeing and kayaking possibilities when the flow is about . The first of the run include a class 4 rapid followed by a class 5 and another class 4. An alternate put-in is available at a log bridge downstream of the second class 4. Below the bridge, class 2 and 3 whitewater continues for the remaining of the run.

<text>The Little Nestucca River is a river, approximately long, on the Pacific coast of northwest Oregon in the United States. It drains an area of the Central Oregon Coast Range west of the Willamette Valley.

It rises in the Van Duzer State Forest in northwestern Polk County, in the mountains west of Salem. It flows generally northwest, through the Siuslaw National Forest and enters Nestucca Bay on the Pacific near Pacific City. The Little Nestucca River crosses under the U.S. Route 101 just three miles south of Pacific City and is paralleled for much of its length by County Road 130.

It enters Nestucca Bay at the south end, independently of the Nestucca River which enters from the north end. They flow approximately parallel, and at their nearest, are about two and a half miles apart.

==Fishing==

The Little Nestucca River offers steelhead. A few stray hatchery steelhead are present throughout the winter season. Wild fish may be caught and released through the winter, with the run peaking in March. Limited public access is available along Little Nestucca River Road between Highway 22 and Highway 101.

The Little Nestucca River joins the Nestucca River from the south just before it flows into the Pacific Ocean. Only the headwaters are in public ownership—being managed by the Forest Service—with most of the primary fishing areas located on private lands. The river offers some boat fishing opportunities with a boat ramp located at the Highway 101 bridge. Most people fish for coho salmon and steelhead in the fall and winter. The river also features coastal cutthroat trout.

==Upton Falls==

Upton Falls was historically the upstream limit of migration for native fish, but the falls have been altered to include a fish ladder and a small embankment dam to divert the water to the ladder. There is a swimming hole downstream of the falls. The waterfall was originally most likely similar to Stella Falls, located a mile upstream.

The falls apparently were named for James B. Upton, a nearby homesteader who owned and operated a farm in the area.

Upton Falls is adjacent to the Little Nestucca Highway, just over three miles inland from Highway 101. The falls are clear to westbound traffic. Parking is available for only a few cars. Scramble paths lead down from the road to the river, but they are steep and generally unstable.

==Stella Falls==

Stella Falls (also known as Estella Falls) is the upper of two small waterfalls along the lower stretch of the Little Nestucca River. The falls consist of a cascading chute which rumbles into a deep trough-like gorge, bypassed by a fish ladder. The falls remain in their original state. The area just downstream has a popular swimming hole and is popular for fishing as well.

Stella Falls occurs adjacent to the Little Nestucca Highway, just less than four miles inland from Highway 101. A large pool precedes the gorge. Ample parking is available along the road, and fishing access paths lead to the rocks adjacent to the river for views upstream and down.

Width: Height: 10 feet

<text>Cape Lookout is a sharp rocky promontory along the Pacific Ocean coast of northwestern Oregon in the United States. It is located in southwestern Tillamook County, approximately southwest of Tillamook, just south of Netarts Bay. The promontory extends perpendicular to the coast, and is approximately wide at its base, tapering as it extends outward from the coast. Cape Lookout State Park is located on the north side of the promontory, which is part of the Siuslaw National Forest. Cape Lookout Road travels past the base of the cape. Cape Lookout is a member of Tillamook&#x27;s Three Capes Scenic Drive.

The Cape Lookout Trail is a popular hiking trail, extending through Sitka spruce forest to the tip of the promontory. The cliff-top hiking trail offers views of Cape Kiwanda and Cascade Head to the south as well as Cape Meares, Three Arch Rocks, and Neahkahnie Mountain to the north. Migrating whales can also be seen, generally from December through June, as they pass the end of the cape.

The cape was named on July 6, 1788 by British fur trader John Meares, who was sailing south from Nootka Island, Canada in search of trade. During World War II, the cape was the location of a notable crash of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. There was one survivor (the bombardier), Wilbur L. Perez. A plaque on the cape memorializes the victims of the crash, which occurred in 1943.

<doc id="709487" wikidata="Q1857886" url="?curid=709487" title="Hesperis matronalis">
<text>Hesperis matronalis is an herbaceous flowering plant species in the family Brassicaceae. It has numerous common names, including dame&#x27;s rocket, damask-violet, dame&#x27;s-violet, dames-wort, dame&#x27;s gilliflower, night-scented gilliflower, queen&#x27;s gilliflower, rogue&#x27;s gilliflower, sweet rocket, and mother-of-the-evening.

These plants are biennials or short-lived perennials, native to Eurasia and cultivated in many other areas of the world for their attractive, spring-blooming flowers. In some of those areas, it has escaped from cultivation and become a weed species. The genus name &quot;Hesperis&quot; was probably given because the scent of the flowers becomes more conspicuous towards evening (&quot;Hespera&quot; is the Greek word for evening).

==Description==
&quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot; grows 100 cm or taller, with multiple upright, hairy stems. Typically, the first year of growth produces a mound of foliage, and flowering occurs the second year; the plants are normally biennials, but a number of races can be short-lived perennials. The plants have showy blooms in early to mid spring. The leaves are alternately arranged on upright stems and lanceolate-shaped; they typically have very short petioles (or lack them) and have toothed margins, but sometimes are entire and are widest at the base. The foliage has short hairs on the top and bottom surfaces that give the leaves a somewhat rough feel. The larger leaves are around 12 cm long and over 4 cm wide. In early spring, a thick mound of low-growing foliage is produced; during flowering the lower parts of the stems are generally unbranched and denuded of foliage and the top of the blooming plant might have a few branches that end in inflorescences.

The plentiful, fragrant flowers are produced in large, showy, terminal racemes that can be 30+ cm tall and elongate as the flowers of the inflorescence bloom. When stems have both flowers and fruits, the weight sometimes causes the stems to bend. Each flower is large (2 cm across), with four petals. Flower coloration varies, with different shades of lavender and purple most common, but white, pink, and even some flowers with mixed colors exist in cultivated forms. A few different double-flowered varieties also exist. The four petals are clawed and hairless. The flowers have six stamens in two groups, the four closest to the ovary are longer than the two oppositely positioned. Stigmas are two-lobed. The four sepals are erect and form a mock tube around the claws of the petals and are also colored similarly to the petals.

Some plants may bloom until August, but warm weather greatly shortens the duration on each flower&#x27;s blooming. Seeds are produced in thin fruits 5–14 cm long pods, containing two rows of seeds separated by a dimple. The fruit are and open by way of valves, constricted between the seeds like a pea pod. Seeds are oblong, 3–4 mm long and 1–1.5 mm wide.

In North America, &quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot; is often confused with native &quot;Phlox&quot; species that have similar large showy flower clusters. They can be distinguished from each other by foliage and flower differences: dame&#x27;s rocket has alternately arranged leaves and four petals per flower, while phloxes have opposite leaves and five petals.


==Taxonomy==
&quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot; was given its modern scientific name by Carl Linnaeus in his book Species Plantarum in 1753.

===Names===
The genus name, &quot;Hesperis&quot;, means &quot;of the evening&quot;, possibly referring to the strong fragrance of the flowers late in the day. The species name, &quot;matronalis&quot;, means &quot;of older married women&quot;.

One of the most frequently used names for this species is &quot;sweet rocket&quot;. Though the name violet is strongly associated with &quot;Viola&quot; genus, in the past it was widely applied to other flowers including this species as &quot;Damask violet&quot; in English and &quot;Viola Damascena&quot; in Latin, both referring to the city of Damascus in Syria. The French name &quot;Violette de Damas&quot; also refers to Damascus, but was mistaken for &quot;dames&quot; giving rise to the common name &quot;dame&#x27;s violet&quot;. The variant &quot;dame&#x27;s gilliflower&quot; comes from this earlier name. The name &quot;queen&#x27;s gilliflower&quot; was a very popular name for the flower in the 16th century, possibly as a way to honor Queen Elizabeth I. Later the &quot;rogue&#x27;s gilliflower&quot; or &quot;queen&#x27;s rogues&quot; may have originally been &quot;rouge&quot;, and therefore meaning red gilliflower. In America the dame&#x27;s violet became &quot;dame&#x27;s rocket&quot;, combining dame with the common English name for several cabbage family plants, &quot;rocket&quot;, from the French &quot;roquette&quot; (&quot;Eruca vesicaria&quot;).

In 1769 John Hill&#x27;s Family Herbal called it &quot;eveweed&quot;, yet another reference to its nighttime scent along with &quot;night-smelling rocket&quot;, &quot;vesper flower&quot;, and &quot;mother-of-the-evening&quot;. The double cultivar is called &quot;whitsun gilliflower&quot; while the standard species is occasionally called &quot;whitsun gillies&quot; in Warwickshire. The names &quot;close sciences&quot; and &quot;coses sciences&quot; are a modification of the Devonshire name &quot;sciney&quot; which in turn comes from the older Latin name &quot;damascene&quot; used for the plant. Other English names include &quot;dames wort&quot; and &quot;red rocket&quot;.

It shares the name &quot;summer lilac&quot; with &quot;Buddleia davidii&quot;. The name &quot;winter gilliflower&quot; is much more often applied to &quot;Cheiranthus cheiri&quot; or &quot;Galanthus nivalis&quot; (snowdrops), but it is rarely applied to sweet rocket. With many other plants like &quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot; it is named as &quot;motherwort&quot;, though very seldomly.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot; has been a cultivated species for a long time, and grows best in full sun to partial shade where soils are moist with good drainage. It is undemanding and self-seeds quickly, forming dense stands. Extensive monotypic stands of dame&#x27;s rocket are visible from great distances; these dense collections of plants have the potential to crowd out native species when growing outside of cultivated areas.

The successful spread of dame&#x27;s rocket in North America is attributed to its prolific seed production and because the seeds are often included in prepackaged &quot;wildflower seed&quot; mixes sold for &quot;naturalizing&quot;. The plants typically produce a low-lying rosette of foliage the first year; in subsequent years, blooming and seed production occurs in tandem throughout the blooming season. This species is commonly found in roadside ditches, dumps and in open woodland settings, where it is noticed when in bloom. Although it makes an attractive, hardy garden plant, it has been found to be ecologically invasive in North America.

&quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot; is propagated by seeds, but desirable individuals, including the double-flowering forms, are propagated from cuttings or division of the clumps.

== Culinary use ==
Young leaves are high in vitamin C, slightly bitter, and can be eaten in salads or cooked. They are available in the winter months in temperate climates, when few other greens are available. The tender shoots of the plant during the spring-time, when cooked, are considered an excellent vegetable. The flower buds are eaten as well, and the flowers used for their spicy flavor and bright color. Additionally, the seeds of the plant can be sprouted and eaten in salads.

==Distribution==

&quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot; is native to southern Europe from Spain to Turkey, and has been introduced to many other parts of the world with temperate climates. &quot;H. matronalis&quot; is found in many areas of Ireland, including Belfast, as a garden escape.

Dame&#x27;s rocket was brought to North America in the 17th century and has since become naturalized there, now growing throughout most of the US and Canada. The US Department of Agriculture website has a map showing states and provinces in which the plant has been found.

In Europe, it is host to the caterpillars of several butterfly species, including the orange tip (&quot;Anthocharis cardamines&quot;), large white (&quot;Pieris brassicae&quot;), small white (&quot;Pieris rapae&quot;), and moths, such as &quot;Plutella porrectella&quot;.

==Weediness==

It is considered an invasive species in some areas. Five U.S. states have placed legal restrictions on it:
* In Colorado, it is classed as a noxious weed (B-list), with plans for eradication or management varying by area and year.
* In Connecticut, it is classified as invasive and banned, making it illegal to move, sell, purchase, transplant, cultivate, or distribute the plant.
* In Massachusetts, it is prohibited.
* In New York, it is classified as invasive and eradication considered infeasible.
* In Wisconsin, it is classed as restricted, i.e. an invasive species that is already widely established in the state, and causes, or has the potential to cause significant environmental or economic harm.

In Alberta, Canada, it is considered a noxious weed, meaning its growth or spread needs to be prevented.

<text>&quot;The Protestant Sects and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (German: &quot;Die protestantischen Sekten und der Geist des Kapitalismus&quot;) is an essay written by Max Weber.

==Summary==
The essay is based on Weber&#x27;s observations of American businessmen in 1904, during a trip he took to visit relatives in Ohio and North Carolina, and to do research in the libraries of American universities that had Protestant affiliations. Despite the strict Separation of Church and State in the US, businessmen never failed to ask (casually) about each other&#x27;s religious affiliations. Weber eventually realized that this odd custom (from a European point of view) acted as a kind of &quot;credit check&quot;.

This worked for two reasons. First, membership in a Protestant sect was voluntary (unlike the state-sponsored Churches in Europe), and they only accepted members who had demonstrated a certain standard of behavior. Any member who failed to behave as expected would face pressure to reform, or lose his membership. Therefore, any member in good standing could be trusted in business (regardless of which sect he belonged to).

Second, the Protestant sects were run by their members, and the pastor was their employee (unlike state-sponsored Churches, where the pastor might be a political appointee). If a pastor became lax or corrupt, the members could replace him. s also insisted that their pastors should preach ethics, rather than the finer points of religious dogma (which they considered to be less important than ethical behavior).

As the influence of religion declined (particularly in the larger cities), this function had been taken up by secular businessmen&#x27;s organizations. Again, these organizations only accepted members who demonstrated a certain standard of behavior, and that standard was enforced by the members rather than the hierarchy. Traveling salesmen would always be sure to wear a lapel pin indicating membership in one organization or another, because without such an affiliation, people wouldn&#x27;t trust them. Joining such an organization was often a sign that an immigrant was becoming assimilated into American culture.

Both the religious and secular versions of this phenomenon were already dying out in the larger cities. In his book &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;, Weber theorized that having a large number of businessmen who could be counted on to behave ethically was important to the growth of Capitalism, and that this had its origins in the Protestant Reformation (particularly in Calvinism and its spiritual descendants), although it had later become secularized.

<text>The &quot;Objectivity&quot; of Knowledge in Social Science and Social Policy () is a 1904 essay written by Max Weber, a German economist and sociologist, originally published in German in the 1904 issues of the &quot;Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialforschung&quot;.

The objectivity essay discusses essential concepts of Weber&#x27;s sociology: &quot;ideal type,&quot; &quot;(social) action,&quot; &quot;empathic understanding,&quot; &quot;imaginary experiment,&quot; &quot;value-free analysis,&quot; and &quot;objectivity of sociological understanding&quot;.

With his objectivity essay, Weber pursued two goals. On the one hand, he wanted to outline the research program of the &quot;Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialforschung&quot; from his point of view, in particular its position on the question of non-judgmental science. On the other hand, Weber dealt with the question of how objectively valid truths are possible in the field of cultural sciences.

<text>Anthony Joseph &quot;Tony&quot; Celebrezze Jr. (September 8, 1941 – July 4, 2003) was an American politician of the Democratic party, who served as Ohio Attorney General, Ohio Secretary of State and an Ohio State Senator. He was the son of Anthony J. Celebrezze, and part of the Celebrezze political dynasty, which was prominent in Cleveland in particular and statewide in Ohio throughout the second half of the 20th century and early 2000s.

==Early life and education==
Anthony Joseph Celebrezze was born to Anthony J. Celebrezze and Anne M. Celebrezze in 1941. Tony was the oldest of three, along with sisters Jean Ann (Celebrezze) Porto, and Susan Marie (Celebrezze) Sullivan.

Anthony Joseph Celebrezze graduated from John Marshall High School in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1963, Tony graduated from the United States Naval Academy. Tony served in the United States Navy for five years and was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal. In 1974, Anthony Joseph Celebrezze was awarded a Juris Doctor degree from Cleveland State University.

==Political career==
===Ohio state senator===
Anthony Joseph Celebrezze was elected an Ohio state senator in 1974. While in the Ohio General Assembly, Tony was known for his honesty and fair dealing. In 1978, Anthony Joseph Celebrezze defeated incumbent Republican Ted W. Brown in the election for Ohio Secretary of State. Tony served as Ohio secretary of state from 1979 to 1983.

===Attorney general===
In 1982, Anthony Joseph Celebrezze ran for Ohio Attorney General, facing off against by Republican Charles R. Saxbe, a member of the Ohio House of Representatives. Both were the sons of former Presidential Cabinet members with good name recognition. Tony would beat Saxbe by a margin of nearly two-to-one (2,036,243 to 1,203,797).

Anthony Joseph Celebrezze easily won re-election in 1986 by defeating Barry Levey, 1,821,587 to 1,222,102. 
While serving as attorney general, Anthony Joseph Celebrezze fought a legal battle against the United States Department of Energy over the nuclear and chemical pollution at the Fernald nuclear weapons plant, which for years had been kept secret under the disguise of the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center. The legal victory gave the Ohio state government the right to regulate the clean-up of the site.

===Run for governor===
In 1990, Celebrezze ran for governor to replace Richard F. Celeste, who was barred from running for a third consecutive term due to term limits. For lieutenant governor, Celebrezze chose Eugene Branstool, an Ohio state senator who was a mid-state farmer from Utica, Ohio. The pair easily won the Democratic primary over Michael Hugh Lord and Judy Wynn Parker (683,932 to 131,564).

For the general election, Celebrezze faced a formidable Republican foe, George Voinovich, the popular out-going Mayor of Cleveland. Voinovich&#x27;s running mate was Mike DeWine, a U.S. Congressman from Cedarville, Ohio. Celebrezze lost in a landslide (1,938,103 to 1,539,416). Some analysts attribute his loss, in part, to Celebrezze&#x27;s much-criticized switch from his long-held pro-life views to a pro-choice position. However, the combination of Voinovich and DeWine was balanced better geographically, whereby Voinovich took the northeast Ohio votes from Celebrezze&#x27;s natural base and DeWine adding the votes from down-state urban areas in the southeast such as Greater Dayton and Greater Cincinnati.

==After politics==
Celebrezze was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame in 1998.
In April 2001, Celebrezze joined Kegler Brown Hill &amp; Ritter, a law firm based in Columbus, Ohio.

==Personal life==
Celebrezze and his wife, the former Louisa Godwin, had five children.

Celebrezze died on July 4, 2003, of a heart attack after finishing third in a Legend Car auto race at Shadybowl Speedway in De Graff, Ohio.

Celebrezze&#x27;s cousins were former Ohio Chief Justice Frank Celebrezze and former Ohio Supreme Court Judge James Celebrezze. Celebrezze was the father of Anthony J. Celebrezze III and the cousin of Ohio appeals court judge Frank D. Celebrezze III. His uncle was Frank D. Celebrezze Sr.

<text>Science as a Vocation (German: &quot;Wissenschaft als Beruf&quot;) is the text of a lecture given in 1917 at Munich University by German sociologist and political economist Max Weber. Weber reportedly delivered the lecture &quot;without notes and without pause.&quot; The original version of the text was published in German, and at least two translations in English exist.

&quot;Science as a Vocation&quot; is the first of the two &quot;Vocation&quot; lectures. The second lecture, &quot;Politics as a Vocation,&quot; was also delivered in Munich, in January 1919.

==Summary==
In &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot;, Weber weighed the benefits and detriments of choosing a career as an academic at a university who studies science or humanities. Weber probes the question &quot;what is the value of science?&quot; and focuses on the nature of ethics underpinning the scientific career. Science, to Weber, gives methods of explanation and means of justifying a position, but it cannot explain why that position is worth holding in the first place; this is the task of philosophy. No science is free from suppositions, and the value of a science is lost when its suppositions are rejected.

At one point in the lecture, Weber compares the nature of an artist&#x27;s work to that of a scientist. He argues that the artist&#x27;s work can reach fulfillment; the scientist&#x27;s work, on the other hand, by its very nature, is designed to be surpassed.

Weber reasons that science can never answer the fundamental questions of life, such as directing people on how to live their lives and what to value. Value, he contends, can only be derived from personal beliefs such as religion. He further argues for the separation of reason and faith, noting that each has its place in its respective field but, if crossed over, cannot work.

Weber also separates fact from value in politics. He argues that a teacher should impart knowledge to students and teach them how to clarify issues logically – even political issues – but teachers should never use the classroom to indoctrinate or preach their personal political views.

Weber also makes some practical comments about research and teaching. He notes that good scholars can be poor teachers, and that qualities that make one a good scholar, or a good thinker, are not necessarily the same qualities that make for good leaders or role models.

==Dating==
There has been some debate about when Weber delivered this lecture. Older sources often give the year as 1918. But based on a range of evidence scholars now think that Weber gave these lectures in 1917.

<text>&quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; () is an essay by German economist and sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920). It originated in the second lecture of a series (the first was &quot;Science as a Vocation&quot;) he gave in Munich to the &quot;Free (i.e. Non-incorporated) Students Union&quot; of Bavaria on 28 January 1919. This happened during the German Revolution when Munich itself was briefly the capital of the Bavarian Socialist Republic. Weber gave the speech based on handwritten notes which were transcribed by a stenographer. The essay was published in an extended version in July 1919, and translated into English only after World War II. The essay is today regarded as a classic work of political science and sociology.

==Summary==

Weber defines the following: &quot;The state is seen as the sole grantor of the &#x27;right&#x27; to physical force. Therefore, &#x27;politics&#x27; in our case would mean the pursuit for a portion of power or for influencing the division of power whether it is between states, or between groups of people which the state encompasses.&quot; Following this definition, Weber notes that there are three principles justifying the legitimacy of political domination of the state: traditional authority, charismatic authority, and legal authority.

Much of the middle part of &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; consists of Weber&#x27;s definitions of charisma and leaders, and of the type of people who are called to the profession of politics. This is developed by lengthy historical descriptions of how modern politics emerged. Emphasis is placed on the historical examples of Great Britain, the United States, and Germany, though examples from France, China, Rome, Ancient Greece, and elsewhere are mentioned. In developing these examples, Weber demonstrates the extent of his grasp of comparative historical research. To do this, Weber describes the relationship between politicians, political parties, and the bureaucracies they create. In this section, Weber&#x27;s writing in &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; is similar to his writing in another of his well-known essays, &quot;Bureaucracy.&quot;

In the final section of &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot;, Weber returns to the description of the politician. His main point is that the politician needs to balance an &quot;Ethic of Moral Conviction&quot; with an &quot;Ethic of Responsibility.&quot; The Ethic of Moral Conviction refers to the core unshakeable beliefs that a politician must hold. The Ethic of Responsibility refers to the day-to-day need to use the means of the state&#x27;s violence in a fashion which preserves the peace for the greater good. A politician, Weber writes, must make compromises between these two ethics.

To do this, Weber writes, &quot;Politics is made with the head, not with the other parts of body, nor the soul&quot;. The most effective politician is one who can excite the emotions of the people who follow, while governing strictly with a cold hard reasonthe head. But, he believes, this is a task normal humans cannot do, because they are vain.

Weber writes that vanity creates unique problems for politicians because they do indeed control the tools of legitimate violence. Common vanity, Weber writes, means that politicians are tempted to make decisions based on emotional attachments to followers and sycophants, and not on the rational reasoning needed to govern justly and effectively. Weber finds this to be a common characteristic among politicians. As a result, Weber claims, the danger of politics is rooted in the relationship of the politician to the means of violence which are intrinsic to the state, and which will be misused by any vain politician. This is why Weber emphasizes that the practice of politics is so difficult, and not a task for someone who seeks salvation for their eternal soul through the practice of peace and brotherhood. In developing these points, he makes reference to the two kingdoms doctrine of Martin Luther, and the holy Hindu Upanishads.

In the concluding sentences of the essay, Weber comments on the German Revolution of 1919 which was underway when he wrote the essay. He gloomily predicts that the emotional excitement of the moment in 1919 will bring only &quot;polar nights with an icy darkness and harshness, no matter what group will successfully seize power at present.&quot; After saying this, Weber ends on a mildly optimistic note: &quot;Only someone who is certain that it will not break him when, from where he stands, the world looks too stupid or mean for what he wants to offer itthat in spite of everything he will be able to say ‘but, &quot;still&quot;!&#x27;only he has the &#x27;call&#x27; [&quot;den &quot;Beruf&quot;&quot;] for politics!&quot;

== Three grounds for legitimate rule ==
Weber defines politics as a form of &quot;independent leadership activity&quot;. In this essay, the &quot;state&quot; serves as the placeholder for the analysis of political organizations. The grounds for the legitimate rule of these political organizations, according to Weber, fall into three major categories, or types:
;Traditional Authority: The authority of &quot;eternal past,&quot; based on habit. Weber defines custom as largely patriarchal, patrimonial, and traditional in scope.
;Charisma Authority (Gift of Grace): The authority of the &quot;revelations, heroism, or other leadership qualities of an individual&quot;. Associated with &quot;charisma&quot; of prophets, demagogues, and popular vote.
;Legal Authority: Legal rational authority, legality based on valid statutes which are enforced by technically trained civil servants. Legal authority assumes a rational competence and conditioned obedience of both the civil servants and the people to the legal apparatus.

== The two forms of the state ==
Weber focuses his analysis on &quot;political organizations&quot;, i.e. &quot;states&quot;, and identifies two general forms of the state, supposedly encompassing all state forms at the most general level:
# The administrative staff beneath the ruler in status and power has its own means of administration separate from those of the ruler. This can include various forms of wealth and possessions, as well as means of production and control over labor. This administrative staff is essentially aristocratic, subdivided into distinct estates;
# The administrative staff is completely or partially separated from the actual tools of administration, similar to Marx&#x27;s conception of how the proletariat is separated from the means of production. This staff become confidants without means in a patriarchal organization of deference and delegation.

Weber delineates two different ideas of the &quot;state&quot; based on the relationship between the administrators and their access to the actual means of administration. The first form is &quot;patrimonialism&quot; and dependent on the personality of the ruler, and the loyalty of his followers. There is no emphasis on technical capacity as there is in the second form of the state, which is considered to be modern. In the modern form, the administrators do not personally own the money, buildings, and organizations they direct. Executive decisions often remain with political figures, even though they do not have the technical ability that the modern professional administrators do.

<text>The Alsea River flows from Alsea, an unincorporated community in the coastal mountains of the U.S. state of Oregon, to the Pacific Ocean near the city of Waldport. It begins at the confluence of the North Fork Alsea River and the South Fork Alsea River and ends in Alsea Bay, a wide estuary at Waldport. The river flows generally west-northwest in a winding course through the mountains of southern Benton and Lincoln counties, passing near the unincorporated community of Tidewater and through the Siuslaw National Forest. Its drainage basin extends into Lane County, along the headwaters of the South Fork Alsea River.

The Alsea River supports runs of chinook and coho salmon, as well as steelhead and coastal cutthroat trout. The Alsea River Fish Hatchery is along one of its tributaries, the North Fork Alsea River.

==Course==
The Alsea River begins in the Central Oregon Coast Range near the unincorporated community of Alsea, and flows generally west about to the Pacific Ocean at Waldport, on the west coast of the United States. Formed by the confluence of the South Fork Alsea River and the North Fork Alsea River, the stream meanders through the Siuslaw National Forest for all but the last of its course. Oregon Route 34 follows the river closely, crossing it once about from the mouth.

During its first or so, the river receives Cathcart Creek, Roberts Creek, and Mill Creek, all from the , and passes Mill Creek Boat Landing on the right. Oregon Route 34 parallels the river on the north; that is, on the right facing downstream. Here the river begins a long, roughly U-shaped loop around the south end of Digger Mountain, which rises to above sea level at coordinates . Along this stretch, which is about long, the river passes under Hayden Covered Bridge; receives Schoolhouse Creek from the right, Birch Creek from the , and Narrows Creek and Maltby Creek from the right, passes Campbell Boat Landing on the right and Salmonberry Boat Landing on the left, goes under Salmonberry Road, receives Salmonberry Creek from the left, passes Missouri Bend Recreation Site and Boat Ramp on the left, and receives Benner Creek from the left and Digger Creek from the right. Slightly west of the mountain, about from the mouth, the river leaves Benton County, and enters Lincoln County.

Passing Little Digger Mountain on the right, the river receives Fall Creek from the right, Cow Creek and Minotti Creek from the left, and Wolf Creek, Phillips Creek, Cedar Creek, and Butter Creek from the right as it passes Trenholm Saddle, a mountain gap at coordinates on the right about from the mouth. About later, the river begins another U-shaped loop of about around the south end of Stoney Mountain, which rises to above sea level.

Flowing around Stoney Mountain, the Alsea River receives Five Rivers and Lake Creek from the left, passes Blackberry Campground on the left, receives Grass Creek and Brush Creek from the left and Schoolhouse Creek from the right, passes Mike Bauer Picnic Grounds on the right and, shortly thereafter, a USGS gauging station on the right from the mouth. About further downstream, the river passes Slide Campground on the right before entering Hellion Rapids at coordinates . Downstream of the rapids, the river receives Scott Creek, Slide Creek, and Hatchery Creek, all from the right, and Line Creek from the left before reaching the unincorporated community of Tidewater, about from the mouth.

Between Tidewater and Alsea Bay, the river receives Mill Creek and Squaw Creek from the right, Canal Creek from the left, Risley Creek from the right, passes under Oregon Route 34, which then parallels the river on the south or left, and receives Arnold Creek from the left at about from the mouth. About later, it leaves the Siuslaw National Forest. Shortly thereafter, it receives Southworth Creek and Constantine Creek from the left and Drift Creek from the right. It receives Eckman Creek from the left, passes W. B. Nelson State Recreation Site on the left about from the mouth and enters Alsea Bay. As part of the bay, it receives Lint Creek from the left, passes Waldport on the left, flows under U.S. Route 101, and enters the Pacific Ocean at the mouth of the bay.

<text>It&#x27;s Hard is the tenth studio album by English rock band the Who. Released in September 1982, it was the final Who album to feature bassist John Entwistle, who died in 2002. It was also the second and final Who studio album with drummer Kenney Jones, as well as the last to be released on Warner Bros. Records in the US. It was released on Polydor Records in the UK, peaking at No. 11, and on Warner Bros. in the US where it peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. The US rights to both this album and &quot;Face Dances&quot; subsequently reverted to the band, who then licensed them to MCA Records (later Geffen Records, itself once distributed by WB) for reissue. The album achieved gold status by the RIAA in the US in November 1982. It was their last album for over two decades until &quot;Endless Wire&quot; in 2006.

== Artwork ==
The album cover, designed and photographed by Graham Hughes, depicts a young boy playing an Atari &quot;Space Duel&quot; arcade game. This is intended as a contemporary update to the song &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, from the album &quot;Tommy&quot;.

== Background ==
The first track on the album, &quot;Athena&quot;, peaked at No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Singles chart. &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Turn&quot; and &quot;One at a Time&quot; were written by Entwistle, but he only sang lead vocals on &quot;One at a Time&quot; with Daltrey singing lead on the two others.

In 1997, MCA Records re-released the album with new mixes for several songs, correcting problems evident in the original mixes for &quot;Athena&quot; and &quot;Eminence Front&quot;.

In 1994, Daltrey said &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; should never have been released&quot; and that he also had arguments with Townshend over the release of the album. He stated the record company wanted them to make a new record, then do a tour for the album, so in many ways they were forced to release it. In a 1985 interview, Townshend said, &quot;&quot;Face Dances&quot; and &quot;It’s Hard&quot; were made by a band who were very unsure about whether or not they wanted to be making a record, and I think that’s a terrible doubt.&quot;

Alternate takes exist of &quot;Eminence Front&quot; featuring Roger Daltrey on lead vocals and &quot;One Life&#x27;s Enough&quot; featuring Pete Townshend on lead vocals.

&quot;I&#x27;ve Known No War&quot; features the orchestra arrangement from the 1979 Quadrophenia film version of &quot;I&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

Critical reviews on its release in 1982 were polarized. Parke Puterbaugh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it the magazine&#x27;s highest rating (5 stars) and commented that it was &quot;their most vital and coherent album since [the 1971 album] &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;&quot;. Puterbaugh also proclaimed that the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Known No War&quot; was &quot;a song that could become an anthem to our generation much the way &#x27;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&#x27; did a decade ago.&quot; Robert Christgau, on the other hand, icily disparaged the &quot;prolix&quot; nature and &quot;operatic pretensions&quot; of Townshend&#x27;s musical ideas, as well as his &quot;book-club poetry&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considered the album to be an &quot;undistinguished final effort&quot; with &quot;few memorable melodies and little energy&quot;.

== Live performances ==
Just over half of this album has been played live over the course of the band&#x27;s career, most of the performances coming from the then farewell tour in 1982 supporting the album.

&quot;Dangerous&quot; was the first song from this album to be played live, as the third song on the band&#x27;s first 1982 concert. Its live performances did not deviate too far from the studio cut.

&quot;Athena&quot; was played sporadically on the 1982 tour, sometimes as an encore and at other times in the regular set. The band hated playing the song and thought that their performance on it was not up to their standards, so they dropped it mid-tour.

&quot;A Man Is a Man&quot; was also played sporadically on the same tour, and its last performance also came during the same concert with the last performance of &quot;Athena&quot;.

&quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; was played throughout the entire 1982 tour and regularly featured a short full-band jam at its conclusion.

&quot;Cooks County&quot; was only played once, on 6 October 1982 at the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago, in place of &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot;. This was because the song was written by Townshend after seeing a television documentary on Chicago&#x27;s Cook County Hospital.

&quot;Eminence Front&quot; was one of two songs (the other being &quot;Cry If You Want&quot;) from this album to last until after the 1982 tour, and the only one to become a staple of the band&#x27;s concerts. It was played in the tours of 1982, 1989, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006–2007, 2008, 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2022.

&quot;Cry If You Want&quot; was played in every 1982 concert except one. These performances featured Townshend playing an extended guitar solo as an outro. In 2006, Daltrey requested that it be brought back, and it was for the first leg of the tour. However, it did not stay in the set list for long, only lasting three concerts. Later, the band would start incorporating it into their jams of &quot;My Generation&quot;, albeit in a shorter and jazzier form, where it lasted until 2009. The song was briefly revived for The Who Hits 50! tour in late 2014.

== 2011 reissue ==

On 24 December 2011 the original mix of the album was reissued in Japan in a miniature replica of the original album art work. The album was remastered by Jon Astley for this reissue using Direct Stream Digital (DSD) to transfer the analog master tape to digital and included the bonus tracks added to the CD release of the album. The release was a limited edition in the SHM-CD format. The reissue included a picture of the original vinyl label.

== Track listing ==
All songs written by Pete Townshend except where noted. The 1997 digitally remastered reissue of &quot;It&#x27;s Hard&quot; added four live tracks recorded on the last show of the Who&#x27;s 1982 tour, on 17 December in Toronto.

<doc id="709506" wikidata="Q359333" url="?curid=709506" title="Anthony J. Celebrezze">
<text>Anthony Joseph Celebrezze Sr. (born Antonio Giuseppe Cilibrizzi, ; September 4, 1910 – October 29, 1998) was an American politician of the Democratic Party, who served as the 49th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, as a cabinet member in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

==Early life and education==

Celebrezze was born in 1910 as one of thirteen children to Dorothy (née Marcogiuseppe) and Rocco Cilibrizzi in Anzi, a town in the administrative region of Basilicata, southern Italy. The family moved to the United States when he was two years old, and the surname was Americanized in spelling to &quot;Celebrezze.&quot; . After having been a shepherd in Anzi, the father Rocco took an industrial job, becoming a track laborer for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad in Cleveland.

Like many of his immigrant generation, Anthony Celebrezze took odd jobs as a youngster, shining shoes and selling newspapers. He attended Cleveland Public Schools, graduating from Central High School and Fenn College (later developed as Cleveland State University).

He graduated from John Carroll University in 1934. During his college years, he earned his way by working as a railroad laborer and freight truck driver, as well as boxer. He later attended Ohio Northern University in Ada, Ohio, where he received a Bachelor of Laws in 1936 from the Claude W. Pettit College of Law (then known as the Warren G. Harding College of Law).

==Marriage, World War II, and career==
Celebrezze began working for the Ohio Unemployment Commission in Columbus, Ohio. In 1938, he passed the bar and returned to Cleveland, where he entered the general practice of law. That same year, he married Anne M. Marco, a graduate of Western Reserve University and a teacher in the Cleveland Public School system, on May 7, 1938. With the onset of World War II, Celebrezze enlisted in the United States Navy. Upon his discharge at the end of the war, he returned to private practice.

==Political career==

In 1950, Celebrezze ran for a seat in the Ohio State Senate, vacated by Howard Metzenbaum, and won. He served as an Ohio state senator from 1951 to 1953. One of the few Democrats to serve in the Senate at the time, Celebrezze cultivated a friendly relationship with the Republican majority. Governor Frank J. Lausche, a Democrat and former mayor of Cleveland, did not have a good relationship with the Democratic leadership in the Senate. Lausche thus relied heavily on Celebrezze to represent his interests in the Senate.

In 1952, when Celebrezze sought re-election to the state senate, he ran into trouble when he crossed the Democratic party chairman, Ray T. Miller, by supporting fellow Italian American Michael DiSalle for the United States Senate instead of James M. Carney. Celebrezze was renominated by his party and won the general election. Six years later in his gubernatorial campaign, he ran against DiSalle.

===Mayor of Cleveland===

In 1952, after continuing battles with the Democratic leadership in the Senate, Celebrezze resigned to run for Mayor of Cleveland. The office was open because sitting mayor Thomas A. Burke had decided not to seek another term. The Democratic party organization chose Albert S. Porter, Engineer of Cuyahoga County, to succeed Burke. Although lacking support from Party Chairman Miller, Celebrezze had the backing of Governor Lausche. Mayor Burke did not favor either candidate.

In the open primary among Porter, Celebrezze, and Republican juvenile court Judge William J. McDermott, Celebrezze won a decisive victory, having a substantial lead over McDermott. Porter came in third. In the general election, Celebrezze again defeated Republican McDermott. He was endorsed by the &quot;Cleveland Press&quot; editor Louis B. Seltzer.

After that, Celebrezze was elected for an unprecedented five two-year terms as mayor, serving from 1953 to 1962. At the time, Cleveland was the fifth-largest city in the nation. Celebrezze drove efforts to build or upgrade the city&#x27;s infrastructure, and conducted a massive $140 million urban-renewal program. Major portions of the rapid-transit system were constructed during this time, most notably the Red Line, which connected much of the city to the existing Blue and Green lines. There was also extensive work done on the city&#x27;s freeway system, the Port of Cleveland, and Burke Lakefront Airport.

In 1958 Celebrezze was elected president of the American Municipal Association (now the National League of Cities) in 1958. That same year, he sought the Democratic nomination for Governor of Ohio, but lost to Michael DiSalle. In 1960, he launched the Erieview urban renewal plan, designed by architect I. M. Pei. The most prominent result of the plan was the Erieview Tower. He also spurred several building projects, most notably a federal office building (which was later named after him after his death), and the Garden Valley housing project.

In 1962, Celebrezze served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

In 1961, after years of denying rumors that he sought a higher public office, Celebrezze was offered a federal judgeship by President John F. Kennedy, which was a lifetime appointment to a federal judgeship. Celebrezze turned it down to run for a record-breaking fifth consecutive term as mayor, which he won by an unprecedented 73.8 percent, sweeping every one of the city&#x27;s thirty-three wards. Kennedy appointed him also to serve on the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and the Commission on the Status of Women. In 1962, Celebrezze was selected as the president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

===Cabinet Secretary===

In 1962, President Kennedy returned to Celebrezze with an offer of a cabinet appointment as United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Celebrezze resigned as mayor in 1962 before his appointment on July 31, 1962. He continued his service under President Lyndon Johnson following Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in November 1963.

During this time, Celebrezze contributed to the enactment of landmark social legislation, most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Social Security Act of 1965. One of Celebrezze&#x27;s most important achievements as secretary of HEW was separating the public assistance and child health and welfare functions from the Social Security Administration, and transferring these programs to a new Welfare Administration. Celebrezze shaped HEW to fit Johnson&#x27;s initiatives, including getting power from Congress to deny funds for any federal HEW program to any state or institution that practiced racial segregation.

Celebrezze found it difficult to maintain two households on his $25,000 salary and apart from his family, and asked Johnson to return to Cleveland. &quot;We are going to lose the house in Cleveland if I continue to live here, Mr. President,&quot; Celebrezze told Johnson. The President replied that Celebrezze was too honest for Washington because he was the first cabinet secretary &quot;to go broke while working for the White House.&quot; Celebrezze resigned as HEW Secretary on August 17, 1965.

==Federal judicial service==

Celebrezze was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 27, 1965, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which had been vacated by Judge Lester Lefevre Cecil. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 19, 1965, and received his commission on August 19, 1965. After more than fifteen years of service, Celebrezze assumed senior status on October 1, 1980. His service terminated on October 29, 1998, due to his death.

===Notable cases===

Celebrezze authored numerous opinions, including &quot;Beasley v. United States&quot;, which established a fair and progressive standard of &quot;effective assistance of counsel&quot; under the sixth amendment, &quot;Hill v. Tennessee Valley Authority&quot;, &quot;Gabriele v. Chrysler Corp.&quot;, and &quot;Krause v. Rhodes&quot;.

==Death==

In the last three years of his life, Celebrezze was mostly inactive on the court, and spent most of his time organizing his personal papers. In the summer of 1998, he became easily fatigued, and advanced throat cancer was diagnosed about September. He was hospitalized briefly at Lakewood Hospital and at the Cleveland Clinic before transferring to the Corinthian Skilled Nursing Center in Cleveland about October 22, 1998. He died there on October 29, 1998. His funeral was held at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland, and he was buried at in Brook Park, Ohio.

==Celebrezze political family==

Celebrezze and his wife Anne had three children: Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., Jean Ann (Celebrezze) Porto, and Susan Marie (Celebrezze) Sullivan. Anthony Jr. became an attorney and served as Ohio Attorney General; he also ran for governor. The pair are the only father and son to both run as candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Ohio. His grandson Anthony J. Celebrezze III (son of Anthony Jr.), also ran for public office.

Celebrezze&#x27;s older brother Frank D. Celebrezze I (b. 1899) also became an attorney and was active in civic service. He served as Cleveland Safety Director and later was appointed as a Cleveland Municipal Court judge. His descendants also became attorneys and active politically. Frank Celebrezze became Ohio Chief Justice, and James Celebrezze became an Ohio Supreme Court Judge. Frank D. Celebrezze Jr. (grandson to the first Frank) became an Ohio Appeals Court Judge, and Leslie Ann Celebrezze became Domestic Relations Judge of Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.

==Legacy==

*In 1964, Celebrezze received the Alumni Medal from his alma mater, John Carroll University. In 1978, JCU conferred him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. He also had honorary degrees from Fenn College, Boston College, LaSalle College, Ohio Northern University, Rhode Island College, Bowling Green State University, Wilberforce University, Miami University (Ohio) and Cleveland State University.
*The federal building in Cleveland is named after Celebrezze, as well as an archives room at Ohio Northern University law school (Ada, Ohio). Additionally, a Cleveland Fire Department fireboat was named after Celebrezze.

<text>The Law of the Soviet Union was the law as it developed in the Soviet Union (USSR) following the October Revolution of 1917. Modified versions of the Soviet legal system operated in many Communist states following the Second World War—including Mongolia, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Warsaw Pact countries of eastern Europe, Cuba and Vietnam.

==Soviet concept of law==
Soviet law was rooted in pre-revolutionary Russian law and Marxism-Leninism. Pre-revolutionary influences included Byzantine law, Mongol law, Russian Orthodox Canon law, and Western law. Western law was mostly absent until the judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864, five decades before the revolution. Despite this, the supremacy of law and equality before the law were not well-known concepts, the tsar was still not bound by the law, and the &quot;police had unlimited authority.&quot;

Marxism-Leninism views law as a superstructure in the base and superstructure model of society. &quot;Capitalist&quot; law was a tool of &quot;bourgeois domination and a reflection of bourgeois values.&quot; Since law was a tool &quot;to maintain class domination&quot;, in a classless society, law would inevitably disappear.

Like all other government institutions, the judiciary was officially subordinated to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

In 1917, the Soviet authorities formally repealed all Tsarist legislation and established a socialist legal system. According to a critic, Richard Pipes, this system abolished Western legal concepts including the rule of law, civil liberties, the protection of law and guarantees of property. For example, profiteering could be interpreted as a counter-revolutionary activity punishable by death. Soviet authors claimed that a new socialist rule of law was created, protecting personal properties and civil liberties, and developing the basis of an international rule of law.

The deportation of the &#x27;Kulaks&#x27; in 1928–31 was carried out within the terms of Soviet Civil Code. Some Soviet legal scholars even asserted that &quot;criminal repression&quot; may be applied in the absence of guilt.&quot;.

The year 1960 saw a new edition the Soviet criminal code. The new Criminal Code replaced the Soviet analogue of 1960.

The 1960s reforms tried to improve the judicial system and the activities of the courts, the restoration and development of several democratic principles dismantling special conferences attached to the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs and certain categories of state crimes.

* 1924 Soviet Constitution
* 1936 Soviet Constitution
* 1977 Soviet Constitution

==Court structure==
Soviet criminal and civil cases involve trials that were &quot;primarily[...]official investigation[s] of the truth of the claims and defenses presented&quot;. Soviet law was very similar in this respect to civil law of European countries like France and Germany.

===Criminal cases===
Criminal cases consisted of a preliminary examination before the indictment and the actual trial. In the preliminary examination, the &quot;sledovatel&quot; (or &quot;investigator&quot;) &quot;interrogate[d] the accused and the witnesses and examine[d] evidence&quot;. The accused was informed of his/her rights before the examination. Before 1958, counsel was only available during the trial. After 1958, counsel was available at the last stage of the preliminary examination after the accused was indicted. The examiner was prohibited from using force though the accused could be confined for long durations: up to 10 days before being charged, up to 9 months during the preliminary investigation (with the approval of the Procurator General). The testimony to be used in the trial was presented to the accused. The sledovatel was subordinate to the procurator (prokuratura) that was tasked with the prosecution, &quot;&#x27;general supervision&#x27; of legality&quot;, and reporting illegal administrative actions. The indictment that included the preliminary examination was considered the &quot;official record&quot; at trial.

The trial court consisted of a professional judge with a 5-year term and two assessors (lay judges) from the population with a 2.5-year term. The proceedings were informal compared to criminal procedure in democratic countries based on the rule of law. The judges first questioned accused and witnesses, then the procurator and defense counsel to corroborate the evidence in the indictment. The accused and the victim could question each other or the witnesses. The accused was presumed innocent, though not in the common law sense. The court decided by majority vote. The accused or the procurator could appeal decisions to a higher court consisting of three professional judges that reviewed the facts and the law. If the procurator appealed, the higher court could set aside the judgment and remand the case. Although the decision of the appeals court was &quot;final&quot;, higher courts could review them as &quot;supervision&quot;. Here, the accused or his/her counsel could submit briefs, but they could not appear in person.

During the trial, the judges had the additional responsibility of educating the people, for example revealing and removing the causes and conditions that led to the crime. Judges kept legal technicalities to a minimum; the court&#x27;s stated purpose was to find the truth, rather than to protect legal rights. Although most hearings were open to the public, hearings could also be held privately, if the Soviet Government deemed it necessary.

===Civil court===
Soviet civil court process did not entail a high degree of physical interference. There was no sudden arrest or detention during a preliminary investigation phase. The trial was conducted entirely by a counsel and, if need be, a stay was obtained.

==Human rights==

According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights are the &quot;basic [rights] and freedoms to which all humans are entitled&quot;, including the right to [life] and [liberty], freedom of expression, and equality before the law; and social, cultural and economic rights, including the right to participate in culture, the right to food, the right to work, and the right to education.

The Soviet conception of human rights was very different from international law. According to Soviet legal theory, &quot;it is the government who is the beneficiary of human rights which are to be asserted &quot;against&quot; the individual&quot;. The Soviet state was considered as the source of human rights. Therefore, the Soviet legal system regarded law as an arm of politics and courts as agencies of the government. Extensive extrajudicial powers were given to the Soviet secret police agencies. The Soviet government in practice significantly curbed the rule of law, civil liberties, protection of law and guarantees of property, which were considered as examples of &quot;bourgeois morality&quot; by Soviet law theorists such as Andrey Vyshinsky. According to Vladimir Lenin, the purpose of socialist courts was &quot;not to eliminate terror ... but to substantiate it and legitimize it in principle&quot;.

The USSR and other countries of the Soviet bloc had abstained from affirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), saying it was &quot;overly juridical&quot; and potentially infringed on national sovereignty. The Soviet Union later signed legally-binding human rights documents, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973 (and the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), but they were neither widely known or accessible to people living under Communist rule, nor were they taken seriously by the Communist authorities. Sergei Kovalev recalled &quot;the famous article 125 of the Constitution which enumerated all basic civil and political rights&quot; in the Soviet Union. But when he and other prisoners attempted to use this as a legal basis for their abuse complaints, their prosecutor&#x27;s argument was that &quot;the Constitution was written not for you, but for American Negroes, so that they know how happy the lives of Soviet citizens are&quot;.

Crime was determined not as the infraction of law, but as any action which could threaten the Soviet state and society. For example, a desire to make a profit could be interpreted as a counter-revolutionary activity punishable by death. The liquidation and deportation of millions of peasants in 1928–31 was carried out within the terms of the Soviet Civil Code. Some Soviet legal scholars even said that &quot;criminal repression&quot; may be applied in the absence of guilt. Martin Latsis, chief of Soviet Ukraine&#x27;s secret police explained: &quot;Do not look in the file of incriminating evidence to see whether or not the accused rose up against the Soviets with arms or words. Ask him instead to which class he belongs, what is his background, his education, his profession. These are the questions that will determine the fate of the accused. That is the meaning and essence of the Red Terror.&quot;

The purpose of public trials was &quot;not to demonstrate the existence or absence of a crime – that was predetermined by the appropriate party authorities – but to provide yet another forum for political agitation and propaganda for the instruction of the citizenry (see Moscow Trials for example). Defense lawyers, who had to be party members, were required to take their client&#x27;s guilt for granted...&quot;

<doc id="709510" wikidata="Q337090" url="?curid=709510" title="King Arthur (2004 film)">
<text>King Arthur is a 2004 epic historical adventure film directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by David Franzoni. It features an ensemble cast with Clive Owen as the title character, Ioan Gruffudd as Lancelot and Keira Knightley as Guinevere, along with Mads Mikkelsen, Joel Edgerton, Hugh Dancy, Ray Winstone, Ray Stevenson, Stephen Dillane, Stellan Skarsgård and Til Schweiger.

The film is unusual in reinterpreting Arthur as a Roman officer rather than the typical medieval knight. Several literary works have also done so, including David Gemmell&#x27;s &quot;Ghost King&quot;, Jack Whyte&#x27;s &quot;Camulod Chronicles&quot;, and perhaps the strongest influence on this film, Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Warlord&quot; series. The producers of the film attempted to market it as a more historically accurate version of the Arthurian legends, supposedly inspired by new archaeological findings. The film also replaces the sword in the stone story with a darker and more tragic backstory of how Arthur claimed his sword Excalibur. The film was shot in Ireland, England, and Wales.

&quot;King Arthur&quot; was released by Buena Vista Pictures through the Touchstone Pictures label on July 7, 2004. The film received mixed to negative reviews with critics criticizing the setting, violence and battle sequences while praising the musical score, directing, performances and cinematography and grossed $203.6 million against a production budget of $120 million. 

==Plot==
In the 5th century AD, the declining Roman Empire is withdrawing from Britannia, where the native Woads, led by Merlin, stage an insurgency. A group of Sarmatian knights and their half-British Roman commander Artorius Castus, known as &quot;Arthur&quot;, have served their obligatory 15-year term fighting for Rome and are preparing to return home. Arthur himself plans to continue his career in Rome until Bishop Germanus orders them to complete one final mission: evacuate an important Roman family from north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, saving them from an advancing army of invading Saxons led by the ruthless Cerdic and his son, Cynric. Alecto, the son of the family patriarch, is a viable candidate to be a future Pope. Arthur and his remaining men – Lancelot, Tristan, Galahad, Bors, Gawain, and Dagonet – reluctantly accept the mission.

Arriving at their destination, they find that the Roman patriarch Marius, who refuses to leave, has enslaved the local population, enraging Arthur. He discovers a cell complex containing several dead Woads and two tortured survivors — a young woman named Guinevere and her younger brother Lucan. Arthur frees them and gives Marius an ultimatum — leave with them willingly or otherwise be taken prisoner. He and his knights commandeer the homestead and liberate its exploited people. The convoy flees into the mountains with the Saxons in pursuit. Marius leads an attempted coup but is slain by Guinevere. Arthur learns from Alecto that Germanus and his fellow bishops had Arthur&#x27;s childhood mentor and father figure Pelagius executed for heresy. This further disillusions Arthur with the Roman way of life, a process that matures when Guinevere and Merlin remind Arthur of his connection to the island of Britain through his Celtic mother.

Arthur leads the pursuing Saxons, led by Cynric, through a pass crossing a frozen lake. As battle ensues, Dagonet sacrifices himself to crack the lake ice with his axe, disrupting the Saxon advance. The knights safely deliver Alecto and his mother to Hadrian&#x27;s wall and are officially discharged. Arthur, having concluded that his destiny lies with his mother&#x27;s people, decides to engage the Saxons despite Lancelot&#x27;s pleas to leave with them. The night before the battle, he and Guinevere make love, and on the following day, Arthur meets Cerdic under a white flag of parley, vowing to kill him. He is soon joined by Lancelot and his fellow knights, who decide to fight. In the climactic Battle of Badon Hill, the Woads and knights whittle the Saxon army. Guinevere engages Cynric, who overwhelms her. Lancelot aids her and kills Cynric but is fatally wounded. Cerdic kills Tristan before facing off against Arthur, who kills the Saxon leader, condemning the invaders to defeat.

Arthur and Guinevere marry and Merlin proclaims Arthur as King of the Britons. United by their defeat of the Saxons and the retreat of the Romans, Arthur promises to lead the Britons against any future invaders. Three horses that had belonged to Tristan, Dagonet, and Lancelot run free across the landscape, as the closing narrative from Lancelot describes how fallen knights live on in tales passed from generation to generation.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Antoine Fuqua; David Franzoni, the writer of the original draft script for &quot;Gladiator&quot;, wrote the screenplay. The historical consultant for the film was John Matthews, an author known for his books on esoteric Celtic spirituality, some of which he co-wrote with his wife Caitlin Matthews. The research consultant was Linda A. Malcor, co-author of &quot;From Scythia to Camelot: A Radical Reinterpretation of the Legends of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the Holy Grail&quot;, in which possible non-Celtic sources for the Arthurian legends are explored.

The film&#x27;s main set, a replica of a section of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, was the largest film set ever built in Ireland, and was located in a field in County Kildare. The replica was one kilometre long, which took a crew of 300 building workers four and a half months to build. The fort in the film was based on the Roman fort named Vindolanda, which was built around 80 AD just south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in what is now called Chesterholm in Northern England.

Fuqua was reportedly dissatisfied with the film which he attributed to interference by Disney. Fuqua said of the experience: “Did I get to make the movie I wanted? No and no,” he says of both versions. “I started out making the movie I wanted, but that was before they (Disney) started to police me. They said, ‘Try not to show so much blood.’ If you agree to make a gritty, dark, realistic film, then everything should be like that. I mean, it&#x27;s set in the Dark Ages, when people were inconsiderate and decided to bleed everywhere.”

==Relationship with Arthurian legend==
===Cinematic versus traditional portrayal===

The film&#x27;s storyline is not taken from traditional sources but is a work of creative fiction. The only notable exception to this is the inclusion of the Saxons as Arthur&#x27;s adversaries and the Battle of Badon Hill. Most traditional elements of Arthurian legend are dropped, such as the Holy Grail and Tristan&#x27;s lover Iseult. The film barely includes the love triangle between Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere; while Guinevere and Arthur are romantically involved, only a few sequences depict a possible relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere. Sir Lucan is generally described as Bedivere’s younger brother, rather than being Guinevere’s brother, as in the film.

The knights&#x27; characterizations in Arthurian legend are also dropped or altered. For example, the film&#x27;s portrayal of a boorish and lusty Bors, the father of many children, differs greatly from his namesake, whose purity and celibacy allowed him to witness the Holy Grail. The cinematic portrayal of Bors is closer to the traditional depictions of Sir Kay and Sir Pellinore than to those of his legendary namesake. Lancelot and Galahad are portrayed as having similar ages in the film, though in texts like the Vulgate cycle they are father and son, respectively (the film&#x27;s approach is also found in modern Arthurian fiction — such as Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;, in which they are brothers).

The cinematic portrayal of Guinevere as a Celtic warrior who joins Arthur&#x27;s knights in battle is a drastic contrast to the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; found in many courtly romances. Although there is historical and mythological precedent for &quot;sword-swinging warrior queens&quot;, such as the British Boudica of the Iceni, Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd of Wales, or the various Celtic war goddesses, the film&#x27;s portrayal of Guinevere is actually closer to the Queen Medb of the Irish &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;. No source describes Guinevere as either a warrior or a rustic Celt; in fact, in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, which contains one of the oldest accounts of the character, Guinevere has Roman blood while Arthur is an Indigenous Celt. However, in some Welsh sources, Gwenhwyfar is attributed supernatural strength; and in one later Irish text, her daughter Melora is a trained warrior; so this portrayal is not entirely without textual precedent.

Though Merlin and Tristan are thought to have originated outside of the Arthurian legends (as did Lancelot, a French interpolation added by Chrétien de Troyes in the 12th century), they are frequently included in Arthurian texts and their presence is reflective of the broader Arthurian tradition. Some other traditional characters who are featured in the film, such as Galahad, were invented later. On the other hand, some of the most prominent Arthurian characters are not featured, such as Kay and Bedivere, both of whom are prevalent in early Arthuriana.

===Differences between the film and the Arthurian legend===
In the film, Arthur&#x27;s father is a Roman general from the Imperial Roman army and his mother is a Celtic woman. In the historical notes of the legend, Arthur&#x27;s father is Uther Pendragon, a famous Romano-British commander and one of Britain&#x27;s earlier kings, and his mother is Igraine, a beautiful young woman who was once the wife of Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall and one of Uther&#x27;s loyal subjects.

Arthur&#x27;s knights are described differently in the film and the legend. In the film, Lancelot, Tristan, Bors and the other Knights of the Round Table are Sarmatian knights fighting for the glory of the Roman Empire. In historical notes, the Knights of the Round Table are Britons, knights of Romano-Celtic Britain fighting for the freedom of Britain against the Saxons. A round table is briefly present in the movie, where Arthur&#x27;s knights regularly meet in equality, and which flummoxes bishop Germanus when he cannot find a place at the table to distinguish his stature.

===Other references to Arthurian legend===
Dagonet, a self-sacrificing warrior in the film, has Arthur&#x27;s court jester as his namesake. The character appears in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. Also in the film, Lancelot fights using two swords. This may be a reference to the ill-fated Sir Balin, the &quot;Knight with Two Swords&quot;, but this epithet refers to his cursed sword rather than his fighting style. Sir Palamedes is also sometimes noted for carrying two swords.

Tristan has a pet hawk, which may be a reference to &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, in which Tristan is noted as being skilled at falconry.

The role of the traitor, often ascribed to Mordred, is given a smaller part in the form of a young British scout, played by Alan Devine, who betrays his people to the Saxons. The character is unnamed but called &quot;British Scout&quot; in the credits. Tristan kills the traitor with an arrow from the other side of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall during the climactic battle.

===Relationship with other works===
Italian historian and novelist Valerio Massimo Manfredi claimed that the movie was almost a plagiarism of his 2002 novel &quot;The Last Legion&quot;, due to several similarities between the two works. These similarities include the reuse of some tropes and happenings present in the book and, especially, the attempt to give historical reliability to the main characters with the concept of King Arthur having Roman origins. Indeed, the events of the movie suggest a theory that is largely different from the one on which Manfredi&#x27;s novel is based, in which Artorius Castus isn&#x27;t even mentioned, and neither is the Sarmatian auxiliary army. According to Manfredi, &quot;King Arthur&quot;&#x27;s release and its commercial failure were among the main causes of the problems related to the movie adaptation of his novel, which was in development hell until its release in 2007.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;King Arthur&quot; grossed $15 million on its opening weekend in third place behind &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It eventually grossed $51.9 million in the United States and Canada and $151.7 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $203.6 million, against a production budget of $120 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;King Arthur&quot; has an approval rating of 31% based on 190 reviews being positive with the critics consensus being &quot;The magic is gone, leaving a dreary, generic action movie&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on reviews from 41 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; called the film &quot;profoundly stupid and inept&quot; and added, &quot;it&#x27;s an endless source of giggles once you realise that its historical revisionism has nothing to do with archeological discoveries and everything to do with the fact that no one at Disney would green-light an old-fashioned talky love triangle with a hero who dies and an adulterous heroine who ends up in a nunnery.&quot; A. O. Scott of the &quot;New York Times&quot; further remarked that the film was &quot;a blunt, glowering B picture, shot in murky fog and battlefield smoke, full of silly-sounding pomposity and swollen music (courtesy of the prolifically bombastic Hans Zimmer). The combat scenes, though boisterous and brutal, are no more coherent than the story, which requires almost as much exposition as the last &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. Luckily there is an element of broad, brawny camp that prevents &quot;King Arthur&quot; from being a complete drag.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; had a more positive response to the film and awarded it three out of four stars, writing, &quot;That the movie works is because of the considerable production qualities and the charisma of the actors, who bring more interest to the characters than they deserve. There is a kind of direct, unadorned conviction to the acting of Clive Owen and the others; raised on Shakespeare, trained for swordfights, with an idea of Arthurian legend in their heads since childhood, they don&#x27;t seem out of time and place like the cast of &quot;Troy&quot;. They get on with it.&quot;

Robin Rowland criticised critics who criticized the film for its Dark Age setting. Rowland pointed out that several Arthurian novels are set in the Dark Ages, like Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s &quot;Sword at Sunset&quot; and Mary Stewart&#x27;s Merlin trilogy (&quot;The Crystal Cave&quot;, &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; and &quot;The Last Enchantment&quot;). However, these works have little in common with the film&#x27;s story and Sarmatian angle. In response to criticism of the setting, a consultant on the film Linda A. Malcor said: &quot;I think these film-makers did a better job than most could have done when it comes to giving us something besides knights in tin foil and damsels in chiffon... [they] deserve a lot of praise for the effort that they made.&quot; Fellow Arthurian scholar Geoffrey Ashe&#x27;s opinion was unfavorable.

Later director Antoine Fuqua said:“When I first signed on to the movie it was to shoot an R movie, and then halfway through it - that changed, for all sorts of reasons. Obviously, it&#x27;s always money...That was very difficult for me and I had a tough time adjusting to that. I had to change a lot of my shooting style that I had set up because it just wouldn&#x27;t have been possible to do certain things and get a PG-13 rating, just because it would have been more graphic. Like I said, tonally, I had a whole different mindset. So once that happened, while I was filming, it made it difficult.“

==Director&#x27;s cut==
An unrated director&#x27;s cut of the film was released; it has extra footage of battle scenes as well as more scenes between Lancelot and Guinevere, whose traditional love triangle with Arthur is only hinted at in the theatrical version. The battle scenes are also bloodier and more graphic.

Several scenes are also omitted from the director&#x27;s cut, including one where the knights sit around a campfire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film, he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, and his hair is disheveled. In the Director&#x27;s Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur&#x27;s morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius&#x27;s image is removed.

==Marketing==
Despite these many drastic diversions from the source material (including the Welsh Mabinogion), the producers of the film attempted to market it as a more historically accurate version of the Arthurian legends. Other liberties were taken with the actors&#x27; appearances: Keira Knightley&#x27;s breasts were digitally enlarged for the US theatrical film poster.
