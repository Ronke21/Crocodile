<text>Gregory Paul Walden (born January 10, 1957) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1999 to 2021. He is a Republican. Walden is the son of three-term Oregon State Representative Paul E. Walden. In October 2019, Walden announced that he would not run for reelection in 2020.

==Early life, education, and career==
Walden was born in The Dalles, Oregon, the son of Elizabeth (née McEwen) and Paul Ernest Walden. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Oregon in 1981. Before being elected to Congress, Walden owned and ran radio stations.

== Political career ==
Walden served as press secretary and chief of staff to Congressman Denny Smith from 1981 to 1987. He was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was appointed to the Oregon State Senate to fill a vacancy that opened up when Wes Cooley was elected to the U. S. House. Walden rose to the position of assistant majority leader in the Senate and was considering a bid for Oregon Governor in 1994. But upon discovering that the son he and his wife were expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for governor or seek reelection to the state senate. Their son died soon after birth.

Walden was tapped as campaign manager for Cooley&#x27;s reelection bid, but after Cooley was caught in several lies about his military service, Walden was one of many Republicans who called on Cooley to drop out of the race. Walden went as far as to announce he was running for the 2nd District seat as an independent. But he served as the Oregon chairman of Bob Dole&#x27;s presidential campaign, and touted his &quot;strong Republican credentials&quot;, implying that he would serve as a Republican if elected. Walden&#x27;s candidacy led to fears that the Democrats could take advantage of a split in the Republican vote and take a seat they hadn&#x27;t held since 1981. This ended when Cooley&#x27;s predecessor, Bob Smith, was called out of retirement.

Smith did not run for reelection in 1998. Walden easily won the Republican primary and the November general election. His district contains some liberal-leaning communities such as Ashland and his hometown, Hood River, but most of it leans heavily Republican, and Walden has been reelected ten times without serious difficulty, never receiving less than 60% of the vote except in 2018, when he received 56%. In 2002, he defeated Democrat Peter Buckley, who later became a member of the Oregon House of Representatives. In 2006, Walden defeated Democratic nominee Carol Voisin, and in 2008 he won a sixth term with 70% of the vote over Democrat Noah Lemas and Pacific Green Tristin Mock. After Senator Gordon Smith&#x27;s defeat in the 2008 elections, Walden became the only Republican representing Oregon in Congress.

On October 28, 2019, Walden announced that he would not run for reelection. He disagreed with President Donald Trump over Trump&#x27;s attempts to finance his border wall project and backed sanctioning Russia despite Trump&#x27;s resistance. He voted to end the 35-day government shutdown and spoke up about the global warming crisis, but supported Trump in the Ukraine quid pro quo scandal.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Party leadership===
House Speaker John Boehner chose Walden to be chairman of the House Majority Transition Committee. He served as chairman of the House Republican leadership through most of 2010.

After the 2012 elections, Walden became chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. In July 2014, he announced he would seek a second term as chair, arguing he would help provide continuity in a changing leadership team after the defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. He served a second term, the traditional limit for holders of the office, ending in 2016.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Energy and Commerce
** Subcommittee on Communications and Technology (Chairman)
** Subcommittee on Energy and Power

From 2010 to 2011, Walden gave up his seat on the Committee on Energy and Commerce at Republican leadership&#x27;s request so that Parker Griffith, who had recently switched parties, could take his spot.

Walden founded the Small Brewers Caucus and the Digital Television Caucus; as of 2007, he was a member of 39 congressional caucuses.
Walden was also a member of the centrist Republican Main Street Partnership, the Congressional Cement Caucus and the Congressional Western Caucus.

===Sponsored legislation===
The following is an incomplete list of legislation Walden has introduced into the House of Representatives.
* Central Oregon Jobs and Water Security Act (H.R. 2640; 113th Congress), a land-use and water bill related to the Crooked River in Oregon and the Bowman Dam. H.R. 2640 would modify features of the Crooked River Project in central Oregon, near Prineville, and prioritize how water from the project is allocated. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law in December 2014.
* Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rule-making processes. The FCC would have to act in more transparently and accept public input on regulations. Walden said the bill was written in response, among other things, to a proposed FCC study on the newspaper editorial boards&#x27; decisions. Walden argued that &quot;Americans deserve greater... transparency and accountability from their government,&quot; particularly because &quot;an item as controversial as this study made it all the way through the FCC without so much as a commission vote.&quot; He called the study dangerous because it threatened the papers&#x27; free speech and freedom of the press rights.
* Hermiston Reversionary Interest Release Act (H.R. 3366; 113th Congress), a bill that would release the interest of the United States in some land being used for Oregon State University&#x27;s Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Hermiston, Oregon. This would enable the center to relocate without its land being returned to the federal government. The Bureau of Land Management opposed the bill and it died in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
* STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4572; 113th Congress), a bill related to the regulation of satellite broadcasting.

=== Malheur Wildlife Refuge ===
Walden, whose district office includes the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, said that although one militant was killed and another wounded in the armed occupation of the refuge, &quot;We can all be grateful that today has ended peacefully, and that this situation is finally over. Now, life in Harney County can begin to return to normal and the community can begin the long process of healing.&quot; He complained about allegedly poor federal forest and land management policies during the occupation, and said he would like to see changes to those policies: &quot;We need to foster a more cooperative spirit between the federal agencies and the people who call areas like Harney County home.&quot; On June 27, 2018, Walden pleaded for a pardon for Dwight and Steven Hammond, who repeatedly committed arson and threatened federal refuge workers over an 18-year period, saying that the original trial&#x27;s federal judge, Michael Robert Hogan, said that the mandatory sentence would &quot;shock the conscious [sic]&quot;. On July 10, Trump pardoned both men, commuting their sentences to time served. Steven had been scheduled to be released on June 29, 2019, and Dwight on February 13, 2020.

==Personal life==

Walden and his wife, Mylene, live in Hood River with their son Anthony. They participate in local civic groups such as the Rotary Club and the Chamber of Commerce.

Walden was a licensed amateur (ham) radio operator, W7EQI.

On January 31, 2007, Walden sold Columbia Gorge Broadcasting, which runs five stations in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, to Bicoastal Columbia River LLC in order to avoid any conflict of interest that might arise with his congressional duties.

Walden is an Episcopalian. He is a board member for American Edge, a lobbying organization for the technology industry. In 2022, it was reported in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that Walden was hired by Mindbloom, a telemedicine-based ketamine-assisted therapy company, for the purpose of lobbying on telehealth policies.

<text>Geneva Public Transport (, TPG) operates most of the public transportation system in canton of Geneva, Switzerland, including the city of Geneva. The agency&#x27;s head office is in Grand-Lancy, Lancy.

The TPG operates trams, trolleybuses and buses for the canton of Geneva and also serves some regions in neighbouring France. Local rail services are provided by the &quot;CFF&quot; (Swiss Federal Railways) and the SNCF, and passenger ferries across the lake by the &quot;Mouettes Genevoises Navigation&quot;. The TPG shares a common fare system (Unireso) with these services and some in neighbouring France so that a single ticket can be used for any public transport within its zones and times of validity.

==Timeline==
The TPG is the successor organization to the &quot;Compagnie Genevoise des Tramways Électriques&quot; (Geneva Electric Tramway Company), or CGTE, which operated trams throughout the canton and parts of neighbouring France from 1900 until 1 January 1977.

In December 2003, the TPG began road-testing a , double-articulated, mega-trolleybus manufactured by Hess and Vossloh Kiepe. The bus can carry 150 passengers. It entered passenger service in January 2004 on line 10 to the airport. This vehicle was created by adding a middle section to a trolleybus that was originally a single-articulated, vehicle. In 2005–06, TPG purchased ten all-new double-articulated trolleybuses from Hess, length , and they are numbered 781-790. As of late 2006, TPG&#x27;s fleet included 92 trolleybuses, all articulated (of which eleven were double-articulated).

As of 27 April 2008, the TPG network includes 6 tramway routes, 38 cantonal bus routes, 15 intercantonal (Canton of Vaud) and international (France) bus routes and 12 nighttime bus routes.

In December 2010, Line 18 opened, from Avanchet to Coutance; it was extended as far as CERN in May 2011, closed in December 2011 and replaced by Line 14. In December 2012, the tramway was again split into line 14 (Meyrin-Gravière – P+R Bernex) and line 18 (CERN – Carouge).

===Tramway Cornavin - Onex - Bernex (TCOB)===
Construction started in November 2008 and finished in December 2011. Line 14 originally ran from P+R Bernex to Meyrin-Gravière or CERN, but has since then been split into Line 14 (P+R Bernex – Meyrin-Gravière) and Line 18 (Carouge – CERN) in December 2012.

<text>Frank Bartlett Willis (December 28, 1871 – March 30, 1928) was an American politician and lawyer. He was a Republican from Ohio. He served as the 47th governor of Ohio from 1915 to 1917, then served as a U.S. Senator from Ohio from 1921 until his death in 1928.

==Biography==
Born on a farm near the hamlet of Lewis Center, Ohio, Willis was the son of a Civil War veteran, Vermont-born J.B. Willis and his wife Lavinia A. (Buell). Willis graduated from Ohio Northern University in 1894. After teaching at Ohio Northern for twelve years, Willis was admitted to the bar and began practicing law. He served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1900 to 1904 while teaching at Ohio Northern school of law, and was subsequently elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1910, serving from 1911 to 1915. Elected to the governorship in 1914, he served one two-year term from 1915 to 1917, but was not re-elected, being defeated by James M. Cox, whom he had defeated in 1914. Cox also defeated Willis in 1918.

After placing Warren Harding&#x27;s name in nomination at the 1920 Republican National Convention, Willis was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1920, replacing Harding, who then resigned his Senate seat to take the presidency, allowing Willis to take his seat early. During his Senate tenure, Willis served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions, which had jurisdiction over territories including Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, from 1923 to 1928.

Willis wanted to be Ohio&#x27;s favorite son candidate for the presidency in 1928. He died in office that year at Gray Chapel, Ohio Wesleyan University, in Delaware, Ohio, during a Republican Party event for his candidacy organized by the Delaware County Willis-for-President Club. He was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Willis&#x27;s official papers were donated to and are open for research at the Ohio History Center.

Frank B. Willis Education Center (formerly Intermediate School and High School) of Delaware City Schools is named in his honor.
Willis was married to Allie Dustin, and they had one daughter named Helen.

<text>Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe is a 1987 novel by American author Fannie Flagg. Set in Alabama, it weaves together the past and the present through the blossoming friendship between Evelyn Couch, a middle-aged housewife, and Ninny Threadgoode, an elderly woman who lives in a nursing home. Every week Evelyn visits Ninny, who recounts stories of her youth in Whistle Stop, Alabama, where her sister-in-law, Idgie, and her friend, Ruth, ran a café. These stories, along with Ninny&#x27;s friendship, enable Evelyn to begin a new, satisfying life while allowing the people and stories of Ninny&#x27;s youth to live on. The book explores themes of family, aging, lesbianism, and the dehumanizing effects of racism on both black and white people. 

It was adapted as a feature film, &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, which was released in 1991. A television series adaptation was reportedly in development as of 2020, with executive producers Norman Lear and Reba McEntire, who was also to star but the series was abandoned.

==Plot==
Throughout the novel the narrator and time period change, and chapter headings establish the date and source of the chapter. The narration alternates between the form of the fictional newsletter &quot;The Weems Weekly&quot;, the Threadgoodes&#x27; house in Birmingham, and an omniscient narration. The framing story, set in 1986, presents Evelyn Couch, who goes weekly with her husband to visit his mother in a nursing home. During one visit, Evelyn befriends Ninny Threadgoode, another resident. Ninny tells Evelyn stories of her youth in Whistle Stop in 1927 and succeeding years. Between subsequent visits, Evelyn begins to adopt aspects of figures in these stories as role models.

Ninny says she was an orphan raised by the Threadgoodes, and that she eventually married one of their sons. She principally talks about the youngest daughter, Imogene &quot;Idgie&quot; Threadgoode, an unrepentant tomboy who became reclusive after her brother, Buddy, was killed on the railway. 

Ruth Jamison comes to live with the Threadgoodes while teaching at the Vacation Bible School. Idgie becomes enamored of her and is saddened when Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett. Frank turns out to be a violent, abusive man who often beats Ruth, but she stays with him until her mother&#x27;s death. Afterward, Ruth sends Idgie a message appealing for help. Idgie, along with several men, rescue her and her son from Bennett. Intimidated by Big George—the Threadgoodes&#x27; handyman—Bennett does not resist.

With money from her father, Idgie establishes the Whistle Stop Cafe, with Sipsey (Big George&#x27;s adoptive mother) and her daughter-in-law Onzell as cooks. Idgie becomes secondary guardian to Ruth&#x27;s son, Buddy Jr. A gossip columnist refers to him as &quot;Ruth and Idgie&#x27;s son&quot;, indicating recognition of the women&#x27;s alternative family. Buddy becomes known as &#x27;Stump&#x27; after losing an arm in an accident. The café quickly becomes known to hobos all over the US during the Great Depression as a welcoming place to receive a meal. The most recurrent guest is &quot;Smokey Lonesome&quot; Phillips, who secretly loves Ruth. When Ruth dies of cancer, Idgie is heartbroken.

After the railroad yard closes, the cafe (and ultimately the town) ceases operation. Several years later, Idgie and Big George are arrested by the county for Frank Bennett&#x27;s murder. The case is dismissed when the local minister, repaying Idgie for helping his son, falsely testifies she and Big George were at a three-day revival when Bennett went missing. Bennett&#x27;s body was never found. It is later revealed that Sipsey killed him when he attempted to kidnap his and Ruth&#x27;s son. His remains were barbecued by Big George and fed to the detectives investigating Frank&#x27;s disappearance at the time. 

Stump recounts the stories of his guardians to his daughter and granddaughter. Big George&#x27;s sons, Jasper and Artis, take independent paths: Jasper as a Pullman porter and Artis as a gambler and . After the decline of Whistle Stop, Idgie and her brother Julian relocated to Florida, where they operated a roadside food stand.

Inspired by these stories, Evelyn starts working outside the home, selling Mary Kay Cosmetics. At Mrs. Threadgoode&#x27;s urging, she gets treated for negative symptoms of menopause. She also confronts various long-held fears. Evelyn becomes happier. While on vacation, she receives a letter from Mrs. Hartman, a neighbor of Mrs. Threadgoode, telling her of the latter&#x27;s death and of her having bequeathed various trinkets to Evelyn.

==Themes==
Although Idgie and Ruth&#x27;s relationship is not explicitly described as lesbian, every resident both knows about it and accepts it; lesbianism is a theme in the novel.

The novel explores women&#x27;s aging through the characters of Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode. Evelyn goes through menopause and Mrs. Threadgoode deteriorates with age. As the novel follows Sipsey&#x27;s family, it analyzes the stark challenges they and other African Americans faced in society from the 1920s to the late 1980s. Memories and storytelling are important elements of the novel. The moral justifications of murder and euthanasia are touched upon.

Food is another literary theme in the novel. At the end of the book, Flagg included the recipes served by the cafe (including their signature fried green tomatoes).

==Development==
The &quot;Whistle Stop Cafe&quot; is loosely based on the Irondale Cafe in Irondale, Alabama, a suburb near Flagg&#x27;s birthplace. The cafe was bought by Flagg&#x27;s aunt, Bess Fortenberry, in 1932 and run for four decades by her and two friends. It is still operating and, like the fictional cafe, is known for its fried green tomatoes.

== Reception ==

&quot;Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe&quot; spent 36 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List. 

Harper Lee praised the book in the publisher&#x27;s Reader&#x27;s Guide, saying, &quot;Airplanes and television have removed the Threadgoodes from the Southern scene. Happily for us, Fannie Flagg has preserved a whole community of them in a richly comic, poignant narrative that records the exuberance of their lives, the sadness of their departure. Idgie Threadgoode is a true original: Huckleberry Finn would have tried to marry her!&quot;

==Adaptations==
Flagg and Carol Sobieski wrote the screenplay for adaptation of the novel as a film, &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;, released in 1991. It is directed by Jon Avnet and stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker and Cicely Tyson. The film adaptation is a story within a story of Southern female friendship and love.

The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and received an award from the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD).

In October 2020 it was reported that NBC was developing a television series adaptation of the film/novel. The series was to be produced by Universal Television with Norman Lear as executive producer and Jennifer Cecil as writer and executive producer. Reba McEntire was an executive producer and would have a starring role. However, in 2021 it was decided the show would not move forward.

<text>Judson Harmon (February 3, 1846February 22, 1927) was an American Democratic politician from Ohio. He served as United States Attorney General under President Grover Cleveland and later served as the 45th governor of Ohio.

==Early life==
Harmon was born in Newtown, Ohio and named after Adoniram Judson, the famed American Baptist foreign missionary. His parents were Benjamin Franklin Harmon and Julia Brunson, a native of Olean, New York. His ancestors on both sides of his family were English and included men who served in the colonial wars and the American Revolutionary War, including Cornelius Brooks and his father James Brooks.

Judson was a distant relative of Frances Folsom, the wife of President Grover Cleveland, through her mother Emma Harmon.

Harmon graduated from Denison University in 1866. He graduated from the Cincinnati Law School and was admitted to the bar in 1869. Harmon was elected judge of the Common Pleas Court in 1876 but left months later to run unsuccessfully for the State Senate. He was elected judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati in 1878 and served until he resigned in 1887 to resume the practice of law.

==Attorney General==
He was appointed Attorney General by President Cleveland on June 8, 1895, upon the elevation of Richard Olney to become United States Secretary of State. Harmon served out the remainder of Cleveland&#x27;s second term in office. Shortly after his appointment, Harmon urged Congress to fix some of the weaknesses in the Sherman Antitrust Act. Harmon also issued the most explicit statement of what became known as the Harmon doctrine of absolute sovereignty, &quot;the rules, principles and precedents of international law impose no liability or obligation upon the United States&quot; in a case involving a claim by Mexico for damages from diverting the waters of the Rio Grande.

==Governor==

Harmon was elected as Ohio governor in 1908. In 1910, Harmon was re-elected for a second term as governor, this time defeating future President of the United States Warren G. Harding. During his time as governor, various progressive labor laws were introduced.

===Presidential candidate===
In June 1912, Harmon led the Ohio delegation to the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland. There, Harmon was nominated as a candidate for the presidency. That was largely as a favorite son of the State of Ohio, Harmon found support from elsewhere and on the first ballot of the Convention, and he received the votes of 148 delegates. However, since no candidate received the necessary two thirds of the votes, balloting continued.

By the time of the 26th ballot, no candidate had yet received the nomination for president and Harmon&#x27;s support had dwindled to 29 votes, as the Convention tended to coalesce around the two leading candidates: Speaker of the House of Representatives Champ Clark of Missouri and New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson. Balloting continued until the 39th ballot, when the support of William Jennings Bryan helped Wilson obtain the votes necessary to become the nominee.

===Retirement===
Following the convention, Harmon returned home to Ohio to serve the rest of his term as governor. Accordingly, Harmon left office in January 1913 upon completing this second term. he died in late February 1927 at 81.

===Family===
In 1870 Judson married Olivia Scobey, the daughter of a leading physician in Hamilton. They had three daughters. Harmon and family were residents of Wyoming, OH and lived at 205 Worthington Avenue, located in the city&#x27;s Village Historic District. He served as Wyoming&#x27;s third Mayor and was the village&#x27;s most distinguished public servant.

==Legacy==
Harmon County, Oklahoma, is named after him.

<text>Zohar Manna (1939 – 30 August 2018) was an Israeli-American computer scientist who was a professor of computer science at Stanford University.

== Biography ==
He was born in Haifa, Mandatory Palestine in 1939. He earned his Bachelor of Science (BS) and Master of Science (MS) degrees from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology.

He attended Carnegie Mellon University and earned his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in computer science in 1968.

Manna returned to Israel in 1972 as a professor of applied mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science. He became a full professor at Stanford in 1978. He remained affiliated with the Weizmann Institute of Science until 1995. He continued to work as a Stanford professor until retirement in 2010.

== Books ==
He authored nine books. &quot;The Mathematical Theory of Computation&quot; (McGraw Hill, 1974; reprinted Dover, 2003) is one of the first texts to provide extensive coverage of the mathematical concepts behind computer programming.

With Amir Pnueli, he co-authored an unfinished trilogy of textbooks on temporal logic and verification of reactive systems: &quot;The Temporal Logic of Reactive and Concurrent Systems: Specification&quot; (Springer-Verlag, 1991), &quot;The Temporal Logic of Reactive and Concurrent Systems: Safety&quot; (Springer-Verlag, 1995) and &quot;The Temporal Logic of Reactive and Concurrent Systems: Progress&quot; (unpublished; first three chapters posted at http://theory.stanford.edu/~zm/tvors3.html).

With Aaron R. Bradley he co-authored a textbook, The Calculus of Computation, that serves as an introduction to both first-order logic and formal verification.

== Awards ==
In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2016, he shared the Herbrand Award with Richard Waldinger for his &quot;″pioneering research and pedagogical contributions (with Richard Waldinger) to automated reasoning, program synthesis, planning, and formal methods″&quot;. He received the Bauer Prize from the Technical University of Munich, and an honorary doctorate from the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan.

== Advising ==
He supervised 30 doctoral students, including Nachum Dershowitz, Adi Shamir, Thomas Henzinger, Pierre Wolper, and Martín Abadi.

<text>Stanley Cohen (23 February 1942 – 7 January 2013) was a sociologist and criminologist, Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics, known for breaking academic ground on &quot;emotional management&quot;, including the mismanagement of emotions in the form of sentimentality, overreaction, and emotional denial. He had a lifelong concern with human rights violations, first growing up in South Africa, later studying imprisonment in England and finally in Israel. He founded the Centre for the Study of Human Rights at the London School of Economics.

==Life==
Cohen was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1942, son of a Lithuanian businessman. He grew up as a Zionist and intended to settle in Israel. He studied Sociology and Social Work as an undergraduate at the University of Witwatersrand, getting involved in anti-apartheid issues.

He came to London in 1963, where he worked as a social worker, before completing his PhD at London School of Economics (LSE) about the social reactions to juvenile delinquency. The Mods and Rockers youth riots were then occurring at England&#x27;s southern seaside towns, which he studied in the sensational press reactions and by direct interviews. 
From 1967, he lectured sociology briefly at the Enfield College, NE London, and then at Durham University. During this time of the student rebellions of 1968 he was influenced by the anti-psychiatry movement and participated in the National Deviancy Symposium.
A project in Durham prison with Laurie Taylor from York, led to their publication of three books, namely &quot;Psychological Survival: The Experience of Long-term Imprisonment&quot; (1972), &quot;Escape Attempts&quot; (1976), &quot;Prison Secrets&quot; (1978) and the later &quot;Visions of Social Control: Crime, Punishment and Classification&quot; (1985) which Cohen wrote alone.

From 1972 until 1980 he worked as Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex.

In 1980, he moved with his family to Israel, where he became the Director of the Institute of Criminology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He worked with human rights organisations campaigning against torture and dealing with the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

He returned to England in 1996 after being diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and was appointed Martin White Professor of Sociology at LSE, where he worked until retirement in 2005. In 1998 Cohen was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 2003 he received an honorary doctorate from University of Essex, and in 2008 from Middlesex University. In 2009 he was the first recipient of an Outstanding Achievement Award from the British Society of Criminology. He died on 7 January 2013 from consequences of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Work==
Cohen was a leading writer on criminology and sociology.

===&quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panic&quot; (1972)===
Cohen&#x27;s 1972 study (&quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;) of the UK popular media and social reaction to the Mods and Rockers phenomenon is widely regarded by British criminologists as one of the most influential works in the field in the last forty years. The work applied the concepts of labelling, societal reaction and the notion of the Deviancy Amplification Spiral. It helped to shift the focus of Criminology away from the causes of crime towards social reaction, the sociology of crime and Social Control. Cohen suggested the media overreact to an aspect of behaviour which may be seen as a challenge to existing social norms. However, the media response and representation of that behaviour actually helps to define it, communicate it and portrays it as a model for outsiders to observe and adopt. So the moral panic by society represented in the media arguably fuels further socially unacceptable behaviour.
Although Cohen is credited with coining the term &quot;moral panic&quot; the term is quite old - for instance an early usage can be found in the Quarterly Christian Spectator in 1830 and it was used by the Canadian communications theorist Marshall McLuhan in 1964.

===&quot;States of Denial&quot; (2001)===
Cohen&#x27;s last book &quot;States of Denial: Knowing about Atrocities and Suffering&quot; attempts to analyze personal and political ways in which humans avoid uncomfortable realities, like poverty, suffering, injustice. In 11 chapters he examines elementary forms of denial, Knowing and Not-Knowing: The Psychology of Denial (How could people simultaneously know and not know about such matters?), Denial at Work: Mechanisms and Rhetorical Devices, Accounting for Atrocities: Perpetrators and Officials, Blocking Out the Past: Personal Memories, Public Histories, Bystander States (Though ignorance is bliss, to what extent is a bystander a perpetrator?, Images of Suffering, Appeals: Outrage Into Action, Digging Up Graves, Opening Wounds: Acknowledging the Past, Acknowledgement Now (societal and personal transformation) and concludes with Loose Ends.

The book has been highly praised by reviewers in the English speaking world. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;He leads the reader to the conclusion that it is denial that is &#x27;normal&#x27; and an ability to see the truth and act accordingly which is rare, whether in individuals or in governments.&quot; Michael Ignatieff said &quot;this book will become the starting point for all future debate on the subject&quot;. 

States of Denial is an influential book on how people are in denial about racial oppression, slavery and other suffering. Cohen explains how many people, throughout this country, know that racial oppressive acts occur yet deny it. He writes how it seems as if these people only want to signify and realize things that they want, not actual reality. He says that people do know yet do not know that there is suffering and oppression, as if they choose to ignore it rather than talk about such an uneasy topic. Many people assume, and sometimes witness these acts occur, yet when asked will deny anything ever happened. Stanley Cohen writes about how people act blind to reality, due to uncomfortable and uneasy topics. According to Cohen, many people are in touch with the fact that racial oppression still occurs, along with other acts of human suffering, yet deny that those actions happen. The topic of racial oppression being such an uncomfortable topic makes it hard for many to acknowledge that it actually happens to this day. Stanley Cohen&#x27;s point of the book is to bring awareness to those who do not see the truth being mass incarceration and how society is structured. He wants people to realize how much people choose to ignore in society today, and that it needs to change.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Cohen married Ruth Kretzmer. She died in 2003; As of 2013, they were survived by their two daughters Judith and Jessica.

Laurie Taylor commented on his personality this way: &quot;He could be cruel about the pedants and time-servers he met along the way, intolerant of those who modified their political principles as they gained promotion.&quot;
Cohen&#x27;s love of jokes and self-deprecating humor is exemplified in an anecdote when Taylor mentioned cutting down drinking during their next academic collaboration, like Richard Burton, who said that he &quot;could see the world as it really was&quot;, to which Cohen replied &quot;That&#x27;s all very well, but who the hell wants to see the world as it really is?&quot;.

<text>Stanley Cohen (November 17, 1922 – February 5, 2020) was an American biochemist who, along with Rita Levi-Montalcini, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986 for the isolation of nerve growth factor and the discovery of epidermal growth factor. He died in February 2020 at the age of 97.

==Early life and education==
Cohen was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 17, 1922. He was the son of Fannie (née Feitel) and Louis Cohen, a tailor. His parents were Jewish immigrants. Cohen received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1943 from Brooklyn College, where he had double-majored in chemistry and biology. After working as a bacteriologist at a milk processing plant to earn money, he received his Master of Arts in zoology from Oberlin College in 1945. He earned a doctorate from the department of biochemistry about the metabolism of earthworms at the University of Michigan in 1948.

==Career==
His first academic employment was at the University of Colorado studying the metabolism of premature babies. In 1952 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, working first in the department of radiology, learning isotope methodology, and then in the department of zoology. Working with Rita Levi-Montalcini, he isolated nerve growth factor. He later isolated a protein that could accelerate incisor eruption and eyelid opening in newborn mice, which was renamed epidermal growth factor. He continued research on cellular growth factors after joining the faculty of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1959.

In 1999, Cohen retired from Vanderbilt University.

==Awards and legacy==
Cohen received the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Rita Levi-Montalcini in 1983, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986 for the isolation of nerve growth factor and the discovery of epidermal growth factor and the National Medal of Science in 1986.
His research on cellular growth factors has proven fundamental to understanding the development of cancer and designing anti-cancer drugs.

His Scopus &quot;h&quot;-index value was 82 as of March 2022.

<doc id="699550" wikidata="Q4385016" url="?curid=699550" title="Saimin">
<text>Saimin is a noodle soup dish common in the contemporary cuisine of Hawaii. Traditionally consisting of soft wheat egg noodles served in a hot garnished with diced green onions and a thin slice of , modern versions of saimin include additional toppings such as &quot;char siu&quot;, sliced Spam, sliced egg, bok choy, mushrooms, or shredded nori. When Chinese dumplings are added to the noodle soup, it is seen on menus as the heartier &quot;wonton min&quot;. All saimin establishments have their own, often secret recipe for the soup base, but primarily use and dried shrimp as major ingredients. Common table condiments mixed in the saimin broth are Chinese hot mustard and soy sauce, added in small quantities according to each individual&#x27;s taste. Many local residents of Hawaii also enjoy barbecued teriyaki beef sticks (skewers) or American hamburgers as a side dish.

Saimin was developed during Hawaii&#x27;s plantation era and is a testament to the history of cultural influences found in the Hawaiian Islands. It is a local comfort food eaten all year round at any time of day for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or as a late-night snack. Initially consumed by the working class, saimin can now be seen on the menus of Hawaii&#x27;s restaurants from fast food chains to upscale five-star hotel restaurants. It is commonly eaten at sporting events as well, with concession stands offering the hot noodle soup alongside popcorn and nachos. Saimin is also available as a pre-cooked packaged food much like instant ramen.

==History==
===Etymology===
&quot;Saimin&quot; is a compound of two Chinese words: (), meaning small, and (), meaning noodle. The word derives from the Cantonese language, reflecting the immigration of Chinese people from Guangdong to Hawaii. The word &quot;saimin&quot; is still used commonly in written Cantonese today. The first recorded use of the romanized word in Hawaii dates as far back as 1908, but was most likely spoken in the local dialect much earlier. In Hawaii&#x27;s contemporary pidgin language, saimin has become a hyponym or blanket term for noodle soups, particularly instant ramen (e.g., &quot;And one day, I come home from school and Blu and Maisie are eating dry saimin sprinkled with the soup stock&quot;).

===Origin===
The precise origins of saimin as a dish is debatable. The clash of cultures in Hawaii makes it difficult to precisely pinpoint the exact beginning of saimin, but in turn makes this dish unique with roots set deeply in Hawaii&#x27;s history. The earliest records of saimin identified the dish as being Chinese in origin. Many newspaper clippings of Hawaii&#x27;s yesteryears mentioning saimin are also exclusively associated with the Chinese population and their neighborhoods. The majority of these associations are also subtly derogatory, suggesting a less desirable, low-class representation of their community. That being so, it may become a sensitive issue crediting Chinese immigrants with saimin&#x27;s origins even with strong written evidence behind this theory.

It is certain that saimin, along with much of the contemporary cuisine in Hawaii, is closely related to the immigration of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Portuguese field workers during the plantation era of Hawaii beginning in the 1850s. As the popular belief goes, these plantation laborers of various ethnic backgrounds would return from the fields and share communal meals. For example, a Korean family may have had extra green onions growing in their yard, the Portuguese would have some extra pork from making sausage, the Chinese would share some noodles, while the Japanese provide some for the meal. At this point, they would all throw their ingredients into a pot and share what was created. It may be through these improvised communal meals that saimin was possibly born. This common, yet supposed history of saimin&#x27;s origins is highly debatable, since there are recorded accounts of much racial tension between the various ethnic groups during this time. Interracial activity was highly limited and the groups were more than often segregated, leaving little chance for these imagined communal meals.

Among the immigrant population in Hawaii, one of the largest (besides the Chinese) and most influential (besides the Caucasian) immigrants were the Japanese and it is theorized that saimin was created by this ethnic group wanting to eat ramen. Instead of a full replication, they were limited to the ingredients readily available to them in Hawaii, resulting in the creation of saimin. There are records of Japanese immigrants peddling saimin in Hawaii as early as 1915, giving them a decent standing as its fore-bearer. However, the Japanese ramen theory also has many complications and anachronisms. During the same time period, ramen was not the widely popular phenomenon in Japan as it is known today and would not be considered a food Japanese immigrants immediately associate with their homeland. To drive this point further, if indeed Japanese immigrants were attempting to recreate ramen in Hawaii, the common Japanese language did not use the word until about the 1950s. In Japan it was first known as , as the ramen itself was a dish with Chinese origins. Saimin noodles themselves are closer in characteristic to the curly yellow-colored Chinese egg noodles found in wonton noodles as opposed to the straight white wheat noodles consumed in Japan, giving Chinese immigrants an edge as the first developers of saimin.

===Initial appearance===
Saimin was first sold as a menu item in the early 1900s from unmarked and unnamed &#x27;saimin wagons&#x27; as &quot;an immigrant family&#x27;s first step into American entrepreneurship&quot;. The noodles, broth, and toppings were made from scratch and prepared by hand in their homes. With all the components ready to assemble and serve, they would wheel out to a spot wherever there were plantation laborers looking for a cheap and quick bite to eat. As these families earned more money, they were able to set up shop at fixed locations. The first of these saimin stands could be found near the old plantation towns and farms of Hawaii as early as the 1930s, feeding hungry fieldworkers for as little as $0.05 a bowl.

===Post-plantation popularization===
As Hawaii gradually moved from an agricultural economy towards a more service-based economy in the 1960s and 1970s, saimin stands moved away from the plantation fields with many more establishments opening near sporting venues, movie theaters, pool halls, and schools. Due to its timely preparation and warm broth, it became popular as a quick late night snack for young adults after a night out on the town. Also at this time several public schools throughout Hawaii began offering saimin as a regular option for students who did not want to eat the scheduled weekly menu.

It was not until the opening of Honolulu Stadium and its addition to the concession stand&#x27;s menu when saimin became acknowledged as a popular fast food and put under a national spotlight. Chuck Tanner, retired Major League Baseball player for the Boston Braves and former manager of minor league baseball team the Hawaii Islanders in 1969 and 1970, recalled, &quot;During the games, fans ate corn on the cob. They had some soup. . . won ton or something. I don&#x27;t know. And they had these sticks with beef on them.&quot;

===Modern period===
Saimin became less popular in the 1980s and 1990s as the appearance of other exciting noodle soup dishes made their way to Hawaii such as tonkotsu ramen and pho. As other forms of noodle soup grew in popularity, many saimin institutions closed, leaving saimin as a comfort food of nostalgic value to the older generation in Hawaii.

===Historic saimin establishments===
Several saimin establishments including saimin noodle factories and restaurants have become local landmarks in Hawaii and have attracted out-of-state visitors venturing off the traditional tourist-beaten paths. There are many that have closed their doors, such as Shiroma&#x27;s Saimin in Waipahu, Washington Saimin in Makiki, Hall Saimin in Kalihi, Likelike Drive In, and most recently Dillingham Saimin (formally known as Boulevard Saimin). Some local institutions still in existence with decades under their belts are Jane&#x27;s Fountain, The Old Saimin House, Palace Saimin, Meg&#x27;s Drive In, Shiro&#x27;s Saimin Haven, Forty-Niner Restaurant, and Sekiya&#x27;s Restaurant &amp; Delicatessen on Oahu. Also notable are Nori&#x27;s Saimin &amp; Snacks on the Big Island, Sam Sato&#x27;s on Maui, and Hamura&#x27;s Saimin on Kauai, which was given the James Beard Foundation&#x27;s America&#x27;s Classic honor in 2006.

==McDonald&#x27;s saimin==
McDonald&#x27;s, an American fast-food giant based in Oak Brook, Illinois, became aware of the saimin phenomenon in the Hawaiian islands in the late 1960s. Maurice J. &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan, legendary Hawaii entrepreneur and owner of Foodland Super Market Limited, had purchased and opened the first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in Hawaii in 1968 at his flagship grocery store. He opened several more McDonald&#x27;s franchises, and for 12 straight months, McDonald&#x27;s Hawaii became the highest-grossing group of franchises in the world. Sullivan wanted to serve his favorite meal, saimin, at his McDonald&#x27;s restaurants, knowing all too well that his restaurants would boom with its introduction to the menu.

Sullivan invited executives from the McDonald&#x27;s corporation, including owner and business tycoon Ray Kroc for dinner at two family-owned, &quot;hole-in-the-wall&quot; saimin stands in Honolulu: Washington Saimin and Boulevard Saimin. That night, Sullivan convinced Kroc to expand McDonald&#x27;s menu for the first time in its corporate history to include a local &quot;ethnic&quot; food. Researchers worked extensively with Washington Saimin to develop a recipe for McDonald&#x27;s Hawaii. Sullivan secured deals with Ajinomoto, a local Japanese saimin noodle factory and fishcake supplier, to manufacture a special soup base.

Saimin was one of McDonald&#x27;s Hawaii&#x27;s most popular menu items. Later, Sullivan introduced breakfast platters consisting of Portuguese sausage, eggs, and steamed white rice; Spam, eggs, and rice; and a Breakfast deluxe, a combination of the two, to his menu, capitalizing on the local food phenomena.

On June 29, 2022, McDonald&#x27;s Hawaii announced that it would no longer offer saimin on its menu. The item was discontinued because Okahara Saimin, the chain&#x27;s supplier, closed due to its owners&#x27; retirement at the end of May.

==S&amp;S saimin==
Much like its close counterpart ramen, saimin was also developed as an instant noodle in 1963 by Shimoko &amp; Sons saimin brand, better known to locals as S&amp;S saimin. Unlike instant ramen, S&amp;S saimin noodles require refrigeration or freezing and are not dry. The noodles are also pre-cooked, making it a ready-to-eat food by simply adding hot water with a soup base packaged separately. Instant saimin has since become a staple in many Hawaii households because of its quick and easy preparation, in addition allowing the consumer to add any toppings they desire.

S&amp;S is a large contributor to popularizing saimin since the name brand sponsored many local television shows between the late 1960s and early 1980s. During this time, S&amp;S sent 20 children to Disneyland through a contest held with the beloved children&#x27;s program, The Checkers and Pogo Show. The saimin brand also sponsored the &quot;S&amp;S Junk Show&quot;, a karaoke-based amateur singing program which ran for 15 seasons.

The S&amp;S saimin brand was acquired by the Japanese multinational drink company Ito En in 1987. The brand was later sold to Hawaii-based noodle and pasta manufacturer Sun Noodle in 2006.

==Variations==
Some saimin establishments may have the option to substitute the traditional thin egg noodles for the thicker udon noodle, or sometimes mixing both, creating something seen on local menus as &quot;saidon&quot;. A soup-less pan-fried version similar to Japanese yakisoba and Chinese lo mein is simply known as &quot;fried saimin&quot;. This variation is particularly popular at carnivals, fairgrounds, and catered parties since it can be prepared in large quantities and consumed at room temperature. &quot;Fried saimin&quot; is also served as a side dish in okazuya bento and plate lunch.

<doc id="699554" wikidata="Q8003381" url="?curid=699554" title="Willard Brown">
<text>Willard Jessie Brown (June 26, 1915 – August 4, 1996) was an American baseball player who played as an outfielder in the Negro Leagues for the Kansas City Monarchs and in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Browns, where he was one of the league&#x27;s first African American players. Often called &quot;Home Run Brown&quot; for making history as the first Black ballplayer to hit a home run in the American League, Brown&#x27;s other nicknames included &quot;Sonny&quot;, due to his preference for crowded Sunday games, and &quot;Ese Hombre&quot; (&quot;That Man&quot;), due to his offensive dominance playing in the Puerto Rican Winter League.

For the Monarchs, Brown led the Negro American League in hits for eight seasons (1937–39, 1941–43, 1946, 1948) and runs batted in (RBI) seven times during his career. His eight times leading a league in hits is tied with Ty Cobb for most in baseball history while his seven times leading in RBI for a league is tied for second-most in baseball history with Josh Gibson; Gibson and Brown also finished in the top two in batting average in five seasons each, the most in Negro league history. 

In 1947, Willard Brown and fellow Monarchs player Hank Thompson both signed with the St. Louis Browns, becoming the third and fourth Black ballplayers in the MLB and marking the first time two African Americans played as teammates on the same MLB team. Brown is a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Shreveport, Louisiana on 26 June 1915. He grew up in Natchitoches, Louisiana and in Shreveport. Brown&#x27;s father was a mill laborer who became the owner of a cabinetmaking shop. Brown was a batboy in spring training for the Kansas City Monarchs, as the Negro league team held its workouts in Shreveport.

==Baseball career==
He began his baseball career in with the Monroe Monarchs, a minor Negro league team in the Negro Southern League. In , he signed with the Kansas City Monarchs, for which he would play in six out of the next eight years. A rookie season of 56 games played with a .379 batting average, ten home runs, 81 hits, and 60 RBI (for which he led the latter three categories) proved to be the beginning of a career full of raw power.

During his pre-war baseball years, he established himself as having the most raw power in Negro league history, and possibly in the history of baseball. He hit home runs more often than the better known Josh Gibson, causing Gibson to give Brown his nickname.

He also hit for a batting average of .374 in and regularly hitting over .350. Brown was one of the fastest players in baseball in the late 1930s and 1940s, as well as a solid outfielder. From 1937 to 1946, Brown helped lead the Monarchs to six pennants in ten seasons. He finished second in batting average three times during this period (1937, 1939, 1943).

Brown left the Monarchs for the first time in 1940, swayed by the Mexican Leagues (as devised by Jorge Pasquel), who raided 63 players with the promise of more money ($1,000 per month); Brown played in Nuevo Laredo.

In the 1942 season, the Monarchs met the Negro National League champion Homestead Grays in the 1942 Negro World Series, the first Negro World Series between the Negro American League and the Negro National League since 1927. Brown stole a base in Game 2 and hit a home run in Game 3 while collecting seven hits in sixteen combined at-bats in four official games (an exhibition game and a game later not counted by the league was also played).

In the winter of 1941-42, he moved to the Puerto Rican leagues in Humacao. He also played parts of 1943-44 in the California Winter League. He served in the U.S. Army in 1944, seeing service in Europe before returning to the Monarchs in 1946 after being released from duty as a technician fifth grade. He batted .371 in 1947, leading the league for the first and only time.

Like many players of this era, in 1944 Brown left baseball to serve for two years in the U.S. Army during WWII. In 1946 he would return to play for the Monarchs for another year, when everything changed Jackie Robinson broke the MLB&#x27;s color barrier.

=== MLB career ===
In 1947, mere months after Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the floundering St. Louis Browns signed both Willard Brown and Monarchs teammate Hank Thompson. This made them the third and fourth Black ballplayers in MLB history and made the St. Louis Browns the first MLB team with two Black players on their roster. The &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported at the time that of all the Black players signed by MLB teams that season, &quot;Outfielder Brown was considered to be the prize package of the lot, with only his age against him. 

On July 20th 1947, Brown and Thompson both played for St. Louis against the Boston Red Sox. This marked the first time in history that two black players appeared in an MLB game together playing for the same team. 

Brown entered the baseball record books again on August 13, 1947, when he became the first African-American player to hit a home run in the American League: an inside-the-park homer off Detroit Tigers pitcher and future Hall of Famer Hal Newhouser. 

Brown&#x27;s time in the MLB would be unfortunately brief - after two years spent enlisted in the U.S. Army during WWII, he wasn&#x27;t able to match the physical prowess he had previously shown in the Negro Leagues and in Mexico and Puerto Rico during the winter off-seasons. But the biggest obstacle was racism - St. Louis was the southernmost team in Major League Baseball at the time and Brown and Thompson faced much more discrimination and hostility from their own teammates than Jackie Robinson or Larry Doby did from their teammates on the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cleveland Indians, respectively.

Throughout the season Brown struggled from racism in his new surroundings, hitting .179 in just 21 games between July 19 and August 21 before he was released.

===Later career===
That winter, Brown went to Puerto Rico and had one of his greatest seasons ever, batting .432 with 27 home runs and 86 RBI in just 60 games, winning the Triple Crown and earning the nickname &quot;Ese Hombre&quot; or &quot;That Man&quot;. He then won the Puerto Rican Winter League Triple Crown in the 1949–1950 season, and also hit for the cycle once in his career.

He returned to the Monarchs for the 1948 season (the last before the Negro leagues started to decline in terms of player quality). He played in 44 games and batted .404 while having 67 hits and 53 RBI, with the latter two topping the league totals once again (he finished second in batting average for the fourth and final time). His career home run total is not known, but he is considered to be among the Negro league career leaders in homers despite a relatively brief career.

He continued to play for a time with the Monarchs until the early 1950s while also still playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, where he won another Triple Crown in the winter of 1949-50. He played in Canada with the Border League for the Ottawa Nationals for a 30-game pennant run. He also played in the Caribbean Series in Venezuela along with summer ball in the Dominican Republic (1951–52). He then played in the Texas League and Western League from through . He finished his Puerto Rico play in 1956-57; he batted .350 in his career there and was named to the Puerto Rican Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991. He played in 1957 for the Minot Mallards of the Manitoba-Dakota League before closing out his career barnstorming with the Monarchs in 1958. He then retired to his home in Houston.

== Later life and legacy ==
Brown retired with the most times leading a league in Extra-base hits with eight, later tied by Hank Aaron.

After retiring from baseball, Brown was a long time resident of Houston, Texas. He died there in 1996 at the age of 81, after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for several years. Brown was interred at Houston National Cemetery on August 12, 1996.

He was featured on several baseball cards during his playing days, including ones from Toleteros that were inserts in packages of tobacco. Buck O&#x27;Neil described Brown as the &quot;most natural ballplayer I ever saw”.

Brown was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. The same year, he gained induction into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame as part of their first class.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Brown as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

<doc id="699555" wikidata="Q7269610" url="?curid=699555" title="Quavers">
<text>Quavers are a deep-fried potato-based British snack food. Launched in the UK in 1968, they were originally made by Smith&#x27;s in their factory on Newark Road in the Bracebridge area of Lincoln. Since 1997 they have been produced by Walkers. The name comes from the musical note, quaver.

==History==
Quavers were launched in 1968 with the advertising slogan &quot;you get a lovely lot of Quavers in a bag&quot;, described as &quot;curly potato puffs&quot;. The brand was originally sold in cheese and smoky bacon flavours, but over the years flavours like Spicy Beef, Sweet and Sour, Prawn Cocktail, and Ketchup were also part of the range.

In 1993, a Salt and Vinegar flavour was added to the range, and by this time, the packaging transitioned to the Walkers brand name.

Walkers, owned by PepsiCo, purchased the Quavers brand in July 1995, when it became one of the Frito Lay International brand names.

In 1996, a Tangy Tomato flavour was added to the range. By 1997, the brand was part of Walkers&#x27; short-lived &quot;Snackshack&quot; range, and was relaunched twice in April 1998 and in March 1999. In October 1998, the first relaunch coincided with the return of Prawn Cocktail with a new recipe (as such, was branded as &quot;New&quot;) replacing Tangy Tomato, while the second relaunch coincided with a newly refreshed Cheese flavour. Another packaging refresh took place in July 2000.

In August 2002, a &quot;Streaky Bacon&quot; flavour was added to the range, which contained pink and brown pieces, that resembled bacon.

In September 2004, Ghost-shaped Cheese Quavers were released for Halloween, and returned in September 2005.

In February 2007, Walkers changed the packaging for Quavers, Wotsits, Squares, French Fries and Monster Munch. This packaging reflected the usage of sunseed oil, which was used in all products. The Multipack bags were in a different layout, being in Landscape style. Quavers&#x27; logo was changed slightly, and the flavours remained the same.

In December 2009, Quavers, Wotsits, Squares, and French Fries all changed their packaging again to coincide with a &quot;99 Calories or Less&quot; range with a consumers&#x27; focus on “New Year New Me”. The Cheese flavour was reduced to 87 Calories for a standard pack.

In February 2011, Quavers packaging updated to a brighter bag colour with the Walkers logo on the packets again. After a while, the brand was sold in simply Cheese flavour.

In July 2013, the six-packs were reduced in size removing 30% of the wrapping but keeping the same amount of bags inside.

In August 2019, the packaging was updated alongside other Walkers Snacks, to inform about a reduction in plastic used on the packet.

In December 2020, Walkers announced that Prawn Cocktail and Salt and Vinegar would return to shelves in January 2021 due to popular demand.

== Description ==
The primary ingredient in Quavers is potato starch. They are deep fried to give a snack with a similar texture to krupuk (prawn crackers), but have a different flavour and are smaller with a curled-up rectangle shape (similar in cross-section to a quaver). 

The product line went on to introduce two other flavours, prawn cocktail and salt and vinegar. These were discontinued in 2012. Ketchup and sweet and sour flavours were also introduced, but for a limited time only and are no longer available. In January 2021, Quavers returned two long-lost flavours (prawn cocktail and salt &amp; vinegar) by popular demand.

A one pack (16.4 g) serving of regular Quavers contains 88 calories, of which 44 are from fat. Quavers contain a mixture of fats (4.9g): saturated fat 0.4g, polyunsaturated fat 0.6g and monounsaturated fat 3.8g. The sodium content is 170mg. Quavers have 86 calories in their Cheese flavour and 83 in the salt and vinegar variety.

<doc id="699562" wikidata="Q7038544" url="?curid=699562" title="Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution is an amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which permitted the state to be bound by the British–Irish Agreement (the bilateral portion of the Good Friday Agreement) and enabled the establishment of shared political institutions between Ireland and Northern Ireland. It also provided a mechanism for a further amendment to the Constitution upon a declaration by the government on the implementation of the Agreement, most notably by changing Articles 2 and 3 from the previous claim over the whole island of Ireland to an aspiration towards creating a united Ireland by peaceful means, &quot;with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island&quot;.

The amendment was effected by the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1998 (previously bill no. 24 of 1998) which was approved by referendum on 22 May 1998 and signed into law on 3 June of the same year. The referendum was held on the same day as a Northern Ireland referendum on the Good Friday Agreement and a second referendum in the Republic of Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Government declaration envisaged by the Nineteenth Amendment was made on 2 December 1999, bringing the changes to Articles 2 and 3 and certain other parts of the constitution into effect.

==Background==
The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 was a culmination of the Northern Ireland peace process. The agreement acknowledged nationalism and unionism as &quot;equally legitimate, political aspirations&quot;. It comprised two agreements: the Multi-Party Agreement, between the parties of Northern Ireland; and the British-Irish Agreement, between the government of Ireland and the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Constitution needed to be amended to allow the Irish state to be bound by its provisions.

The government of Ireland also agreed to amend Articles 2 and 3; however, these changes would only take effect if the government were satisfied that it could make a declaration that the Agreement had taken effect. These changes would remove the claim of the state to the whole island of Ireland, while also providing a mechanism for a poll on a united Ireland. The government of the United Kingdom agreed changes to legislation, which were to be provided in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, for a border poll on the status of Northern Ireland.

==Changes to the text==
===Initial changes after referendum (1998)===
The Nineteenth Amendment added the text below as Article 29.7 to the constitution. Subsection 3° provides the detail of the amendments to be made to the text and are detailed further below. The text of subsections 3°, 4° and 5°, shown here in italics, are omitted from the published text of the Constitution.
===Subsequent changes effected upon Government declaration (1999)===
Upon the declaration of the government on 2 December 1999, and under the terms of 29.7.3°, the following changes were made to the text:

Deletion of the entirety of Articles 2 and 3:

and substitution of the Articles with the following:
Insertion of the following as Article 29.8 (see extraterritorial jurisdiction in Irish law):
==Bill==
A lay litigant named Denis Riordan launched a High Court challenge to the bill the week before the referendum. He claimed the bill was invalid because it purported to allow a mechanism to amend the Constitution by government declaration rather than by referendum. The court rejected the challenge on the grounds that the initial amendment would be by referendum and that by separation of powers the courts could not interfere in the legislative process.

==Referendum result==


==After the referendum==
The referendum returning officer certified the result in the High Court, which notified the Oireachtas, and the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1998 was signed into law by the President on 3 June 1998. This &quot;ipso facto&quot; effected the insertion of Article 28.7 of the Constitution and started the clock for the 12-month window (Article 28.7.5°) within which the British-Irish Agreement would be ratified. The British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 served in Irish law to ratify the treaty and establish the associated cross-border institutions. The act was signed into law on 22 March 1999 but would not be commenced by the Taoiseach until the same date as the corresponding British law (the Northern Ireland Act 1998). Both were dependent on participation of the parties in Northern Ireland.

Political disagreements within Northern Ireland meant that establishment would not take place by the deadline of 2 June 1999, so the Oireachtas rushed through a 12-month extension (&quot;such longer period as may be provided for by law&quot; in Article 28.7.5°). A minor amendment to the British-Irish Agreement was signed on 18 June and the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 was accordingly amended on 25 June. The institutions were established on 2 December 1999, when the Irish government commenced the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 as amended, and the UK government simultaneously commenced the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The Irish government accordingly made the declaration specified by Article 28.7.3°, triggering the replacement of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, the insertion of Article 29.8, and the omission of the transitory subsections 3°–5° of Article 29.7.

==Later developments==
The provision in the amended Article 2 quoted above that &quot;It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation&quot; was affected by the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, passed in 2004. That amendment did not alter the text of Article 2 but instead inserted a new section in Article 9 which limited the constitutional right to citizenship by birth to individuals with at least one Irish-citizen parent.

<text>Bottega University is a for-profit, accredited distance learning university headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.

==Accreditation and institutional recognition==
Bottega University is nationally accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC), an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education.

Bottega University is also an institutional member of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), the American Council on Education (ACE), the Council for Adult &amp; Experiential Learning (CAEL) and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars &amp; Admissions Officers.

==History==
Bottega University was launched as Andrew Jackson University in 1994 by Robert McKim Norris Jr. and D. Michael Barrett, both graduates of the Cumberland School of Law and colleagues at a Birmingham, Alabama law firm. The school was designed as a university catering the needs of adult learners that was both accessible and affordable. Andrew Jackson University was founded as a not-for-profit. The first classes took place in 1994 in Birmingham, Alabama.

UniversityNow, Inc. acquired the school in December 2010 and officially changed its name to New Charter University in early 2011. As part of the transition, the university was reestablished in San Francisco, California as a for-profit institution. In June 2012, the university was awarded a grant from The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, through its Next Generation Learning Challenges organization, and the William &amp; Flora Hewlett Foundation to fund research into innovative delivery models in higher education that have the potential to generate high student outcomes at an affordable cost. UniversityNow&#x27;s funding to relaunch the university came from investors including Kapor Capital, University Ventures, Novak Biddle Venture Partners, Charles River Ventures, Greylock Partners, SV Angel, Floodgate, and 500 Global, with $42 million in total capital raised over four rounds, ending in September 2013. During an October 2013 interview regarding UniversityNow’s decision to pursue venture funding and eschew federal, Title IV, funds, UniversityNow co-founder and President Emerita of Mills College, Dr. Janet Holmgren, described its approach as having “married for-profit with social justice.”

In January 2015, the university relocated to Salt Lake City, Utah when it was acquired by Global Heritage Education and its parent, Knod Global Learning Foundation. Knod&#x27;s leadership and board included Graham Doxey, cofounder of Neumont College, William Hansen, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education, Dr. Henry Eyring, president of Brigham Young University, and Dr. Nicholas Donofrio, Connecticut Board of Regents Chair for Higher Education. Knod’s leadership and investors had successfully established new institutes of higher education in the United States, Malaysia, China, and Australia. The foundation’s stated mission was to help develop the global middle-class by enabling students, educators and employers to collaborate on real-world projects together, generating the hands-on experiences its graduates would need to jumpstart their careers. In May 2015, Knod announced an investment of $6.2 million and extended the university’s bachelor’s degree program to students in Africa. The program, launched in Kenya, offered sponsored, hybrid-online education, with a focus on project-based learning and corporate competencies development. In July 2015, the university signed an agreement with the European School of Economics to offer degrees in finance, management, and marketing, as well as internship programs located in London, New York, Rome, Milan, Florence, and Madrid.

In April 2018, New Charter and Bottega announced a strategic partnership to integrate their respective technologies to offer students a new software development learning management system and educational platform called Code Lab. During a keynote speech at Utah’s annual technology conference, Silicon Slopes, Bottega announced a donation of more than $5 million worth of Code Lab programs to high school students and teachers in Utah. The company further committed to donate another $5 million by the summer of 2024. According to Eric Wold, Bottega’s CEO at that time, the programs aimed to address the skills gap and the digital divide in the state, while also collecting insights to improve the companies’ learning platforms. Wold stated two main goals for the donations of coding programs to Utah. The first goal was to introduce coding to thousands of young people, especially young women, who made up more than one-third of the participants, and Wold indicated that this percentage was higher than the national average and that the participants learned advanced computer science skills. The second goal was to address the lack of instructors with computer science teaching credentials, which limited the availability of computer science classes in schools. Bottega said that it had received approval from the Utah State Board of Education to offer its training to public teachers for free. At the time of the announcement, 119 teachers had started the training, which the company expected to increase the number of computer science classes in Utah schools. Wold explained the motivation behind the donations as a belief that technology education could benefit everyone and that the private sector had a responsibility to contribute to the state’s economic and educational development; he credited Utah Governor Gary Herbert, with whom Wold announced the programs, for creating the favorable environment for novel educational programs such as these. In August 2019, following the public launch of the Code Lab, Global Heritage and the university were acquired by Bottega, LLC, and DEAC granted Bottega permission in June 2020 to change the university&#x27;s name to Bottega University.

In October 2019, Paul Ahlstrom of Alta Global Ventures announced an investment of $10 million in Bottega to train 6,000 students in Jamaica annually. The program, Coding Foundations, was designed to train 1,000 students in full stack engineering and 5,000 students in computer science. The first year of training was supported through the Bottega Perpetual Endowment Fund, partly funded by Ahlstrom and other investors at Alta Global Ventures.

In April 2020, the VASS Group, a global solutions consultancy headquartered in Madrid, announced that its foundation led an investment with Bottega to launch bilingual versions of its courses in Spain. The round was led by the VASS Foundation in partnership with the Adecco Foundation, the Mapfre Foundation, the Bankinter Foundation, the Universia Foundation, la Caixa Foundation, and the Endesa Foundation. The launch and partnership were crafted in response to the European Union&#x27;s deployment of the economic recovery programme Next Generation EU, which made boosting employable, digital skills among Spain&#x27;s population a top priority for the government. Starting in 2021, Spain&#x27;s Autonomous Communities and City Councils embarked on several actions. Madrid&#x27;s City Council and the VASS Foundation funded a selective and immersive training pilot in basic programming skills. For the pilot, 120 people were trained and introduced to the world of programming using Bottega&#x27;s devCamp LMS. In the second half of 2022, the Basque Employment Service, LANBIDE, with the support of the VASS Foundation, announced the Developers From Euskadi project, as a public-private partnership. The challenge was to train 400 unemployed citizens in the basics of programming in six weeks. Bottega&#x27;s Coding Foundations provided the platform to acquire basic knowledge of various programming languages through 60 hours of interactive lessons. All participants were to be graded on the outcomes of a web programming capstone project, and 100 of those students would graduate to a second, fully-funded, 600-hour full-stack specialisation provided by Bottega, together with local mentors and counselors to integrate the students into employment opportunities. The challenge was not a trivial one for the Basque region, which ranks near the top in Spain for per capita income, and the pilot experienced some challenges during rollout. Although the English-Spanish methodology allowed access to the original material with subtitles, and contact with specialist mentors was available in either language, the bilingual format was a deterrent for some students. Additionally, while accessing coursework was easier than attending in-person by removing the need to travel, this methodology required additional programme overhead, and online training was not common in Spain&#x27;s public programmes. Despite these challenges, the pilot was well received by the local government and program sponsors. Of the almost 600 applicants, 404 people were finally admitted and only 6.2% of the students dropped out of the experience. Of those who successfully completed, 46% were women. In the programme&#x27;s mandated completion surveys, students gave the experience an average score of 9.3 points out of 10, and the average mark achieved by the second-phase students was 9.1 out of 10. The success was such that the Basque Employment Service and the VASS Foundation increased funding to ensure that 200 people, not just the 100 originally planned, would take part in the second phase of training. As a result of these pilots&#x27; outcomes, in June 2023 the VASS Group extended the partnership with Bottega to launch a bilingual, global technology training campus. Coursework includes certifications in full stack development, agile project management, communication, and management.

==Academics==
Bottega University offers associate, bachelor’s, and master’s degree programs in business, communication, computer science, and technology. Specializations include entrepreneurship, finance, health care management, human resource management, marketing, and technology management. Certificates in business and full-stack development are offered as well.

=== Distance learning ===
From the time of its founding in 1994, the university has delivered all of its programs through distance learning, allowing students to learn remotely, without being physically present in a classroom. Its founders and subsequent leadership cited social justice factors including affordability, class mobility, and accessibility as being their primary motivators for this approach.

==== Virtual Learning Environment ====
For its relaunch in 2012 and through multiple funding rounds, the university developed a proprietary, online, virtual learning environment (VLE) to conduct courses, facilitate proctored examinations, and manage all student information, including applications and admissions. Historically, VLEs have been used in distance learning to facilitate the management of educational courses by teachers for their students. VLEs are digital spaces that include learning management systems, student information systems and other educational technology. Following the university’s rollout in Africa, faculty subsequently published research on the difficulties that virtual learning faced in developing countries, with Kenya as the basis for the study. The findings cited socio-economic factors, internet connectivity limitations from low public sector investment, and inadequate teacher training as critical factors that hindered broader virtual learning expansion for the region at the time.

For invigliation, Bottega utilizes virtual proctoring technology developed by then-president of Andrew Jackson University, Donald Kassner. With the acquisition by UniversityNow, Kasser spun-off the technology platform as a standalone company, Meazure Learning, which licenses its solution to education institutions including Athabasca University, the Law School Admissions Council, McGraw-Hill Education, University of Iowa, University of Mississippi, University of Texas - Austin, and Western Governor’s University.

With the funding it received from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Hewlett Foundation, UniversityNow undertook the development of its own competency-based learning management and student information systems. The LMS was featured in studies by Educause and awarded a grant by its Next Generation Learning Challenges program. After agreeing to the acquisition of New Charter by Global Heritage and the Knod Foundation, UniversityNow sold the LMS to National University for an undisclosed sum.

Bottega acquired coding learning management system, devCamp, in January 2017. The LMS delivers project-driven learning for software developers though the use of generative artificial intelligence and machine learning to produce learning content and assess student progress. In February 2017, Bottega announced at the Silicon Slopes technology conference that devCamp had trained more than twenty thousand students, and in August 2019, the university announced, at the same conference, that number had risen to forty thousand students.

=== Competency-based learning ===

With its relaunch in June 2012, the university redesigned its educational framework to utilize competency-based learning.

Competency-based learning (CBL) is a framework for teaching and assessment of learning that focuses on outcomes and real-world performance. In a CBL framework, students demonstrate their learned knowledge and skills in order to achieve specific competencies. The set of competencies for a specific course or at a specific educational institution is sometimes referred to as competency architecture.

CBL is an evolution from traditional educational models because it is learner-directed. In a CBL framework, students have more control over their learning and can therefore pace themselves. Additionally, CBL allows different students to move at varying paces within a course, which can help ensure that each student has the opportunity to master the material. CBL also focuses on the demonstration of competence when considering students&#x27; progress and measures it by formative assessments. This approach is different from traditional learning methods that use summative testing. Finally, CBL provides individualized support for students, which can help ensure that each student has the resources they need.

One of the biggest challenges with CBL is ensuring that the competencies being assessed are relevant and meaningful. Additionally, CBL requires a significant amount of time and effort to develop and implement. Despite these challenges, CBL has the potential to improve educational outcomes by ensuring that students are prepared for success in the workforce.

=== Project-based learning ===
With the rollout in Africa through the Knod Foundation, the university integrated a project-based learning model into its curricula. Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching and learning approach that emphasizes real-world problem-solving and collaboration over traditional delivery models. In a higher education context, PBL is a pedagogical approach that involves students working on projects that are designed to be complex and open-ended. These projects are often interdisciplinary and require students to apply knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines in order to solve real-world problems.

In a PBL framework, students work in teams to identify a problem or challenge, conduct research, develop a solution, and present their findings to an audience. The process of working on a project helps students develop a range of skills, including critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration. Additionally, PBL can help students develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and its relevance in real-world contexts. Knod’s method utilized sponsors from corporate environments who were mentors and coaches to the students in the program.

PBL can be an improvement over traditional educational models because it is learner-centered and emphasizes learner engagement over traditional delivery models. By working on projects that are relevant to their interests and goals, students have shown increased motivation to learn and are more likely to retain what they have learned. Additionally, PBL can help students develop a range of skills that are valued by employers, including teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.

==Schools and affiliations==
Bottega operates two schools, the College of Business and a Career Training Division. The curricula of the College of Business focus on professional competency development for adult learners; Institutional Learning Outcomes are used to assess analytical abilities, business knowledge, collaboration and adaptability, critical thinking skills, communication aptitude, social responsibility, personal ethics, and quantitative acumen. The curricula in the Career Training Division focus on technical competency in full-stack software development by emphasizing a project-based learning approach, including the delivery of capstones and the development of project portfolios. The university maintains academic and corporate university partnerships, including articulation agreements and opportunities to transfer credits among affiliate institutions through its partnership with Sophia Learning:

Bottega University is recognized by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) associate, the International Association of Universities (IAU). The IAU maintains UNESCO&#x27;s World Higher Education Database (WHED), an authoritative record of accredited higher education institutions, higher education systems, and credentials in 196 countries and territories. Each institution in the WHED has a unique identifier, the Global WHED ID, which is IAU-029669 for Bottega University. Bottega University&#x27;s presence in the WHED validates its accreditation and recognition with the global higher education community.

The United Nations and the IAU lead two higher education sustainability programs, Higher Education and Research for Sustainable Development (HESD) and the Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI), which focus on the critical role that higher education institutions play in achieving global sustainable development. HESD monitors trends, develops expertise, and shares knowledge related to the UN&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goals via peer-to-peer learning among higher education leaders globally, and it fosters whole-institution approaches at the leadership level to integrate sustainable development priorities. The IAU collaborates with international and national entities, including being a key partner of the UNESCO Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development. HESI is an open partnership between several United Nations entities and the higher education community, which includes hundreds of university networks, student organizations, and higher education institutions. The UN&#x27;s stated mission for HESI is to enhance the role of higher education institutions in advancing sustainable development.

Bottega University was advanced as a recognized member of HESI because of its direct contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The university&#x27;s admissions, tuition, and academic models were designed for inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, which support Sustainable Development Goal 4. Because Bottega University is operated entirely online, requiring neither printed materials such as textbooks, nor in-person participation, which would induce travel, shipments, construction, residency, and physical campus maintenance, the university follows sustainable consumption and production patterns, addressing Sustainable Development Goal 12. Bottega also advances United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, which focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages, through its medical and scientific leadership series, the Congresses.

== Lecture series ==
The university hosts an annual lecture series, The Congresses, offered to honors students pursuing careers in medicine, science, or technology. The series is chaired by Scientific Director, Dr. Mario Capecchi, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Speakers include Nobel Laureates, university deans, and leaders in scientific research and technology.

<doc id="699570" wikidata="Q5172857" url="?curid=699570" title="Correlation ratio">
<text>In statistics, the correlation ratio is a measure of the curvilinear relationship between the statistical dispersion within individual categories and the dispersion across the whole population or sample. The measure is defined as the &quot;ratio&quot; of two standard deviations representing these types of variation. The context here is the same as that of the intraclass correlation coefficient, whose value is the square of the correlation ratio.

==Definition==

Suppose each observation is &quot;yxi&quot; where &quot;x&quot; indicates the category that observation is in and &quot;i&quot; is the label of the particular observation. Let &quot;nx&quot; be the number of observations in category &quot;x&quot; and
:formula_1 and formula_2

where formula_3 is the mean of the category &quot;x&quot; and formula_4 is the mean of the whole population. The correlation ratio η (eta) is defined as to satisfy

:formula_5

which can be written as
:formula_6
i.e. the weighted variance of the category means divided by the variance of all samples.
If the relationship between values of formula_7 and values of formula_3 is linear (which is certainly true when there are only two possibilities for &quot;x&quot;) this will give the same result as the square of Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient; otherwise the correlation ratio will be larger in magnitude. It can therefore be used for judging non-linear relationships.

==Range==
The correlation ratio formula_9 takes values between 0 and 1. The limit formula_10 represents the special case of no dispersion among the means of the different categories, while formula_11 refers to no dispersion within the respective categories. formula_9 is undefined when all data points of the complete population take the same value.

==Example==
Suppose there is a distribution of test scores in three topics (categories):
*Algebra: 45, 70, 29, 15 and 21 (5 scores)
*Geometry: 40, 20, 30 and 42 (4 scores)
*Statistics: 65, 95, 80, 70, 85 and 73 (6 scores).
Then the subject averages are 36, 33 and 78, with an overall average of 52. 

The sums of squares of the differences from the subject averages are 1952 for Algebra, 308 for Geometry and 600 for Statistics, adding to 2860. The overall sum of squares of the differences from the overall average is 9640. The difference of 6780 between these is also the weighted sum of the squares of the differences between the subject averages and the overall average:
:formula_13
This gives 
:formula_14
suggesting that most of the overall dispersion is a result of differences between topics, rather than within topics. Taking the square root gives
:formula_15 
For formula_16 the overall sample dispersion is purely due to dispersion among the categories and not at all due to dispersion within the individual categories. For quick comprehension simply imagine all Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics scores being the same respectively, e.g. 5 times 36, 4 times 33, 6 times 78. 

The limit formula_17 refers to the case without dispersion among the categories contributing to the overall dispersion. The trivial requirement for this extreme is that all category means are the same.

==Pearson vs. Fisher==
The correlation ratio was introduced by Karl Pearson as part of analysis of variance. Ronald Fisher commented: 
&quot;As a descriptive statistic the utility of the correlation ratio is extremely limited. It will be noticed that the number of degrees of freedom in the numerator of formula_18 depends on the number of the arrays&quot; to which Egon Pearson (Karl&#x27;s son) responded by saying 
&quot;Again, a long-established method such as the use of the correlation ratio [§45 The &quot;Correlation Ratio&quot; η] is passed over in a few words without adequate description, which is perhaps hardly fair to the student who is given no opportunity of judging its scope for himself.&quot;

<text>Edward Chad Varah (12 November 1911 – 8 November 2007) was a British Anglican priest and social activist from England. In 1953, he founded the Samaritans, the world&#x27;s first crisis hotline, to provide telephone support to those contemplating suicide.

==Life==
Varah was born in the town of Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, the eldest of nine children of the vicar at the Anglican church of St Peter. His father, Canon William Edward Varah, a strict Tractarian, named him after St Chad, who, according to Bede, had founded the 7th-century monastery &quot;ad Bearum&quot; (&quot;at Barrow&quot;), which may have occupied an Anglo-Saxon enclosure next to Barton Vicarage.

He was educated at Worksop College in north Nottinghamshire and won an exhibition to study natural sciences at Keble College, Oxford, quickly switching to Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). He was involved in the university Russian and Slavonic clubs and was founder-president of the Scandinavian Club. He graduated with a third-class degree in 1933.

==Clerical career==
Varah was initially reluctant to follow his father&#x27;s vocation, but his godfather persuaded him to study at Lincoln Theological College, where he was taught by the Revd Michael Ramsey, later Archbishop of Canterbury. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1935 and priest in 1936. He first served as curate at St Giles, Lincoln, from 1935 to 1938, then at St Mary&#x27;s, Putney, from 1938 to 1940 and Barrow-in-Furness from 1940 to 1942. He became vicar of Holy Trinity, Blackburn, in 1942 and moved to St Paul, Battersea, in 1949. He was also chaplain of St John&#x27;s Hospital, Battersea.

The Grocers&#x27; Company offered him the living of St Stephen Walbrook in 1953. He became rector of the church, designed by Christopher Wren, adjacent to the Mansion House in the City of London. The church was closed for structural repairs from 1978 to 1987. His son, Andrew, built chairs to replace its pews. Great controversy followed the installation of a large circular altar in travertine marble by Henry Moore, commissioned by Varah and his churchwarden Peter Palumbo. The matter was finally settled by the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved in 1987, which granted a retrospective faculty for its installation.

He was a supporter of female priests, but preferred the traditional 17th century Book of Common Prayer (1662) to the more modern liturgical changes authorized in 1966. Despite the absence of a permanent congregation, the church remained popular for weddings. He officiated at the marriage of Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, only daughter of Princess Margaret, to actor Daniel Chatto in 1994.

He was made an honorary prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1975, becoming senior prebendary in 1997. He retired in 2003, aged 92, by which time he was the oldest incumbent in the Church of England.

==Samaritans==
Varah began to understand the problems facing the suicidal when he was taking a funeral as an assistant curate in 1935, his first church service, for a fourteen-year-old girl who had taken her own life because she had begun to menstruate and feared that she had a sexually transmitted disease. He later said &quot;Little girl, I didn&#x27;t know you, but you have changed the rest of my life for good.&quot; He vowed at that time to encourage sex education, and to help people who were contemplating suicide and had nowhere to turn.

To that end, Chad Varah founded the Samaritans in 1953 in the crypt of his church, with the stated aim that it would be an organisation &quot;to befriend the suicidal and despairing.&quot; The phone line, MAN 9000 (for MANsion House), received its first call on 2 November 1953, and the number of calls increased substantially after publicity in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on 7 December 1953.

He was director of the central London branch of Samaritans until 1974, and president from 1974 to 1986. He was also founder chairman of Befrienders Worldwide (Samaritans International) from 1974 to 1983, and then its president from 1983 to 1986.

===Future association with Samaritans===

Later in life, Varah became disillusioned with the Samaritans organisation. He announced in 2004 that &quot;It&#x27;s no longer what I founded. I founded an organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It was no longer to be an emergency service. It was to be an emotional support for the whole bloody population whether they wanted it or not.&quot;

However, by the Summer of 2005, a rapprochement appeared to be reached when Varah met with The Samaritans&#x27; new chief executive and chairman. Varah enthusiastically listened to the new essential work of the organisation, building on the work he had started in 1953. In 2006, Varah&#x27;s eldest son, Michael Varah, was appointed to sit on the newly created board of trustees.

==Other works==
He was also closely associated with the founding of the comic &quot;The Eagle&quot; by fellow clergyman Marcus Morris in 1950. He supplemented his income by working as a scriptwriter for &quot;The Eagle&quot; and its sister publications &quot;Girl&quot;, &quot;Robin&quot; and &quot;Swift&quot; until 1961. He used his scientific education to be &quot;Scientific and Astronautical Consultant&quot; (as Varah put it) to &quot;Dan Dare&quot;. 

In line with a long-standing commitment to sex education, he was a member of the board of reference of the British edition of the adult magazine &quot;&quot;Forum&quot;&quot; from 1967 to 1987. He was patron of the Terrence Higgins Trust from 1987 to 1999 and an original patron of the Cult Information Centre.

He wrote a television play, &quot;Nobody Understands Miranda&quot;, which was broadcast by the BBC as part of &quot;The Befrienders&quot;, an eleven-episode series about the Samaritans in 1972. The episode dealt with endogenous depression.

He continued his campaigning work into his later life, founding Men Against Genital Mutilation of Girls (MAGMOG) in 1992, and publishing his autobiography, &quot;Before I Die Again&quot;, referring to his interest in reincarnation, the same year.

==Honours and awards==
Varah was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Gold Medal in 1972, and became an Honorary Fellow of Keble College in 1981. He held several honorary doctorates, and was awarded the Romanian Patriarchal Cross. 

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

He was appointed OBE in 1969, and advanced to CBE in 1995. He was created a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2000.

In 2012, three items of rolling stock in Britain were named &quot;Chad Varah&quot;:
*Direct Rail Services&#x27; 57302
*London Midland&#x27;s 350232
*Virgin Trains West Coast&#x27;s 390157

==Personal life==
Chad Varah married Susan Whanslaw in 1940 in Wandsworth, south London. They had four sons (including triplets) and a daughter. His wife became World President of the Mothers&#x27; Union in the 1970s. She died in 1993. Varah died in a hospital in Basingstoke, four days before his 96th birthday. He was survived by four of his children, his son Michael having died several months before his father.

<text>John M. Pattison (June 13, 1847 – June 18, 1906) was an American Democratic politician from Ohio. Pattison was for five months the 43rd governor of Ohio, serving for a shorter period than any other person elected to the office before his death.

==Biography==

Pattison was born near Owensville, Ohio. He joined the Union Army during the American Civil War in 1864. After the war ended, Pattison attended Ohio Wesleyan University, graduating in 1869. He graduated from Cincinnati Law School in 1872, and was admitted to the bar in 1872. Pattison briefly served in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1873 before working as an executive at an insurance company. Pattison was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1890 after briefly serving in the Ohio State Senate. He served one term from 1891 to 1893 but lost an 1892 bid for re-election. Pattison was elected governor in 1905. He entered office in January 1906 and served until his death in June.

Pattison attended his inauguration but returned home ill that day. He never again returned to the executive office. Pattison directed the government from his bed until he died at his home Promont, near Milford, Ohio. His cause of death was Bright&#x27;s disease.

He is buried in Greenlawn Cemetery in Milford, Ohio.

Pattison was married twice. He married Aletheia Williams, who died leaving three children. Another daughter had died. His second wife was Anna Williams, sister of his first wife.

Pattison was a thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason.

In 2004, Pattison Elementary School was built in Milford as John Pattison&#x27;s namesake. The school educates students in kindergarten through sixth grade. Pattison Park, located on US Highway 50 west of Owensville, is also named in his honor.

<doc id="699579" wikidata="Q4745257" url="?curid=699579" title="American Topical Association">
<text>The American Topical Association (ATA) is a US-based philatelic society and the largest organization devoted to topical stamp collecting. It was established in 1949 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by Jerome (Jerry) Husak. It currently serves members in over 60 countries. ATA publishes &quot;Topical Time&quot;, its bimonthly journal. It also publishes numerous handbooks and maintains many checklists listing hundreds of stamps by topic. The organization runs the National Topical Stamp Show as well as supporting 50+ study units on various topics and 40+ local chapters.

The American Topical Association is an affiliate of the American Philatelic Society.

==Member Services==
The ATA offers a variety of member services to Topical Collectors so they may enjoy the hobby of Topical
Stamp collecting to the fullest extent. The ATA&#x27;s office is located in Greer, South Carolina. Among the services included in annual dues payment are:

#Six bi-monthly issues of &quot;Topical Time&quot;. &quot;Topical Time&quot; is the official journal of the American Topical Association, a 92-page bi-monthly publication. The journal includes illustrated and informative topical articles, checklists and dealer advertising.

#Specific Topical Study Units. The American Topical Association is composed of members who specialize in thematic or topical philatelic collecting. Those who share a specific topic band together to form &quot;study units.&quot; These units promote their specific topic and encourage research on that topic. The topics of study cover a wide range of areas from &quot;Americana&quot; on Stamps of the world to &quot;Wine&quot; on worldwide stamps.
for a complete list of ~50 current study units.
#Handbooks. Handbooks play a vital role in making available to the topical collector research guides on various specific topics. The 
information for the handbooks have been researched and collated in some cases by members of some of the Topical Study units. This 
information is then made available in printed or digital form by the ATA.
#Checklists Service The ATA provides Checklist for hundreds of topics large and small, popular and little known areas of interest. They run from A (i.e. abacus, acrobatics, actors on stamps) to Z (zebras, zinnias, zoos on stamps). For each stamp listed the following is given:
Topic, Country, date of issue, denomination, Scott catalogue number, brief description, and non Scott number if known. Checklists supplement the ATA handbooks an particular topics. The handbook serves as a reference item while
the checklist is a spreadsheet for collectors to use when shopping at dealer booths at stamp shows or on the internet.

==Distinguished Topical Philatelist Service Award==

The Distinguished Topical Philatelist (DTP) is the highest service award offered by the ATA and is given for service to topical philately in general and to the ATA in particular.

<doc id="699582" wikidata="Q898989" url="?curid=699582" title="Bras d'Or Lake">
<text>Bras d&#x27;Or Lake (Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk: Pitupaq) is an irregular estuary in the centre of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. It has a connection to the open sea, and is tidal. It also has inflows of fresh water from rivers, making the brackish water a very productive natural habitat. It was designated the Bras d&#x27;Or Lake Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2011.

== Toponym ==
Pronounced ( or ), maps before 1872 name it &quot;Le Lac de Labrador&quot; (or more simply &quot;Labrador&quot;). &quot;Labrador&quot; was the name given by the Portuguese to much of eastern Canada. It meant &quot;farmer&quot;, and is cognate with &quot;labourer&quot;. An error of folk etymology, the name is spelt to resemble the French language &quot;Arm of&quot; &quot;Gold&quot;, a homonym. It is also called locally &quot;The Bras d&#x27;Or Lakes&quot;.

In Mi&#x27;kmawi&#x27;simk, the lake&#x27;s name, &quot;Pitupaq&quot;, refers to the brackish waters, meaning &quot;the long salt water.&quot;

== Geography ==

The lake has a surface area of 1099 square kilometers. Three arms stretch out to the north east. At the top, the Great Bras d&#x27;Or Channel connects to the ocean via a navigable channel. The maximum depth is in St. Andrews Channel. It sits in a 3,500 square kilometre drainage basin.

The western side is generally shallow, and is part of an extensive drumlin field. Steep hills rise abruptly on the northwestern side, to the Cape Breton Highlands.

The Denys, Middle, Baddeck, and Georges Rivers all empty into the lake. The lake water has lower salinity than the surrounding ocean, and varies from about 20 parts per thousand near river mouths to 29 parts per thousand in deeper areas.

Ice cover has been declining in recent years.

The lake is connected to the North Atlantic by two natural channels; the Great and Little Bras d&#x27;Or Channels which pass on either side of Boularderie Island. The southern tip of the lake is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Peters Canal, built for shipping traffic in the 1860s.

The restricted channels to the ocean cause a reduction in tidal range.

Seaweed populations resemble those found in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The warm waters are suitable for eastern oyster. Fish species include the blackspotted stickleback, white hake, blueback herring, Greenland cod, and introduced rainbow trout. These feed double-crested cormorants, bald eagles, and great blue herons.

== Human history ==

In southwestern Nova Scotia, there is archaeological evidence that traces traditional land use and resources to at least 4,000 years. Mi&#x27;kmaq peoples occupied lands around Bras d&#x27;Or Lake when European explorers first arrived. Named Unama&#x27;ki in their language, it is the fire (or capital district) of their country, Mi&#x27;kma&#x27;ki, part of the greater Wabanaki Confederacy of the Dawnland region. The Mi&#x27;kmaq call the lake &quot;Pitupaq&quot;, meaning &quot;long salt water&quot;. A French trading post was built in 1650. Alexander Graham Bell built an estate Beinn Bhreagh where he established a research laboratory, and used the lake to test man-carrying kites, airplanes and hydrofoil boats.

Most of the shore is undeveloped, but settlements include Baddeck, Eskasoni, Little Bras d&#x27;Or, St. Peter&#x27;s, and Whycocomagh. Shoreline is under the jurisdiction of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality and the county municipalities of Inverness, Victoria, and Richmond.

Sailboat racing is a long tradition in the Bras d&#x27;Or, with events hosted by the Bras d&#x27;Or Yacht Club 

Today most economic activity around the lake is related to the services in the tertiary sector of the economy.

<text>The San Diego Convention Center is the primary convention center of San Diego, California, United States. It is located in the Marina district in downtown San Diego, near the Gaslamp Quarter. The center is managed by the San Diego Convention Center Corporation, a public-benefit nonprofit corporation created by the City of San Diego.

==History==
San Diego approved a measure to fund construction of a new convention center in 1983 on land owned by the Port of San Diego. Construction of the original building began in March 1987 and was completed in November 1989. An expansion which doubled the gross square footage of the facility was completed in September 2001. In September 2008, the center took steps to acquire adjacent property for an additional expansion.

Notable events hosted at the convention center include San Diego Comic-Con, TwitchCon, and the Society for Neuroscience. Television game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; filmed live tapings of shows at the convention center, featuring contestants from the San Diego area; the episodes aired nationally in May 1997, 2003, and 2007. It hosted the 1996 Republican National Convention, which nominated Bob Dole and Jack Kemp for president and vice president of the United States, respectively. It was also the venue for the 2007 California Democratic Party Convention.

In 2008, Hilton San Diego Bayfront opened south of the convention center; this was followed by Harbor Drive Pedestrian Bridge which opened in the spring of 2011, which links the convention center with the neighborhoods on the other side of Harbor Drive. In 2014, the convention center hosted the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) International Convention, bringing in $56 million to the economy of San Diego. In 2016, the second annual convention for the video game streaming platform Twitch, TwitchCon, was hosted at the convention center. In 2019, TwitchCon was hosted again at the convention center, later revealing at the event that it would yet again be hosted at the convention center in September 2020. The event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was later hosted in October 2022. TwitchCon is set to be set at the San Diego Convention Center from 2024 to 2028, making it the second-largest recurring convention held in the venue.

===Notable events===
*San Diego Comic-Con, held annually since 1979
*Society for Neuroscience, held in 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2018, and 2022
*1996 Republican National Convention
*Biotechnology Industry Organization, held in 2014
*Esri International User Conference, held annually since 1997
*&quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, held in 1997, 2003, and 2007
*TwitchCon, held in 2016, 2019, 2022, and 2024 through 2028
*DreamHack, held in 2023

==Design==
The convention center offers of exhibit space. As of 2009, it was the 24th largest convention facility in North America. It was designed by Canadian architect Arthur Erickson. Capacity for the facility is 125,000.

The center&#x27;s most distinguishing feature is the Sails Pavilion, a exhibit and special event area. The Sails Pavilion&#x27;s roof consists of distinctive Teflon-coated fiberglass &quot;sails&quot; intended to reflect San Diego&#x27;s maritime history, as well as to advertise the center&#x27;s proximity to the San Diego shore. The Pavilion was originally built as an open-air facility under the roof. However, the center found it hard to convince potential users to book an open-air facility, so in 2000 the Pavilion area was enclosed in glass, greatly expanding the usable area of the center. Beginning in December 2016, the Sails Pavilion began a renovation period. Renovations to the Sails Pavilion were completed in late February 2018, with a capability addition of a programmable LED lighting system.

Another unusual feature of the convention center is its inclined elevator, which ascends alongside the large exterior staircase.

==Proposed expansion==
Beginning in 2008, the convention center began to pay the lease owners of the neighboring Fifth Avenue Landing property in a deal which would have bought out the lease. By November 2012, there was a $520 million proposal to expand the convention center. The proposed expansion would have increased the available space within the convention center by 33 percent and had a target completion date of early 2016. In March 2013, judicial approval was received for the funding method for the expansion; the funding would come from a special taxing district consisting of hotels in San Diego. The expansion was approved by the California Coastal Commission in October 2013.

However, on August 1, 2014, a California appeals court ruled the hotel tax unconstitutional, jeopardizing the financing scheme for the convention center expansion, forcing the city to either appeal the decision, seek ballot approval for the tax in accordance with the court&#x27;s ruling, or come up with an entirely new financing scheme. Attorney Cory Briggs was the filing attorney for the successful lawsuit; in 2015, Briggs had another lawsuit filed regarding the bay front nature of the proposed expansion. The decision was not appealed by the San Diego City Council. The effort to expand the convention center up to August 2014 expended $10 million. Due to the lawsuit, other cities have contacted Comic-Con International regarding the possibility of relocating away from San Diego. In May 2015, the Convention Center stopped paying the lease owners of the Fifth Avenue Landing, having spent $4 million up to that point, losing their rights to the property. In June 2015, the Coastal Commission again approved the convention center expansion plan. In January 2017, Briggs&#x27;s lawsuit regarding the bayfront nature of the proposed expansion was thrown out.

By 2017, plans to expand the convention center began again. However, the proposed expansion is opposed by a hotel proposal on the Fifth Avenue Landing property which was released when the previous expansion proposal ended. In 2018, a ballot initiative was launched seeking to raise funds and to gain approval for the convention center re-proposed expansion, as well as to fund services for homeless individuals; the ballot initiative will be voted on in 2020.

In November 2018, the City of San Diego paid the lease owners of the Fifth Avenue Landing, to settle a lawsuit out of court regarding development rights. While the lawsuit was occurring, the Port of San Diego and the City of San Diego were in negotiations with the Fifth Avenue Landing to enter into a new lease to allow for convention center expansion on the neighboring property, which would involve an initial $5 million payment, and a total $32 million buyout if the ballot initiative passes. In January 2019, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer stated that a deal for the Fifth Avenue Landing was still in negotiation, and the lease owners had the right to build a hotel on their leased land, which has been envisioned as where the convention center would expand.

<text>Myron Timothy Herrick (October 9, 1854March 31, 1929) was an American banker, diplomat and Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the 42nd governor of Ohio and United States Ambassador to France on two occasions.

==Biography==
Herrick was born in Huntington, Lorain County, Ohio, the son of Mary (Hulburt) Herrick and Colonel Timothy Robinson Herrick, a local farmer and businessman. He studied at Oberlin College and Ohio Wesleyan University, but graduated from neither. He married Caroline Marina Parmely of Dayton, Ohio on June 30, 1880. They had one son, Parmely Webb Herrick (1881–1937).

==Career==

Admitted to practice law in Cleveland in 1878, Herrick joined the bank Society for Savings as secretary and treasurer in 1886, and became the bank&#x27;s president in 1894.

From 1885 to 1888, Herrick was a member of the Cleveland City Council. In 1886, in Cleveland, he helped to finance the founding of The National Carbon Company, along with W. H. Lawrence, James Parmelee, and James Webb Cook Hayes, son of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes. This company, a predecessor of Union Carbide, Energizer, and Eveready, would come to figure prominently in the history of the consumer battery and the flashlight.

Herrick was a Presidential elector in 1892 for Harrison/Reid.

In 1902, Herrick gave the village of Wellington, Ohio, a grant of $20,000, which they used to build the library now known as the Herrick Memorial Library. Herrick later bequeathed $70,000 for an addition.

Herrick served as the governor of Ohio from 1904 to 1906; (future United States President) Warren G. Harding served as his lieutenant governor. He had been a protégé of political boss Mark Hanna, but in 1906 was defeated by the efforts of Wayne Wheeler and the Anti-Saloon League after he refused to support their plan for the prohibition of alcohol in Ohio.

Herrick is known for his role in contributing French-American amity in the lead-up to and during World War I. He was United States Ambassador to France from 1912 to 1914 and again from 1921 to 1929. He is the only American ambassador to France with a street named after him in Paris, in the 8th arrondissement. Herrick was the ambassador who hosted Charles Lindbergh in Paris after his successful New York-to-Paris Atlantic crossing in 1927. 

Upon his return to the United States in 1914, Herrick&#x27;s prominent role in aiding Americans stranded by the outbreak of World War I led to discussion within the Republican Party of Herrick as a possible nominee in the upcoming 1916 presidential election. Herrick himself felt his business background would prove a liability, however, and when his candidacy failed to gain traction he chose instead to mount a challenge to incumbent Democratic Senator Atlee Pomerene in 1916, which proved unsuccessful.

==Death==
Herrick was serving as United States Ambassador to France at the time of his death on March 31, 1929. He died from a heart attack.

He was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.

<doc id="699597" wikidata="Q1418976" url="?curid=699597" title="Holy Piby">
<text>The Holy Piby, also known as the Black Man&#x27;s Bible, is a text written by an Anguillan, Robert Athlyi Rogers (d. 1931), for the use of an Afrocentric religion in the West Indies founded by Rogers in the 1920s, known as the Afro-Athlican Constructive Gaathly. The theology outlined in this work saw Ethiopians (in the classical sense of all Africans) as the chosen people of God. The church preached self-reliance and self-determination for Africans, using the Piby as its guiding document.

== Content ==
The &quot;Holy Piby&quot; is made up of four books. The first, entitled &quot;The First Book of Athlyi Called Athlyi&quot;, has only two chapters. The next, &quot;The Second Book of Athlyi Called Aggregation&quot;, is the largest, with fifteen chapters, the seventh of which identifies Marcus Garvey as one of three apostles of God. The &quot;Third Book of Athlyi Named The Facts of the Apostles&quot; presents two prominent members of the UNIA-ACL, Robert Lincoln Poston and Henrietta Vinton Davis, as the other apostles in the Holy Trinity. The title of the last book is &quot;The Fourth Book of Athlyi Called Precaution&quot;. That book is followed by a series of catechism-style questions and answers wherein Garvey, Davis and Poston are proclaimed to be the saviors of the &quot;down trodden children of Ethiopia&quot;.

== History ==
=== Rastafari movement ===
Together with the &quot;Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy&quot; by Fitz Balintine Pettersburg and Leonard P. Howell&#x27;s &quot;The Promise Key&quot;, the &quot;Holy Piby&quot; is today recognized as a root document of Rastafari thought. While not strictly speaking a &quot;Rastafari text&quot;, it was certainly a primary source of influence to many in the Rastafari movement, who see Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, as the second coming of Christ. Some Rastafari see Emperor Haile Selassie I as Christ in His Kingly Character as written in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 5 and regard Marcus Mosia Garvey as a prophet.

<text>Bellinzona ( ; ; is a municipality, a historic Swiss town, and the capital of the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. The town is famous for its three castles (Castelgrande, Montebello, Sasso Corbaro) that have been UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2000.

The town lies east of the river Ticino, at the foot of the Alps. It stretches along the river valley, surrounded by the southern ranges of the Lepontine Alps to the east and west, and by the Lugano Prealps to the south.

==Name and coat of arms==
The toponym is first attested in 590 in Latin as &quot;Belitio&quot; or &quot;Bilitio&quot; (in the accusative, &quot;Bilitionem&quot;), by Gregory of Tours. The name is Lepontic in origin, possibly from &quot;belitio&quot; (&quot;juniper&quot;) or &quot;belitione&quot; (&quot;juniper bushes&quot;).

During the medieval period, the name is found as &quot;Berinzona&quot; (721, 762, 803, 1002), &quot;Birrinzona&quot; (1004), &quot;Birizona&quot; (1168), &quot;Beliciona&quot; (901, 977) and &quot;Belinzona&quot; (1055). The German name of the town is &quot;Bellenz&quot;; the Romansch is &quot;Blizuna&quot;, and in traditional French as &quot;Bellence&quot;. A local folk etymology derives the name &quot;Bellinzona&quot; from &quot;zona bellica&quot; &quot;war zone&quot;, making a connection to the Italian Wars.

The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is an erect serpent in silver on a red field. The fabulous animal is called in Italian &quot;Biscione&quot;. This animal, which can also be found on the arms of the Alfa Romeo car company, is linked with the Visconti of Milan, who were feudal lords of Bellinzona in the 14th and 15th centuries.

==History==

===Pre-History and Roman era===
Bellinzona has always occupied an important geographic location in the Alps. To the south, the Po Valley is accessible by a lowland route down the valley of the river Ticino and by Lake Maggiore. To the north, the valley of the Ticino leads to the high alpine passes of Nufenen, St. Gotthard, Lukmanier and San Bernardino. Although now little used, the San Jorio Pass to the east was also important in Bellinzona&#x27;s past.

While the region has been occupied since the early Neolithic age it wasn&#x27;t until the late 1st century BC that a fort was built in the area during the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. While the fort fell into disrepair in the following centuries, it was rebuilt and greatly expanded in the 4th century AD. During the reign of Diocletian and Constantin a chain of castles and watchtowers were built to protect northern Italy from invasion. Bellinzona&#x27;s location was recognized as a key point in the defenses and a large castle was built to protect the walls. The town that grew up around the fortifications was known as &quot;Bilitio&quot;.

Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire the successor states, which included the Ostrogoths around 500 AD, the eastern Byzantine Empire towards the middle of the 6th century, and the Longobards from 568/70, all took control of Bellinzona and used the castle to assert control of the surrounding passes. Under the Longobards, Bellinzona became the site of a permanent garrison to protect the region from raids by the neighboring Frankish and Alemannic tribes. From Bellinzona the Longobards controlled the traffic on the important trade route from Varese over Ponte Tresa, the Monte Ceneri Pass, Biasca and finally over the Lukmanier Pass into Chur. Some researchers believe that Bellinzona may have been the capital of a county that included most of the valleys in Ticino.

===Early Middle Ages===
At around 774 the Frankish Kingdom (that would become the Carolingian Empire) gained control of the Ticino valley including Bellinzona.

About two centuries later the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, seeking to restore the power of glory of ancient Rome and expand into Italy, opened the Lukmanier and St. Bernard passes. Control of Bellinzona was a key part of this expansion. The town was taken from Milan and given as a gift to the Bishop of Como, who supported the Ottonian dynasty. In 1002, following the death of Otto III, Marquis Arduino of Ivrea declared himself King of Italy and ratified the bishop&#x27;s ownership of the &quot;Castelgrande&quot; and the town. Two years later, after Arduino had been defeated by Henry II the King of Germany, Henry II&#x27;s man Enrico II reratified the gift of the &quot;Castelgrande&quot; on the Bishop of Como. The town is mentioned in medieval sources in 1218 as &quot;Bilizione&quot;.

===Conflicts between the Pope and the Emperor===
During the Investiture Controversy of the late 11th century the town of Bellinzona with its castle came under the control of the Hohenstaufens of Swabia. However, in 1180, Frederick I (Barbarossa) placed the town under the jurisdiction of the town of Como. In the following years Como tended to support the Pope in his conflicts with the Holy Roman Emperor. However, in 1239, Como sided with the Emperor Frederick II who quickly moved forces into Bellinzona and strengthened the &quot;Castelgrande&quot;. In 1242 Milan sent Guelph (or pro-papacy) forces under the command of Simone di Orello to take Bellinzona. The town and castle were taken which weakened the Emperor south of the Alps. However the town was back under the jurisdiction of Como in 1249. Conflicts in northern Italy continued, the &quot;Castelgrande&quot; was besieged several times in 1284, 1292 and 1303. During this time the Rusca family in Como, a Ghibelline or pro-Imperial family, fought the growing power of Milan under the pro-papacy House of Visconti with limited success. Around the end of the 13th century the Rusca family built another castle, &quot;Montebello&quot;, in Bellinzona, which they controlled. This was fortunate because by 1335 the Rusca family had been driven out of Como and had to retreat to Bellinzona. Five years later, in 1340, Milan besieged Bellinzona. Following a lengthy siege, the town fell to Milan but the Ruscas were allowed to keep &quot;Montebello&quot;. Pro-papacy Milan would dominate Bellinzona for the next one and a half centuries, though the pro-Imperial Rusca would also occupy part of the town.

===Expansion of Bellinzona under Milan===

Under the control of the Visconti, trade flourished and Bellinzona grew. When an alternative route over the Alps, the Schöllenen bridge opened, traffic in the St. Gotthard increased to the highest levels ever. During the second half of the 14th century a long wall, the &quot;Murata&quot;, was built across the Tessin valley, allowing Milan to protect and tax the trade route over the St. Gotthard Pass. While the town was controlled by Milan through the Visconti after 1340, the Visconti did not have a formal title and feudal rights until 1396 when they were granted by King Wenceslaus. However, the orderly growth of Bellinzona was threatened in 1402 when Duke Gian Galeazzo Visconti died. In 1403 Bellinzona came under the control of Alberto di Sacco of Val Mesolcina, who held it until 1419 before it was taken over by Uri and Obwalden, which expanded into the Leventina Valley. Milan attacked the town three years later in 1422 after an offer to buy the town was rejected by the Swiss Confederation. The troops from Uri and Obwalden were quickly driven from the town and later defeated at the Battle of Arbedo on 30 June 1422. This defeat discouraged the expansionist intentions of Uri and its allies towards Lake Maggiore for a time.

During the period of unrest following Gian Galeazzo Visconti&#x27;s death, a tower which would become the nucleus of the third castle, &quot;Sasso Corbaro&quot;, was built outside the town.

While the border between Uri and Milan was fixed in the peace treaty of 1426, in 1439 Uri invaded again. While they were unable to take Bellinzona, the victories of the Swiss troops led to Milan granting all of the Leventina Valley to Pollegio to Uri in 1441. Following the death of Duke Filippo Maria Visconti in 1447, Bellinzona was in the middle of the succession crisis between Franchino Rusca of Locarno and Heinrich of Val Mesolcina, who were allied with Uri and the Ambrosian Republic in Milan. The war following the succession crisis lasted nearly three years until Francesco I Sforza seized power in Milan. Bellinzona quickly accepted the new Sforza dynasty and the peace and stability that followed.

The peace was broken again in 1478 when the Swiss once again attacked Bellinzona unsuccessfully. However Swiss pride was restored by the Battle of Giornico which followed, where a force of 600 Swiss soldiers defeated 10,000 Milanese troops. Following the attack, Milan built the &quot;Sasso Corbaro&quot; either on the site of a tower which had been built nearly a century before. The other two castles were strengthened and the &quot;Murata&quot; wall across the valley was rebuilt. Much of the modern castles and fortifications date from this period of construction in the late 15th century.

===An associate of the Swiss Confederation===

In 1499 nearly one and a half centuries of Milanese rule ended with the invasion of Milan by Louis XII of France. He captured Bellinzona and fearing an attack by the Swiss, fortified the &quot;Castelgrande&quot; with 1000 troops. Throughout the winter of 1499/1500 unrest in Bellinzona grew, until January when an armed revolt of the citizens of Bellinzona drove the French troops from the town. Following the capture of Ludovico Sforza in April 1500 and seeking protection from France, Bellinzona joined the Swiss Confederation on 14 April 1500, as a condominium under the joint administration of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden. Following the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798, Bellinzona was the capital of the canton of Bellinzona within the Helvetic Republic (1798–1803).

===Bellinzona since 1803===
Following the Act of Mediation in 1803 Bellinzona became part of the independent canton of Ticino, and the capital of the new canton from 1803 to 1814. From that date until 1878, Bellinzona, Lugano, and Locarno, took turns being capital every six years. In 1878 Bellinzona became the capital of the canton.

The town includes the village of Artore and, since the incorporation in 1907, the former municipalities of Carasso, Daro, and Ravecchia.

In 1874, the first sections of the Gotthard railway opened, linking Bellinzona to Biasca and Locarno. By 1882, the whole line was open, extending northwards to northern Switzerland via the Gotthard Tunnel, southwards to Lugano and Milan via the Monte Ceneri Pass, and down the east shore of Lake Maggiore to Luino. Between 1907 and 1972, Bellinzona was also linked to Mesocco and other Val Mesolcina communities by the Bellinzona–Mesocco railway.

==Geography==


On 2 April 2017 the former neighbouring municipalities of Camorino, Claro, Giubiasco, Gnosca, Gorduno, Gudo, Moleno, Monte Carasso, Pianezzo, Preonzo, Sant&#x27;Antonio and Sementina merged into Bellinzona.

The town is located at a point at which the river Ticino, which has been flowing in a generally southerly direction, makes a turn to the west, to flow through the wide Pionoa di Magadino before entering the Lake Maggiore, and after it finally reaches to the Italian Po Valley and Lombardy.

Upstream, several valleys reach into the high Alps, with access to northern Switzerland over or through the Passo del San Gottardo via the Valle Leventina, the upper valley of the Ticino, and further to the west with access to the Valais over the Nufenen Pass via the Val Bedretto, and access to the Grisonian Surselva of the Anterior Rhine via the Valle di Blenio over the Lukmanier Pass. The river Moesa, running down the Valle Mesolcina from the San Bernardino Pass with access to the Gresionian valley &quot;Rheinwald&quot; of the Posterior Rhine, joins the Ticino on the northern boundary of the town.

To the south the Monte Ceneri Pass crosses the Lugano Prealps to give access to Lake Lugano and an alternate route to Lombardy, whilst the San Jorio Pass provides a possible route east to the upper Lake Como.

==The Three Castles==



The Three Castles, officially listed as the Three Castles, Defensive Wall and Ramparts of the Market-Town of Bellinzona, have been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. The group is composed of &quot;Castelgrande&quot;, castle &quot;Montebello&quot;, castle &quot;Sasso Corbaro&quot; and fortified walls. The &quot;Castelgrande&quot; is located on a rocky peak overlooking the valley, with a series of fortified walls that protect the old town and connect to the &quot;Montebello&quot;. The third castle (&quot;Sasso Corbaro&quot;) is located on an isolated rocky promontory south-east of the other two.

===Castelgrande===
The site of the &quot;Castelgrande&quot; has been fortified since at least the late 1st century BC and until the 13th century, it was the only fortification in Bellinzona. During its history the castle has been known as the stronghold (before the 13th century), the Old Castle in the 14th and 15th centuries, &quot;Uri Castle&quot; after 1506 and Saint Michael&#x27;s Castle from 1818.

The &quot;Castelgrande&quot; hill includes a nearly vertical side on the north and a steep southern side, but is nearly flat and in diameter. The natural shape of the hill has encouraged every man-made fortification to follow the same contours. While the Roman fort is not visible the Roman foundations were used by the High Middle Ages castle which followed. Of the High Middle Ages castle the only visible parts are a few pieces of wall that are still standing. Much of the visible castle dates from 1250 to 1500 with extensive renovations and some expansion in the last two centuries. Most of the area inside the castle walls is now flat, open space.

Records from the 11th to 15th centuries as well as archeological evidence indicate that the castle grounds were once full of buildings. However, most of these were pulled down by the Dukes of Milan to free up interior space. The open space was divided into 3 large baileys which served to provide temporary housing for troops that could be stationed in Bellinzona. Under the Dukes of Milan, the outer fortifications were extended and strengthened. The walls were raised and extended and towers were added. The western walls were totally rebuilt and connected to the town walls.

The castle can be reached by taking an elevator from the foot of the rock to the castle grounds or by climbing steep, narrow streets from the town centre through the town wall onto the castle grounds.

===Montebello===
Montebello Castle (known as the Small, New or Middle Castle in the 15th century, as Schwyz Castle from 1506 and St. Martin&#x27;s Castle after 1818) is located to the east of the town centre. It was built before 1313 for the pro-Imperial Rusca family, who occupied the castle following the Visconti victory and occupation of the &quot;Castelgrande&quot;. By the end of the 14th century it was in the hands of the Visconti. The castle was renovated and expanded between 1462 and 1490 to its current state. In the 19th century, the castle fell into disrepair and was renovated starting in 1903.

A little chapel, dedicated to Saint Michael, leans against the wall of the more recent south-facing section; built around 1600, it is one of the few buildings erected in the castles of Bellinzona under the rule of the three Swiss cantons.

Montebello Castle houses the Archaeological and Civic Museum. The museum was opened in 1974 and is located in the tower and the former residential quarters of Montebello Castle. It is divided into two sections-history and archaeology. In the history section, there are several capitals from the 15th century and a rare 13th-century Baptismal font as well as drawings and sketches from several artists. This section also houses a collection of ceremonial and military arms. The archaeology section includes many items from 1400 to 1500 BC as well as ceramics, glassware, funeral urns, ornamental objects and jewellery in iron and bronze from around the canton. The museum is open from March to November.

===Sasso Corbaro===
Sasso Corbaro, known as Unterwalden Castle after 1506 and Saint Barbara&#x27;s Castle after 1818, is about south-west of town on a rocky hill. Unlike the other two castles Sasso Corbaro is not integrated into the town walls. The first part of the castle was the north-eastern tower which was built in 1478 to close a gap in the defenses of the town. The walls and south-west tower were added later. The castle was struck by lightning multiple times during the 16th and 17th centuries, and by 1900 was falling into ruins.

Today, Sasso Corbaro Castle houses the &quot;Sala Emma Poglia&quot; which is the &quot;wooden room&quot; built for the Emma family during the 17th century. Originally located in the entrance hall of their home in Olivone in the Blenio Valley, the room was purchased by the canton of Ticino in 1944 and housed first in the &quot;Castelgrande&quot; before being moved to the Sasso Corbaro in 1989. The room is panelled entirely in walnut and also includes the &quot;stüva&quot;, stove which provided heating. The stove bears the crest of the Emma family (an eagle and a lion rampant). The museum also houses temporary exhibits. It is open from March until November.

<text>George Kilbon Nash (August 14, 1842October 28, 1904) was an American attorney and Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the 41st governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
Nash was born in York Township, Medina County, Ohio. He attended the preparatory school at Western Reserve College. At 20 years of age he entered Oberlin College and stayed until his sophomore year, when he enlisted as a private in the One hundred fiftieth regiment of the Ohio National Guard of the Union Army during the Civil War. After the war he studied law in the offices of Robert B. Warden, who had been a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. He was admitted to the bar in 1867 in Columbus, Ohio. He was elected prosecuting attorney of Franklin County, Ohio, in 1870, and re-elected in 1872. He re-entered private practice, and in 1876 lost a bid for Congress, and lost for Ohio Attorney General in 1877. In October, 1879, he was elected Ohio Attorney General. In 1881 he was re-elected. In 1883, he was appointed a member of the Supreme Court Commission of Ohio for two years. He then devoted time to lucrative private practice, including significant railroad litigation, and party politics. Nash served as Governor of Ohio from January 8, 1900, to January 11, 1904.

==Story with Dick Price==
The following story is written in the book by Al Jennings, &quot;Through the Shadows With O. Henry&quot;.
A young inmate, Dick Price, was sentenced for life for repeated safe-cracking, in which he was a good specialist. Once there was a necessity to open a safe of a company, when keys were lost. George Nash promised to pardon Price, if he did it. Price cracked the safe, but Nash didn&#x27;t pardon him, failing to fulfil his promise. Soon Price died in prison. His story was used by O. Henry in his story &quot;A Retrieved Reformation&quot;.

According to other sources, the name of the safe-cracker was Jimmy Connors.

==Family==
George K. Nash was the son of Asa Nash and Electa Branch Nash. They were farmers in Medina County, originally from Massachusetts. There were three sons and two daughters in the family. Nash married Mrs. William K. Deshler, (Adaline Ayres), April, 1882. She died October 17, 1886. They had one daughter, named Mary Nash, who died February 12, 1897. Both were interred in Green Lawn Cemetery, and Nash visited their graves and left flowers before each of his inaugurations. Governor Nash was also buried at Green Lawn.

<text>Escape from L.A. (stylized on-screen as John Carpenter&#x27;s Escape from L.A.) is a 1996 American post-apocalyptic action film co-written, co-scored, and directed by John Carpenter, co-written and produced by Debra Hill and Kurt Russell, with Russell also starring as Snake Plissken. A sequel to &quot;Escape from New York&quot; (1981), &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; co-stars Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach, Bruce Campbell, Peter Fonda, and Pam Grier. &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; failed to meet the studio&#x27;s expectations at the box office and received polarized reactions from critics. The film later found a strong cult following.

==Plot==
In 2000, a massive earthquake strikes the city of Los Angeles, cutting it off from the mainland as the San Fernando Valley floods. Declaring that God is punishing Los Angeles for its sins, a theocratic presidential candidate wins election to a lifetime term of office. He orders the United States capital relocated from Washington, D.C. to his hometown of Lynchburg, Virginia and enacts a series of strict morality laws, banning such things as smoking, alcohol, drugs, premarital sex, firearms, profanity, and red meat. Violators are given a choice between loss of U.S. citizenship and permanent deportation to the new Los Angeles Island, or repentance and death by electrocution. Escape from the island is made impossible due to a containment wall erected along the mainland shore and a heavy federal police presence monitoring the area.

By 2013, the U.S. has developed a superweapon known as the &quot;Sword of Damocles,&quot; a satellite system capable of targeting electronic devices anywhere in the world and rendering them useless. The president intends to use it to dominate the world by destroying hostile nations&#x27; ability to function. His daughter Utopia steals the remote control for the system and escapes to Los Angeles Island in order to deliver it to Cuervo Jones, a Peruvian Shining Path revolutionary. Cuervo has marshaled an invasion force of third world nations and is planning to attack the U.S.

Facing deportation for a series of crimes, Snake Plissken is offered a chance to earn a pardon by traveling to the island and recovering the remote, a task that a previous rescue team failed to accomplish. To force his compliance, the president has one of his officers infect Snake with a virus that will kill him within ten hours and promises that he will receive the cure upon completing the mission. The president is not concerned with Utopia&#x27;s safety, regarding her as a traitor.

Snake is issued equipment and sent to Los Angeles in a one-man submarine. As he explores the island, he meets &quot;Map to the Stars&quot; Eddie, a swindler who sells interactive tours and one of Cuervo&#x27;s associates. Along the way, Snake is helped by Pipeline, a surfing enthusiast; Taslima, a woman deported for her Muslim faith; and Hershe Las Palmas (formerly Carjack Malone), a trans woman and past criminal associate of Snake&#x27;s.

Eddie captures Snake and turns him over to Cuervo, who uses the Sword of Damocles to shut down Lynchburg in retaliation for Snake&#x27;s presence. Cuervo threatens to inflict the same fate on the rest of the U.S. unless his demands are met. Snake escapes, and teams up with Hershe and her soldiers. The group travels by glider to the invasion staging area, at the &quot;Happy Kingdom&quot; in Anaheim. During a fight against Cuervo&#x27;s troops, Snake takes the remote and Eddie alters one of the units he sells for his tours to match it. Snake, Eddie, Utopia, Hershe, and a group of Hershe&#x27;s soldiers escape the island in a helicopter. Eddie shoots Cuervo, who fires a rocket launcher and hits the helicopter before dying. Hershe and her men are incinerated, Eddie jumps clear at liftoff, and Snake and Utopia do the same over the mainland and leave the helicopter to crash once Snake alerts the president to their approach.

At the crash site, the president and his officers find that both Snake and Utopia are carrying remotes and take the one held by Utopia (slipped into her pocket without her noticing), thinking that Snake has switched them. As Utopia is taken to the electric chair, Snake learns that the virus infecting him only causes a severe case of influenza that subsides within hours. The president tries to use Utopia&#x27;s remote to neutralize an invasion force threatening Florida, but it only plays a recorded introduction to one of Eddie&#x27;s tours.

Furious, the president orders his officers to kill Snake on the spot, but he proves to be only a hologram projected from a miniature camera that had been issued to him. Disgusted at the world&#x27;s never-ending class warfare, he programs the real remote and triggers every satellite in the Sword of Damocles system, deactivating all technology on Earth and saving Utopia from electrocution as the power fails. Snake tosses the now-useless camera aside and lights a cigarette, then blows out the match and mutters, &quot;Welcome to the human race.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; was in development for over 10 years. In 1987, screenwriter Coleman Luck was commissioned to write a screenplay for the film with Dino De Laurentiis&#x27;s company producing, which John Carpenter later described as being &quot;too light, too campy&quot;. Carpenter stated one of the reasons it took so long to develop a sequel was because of his negative views on sequels, especially in regards to the ones that followed on from &quot;Halloween&quot;.

Eventually, Carpenter and Kurt Russell got together to write with their long-time collaborator Debra Hill with Russell instigating the process as he took inspiration from contemporary events in Los Angeles such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Carpenter insists that Russell&#x27;s persistence allowed the film to be made, since &quot;Snake Plissken was a character he loved and wanted to play again.&quot; Carpenter credited that same enthusiasm with motivating Russell&#x27;s work on the script, declaring &quot;I used his passion to do the movie to get him to write more&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Carpenter has described &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; as both &quot;fun to make&quot; and requiring &quot;months of nights&quot; of work. Carpenter would later recall that the theme park scene, shot at night on a Universal backlot, resulted in a noise complaint from Rick Dees which forced them to cease using live ammunition. CG supervisor David Jones has expressed his distaste for the resulting effects used in the battle, which he described as &quot;a little iffy&quot;. Although uncredited, Tony Hawk has claimed that he and fellow professional skateboarder Chris Miller worked as stunt doubles for Peter Fonda and Kurt Russell during the surfing scene. Several scenes were shot in Carson, including the Sunset Boulevard and freeway sequences. The Sunset Boulevard scene was filmed in a landfill, where production staff constructed over 120 structures to create a shanty town. To create the impression of a crowded post-apocalyptic freeway, 250 broken cars were sourced from a junkyard in Ventura.

Escape from L.A. was initially released on DVD in the United States on December 15, 1998, and later reissued on September 26, 2017.

The film was released on Blu-ray by Paramount on May 4, 2010. In 2020, Shout! Factory released a new 4K restoration on Blu-ray. In 2022, the 4K restoration was released on 4K Blu-ray. Upon its release, an English audio encoding error was noted by several reviewers, prompting Paramount to correct the issue in unreleased discs and launch a replacement program for initial purchasers.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; grossed $25,477,365 in the United States and Canada from its $50 million budget, about as much as its predecessor but little more than half its significantly higher budget. Internationally it grossed $16.8 million for a worldwide total of $42.3 million.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews and has a 53% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 57 reviews, with an average score of 5.6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; has its moments, although it certainly suffers in comparison to the cult classic that preceded it&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of a possible four and wrote that the movie felt it was an attempt to satirize the genre while exploiting it: &quot;[&quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;] has such manic energy, such a weird, cockeyed vision, that it may work on some moviegoers as satire and on others as the real thing.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;A cartoonish, cheesy, and surprisingly campy apocalyptic actioner, &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Escape From L.A.&quot; is spiked with a number of funny and anarchic ideas, but doesn&#x27;t begin to pull them together into a coherent whole.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated it C+ and wrote, &quot;Carpenter never was the filmmaker his cult claimed him to be, but in &quot;Escape From L.A.&quot;, he at least has the instinct to keep his hero moving, like some leather-biker Candide.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s in-jokes &quot;go a long way toward keeping afloat a hopelessly choppy adventure spoof that doesn&#x27;t even to try to match the ghoulish surrealism of its forerunner.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;With much humor and high adventure, &quot;John Carpenter&#x27;s Escape From L.A.&quot; brilliantly imagines a Dante-esque vision of the City of Angels.&quot; Peter Stack of &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; rated it 3/4 stars and called it &quot;dark, percussive and perversely fun.&quot; Esther Iverem of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;tries but fails to be an action-hero flick or even a parody of one.&quot; Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, &quot;Loud, rollicking, alternately ultraviolent and hilarious, &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; is Snake redux, and what more do you need, really?&quot; Nigel Floyd of &quot;Time Out London&quot; wrote, &quot;After 15 years of computer-generated effects, apocalyptic sci-fi and Arnie movies with flippant kiss-off lines, the sequel feels hackneyed and pointless.&quot; Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, &quot;Apart from a few good characters, this is really not up to scratch in most departments especially the ludicrous plot.&quot;

In a 2013 retrospective, Alan Zilberman of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; called Snake Plissken &quot;a pro-nostalgia antihero, disgusted by the world around him.&quot; While contrasting the film&#x27;s then-futuristic plot elements against modern-day reality, Zilberman writes that the film&#x27;s ending is more profound today, as Plissken would be annoyed by our fascination with technology, citing the example of two friends who ignore each other while transfixed with their smart phones.

===John Carpenter’s thoughts on the film===
John Carpenter has always held &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; in high regard, often asserting that it is &quot;ten times better&quot; than the original &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. He credits the film’s darker, more nihilistic tone and deeper themes, but acknowledges that audiences misinterpreted it as a remake rather than a sequel, which led to its mixed reception. &quot;People didn’t like it because they felt it was a remake, not a sequel.&quot; Despite this, Carpenter has never regretted his work on the film and continues to enjoy it, particularly the hang gliding and Peter Fonda&#x27;s performance as Pipeline. &quot;I really dig &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, and I always have.&quot; He remains content with the film’s legacy, despite its initial lukewarm response, and is unbothered by its commercial performance, stating, &quot;Whatever it does, it does.&quot; 

==Other media==
===&quot;Escape from Earth&quot;===
A sequel of the movie, titled &quot;Escape from Earth&quot;, was meant to be produced after &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; but the underperformance of the latter changed the plans. According to John Carpenter, &quot;Escape from Earth&quot; would have picked up with Snake Plissken right after the ending of &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;, which saw him activating a superweapon known as the Sword of Damocles: &quot;Escape from Earth was kind of Snake Plissken in a space capsule, flying interstellar. So there&#x27;d be a lot of special effects in it. Which I never care about too much. But that&#x27;s what it would look like.&quot;

===Comic books===
Marvel Comics released the one-shot &quot;The Adventures of Snake Plissken&quot; in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between &quot;Escape from New York&quot; and his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;. Snake has robbed Atlanta&#x27;s Centers for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that&#x27;s really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program in order to predict and anticipate a specific criminal&#x27;s every move. The robot&#x27;s first test subject is Snake. After a brief battle, ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Snake punches the machine and destroys it, reasoning, &quot;I don&#x27;t need the competition.&quot;

===Cancelled video game===
An &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; video game was announced for the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, Panasonic M2, and PC in 1996, but was later cancelled.

<doc id="699613" wikidata="Q720157" url="?curid=699613" title="Asa S. Bushnell">
<text>Asa Smith Bushnell I (September 16, 1834 – January 15, 1904) was an American Republican politician from Ohio. He served as the 40th governor of Ohio. Before becoming governor, he served as the president of the Warder, Bushnell and Glessner Company, one of four companies that would merge to form International Harvester. Other roles in business included serving as president of the Springfield Gas Company and the First National Bank of Springfield.

==Biography==
Bushnell was born in Rome, New York, and moved to Springfield, Ohio, at age 17. During the American Civil War, he raised a company of men for the 152nd Ohio Infantry, a 100-days regiment, and served as captain from May to September 1864. He was a Presidential elector in 1884 for Blaine/Logan. A business executive, Bushnell served as the Ohio state Republican Party Chair in 1885. He succeeded William McKinley as governor, serving two two-year terms from 1896 to 1900.

===Valentine Anti-Trust Act===
During the Bushnell administration, Ohio took an early leadership role in trust-busting. The Valentine Anti-Trust Act was signed into law by Bushnell. This Act prohibited price fixing, and production limitation. All of these practices helped businesses by driving up the prices for their products, thus harming the consumer. In addition to Valentine Anti-Trust Act, Bushnell&#x27;s attorney general pursued the monopolistic practices of the Standard Oil Company in the courts. Eventually, U.S. Senator John Sherman of Ohio introduced the Sherman Antitrust Act in the United States Congress in 1890. This law served as the first serious attempt by the federal government to break up monopolies and trusts, though successful enforcement of anti-trust laws was still more than a decade, and new political commitment, away.

===Death===
Bushnell came from his home at Springfield in January 1904 to attend the inauguration of Governor Myron T. Herrick at Columbus. After the ceremony, he entered his carriage to return home, was struck with apoplexy before reaching the railroad station, and died at a Columbus hospital four days later. He was buried in the Ferncliff Cemetery, Springfield on January 18, 1904.

==Family==
Bushnell married Ellen Ludlow of Springfield, September 17, 1857. They had two daughters and a son. He was a member of the Masons, the Grand Army of the Republic, and the Episcopal Church

==Residence==
Bushnell and his wife built a Richardson Romanesque mansion in Springfield, Ohio. The house was not designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, but by Richardson’s firm soon after the architect&#x27;s death. Both of Bushnell&#x27;s business partners, Benjamin Head Warder and John Glessner, had earlier hired Richardson to design their houses: the Warder Mansion in Washington, DC, and the John J. Glessner House in Chicago. Glessner&#x27;s house is considered one of Richardson&#x27;s greatest designs.

The Bushnell House is part of Springfield&#x27;s East High Street Historic District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Bristol Airport , at Lulsgate Bottom, on the northern slopes of the Mendip Hills, in North Somerset, is an international airport serving the city of Bristol, England, and the surrounding area. It is southwest of Bristol city centre. Built on the site of a former RAF airfield, it opened in 1957 as Bristol (Lulsgate) Airport, replacing Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport as Bristol&#x27;s municipal airport. From 1997 to 2010, it was known as Bristol International Airport. In 1997, a majority shareholding in the airport was sold to FirstGroup, and then in 2001 the airport was sold to a joint venture of Macquarie Bank and others. In September 2014, Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan bought out Macquarie to become the sole owner.

In 2019, it was ranked the eighth busiest airport (overtaking Glasgow Airport from the previous year) in the United Kingdom, handling over 8.9 million passengers, a 3% increase compared with 2018. A passenger survey carried out in 2015 found that 32.5% of journeys using the airport started or ended in the city of Bristol, 9.6% in Gloucestershire, 24.5% in Somerset, 16.9% in Devon and 8.2% in Wiltshire.

Airlines with operating bases at the airport include EasyJet and Ryanair. The airport has a Civil Aviation Authority Public Use Aerodrome Licence (number P432) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers and for flying instruction.

In 1927, a group of local businessmen raised £6,000 through public subscription to start the Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club, a flying club initially based at Filton Aerodrome. In 1929, Bristol Corporation took up the club&#x27;s proposal to develop farmland located at Whitchurch, to the south of Bristol, into a municipal airport. On its opening by Prince George, Duke of Kent in 1930, Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport was the third civil airport in the United Kingdom. Passenger numbers grew to 4,000 by 1939.

During World War II, Whitchurch was the main civil airport remaining operational. The newly formed British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was transferred to Whitchurch from Croydon Airport and Heston Airport. BOAC operated routes around the British Empire and to neutral nations. The Bristol–Lisbon route (Portugal was a neutral nation and had both British and German planes flying there) was operated by the Dutch airline KLM, under charter to BOAC. Winston Churchill even flew from Bristol.

===RAF Lulsgate Bottom===
In September 1940, No. 10 Elementary Flying Training School RAF at RAF Weston-super-Mare established a Relief Landing Ground on at Broadfield Down by the hamlet of Lulsgate Bottom, southwest of the city and north of Redhill village. Being high, at , the site had a poor weather record during warm front conditions, when it was often covered in low cloud. However, when this occurred the alternative airfields at Filton and Cardiff were usually clear and operational; and as Lulsgate was clear when the low-lying airfields were obscured by radiation fog in calm weather, the landing ground provided a useful alternative. Few facilities were constructed although pillboxes, defensive anti-aircraft guns and later two Blister hangars were added. In late 1940, a Starfish site was set up south of the village of Downside and just west of the airfield. Its decoy fires attracted a large quantity of Luftwaffe high explosives and incendiaries on the nights of 16 March, 3 April and 4 April 1941 during the Bristol Blitz.

In 1941, RAF Fighter Command planned to use the airfield for an experimental unit, and after requisitioning land from several adjacent farms, contracted George Wimpey and Company to begin work on 11 June 1941. However, its intended use soon changed into being a satellite airfield for the fighter squadrons based at RAF Colerne. Originally, the new airfield&#x27;s name was to be RAF Broadfield Down. The airfield used a standard-issue three-runway layout resembling an A shape. The main, east–west runway was long, with a designated alignment of 28/10, and the others were aligned 21/03 and aligned 34/16. The first aircraft to land was a Luftwaffe Ju 88 at 06.20 on 24 July 1941. Returning from a raid, its crew had been deceived by the RAF electronic countermeasures radio beacon at Lympsham, which was re-radiating the signal from a Luftwaffe homing beacon at Brest, France.

By 1942, there was no longer a need for an additional fighter airfield. With its name changed to RAF Lulsgate Bottom, the airfield was declared operational on 15 January 1942. The Miles Masters, Airspeed Oxfords and Hawker Hurricanes of No. 286 (AA Cooperation) Squadron became resident, with the role of providing realistic exercises for ground anti-aircraft defences. However, as the site lacked some basic facilities, No. 286 moved to RAF Zeals in May. From 1 June 1942, the airfield was under No. 23 Group of RAF Flying Training Command, and initially became a satellite airfield for No. 3 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit (3 (P)AFU), based at RAF South Cerney, flying Oxfords. In March 1943, No. 1540 Beam Approach Training Flight RAF (1540 BATF) was formed at Lulsgate, again flying Oxfords. On 27 September 1943, 3 (P)AFU left Lulsgate for RAF Southrop, and was replaced on 1 October 1943 by No. 3 Flying Instructors School (3 FIS), which was previously headquartered at RAF Hullavington. 3 FIS flew mostly Oxfords and some Masters.

In 1944, BOAC started to use the airfield for Douglas Dakota and Consolidated Liberator crew training, and BOAC flights made use of it occasionally as an alternate airfield for Whitchurch, and for topping-up fuel on the Bristol–Lisbon route.

On 6 February 1945, 1540 BATF left for RAF Weston Zoyland. On 18 July 1945, 3 FIS was absorbed into 7 FIS. With the war over, the RAF ceased training at Lulsgate on 15 April 1946, and the next month 7 FIS left the airfield and joined the Central Flying School at RAF Little Rissington. The RAF finally abandoned Lulsgate on 25 October 1946.

===Lulsgate Bottom Airfield===
From 1948, the site was the home of the Bristol Gliding Club. In 1949 and 1950, the Bristol Motor Cycle and Light Car Club hosted motor races on a circuit known as Lulsgate Aerodrome, but due to planning and noise issues moved in 1950 to a site that became known as Castle Combe Circuit.

===Bristol (Lulsgate) Airport===
Whitchurch airport continued to be used after World War II, but the introduction of heavier post-war airliners made a runway extension highly desirable. However, this was difficult at Whitchurch, because of the nearby housing estates. In June 1955, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation agreed to sell the Lulsgate airfield to Bristol Corporation, for the development of a new airport there. Bristol Gliding Club moved out to Nympsfield in Gloucestershire.

In addition to the purchase price of £55,000, the city spent a further £200,000 by 1958 on building the terminal and other development. In mid-April 1957, all air traffic was transferred from Whitchurch to the new airport. With the name of Bristol (Lulsgate) Airport, it was officially opened on 1 May 1957 by Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. In the airport&#x27;s first year it was used by 33,000 people. Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club also moved to Lulsgate.

In 1962, a new control tower was built, and in 1969 the runway was lengthened and extensions were made to the terminal. In 1968 a new cargo transit shed was constructed. In 1974, the airline Court Line collapsed, causing a fall in passenger numbers.

By 1980, although 17 charter airlines were operating from the airport, it was making a loss. Les Wilson took over as managing director in that year, a position which he held until his death in a car crash in November 1995; much of the airport&#x27;s subsequent strong recovery over that period has been attributed to him. The airport moved back into profit in financial year 1981/82, and by 1983/84 the profit was £0.5million. In 1984, an international departure lounge was added, with duty-free shops and a 24-hour air-side bar.

The Airports Act 1986 required every municipal airport with a turnover greater than £1 million to be turned into a public limited company. On 1 April 1987, Bristol City Council transferred the operation and net assets of the airport to Bristol Airport plc. The council retained full ownership of the company. However, under the terms of the Act, as long as the local authority retained a majority shareholding there were restrictions on the ability of the company to raise finance for capital projects.

In 1988, the airport opened a new concourse area. In 1994, a planning application for a new terminal was approved. With other projects also planned, the council decided to sell a majority shareholding in the airport, so that the restrictions imposed by the Airports Act on raising the necessary finance could be removed.

===Bristol International Airport===


In mid-1997, the airport&#x27;s name was changed to Bristol International Airport. In November 1997, the successful bidder for the purchase of a 51% stake in the airport company was revealed to be FirstBus. The remaining 49% was retained by the council. Work on the new terminal building had already started; it opened in March 2000, at a cost of £27 million. In 2000, passenger numbers exceeded two million for the first time. A new control tower was built and the A38 road was diverted to cater for the installation of a Category 3 instrument landing system; these projects were completed in 2001.

In January 2001, the airport was purchased for £198&amp; million, by a joint venture of Macquarie Bank and Cintra, part of the Ferrovial group. Ferrovial sold its 50% share to Macquarie in 2006. The Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan made two substantial share purchases, in 2002 and 2009.

In May 2001, the low-cost carrier Go Fly made Bristol Airport its second base after Stansted. Passenger numbers passed through three million in 2002, largely due to Go&#x27;s arrival. EasyJet purchased Go in 2002, took over the base in 2003 and continued its rapid growth in destinations. In May 2005, Continental Airlines introduced a direct flight from Bristol to Newark with Boeing 757 aircraft, though this ceased in November 2010.

A new asphalt runway surface was laid between November 2006 and March 2007, at a cost of £17 million. Within this period, on 29 December and 3 January, there were four incidents of reduced braking action in wet conditions on the temporary surface, including two in which aircraft left the runway. From 5 January, ten airlines, led by EasyJet, cancelled or diverted their Bristol flights. The airport closed the runway on 7 January to cut grooves into the surface to improve water runoff, and flights resumed the next day.

Ryanair established a base at the airport in 2007. In 2008, passenger numbers reached six million.

===Bristol Airport===
In March 2010, the airport was rebranded as Bristol Airport. The airport gained a new logo, said by the airport&#x27;s owners to represent &#x27;people&#x27;, &#x27;place&#x27; and &#x27;region&#x27;; and a new slogan, &quot;Amazing journeys start here&quot;.

Bristol Airport does not operate any jetways, so aircraft have to park on the apron and passengers either walk out to their flights or are carried by bus. May 2010 saw the opening of a walkway to the west of the terminal building, connecting it to eight new pre-boarding zones, at a cost of £8 million, to reduce the need for buses. In 2012, BMI Regional established a base at the airport. In 2013, the airline added routes to German and Italian hub airports, aimed at business travellers.

In September 2014, Toronto-based Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan agreed to buy Macquarie&#x27;s remaining 50% stake in the airport, thereby gaining 100% ownership. In July 2020, over 76 employee redundancies, up to a quarter of the work force, were announced by Bristol Airport. The job losses were announced despite the government&#x27;s Job Retention Scheme.
On 11 November 2020, Jet2.com and Jet2holidays announced that they would open their tenth UK base at Bristol Airport on 1 April 2021, operating to 33 destinations; however, as a result of the ongoing coronavirus travel restrictions, the base opening and flights were delayed until 1 July 2021. In May 2023, it was announced that TUI Airways would discontinue their long-haul routes to Melbourne, Florida, and Cancún, Mexico. The two routes ceased at the end of summer 2023, this left the airport with no transatlantic routes.

==Expansion==
===Initial Development Plans=== 
In response to the UK government&#x27;s 2003 white paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, the airport published a Master Plan for expansion over the period 2006–2030.

In October 2007, the airport announced that it would delay the planning application until the middle of 2008 to give it time to complete research on the airport&#x27;s effect on the environment. The World Development Movement claimed that flights from the airport generated the same amount of carbon dioxide as the nation of Malawi.

A campaign against the plan was led by Stop Bristol Airport Expansion, supported by Bristol Friends of the Earth and the Campaign to Protect Rural England.

====Approval and Staging====
The application was eventually submitted in 2009. The £150M plan, designed to facilitate growth in annual passenger numbers to 10 million, was approved by North Somerset Council in 2010 and by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government later the same year.

In October 2011, Stop Bristol Airport Expansion lost its legal challenge to the plan.

The expansion was to occur in stages, spread over 30 construction projects. Plans included a doubling of passenger terminal floorspace, new piers and aircraft parking stands, extensions to the apron, multi-storey car parking and a public transport interchange.

====Construction==== 
The first project was completed in June 2012, with the opening of three new aircraft stands.

In July 2014, a , £6.5M walkway connected to the centre of the terminal was opened, providing four more pre-boarding zones including ones for wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

In July 2015, the airport opened an £8.6M eastward extension of the terminal, with a larger departure lounge and an outdoor terrace. Construction of another terminal extension started immediately, to the west and costing £24M. The first phases of the western extension, which opened in summer 2016, provided a new security search area for departures, with 12 security lanes including a fast track zone. New arrivals facilities within the extension, including baggage reclaim and customs, were scheduled to open later in 2016. In October 2016, the airport announced that a further project, an enlargement of the immigration hall, will complete in 2017. These were completed and opened to the public in April 2017, enabling an increase in the number of passport control points from 10 to 17, of which 10 are ePassport gates.

Work on a £9.5M multi-storey car park began in November 2017, following a £2.5M upgrade to the customer reception centre in the silver zone car park. The new car park opened in May 2018.

===Hotel===
A planning application for an on-site 251-room hotel was approved separately in 2010. In February 2014, a planning application was submitted for a revision to the previously approved design, with a 201-room hotel to be built initially, followed later by a 50-room addition. The airport stated that among the UK&#x27;s busiest 16 airports, only Bristol lacked an on-site hotel. In February 2015, the airport announced that the 201-room hotel would be completed in 2016, and will be operated as a Hampton by Hilton. It opened for bookings in January 2017. It was funded, built and is owned, by a Chinese company, CIMC Modular Building Systems, who shipped prefabricated modules for its construction from China.

===2018 expansion proposal===
In 2018 the airport applied to extend the airport to allow a growth in passenger numbers to 12 million. The plan involved enlarging the passenger terminus and plane taxiways. It also planned to add parking for 3,000 more cars, much of it on greenbelt land. There was much resistance to the plan with 84% of North Somerset residents who commented rejecting the expansion plan. Bristol Airport Action Network (BAAN), a network of organisations including Extinction Rebellion, North Somerset Parishes, Stop Airport Expansion, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace organised a huge resistance. This culminated in North Somerset council voting 18 to 7 to reject the plan on 10 February 2020. It said the detrimental effect on the area and the wider impact on the environment outweighed the narrower benefits to airport expansion.

====Appeal====
The airport appealed, and a four-week public inquiry started in July 2021. The Planning Inspectorate granted the appeal in February 2022. Bristol Airport Action Network applied for a statutory appeal, which was held in the High Court in Bristol in November 2022.

In January 2023 the appeal in the High Court was dismissed. Sarah Warren, a cabinet member of Bath and North East Somerset Council, said it was a &quot;deeply disappointing result&quot;. In May 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed an application to hear an appeal against the airport&#x27;s expansion plan from the Bristol Airport Action Network. This was the final possible legal challenge.

====Work commences====
In September 2023 Bristol Airport announced the commencement of its expansion plans, starting with the construction of a £60 million transport hub and car park. This project includes the creation of one of the region&#x27;s largest bus interchanges on the top level of the new car park, with an expansion that will more than double the number of coach bays, increasing them from 6 to 16. Additionally, the new multi-storey car park will provide over 2,000 parking spaces. The project is expected to take 18 months and aims to significantly enhance transportation options and services for passengers arriving at or departing from the airport.

===2024 expansion proposal===
In November 2024, the airport opened a consultation on further expansion plans, including launching direct long-haul flights to destinations such as the Middle East and the East Coast of America and a further capacity increase to 15 million passengers per annum. The proposal involves extending the Bristol Airport terminal from approximately to approximately , significantly exceeding the existing permission to expand to . This expansion aims to enhance the customer experience with improved waiting areas, retail space, and facilities. The plans also include a runway extension within existing boundaries to support limited long-haul routes, alongside new taxiways to reduce congestion. To address traffic impacts, plans involve upgrading the A38 and nearby junctions, introducing bus priority lanes, and collaborating on future mass transit connections.

====Views for and against====
The Bristol Airport Action Network criticised the latest proposal, calling it disappointing and stating that it fails to &quot;consider the needs of local people&quot; or address &quot;its climate impact.&quot; They also described the airport&#x27;s projected economic and job benefits as &quot;misleading,&quot; citing their research, which indicates that the airport often &quot;massively overstates the number of new jobs and economic gains it will generate.&quot;

Steve Smith, the Conservative candidate for the Mayor of the West of England, expressed his support for the expansion proposal. He argued that the expansion would &quot;create local jobs, open new routes to the rest of the world, and attract greater inward investment to our region.&quot; Smith also emphasized the convenience and environmental benefits for local travellers, stating, &quot;Too many local people have to endure long drives to Heathrow or Birmingham just to access the flights they need. This is inconvenient, inefficient, and not good for the environment. Expanding Bristol Airport will provide passengers with convenience, choice, and high-quality services, right here in the West of England.&quot;

==Facilities==
Bristol Airport has one runway designated 09/27. As the prevailing wind is from the southwest, runway 27 (the westerly direction) is used about 70% of the time. The airport has one of the shortest international airport runways in the country at just in length, with runway 27 having a threshold displacement of . Despite the short runway length, the airfield is able to accommodate aircraft as large as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A330.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate scheduled flights to and from Bristol:

===Passengers and movements===
===Busiest routes===
==Ground transport==
===Road===
Bristol Airport is located on the A38, southwest of Bristol city centre. The airport is signposted from the M5 motorway, from junction 22 when approaching from the south and junction 18 when approaching from the north. Neither gives quick access to the airport, a fact which was recognised by the Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study. In November 2013, Bristol and North Somerset councils approved a planning application for the South Bristol Link Road, which provides a link from the A38 northwards to the A370 at Long Ashton, giving the airport an improved connection to the M5, and a link from the A38 southwards to Hengrove Park, connecting to the Bristol Ring Road.

===Bus===
The South Bristol Link, part of the MetroBus rapid transit route, was opened in January 2017 and is expected to provide a reduction in journey times to the airport for both bus passengers and car drivers. The Airport Flyer bus service links the airport to Bristol Temple Meads railway station and Bristol bus station. The service, numbered A1, is operated by First West of England on behalf of Bristol Airport. The same company operated the A2 service from/to Weston-super-Mare, and the A3 on a more direct route to/from Weston-super-Mare railway station. The A4 &#x27;Air Decker&#x27; service operated by Bath Bus Company links the airport with southern suburbs of Bristol, Keynsham and Bath. Service A2 now only operates as far as Bedminster. The &#x27;South West Falcon&#x27; service operated by Stagecoach South West runs between Bristol and Plymouth, via the airport and Bridgwater, Taunton and Exeter. Service 216 links the airport to Newport and Cardiff. The WESTlink on-demand bus also serves the airport.

The airport is a stop on the National Express coach network.

In September 2023 as part as the airport&#x27;s expansion plans, construction started on a £60 million multi-storey car park which will include one of the region&#x27;s largest bus interchanges on its roof, increasing the number of bus and coach bays from 6 to 16. A new bridge will connect the bus interchange to the airport.

===Proposed rail link===

In July 2016, the airport&#x27;s chief executive officer Robert Sinclair discussed the possibility of a rail link to the airport. The West of England LEP subsequently announced their application to the Department for Transport&#x27;s Large Local Major Transport Schemes fund for the &quot;South West Bristol Economic Link&quot; – a strategy designed to address &quot;poor connectivity between North Somerset, Bristol Airport and Bristol&quot;, which includes new road links as well as light or heavy rail opportunities.
By 2019, this proposal had been expanded as a mass transit line with potential for underground sections.

==General aviation==

Bristol Airport is a general aviation (GA) centre. In 2006, the GA terminal was relocated from the north side next to the control tower to a purpose-built facility on the south east corner of the field. Handling for visiting executive GA aircraft is managed by Bristol Flying Centre, which also provides engineering services and operates a fleet of business jets trading as Centreline Air Charter. Handling for light GA aircraft is managed by the Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club.

In 2012, Bristol Flying Centre doubled the size of its terminal, to , with self-contained security facilities and two new passenger lounges. Following the closure of Bristol Filton Airport at the end of 2012, Bristol Flying Centre gained fixed-base operator traffic such as the corporate shuttle for Airbus, flying to Toulouse, and the shuttle for BAE Systems. In July 2013, the Department for Transport gave approval for Bristol Flying Centre to handle charter flights directly, without needing to clear through the main airport terminal.

In 2014, a new building called The Bristol Flying School was constructed to re-house the Bristol &amp; Wessex Aeroplane Club and to contain a flying school operated by Aeros Flight Training, which formerly operated at Filton Airport.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 19 January 1970, Vickers Viscount G-AMOA of Cambrian Airways was damaged beyond economic repair in a heavy landing.
*On 3 October 2010, a Thomson Airways Boeing 767 aircraft, registration G-OOBK, landed heavily on runway 09 in severe weather conditions, reduced visibility and turbulence. The flight number 519 was from Cancún Airport in Mexico and carried 258 passengers and 12 crew members. No injuries were reported. During approach, the commander decided to perform a manual landing as weather reported at Bristol was not consistent with that presented to them at their briefing. Both the commander and co-pilot were thrown forward during the touchdown, and this resulted in the commander pushing the control column forward, to a nose down position. The aircraft then rapidly pitched up and down, before eventually settling on the landing gear. None of the pilots had recent or regular experience of landings on runway 09, and they only operated to Bristol Airport approximately twice a year.
*On 22 December 2017, a BMI Regional Embraer ERJ145 aircraft, registration G-CKAG, exited the runway and became grounded after landing at 11:35. The flight was from Frankfurt and was carrying 22 passengers and three crew. No injuries were reported. The parking brake had been applied instead of the speed brakes before landing. The aircraft touched down on runway 27, the crew lost control of the aircraft and the aircraft exited the runway and entered a grass zone to the left, crossing taxiway Hotel at speed, causing the main landing gear tyres to burst. The aircraft came to rest in the grass shortly after. The aircraft was towed to the gate some 14 hours later. The incident resulted in several flights being diverted to other airports on what was called &quot;Frantic Friday&quot; as holidaymakers and families travelled for the Christmas period.

<text>Harriet Ann Boyd Hawes (October 11, 1871 – March 31, 1945) was a pioneering American archaeologist, nurse, relief worker, and professor. She is best known as the discoverer and first director of Gournia, one of the first archaeological excavations to uncover a Minoan settlement and palace on the Aegean island of Crete. She was also the second person to have the honor of the Agnes Hoppin Memorial Fellowship bestowed upon her, and the very first female archeologist to speak at the Archaeological Institute of America. 

==Early life and education==
Harriet Ann Boyd was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her mother died when she was a child, and so Harriet was raised by her father alongside her four older brothers. She was first introduced to the study of Classics by her brother, Alex. After attending the Prospect Hill School in Greenfield, she went on to graduate from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts in 1892 with a degree in Classics (specializing in Greek).

== Early career ==

After working as a teacher for four years at academic institution in the states of North Carolina and Delaware, she followed her passion for Greece and its ancient culture, pursuing further studies in Classics at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece. She had originally intended on pursuing studies in England but she decided to go Greece based both on the brother of the archaeologist, Louis Dyer, and having heard Amelia Edwards speak while a student at Smith. During her stay in Greece she also served as a volunteer nurse in Thessaly during the Greco-Turkish War. She asked her professors to be allowed to participate in the school&#x27;s archaeological fieldwork, but instead was encouraged to become an academic librarian.

Hawes was the second person to be awarded the Agnes Hoppin Memorial Fellowship, in 1899. Frustrated by lack of support for her desire to be an active archaeological excavator, she took the remainder of her fellowship and went on her own in search of archaeological remains on the island of Crete, in particular around Gournia on the northeastern coast of the island. She made this decision even though the area was only just emerging from the Greco-Turkish War and therefore was far from safe. Her ability to speak fluent Greek, and her record of service with the Red Cross during the Greco-Turkish War a short while earlier, earned her a degree of goodwill from the local people that proved critical to the success of her work. In Crete, she visited the excavation of Knossos led by British archaeologist Arthur Evans, who suggested she explore the region of Kavousi. Hawes soon became well known for her expertise in the field of archaeology, and for four months in the spring of 1900 she led an excavation at Kavousi, during which she discovered settlements and cemeteries of Late Minoan IIIC, Early Iron Age, and Early Archaic date (1200-600 BC) at the sites of Vronda and Kastro. During that same campaign she dug a test trench at the site of Azoria, the most important Ancient Greek (i.e. post-Minoan) site in the region, evidently an early city (c. 700-500 BC). Azoria is now under renewed excavation as part of a major five-year project.
== Later academic career ==
Later the same year, Hawes returned to the United States. She accepted a position at Smith College teaching Greek Archaeology, epigraphy, and modern Greek in late 1900, and subsequently received her M.A. from Smith in 1901. She taught at Smith until 1905, interspersing her time there with frequent trips abroad for archaeological excursions.

Between 1901 and 1904, while on a leave of absence from Smith College, Harriet Boyd Hawes returned to Crete, where she discovered and excavated the Ancient Minoan settlement at Gournia on the northeastern coast of the island. Hawes was the first woman to direct a major field project in Greece, her crew consisting of over 100 workers and she was the first archaeologist to discover and completely excavate an Early Bronze Age Minoan town site. The material excavated from the site of Gournia was divided between the Heraklion Archaeological Museum in Crete and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, which supported her excavations. She was assisted by Edith Hall Dohan, her classmate from Smith College. In 1902, she described her discovery during a lecture tour of the United States and was the first woman to speak before the Archaeological Institute of America. The report of her findings, titled &quot;Gournia, Vasiliki and Other Prehistoric Sites on the Isthmus of Hierapetra&quot;, was published in 1908 by the American Exploration Society. She excavated many more Bronze and Iron Age settlements in the Aegean Sea region of the world and became a recognized authority on the area. In 1910, Smith College bestowed on her an honorary doctorate in the field of Humane Letters. Between 1920 and her retirement in 1936, she lectured at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, a historically women&#x27;s college, on pre-Christian art.

==War nursing==
Boyd Hawes became involved in wartime nursing efforts after her graduation from Smith College. She cared for injured and dying soldiers in the Greco-Turkish War (1897), Spanish–American War (1898), and World War I. Her work during World War I included bringing supplies to Corfu for wounded soldiers in the Serbian Army (1915), helping the wounded in France (1916), and founding the Smith College Relief Unit in France (1917). Boyd Hawes was director of the latter for three years, during which time she also worked as a nurse&#x27;s aide at the YMCA. After her return home, Boyd Hawes continued her support for the war effort by giving fund-raising lectures on behalf of the Smith College Relief Unit.

==Personal life==
During one trip to Crete, she met Charles Henry Hawes, an English anthropologist and archaeologist who later became the associate-director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. They were married on March 3, 1906, and nine months later their son, Alexander Boyd Hawes, was born. When their daughter Mary Nesbit Hawes followed in August 1910, Charles was teaching at Dartmouth College and the family was living in Hanover, New Hampshire. In 1920, the family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts and Harriet joined the faculty at Wellesley College. Hawes always remained committed to her academic and archaeological work as well as to her family.

==Later life and legacy==
When Charles retired in 1936, the couple moved to Washington D.C., where Harriet remained after her husband died. She died there on March 31, 1945, aged 73.

Her childhood home in Chester Square is featured on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

In 1992, her daughter, Mary Allsebrook, published &quot;Born to Rebel: the Life of Harriet Boyd Hawes&quot;. The book was edited by Annie Allsebrook, Harriet Boyd Hawes&#x27; granddaughter.

A spoof article about her was published on February 7, 2025 by &quot;The Onion&quot;, titled “Pioneering Female Archaeologist In Google Doodle Bears Silent Witness To Man’s Search For ‘Zootopia’ Porn”.

<doc id="699628" wikidata="Q156494" url="?curid=699628" title="Antonín Novotný">
<text>Antonín Josef Novotný (; 10 December 1904 – 28 January 1975) was a Czechoslovak politician who served as the President of Czechoslovakia from 1957 to 1968, and as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia from 1953 to 1968. An ardent hardliner, Novotný was forced to yield the reins of power to Alexander Dubček during the short-lived reform movement of 1968.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Antonín Novotný was born in Letňany, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary (now part of Prague, Czech Republic). The Novotný family was working class in social origin, and he worked from an early age as a blacksmith. Novotný was a charter member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (CPC) at its founding in 1921, and became a professional Communist Party functionary in 1929.

In 1935, Novotný was selected as a delegate to the 7th World Congress of the Comintern. He was made a regional party secretary in Prague in 1937 and made secretary and editor of the CPC&#x27;s newspaper in the South Moravian Region in 1938.

===World War II years===
With the coming of World War II and the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in 1939, the CPC was outlawed and forced into an underground existence. Novotný served as one of the leaders of the CPC in the underground movement in Prague. Novotný was finally arrested by the German secret police, the Gestapo, in September 1941 and was immediately deported to the Mauthausen concentration camp. He managed to survive his concentration camp experience and was liberated by the U.S. Army on 5 May 1945.

===Post-war political rise===
After the war, Novotný returned to Czechoslovakia and resumed his activity in the Communist Party. He was elected a member of the governing Central Committee of the CPC in 1946. He was promoted to the Secretariat of the Central Committee in September 1951, and became one of the party&#x27;s top leaders on the CPC&#x27;s Politburo following the arrest of Rudolf Slánský for alleged &quot;Titoism&quot; in November of the same year.

Novotný was formally appointed as Deputy Prime Minister in February 1953. After the death of party leader Klement Gottwald in March 1953, Novotný became a leading candidate in the succession struggle, ultimately winning out in September 1953 when he was named First Secretary of the party, effectively making him the leader of Czechoslovakia.

While President Antonín Zápotocký and Prime Minister Viliam Široký wanted a less repressive way of governing, the hardliner Novotný was able to outflank them with the backing of the Soviet Union. At a meeting in Moscow in late 1953, Zápotocký and Široký were told to adhere to the principles of &quot;collective leadership&quot; — in other words, abandon power to Novotný.

In the Czechoslovakia of Novotný, people continued to face strict government regulations in the arts and media, although they had loosened dramatically since Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 and the subsequent de-Stalinization programmes of 1956. His quasi-authoritarian practices led to mounting calls for a new form of socialism over the unsatisfactory pace of change that would include the accountability, proper elections, and responsibility of leaders to society. Novotný&#x27;s administration, however, still remained centralized for 10 years. During these years society evolved, seen through events such as the Czechoslovak film miracle. Following the death of Zápotocký in 1957, Novotný was named as President of the republic, further consolidating his grip on power. Three years later, he replaced the superficially democratic Ninth-of-May Constitution with a new constitution that was a fully Communist document. The new constitution declared that &quot;socialism has won&quot; in Czechoslovakia and declared the country a socialist state under the leadership of the KSČ, thus codifying the actual state of affairs that had prevailed since the Communist takeover in 1948.

In the 1960s, Novotny&#x27;s attention was turned to the activities of Czech exiles in Western Europe who were seeking to discredit his Party&#x27;s regime. One example of this was his suggestion to kidnap the exiled journalist, Josef Josten, from London in a specially made box. When this scheme proved impracticable, he proposed assassination, as recorded by the defecting intelligence agent, Josef Frolik.

===Events of 1968===
While Novotný was forced to adopt some reforms due to popular pressure in the 1960s, these efforts were half-hearted at best. Growing public dissatisfaction caused Novotný to lose his grip on power. He was forced to resign as party leader in January 1968 and was replaced by a reformer, Alexander Dubček. In March 1968, he was ousted as president and in May he resigned from the Central Committee of the CPC.

===Later years===
In 1971, during the period of normalization, he was reelected to the Central Committee. However, his political influence was minimal and he was too ill to be a strong force in the Gustáv Husák administration. He died on 28 January 1975 in Prague.

<doc id="699631" wikidata="Q3354663" url="?curid=699631" title="Operation Buccaneer">
<text>Operation Buccaneer is an &quot;ongoing international copyright piracy investigation and prosecution&quot; undertaken by the United States federal government. It was part of a crackdown divided into three parts: Operation Bandwidth, Operation Buccaneer and Digital Piratez.

An undercover operation began in October 2000. On December 11, 2001, law enforcement agents in six countries targeted 62 people suspected of violating software copyright, with leads in twenty other countries. U.S. law enforcement agents, led by the United States Customs Service, raided computers in the economics department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of California, Los Angeles, an &quot;off-campus location&quot; of the University of Oregon, and dorm rooms at Duke University and Purdue University. Information obtained led to a subsequent raid at the Rochester Institute of Technology, described by &quot;warez gadfly &#x27;ttol&#x27;&quot; as one of &quot;the two major hubs for communications between pirate groups&quot; (along with the University of Twente in the Netherlands). However, the universities themselves were not considered targets of the criminal investigation. Several software companies were also raided.

&quot;The Customs Service said it had singled out DrinkOrDie because it was considered one of the most sophisticated of the rings operating within a loose, global network.&quot; The DrinkOrDie site, where non-free software could be downloaded for free, was shut down the following day. However, Farhad Manjoo wrote in a &quot;Wired&quot; magazine article that others were puzzled why the group was targeted; Manjoo characterized them as &quot;small potatoes in the world of software theft&quot;, while an anonymous Australian infringer was quoted as saying, &quot;they aren&#x27;t the first to come to mind when you think to yourself &#x27;who&#x27;s the big deal in the scene?&#x27;&quot;

Around 70 search warrants were served and 150 computers were seized for analysis. Raids were also conducted in Canada, Britain, Australia, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Other groups investigated in the operation were warez groups such as Risciso, Razor 1911, RequestToSend (RTS), ShadowRealm (SRM), WeLoveWarez (WLW) and POPZ.

Related law enforcement actions include: Operation Fastlink, Operation Digital Gridlock, Operation D-Elite and Operation Site Down.

:&quot;This investigation underscores the severity and scope of a multibillion-dollar software swindle over the Internet, as well as the vulnerabilities of this technology to outside attack.&quot;
::— Robert C. Bonner, commissioner of the Customs Service

:&quot;Our targets are not your stereotypical teenage hacker.&quot;
::— Customs assistant commissioner John Varrone

:&quot;This is not a sport. This is a serious crime. These people should do some hard time.&quot;
::— Commerce undersecretary Phil Bond

:&quot;Software piracy undermines the stability of the burgeoning e-commerce industry and it is a direct threat to innovative companies that help strengthen the U.S. economy.&quot;
::— Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Kenneth Dam

:&quot;This investigation only assist the multibillion-dollar companies to swindle you, the avid consumer, as well as the vulnerable people that deem information should be free, sure we would like people to buy the games they test play, but it doesn&#x27;t happen because people have to pay #$ a gallon for gas and shit. Technology is to be used for the good of all, not some fat ass company man who doesn&#x27;t know the first thing from a rar to a iso... Gravy is awful good.&quot;
::— buj, Member of razor 1911

==Felony convictions==
As of October 2002, 17 people have been convicted of felonies in the United States, with 13 given federal prison terms of up to 46 months. In addition, Australian resident Hew Raymond Griffiths, the self-admitted leader of DrinkorDie, fought extradition to the United States for almost three years, but eventually lost and was sentenced to 51 months, though he was credited for the time served in an Australian jail.

In the United Kingdom, six were formally charged. In May 2005, some DrinkorDie members were the first to be sentenced in the United Kingdom as a result of Operation Buccaneer.

<doc id="699633" wikidata="Q7400421" url="?curid=699633" title="Sailor Art Thomas">
<text>Arthur Thomas (January 30, 1924 – March 20, 2003), better known as Sailor Art Thomas or Seaman Art Thomas, was an American Merchant Mariner, bodybuilder, and professional wrestler. A WWA World Heavyweight Champion, Thomas was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016.

== Early life ==
Thomas was born in Gurdon, Arkansas, the son of Alfred and Jessie (Lunon) Thomas. In 1935, he moved to Madison, Wisconsin. After his mother&#x27;s death he was raised in a Wisconsin orphanage and in foster homes.

== Merchant Marine career ==
Thomas spent 27 months in the United States Merchant Marine. Serving in a construction battalion, Thomas helped build an airstrip in Guam.

== Professional wrestling career ==
After leaving the Merchant Marine, Thomas worked for Greyhound Lines before becoming a professional bodybuilder. After joining a bodybuilding troupe, he began touring the United States. After being spotted by promoter Jimmy Demetral, Thomas trained as a professional wrestler. He made his debut in 1943. Thomas would usually be introduced as a &quot;just discharged&quot; Navy seaman, wearing a regulation &quot;crackerjack&quot; uniform and pea coat, and enter the ring as a plant to oppose the villain&#x27;s dishonorable tactics.

Throughout the early 1960s, Thomas won a series of tag team championships around North America: the Worldwide Wrestling Associates International Television Tag Team Championship with Lou Thesz in California, the Maple Leaf Wrestling NWA International Tag Team Championship with John Paul Henning in Toronto, and the NWA Detroit World Tag Team Championship with Bobo Brazil in Detroit. In 1962 and 1963, Thomas won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship in the Texas-based Southwest Sports promotion on two occasions. Thomas also competed for the World Wide Wrestling Federation from 1963 to 1964, teaming with Bobo Brazil and Bruno Sammartino.

In April 1972, Thomas won the WWA World Heavyweight Championship of the Indianapolis-based World Wrestling Association, defeating Baron von Raschke. The title was held up the next month after a bout between Thomas and von Raschke.

Thomas retired in 1981.

== Personal life ==
Thomas had seven children. He died of cancer only a month after being diagnosed with it.

<doc id="699635" wikidata="Q2118341" url="?curid=699635" title="Punchbowl Crater">
<text>Punchbowl Crater is an extinct volcanic tuff cone located in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. It is the location of the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.
==Geological history==
The crater was formed some 75,000 to 100,000 years ago during the secondary activity of the Honolulu Volcanic Series. A crater resulted from the ejection of hot lava through cracks in the old coral reefs which, at the time, extended to the foot of the Koʻolau Mountain Range. The volcano is most likely a monogenetic volcano, meaning that it only erupted once.
==Name and early uses==
Although there are various translations of the Punchbowl&#x27;s Hawaiian name, &quot;Pūowaina,&quot; the most common is &quot;Hill of Sacrifice.&quot; This translation closely relates to the history of the crater. The first known use was as an altar where Hawaiians offered human sacrifices to their gods and killed violators of the many taboos. Later, during the reign of Kamehameha the Great, a battery of two cannons was mounted at the rim of the crater to salute distinguished arrivals and signify important occasions. Early in the 1880s, leasehold land on the slopes of the Punchbowl opened for settlement and in the 1930s, the crater was used as a rifle range for the Hawaii National Guard. Anti-aircraft guns located there were fired during the Japanese attack December 7, 1941. The US Navy built the Nimitz Bowl in 1944 in Punchbowl Crater for USO Hawaii shows and sports. Toward the end of World War II, tunnels were dug through the rim of the crater for the placement of shore batteries to guard Honolulu Harbor and the south edge of Pearl Harbor.
==National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific==
During the late 1890s, a committee recommended that the Punchbowl become the site for a new cemetery to accommodate the growing population of Honolulu. The idea was rejected for fear of polluting the water supply and the emotional aversion to creating a city of the dead above a city of the living. Fifty years later, Congress authorized a small appropriation to establish a national cemetery in Honolulu with two provisions: that the location be acceptable to the War Department, and that the site would be donated rather than purchased. In 1943, the governor of Hawaii offered the Punchbowl for a national cemetery. The $50,000 appropriation proved insufficient, however, and the project was deferred until after World War II. By 1947, Congress and veteran organizations placed a great deal of pressure on the military to find a permanent burial site in Hawaii for the remains of thousands of World War II servicemen on the island of Guam awaiting permanent burial. Subsequently, the Army again began planning the Punchbowl cemetery; in February 1948 Congress approved funding and construction began.

<doc id="699641" wikidata="Q881053" url="?curid=699641" title="James E. Campbell">
<text>James Edwin Campbell (July 7, 1843 – December 18, 1924) was an American attorney and Democratic politician from Ohio. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1884 to 1889 and as the 38th governor of Ohio from 1890 to 1892.

==Early life and education ==
Campbell was born in Middletown, Ohio, where he attended the public schools and then Miami University.

==Civil War==

He served in the Union Army as a member of the Mississippi River Squadron during the Civil War. He was a master&#x27;s mate on the gunboats &quot;Elk&quot; and &quot;Naiad&quot; until his health gave out and he returned home emaciated.

==Early career==
James Campbell was admitted to the bar in 1865 and began practicing law in Hamilton, Ohio two years later. Campbell was married to Maud Elizabeth Owens of Hamilton, Ohio on January 4, 1870. They had four children.

He was a Republican who voted for Lincoln and Grant for President, and after 1872 became a Democrat.

==Congress==
After serving as a prosecutor in Butler County, Ohio, from 1876 to 1880, Campbell was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives twice from Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district (Forty-eighth and Fiftieth Congresses) and once from the third district (Forty-ninth Congress), a seat once held by his uncle Lewis D. Campbell, serving from 1884 to 1889. In the 49th Congress, he was chairman of the House Committee on Alcoholic Liquor Traffic.

==Governor ==
Campbell then was elected to the Ohio governorship, serving from 1890 to 1892. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1891, losing to future president William McKinley. During his term as governor, he signed a bill enacting the Australian ballot in Ohio. He called a special session of the General Assembly to remove the corrupt government of the city of Cincinnati. This action cost him the support of Democrats in that part of the state, and prevented his re-election. He was unsuccessful in a third run for governor in 1895.

==Later career==
Campbell was a trustee of the Ohio State University 1895–1896. Remaining politically active, Campbell was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1892, 1920, and 1924. He served on the commission to codify the State of Ohio laws from 1908 to 1911.

Campbell was nominated for Congress in 1906, but lost, and was his party&#x27;s choice for Senator in 1908, but was again defeated. In 1913, Campbell was appointed a trustee of the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Society, and he was elected unanimously by the Board of Trustees as president on September 25, 1918. He served as president until his death.

He resumed the practice of law in Columbus, Ohio after 1892.

He was a Mason, a member of the order of the Elks, the Columbus Club, the Scioto Country Club, the Presbyterian Church, the Grand Army of the Republic, the American Legion, and the Kit Kat Club of Columbus.

==Death==
James Edwin Campbell died in Columbus in 1924 and is interred in Green Lawn Cemetery.

<text>Jay Sterner Hammond (July 21, 1922 – August 2, 2005) was an American politician of the Republican Party, who served as the fourth governor of Alaska from 1974 to 1982. Hammond was born in Troy, New York and served as a Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II with the Black Sheep Squadron. In 1946, he moved to Alaska where he worked as a bush pilot. Hammond served as a state representative from 1959 to 1965 and as a state senator from 1967 to 1973. From 1972 until 1974 he was the mayor of the Bristol Bay Borough. Then, in 1974, he was elected governor of Alaska.

He oversaw the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund in 1976, which, since the early 1980s, has paid annual dividends to Alaska residents. He advocated for fiscal responsibility. When his tenure as governor was over, he continued to be active in public life. He advocated for environmentally and fiscally responsible government and individual civic responsibility. From 1985 to 1992 he hosted a television series called Jay Hammond&#x27;s Alaska. He wrote three autobiographies.

==Early life==
Jay Sterner Hammond was born in Troy, New York in 1922. Hammond studied petroleum engineering at Penn State University, where he was a member of Triangle Fraternity. He later served as a Marine Corps fighter pilot in World War II with the Black Sheep Squadron, and in China, until 1946. That year, Hammond moved to Alaska where he worked as a bush pilot and earned a degree in biological sciences at the University of Alaska.

Hammond had one daughter, Wendy, with his first wife, but that marriage ended in divorce. In 1952, Hammond married his second wife, Bella Gardiner, with whom he had two daughters, Heidi and Dana.

==Political career==
===Alaska Legislature===

Hammond served as a state representative from 1959 to 1965 and as a state senator from 1967 to 1973. Hammond served in the 1st Alaska State Legislature as an independent, joining thirty-four Democrats and five Republicans in the forty-member House. At the time, Hammond believed that a Republican could not be elected in that particular time and place, but that he could not envision running as a Democrat on account of his upbringing and background. He did serve as a Republican in subsequent legislatures, however. He was Senate President in his final two years in the legislature.

===Bristol Bay Borough===

Hammond was the mayor of the Bristol Bay Borough from 1972 to 1974. He also served as the borough&#x27;s manager during his time away from the legislature in the 1960s.

===Governor of Alaska===

Hammond was elected governor in 1974 in a close result over incumbent William A. Egan. The race was complicated by two major factors, amongst others. One was a reversal of roles of sorts, where Hammond and his running mate Lowell Thomas Jr. were identified as conservationists, confusing and splitting the traditional party base. The other was the appearance, for the first time, of a substantial third-party candidate, Fairbanks miner and real estate developer Joe Vogler. Vogler&#x27;s open contempt for the environmental movement created a further voter rift which no doubt helped Hammond.

As governor during the biggest economic boom in Alaska&#x27;s history, the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, Hammond oversaw the creation of the Alaska Permanent Fund. The concept of the Permanent Fund, originally championed in 1969 by then-governor Keith Miller and &quot;Anchorage Times&quot; publisher and editor Robert Atwood on the eve of the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale, lay dormant for years as a result of the legislature spending the proceeds of the lease sale and construction delays associated with the pipeline. During his first term as governor, Hammond, along with a young state representative from Kenai named Hugh Malone, conceived a program to invest oil royalties to cover future state budget shortfalls as well as create a long-term savings account. Alaska voters approved a constitutional amendment establishing the Permanent Fund in 1976, one of the rare exceptions to the constitutional intent of not dedicating funds for a specific purpose.
Since the early 1980s, the Permanent Fund has paid annual dividends to Alaska residents, under a program in which credit has been variously given to, or taken by, Hammond, Malone, Libertarian state representative Dick Randolph and numerous other Alaskan politicians of the day. At around the same time, Alaska eliminated its state income tax. Hammond is often erroneously credited for this; in fact, he was actually staunchly opposed to the idea. The elimination of the income tax was actually championed by Randolph, who persuaded his fellow legislators to pass the bill after mounting an initiative to force a public vote should the legislature not act. A 1980 episode of the public television program &quot;Alaska Review&quot; (currently held in the collections of the Alaska Film Archives) prominently featured an edited &quot;debate&quot; between Hammond and Randolph on the subject, centered on the fact that Alaska faced a one-billion-dollar budget surplus that year.

As governor, Hammond advocated for fiscal responsibility, and introduced an amendment to the Alaska Constitution limiting state spending. This was mocked by one legislator as &quot;Spendy Limitation,&quot; with an accompanying elegant and obfuscatory statement mimicking Hammond&#x27;s unique way with the English language. He advocated for another constitutional amendment providing for governors to serve a single 6-year term without possibility of further service. He felt it would allow governors a free hand in accomplishing their goals. He also championed a program which opened large amounts of state-owned lands near Delta Junction for agricultural use. While greater aspects of the program have been variously condemned as a &quot;boondoggle&quot; over the years, Delta Junction has managed to emerge as one of the larger agricultural producing communities in Alaska. He also vigorously fought with the legislature over power struggles between the two branches of government, culminating with four proposed constitutional amendments on the 1980 ballot, all of which failed by large margins.

==Later life==

After his tenure as governor, Hammond continued to be active in public life. He advocated for environmentally and fiscally responsible government, and individual civic responsibility. Hammond wrote articles for newspapers in Alaska, and appeared in public service announcements on television. He hosted a television series called &quot;Jay Hammond&#x27;s Alaska&quot; from 1985 to 1992. Hammond survived a rafting accident on August 6, 1988, while shooting an episode of the series on the Tana River in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Killed in the accident were Larry Holmstrom, the show&#x27;s executive producer, Holmstrom&#x27;s daughter Maria, and cameraman Ronald Eagle. Three others on the raft besides Hammond also survived, including one who also fell into the water of the Class IV river.

Hammond wrote three autobiographies, &quot;Tales of Alaska&#x27;s Bush Rat Governor: The Extraordinary Autobiography of Jay Hammond, Wilderness Guide and Reluctant Politician&quot;, &quot;Chips from the Chopping Block: More Tales from Alaska&#x27;s Bush Rat Governor&quot; and &quot;Diapering The Devil: How Alaska Helped Staunch Befouling by Mismanaged Oil Wealth; a Lesson for Other Rich Nations&quot;. The latter book, published in 2011, was co-edited by Hammond&#x27;s granddaughter Lauren Stanford. Hammond also wrote the preface to &quot;Brother Asaiah, As Remembered by Martha Ellen Anderson and Friends&quot;, a memoir of the life of Homer businessman and peace activist Brother Asaiah Bates, which was published in 2006 following the deaths of both Bates and Hammond.

Hammond&#x27;s last major public appearances were in early 2004, centered around the Conference of Alaskans convened by governor Frank Murkowski. Murkowski, recalling the spirit of the constitutional convention, assembled fifty-five delegates from across Alaska to meet at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to tackle specific questions regarding Alaska&#x27;s fiscal future. Apart from launching the political career of Mark Neuman, who proclaimed himself to be one of the few ordinary people amongst the delegates and who was elected to the state house later that year, little was accomplished by the conference in the end. Hammond spent much of the conference holding court outside of the Wood Center ballroom where sessions were held, espousing his own solutions, which included doubling the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend and restoring the state income tax, the latter of which was strongly opposed by Murkowski. The delegates responded to Hammond by endorsing an income tax proposal, which delegate Clark Gruening described as a &quot;declaration of independence&quot; from Murkowski. Several weeks after the conference, Hammond spoke before Commonwealth North, proclaiming that he would spend $50,000 of his own money if necessary to campaign for his dividend and income tax plan.

==Death==
Hammond lived at his homestead on Lake Clark, until his death at age 83 on August 2, 2005. According to his wife, Bella, he died peacefully in his sleep.

<doc id="699647" wikidata="Q17012645" url="?curid=699647" title="North American Christian Convention">
<text>The North American Christian Convention (1927–2018) was an annual summer convention supported by churches, colleges, institutions, and missions programs associated with the Christian churches and churches of Christ, mainly across the United States, but also in other parts of the world. First started in 1927, it grew gradually over the years in both attendance and location. The NACC was held annually after 1927 until the end of that decade; the deprivations brought about by the Great Depression and the dislocations caused by World War II contributed to its being held only three times in the 1930s and four times in the 1940s; it was an annual event from 1950 to 2018. Ministers from churches across the United States came and spoke at the event, as well as other well-known speakers and authors of the Christian community. The NACC Mission statement was &quot;the connecting place providing ideas, inspiration, and identity to New Testament Christian Churches and their leaders.&quot; Philosophically this organization gives all their credit to Jesus Christ. It was replaced in 2019 by the spire.network conference.

==Events==

===Adults===
Adults were able to participate in three main events: the main session, bible studies, and workshops. The main session was a time of praise and worship, sermons from guest speakers, testimonies, and a time to get to know other people. The bible studies allowed adults to get together with small groups and fellowship one on one. The workshops also allowed adults to choose from various classes in which to learn and grow.

===Teens===
Teens were involved in the same events as adults but on a level where they could have fun and grow spiritually at the same time. They had a main session with worship from high energy, world-renowned bands, guest speakers, talk sessions, and entertainment from comedians and performance groups.

===Children and Toddlers===
The NACC also had programs for young children. A day camp allowed children to have fun in groups with others their age. Each small group or camp unit was led by an adult leader who provided games and a learning environment. Daycare (Wee-One-Wigwam) was available for young toddlers and babies.

===Bible Bowl===
First introduced to NACC at the Tulsa, Oklahoma Convention in 1965, the Bible Bowl drew teens and kids in grades 6–12 every year to compete in scripture memorization and other bible events. It also allowed teens and kids to fellowship with each other and grow through bible studies, guest speakers, and prayer groups. In 2001, Bible Bowl became independent from the NACC and started its own national program as it grew, with separate competitions and events.

===Minister and Spouse===
This event focused on bringing spouses closer to each other and with God. It was a time where a husband and wife could get away to relax, laugh, smile and enjoy a few days of peace. Guest speakers and talented artists allowed for fellowship and fun while events such as hiking, golfing and shopping let husband and wife enjoy their time away.

==Leadership==
The NACC Board of Stewards, Committees, and Staff members all ensured adherence to the NACC Mission and supported the NACC through prayer, attendance and commitment to personal financial support.

===Staff===
The NACC main office was in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Staff were about 7 to 10 members who acted as project managers. They included:
*Managing director – handled day-to-day operations, finalized contracts, and managed the facility plans
*Business administrator &amp; church relations – handled the financial matters
*Special events &amp; workshops coordinator – planned &amp; set up the ticketed &amp; non-ticketed meals &amp; receptions, as well as the workshops
*Children&#x27;s convention and marketing/promotions coordinator – coordinated the children&#x27;s planning committee and the publicity &amp; marketing materials
*Information Technology Coordinator
*Registration and office services coordinator – managed registration and customer service on-site, and many other things
*Executive administration and program/production manager – worked with all the leadership committees and implement the main programming.
There were a few supporting cast members outside the office, like the person who coordinated the Student Convention, and the partner that handled the registration and hotel reservation data entry.

===Board of Stewards===
The Board of Stewards consisted of ten members who are the past President, current President, President-Elect, on average 6 members and the current NACC Executive Director. The ten of them come together and have these duties to accomplish. First, they Set and review corporate policies. Second, they worked to provide review and accountability to the Executive Director and the NACC Staff. Ensure fiscal satiability, including but not limited to, setting budgets and raising funds. Approve the venue and cities for NACC events. Then lastly they focus on long-range and strategic issues.

===Continuation Committee===
The Continuation Committee consisted of on average 120 members including all eligible past Presidents who represent the Christian churches and churches of Christ across the United States and Canada. They are a group who served as a support system and gave advice to the executive committee and the Board of Stewards. They served a three-year term in this position. These members are from all over the country, they came together every October before the next summer convention and met in the city that it was going to be held at. During the October planning meeting they assisted the executive committee plan for the future NACCs by providing guidance on potential speakers, workshop topics, and workshop leaders.

===Executive committee===
The Executive Committees were made up of thirteen members including the President, Vice President, Secretary/Treasurer, on average 6 members two local arrangement committee Co-Chairs, National prayer chair, and the NACC Managing Director. The main role the executive committee was to plan and put in order all the NACC programs for their appointed year.

===Presidency===
The President, Vice President, and Secretary/Treasurer were chosen three years before their convention summer. The current President formed a Nomination Committee in the spring before the new president was elected. After the possible candidates were nominated, the committee prayerfully chose who would fill the new presidential board. The President provided leadership and approved all recommendations for the NACC event. He served as the primary NACC representative to the constituency through travel, writing and speaking engagements.

==Conventions==

===Volunteers===
The President, Vice President, Committee members, and Board members (who had a great part in planning this event) were all volunteers. The Tech teams, teachers of the different workshops, people who watch the kids during the sessions and behind the scenes people are all volunteers. Most of them dedicated one week every summer to attend this event and were volunteers at it. Without the help of volunteers this event would not have been as large and effective as it was.

==Location==
In 1927 the NACC had its first annual summer event in Indianapolis, Indiana. Since then it was held in 20 other cities across the United States. It was usually held in the Midwest as approximately 85% of the New Testament Churches are in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, and Missouri. The average attendance was 8,000–12,000 for an average of three and a half nights. When the location was moved outside of the Midwest, attendance dropped as much as 50%.

==Support and partnership==
Churches and Christian organizations from all across the United States funded the NACC. The supporting churches helped the NACC reach out to people all over the world who come to the event. Donations ranged from $200 a year to more than $30,000 a year. Supporting churches included Discover Christian Church in Dublin, Ohio and Savannah Christian Church in Savannah, Georgia. The NACC also partnered with many Christian colleges such as Atlanta Christian College and Cincinnati Christian University, and other organizations like Good News Production International and CMF International. The NACC raised money and support for the program by holding an exhibition every year.

==Exhibition==
The exhibition allowed for hundreds of organizations such as churches, radio stations, colleges and other Christian organization to set up booths during the event and share what their school or program had to offer.

<text>Joseph Benson Foraker (July 5, 1846 – May 10, 1917) was an American politician of the Republican Party who served as the 37th governor of Ohio from 1886 to 1890 and as a United States senator from Ohio from 1897 until 1909.

Foraker was born in rural Ohio; he enlisted at age 16 in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He fought for almost three years, attaining the rank of captain. After the war, he was a member of Cornell University&#x27;s first graduating class, and became a lawyer. He was elected a judge in 1879 and became known as a political speaker. He was defeated in his first run for the governorship in 1883, but was elected two years later. As Ohio governor, he built an alliance with the Republican Party &quot;boss&quot; Mark Hanna, but fell out with him in 1888. Foraker was defeated for reelection in 1889, but was elected U.S. senator by the Ohio General Assembly in 1896, after an unsuccessful bid for that office in 1892.

In the Senate, he supported the Spanish–American War and the annexation of the Philippines and Puerto Rico; the Foraker Act gave Puerto Rico its first civil government under American rule. He came to differ with President Theodore Roosevelt over railroad regulation and political patronage. Their largest disagreement was over the Brownsville Affair, in which black soldiers were accused of terrorizing a Texas town, and Roosevelt dismissed the entire battalion. Foraker zealously opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s actions as unfair, and fought for the soldiers&#x27; reinstatement. The two men&#x27;s disagreement broke out into an angry confrontation at the 1907 Gridiron Dinner, after which Roosevelt worked to defeat Foraker&#x27;s re-election bid. Foraker died in 1917; in 1972, the Army reversed the dismissals and cleared the soldiers. Mount Foraker, the second highest peak in the Alaska Range, and the third highest peak in the United States, was named for him in 1899.

==Early life and career==

=== Boyhood and Civil War ===

Joseph Benson Foraker was born on July 5, 1846, on a farm about north of Rainsboro, Ohio, in Highland County. He was the son of Henry and Margaret (Reece) Foraker, and one of 11 children, of whom nine reached adulthood. The house in which Joseph Foraker was born was a comfortable two-story residence; his later campaign publications often depicted it as a log cabin. When Joseph was age 2, David Reece died, and the Foraker family purchased the mill and adjacent farm. There, Joseph grew up as a typical farm boy. He received little formal education, attending the local school for three or four months each winter. Nevertheless, he acquired a taste for military history, and a gift for speaking. At age 10, he became an adherent of the newly formed Republican Party. Four years later, he supported the Republican candidate, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln, in the 1860 presidential race, marching in processions of the Wide Awakes and other pro-Lincoln groups, and attending as many rallies as he could. Impressed enough by one speaker to follow him to a neighboring town, he learned not to make the same speech twice in two days—at least, not in venues close to each other.

In October 1861, Foraker left his parents&#x27; home to go to the county seat of Hillsboro where he was to live with his uncle, James Reece, auditor of Highland County, and work as a clerk in his office. He was sent to replace his older brother, Burch, by then enlisted in the Union Army as the American Civil War was raging. Foraker noted in his memoirs that while his time as auditor&#x27;s clerk greatly improved his penmanship, it also brought him into contact with many county officials, teaching him how government worked. The young clerk was impressed by his brother&#x27;s letters home, and was anxious to join the army despite his young age. Soon after his 16th birthday, Joseph Foraker learned that a family friend was organizing a volunteer company, and sought to enlist. His uncle gave reluctant consent, and on July 14, 1862, Foraker was mustered in Company &quot;A&quot;, 89th Ohio Volunteer Infantry; in late August, after training, he became second sergeant. With Confederate forces moving through Kentucky and threatening Cincinnati, the 89th was hurried into defenses set up across the Ohio River in Newport, Kentucky. The Confederates did not reach the Ohio, having been forced back well to the south, and the 89th moved to Fort Shaler, near Newport. While Foraker was at Fort Shaler, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation; Foraker recounted in his memoirs that he and his comrades felt that the proclamation meant that they were fighting for the end of slavery, not just to preserve the Union.

Later in September 1862, the 89th was sent to Western Virginia (today West Virginia) to reinforce Union forces there, and joined in their advance for a month. The regiment settled into winter quarters, but was called out for transport to Tennessee, where it helped relieve Fort Donelson in February 1863. Before this action, Foraker had seen little fighting, and the bloody scenes there were a shock to him; he wrote his parents, &quot;To know how dreadful war is you must see it yourself.&quot; The 89th remained at Donelson only a few days before being sent to join the Army of the Cumberland under the command of Major General William Rosecrans near Carthage; there, Foraker was promoted to second lieutenant. In June, Foraker led an advance guard that clashed with the Confederate rear in what developed into the Battle of Hoover&#x27;s Gap, and the Union forces slowly advanced across Tennessee, reaching Chattanooga in September. From Chattanooga, Foraker and two other officers were sent home to collect new soldiers who were expected to be drafted, but the plan to draft recruits was abandoned due to political opposition. In November he returned to Chattanooga, where the 89th was now part of the Army of the Tennessee under Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman, in time to fight in the Battle of Missionary Ridge.

In May 1864, Sherman began his Atlanta Campaign. Foraker fought in several fierce battles in that campaign, including Resaca, New Hope Church, and Kennesaw Mountain. Atlanta, or at least what was left of it after devastating fires, fell on September 2. Foraker was detailed to the Signal Corps school that had been set up by the army at Atlanta, and spent a month there. He was then assigned to Major General Henry W. Slocum&#x27;s division, and remained with that division as it participated in Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, leaving a swath of destruction behind. In late December 1864, the army reached Savannah, and Foraker, despite a storm, was able to communicate with US Navy ships offshore to alert them to the presence of Sherman&#x27;s army. After a month, the army marched north into South Carolina, determined to bring even more devastation to the state that had first seceded. Foraker was in charge of maintaining signals between the wings of the army, and was stationed on a gunboat as it moved up the Savannah River. He saw more active duty as a courier between Sherman&#x27;s main army and Slocum&#x27;s forces in March 1865 as they met Confederate forces in North Carolina in the Battle of Bentonville. On the day of the battle, March 19, 1865, Foraker was promoted to brevet captain, and was soon thereafter made aide-de-camp to General Slocum. In April, as Sherman&#x27;s army moved slowly northward, word came of the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee and his forces at Appomattox, Virginia, effectively ending the war. In early May, Sherman&#x27;s Army of Georgia journeyed north towards Washington, passing in review on May 23 before President Andrew Johnson, sworn in after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination the previous month. Foraker soon returned to Ohio, and was mustered out.

=== Education and early career ===

Foraker had been anxious to become a lawyer while a clerk for his uncle; with peace restored he enrolled for a year at Salem Academy and then in 1866 Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. He found the students who had not served in the army to be immature. He took the usual course, mostly of classics, with a few classes in the sciences, and registered as a clerk for a local attorney. Foraker courted Julia Bundy, daughter of Congressman Hezekiah S. Bundy and a student at nearby Ohio Wesleyan Female College; the two married in 1870. In 1868, he learned that newly founded Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, was offering entrance by examination to students willing to transfer. Along with fellow Ohio Wesleyan students Morris Lyon Buchwalter and John Andrew Rea, Foraker enrolled at Cornell; the three founded the first New York State chapter of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and in 1869 graduated as part of Cornell&#x27;s inaugural class of eight students. Foraker, in later years, served as a trustee of Cornell, elected by his fellow alumni.

After graduating from Cornell, Foraker moved to Cincinnati, where he resumed his study of law with a local firm; he was admitted to the bar in October 1869. Foraker&#x27;s first job in the legal profession was as a notary public; he wrote in his memoirs how time-consuming depositions were in the days before typewriters. Foraker wrote that he earned $600 in his first year as a lawyer, but by the fourth year was earning $2,700; &quot;after that it was easy&quot;.

The Forakers lived in a boarding house on Elm Street in Cincinnati for two years after their wedding in 1870. They then moved to a house in the suburb of Norwood and in 1879 built a home in upscale Mount Auburn. Joseph Foraker had initially intended to concentrate on his law practice, but in the early 1870s became a well-regarded speaker for the Republicans. In 1872, Foraker campaigned for President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s successful re-election bid. In 1875, he was for the first time a delegate to the Republican state convention, supporting fellow Cincinnatian Alphonso Taft for governor. However, Taft was defeated for the nomination by the incumbent, Rutherford B. Hayes, who that fall broke Ohio precedent by winning a third two-year term. The following year, Foraker attended the 1876 Republican National Convention as a spectator, and listened spellbound as Robert Ingersoll dramatically nominated Maine Senator James G. Blaine for president, calling him a &quot;plumed knight&quot;. While Ingersoll&#x27;s speech gained Blaine a lasting nickname, it did not procure him the nomination, which fell to Governor Hayes. Foraker supported Hayes, who was elected that fall in a close and controversial election.

In 1876, Foraker ran for judge of the Court of Common Pleas. Election fraud by Democratic political boss Eph Howard defeated Foraker and the rest of the Republican ticket. In 1878, he ran for state&#x27;s attorney for Hamilton County (where Cincinnati is located) but was defeated in another Democratic sweep. In 1879, Foraker won his first elective office, as judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati. He served three years of a five-year term, resigning in 1882 due to an illness, though he recovered after several months&#x27; rest.

In 1881 Foraker became a charter member of the Ohio Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) - a military society of veteran officers of the Union armed forces and their descendants. He was assigned national insignia number 2179 and Ohio Commandery number 21.

=== Seeking the governorship (1883–1885) ===

In 1883, Governor Charles Foster, a Republican who had held the office since 1880, looked for a Republican contender to succeed him. Foster had sought increased regulation of the liquor trade, offending many German-Americans, who were deemed likely to vote Democratic in reaction, and who were especially concentrated in Cincinnati. Few expected the Republicans to retain the governorship, and prominent candidates such as Senator John Sherman and Congressman Benjamin Butterworth declined to run. Foster saw Foraker as a candidate likely to do well: he was a Civil War veteran with a good record as a lawyer and a promising public speaker—and his Cincinnati residence might win back some votes. Others agreed; the local United States attorney wrote to Senator Sherman that the Republicans should nominate &quot;Foraker or some other unobjectionable man&quot;. Foster accordingly wrote to Foraker, offering him the chance at &quot;honorable distinction and useful service.&quot; Foraker came to Columbus just before the 1883 state convention, and sounded out state Republican leaders such as Sherman and Congressman William McKinley. When Foraker found them willing to support him, he allowed his name to be placed in nomination, and once it was clear that Sherman would not run, the convention nominated Foraker by acclamation. The Democratic Cincinnati &quot;Enquirer&quot; summed up the Republican strategy: &quot;They determined to sacrifice as little as possible, so they sacrificed Foraker.&quot;

The Democrats nominated George Hoadly, another Cincinnatian, with whom Foraker was friendly. The major issue in the campaign was alcohol—the legislature had passed a law authorizing localities to license saloons, and had authorized two referendums to allow additional regulation. Hoadly, though ill for part of the campaign with malaria, deftly maneuvered the politically inexperienced Foraker into stating that he would not vote for the referendums. This offended &quot;dry&quot; Republicans, splitting the party. Foraker campaigned throughout the state, reaching nearly every county and generally speaking at least twice a day. Nevertheless, he was defeated by over 12,000 votes, losing most counties, including Hamilton; according to Foraker biographer Everett Walters, &quot;although defeated in this campaign, Foraker gained by it; he won political repute through the state; no longer was he an &#x27;unknown. One reason cited for Foraker&#x27;s defeat was a failure to appeal to blacks, who constituted about two percent of Ohio&#x27;s population and who then mostly voted Republican.

Foraker returned to the practice of law, initially vowing to avoid politics; however, he received a number of letters offering him support in a gubernatorial race in 1885. The 1884 Republican state convention elected Foraker a delegate-at-large to the national convention along with Congressman McKinley and Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. Sherman&#x27;s political managers asked Foraker to play an active role in Sherman&#x27;s presidential campaign, and to place his name in nomination at the convention, which he did, though Walters describes his speech as &quot;weak and unimpressive&quot; by comparison with Foraker&#x27;s later efforts. Other candidates for the presidential nomination included President Chester A. Arthur (who had succeeded the assassinated James A. Garfield) and John A. Logan, but the convention was dominated by the Blaine forces. Sherman received 30 votes, mostly from Ohio, on the first ballot, but his total thereafter declined, and Blaine secured the nomination on the fourth ballot. There was talk of Foraker for vice president; he received one vote, from New York delegate and Cornell president Andrew D. White. The nominating speech made Foraker a national figure. At the convention, Foraker worked with Hanna and with Charles G. Kurtz of Columbus: both supported Foraker in the years ahead, though in the case of Hanna, only for a time. In the fall campaign, both Foraker and Hanna supported Blaine, accompanying the New Englander when he toured Ohio in October. However, Blaine was defeated by the Democratic candidate, New York governor Grover Cleveland.

Foraker received early support for a second run for governor in 1885, but said little publicly until the state convention in Springfield in June. He did, however, respond to allegations that he had discriminated against blacks in his law practice and that he had withdrawn from Ohio Wesleyan because a black student had been admitted. Foraker refuted these charges. He arrived at the convention to the strains of &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;, in reference to his Civil War service, and won an easy first-ballot victory: according to Walters, &quot;the Springfield convention of 1885 marked the arrival of Foraker, the politician.&quot; The major issues in the fall campaign were again the liquor question, at which Foraker proved more adept than two years previously, and treatment of the black voter, prompted by an incident in Cincinnati in 1884 when a Democratic-minded policeman, Mike Mullen, locked up 150 blacks the night before the general election to prevent them from voting. Foraker was again opposed by Hoadly, who had pardoned Mullen, and who had accepted a $150,000 fee from the city-owned Cincinnati Southern Railway, though the governor professed not to know how he had earned it. Foraker forged an alliance with black editor Harry Clay Smith, who would be a supporter throughout his political career. On October 13, 1885, Foraker defeated Hoadly by 17,451 votes. Although he won much of the state, he did not carry Hamilton County due to election fraud.

== Governor of Ohio (1886–1890) ==

=== Policies as governor ===
Joseph Foraker was sworn in as governor on January 12, 1886, during an intense blizzard that prevented many of the political marching clubs hoping to honor him from reaching Columbus. In his inaugural address, he urged election reform, creation of a liquor licensing bureau, the abolition of laws that discriminated against blacks, and the establishment of a state board of health. With a Republican majority in both houses, the legislature enacted many of his proposals, including the Poorman Law, requiring voter registration in Cleveland and Cincinnati (and later in all large cities), as well as the Pugsley Law, which established nonpartisan boards to appoint election officials. The &quot;Ohio State Journal&quot; commented, &quot;Not all that is needed in the way of amendments to the election laws of Ohio, but it will do for a starter.&quot; The Dow Law imposed an annual tax on businesses in the alcohol trade; most of the proceeds would go for poor relief and to the police fund. With Foraker&#x27;s support, the remaining laws that allowed racial discrimination in Ohio were repealed.

Foraker became popular during his governorship for &quot;waving the bloody shirt&quot;, that is, castigating the South for the Civil War. President Cleveland in 1887 requested northern governors to return captured Confederate battle flags. When Foraker was asked by a supporter if he would allow the banners to go South, he responded by telegraph, &quot;No rebel flags will be returned while I am governor.&quot; Cleveland backed down, and Foraker was hailed as a hero by many, receiving thousands of congratulatory messages. Foraker criticized the President for vetoing a bill increasing war pensions and for going fishing on Decoration Day. When the governor visited Philadelphia later that year for the centennial of the Constitution, he rode at the head of a regiment of Ohio militia past the reviewing stand on which Cleveland stood. When Foraker saluted, Cleveland removed his hat, but did not bow slightly as he had for other state governors. Later that day, Foraker led a troop of Grand Army of the Republic veterans past Cleveland&#x27;s reviewing stand in another parade, bearing an array of captured battle flags.
Until mid-1888, Foraker had the enthusiastic support of Hanna, who, while still boosting John Sherman for president, was a generous contributor to the governor&#x27;s 1885 and 1887 campaigns. Hanna hoped to be able to dispense patronage in northern Ohio. According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, however, &quot;unfortunately for Hanna, Foraker largely refused to grant Hanna the authority that by tradition he probably had earned.&quot; One example, later cited by Foraker as a reason his close relationship with Hanna ended, was the question of the position of state oil inspector, whose substantial fees were paid, not by the taxpayer, but by the oil companies, and who was permitted to appoint large numbers of deputies. In 1885, soon after Foraker&#x27;s inauguration, Hanna advocated the appointment of William M. Bayne, while Congressman McKinley pressed the name of Edwin Hartshorn. Hanna agreed to withdraw Bayne, not to accommodate McKinley, but to save Foraker from a difficulty. Hanna wrote to Foraker, &quot;I had a call from Major McKinley and his oil inspector candidate. ... I tell him he &#x27;wants the earth&#x27; ...&quot; However, Foraker instead reappointed the incumbent, Louis Smithnight. One of the men appointed deputy oil inspector was Harry Smith, the black editor who had supported Foraker in the 1885 election. McKinley again approached Foraker after his re-election in 1887 seeking Hartshorn&#x27;s appointment; however, Foraker appointed George B. Cox, Republican boss of Cincinnati, as chief though Smithnight was retained as a deputy. In later years, Foraker suggested the dispute over the oil inspectorship was a reason for Hanna breaking from him and allying with McKinley, stating after Hanna&#x27;s death in 1904, &quot;I have often thought since that my appointment of Cox made McKinley president.&quot;

=== 1888 convention; defeat for third term ===
Walters traces fissures between Foraker&#x27;s supporters and those of Sherman from as early as 1887. Foraker&#x27;s meteoric rise in Ohio politics was a threat to Sherman, especially as Foraker was likely to seek another office after completing his time as governor. In 1887, McKinley, Hanna, Sherman, and others met at the congressman&#x27;s home in Canton and decided to push for Sherman&#x27;s endorsement for president by the 1887 Republican state convention in Toledo, and to threaten Foraker should he refuse to get in line. Despite some anti-Sherman feeling in Ohio, the resolution to endorse Sherman was adopted unanimously by the same convention that renominated Foraker, and later that year, the governor was re-elected.

Sherman was a leading candidate for the 1888 Republican presidential nomination, commanding the support of Ohio, much of Pennsylvania, and the South. Uncertainty over whether Blaine would be a candidate hung over the 1888 Republican National Convention in June in Chicago. Although Blaine had stated he was not running, his devotees hoped he might change his mind. Sherman did not fully trust Foraker, and gave over the management of his campaign to Hanna; the presidential candidate also declined to have Foraker place his name in nomination in favor of Daniel H. Hastings of Pennsylvania. At the convention, Foraker seconded Hastings&#x27; nomination of Sherman, but the senator, on the first ballot, received few votes outside the states known to back him. Sherman&#x27;s southern support was discounted, as those states would not vote for the Republican nominee, and Sherman had paid the travel expenses of those delegates, who were for the most part black.

By the fourth ballot, on Saturday, June 23, Sherman had about the same number of votes he had started with, but faced a surge from former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison. The convention adjourned until Monday, June 25. With almost two days for intrigue, rumors swept through the convention that Blaine would be a candidate after all. Late on Saturday night, Foraker released a statement that he would support Blaine. Walters proffered several reasons for the switch: Foraker felt Sherman had no chance, resented not being thanked by Sherman for the seconding speech, and was annoyed at the trickle of votes McKinley had received, feeling that the congressman was being prepared as a backup candidate for the Sherman forces. There was also talk that Foraker might gain a place on the ticket, either for president or vice president, though he stated he would not accept a nomination without Sherman&#x27;s consent. The switch wounded Sherman&#x27;s candidacy by showing that his own state&#x27;s governor did not support him, and even though Foraker switched back to Sherman when Blaine wired reiterating that he was not a candidate, the damage was done; Harrison gained the nomination on the eighth ballot.

According to Horner, Foraker&#x27;s temporary abandonment of Sherman was &quot;the move that seems to have shattered his relationship with Hanna permanently&quot;. However, Foraker gave other reasons for the break, stating after Hanna&#x27;s death that one reason for it was that Hanna bought up the extra tickets of black Southern convention delegates, a practice that the governor considered corrupt. J.B. Morrow, the newspaper publisher who took Foraker&#x27;s statement as source material for Herbert Croly&#x27;s 1912 biography of Hanna, disagreed: &quot;it was understood at the time that his [Foraker&#x27;s] heart was not in Sherman&#x27;s candidacy ... his outraged feelings over Hanna&#x27;s bargaining with Southern delegates can&#x27;t be believed by me.&quot; According to Horner, &quot;the split between Foraker and Hanna had a profound impact on the subsequent behavior of both men, their careers in politics, and the Republican Party in Ohio, which was fractured by the dispute.&quot;

Harrison was elected in November 1888 over President Cleveland. By 1889, Foraker was openly opposed by a faction of Ohio Republicans, led by Hanna, Sherman and McKinley. Foraker felt relieved at the break, writing to a friend, &quot;From Toledo to Chicago, my neck was under a yoke, but now I am free.&quot; Despite the factional opposition, he sought a third term in 1889, hoping that if Republicans kept their majority in the legislature, he could be elected to the Senate as Sherman&#x27;s junior colleague in the legislative election to be held in January 1890. He was renominated at the 1889 state convention in Columbus on the second ballot, as the opposition to him was divided.

A law for the Sunday closing of saloons had been passed under Foraker; when Cincinnati mayor John B. Mosby proposed to enforce the law against local opposition, Foraker wired to Mosby the support of the state government. This stance alienated many anti-Prohibition Republicans. Another damaging incident was Foraker&#x27;s claim, based on documents he procured that turned out to be forged, that Democratic gubernatorial candidate James E. Campbell had supported the adoption of a ballot box made by a company in which Campbell supposedly had a financial interest. The documents also bore the signatures of Sherman, McKinley, and other Foraker enemies; they were later shown to have been taken from franked mail. Campbell was not in fact involved with the company, and the affair cost Foraker votes. A congressional committee conducted an investigation in 1891 and cleared all of those whose signatures had been reproduced. However, it blamed Foraker for using the documents without verifying their authenticity. By then, Foraker was no longer governor, having been defeated by Campbell by 10,873 votes out of some 750,000 cast. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan noted, &quot;Clearly Foraker acted hastily and unwisely because of his desperate fight against Campbell and his bitterness towards the Shermanites.&quot; According to another of McKinley&#x27;s biographers, Kevin Phillips: &quot;when Foraker lost his bid for a third statehouse term, McKinley became Ohio&#x27;s next-in-line presidential favorite son&quot;.

== Wilderness years (1890–1896) ==

=== Return to the law; first run for senator ===

Foraker returned to Cincinnati and the practice of law. Although initially he rejoined his old law partnership, he established his own offices in 1893, the year his son Joseph Jr. became an assistant in his office on graduating from Cornell. Joseph Benson Foraker Jr. was the first child of a Cornell alumnus to graduate from the university. The senior Foraker, though he accepted a broad array of cases, was a &quot;political lawyer&quot;, lobbying the legislature to grant franchises to his clients, and arranging for bills unfavorable to his clients (who included the Edison Electric Company, Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company, and the Cincinnati Street Railway Company) to be quashed.

The former governor was enraged when in March 1890, Hanna gave a speech in New York stating, &quot;Foraker is dead as a factor in our politics and Ohio is again as reliable a Republican state as it ever was.&quot; Foraker determined to secure election to the Senate; although the Democratic-controlled legislature had elected Calvin S. Brice to the Senate in 1890, Sherman&#x27;s seat would be up for election in January 1892. McKinley was defeated for re-election to Congress in November 1890; his stature in Ohio politics was not diminished by the loss, as he was seen as a victim of gerrymandering. When the former congressman ran for governor the following year, he asked Foraker to place his name in nomination, which he did. Although some saw this as a rapprochement between the Sherman and Foraker factions, the former governor&#x27;s supporters, such as Kurtz and millionaire Springfield manufacturer Asa Bushnell, were already campaigning for Foraker for Senate.

McKinley was elected governor in November 1891, and the Republicans took a two-thirds majority in the legislature. During the campaign, supporters of both Foraker and Sherman had sought pledges from candidates, and in the aftermath of the legislative elections, both men expressed confidence. Sherman was handicapped by his age (68), unpopularity, and a cold personality; according to Horner, &quot;Foraker was simply more of a man of the people than Sherman could ever hope to be.&quot; Sherman&#x27;s aide, Jacob C. Donaldson, later wrote, &quot;the situation was bad, almost desperate&quot;. Hanna had made significant campaign contributions to legislative candidates, and was outraged when legislators believed to favor Sherman instead announced that they would vote for Foraker; according to his biographer, Herbert Croly, &quot;The situation looked desperate; but it was saved, so Mr. Sherman himself stated to his friends, by Mr. Hanna&#x27;s energy, enthusiasm and ability to bend other men to his will. Three of the Cleveland representatives, who had gone into hiding, were unearthed and forced into line.&quot; Foraker was defeated narrowly in the Republican caucus, first on a vote to hold a secret ballot (which would have benefited him), and then on the endorsement vote, which supported Sherman, who was subsequently elected by the legislature. According to Horner, &quot;It is difficult to know which mattered more to Hanna—making sure his old friend Sherman kept his job or making sure that Foraker did not get it.&quot;

Sherman was not magnanimous in victory, telling friends that he would not rest until he &quot;tomahawked the last of Foraker&#x27;s crowd&quot;. Nevertheless, at the Republican state convention, Foraker and his supporters were able to gain their goal of half the delegates-at-large to the 1892 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, free to vote as they pleased. President Harrison was seeking renomination; other men spoken of as possible candidates were Blaine (who had again disclaimed any interest in running) and McKinley. Prior to the Minneapolis convention, Hanna wrote to Foraker for the first time in four years, seeking to put aside differences in support of McKinley. Foraker agreed; he disliked Harrison and did not feel he could be re-elected. McKinley finished third for the nomination, a fraction of a vote behind Blaine. Harrison was defeated by Cleveland in the November election, and McKinley was spoken of as the most likely Republican presidential contender for 1896.

=== Election to the Senate; involvement in presidential race ===
Foraker had little involvement in politics in 1893 and 1894, concentrating on the law. He still sought a Senate seat, however, and carefully planned his strategy for the 1895 state convention in Zanesville. Foraker forces gained full control, nominating Bushnell for governor to succeed McKinley, and Foraker allies for other state offices. The convention also endorsed Foraker for Senate, the first time a specific individual had been backed for Senate by an Ohio Republican convention. According to Walters, &quot;The Zanesville convention represented the highest pinnicle of Foraker&#x27;s power in Ohio politics. He had selected the platform, chosen the next governor and the complete ticket, and had secured for himself virtual election to the United States Senate.&quot; Foraker took a leading role as a speaker in the campaign, and the November election resulted in victory for Bushnell and a Republican majority in the legislature. That majority, on January 15, 1896, elected Joseph Foraker to the Senate.

Even before the senatorial election, the rival factions in the Ohio Republican Party were battling less than usual, but it was not until the day of the senatorial election that McKinley and Foraker reached a definite understanding for peace during the 1896 campaign. Foraker agreed to support McKinley&#x27;s presidential bid, and to travel to New York to approach that state&#x27;s Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C. Platt, hoping to gain Platt&#x27;s support for McKinley. In March, Foraker addressed the state convention in support of McKinley in a widely publicized speech. However, he was reluctant to be a delegate to the national convention, fearing that he would be blamed if anything went wrong with McKinley&#x27;s candidacy. It was only after considerable prodding from the presidential candidate that Foraker agreed to be a delegate, and to place McKinley&#x27;s name in nomination. McKinley desired that Foraker nominate him to show that he had the united support of the state Republican Party. Senator-elect Foraker eventually agreed, and gave the nominating speech, part of which was heard by McKinley via telephone line to Canton.

The Democrats nominated former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan, who had electrified the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech. When Bryan accepted his nomination with a lengthy address in New York, the senator-elect commented, &quot;Mr. Bryan made himself by one speech, and now he has unmade himself by one speech&quot;. Although Foraker went to Europe for four weeks (his sole trip abroad), he gave almost 200 speeches for the Republicans once he returned. McKinley was elected president with a comfortable majority in the Electoral College.

== Senator (1897–1909) ==

On March 4, 1897, the same day William McKinley became president, Joseph Foraker was sworn in as senator from Ohio. The new legislator was escorted to the bar of the Senate by Sherman; his swearing-in helped cement a modest Republican majority. Foraker continued his private legal work, which was not unusual at the time as many senators maintained business interests. Wealthy through his law practice, Foraker did not stand out in that regard either, as the &quot;rich man&#x27;s club&quot; of the Senate of that era contained about 25 millionaires.

=== Rivalry with Hanna ===

During the 1896 campaign, Hanna served as chairman of the Republican National Committee, in charge of McKinley&#x27;s campaign, and obtained millions for his presidential candidate by soliciting donations from wealthy businessmen. After the November election, Foraker met with Hanna and was surprised to learn that President-elect McKinley and Hanna planned that Sherman would be appointed Secretary of State and that the industrialist would take Sherman&#x27;s place in the Senate. Foraker objected to both components of this plan, feeling that Hanna was not qualified as a legislator, and that Sherman, whose faculties were starting to fail, should not become Secretary of State. Foraker met with McKinley, but failed to convince him.

Bushnell (who would get to appoint a temporary replacement) and Foraker (a close political ally of the governor) did not want to appoint Hanna; their faction had several candidates, including Bushnell himself, for the next election for Sherman&#x27;s seat in 1898. Bushnell and Foraker resisted for a month once the pending appointment of Sherman became known in January 1897, during which time the governor offered the seat to Congressman Theodore E. Burton, who declined. It was not until February 21 that Bushnell finally announced Hanna&#x27;s appointment, effective upon Sherman&#x27;s resignation. This controversy to some extent overshadowed Foraker&#x27;s swearing-in as senator on March 4—Hanna adherents claimed that Bushnell had delayed the effective date of the industrialist&#x27;s appointment until Foraker took his seat so that Hanna would be the junior senator. In his memoirs, Foraker denied this, noting that Sherman was unwilling to resign until the afternoon of March 4, after the new president and Congress were sworn in and the new Cabinet, including Sherman, was confirmed by the Senate. Hanna was given his commission as senator by Bushnell on the morning of March 5.

Foraker had known that with McKinley in the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still formally known) and Sherman expected to be senior senator, he could expect only limited patronage appointments for his supporters. With McKinley&#x27;s close friend Hanna instead in the Senate, Foraker was allowed to recommend appointees to the President, but McKinley allowed Hanna to exercise a veto over Foraker&#x27;s candidates.

Foraker was not visibly involved in the unsuccessful efforts to deny Hanna re-election in 1898, but several of his allies, including Bushnell and Kurtz, were part of the opposition. Foraker nominated McKinley again at the 1900 convention; his florid praise of the president pleased the delegates. As McKinley&#x27;s original vice president, Garret Hobart, had died in 1899, he required a new running mate for the 1900 campaign, and the convention chose the popular Spanish–American War hero, New York governor Theodore Roosevelt. Foraker had maintained friendly relations with Roosevelt since the two men met at the 1884 convention, but Hanna bitterly opposed the choice. Foraker spoke widely during McKinley&#x27;s successful re-election campaign.

After President McKinley was assassinated in September 1901, Foraker attended the funeral services and addressed a large memorial meeting at the Cincinnati Music Hall. When politics resumed after the mourning, Foraker spoke in defense of President Roosevelt&#x27;s inviting Booker T. Washington, a black man, to the White House. This helped ensure support from the black community in Foraker&#x27;s successful re-election bid in January 1902, which was not opposed by the Hanna faction.

Both Hanna and Foraker had been spoken of as possible Republican presidential candidates in 1904; with President Roosevelt now likely to be the nominee, both men&#x27;s presidential ambitions were pushed back four years. Hanna in particular was reluctant to publicly put aside his presidential candidacy, believing that keeping it alive would help assure his re-election by the legislature in 1904. In 1903, Foraker saw an opportunity to embarrass Hanna and boost his own chances for 1908 by getting the Republican state convention to pass a resolution endorsing Roosevelt for re-election. If Hanna supported the resolution, he made it clear he would not be a candidate; if he opposed it, he risked Roosevelt&#x27;s wrath. Hanna sent Roosevelt a telegram that he would oppose the resolution; Roosevelt replied that he expected his administration&#x27;s supporters to vote for such a resolution, and Hanna gave in.

In February 1904, Hanna died of typhoid fever, and his Senate seat and factional leadership were won by Charles Dick, a four-term congressman who had received favorable publicity due to his Spanish–American War service. Dick was able to work out an accommodation with Foraker&#x27;s faction and was thereafter considered the leader of Ohio&#x27;s Republican &quot;stand-patters&quot;, who saw no immediate need for social change.

=== War and territorial gain ===

In the year between his swearing-in and the 1898 Spanish–American War, Foraker was an enthusiastic supporter of Cuban independence from Spain. A special session of Congress, called at the request of President McKinley, met beginning in March 1897 to consider new tariff legislation; hawkish senators, including Foraker (who was made a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee), took the opportunity to press resolutions in support of the Cuban insurgents. Foraker was impatient with McKinley&#x27;s policy towards Spain, decrying the President&#x27;s State of the Union communication to Congress in December 1897 and his so-called &quot;war message&quot;, which some deemed insufficiently bellicose, in April 1898. The senator stated to a reporter of the latter, &quot;I have no patience with the message and you may say so. I have heard nothing but condemnation of the message on all hands.&quot;

Foraker had introduced a resolution calling for Spain to withdraw from Cuba, and for the recognition of the rebels as the legitimate government of an independent Cuba. The resolution that passed Congress in April called for all those things except recognition (deleted at the request of the administration) and authorized the President to use force to achieve those aims. McKinley&#x27;s signature on the joint resolution caused Spain to break off diplomatic relations and war was quickly declared. Foraker followed the war closely—his elder son was fighting in it—and was an early proponent of the US keeping Spanish colonies it had captured, such as the Philippines and Puerto Rico.

McKinley had attempted to annex Hawaii, but the annexation treaty failed to be ratified by the Senate. Congressional leaders decided to try again, this time using a joint resolution that would bypass the need for a two-thirds vote in the Senate. The American victory at the Battle of Manila Bay in early May revived interest in the Hawaiian matter. Foraker was a major proponent of the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee and was the only committee member to speak in the debate. Opposition was mostly from Democrats, who objected to the revolution by which American interests had taken control of the islands in 1893, a seizure defended by Foraker. In early July, proponents were able to get the resolution through both houses of Congress, and President McKinley signed it on July 8.

The new American possession of Puerto Rico found itself in financial woes soon after its acquisition—its principal export, coffee, was now barred by high tariffs from both Spanish and American markets. Foraker took the lead in drafting and pressing legislation establishing a civil government for the island. Although Foraker had proposed to eliminate tariffs on imports from Puerto Rico, to secure passage of the legislation he had to accept a rate of 15% for two years as the island developed a taxation system, after which there would be no tariff, and the money would be used to develop the island. The Foraker Act was signed by President McKinley on April 12, 1900. It required an American-appointed governor and a legislature in which a majority of the upper house would be American-appointed, and did not grant Puerto Ricans American citizenship. Foraker had wanted to give the islanders US citizenship, but neither the administration nor much of the Congress agreed with him. In 1901, the Foraker Act was upheld by the Supreme Court, which ruled in &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot; that the Constitution did not apply to Puerto Rico and that Congress could legislate for it (or, in the phrase then current, the Constitution did not follow the flag).

=== Opposition to Roosevelt ===

Foraker maintained generally friendly relations with Roosevelt in the president&#x27;s first term: lacking an electoral mandate, Roosevelt had pledged after the assassination to carry out McKinley&#x27;s policies. Elected in his own right in November 1904, President Roosevelt felt freer to support progressive policies. When Roosevelt told Foraker his plans after the election, Foraker initially took no alarm, but according to Walters, &quot;the resulting antagonism led to the political elimination of Foraker in 1908.&quot;

Their relationship began to break down over the question of railroad regulation. The President in 1905 sought legislation to give the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set freight rates; Foraker considered the proposed law unconstitutional, and introduced a bill by which the railroad would set the rates, and if the ICC found they were excessive, it could ask the attorney general to bring suit. Foraker spoke repeatedly against the administration-favored bill as it moved through the Senate, and was one of only three senators (and the only Republican) to oppose the resulting Hepburn Act on final Senate passage. As the Ohio legislature had passed a resolution urging Foraker and Dick to vote for the bill, he faced anger at home; one newspaper wrote that Foraker had extinguished his chances of becoming president with his vote. The following year, Foraker also broke with the administration on the question of statehood for Arizona and New Mexico, feeling that the two territories should not be combined into one state unless a merger was approved in referendums. Foraker&#x27;s position prevailed in Congress; despite his stance, Roosevelt signed the resulting bill. The two men also differed on issues of patronage, and on a series of treaties requiring Senate ratification that allowed for international agreements without the need for Senate approval. Roosevelt wrote to a friend that Foraker seemed determine to fight him on every point, good or bad.

==== Brownsville case ====
On the night of August 14, 1906, gunshots were heard in the border town of Brownsville, Texas; one resident was killed and a police officer wounded. Various military items, including discharged rifle shells, were presented by the local mayor as evidence that troops of the 25th Infantry Battalion, stationed outside of town and consisting of blacks, were responsible. When questioned, all denied involvement. Nevertheless, their white officers reported to the War Department that undetermined men belonging to the 25th Infantry were responsible, and that others of the battalion were aware of who had done it, but were remaining silent. Despite an almost total lack of evidence, on November 5, 1906 (just after the midterm congressional elections), Roosevelt ordered 167 soldiers dishonorably discharged and made ineligible for federal employment, including such decorated soldiers as First Sergeant Mingo Sanders, who had fought alongside Roosevelt in Cuba. The President adhered to his decision despite appeals from both whites and blacks.

Foraker was initially convinced of the guilt of the men, but reconsidered after evidence obtained in a private investigation by progressive organizations was presented to him (the black attorney presenting it was denied an audience with Roosevelt). According to Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, &quot;Foraker had a passion for racial justice.&quot; Recalling Foraker&#x27;s desire, as a soldier, to see slavery abolished and the black man given the same civil and political rights as the white man, Morris explains, &quot;Senator Foraker merely felt the same about the Constitution in 1906 as Private Foraker had felt in 1862.&quot; In addition to his desire to see justice done, Foraker also saw political advantage in opposing Roosevelt over the Brownsville issue; he might boost his own presidential ambitions for 1908 by making both Roosevelt and his designated heir apparent, Secretary of War William Howard Taft, look bad.

Foraker battled to have the Senate investigate the Brownsville case, and got the body to pass a resolution requiring Taft to turn over information. By late January 1907, after further investigation, Roosevelt had rescinded the part of the order barring the soldiers from federal employment, and had stated that he would reconsider the case of anyone who could present proof of his innocence. Foraker had claimed that the president lacked the authority to discharge the men; to get a resolution passed for an investigatory committee, he had to withdraw that assertion.

Matters came to a head at the Gridiron Dinner on January 27; the program showed cartoons of the leading attendees and accompanying verses. Foraker&#x27;s read &quot;All coons look alike to me&quot;, suggesting his Brownsville stance was to attract the black vote. According to Walters, &quot;the jests had been pointed and the cartoons biting&quot;; Roosevelt was seen to be angry. Nevertheless, when the President rose to speak, all that was expected was a few minutes of humorous comments. Instead, in his speech, Roosevelt attacked Foraker and defended his own conduct in the Brownsville case. Although it was not customary to permit anyone to follow a president&#x27;s speech, Foraker was allowed to reply. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Foraker &quot;gave the President the plainest talk he has probably ever listened to.&quot; Foraker stated that Sergeant Sanders had been dishonorably discharged even though &quot;he was as innocent of any offense against the law of any kind whatever as the President himself&quot;—and, he charged, Roosevelt was fully aware the soldiers had been wronged. He denied that he was after votes with his position, &quot;I was seeking to provide for those men an opportunity to be heard in their own defense, to give them a chance to confront their accusers and cross-examine their witnesses, and establish the real facts in the case.&quot; Roosevelt spoke in angry rebuttal, but according to his biographer Morris, &quot;Never before, at the Gridiron or anywhere else, had a President been challenged before an audience.&quot;

=== Defeat for re-election ===
In the aftermath of the Gridiron Dinner, Foraker was increasingly ostracized, both politically and socially. Unwelcome at the White House, he was excluded from patronage. Nevertheless, the Committee on Military Affairs, on which Foraker sat, went ahead and held hearings into the Brownsville matter between February and June 1907. Author John Weaver, in his 1997 book on the Brownsville case, takes note of &quot;Foraker&#x27;s masterful presentation of fact and law&quot;, including his cross-examination of witnesses who sought to convince the committee of the soldiers&#x27; guilt. In March 1908, the committee issued its report, by a vote of 9–4 endorsing the President&#x27;s action. While the official minority report found the evidence inconclusive, Foraker and Connecticut senator Morgan Bulkeley signed a separate report stating that &quot;the weight of the testimony shows that none of the soldiers of the Twenty-fifth U.S. Infantry participated in the shooting affray&quot;.

Although he knew he had little chance of winning, Foraker challenged Taft for the Republican nomination for president. He hoped to secure a deal whereby he would endorse Taft in exchange for support in the senatorial election to be held in January 1909. Roosevelt was determined to drive Foraker from politics, and Taft refused to deal. Taft won at each stage of the delegate-selection process, gaining all but two delegates from Ohio. At the 1908 Republican National Convention, Taft received 702 votes and was nominated; Foraker received 16, of which 11 came from blacks.

After failing to capture the Republican presidential nomination, Foraker concentrated on campaigning for re-election to the Senate. His vote on the Hepburn Act and his opposition to Roosevelt had provoked opposition to him within the Ohio Republican Party; in addition, both he and Dick were seen by some as the face of the old guard of the party, out of place in the Progressive Era. Many of those who opposed him proposed Congressman Theodore E. Burton for the Senate seat; Foraker stated that the first thing to do was secure a Republican legislature, with the question of who should be senator left until victory was obtained.

Amid speculation as to Taft&#x27;s position on Foraker, the two men met, to all appearances cordially, on September 2 at the Grand Army of the Republic encampment at Toledo, and later that day, the two men appeared on the same platform. Taft spoke in appreciation of Foraker, who, as governor, had appointed him as a judge, giving him his start in public life. Foraker, for his part, stated that Taft would be his party leader during the campaign, and called on the presidential candidate at his headquarters in Cincinnati a week later. The Taft campaign asked Foraker to preside, and to introduce Taft, at a rally to be held at the Cincinnati Music Hall on September 22. In a letter to a newspaper publisher, Taft pointed out that Foraker &quot;can be useful with the colored vote and the Grand Army vote&quot;.

The seeming rapprochement was shattered when publisher William Randolph Hearst, giving a speech in Columbus, read from letters to Foraker by Standard Oil Company vice president John D. Archbold. During Foraker&#x27;s first term in the Senate, he had done legal work for Standard Oil. In the letters, Archbold referred to legislation he considered objectionable, and also mentioned the substantial fees to Foraker; according to historian Matthew Josephson, Foraker, &quot;while occupying strategic positions in Senate committees received considerations from the Standard Oil Company running as high as $44,000 in a single period of six months - this coming at the very time when he was busily engaged in preparing the anti-Trust planks of the Republican platform.&quot; Hearst suggested the fees were a bribe for the killing of the legislation. Foraker quickly denied any impropriety, stating that the relationship was not secret and the excerpts had been read out of context. Foraker noted that when he was retained by the corporation in December 1898, it had not yet come under federal scrutiny, and when Archbold had sought to retain him in 1906, he had declined. Standard Oil was wildly unpopular, and the controversy put Taft in a difficult position. Foraker sent a letter to Taft, hand-delivered by Senator Dick, expressing his willingness to avoid the Music Hall meeting. Taft said only that he hoped Foraker would meet with the organizers of the event and follow their recommendation, which Foraker took to mean that Taft was giving credence to Hearst&#x27;s charges and did not want him there. Foraker cancelled all remaining campaign speeches. Ohio helped elect Taft and elected a Democratic governor, but returned a Republican legislature, which would elect a senator in January 1909.

Through December, Foraker worked to try to retain his Senate seat, which required action by the Ohio legislature in the era before direct election of senators. His rivals were Burton and the President-elect&#x27;s brother, former congressman Charles Phelps Taft, though near the end of the contest, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding asked for his name to be considered. Both Foraker and Burton opposed Charles Taft&#x27;s call for a caucus of the Republican legislators to determine the party&#x27;s candidate. On December 29, President Roosevelt weighed in on the question. Roosevelt &quot;lost no time in putting the Republican members of the Ohio legislature on notice that to re-elect Mr. Foraker to the Senate would be regarded as nothing less than treason to the party&quot;. Roosevelt accused Foraker of seeking to make a bargain with the Democrats to secure his re-election in exchange for a Democratic replacement for Dick in 1911. Faced with this presidential intervention and Charles Taft&#x27;s withdrawal from the race, Foraker conceded on December 31. The Republican caucus two days later selected Burton, whom the legislators duly selected on January 12.

Foraker continued to work on Brownsville in his remaining time in office, guiding a resolution through Congress to establish a board of inquiry with the power to reinstate the soldiers. The bill, which the administration did not oppose, was less than Foraker wanted. He had hoped for a requirement that unless specific evidence was shown against a man, he would be allowed to re-enlist. The legislation passed both houses and was signed by Roosevelt on March 2, 1909. On March 6, 1909, shortly after he left the Senate, Foraker was the guest of honor at a mass meeting at Washington&#x27;s Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. Though both whites and blacks assembled to recognize the former senator, all the speakers were blacks, save Foraker. Presented with a silver loving cup, he addressed the crowd,

== Final years ==

As with his defeat for governor twenty years earlier, Foraker returned after losing re-election to Cincinnati and the full-time practice of law. He found a number of well-paying corporations willing to retain him as counsel. Foraker represented the American Multigraph Company before the Supreme Court, seeking to overturn a Taft-backed law imposing an excise tax on corporations. Several cases were consolidated into &quot;Flint v. Stone Tracy Company&quot; (1911), in which the Supreme Court upheld the law.

Although he expressed bitterness upon leaving office, wishing he had never left the farm in Highland County, he soon resumed his involvement in politics, speaking for the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, Harding, in 1910. The gubernatorial candidate had previously supported Foraker, though he had backed Taft in 1908. In 1912, Foraker made speeches in support of Taft&#x27;s re-election bid, although he felt he had been badly treated by Taft in 1908. Foraker refused, however, to attack the third-party candidate, former president Roosevelt, whose candidacy split the party and led to the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.

In 1913, ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution changed the method of choosing senators from legislative vote to election by the people. Buoyed by positive reviews of his participation in the 1912 campaign, and wishing to avenge his defeat for re-election, Foraker entered the 1914 Republican primary against Senator Burton and former congressman Ralph D. Cole. When Burton withdrew, Foraker became the favorite. However, Foraker had made enemies, and others believed that his &quot;old guard&quot; Republicanism was out of date, Harding was reluctant, but was eventually persuaded to enter the primary. Although Harding did not attack Foraker, his supporters, including Cleveland publisher Dan R. Hanna (son of the late senator), had no such scruples. Harding won the primary with 88,540 votes to 76,817 for Foraker and 52,237 for Cole, and subsequently won the general election. Harding sent Foraker a letter regretting the primary result, but Foraker was more bitter towards the electorate, feeling they returned ingratitude for his previous public service.

With his political career at an end, Foraker began work on his memoirs, &quot;Notes of a Busy Life&quot;, published in 1916. Roosevelt, after reading Foraker&#x27;s autobiography, wrote that he regretted his attacks. Roosevelt concluded his letter with an invitation to visit him at his home in New York. Foraker treasured this letter, which he felt re-established his friendship with Roosevelt, although the two men did not meet in the short time remaining to Foraker.

Foraker supported President Wilson as he moved the nation closer to intervention in World War I. In April 1917, Foraker was one of a group of Cincinnatians who organized to support Wilson when the President asked Congress to declare war on Germany. Foraker&#x27;s ill-health (he had suffered several heart attacks during the preceding winter) limited his participation. On May 7, he experienced another heart attack in downtown Cincinnati. Taken home, he lapsed in and out of consciousness for three days before dying on May 10, 1917. Hundreds of prominent Cincinnatians attended his interment at Spring Grove Cemetery on May 13.

==Namesakes==
Mount Foraker, a mountain in Denali National Park southwest of Denali Pass, in the central Alaska Range, was named for Foraker, then a sitting U.S. senator, in 1899 by Lt. J. S. Herron. It is the second highest mountain in the Alaska Range, and the third highest in the United States.

== Assessment ==
Historian Allan Nevins, in his foreword to Walters&#x27; biography of Foraker, suggested that Foraker did not attain the presidency, as he had hoped, because of the ambitions of other Ohio politicians. While Foraker might have secured the nomination in 1888 as a compromise candidate, had not his pledges to Sherman prevented it, having stood aside for an older man[,] year after year he was compelled to stand aside for younger leaders. First McKinley, with Hanna at his side, was given precedence; then Taft, whom Foraker had given a start in public life, scaled the peak. Foraker, for all his administrative capacity, his wide popular appeal, and his unflinching courage, had the tragic lot of seeing a succession of associates go above him. Even Foraker&#x27;s final defeat, in 1914, proved to be part of the political rise of another president from Ohio, Harding. Nevins noted the aggressive nature of Foraker&#x27;s political style, and commented, &quot;How much of his failure to reach high office was attributable to ill fortune and how much to some of his traits, readers ... may judge for themselves.&quot;

According to Nevins, &quot;in the era which began after McKinley&#x27;s assassination he did not show the progressive qualities which the electorate increasingly demanded; indeed, he seemed positively reactionary.&quot; Walters agreed, noting that Foraker&#x27;s 1914 defeat was caused in part by fears that his &quot;uncompromising Republicanism of an earlier era would injure the party. The stirring principles of the New Freedom called for new leaders.&quot; Historian Benjamin Kendrick noted that &quot;Mr. Foraker was among the first of prominent politicians to be retired because of their too close connection with &#x27;Big Business&#x27;.&quot;

Historian Louis L. Gould, who wrote a study of the McKinley administration, stated that Foraker &quot;may well have been too close to some large corporations, but he also retained some vestiges of the commitment of the Civil War generation in the North to the idea of human equality ... This prompted him to champion the cause of the Negro soldiers.&quot; According to historian Percy Murray: [his] political career ended partially because of his support for and espousal of black rights ... Perhaps Smith best summed up his alliance with Foraker when he stated that it was time for Afro-Americans to ... show full support for Foraker and men like him who supported the efforts of Afro-Americans.

<text>Benjamin Cleveland (May 28, 1738 – October 1806) was an American pioneer and officer in the North Carolina militia. He is best remembered for his service as a colonel in the Wilkes County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the War of Independence, and in particular for his role in the American victory at the Battle of Kings Mountain .

==Personal life and career==
Benjamin Cleveland was born in Orange County, Virginia, the fourth child of John and Elizabeth [nee Coffee] Cleveland, and was of English descent and Irish descent. He moved to the area which would become Wilkes County, North Carolina in 1769. There, Cleveland built his estate, &quot;Roundabout,&quot; near what is today Ronda, North Carolina. He was noted in the early history of Wilkes County, and is known to have worked as a hunter, trapper, farmer, carpenter, and surveyor. By the time of the American Revolution, Cleveland was the wealthiest and most prominent citizen in the county. A large, heavyset man – around six feet tall and weighing over 300 lbs in his prime – he was called &quot;Old Roundabout.

Cleveland married Mary Graves, a sister of Susannah Graves, the wife of Revolutionary War patriot and frontiersman, General Joseph Martin (for whom Martinsville, Virginia, is named.)

Cleveland was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1778 and to the North Carolina Senate in 1779 and 1780.

==Revolutionary War==
Military service record:
* Lieutenant in the Surry County Regiment of militia (1775-1776)
* Captain in the Surry County Regiment of militia (1776-1777)
* Captain in the 2nd Battalion of Volunteers (1776-1777) 
* Colonel over the Wilkes County Regiment of militia (1777-1782)

Cleveland was commissioned a lieutenant in 1775 and as a colonel in 1777 in the North Carolina militia. Until Lord Cornwallis invaded in 1780, the fighting in North Carolina consisted of guerrilla warfare between patriots (&quot;Whigs&quot;) and &quot;Tories&quot;. Cleveland became known as the &quot;Terror of the Tories&quot; for his treatment of Loyalists. In 1779, two Tories looted the home of George Wilfong, a patriot and friend of Cleveland. The Tories used Wilfong&#x27;s clothes line to chase away his horses. The marauders were captured by Cleveland&#x27;s men, who had them hanged using the clothes line they had stolen. In revenge, a group of Tories led by Captain William Riddle kidnapped Cleveland. Cleveland&#x27;s men rescued him and captured Riddle and two others. All three were hanged from the same tree, which became known as the &quot;Tory Oak,&quot; and was for years an historic landmark behind the old Wilkes County courthouse (now the Wilkes Historical Museum).

===Kings Mountain===

In 1780, General Lord Cornwallis led a British army into the Carolinas, and won several victories over the patriots. Major Patrick Ferguson, one of Cornwallis&#x27;s commanders, led an army of Tories into the North Carolina mountains to crush the rebels there. A large force of mountain men attacked Ferguson at Kings Pinnacle, an isolated ridge on the North Carolina-South Carolina border.

Cleveland played a key role in the ensuing Battle of Kings Mountain. According to legend, Cleveland climbed up Rendezvous Mountain and blew his horn to summon some 200 Wilkes County militiamen. He led them into battle. Cleveland&#x27;s horse was shot from under him, and Major Ferguson was himself killed in the battle. Cleveland&#x27;s brother, Robert, is said to have rallied the militiamen during the heat of the battle, contributing to the patriot victory. Cleveland claimed Ferguson&#x27;s white stallion as a &quot;war prize&quot;, and rode it home to his estate of Roundabout.

==Later years==
After the war, Cleveland moved to the South Carolina frontier and was a commissioner in the Pendleton District.

He died at his home in Oconee County, South Carolina in 1806 of heart dropsy. An obelisk monument to him stands on private property just north of U.S. Route 123 about 160 yds (145 m) east of the Madison Baptist Church in the Madison Community of Oconee County. He was buried about 1 mi (1.6 km) away in a private cemetery.

==Legacy==
Cleveland County, North Carolina and Cleveland, Tennessee are named in his honor.

A historical marker dedicated to Cleveland reads: &quot;Colonel in Revolution, Whig leader in battle of Kings Mountain, state legislator. Home was on &#x27;The Round About,&#x27; one mile southwest.&quot;
===First historically accurate depiction and statue===
In 2012, artist Don Troiani completed the first historically accurate depiction of Benjamin Cleveland, titled &quot;Benjamin Cleveland&#x27;s War Prize.&quot; Troiani teamed with experts from across the nation to ensure accuracy. These included historical tailor Henry Cooke, a consultant for the History Channel and owner of Historical Costume Services in Randolph, Mass. Troiani asked Cooke to hand-stitch the hat and clothing that appear in the painting and required that every detail was to be embroidered by hand. The waistcoat in the painting featured hand-embroidered silk that matched a North Carolina waistcoat from 1770. Dr. Philip Mead, a Harvard University historian and expert on Revolutionary War Theory, did research through the National Archives and acquired an original Revolutionary War militia officer’s sword for the Cleveland’s depiction in the painting. Tim Wilson, the shoe and boot maker for Colonial Williamsburg, made boots identical to the ones Cleveland wore at the battle and ordered special England leather that was identical to what would have been worn in the late 18th century. Williamsburg’s arms expert, Erik Goldstein, created a scabbard for the sword that was acquired by Mead. The project was funded by local businessman and philanthropist Allan Jones. The painting features a victorious Cleveland leading his troops back home to Wilkes County on Ferguson&#x27;s white stallion.

The research that contributed to the Don Troiani painting was used to create a 500-pound bronze statue of Colonel Benjamin Cleveland. On April 19, 2013, the statue of Cleveland, sculpted by local Cleveland, Tennessee artist, Joshua Coleman, was erected in Patriots Park in Cleveland. The statue was funded by the Colonel Benjamin Cleveland Chapter of the Tennessee Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

<text>George Hoadly (July 31, 1826August 26, 1902) was a Democratic politician. He served as the 36th governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
Hoadly was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 31, 1826. As the son of George Hoadley and Mary Ann Woolsey Hoadley, his birth name was &quot;Hoadley&quot;, but he later dropped the &quot;e&quot;.

George Hoadly graduated from Western Reserve College and attended Harvard Law School, where his fellow students included Rutherford B. Hayes and John Howell. He then studied law with Charles Converse of Zanesville, followed by study with the firm of Flamen Ball and Salmon P. Chase. Upon attaining admission to the bar Hoadly practiced in Cincinnati, initially in partnership with Ball and Chase.

Hoadly was appointed as Judge of the Cincinnati Superior Court in 1851, 1859 and 1864. From 1855 to 1859 he was City Solicitor. Hoadly also taught at the Cincinnati Law School, and served as a trustee of the University of Cincinnati. Originally a Democrat, he joined the Republicans during the American Civil War because he was opposed to slavery and supported the Union. In the mid-1870s he broke with the Republican Party and returned to the Democratic fold.

In 1883 Hoadly was the successful Democratic candidate for Governor, and he served one term, January 1884 to January 1886. During his term in office, the Cincinnati Riots of 1884 broke out over a case in which a jury gave a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder. Believing the case was an obvious murder, and upset with longstanding allegations of corruption in local government, members of the public concluded that the verdict was rigged. A riot ensued as Cincinnati residents attempted to locate and lynch the killer, and 45 to 50 people died during three days of unrest and violence before militia troops reestablished calm. Hoadly was blamed by political opponents and some observers for allowing the riot to grow by being slow to react.

In addition to the Cincinnati Riot, Hoadly used the militia to end the Great Hocking Valley Coal Strike, earning criticism from workers upset that the militia was employed, and condemnation from mine owners, who argued that Hoadly should have used the militia sooner than he did. As a result of these controversies, Hoadly was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1885.

Hoadly moved to New York City in 1887, where he continued to practice law. He died in Watkins Glen on August 26, 1902, and was buried at Spring Grove Cemetery.

==Family==
Hoadly was a descendant of George (Joris) Woolsey, one of the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam, and Thomas Cornell (settler)

Hoadly married Mary Burnett Perry in 1851, a descendant of Dr. William Burnet, a surgeon on the staff of the Continental Army. Their son George earned degrees at Harvard University, and their son Edward M. graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Their daughter Laura married a second cousin, Theodore Woolsey Scarborough.

<text>Dara Ó Briain ( , ; born 4 February 1972) is an Irish comedian and television presenter based in the United Kingdom. He is noted for performing stand-up comedy shows all over the world and for hosting topical panel shows such as &quot;Mock the Week&quot;, &quot;The Panel&quot;, and &quot;The Apprentice: You&#x27;re Fired!&quot;. In 2009, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; described Ó Briain as &quot;Terry Wogan&#x27;s heir apparent as Britain&#x27;s &#x27;favourite Irishman.

In 2012, he was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for Best Entertainment Performance for his work on &quot;Mock the Week&quot;. He has also been a newspaper columnist and written books for both adults and children. His first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Beyond the Sky&quot;, was nominated for a Blue Peter Book Award in 2017.

==Early life==
Ó Briain was born in 1972 in Bray, County Wicklow, and adopted into what he described as &quot;a stable home&quot; where he enjoyed a happy childhood with his &quot;supportive&quot; parents. He attended Coláiste Eoin secondary school, a &quot;Gaelcholáiste&quot; (Irish-speaking medium school) on Dublin&#x27;s southside. He attended University College Dublin (UCD), where he studied mathematics and theoretical physics. In 2008, he remarked: &quot;I haven&#x27;t written it into my act, but it occasionally comes through. I could come on with a chalkboard and say: &#x27;Now you&#x27;re all going to pay attention.

While a student at UCD, he was both the auditor (chairperson) of the Literary and Historical Society (the university&#x27;s oldest debating society) and the co-founder and co-editor of &quot;The University Observer&quot; college newspaper. In 1994, he won the &quot;Irish Times&quot; National Debating Championship and &quot;The Irish Times&quot;/Gael Linn National Irish language debating championship; he is a fluent Irish speaker, and speaks to his father only in that language.

He played both Gaelic football and hurling for Bray Emmets and hurling for the Wicklow County minor team.

==After university==
After graduating in 1994, Ó Briain began working at RTÉ as a children&#x27;s TV presenter. At this time, he also began performing his first stand-up gigs on the Irish comedy circuit. He admitted, &quot;I did the trip from Dublin to Donegal to play to six people; then I turned round and drove home again. I did about three or four years playing to a lot of bad rooms, but learning as I went. It&#x27;s not bad when someone gives you £40 for standing up and telling jokes. I remember thinking: &#x27;This is the life. Ó Briain spent three years as a presenter on the bilingual (Irish and English) children&#x27;s programme &quot;Echo Island&quot; but came to prominence as a team captain on the topical panel show&quot; Don&#x27;t Feed the Gondolas&quot; (1998–2000) hosted by Seán Moncrieff. Ó Briain also hosted RTÉ family entertainment gameshow &quot;It&#x27;s a Family Affair&quot;.

==Stand-up comedy==

Ó Briain&#x27;s stand up international career took off around this time as he began to tour heavily, performing across Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, with gigs in Dubai, Paris, Adelaide, Shanghai and New York City. He was a regular at the Kilkenny Cat Laughs and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, as well as making one notable appearance at the Just For Laughs festival in Montreal in 2002, where he was offered a prestigious gala show because of his performances at the Irish showcase. Around this time, Ó Briain presented the weekend game show &quot;It&#x27;s a Family Affair&quot; on RTÉ Television. It was the first time he worked with former Channel 4 commissioning editor Séamus Cassidy. They later set up the production company Happy Endings Productions, and together they produced (and Ó Briain presented) the chat show &quot;Buried Alive&quot; (2003) and most famously in Ireland &quot;The Panel&quot; (2003–2006).

In 2005, Ó Briain&#x27;s eighth show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was the biggest-selling solo comedy show of the festival.

In early 2006, Ó Briain conducted his third tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland. This included shows at the Theatre Royal, in London as well as nine nights in Dublin at Vicar Street. His second night in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London was recorded for his first live DVD. His fourth multinational tour followed in late 2007, which as he says in his routine has &quot;no title&quot; but was almost entitled &quot;You Had to Be There&quot;.

He performed new tours across the UK and Ireland in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2018. His 2010 tour played for 150 dates, to over 225,000 people, including 37 nights in Vicar St. in Dublin, nine nights at the Hammersmith Apollo in London and a first date in Dubai. Each of those three tours were recorded for DVD, and the 2012 tour, entitled &#x27;Craic Dealer&#x27;, was similarly recorded during his shows at the Edinburgh Playhouse in May 2012. &quot;Craic Dealer&quot; ran for over 150 shows, as did his 2015 tour &quot;Crowd Tickler&quot;, this time with dates in Scandinavia, Northern Europe and Australia added to the tour. The tour was recorded for a DVD release.

On 12 March 2011, Ó Briain, Jack Whitehall and Jon Richardson set a new &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; title for hosting the &#x27;highest stand-up comedy gig in the world&#x27;, on a British Airways flight in support of Comic Relief.

In 2011, Ó Briain took part in two shows of the 16-date &quot;Uncaged Monkeys&quot; tour with Professor Brian Cox, Robin Ince, Ben Goldacre, Simon Singh and Chris Addison.

In October 2017, he started touring his show &quot;Voice of Reason&quot;. As well as another 37 nights in Vicar St Theatre in Dublin (to bring his total there to 197 shows), &quot;Voice of Reason&quot; was performed more than 175 times, in 20 countries, including debut shows in Reykjavík, Saint Petersburg, Malta, Germany and New Zealand. It was recorded as a BBC special at the Hammersmith Apollo, for broadcast in 2019. He had originally planned to perform the show on debut tours to the United States and Canada in 2020, but this was postponed after the first four US dates, in early March, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Canadian part of the tour resumed in August 2021.

In September 2021, he announced a new show, named &quot;So... Where Were We?&quot;, with a tour starting in November 2021. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of the tour in Ireland that was originally planned for January 2022 was pushed back to March through June 2022.
He has been touring since and extended the tour.

In February 2025, Ó Briain started his &quot;Re:Creation&quot; UK and Ireland tour.

==Television career==

&quot;The Panel&quot; was hosted by Ó Briain. Three times nominated for the Best Entertainment show IFTA (Irish Film and Television Awards), the show has a rotating cast of panellists, usually drawn from the world of Irish comedy, discussing the events of the week and interviewing guests. The most regular panellists have been Colin Murphy, Ed Byrne, Neil Delamere, Andrew Maxwell and Mairéad Farrell.

Around 2002, with his profile rising in the UK due to his one-man shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Ó Briain began making appearances on UK television shows such as &quot;Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment&quot; (a Channel 5 production) and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. In early 2003, he hosted the second series of BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Live Floor Show&quot;. His big break in UK television came in 2003, when he appeared as a guest panellist on news quiz, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, subsequently making several appearances as guest host of the show.

In 2003, Ó Briain was nominated at the &quot;Chortle Comedy Awards for Live Comedy&quot; in the categories Best Compère and Best Headline Act (which he would go on to win). In 2004, he won the Best Headliner award again, as well as being nominated for Best Full-length Show. 
From 2005 to 2022, he was the host of the comedy panel show &quot;Mock the Week&quot; on BBC Two, a blend between &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; The show reached its 200th episode during its 19th series in 2019.

On 14 September 2005, Ó Briain appeared as a guest on &quot;Room 101&quot;, where he got rid of children&#x27;s television presenters (following his work as a presenter on &quot;Echo Island&quot;) and once-in-a-lifetime experiences (he was given a once-in-a-lifetime experience on the show by being the second guest to pull the lever that opens the chute to Room 101 – the first had been former host Nick Hancock). He also got rid of banter, Gillian McKeith and magicians.

Since 2006, Ó Briain has starred in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; series, with Griff Rhys Jones and Rory McGrath. The series has included the trio rowing the River Thames, as in the 1889 novel of the same name, sailing from London to the Isle of Wight for a sail boat race, borrowing numerous vessels to make their way from Plymouth to the Isles of Scilly. In 2009, the three took to the Irish canals and rivers on a trip from Dublin to Limerick. In 2010, they explored the Isles of Scotland. In 2011, two more series were made; one travelling from Montenegro to Venice, the other travelling down the New England coast in the US to New York. In total seven series were made.

Ó Briain has also been an extensive newspaper columnist, with pieces published in many national papers in both the UK and Ireland, from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. On 9 August 2006 he hosted the first edition of his chat show &quot;Turn Back Time&quot;, which only ran for one series.

He is a relatively frequent panellist on &quot;QI&quot; and wrote about Ireland in the &quot;QI&quot; series E annual, and appears occasionally on &quot;Just a Minute&quot; on BBC Radio 4.

He also holds the record for greatest number of appearances on the BBC stand-up showcase &quot;Live at the Apollo,&quot; where he appeared seven times.

On 1 October 2009, Ó Briain released his first book entitled &quot;Tickling the English&quot;, about what he considers it means to be English. As part of its promotion, he has stated that he is enthusiastic about English culture and a student of English history, his favourite events being the Gin Craze and the civil war. In a review of &quot;Tickling the English&quot;, Ó Briain was described as Sir Terry Wogan&#x27;s heir apparent as Britain&#x27;s &quot;favourite Irishman&quot;.

Ó Briain has appeared several times in the BBC Radio science / comedy show &quot;The Infinite Monkey Cage&quot; which premiered on 30 November 2009 on Radio 4.

In 2010, Ó Briain replaced Adrian Chiles as the presenter of &quot;The Apprentice: You&#x27;re Fired!&quot;. After five years, he quit following the 2014 series.

Ó Briain has hosted the British Academy Video Games Awards 9 times between 2009 and 2019, including 2012, when highlights were also shown on Challenge.
In 2012 he hosted the Bafta Television awards, the same year he was nominated for a Best Entertainment Performance Award.

From 3 to 5 January 2011, Ó Briain and Brian Cox presented &quot;Stargazing Live&quot; on BBC Two, three programmes based at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, scheduled to coincide with the conjunction of Jupiter and Uranus, a partial solar eclipse, and the Quadrantid meteor shower. The two presenters hosted a second series of three-hour-long programmes, plus follow-up 30-minute shows called &quot;Stargazing Live: Back to Earth&quot;, from 16 to 18 January 2012. From 8 to 10 January 2013, they presented the third series, again accompanied by &quot;Back to Earth&quot;.

Stargazing Live has continued to run intermittently throughout the decade, including live coverage of the Partial solar eclipse over the Uk in 2015, Astronaut Tim Peake&#x27;s journey to the ISS in 2016, and a 50th anniversary celebration of the Apollo missions in 2019.
Stargazing Live was nominated for a Bafta for Best Live Television Event in 2017.

From 16 April 2012, Ó Briain presented an eight-episode series of &quot;School of Hard Sums&quot; with co-host Marcus du Sautoy on Dave. Each episode was themed and Ó Briain along with a guest attempted to solve various conundrums posted by du Sautoy. Series 2 began on 1 May 2013. On 6 November 2012, Ó Briain began presenting a series called &quot;Dara Ó Briain&#x27;s Science Club&quot;, in which he and other celebrities discuss science issues. The first edition of this programme features Ed Byrne talking about how closely related he is to the Neanderthals. Each episode in the series includes a short animated history that has been created by the UK animation and illustration agency 12Foot6.

In 2013, Ó Briain joined Jack Dee, Chelsee Healey, Greg James, Melanie C and Philips Idowu in &quot;Through Hell and High Water&quot;, a Comic Relief challenge which involved British celebrities canoeing the most difficult rapids of the Zambezi River. They raised over £1 million for the charity.

&quot;Dara and Ed&#x27;s Great Big Adventure&quot;, a 2015 three-part fly-on-the-wall television series, followed Ó Briain and Ed Byrne on their journey by car down the Pan-American Highway.

In June 2015, &quot;Dara Ó Briain Meets Stephen Hawking&quot;, in which Ó Briain travels to Cambridge for a series of interviews with theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, aired on BBC One.

From January to March 2016, Ó Briain presented &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Food&quot;, a three-episode series alongside Angela Hartnett, Chris Bavin and Dr Shini Somara. The BBC One show looked at the technologies and produce in farms, supermarkets, kitchens and restaurants around the world.

In 2016, Ó Briain began hosting a panel show about video games called &quot;Dara O Briain&#x27;s Go 8 Bit&quot;.

Ó Briain presented the 2016 reboot of &quot;Robot Wars&quot; starting on 24 July, as well as the subsequent two series in 2017.

He hosted a revival of the classic quiz show &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, which began airing on Comedy Central on 21 March 2019 until 5 December 2019.

In 2019, Ó Briain appeared as a guest on &quot;Hypothetical&quot;.

In June 2019, he was the host of &quot;The Family Brain Games&quot;. He co-hosted this with Hannah Critchlow, who was responsible for the psychological analysis and supported by Adam Hampshire. This programme was won by the Smith Family of Newmilns, Ayrshire.

Ó Briain also presents C4 quiz show &quot;One &amp; Six Zeros&quot;.

On 23 June 2022, Ó Briain was confirmed to star as a contestant in series 14 of C4 comedy game show &quot;Taskmaster&quot;. He won the second episode of the series with 30 points, becoming the first person in the show&#x27;s history to win the maximum possible number of points on offer in a single episode, and later went on to win the series with the highest-ever total score (later eclipsed by John Robins in series 17). In 2024 he returned to compete in the third &quot;Taskmaster: Champion of Champions&quot; special, against Sarah Kendall, Morgana Robinson, Sophie Duker and Kiell Smith-Bynoe (who was substituting in for Series 15 champion Mae Martin). Once again Ó Briain was victorious.

In August 2023, Ó Briain presented &quot;Wonders of the Moon with Dara Ó Briain&quot;; a two-part series that aired on Channel 5.

In May 2024, Ó Briain presented a two-part series on Channel 5 called &quot;Mysteries of the Pyramids with Dara O Briain&quot;.

In July 2024, &quot;Wonders of the Sun with Dara Ó Briain&quot;; a two-part series presented by Ó Briain aired on Channel 5.

==Film work==
Ó Briain had a cameo role as a generalised alternative comedian in the 2013 British film &quot;The Look of Love&quot; directed by Michael Winterbottom.

==Personal life==
Ó Briain married his wife Susan, a surgeon, in 2006; they live in West London with their three children, one daughter (born 2008) and two sons (born 2011 and 2015). He was best man at his best friend Ed Byrne&#x27;s wedding in 2008 after Byrne had previously been Ó Briain&#x27;s best man. He describes himself as looking like &quot;one of Tony Soprano&#x27;s henchmen, on a bad day&quot;, and said that in 2008, &quot;living in London I probably only get recognised about once a day. And that&#x27;s okay by me. I&#x27;m not a celebrity. And I certainly don&#x27;t see myself as one&quot;.

Ó Briain is an atheist, but has said that he also sees himself as &quot;ethnically Catholic&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m staunchly atheist, I simply don&#x27;t believe in God, even if he believes in me. But I&#x27;m still Catholic, of course. Catholicism has a much broader reach than just the religion. I&#x27;m technically Catholic, it&#x27;s the box you have to tick on the census form: &#x27;Don&#x27;t believe in God, but I do still hate Rangers.

His surname is the original Irish form of O&#x27;Brien. He said, &quot;My dad was involved in the Irish language movement and changed it. Even Irish people are now confused by it&quot;.

Ó Briain is a fan of English football club Arsenal, and of Gaelic games, having played for Wicklow county football team at minor level. When his tweet congratulating London on knocking Sligo out of the 2013 Football Championship was read out on &quot;The Sunday Game&quot;, Ó Briain expressed amazement and vowed to try to have one read out every week. Ó Briain has also expressed an interest in Irish cricket, and has written about the subject for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.
Ó Briain was one of fifteen members of a racing greyhound syndicate for several years. The December 2009 transmission of &quot;Three Men Go to Ireland&quot; featured their dog Snip Nua who, by the time of transmission, had been put down following injuries sustained in a race. Ó Briain was so upset about the death that he and his fellow syndicate members immediately disbanded the syndicate permanently. In early 2010, a series of small demonstrations were held outside some of Ó Briain&#x27;s tour venues, urging him to publicly denounce the sport of greyhound racing due to the dog&#x27;s death.

In 2020, Ó Briain tweeted that an asteroid had been named after him: 4901 Ó Briain.

In 2020, having known that he was adopted, he successfully sought out his birth family.

In 2022, Ó Briain became one of the Patrons for the Plaza Cinema, Stockport.

<text>Huang Chengyan ( third century) was a reclusive scholar who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was from Miannan (), Jing Province, which is around present-day Honghu, Hubei. He was known for being carefree and open-minded.

==Family==
Huang Chengyan married the elder daughter of Cai Feng (). They had a daughter, whose name was not recorded in history and is better known by her fictional name &quot;Huang Yueying&quot;. Lady Huang married Zhuge Liang, a chancellor and regent of the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period. Cai Feng&#x27;s younger daughter married Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Cai Feng also had a son, Cai Mao.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Huang Chengyan is a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. He first appeared in Chapter 37 when Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were visiting Zhuge Liang&#x27;s house. He appeared again in Chapter 84 after the Battle of Xiaoting, in which he led Lu Xun out of Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Stone Sentinel Maze.

<doc id="699675" wikidata="Q505643" url="?curid=699675" title="Yakovlev Yak-38">
<text>The Yakovlev Yak-38 (; NATO reporting name: &quot;Forger&quot;) was Soviet Naval Aviation&#x27;s only operational VTOL strike fighter aircraft in addition to being its first operational carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft. It was developed specifically for, and served almost exclusively on, the s (heavy aviation cruiser in Russian classification).

==Design and development==


Designed by the A.S. Yakovlev Design Bureau, the first drawings showed a supersonic aircraft strongly resembling the Hawker P.1154 in study in the United Kingdom, but with two R27-300 engines. Supersonic performance would have implied many difficulties of development, and it was decided to initially develop a relatively simple aircraft limited to Mach 0.95. Although the Yak-38 and Yak-38M were developed from the land-based Yakovlev Yak-36, the aircraft had almost nothing in common.

The prototype VM-01 was finished on 14 April 1970. Though outwardly similar to the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, it followed a completely different configuration. Together with a vectorable thrust engine in the rear used during flight, two smaller, and less powerful, engines were housed in the front portion of the fuselage and used purely for takeoff and landing.

The Yak-38 had an automatic ejection seat. If one of the takeoff engines failed or the aircraft rolled past 60 degrees the pilot was automatically ejected from the aircraft.

==Operational history==

The majority of Yak-36M initial production deliveries were to the 279 &quot;OKShAP&quot; (&quot;Otdelny Korabelny Shturmovoy Aviatsionny Polk&quot;, Independent Shipboard Attack Air Regiment), initially based at Saki, the AV-MF&#x27;s training centre in Crimea.

In July 1979, &quot;Minsk&quot; arrived in the Sea of Japan, where the vessel was home-ported at Strelok Bay, the Yak-38 component of its air wing thereafter being provided by the 311 &quot;OKShAP&quot; subordinate to the Pacific Fleet.

In September 1982, – the third &quot;Kiev&quot;-class carrier – was commissioned. By now the V/STOL technique had been well practised, and the resulting increase in the Yak-38&#x27;s overall performance and capability was exploited during the passage of &quot;Novorossiysk&quot; from Severomorsk to join the Pacific Fleet. A pair of armed Yak-38s operating from &quot;Minsk&quot; intercepted aircraft from the U.S. carrier over the Arabian Sea on 16 December 1982. This event marked the first time Soviet VTOL aircraft intercepted American aircraft while armed with missiles.

In a maritime context, the Yak-38 was not limited to the decks of &quot;Kiev&quot;. In September 1983, AV-MF pilots operated from the civilian Ro-Ro vessel &quot;Agostinho Neto&quot;, and NII-VVS (Air Force Scientific Test Institute) pilots conducted further tests from another Ro-Ro vessel, &quot;Nikolai Cherkasov&quot;. In both cases, use was made of a heat-resistant landing platform; further land-based trials tested the practicality of dispersed landing platforms, in a similar concept to the British Royal Air Force&#x27;s Harrier operations in West Germany.

==Variants==
;Yak-36M &quot;Forger&quot;:
The initial pre-production version, differing slightly from the Yak-38. It weighed compared to the Yak-38&#x27;s and the engines were slightly less powerful.

;Yak-38 &quot;Forger-A&quot;:
The Yak-38 was the first production model, it first flew on 15 January 1971, and entered service with the Soviet Naval Aviation on 11 August 1976. A total of 143 Yak-38s were produced.

;Yak-38M &quot;Forger-A&quot;:
The Yak-38M was an upgraded version of the Yak-38, the main difference being the new Tumansky R-28V-300 and Rybinsk RD-38 engines. The maximum takeoff weight in VTOL was increased from to and was in short takeoff mode. The air intakes were slightly widened and the underwing pylons reinforced to carry a weapons load. The Yak-38M entered service with the Soviet Naval Aviation after June 1985; 50 Yak-38M were produced.

;Yak-38U &quot;Forger-B&quot;:
Two-seat training version of the Soviet Naval Aviation. This version differed from the basic aircraft in having an enlarged fuselage to accommodate a two-seat cockpit. The Yak-38U entered service on 15 November 1978. Thirty-eight Yak-38U were produced, the final aircraft was delivered in 1981.

===Unbuilt projects===
;Yak-39:
Multi-role VTOL fighter/attack aircraft project dating from 1983, employing one R-28V-300 and two RD-48 engines, PRNK-39 avionics suite; S-41D multi-mode radar, larger wing, increased fuel capacity and expanded weapons options based around Shkval or Kaira PGM designation systems.

==Operators==
* Soviet Navy
** Soviet Naval Aviation
* Ukrainian Navy
** Ukrainian Naval Aviation (Former operator, was only used in limited numbers as land-based fighters after the collapse of the Soviet Union, no longer in service.)

<doc id="699676" wikidata="Q539491" url="?curid=699676" title="Angiodysplasia">
<text>In medicine (gastroenterology), angiodysplasia is a small vascular malformation of the gut. It is a common cause of otherwise unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Lesions are often multiple, and frequently involve the cecum or ascending colon, although they can occur at other places. Treatment may be with colonoscopic interventions, angiography and embolization, medication, or occasionally surgery.

==Signs and symptoms==
Although some cases present with black, tarry stool (melena), the blood loss can be subtle, with the anemia symptoms predominating.

==Pathophysiology==
Histologically, it resembles telangiectasia and development is related to age and strain on the bowel wall. It is a degenerative lesion, acquired, probably resulting from chronic and intermittent contraction of the colon that is obstructing the venous drainage of the mucosa. As time goes by the veins become more and more tortuous, while the capillaries of the mucosa gradually dilate and precapillary sphincter becomes incompetent. Thus is formed an arteriovenous malformation characterized by a small tuft of dilated vessels.

Although angiodysplasia is probably quite common, the risk of bleeding is increased in disorders of coagulation. A classic association is Heyde&#x27;s syndrome (coincidence of aortic valve stenosis and bleeding from angiodysplasia).
In this disorder, von Willebrand factor (vWF) is proteolysed due to high shear stress in the highly turbulent blood flow around the aortic valve. vWF is most active in vascular beds with high shear stress, including angiodysplasias, and deficiency of vWF increases the bleeding risk from such lesions.

Warkentin &quot;et al.&quot; argue that apart from aortic valve stenosis, some other conditions that feature high shear stress might also increase the risk of bleeding from angiodysplasia.

==Diagnosis==
Fecal occult blood testing is positive when bleeding is active. If bleeding is intermittent the test may be negative at times.

Diagnosis of angiodysplasia is often accomplished with endoscopy, either colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Although the lesions can be notoriously hard to find, the patient usually is diagnosed by endoscopy. A new technique, pill enteroscopy, has been a major advance in diagnosis, especially in the small bowel which is difficult to reach with traditional endoscopy. With this technique a pill that contains a video camera and radio transmitter is swallowed, and pictures of the small intestine are sent to a receiver worn by the patient. Recently, multiphase CT angiography (without positive oral contrast) has been shown to play a promising role in the diagnoses of small and large bowel angiodysplasia, especially when associated with active hemorrhage.

Angiodysplasiae in the small bowel can also be diagnosed and treated with double-balloon enteroscopy, a technique involving a long endoscopic camera and overtube, both fitted with balloons, that allow the bowel to be accordioned over the camera.

In cases with negative endoscopic findings and high clinical suspicion, selective angiography of the mesenteric arteries is sometimes necessary, but this allows for interventions at time of the procedure. An alternative is scintigraphy with red blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker; this shows the site of the bleeding on a gamma camera but tends to be unhelpful unless the bleeding is continuous and significant.

==Treatment==
If the anemia is severe, blood transfusion is required before any other intervention is considered. Endoscopic treatment is an initial possibility, where cautery or argon plasma coagulation (APC) treatment is applied through the endoscope. Failing this, angiography and embolization with particles is another microinvasive treatment option, which avoids the need for surgery and bowel resection. Here, the vessel supplying the angiodysplasia is selectively catheterized and embolized with microparticles. Resection of the affected part of the bowel may be needed if the other modalities fail. However, the lesions may be widespread, making such treatment impractical.

If the bleeding is from multiple or inaccessible sites, systemic therapy with medication may be necessary. First-line options include the antifibrinolytics tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid. Estrogens can be used to stop bleeding from angiodysplasia. Estrogens cause mild hypercoagulability of the blood. Estrogen side effects can be dangerous and unpleasant in both sexes. Changes in voice and breast swelling is bothersome in men, but older women often report improvement of libido and perimenopausal symptoms. (The worries about hormone replacement therapy/HRT, however, apply here as well.)

In difficult cases, there have been positive reports about octreotide and thalidomide.

In severe cases or cases not responsive to either endoscopic or medical treatment, surgery may be necessary to arrest the bleeding.

<text>A cantrip is a magic spell of any kind, or one which reads the same forward and backward. It can also be a witch&#x27;s trick, or a sham. The word &quot;cantrip&quot;, of Scots origin, possibly comes from the Gaelic term &quot;canntaireachd&quot;, a piper&#x27;s mnemonic chant. A cantrip is a term with several meanings, although primarily related to magic, tricks, and minor supernatural effects. The word and concept originated in Scotland and has been popularized in various forms of folklore, games, and modern witchcraft practices.

A Wiccan Dictionary defines a cantrip as &quot;a magickal spell&quot;.

In Scottish folklore a cantrip could refer to a trick, a minor spell, or some sort of supernatural effect. That still holds true in today&#x27;s pop culture. Today, the word cantrip is most often used when referring to Dungeons and Dragons, a table-top role-playing game, or TTRPG, that has gained massive popularity since its release in 1978. In the context of the TTRPG, cantrips are small, usually harmless spells that can be cast without expending any spell slots, though there exists some cantrips that deal damage such as Fire Bolt. Notable cantrips include Prestidigitation, Mending, and Guidance.

This usage has since spread, influencing other fantasy games, books, and media. In the trading card game &quot;&quot;, a cantrip is player-jargon referring to a spell that, in addition to any other effect, makes a player draw a card. Another popular example would be Harry Dresden from &quot;The Dresden Files&quot;. While the protagonist is a proficient mage, he often relies on simple acts of magic that could also be categorized as cantrips such as a small ball of light or creating a few sparks. In the deck-building game&quot;Dominion&quot;, a cantrip is any Action card that is self-replacing: it both draws one card and gives an Action used to play it.

<doc id="699689" wikidata="Q1074844" url="?curid=699689" title="Polaron">
<text>A polaron is a quasiparticle used in condensed matter physics to understand the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. The polaron concept was proposed by Lev Landau in 1933 and Solomon Pekar in 1946 to describe an electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms displace from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. This lowers the electron mobility and increases the electron&#x27;s effective mass.

The general concept of a polaron has been extended to describe other interactions between the electrons and ions in metals that result in a bound state, or a lowering of energy compared to the non-interacting system. Major theoretical work has focused on solving Fröhlich and Holstein Hamiltonians. This is still an active field of research to find exact numerical solutions to the case of one or two electrons in a large crystal lattice, and to study the case of many interacting electrons.

Experimentally, polarons are important to the understanding of a wide variety of materials. The electron mobility in semiconductors can be greatly decreased by the formation of polarons. Organic semiconductors are also sensitive to polaronic effects, which is particularly relevant in the design of organic solar cells that effectively transport charge. Polarons are also important for interpreting the optical conductivity of these types of materials.

The polaron, a fermionic quasiparticle, should not be confused with the polariton, a bosonic quasiparticle analogous to a hybridized state between a photon and an optical phonon.

== Polaron theory==

The energy spectrum of an electron moving in a periodical potential of a rigid crystal lattice is called the Bloch spectrum, which consists of allowed bands and forbidden bands. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One possible scenario was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice polarization (a cloud of virtual polar phonons). Such an electron with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this charge carrier the term polaron.

Landau and Pekar constructed the basis of polaron theory. A charge placed in a polarizable medium will be screened. Dielectric theory describes the phenomenon by the induction of a polarization around the charge carrier. The induced polarization will follow the charge carrier when it is moving through the medium. The carrier together with the induced polarization is considered as one entity, which is called a polaron (see Fig. 1).

While polaron theory was originally developed for electrons, there is no fundamental reason why it could not be any other charged particle interacting with phonons. Indeed, other charged particles such as (electron) holes and ions generally follow the polaron theory. For example, the proton polaron was identified experimentally in 2017 and on ceramic electrolytes after its existence was hypothesized.

Usually, in covalent semiconductors the coupling of electrons with lattice deformation is weak and polarons do not form. In polar semiconductors the electrostatic interaction with induced polarization is strong and polarons are formed at low temperature, provided that their concentration is not large and the screening is not efficient. Another class of materials in which polarons are observed is molecular crystals, where the interaction with molecular vibrations may be strong. In the case of polar semiconductors, the interaction with polar phonons is described by the Fröhlich Hamiltonian. On the other hand, the interaction of electrons with molecular phonons is described by the Holstein Hamiltonian. Usually, the models describing polarons may be divided into two classes. The first class represents continuum models where the discreteness of the crystal lattice is neglected. In that case, polarons are weakly coupled or strongly coupled depending on whether the polaron binding energy is small or large compared to the phonon frequency. The second class of systems commonly considered are lattice models of polarons. In this case, there may be small or large polarons, depending on the relative size of the polaron radius to the lattice constant .

A conduction electron in an ionic crystal or a polar semiconductor is the prototype of a polaron. Herbert Fröhlich proposed a model Hamiltonian for this polaron through which its dynamics are treated quantum mechanically (Fröhlich Hamiltonian).
The strength of electron-phonon interaction is determined by the dimensionless coupling constant formula_1. Here formula_2 is electron mass, formula_3 is the phonon frequency and formula_4, formula_5, formula_6 are static and high frequency dielectric constants. In table 1 the Fröhlich coupling constant is given for a few solids. The Fröhlich Hamiltonian for a single electron in a crystal using second quantization notation is:

: formula_7

: formula_8

: formula_9

: formula_10

The exact form of γ depends on the material and the type of phonon being used in the model. In the case of a single polar mode formula_11, here formula_12 is the volume of the unit cell. In the case of molecular crystal γ is usually momentum independent constant. A detailed advanced discussion of the variations of the Fröhlich Hamiltonian can be found in J. T. Devreese and A. S. Alexandrov. The terms Fröhlich polaron and large polaron are sometimes used synonymously since the Fröhlich Hamiltonian includes the continuum approximation and long range forces. There is no known exact solution for the Fröhlich Hamiltonian with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons and linear formula_13 (the most commonly considered variant of the Fröhlich polaron) despite extensive investigations.

Despite the lack of an exact solution, some approximations of the polaron properties are known.

The physical properties of a polaron differ from those of a band-carrier. A polaron is characterized by its &quot;self-energy&quot; formula_14, an &quot;effective mass&quot; formula_15 and by its characteristic &quot;response&quot; to external electric and magnetic fields (e. g. dc mobility and optical absorption coefficient).

When the coupling is weak (formula_16 small), the self-energy of the polaron can be approximated as:

: formula_17

and the polaron mass formula_18, which can be measured by cyclotron resonance experiments, is larger than the band mass &quot;formula_2&quot; of the charge carrier without self-induced polarization:

: formula_20

When the coupling is strong (α large), a variational approach due to Landau and Pekar indicates that the self-energy is proportional to α² and the polaron mass scales as &quot;α&quot;⁴. The Landau–Pekar variational calculation
yields an upper bound to the polaron self-energy formula_21, valid for &quot;all&quot; &quot;α&quot;, where formula_22 is a constant determined by solving an integro-differential equation. It was an open question for many years whether this expression was asymptotically exact as α tends to infinity. Finally, Donsker and Varadhan, applying large deviation theory to Feynman&#x27;s path integral formulation for the self-energy, showed the large α exactitude of this Landau–Pekar formula. Later, Lieb and Thomas gave a shorter proof using more conventional methods, and with explicit bounds on the lower order corrections to the Landau–Pekar formula.

Feynman introduced the variational principle for path integrals to study the polaron. He simulated the interaction between the electron and the polarization modes by a harmonic interaction between a hypothetical particle and the electron. The analysis of an exactly solvable (&quot;symmetrical&quot;) 1D-polaron model, Monte Carlo schemes and other numerical schemes demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of Feynman&#x27;s path-integral approach to the polaron ground-state energy. Experimentally more directly accessible properties of the polaron, such as its mobility and optical absorption, have been investigated subsequently.

In the strong coupling limit, formula_23, the spectrum of excited states of a polaron begins with polaron-phonon bound states with energies less than formula_24, where formula_25 is the frequency of optical phonons.

In the lattice models the main parameter is the polaron binding energy: formula_26, here summation is taken over the Brillouin zone. Note that this binding energy is purely adiabatic, i.e. does not depend on the ionic masses. For polar crystals the value of the polaron binding energy is strictly determined by the dielectric constants formula_27,formula_28, and is of the order of 0.3-0.8 eV. If polaron binding energy formula_29 is smaller than the hopping integral the large polaron is formed for some type of electron-phonon interactions. In the case when formula_30 the small polaron is formed. There are two limiting cases in the lattice polaron theory. In the physically important adiabatic limit formula_31 all terms which involve ionic masses are cancelled and formation of polaron is described by nonlinear Schrödinger equation with nonadiabatic correction describing phonon frequency renormalization and polaron tunneling.
 In the opposite limit formula_32 the theory represents the expansion in formula_33.

== Polaron optical absorption ==
The expression for the magnetooptical absorption of a polaron is:

: formula_34

Here, formula_35 is the cyclotron frequency for a rigid-band electron. The magnetooptical absorption Γ(Ω) at the frequency Ω takes the form Σ(Ω) is the so-called &quot;memory function&quot;, which describes the dynamics of the polaron. Σ(Ω) depends also on α, β (βformula_36, where formula_37 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_38 is the temperature) and formula_39.

In the absence of an external magnetic field (formula_40) the optical absorption spectrum (3) of the polaron at weak coupling is determined by the absorption of radiation energy, which is reemitted in the form of LO phonons. At larger coupling, formula_41, the polaron can undergo transitions toward a relatively stable internal excited state called the &quot;relaxed excited state&quot; (RES) (see Fig. 2). The RES peak in the spectrum also has a phonon sideband, which is related to a Franck–Condon-type transition.

A comparison of the DSG results with the optical conductivity spectra given by approximation-free numerical and approximate analytical approaches is given in ref.

Calculations of the optical conductivity for the Fröhlich polaron performed within the Diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo method, see Fig. 3, fully confirm the results of the path-integral variational approach at formula_42 In the intermediate coupling regime formula_43 the low-energy behavior and the position of the maximum of the optical conductivity spectrum of ref. follow well the prediction of Devreese. There are the following qualitative differences between the two approaches in the intermediate and strong coupling regime: in ref., the dominant peak broadens and the second peak does not develop, giving instead rise to a flat shoulder in the optical conductivity spectrum at formula_44. This behavior can be attributed to the optical processes with participation of two or more phonons. The nature of the excited states of a polaron needs further study.

The application of a sufficiently strong external magnetic field allows one to satisfy the resonance condition formula_45, which {(for formula_46)} determines the polaron cyclotron resonance frequency. From this condition also the polaron cyclotron mass can be derived. Using the most accurate theoretical polaron models to evaluate formula_47, the experimental cyclotron data can be well accounted for.

Evidence for the polaron character of charge carriers in AgBr and AgCl was obtained through high-precision cyclotron resonance experiments in external magnetic fields up to 16 T. The all-coupling magneto-absorption calculated in ref., leads to the best quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for AgBr and AgCl. This quantitative interpretation of the cyclotron resonance experiment in AgBr and
AgCl by the theory of Peeters provided one of the most convincing and clearest demonstrations of Fröhlich polaron features in solids.

Experimental data on the magnetopolaron effect, obtained using far-infrared photoconductivity techniques, have been applied to study the energy spectrum of shallow donors in polar semiconductor layers of CdTe.

The polaron effect well above the LO phonon energy was studied through cyclotron resonance measurements, e. g., in II–VI semiconductors, observed in ultra-high magnetic fields. The resonant polaron effect manifests itself when the cyclotron frequency approaches the LO phonon energy in sufficiently high magnetic fields.

In the lattice models the optical conductivity is given by the formula:
: formula_48
Here formula_49 is the activation energy of polaron, which is of the order of polaron binding energy formula_29. This formula was derived and extensively discussed in and was tested experimentally for example in photodoped parent compounds of high temperature superconductors.

== Polarons in two dimensions and in quasi-2D structures ==

The great interest in the study of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) has also resulted in many investigations on the properties of polarons in two dimensions. A simple model for the 2D polaron system consists of an electron confined to a plane, interacting via the Fröhlich interaction with the LO phonons of a 3D surrounding medium. The self-energy and the mass of such a 2D polaron are no longer described by the expressions valid in 3D; for weak coupling they can be approximated as:

: formula_51

: formula_52

It has been shown that simple scaling relations exist, connecting the physical properties of polarons in 2D with those in 3D. An example of such a scaling relation is:

: formula_53

where formula_54 (formula_55) and formula_56 (formula_57) are, respectively, the polaron and the electron-band masses in 2D (3D).

The effect of the confinement of a Fröhlich polaron is to enhance the &quot;effective&quot; polaron coupling. However, many-particle effects tend to counterbalance this effect because of screening.

Also in 2D systems cyclotron resonance is a convenient tool to study polaron effects. Although several other effects have to be taken into account (nonparabolicity of the electron bands, many-body effects, the nature of the confining potential, etc.), the polaron effect is clearly revealed in the cyclotron mass. An interesting 2D system consists of electrons on films of liquid He. In this system the electrons couple to the ripplons of the liquid He, forming &quot;ripplopolarons&quot;. The effective coupling can be relatively large and, for some values of the parameters, self-trapping can result. The acoustic nature of the ripplon dispersion at long wavelengths is a key aspect of the trapping.
For GaAs/AlxGa1−xAs quantum wells and superlattices, the polaron effect is found to decrease the energy of the shallow donor states at low magnetic fields and leads to a resonant splitting of the energies at high magnetic fields. The energy spectra of such polaronic systems as shallow donors (&quot;bound polarons&quot;), e. g., the D0 and D− centres, constitute the most complete and detailed polaron spectroscopy realised in the literature.

In GaAs/AlAs quantum wells with sufficiently high electron density, anticrossing of the cyclotron-resonance spectra has been observed near the GaAs transverse optical (TO) phonon frequency rather than near the GaAs LO-phonon frequency. This anticrossing near the TO-phonon frequency was explained in the framework of the polaron theory.

Besides optical properties, many other physical properties of polarons have been studied, including the possibility of self-trapping, polaron transport, magnetophonon resonance, etc.

== Extensions of the polaron concept ==

Significant are also the extensions of the polaron concept: acoustic polaron, piezoelectric polaron, electronic polaron, bound polaron, trapped polaron, spin polaron, molecular polaron, solvated polarons, polaronic exciton, Jahn-Teller polaron, small polaron, bipolarons and many-polaron systems. These extensions of the concept are invoked, e. g., to study the properties of conjugated polymers, colossal magnetoresistance perovskites, high-formula_58 superconductors, layered MgB2 superconductors, fullerenes, quasi-1D conductors, semiconductor nanostructures.

The possibility that polarons and bipolarons play a role in high-formula_58 superconductors has renewed interest in the physical properties of many-polaron systems and, in particular, in their optical properties. Theoretical treatments have been extended from one-polaron to many-polaron systems.

A new aspect of the polaron concept has been investigated for semiconductor nanostructures: the exciton-phonon states are not factorizable into an adiabatic product Ansatz, so that a &quot;non-adiabatic&quot; treatment is needed. The &quot;non-adiabaticity&quot; of the exciton-phonon systems leads to a strong enhancement of the phonon-assisted transition probabilities (as compared to those treated adiabatically) and to multiphonon optical spectra that are considerably different from the Franck–Condon progression even for small values of the electron-phonon coupling constant as is the case for typical semiconductor nanostructures.

In biophysics Davydov soliton is a propagating along the protein α-helix self-trapped amide I excitation that is a solution of the Davydov Hamiltonian. The mathematical techniques that are used to analyze Davydov&#x27;s soliton are similar to some that have been developed in polaron theory. In this context the Davydov soliton corresponds to a &quot;polaron&quot; that is (i) &quot;large&quot; so the continuum limit approximation in justified, (ii) &quot;acoustic&quot; because the self-localization arises from interactions with acoustic modes of the lattice, and (iii) &quot;weakly coupled&quot; because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth.

It has been shown that the system of an impurity in a Bose–Einstein condensate is also a member of the polaron family. This allows the hitherto inaccessible strong coupling regime to be studied, since the interaction strengths can be externally tuned through the use of a Feshbach resonance. This was recently realized experimentally by two research groups.
The existence of the polaron in a Bose–Einstein condensate was demonstrated for both attractive and repulsive interactions, including the strong coupling regime and dynamically observed.

<text>Platform shoes are shoes, boots, or sandals with a thick sole, usually in the range of . Platform shoes may also be high heels, in which case the heel is raised significantly higher than the ball of the foot. Extreme heights, of both the sole and heel, can be found in fetish footwear such as ballet boots, where the sole may be up to high and the heels up to or more. The sole of a platform shoe can have a continuous uniform thickness, have a wedge, a separate block or a stiletto heel. Raising the ankle increases the risk of a sprained ankle.

==History==
Platform shoes are known in many cultures. The most famous predecessor of platform shoes are the Zoccoli in Venice of the 15th century, designed with the functional goal of avoiding wet feet when the pavements were flooded. Depending on the current shoe fashion, platform shoes are more or less popular. In the 1970s they were widespread in both genders in Europe. Today, they are preferred by women.

===Ancient===

After their use in Ancient Greece for raising the height of important characters in the Greek theatre and their similar use by high-born prostitutes or courtesans in London in the sixteenth century, platform shoes, called pattens, are thought to have been worn in Europe in the eighteenth century to avoid the muck of urban streets. Of the same practical origins are Japanese &quot;geta&quot;. There may also be a connection to the buskins of Ancient Rome, which frequently had very thick soles to give added height to the wearer. Another example of a platform shoe that functioned as protection from dirt and grime is the Okobo- &quot;Okobo&quot; referring to the sound that the wooden shoe makes when walking. Dating back to 18th century Japan, the Okobo was worn by maikos, or geishas, during their apprenticeships. Similar to the Okobo, wooden Kabkabs were named after the sound they made upon marble flooring. Worn by Lebanese women between the 14th and 17th centuries, the straps were often made from velvet, leather, or silk while the wooden stilts were decorated with silver or pearl. The ancient Indian Paduka, which translates to footprints of the Gods, was often sported by the upper echelon as a way to mark their status. The wooden platforms were sometimes carved into different animal shapes and decorated with ivory and silver. In ancient China, men wore black boots with very thick soles made from layers of white cloths. This style of boots is often worn today onstage for Peking opera. During the Qing dynasty, aristocratic Manchu women wore a form of platform known as the flowerpot shoe to imitate the gait of Han women with bound feet and their lotus shoes.

===Modern===
Platform shoes enjoyed some popularity in the United States, Europe and the UK from the 1930s to the 1950s but not nearly to the extent of their popularity from the 1960s to the 1980s.

====20th century====
===== 1930s–1950s =====

In the early 1930s, Moshe (Morris) Kimel designed the first modern version of the platform shoe for actress Marlene Dietrich. Kimel, a Jew, escaped Berlin, Germany, and settled in the United States with his family in 1939 and opened the Kimel shoe factory in Los Angeles. The design soon became very popular amongst Beverly Hills elite.
In 1938, The Rainbow was a platform sandal designed by famous shoe designer Salvatore Ferragamo. “The Rainbow” was created and was the first instance of the platform shoe returning in modern days in the West. The platform sandal was designed for Judy Garland, an American singer, actress, and vaudevillian. This shoe was a tribute to Judy Garland&#x27;s signature song “Over the Rainbow” performed in the Wizard of Oz in 1939. The shoe was a crafted using uniquely shaped slabs of cork that were covered in suede to build up the wedge and gold kidskin was used for the straps. His creation was a result of experimentations with new materials because of wartime rationing during World War II. Traditionally heels were built up with leather, but because of the rationing of leather, he experimented with wood and cork The colors and design of this shoe still resemble modern shoe standards today.

In the 1940s, platforms were designed with a high arch, but as exemplified here, they originated with the heel elevated only slightly above the toes. The platform brings a heavy looking foundation to the wearer that is in direct polarity to the stiletto heel. With its reconfiguration of the arch and structure of attenuated insubstantiality, the high heel suggests the anti-gravitational effect of the dancer &quot;en pointe&quot;. On the contrary, the platform displays weightiness more like the flat steps of modern dance.

In the 1950s, platform shoes were not favored in the same way that they used to be. Fashion returned to the more elegantly shaped shoe.

===== 1960s and 1970s =====
A resurgence of interest in platform shoes in fashion began as early as 1967 (appearing in both advertisements and articles in 1970 issues of &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine), and continued through to 1976 in Europe and Britain, when they suddenly went out of fashion. The fad lasted even further in the US, lasting until as late as the early 1980s. At the beginning of the fad, they were worn primarily by young women in their teens and twenties, and occasionally by younger girls, older women, and (particularly during the disco era) by young men. Platform shoes were considered the &quot;party shoe.&quot; Disco-goers used their shoes to bring attention to themselves on the dance floor. 70s platform shoes were presented in dramatic and showy ways such as with glitter or tiny lights.

In 1972, at 219 Bowery in Manhattan, Carole Basetta developed a special mold for making platform shoes and was successful in selling custom-made shoes to people such as David Bowie, David Johansen of the New York Dolls, and several other punk artists. Although platform shoes did provide added height without the discomfort of spike heels, they seem to have been worn primarily for the sake of attracting attention. Many glam rock musicians wore platform shoes as part of their act. Bowie, an icon of glam rock and androgynous fashion in the 1970s, famously wore platform shoes while performing as his alter ego Ziggy Stardust.

While a wide variety of styles were popular during this period, including boots, espadrilles, oxfords, sneakers, and sandals of all description, with soles made of wood, cork, or synthetic materials, the most popular style of the late 1960s and early 1970s was a simple quarter-strap sandal with tan water buffalo-hide straps, on a beige suede-wrapped cork wedge-heel platform sole. These were originally introduced under the brand name Kork-Ease but the extreme popularity supported many imitators. Remarkably, there was very little variation in style, and most of that variation was limited to differences in height.

===== 1980s =====
As the fad progressed, manufacturers like Candie&#x27;s stretched the envelope of what was considered too outrageous to wear, while others, like Famolare and Cherokee of California, introduced &quot;comfort&quot; platforms, designed to combine the added height of platforms with the support and comfort of sneakers, or even orthopedic shoes, and by the time the fad finally fizzled in the late 1980s, girls and women of all ages were wearing them. It may also be a by-product of this fad that Scandinavian clogs, which were considered rather outrageous in the late 1960s and early 1970s, had become classic by the 1980s.

===== 1990s =====
Vivienne Westwood, the UK fashion designer, re-introduced the high heeled platform shoe into high fashion in the early 1990s; it was while wearing a pair of Super-Elevated Gillie with five-inch platforms and nine-inch heels that the supermodel Naomi Campbell fell on the catwalk at a fashion show. However, they did not catch on quickly and platform shoes only began to resurface in mainstream fashion in the late 1990s, thanks in part to the UK singing group the Spice Girls. The all-girl group was often seen in tall platform sneakers and boots. The footwear brand Buffalo created the famous platform sneakers worn by members of the group.

The United Kingdom (and European) experience of platform shoes was somewhat different from that of the United States. The long, pointed shoes of the early 2000s, giving an elongated look to the foot, have been more popular in the US than in the UK.

====21st century====
===== 2000s =====
The platform shoe resurfaced in popularity in the early 2000s when the YSL Tribute Sandal appeared in 2004, quickly gaining popularity by celebrities and the fashion world for its sex appeal and added comfort of a platform sole. The shoe is continued to be released season after season, despite changes in creative directors.

===== 2010s =====
During the late 2010s, platform boots became fashionable due to a resurgence of interest in 1970s fashion. These included so-called &quot;nothing shoes&quot; with clear Perspex soles, and mule sandals.

<doc id="699698" wikidata="Q711884" url="?curid=699698" title="Matt Barlow">
<text>Matthew Barlow (born March 10, 1971) is an American heavy metal singer. He is the lead singer for Ashes of Ares and former lead singer of Iced Earth and Pyramaze. He is Jon Schaffer&#x27;s brother-in-law.

==History==
Barlow joined Iced Earth after the &quot;Night of the Stormrider&quot; tour with Blind Guardian in Europe, as a replacement for John Greely. The first album Barlow can be heard on is &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; (1995). Barlow left the band in 2003, much to the chagrin of many fans. His reason for leaving was due to personal beliefs related to the September 11 terrorist attacks. He took a look at his life and realized that he wanted to contribute to the &quot;real world&quot; instead of living the illusion of a &quot;rock star.&quot; He approached Jon Schaffer with this in late 2002, but Schaffer, known for his persuasive personality, convinced Barlow to stay with the band. When the band recorded &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot;, Schaffer decided that Barlow&#x27;s vocals were not what he desired them to be; he believed they lacked the passion and quality that Barlow was known for. He decided to let Barlow go after all and hired Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, former lead singer of Judas Priest.

Barlow became a police officer in the police department in Georgetown, Delaware. He was also a vocalist for the First State Force Band, which is made up of law enforcement members from different departments throughout Delaware. The band performs for schools, aiming to promote positive values through music.

On April 13, 2007, Barlow returned to music more fully as the new lead singer of Danish progressive power metal band Pyramaze. Barlow accepted the offer to join Pyramaze because it would allow him to return to the music scene, while still being able maintain his current job.

However, on December 11, 2007, it was announced that Barlow had officially re-joined Iced Earth and would be singing on &quot;The Crucible of Man&quot; and following albums. Pyramaze confirmed that he would remain with them to record their album &quot;Immortal&quot;, but that their professional relationship would end there.

On March 3, 2011, Matt Barlow announced that he will again be leaving Iced Earth after the band finishes its European festival shows, citing his commitment to his family and the need for Iced Earth to tour more as his reasons for retirement. On August 6, Barlow performed his farewell show with Iced Earth at the Wacken Open Air festival.

On June 26, 2012, Barlow announced on his Facebook page the creation of a new band named Ashes of Ares with former Iced Earth bassist Freddie Vidales and Nevermore drummer Van Williams, posting on YouTube two one-minute teaser videos. The band signed with Nuclear Blast, and the self-titled album released on September 6, 2013.

In May 2013, Barlow contributed vocals to American power metal band Artizan&#x27;s album &quot;Ancestral Energy&quot;, being featured on the album&#x27;s final track.

On January 1, 2017, a joint project with Jonah Weingarten of Pyramaze named We Are Sentinels was announced by Barlow on his Facebook page.

<doc id="699699" wikidata="Q936877" url="?curid=699699" title="Edwards Pierrepont">
<text>Edwards Pierrepont (March 4, 1817 – March 6, 1892) was an American attorney, reformer, jurist, traveler, New York U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney General, U.S. Minister to England, and orator. Having graduated from Yale in 1837, Pierrepont studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1840. During the American Civil War, Pierrepont was a Democrat, although he supported President Abraham Lincoln. Pierrepont initially supported President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s conservative Reconstruction efforts having opposed the Radical Republicans. In both 1868 and 1872, Pierrepont supported Ulysses S. Grant for president. For his support, President Grant appointed Pierrepont United States Attorney in 1869. In 1871, Pierrepont gained the reputation as a solid reformer, having joined New York&#x27;s &quot;Committee of Seventy&quot; that shut down Boss Tweed&#x27;s corrupt Tammany Hall. In 1872, Pierrepont modified his views on Reconstruction and stated that African American freedman&#x27;s rights needed to be protected.

In April 1875, Pierrepont was appointed U.S. Attorney General by President Grant, who, having teamed up with Secretary of Treasury Benjamin Bristow, vigorously prosecuted the notorious Whiskey Ring, a national tax evasion swindle that involved whiskey distillers, brokers, and government officials, including President Grant&#x27;s private secretary, Orville E. Babcock. Upon his appointment, Pierrepont quickly cleaned up corruption in Southern U.S. districts. Pierrepont had continued former Attorney General George H. Williams moratorium on prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan had been previously prosecuted by President Grant&#x27;s Attorneys General Amos T. Akerman and Williams from 1871 to 1873, prosecuting civil rights violations of whites against African Americans. Pierrepont ruled that a naturalized Prussian immigrant&#x27;s son born in the U.S. was not obligated to serve in the Prussian military as an adult. In his ruling of the Chorpenning Claim, Pierrepont cited the Supreme Court case &quot;Gorden v United States&quot;, having agreed that the Postmaster General, as well as the Secretary of War, served as ministers rather than legally binding arbitrators for a monetary claim by a private citizen. After serving as Attorney General, Pierrepont was appointed Minister to Great Britain by President Grant serving from 1876 to 1877. After many visits to France, Pierrepont became an advocate for bimetalism. Having returned from England, Pierrepont resumed his law practice until his death in 1892.

==Early life and ancestry==

Edwards Pierrepont was born in North Haven, Connecticut, on March 4, 1817. He was the son of Giles Pierepont and Eunice Munson Pierepont. Giles Pierepont was a New England descendant of James Pierepont, a cofounder of Yale University. Pierrepont&#x27;s baptised name was Munson Edwards Pierepont, however, he changed his name to Edwards Pierrepont, dropping Munson and adding an extra &quot;r&quot; to his last name. Pierrepont was an earlier version of his family name.

Pierrepont attend several schools in the North Haven area, enrolled at Yale University, and graduated in 1837. After graduation, Edwards traveled and explored the West, then studied at New Haven Law School. He passed the bar in 1840, and tutored at Yale University from 1840 to 1841. He then moved to Columbus, Ohio where he practiced law with Phineas B. Wilcox from 1840 to 1845. In 1846, Pierrepont moved to New York where he established his own practice.

==Marriage, family, and estates==

On May 27, 1846, Pierrepont married Margaretta Willoughby, from Brooklyn, the daughter of Samuel Willoughby. Their marriage produced two children, one son, Edwin, and one daughter, Margaretta. Edwin died in Rome in 1885 while serving as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires, having replaced Mr. William Astor, the U.S. Envoy, who had retired. Pierrepont&#x27;s daughter married Leanord F. Beckwith who lived at 48 West Seventy-second Street in New York.

In 1852, Pierrepont completed the construction of his estate house at 103 Fifth Avenue in New York. This would be his permanent residence for the next 40 years. In 1867, Pierrepont built a country estate house in Garrison, designed by architect Alexander Jackson Davis; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as the Hurst-Pierrepont Estate.

==Political career==
Upon moving to New York, Pierrepont became active in politics, having joined the Democratic Party in 1846. Pierrepont first served in office when he was elected Superior Court Judge on the New York Supreme Court; he served from 1857 to 1860.

==Civil War==
Pierrepont was believed to have a pulse on the nation and served as Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s personal advisor before and after Lincoln was elected president. In 1862, during the Civil War Pierrepont was appointed by President Lincoln a member of the military commission to try the cases of state prisoners in the custody of the federal military authorities. During the Presidential election of 1864, Pierrepont supported Lincoln in a political speech at Cooper Union, believing President Lincoln would secure the restoration of the Union. Pierrepont stated Lincoln stood for freedom, liberty and national glory.

==Prosecuted Surratt trial==
In 1867 Pierrepont conducted the case for the government against John H. Surratt, indicted as an accomplice in the murder of President Lincoln. Surratt, a former Confederate spy, was the last person to be tried by a U.S. Military commission in the case of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination. After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Surratt fled the United States to Montreal, Liverpool, Rome, and was finally caught in Egypt on December 2, 1866, where he was indicted and returned to the United States to face U.S. military trial. The trial opened on June 10, 1867 under Judge George P. Fisher and held immense public interest in the United States. Pierrepont argued that Surratt was involved in the conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. Government and involved with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth. Pierrepont argued that the military trial was suited for Surratt&#x27;s case and quoted Bible verses that he viewed supported government was created by God for the express purpose of finding the guilty. Pierrepont argued that because Surratt had assumed an alias name, John Harrison, in staying at a hotel, and had fled the country that this proved his guilt. The trial lasted until August 10, 1867 and ended with the jury unable to make any decision after a seventy-hour deliberation. As a result of the hung jury, Judge Fisher set Surratt free.

==New York constitutional convention member==

In April 1867, Pierrepont was elected a member of the New York Constitutional Convention serving on the Judiciary Committee. A total of 19 committees were created to study each constitutional revision with Pierrepont&#x27;s larger Judiciary Committee having a total of 15 members. The Constitutional Convention turned out to be a long drawn-out process of deliberation that lasted into June 1867 whose purpose was to root out any constitutional defects from the previous 1846 New York Constitution. One contentious issue was whether to allow women suffrage and to strike out the word &quot;male&quot; that defined New York voters.

==U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York==
From April 25, 1869 to July 20, 1870 Pierrepont served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant. As U.S. Attorney, he prosecuted Cuban revolutionaries for violation of the Neutrality Act. On Tuesday June 15, 1869, U.S. Attorney Pierrepont arrested and indicted members of the &quot;Cuban Junta&quot;, an organization to aid the Cuban Rebellion. Included in the arrests were the &quot;Cuban Junta&quot; President and other members; Jose Moralez Lemus, Wm. O.C. Ryan, Francisco Fesser, and Jose Mora. The &quot;Cuban Junta&quot; on May 1, 1869 had organized a military expedition to fight in the Cuban Rebellion against Spain. Other members of the &quot;Cuban Junta&quot; escaped arrest by the Deputy Marshall Allan. Pierrepont retired as U.S. Attorney and resumed his private law practice.

==Committee of Seventy member==

After the American Civil War the Democratic Party under Boss William Tweed&#x27;s Tammany Hall gained a monopoly in both New York City Hall and the New York Legislature. Allegations of corruption rapidly grew as rumors spread that Boss Tweed and associates of Tammany Hall were laundering tax payers money in real estate and bribing New York State legislatures for favorable legislation. New York City workers under the Tammany Hall system were paid excessive rates on the burden of tax payers. By 1871, New York City residents and the press demanded that the corruption be investigated and cleaned up. On September 4, at Cooper Union, a large organization of reputed citizens was formed known as the &quot;Committee of Seventy&quot;, that investigated the corruption of Boss Tweed&#x27;s Tammany Hall Ring. Pierrepont was appointed to and actively served on the legislation commission of the &quot;Committee of Seventy&quot;. The &quot;Committee of Seventy&quot; promised to thoroughly investigate Tammany Hall corruption and strongly encouraged honest voters to stop taking bribes from Tammany Hall at the polls during election. By the end of October 1871 the &quot;Committee of Seventy&quot; had successfully stopped funding Boss Tweed&#x27;s Tammany Hall by court injunction effectively shutting down the corrupt institution. Tweed was arrested and thrown into jail.

==Supported President Grant ==
On September 25, 1872 reformer Pierrepont gave a speech at the Cooper Union Institute in New York that supported President Grant&#x27;s reelection. Pierrepont stated that Grant&#x27;s opponent Horace Greeley had pointed out that Grant had made a better President than expected and that his second term would be better than his first. Pierrepont stated that President Grant had been unjustly slandered by the press, and that he believed &quot;security, confidence, development and unexampled prosperity&quot; would take place during President Grant&#x27;s second term in office. Pierrepont, who had toured the South in February, spoke on President Grant&#x27;s Reconstruction policy. Pierrepont had observed that southern whites in poverty supported Greeley, while African Americans were loyal to President Grant. Although acknowledging Reconstruction state governments needed reform, Pierrepont blamed southern poverty on the Southern peoples &quot;swollen pride and obstinate will&quot;. Pierrepont believed that Grant&#x27;s southern policy was good for the Southern people; that African Americans needed to be protected in their rights; and that government needed to govern justly and generously. Pierrepont believed that electing Greeley would turn over the state governments to a rebellious people and reminded his audience of Union prisoner deaths that had taken place at Andersonville and harsh conditions at Libby Prison. As a reformer, Pierrepont stated he would do his best to ensure that honest men were placed around President Grant.

On October 11, 1872 Edwards Pierrepont spoke in Ithaca, New York supporting President Grant and the Republican ticket. Pierrepont related a story of President Grant unworried he would not win North Carolina. Although there was concern that Grant would not win North Carolina, Pierrepont stated that Grant had said to a friend when wolves howl at night the sound is greater than the actual number of wolves. According to President Grant, this was the case in North Carolina. Pierrepont predicted Grant would win New York for seven reasons including that Grant had already won the state in 1868 when the Democratic coalition was at its height, the Republicans had carried the state government, and that Grant would receive 17,000 votes from African Americans. Pierrepont stated the Tammany Ring would no longer be instrumental in securing the Democratic vote through fraud. Pierrepont had earlier been instrumental in prosecuting the Tammany Ring that was completely shut down. With the prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan by President Grant and Pierrepont&#x27;s shutting down the Tammany Ring, the general election of 1872 was one of the most fair in United States history.

==Saint-Gaudens bust==
In 1874, Pierrepont hired a young and upcoming Irish born sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens to create a marble bust of himself. Pierrepont, who practiced phrenology, believed that having a wide head was a sign of intelligence. Pierrepont was an admirer of Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle and he wanted his head to be wide as theirs were. Pierrepont turned out to be a demanding patron as he insisted Saint-Gaudens make his head larger on the bust. Although Saint-Gaudens complied, he was upset at Pierrepont for having to make his head larger. Saint-Gaudens said that Pierrepont&#x27;s bust &quot;seemed to be affected with some dreadful swelling disease&quot;. Saint-Gaudens was so upset over the Pierrepont portrait sculpture that he later stated to a friend, David Armstrong, he would &quot;give anything to get hold of that bust and smash it to atoms&quot;.

==U.S. Attorney General==
President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Pierrepont Attorney General of the United States on April 26, 1875. A former Democrat, Pierrepont had difficulty fitting into the Grant Administration, as stress was created during his tenure because of the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring and the indictment of Grant&#x27;s private secretary, American Civil War general, Orville E. Babcock. Pierrepont, a reformer, was teamed up by President Grant with Secretary of Treasury, Benjamin Bristow to rid the government of corruption. Sec. Bristow had discovered whiskey distillers had created a government ring that profiteered by evading payment of taxes on the manufacturing of whiskey. Pierrepont was also involved with Reconstruction, as President Grant administered Southern policy through the Attorney General&#x27;s Justice Department and the War Department. In terms of southern Reconstruction, Pierrepont continued his predecessor Att. Gen. George H. Williams&#x27;s Spring, 1873 moratorium of prosecuting civil rights cases and in general was unresponsive to white violent attacks or outrages against African American citizens in the South. Pierrepont was more concerned for the restoration of the United States &quot;international influence and political clout&quot; after the American Civil War and was primarily known for his rulings on international law, naturalization, and extradition. To change his Cabinet coalition, President Grant removed Pierrepont as Attorney General and appointed him minister to Great Britain.

=== Reforms (1875)===
When Pierrepont assumed the office of U.S. Attorney General, he immediately implemented overdue reform in the South&#x27;s U.S. Marshal and U.S. Attorney departments. The culmination of these reforms took place in June 1875. Attorney General Pierrepont had given specific reform orders to U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals in the South that were vigorously enforced. Pierrepont ran extensive investigations into the conduct of the U.S. Attorneys and U.S. Marshals, exposing fraud and corruption. Pierrepont was fully sustained by President Grant&#x27;s endorsement of the investigations, reforms, and persons to be removed and replaced from office.

===Naturalization (1875)===
In July 1875 Attorney General Pierrepont ruled on the naturalization case of the son of a Prussian immigrant, Steinkoanler, who had immigrated to the United States in 1848. Steinkoanler was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1854. Steinkoanler returned to Prussia with his son, born in the United States, who was four years old. The naturalization case concerned whether Steinkoanler&#x27;s son, who was then 20 years old, had to serve in the Prussian military, an obligation for all Prussian male children. Pierrepont ruled that Steinkoanler&#x27;s son, had both United States and Prussian citizenship, and was only obligated to serve in the Prussian military while under his father&#x27;s care. However, after Steinkoanler had come of age on his own, he was free to return to the United States and as a U.S. citizen could even run for the President of the United States.

===Chorpenning claim (1875)===
On July 25, 1875, Attorney General Pierrepont ruled on what was denounced as a fraud known as the Chorpenning claim. Chorpenning had petitioned the post office in 1857 for payment of mail delivery in San Pedro and Carson&#x27;s Valley. Chorpenning was paid $109,072.95 by Postmaster General Aaron V. Brown in 1857 for his postal services, however Chorpening, under protest, believed he deserved more compensation. On July 15, 1870, Congress authorized the Postmaster General to adjust the Chorpenning claim. On December 23, 1870, Grant&#x27;s Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell ruled that Chorpenning was owed a $443,010.60 adjustment. On January 12, 1871 a House committee suspended payment to Chorpenning. On February 9, 1871 Congress repealed the July 15, 1870 law that allowed the Postmaster General to adjust the Chorpenning claim. On March 3, 1871 Congress forbid that any appropriations go to pay the Chorpenning claim. On May 8, 1872 Congress again forbid any appropriations to pay for the Chorpening claim. Pierrepont ruled that Postmaster General Creswell was not an arbitrator between Chorpenning and Congress. Chorpenning&#x27;s legal counsel argued that Congress was bound to pay any contracts between Congress and a private citizen. Pierrepont argued citing &quot;Gordon v United States&quot; that the Postmaster served as in a ministerial position rather than judicial, and therefore Creswell&#x27;s adjustment was not binding. Pierrepont referred the Chorpening claim to the Court of Collections and allowed the next Congress to decide the fate of the Chorpening claim, unless the statute of limitations stopped the claim.

=== Mississippi (1875) ===
President Grant&#x27;s Reconstruction policy worked through the U.S. Attorney General and the Justice Department, in addition to the Secretary of War and the War Department. During later Reconstruction white supremacists known as &quot;white liners&quot; in both the North and the South put pressure on the Grant Administration to limit the use of deployed troops in the South that protected African American citizens under the Reconstruction Act of 1867. Previously President Grant had destroyed the Ku Klux Klan under the Enforcement Acts in 1871. Resistance continued and resurged as white liners violently attacked Mississippi blacks in 1875. Republican Governor Adelbert Ames requested troops to protect black voters. In order to avoid violence, Attorney General Pierrepont sent George K. Chase to Mississippi who met with white liner leaders to hold them to their previous pledge not to use violence during the election. President Grant and Att. Gen. Pierrepont told Governor Ames to use federal troops only if the white liners used violence on election day. No violence took place on election day, however, the intimidation tactics of the white liners prior to the election kept blacks and Republican voters from the polls.

===Whiskey Ring (1875–1876) ===

After the American Civil War, whiskey distillers in St. Louis developed a tax evasion ring that depleted the U.S. Treasury. By 1875, the Whiskey Ring had grown into a nationwide criminal syndicate that included whiskey distillers, brokers, and government officials; making enormous profits from the sale of untaxed whiskey. Also rumored, was that in 1872 the Ring had secretly funded the Republican Presidential campaign. In an effort of reform and to clean up corruption, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Benjamin Bristow, as U.S. Secretary of Treasury in 1874, who immediately discovered millions of dollars were being depleted from the U.S. Treasury. Under orders from President Grant, in May 1875, Sec. Bristow struck hard at the Ring, nationally shutting down distilleries, arresting hundreds involved in the ring having obtained over 350 indictments. The Ring through Bristow&#x27;s vigorous raids had been effectively shut down. In April 1875, President Grant appointed Pierrepont Attorney General and teamed him up with Bristow to prosecute the Ring and clean up corruption. Pierrepont and the Justice Department created by Grant prosecuted the Whiskey Ring. Under orders from Grant, Pierrepont controversially sent circular letters to district attorneys in Milwaukee, Chicago, and St. Louis denying immunity to offenders who would testify against the ring. Pierrepont&#x27;s prosecution of the ring however was viewed satisfactory by the public. 

During the Summer of 1875, both Bristow and Pierrepont obtained President Grant&#x27;s order to &quot;let know guilty man escape&quot;. During the Fall of 1875, evidence was discovered that Grant&#x27;s private secretary, Orville Babcock had been involved in the Ring. Bristow and Pierrepont, stayed behind after a cabinet meeting with President Grant and showed him correspondence between Babcock and William Joyce in St. Louis, indicted in the Ring, cryptic telegram messages as evidence of Babcock&#x27;s involvement in the Ring. Babcock was summoned to the Oval Office for an explanation and was told to send a telegram to bring Wilson to Washington, D.C. After Babcock did not return to the Oval Office, Pierrepont discovered Babcock was in the process of writing a letter warning Wilson to be on his guard. This angered Attorney General Pierrepont, who spilled ink over Babcock&#x27;s letter and shouted, &quot;You don&#x27;t want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. I do not understand it.&quot; Babcock was indicted and later acquitted in a trial in St. Louis, after an oral deposition from President Grant defending Babcock was given to the jury. The Justice Department obtained 110 convictions of persons involved in the Whiskey Ring.

In March 1876, a rumor spread throughout Washington, D.C., that Attorney General Pierrepont had given information to aid the defense counsel of Orville Babcock in St. Louis. Pierrepont publicly denied the allegation in a letter to Scott Lord and stated the rumor was &quot;an infamous falsehood&quot;. Pierrepont suspected that Gen. Babcock himself was the source of the rumor. Babcock was dismissed as Grant&#x27;s personal secretary after Babcock&#x27;s acquittal in St. Louis. Pierrepont also denied the rumor that himself and Secretary Bristow were at odds with each other. Pierrepont produced a letter from October 1875 to Bluford Wilson, Bristow&#x27;s assistant during the Whiskey Ring raids, that proved Bristow and Pierrepont were working together in harmony during the Whiskey Ring prosecutions.

==U.S. Minister to Britain==

On May 22, 1876 President Grant appointed Pierrepont Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to Britain, having replaced Robert Schenck, serving until December 1, 1877. While serving as minister to Britain, Pierrepont became interested in bimetalism, frequently traveling to France, a bimetalist country.

On June 5, 1877 Pierrepont gave a reception for former President Ulysses S. Grant at his elaborate house on Cavendish Square. The Prince of Wales Edward Albert, Foreign Secretary Lord Derby Edward Stanley, William Gladstone and his wife Catherine, and American journalist Kate Field attended the formal affair. Although Grant was well received by the British public, a diplomatic controversy was caused when British officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli told Pierrepont that as a former head of state, Grant was nothing more than a &quot;commoner&quot;, and could not be recognized by the government. Lord Derby, minister of foreign affairs, told Pierrepont that since Grant had no formal rank in the United States, he had none in Britain. Pierrepont countered Derby saying that first Napoleon had been elected ruler, not by hereditary lineage, and yet the succeeding Bonaparte emperors were recognized by England: &quot;Once an Emperor always an Emperor.&quot; Therefore, the same precedent applied to an elected head of state: &quot;Once a President always a President.&quot; Grant&#x27;s diplomatic recognition, although informal, came when Queen Victoria invited him to Windsor Castle. The Grants accepted, and on June 26, 1877 Pierrepont introduced the former president to the Queen. She received them in an appropriate setting, the castle&#x27;s magnificent 520 feet quadrangle.

After his tenure as Minister Plenipotentiary ended, Pierrepont returned to the United States and resumed his private legal practice in New York.

==Retirement==
===Transcontinental trip to Alaska===

In 1883, at the age of 66, Pierrepont and his son Edwin Willoughby Pierrepont took a transcontinental trip to the far reaches of Alaska starting from New York. On July 25 Pierrepont and Edwin visited Fort Wrangell, having sailed by ship into Wrangell Harbor. Edwin was impressed by the mirror reflection of the snow-capped mountains in the harbor waters. Upon their return, Pierrepont and Edwin published a widespread paper titled, &quot;Fifth Avenue to Alaska&quot; in 1884. Edwin was awarded a fellowship to the Royal Geographical Society of England. The long trip took a health toll on him and he died in 1885.

===Visited Atlanta===

On August 28, 1886, Pierrepont and his wife visited Atlanta, Georgia, staying at the Kimball House. The year before Pierrepont had submitted a letter published by &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; on bimetalism, a topic of popular discussion during the 1880s. Pierrepont favored a bimetalist economy believing that having two metal currencies would alleviate poverty and would keep a few wealthy businessmen from monopolizing a single gold standard currency. While in Atlanta, Pierrepont stated that the relations between the North and the South had improved and that the Southerners bore no ill will to the North. Pierrepont believed Atlanta was a model city for Southern industrialization. The Pierreponts toured the South in search of a place to improve Margaretta&#x27;s health condition. Mrs. Pierrepont had suffered from grief after the death of their son Edwin, who had died of a fever in Rome in 1885.

==Illness, death, and funeral==

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in late 1889, Pierrepont suffered a nervous disease that &quot;deprived him of the use of his limbs&quot;. Although Pierrepont was an invalid, for the next two and one-half years he was able to carry on most of his law practice and travel back and forth from his New York residence to his mansion in Garrison. On Wednesday, March 2, 1892, Pierrepont suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body and he lost the ability to speak. Four days later on March 6, Pierrepont died in the house in New York he had built 40 years earlier.

The funeral services were done by Rev. Dr. Henry Y. Satterlee at Calvary Church on Wednesday March 9, at 10 am. Pierrepont&#x27;s body was transferred to Garrison where he was buried at St. Philip&#x27;s Cemetery, accompanied by 10 prominent pallbearers.

==Legacy==
Pierrepont is primarily known for his success as an attorney appearing for well-known clients in important cases, and for fighting political corruption in federal, state, and city offices. This includes his successful prosecution and shutting down the Whiskey Ring, a national tax evasion syndicate, from 1875 to 1876. Politically, Pierrepont&#x27;s success relied mainly on his appointments to office by President Ulysses S. Grant to U.S. Attorney for New York, U.S. Attorney General, and U.S. Minister to Great Britain. Pierrepont is also known for his publications of pamphlets on financial questions, mainly supporting bimetallic standard of U.S. currency. Although Pierrepont&#x27;s tenure as Attorney General took place during Reconstruction, his primary interest at the Justice Department was ruling on cases that determined the rights of U.S. citizens abroad. Certain Supreme Court rulings against the Enforcement Acts signed into law by President Grant, hampered Pierrepont&#x27;s enforcement of civil rights in the United States.

<text>Ghost Rider is the name of multiple superheroes or antiheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Marvel had previously used the name for a Western character whose name was later changed to Phantom Rider.

The first supernatural Ghost Rider is stunt motorcyclist [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], who sold his soul, to save the life of his foster father, agrees to give his soul to &quot;Satan&quot; (later revealed to be an arch-demon named Mephisto). At night and when around evil, Blaze finds his flesh consumed by hellfire, causing his head to become a flaming skull. He rides a fiery motorcycle and wields blasts of hellfire from his body, usually from his hands. He eventually learns he has been bonded with the demon Zarathos. Blaze is featured in the series &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 2) from 1972 to 1983.

The subsequent &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; series (1990–1998) features [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Danny Ketch]] as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by ninja gangsters, Ketch comes in contact with a motorcycle that contains the essence of a Spirit of Vengeance. Blaze reappears in this 1990s series as a supporting character, and it is later revealed that Danny and his sister were Johnny Blaze&#x27;s long-lost siblings. In 2000s comics, Blaze succeeds Ketch, becoming Ghost Rider again. In 2014, [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] becomes Ghost Rider as part of the Marvel NOW! initiative.

In May 2011, Ghost Rider placed 90th on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot; list. Nicolas Cage starred as the Johnny Blaze incarnation of the character in the 2007 film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; and its 2012 sequel, &quot;Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance&quot;. Gabriel Luna and Tom McComas portray the Robbie Reyes and Johnny Blaze incarnations in the fourth season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, with Henry Simmons and Clark Gregg portraying original incarnations [[Alphonso Mackenzie (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Alphonso Mackenzie]] and [[Phil Coulson]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Johnny Blaze===

Following the Western comics character who originally used the name, the first superhero Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, debuted in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; issue #5 (August 1972), created by Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas, writer Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog. He received his own series in 1973, with penciller Jim Mooney handling most of the first nine issues. Several different creative teams mixed-and-matched until penciller Don Perlin began a considerably long stint with issue #26, eventually joined by writer Michael Fleisher through issue #58. The series ran through issue #81 (June 1983). Blaze returned as Ghost Rider in a 2001 six-issue miniseries written by Devin Grayson; a second miniseries written by Garth Ennis in 2005, and an ongoing monthly series that began publication in July 2006. Johnny Blaze was the son of Naomi Blaze and Barton Blaze. Naomi was the previous Ghost Rider.

===Danny Ketch===

The next Ghost Rider, a young man named Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Ketch (Johnny Blaze&#x27;s long-lost younger brother), debuted in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 3) #1 (May 1990). This Ghost Rider was nearly identical to the previous, although his costume was now a black leather biker jacket with spiked shoulder-pads, grey leather pants, and a mystic chain he wore across his chest, which responded to his mental commands and served as his primary melee weapon. His new motorcycle resembled a futuristic machine and the front of it could lower to serve as a battering ram. Like the original Ghost Rider&#x27;s bike, the wheels were composed of mystic hellfire. Unlike the relationship between the previous Ghost Rider and the demon with which he was bonded, Ketch and his demon — who in (vol. 3) #91 (December 1997) is revealed to be Marvel&#x27;s incarnation of the Angel of Death/Judgment — are cooperative with each other. At the close of the series with (vol. 3) #93 (February 1998), Ketch apparently died. The following year, however, &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot; #93 (July 1999) revealed Ketch was still alive. Nearly a decade later, Marvel published the long-completed final issue as &quot;Ghost Rider Finale&quot; (January 2007), which reprints the last issue and the previously unpublished &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 3) #94.

===Alejandra Jones===
During the 2011 storyline &quot;Fear Itself&quot;, a Nicaraguan woman named Alejandra Jones becomes Ghost Rider through a ritual performed by a man named Adam. Though she demonstrates many previously unknown powers of the Ghost Rider entity, she is deprived of its full power when Johnny Blaze takes back most of this power in (vol. 7) #9.
She was killed by Carnage during the Absolute Carnage event.

===Robbie Reyes===

In 2014, a new character took on the &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; mantle: a Mexican-American resident of East Los Angeles named Roberto &quot;Robbie&quot; Reyes, who drives a black classic muscle car reminiscent of a modified 1969 Dodge Charger rather than a motorcycle. Robbie Reyes was created by writer/artist Felipe Smith and designed by Smith and artist Tradd Moore.

===Michael Badilino===
Michael Badilino, an ex-member of the New York City Police Department, is one-third of an &quot;Organic Medallion of Power&quot;; the other two are Ketch and Blaze (the Medallion itself was never explained in any true detail). He possesses powers more in line with those of the Zarathos version of Ghost Rider, although he also possesses the Penance Stare and his motorcycle seemed to share characteristics with the Noble Kale version. His appearance is distinguished by a deep purple skull, large fangs protruding from his upper jaw, and backswept curved horns on the top of his skull.

In his superhuman form, Badilino was called Vengeance, and originally attempted to kill the Ghost Rider, believing him to be Zarathos. Vengeance later became the ally of Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze. Vengeance also took on the role of the Ghost Rider and even semi-seriously referred to himself by that name when confronted by Spider-Man shortly after the apparent death of Ghost Rider in battle with Zarathos and acolytes The Fallen. Vengeance killed himself, along with the villain Hellgate, by triggering a massive explosion through his Hellfire, the source of the mystical flames that encompass the bones of both Vengeance and Ghost Rider.

Vengeance reappears in the last four issues of &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 3), involved in Blackheart&#x27;s plans to kill Noble Kale. Vengeance aids the Ghost Rider in the ensuing battle, destroying Blackheart and ruling Hell during Ketch&#x27;s absences.
* An &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; incarnation of Vengeance exists as former biker turned Vice President of the United States Robert Blackthorne and was featured as a villain in &quot;Ultimate Avengers&quot;.

===Kushala===
In the 19th century, while her tribe was being attacked by the U.S. Army, Kushala&#x27;s parents were killed and, in an act of rage, she prayed to her creator, but instead was possessed by a Spirit of Vengeance. Then she burnt everyone until all that remained were their spirits. After becoming possessed by the Spirit of Vengeance, Kushala traveled the world seeking out and studying different forms of magic in an attempt to cure herself. Her skills in the mystic arts eventually led to her becoming the Sorcerer Supreme of her era.

==Powers and abilities==
The Ghost Rider is a human who can transform into a skeletal superhuman wreathed in ethereal flame and given supernatural powers. The abnormal motorcycle he rides can travel faster than any conventional vehicle and perform impossible feats such as riding up a vertical surface, across water, and leaping across great distances that normal motorcycles cannot. The Ghost Riders are virtually indestructible and notoriously hard to injure by any conventional means, as bullets and knives usually pass through them without causing pain (knives are shown to melt while in their body). It is possible that they are genuinely immortal, as it is said that God created them and only God can destroy them. Despite being composed of bone and hellfire, the Ghost Riders possess formidable superhuman strength, enough to easily pick up a truck and hurl it across a road. It has been stated that Johnny Blaze as Ghost Rider can bench press around 25 tons (50,000 lbs) (or more as seen in World War Hulk). Each Ghost Rider entity also had abilities specific to him or her.

;Johnny Blaze: Originally when Blaze transformed into Ghost Rider, his body changed but not the clothes he was wearing. In his new incarnation, this is different and his clothes take on a different appearance with a spiked leather jacket and chains. As Ghost Rider, he can cause his motorcycle to transform and surround itself with hellfire or he can create a new cycle from pure hellfire. He is also capable of projecting hellfire as a weapon. His hellfire &quot;burns the soul&quot; without leaving physical injuries on the victim and its effects have been seen as similar to the &quot;Penance Stare.&quot; In his new incarnation, Blaze is now possibly the most powerful hero on Earth. During &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, Doctor Strange said Ghost Rider might be as powerful as the &quot;Green Scar&quot; persona of Hulk and could possibly defeat him. During this series, Doctor Strange also states that Ghost Rider protects only the innocent, which none of the Illuminati are. In recent comics, Blaze&#x27;s Ghost Rider has been given the &quot;Penance Stare&quot; and mystical chain, both of which were specific to the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider. Blaze also uses a shotgun and discovered that he can discharge hellfire from the weapon when he first encountered Ketch. Now, he also has new abilities including hellfire breath, the ability to produce chains from either his throat or chest, and the ability to travel between incorporeal realms.

;Danny Ketch: When Ketch transformed into Ghost Rider, his clothes changed with him, taking on the appearance of a spiked leather jacket with chains with a collar, gray leather pants, and spiked gloves and boots. Likewise, his motorcycle underwent a radical transformation, changing from a conventional one into a high-tech motorcycle (this transformation was not strictly limited to the motorcycle he was found in the cemetery with as he was once seen able to transform another cycle in &quot;Ghost Rider/Wolverine/Punisher: Hearts of Darkness&quot;). Along with flaming wheels that allow the bike to nearly fly across surfaces, the bike included a shield-like battering ram on the front. As the Ghost Rider, Ketch used a mystical chain which responded to his mental commands. It could grow in length, alter direction while in the air, stiffen into a staff or spear, and separate into several links which can strike like shrapnel and then return to their original form. Daniel&#x27;s most famous power was the &quot;Penance Stare.&quot; By locking eyes with a target and mentally focusing, the Danny Ketch Ghost Rider was able to make the target experience all the pain they had ever inflicted on anyone else. However, some beings have shown resistance to this ability, such as Venom and Carnage as their alien symbiote &quot;costumes&quot; do not technically have eyes; and Madcap, who is so masochistic, he claims to enjoy the experience. In the 1994 Fantastic Four animated series, this ability was shown to be powerful enough to bring down the mighty Galactus, as Ghost Rider forced Galactus to feel the pain of all those who had died as a result of his feeding on their planets; as Ghost Rider put it, &quot;A billion souls&quot;. This display of power, though, appeared to simply be a rewrite for the animated series, as the original storyline in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; issue 243 has Doctor Strange casting a spell that causes all of the souls of those Galactus had killed by his feedings to be visited upon him at once. Originally, this incarnation of the Ghost Rider could only be summoned if Danny was present when &quot;innocent blood was spilled&quot; (an innocent simply being threatened was not enough), at which time Danny had to touch the gas cap of his motorcycle for the transformation process to occur. Later, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider without touching the gas cap but still needed to wait for innocent blood to be spilled. Later still, he was able to summon the Ghost Rider by willpower alone.

;Robbie Reyes: The ghost of Eli Morrow that inhabits Robbie&#x27;s body is not, according to Johnny Blaze, a true Spirit of Vengeance. Regardless, he gives Robbie several abilities similar to that of other Ghost Riders, including the power to manifest and control chains ending in thin knives or sickles. The black muscle car that Morrow&#x27;s ghost initially inhabits is linked to Robbie&#x27;s Ghost Rider form, allowing him to instantly teleport to and/or merge with the car. The car can also be driven remotely, and Robbie&#x27;s Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car&#x27;s trunk, when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location. Though it is initially unknown if Robbie&#x27;s Ghost Rider form possesses the divine powers of his predecessors, he eventually displays the ability to use the Penance Stare during a battle with Star Brand. Eli is able to take full control of Robbie&#x27;s body when the teen gives in to his negative emotions, signified by a pallid skin tone and both of his eyes turning orange. His Ghost Rider form also displays the ability to change into a more powerful and demonic form when Robbie is sufficiently angered. At the end of the fourth season of &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, to prevent the &quot;Darkhold&quot; from being used again, he slung his flaming chains in the same manner as a Sling Ring, allowing him to travel and take the book with him for safekeeping.

==Other Spirits of Vengeance==
===Naomi Kale===
Naomi Kale is the mother of Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, and Barbara Ketch.

===Noble Kale===
Noble lived in the 18th century and grew up with his abusive father Pastor Kale and his younger brother Dante.

Noble fell in love with a black girl named Magdelena. But, because of the color of her skin and his father&#x27;s strong religious views, the couple kept their love a secret from the world. They were forced to tell Pastor Kale when Magdelena bore Noble&#x27;s child. Noble and Magdelena were then married.

Shortly after the marriage, Magdelena discovered Pastor Kale&#x27;s dark secret; he was a servant of the dark lord Mephisto. To cover up Magdelena&#x27;s findings, Pastor Kale accused her of witchcraft and had her burned at the stake. Knowing that his son, Noble, would object, he had him drugged, tortured and beaten in the church cellar.

Just before Magdelena died, she used a curse to summon demons that avenge wronged women. The demons were called &quot;Furies&quot; and they started killing the townspeople. Fearing death, Pastor Kale struck a deal with Mephisto. In return for his safety, Mephisto got Noble&#x27;s soul. Mephisto realized that Noble was attached to a piece of the Medallion of Power and he activated the piece to transform Noble into the original &quot;Spirit of Vengeance&quot;. When Ghost Rider had destroyed the Furies, Pastor offered him human flesh - Noble&#x27;s son. Noble, in the guise of Ghost Rider, was unwilling to eat his own child and he killed himself.

When Mephisto later appeared to claim Noble&#x27;s soul, Mephisto&#x27;s brother, the archangel Uriel, appeared and demanded that the soul of Noble Kale be spared. No agreement could be reached, and therefore a compromise was made whereby Noble&#x27;s soul could not be claimed by either realm; but instead, his soul would remain in the void until re-bonded with certain members of his family.

Noble Kale was also established as an ancestor of Jennifer Kale.

===Ghost / The Rider===
Due to the Celestial Progenitor presence influencing human evolution, in 1,000,000 B.C., certain humans became much more intelligent than others as well as able to speak a new language. However, they had to hide that gift from their brethren for fear of being ostracized. One day, a boy that was gifted with the ability to speak is approached by a mysterious stranger that also possessed that gift, only to witness the stranger transform into a beast and devour his entire tribe. The stranger allowed the boy to live and names him &quot;Ghost&quot; before telling him to challenge him when he is worthy. The boy was forced to survive on his own, though he does befriend a woolly mammoth. After almost dying in the harsh environment, he is approached by Mephisto in the form of a snake, who tells him to say its name. Ghost does that and is bonded with a Spirit of Vengeance; after which he imbued his newly acquired hellfire into the mammoth. Other humans had never seen someone ride an animal before and began referring to Ghost as &quot;the Rider&quot;. The Rider continued his search and five years later, eventually caught up with the man who devoured his tribe. The man transformed once more, revealing himself to be the first Wendigo. During the fight, the Rider took the bones of the dead that the Wendigo had killed and used them to form a weapon; the earliest version of the Ghost Rider&#x27;s signature chain. The Rider fought the Wendigo until finally it and the Rider&#x27;s woolly mammoth tumbled over a cliff. Afterwards, Ghost was approached by Odin and Lady Phoenix to join the prehistoric version of the Avengers.

Upon imbuing his hellfire into another woolly mammoth, the Ghost Rider assisted the prehistoric Avengers (consisting of Agamotto, Odin, Lady Phoenix, and prehistoric versions of the Black Panther, Iron Fist, and Star Brand) in fighting an out of control Celestial called the Fallen; which resulted in his woolly mammoth getting killed in action. The Ghost Rider swore revenge and assisted his teammates in defeating the Fallen and sealing it away underground in what would become South Africa. The Ghost Rider later assisted the prehistoric Avengers in fighting the First Host.

===Hellhawk===
During the 11th century, a Native American chieftain from the Sioux nation named Hellhawk sported the powers of the Ghost Rider. He was part of Thor&#x27;s Avengers of 1,000 A.D.

During the 17th century, Hellhawk developed a rivalry with Noble Kane. He was later killed by Narcosis to serve as a warning to Mephisto by Belasco to keep his Spirits of Vengeance out of Limbo.

===The last stand of the Spirits of Vengeance===
Seven riders show their flaming heads for the first time in this story arc by writer Jason Aaron and artist Tan Eng Huat. Daniel Ketch returns with a new mission: to collect the powers of all the Ghost Riders for the angel Zadkiel to prevent the corruption of the powers with their human hosts. Zadkiel has other motives he keeps to himself, for which he needs the powers of the riders to tear down the walls of New Jerusalem and wage war on the heavens.

===Travis Parham===
A version of Ghost Rider appeared in the miniseries &quot;Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears&quot; #1–6 (April–September 2007) by writer Garth Ennis and artist Clayton Crain. Set during the American Civil War, it finds Confederate officer Travis Parham avenging the murders of his friend, an ex-slave named Caleb and Caleb&#x27;s family. Parham meets a horse-riding Ghost Rider who seeks the same men. Eventually, Parham learns about the deaths instrumental in helping set forth the Spirit of Vengeance.

===19th century Ghost Rider===
During the 19th century, an unnamed Ghost Rider was active during the American frontier. He targeted anyone who killed Native American women and children or who cut off their scalps.

===Deputy Kowalski===
Deputy Kowalski was a normal cop in a small town until Ghost Rider rode in one day. It was then that Kowalski was kidnapped by a local cannibal who cut off his hand. Events transpired that led to Kowalski escaping and developing a wrath against the Ghost Rider. His attention was brought to the hellfire shotgun in possession of Badilino. After purchasing the gun—and discovering to Badilino&#x27;s surprise that it will work for Kowalski—Kowalski was recruited by agents of Zadkiel and told to wait in the middle of the desert for the Ghost Rider. Johnny Blaze (as Ghost Rider) did arrive in hot pursuit of Danny Ketch (as a new incarnation of Ghost Rider). Kowalski did manage to get a shot in on Blaze. Although it was a minor setback Blaze resumed his pursuit of Ketch. Left in the desert Kowalski soon found himself transformed into the new Vengeance, sporting green flames and a hook for his right hand, after Ketch returned the powers of the Spirits of Vengeance to Earth.

With a thirst for revenge, Kowalski, as Vengeance, was recruited by Blackout as a member of Zadkiel&#x27;s Ghost Rider Assassination League. Kowalski was partnered with The Orb and was to stop Blaze and Ketch from reaching a monastery which contained a gateway to Heaven. Kowalski was easily defeated by both Ghost Riders and was left as a pet with the monastery&#x27;s Mother Superior.

Vengeance was later freed by the Shadow Council and joins the ninth incarnation of the Masters of Evil.

Willing to give anything to punish Thanos for slaughtering his planet, the Punisher signed a demonic deal with Mephisto and became the Ghost Rider. When he returned to Earth, however, Thanos was already gone and everything on the planet was dead. Roaming endlessly and undying with no one to kill or love, the Ghost Rider spent the next countless years alone. He eventually began to lose his mind when even Mephisto fell silent to his calls. When a badly injured Galactus arrived on Earth seeking help against Thanos, unaware that the population of Earth had already been killed by him, the Ghost Rider offered the dead planet to him in exchange for the chance of punishing the Mad Titan as his herald, which the Devourer of Worlds accepted.

<text>Julia Hartley-Brewer (born 2 May 1968) is a British radio presenter, political journalist, and newspaper columnist. She has hosted a radio show on Talkradio simulcast on Talk called &quot;Julia Hartley-Brewer&quot; on weekdays from 10am.

==Early life and education==
Julia Hartley-Brewer is the daughter of Michael John Hartley-Brewer, who unsuccessfully stood as the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate in Selly Oak in the 1970 general election, and general practitioner Valerie Forbes Hartley-Brewer. Her parents divorced, and her mother trained as a GP while bringing up two children.

Hartley-Brewer was educated at the Oldfield Girls&#x27; Comprehensive School in Bath. Later, Hartley-Brewer studied at Woodhouse Sixth Form College in Finchley, North London. She gained a degree in philosophy, politics and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1988. 

She later studied for a diploma in journalism at Cardiff University&#x27;s School of Journalism.

==Career==
Hartley-Brewer began her career in journalism at the &quot;East London Advertiser&quot; in Bethnal Green, east London. Later, she was employed as a news reporter and political correspondent for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and then joined &quot;The Guardian&quot;, staying at the latter until September 2000. She then moved to the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; as political correspondent, then political editor from 2001 until 2007 and then assistant editor (politics). She left the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; in February 2011.

In 2006, she presented and narrated two political documentaries for the television channels BBC Two and BBC Four about the history of British Deputy Prime Ministers, called &quot;Every Prime Minister Needs a Willie&quot;, and the history of the Leader of the Opposition in &quot;The Worst Job in Politics&quot;.

She was an LBC presenter from February 2011, until she left in December 2014 to be replaced by Shelagh Fogarty.

Hartley-Brewer broadcast on Talkradio, a radio station owned by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corp. She presented the mid-morning weekday show from March 2016 until 15 January 2018, when she moved to host the weekday breakfast show from 6.30am to 10am. 

In September 2019, &quot;The Julia Hartley-Brewer Show&quot; was launched on YouTube under the Talkradio brand; each programme is a one-to-one interview with a guest. The show became a daily simulcast as part of the daily schedule of TalkTV that began broadcasting in April 2022.

In 2022, Hartley-Brewer referred to environmental activist Greta Thunberg&#x27;s autism in a tweet, following Thunberg&#x27;s criticism of internet personality Andrew Tate. The tweet was posted again without mentioning autism. Hartley-Brewer also stated in both the original and re-posted tweet that she would &quot;choose Andrew Tate&#x27;s life *every single time*&quot; over Thunberg&#x27;s. This was widely commented on online when, a day after the tweet, Tate was arrested on suspicion of human trafficking, rape, and forming an organised crime group.

She has written opinion articles and columns for publications such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, and &quot;The Spectator&quot; about politics and current affairs.

===Public appearances===
She has appeared as a panellist on the comedy quiz show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; ten times, as well as being a regular panellist on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions&quot;. She is a regular pundit and commentator on TV and radio, including for Sky News, the BBC News Channel, BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;, ITV&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&quot; show, &quot;Lorraine&quot; on ITV, &quot;This Morning&quot; on ITV, &quot;The Agenda&quot; on ITV, &quot;Sunday Politics&quot; on BBC1, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;PM&quot; programmes.

She was a contestant on &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; in October 2014, winning the prize for her chosen charity. 

==Views==
Hartley-Brewer was a long-standing supporter of Brexit during the campaign in 2016. On 29 March 2019, Hartley-Brewer spoke at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square, London.

She says she is an atheist. In 2010, she described herself as a &quot;staunch and long-standing republican&quot;. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

Discussing the climate crisis, she said that those who believe in an imminent climate catastrophe are &quot;part of a doomsday cult,&quot; and described Extinction Rebellion as &quot;a sort of quasi-religious death cult.&quot; She also stated that climate models &quot;so far have failed to predict anything correctly&quot; and that the science of climate change is &quot;an as-yet unproven theory&quot; and therefore open to challenge, &quot;which is standard practice in science.&quot;

At the Oxford University PPE Society on 20 November 2018, Hartley-Brewer gave a talk on &quot;Political Correctness and Free Speech&quot;, in which she argued that political correctness damaged the ability to freely express political views.

Hartley-Brewer has been referred to as &quot;right-wing&quot; by Nick Duffy writing for &quot;PinkNews&quot;. Duffy reported that on 30 November 2018 Hartley-Brewer threatened to remove a guest from the Talkradio studio where she works as a presenter during a discussion on trans issues because the guest used the term &quot;cis.&quot; A later article in 2021 for &quot;PinkNews&quot; by Lily Wakefield referred to Hartley-Brewer as having &quot;openly voiced her anti-trans views&quot; in reference to the article by Duffy.

The Royal College of General Practitioners invited her to speak in an &quot;NHS Question Time&quot; panel debate at its annual conference in 2019 but withdrew the invitation after over 700 GPs signed a petition complaining that her views were not conducive to the work they were doing to promote inclusivity within the profession and among patients. One of such views involved a deleted Tweet from 2016, in which Hartley-Brewer said &quot;Powell wasn&#x27;t a racist&quot;. On Enoch Powell, she said &quot;I&#x27;m not defending Powell, I just don&#x27;t see anything in the Rivers speech that he got wrong.&quot;.

In April 2021, Ofcom received over 200 complaints accusing Hartley-Brewer of trivialising racism following a TV appearance in which Hartley-Brewer commented on a family portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip taken in 2018, posing with seven of their great-grandchildren, saying &quot;I wonder if Meghan has managed to take offence to this photograph that doesn&#x27;t include her son. Well she probably thinks it&#x27;s a racist photograph, taken before her son was even conceived&quot;. (Prince Archie, the son of Meghan and Prince Harry, was born in 2019).

===Controversies===
In June 2016, Hartley-Brewer said Owen Jones had &quot;more in common with ISIS than he thinks&quot; on Sky News after Jones walked out of an interview on the news channel following host Mark Longhurst&#x27;s refusal to refer to the Orlando nightclub shooting as an assault on LGBT people. Hartley-Brewer also said, &quot;neither the Sky presenter Mark Longhurst nor I said anything that was offensive, wrong or bigoted in any way&quot; and that she would not apologise to Jones. By lunchtime of the following day of the interview and the comments by Hartley-Brewer, Ofcom had received nearly 60 complaints about the programme from viewers who said both Hartley-Brewer and Longhurst were dismissive of Jones&#x27;s argument that the attack was one on the LGBT community.

In October 2017, Hartley-Brewer alleged that the then Defence Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, had repeatedly touched her knee throughout a dinner in 2002; the allegation contributed to his eventual resignation.

On 12 August 2018, she sent a tweet containing a photo of the aftermath of the 1998 Omagh bombing with text saying that Jeremy Corbyn had paid tribute to the victims of the bombing, &quot;including the Real IRA bombers who may have snagged a nail while planting the explosives&quot;. The tweet was criticised as insensitive by Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan was killed by the bomb. He said that while he wouldn&#x27;t have &quot;much faith&quot; in Corbyn, her tweet was &quot;poorly timed&quot;. Writer Lisa McGee and journalist David Blevins criticised the use of the photo. She defended her tweet as satire.

In late 2019, Jolyon Maugham accused Hartley-Brewer of revealing his home address at a time when he was receiving death threats. Hartley-Brewer defended herself by saying Maugham&#x27;s address was already easily available online and that he had previously revealed it himself in published interviews.

On 4 January 2024, during an interview with Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian politician, Hartley yelled at and &quot;repeatedly cut off&quot; Barghouti. She also stated, &quot;Maybe you&#x27;re not used to women talking, I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;d like to finish the sentence!&quot; In response, British Office of Communications (Ofcom) received 17,366 complaints about Hartley&#x27;s conduct during her show, making it the most complained-about United Kingdom program in 2024. 

On 14 April 2024, in the wake of the 2024 Bondi Junction stabbings in Sydney, Australia, before the suspect had been identified, Hartley-Brewer tweeted &quot;Another day. Another terror attack by another Islamic terrorist&quot;. The press later condemned this and other misinformation that had been spread about the attacker, and she deleted her tweet after it had been viewed more than nine million times. The attacker Joel Cauchi was not Muslim.

==Personal life and other activities==
Hartley-Brewer married Rob Walton in 2006. They have one daughter.

<doc id="699706" wikidata="Q786286" url="?curid=699706" title="Sierpiński curve">
<text>Sierpiński curves are a recursively defined sequence of continuous closed plane fractal curves discovered by Wacław Sierpiński, which in the limit formula_1 completely fill the unit square: thus their limit curve, also called the Sierpiński curve, is an example of a space-filling curve.

Because the Sierpiński curve is space-filling, its Hausdorff dimension (in the limit formula_2) is formula_3. 
The Euclidean length of the formula_4th iteration curve formula_5 is
: formula_6

i.e., it grows &quot;exponentially&quot; with formula_7 beyond any limit, whereas the limit for formula_1 of the area enclosed by formula_5 is formula_10 that of the square (in Euclidean metric).

==Uses of the curve==

The Sierpiński curve is useful in several practical applications because it is more symmetrical than other commonly studied space-filling curves. For example, it has been used as a basis for the rapid construction of an approximate solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (which asks for the shortest sequence of a given set of points): The heuristic is simply to visit the points in the same sequence as they appear on the Sierpiński curve. To do this requires two steps: First compute an inverse image of each point to be visited; then sort the values. This idea has been used to build routing systems for commercial vehicles based only on Rolodex card files.

A space-filling curve is a continuous map of the unit interval onto a unit square and so a (pseudo) inverse maps the unit square to the unit interval. One way of constructing a pseudo-inverse is as follows. Let the lower-left corner (0, 0) of the unit square correspond to 0.0 (and 1.0). Then the upper-left corner (0, 1) must correspond to 0.25, the upper-right corner (1, 1) to 0.50, and the lower-right corner (1, 0) to 0.75. The inverse map of interior points are computed by taking advantage of the recursive structure of the curve. 

Here is a function coded in Java that will compute the relative position of any point on the Sierpiński curve (that is, a pseudo-inverse value). It takes as input the coordinates of the point (x,y) to be inverted, and the corners of an enclosing right isosceles triangle (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy). (The unit square is the union of two such triangles.) The remaining parameters specify the level of accuracy to which the inverse should be computed.
 static long sierp_pt2code( double ax, double ay, double bx, double by, double cx, double cy,
 int currentLevel, int maxLevel, long code, double x, double y ) 
 if (currentLevel &lt;= maxLevel) {
 currentLevel++;
 if ((sqr(x-ax) + sqr(y-ay)) &lt; (sqr(x-cx) + sqr(y-cy))) {
 code = sierp_pt2code( ax, ay, (ax+cx)/2.0, (ay+cy)/2.0, bx, by,
 currentLevel, maxLevel, 2 * code + 0, x, y );
 else {
 code = sierp_pt2code( bx, by, (ax+cx)/2.0, (ay+cy)/2.0, cx, cy,
 currentLevel, maxLevel, 2 * code + 1, x, y );
 }
 return code; 


==Representation as Lindenmayer system==

The Sierpiński curve can be expressed by a rewrite system (L-system).

:Alphabet: F, G, X
:Constants: F, G, +, −
:Axiom: F−−XF−−F−−XF 
:Production rules: 
::X → XF+G+XF−−F−−XF+G+X
:Angle: 45

Here, both &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; mean &quot;draw forward&quot;, + means &quot;turn left 45°&quot;, and &quot;−&quot; means &quot;turn right 45°&quot; (see turtle graphics). The curve is usually drawn with different lengths for F and G.

The Sierpiński square curve can be similarly expressed:

:Alphabet: F, X
:Constants: F, +, −
:Axiom: F+XF+F+XF 
:Production rules: 
::X → XF−F+F−XF+F+XF−F+F−X
:Angle: 90

==Arrowhead curve==
The Sierpiński arrowhead curve is a fractal curve similar in appearance and identical in limit to the Sierpiński triangle.

The Sierpiński arrowhead curve draws an equilateral triangle with triangular holes at equal intervals. It can be described with two substituting production rules: (A → B-A-B) and (B → A+B+A). A and B recur and at the bottom do the same thing — draw a line. Plus and minus (+ and -) mean turn 60 degrees either left or right. The terminating point of the Sierpiński arrowhead curve is always the same provided you recur an even number of times and you halve the length of the line at each recursion. If you recur to an odd depth (order is odd) then you end up turned 60 degrees, at a different point in the triangle.

An alternate construction is given in the article on the de Rham curve: one uses the same technique as the de Rham curves, but instead of using a binary (base-2) expansion, one uses a ternary (base-3) expansion.
===Code===
Given the drawing functions codice_1 and codice_2, the code to draw an (approximate) Sierpiński arrowhead curve looks like this:
void sierpinski_arrowhead_curve(unsigned order, double length)
 // If order is even we can just draw the curve.
 if ( 0 == (order &amp; 1) ) {
 curve(order, length, +60);
 else /* order is odd */ {
 turn( +60);
 curve(order, length, -60);
}

void curve(unsigned order, double length, int angle)
 if ( 0 == order ) {
 draw_line(length);
 } else {
 curve(order - 1, length / 2, -angle);
 turn(angle);
 curve(order - 1, length / 2, angle);
 turn(angle);
 curve(order - 1, length / 2, -angle);
}
===Representation as Lindenmayer system===
The Sierpiński arrowhead curve can be expressed by a rewrite system (L-system).

:Alphabet: X, Y
:Constants: F, +, −
:Axiom: XF 
:Production rules: 
::X → YF + XF + Y
::Y → XF − YF − X

Here, &quot;F&quot; means &quot;draw forward&quot;, + means &quot;turn left 60°&quot;, and &quot;−&quot; means &quot;turn right 60°&quot; (see turtle graphics).

<text>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology is a book about epistemology by the philosopher Ayn Rand (with an additional article by Leonard Peikoff). Rand considered it her most important philosophical writing. First published in installments in Rand&#x27;s journal, &quot;The Objectivist&quot;, July 1966 through February 1967, the work presents Rand&#x27;s proposed solution to the historic problem of universals, describes how the theory can be extended to complex cases, and outlines how it applies to other issues in the theory of knowledge.

==Summary==
Rand bases her solution to the problem of universals on a quasi-mathematical analysis of similarity. Rejecting the common view that similarity is unanalyzable, she defines similarity as: &quot;the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree.&quot;

The grasp of similarity, she holds, requires a contrast between the two or more similar items and a third item that differs from them, but differs along the same scale of measurement (which she termed a &quot;Conceptual Common Denominator&quot;). Thus two shades of blue, to be perceived as similar, must be contrasted with something differing greatly in hue from both—e.g., a shade of red.

Accordingly, Rand defines &quot;concept&quot; as: a &quot;mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s) with their particular measurements omitted.&quot;

The monograph includes chapters outlining the Objectivist theory of how higher-order concepts are formed (&quot;Abstraction from Abstraction&quot;), how measurement applies to phenomena of consciousness, the nature and cognitive significance of definitions (including a defense of essence as being &quot;epistemological&quot; not &quot;metaphysical&quot;), a theory of axiomatic &quot;concepts&quot;, not axiomatic propositions, as being the base of conceptual cognition, the introduction of a &quot;principle of unit economy&quot; as crucial for judging and justifying and conceptual-level content, and a call for the wholesale rejection of the Kantian turn in philosophy, seeing Kant as falsely opposing the identity of consciousness to its cognitive validity—i.e., to its &quot;being&quot; conscious.

&quot;...the attack on man&#x27;s consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a &quot;process&quot; of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is &quot;&#x27;processed&quot; knowledge.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;All knowledge &quot;is&quot; processed knowledge--whether on the sensory, perceptual or conceptual level. An &quot;unprocessed&quot; knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition. Consciousness (as I said in the first sentence of this work) is not a passive state, but an active process.&quot;

An additional essay by Peikoff, based on Rand&#x27;s theory and edited by her, criticizes the analytic–synthetic distinction, arguing that it stems from a wrong theory of what is included in the meaning of a concept. A concept, Rand and Peikoff maintain, includes &quot;all&quot; the characteristics possessed by the referents, not just the defining characteristics.

The 1990 edition of &quot;Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology&quot; includes 200 pages of discussion between Rand and philosophy professionals, culled from tape recordings of the five &quot;Workshops in Objectivist Epistemology&quot; that Rand conducted in late 1969 through early 1970. The most active among those questioning Rand on the meaning and implication of her theory were John O. Nelson, George Walsh, Leonard Peikoff, Allan Gotthelf, and Harry Binswanger. About a dozen others participated to a lesser degree.

==Publication history==
Rand&#x27;s title essay was originally serialized in &quot;The Objectivist&quot; from July 1966 to February 1967, then reprinted by the Nathaniel Branden Institute later in 1967 as a booklet. Peikoff&#x27;s essay was first published in &quot;The Objectivist&quot; in its May 1967 to September 1967 issues. The combined book was published by New American Library in 1979. The same publisher also put out the revised edition, co-edited by Peikoff and Harry Binswanger, in 1990.

==Reception==
Both the original and revised editions of the book received relatively little attention from reviewers, although there was a review in the journal &quot;Teaching Philosophy&quot;.
The work has received extensive, in-depth exposition and development in: &quot;A Companion to Ayn Rand&quot; (Blackwell Companions to Philosophy) Wiley-Blackwell: 2016, Gotthelf and Salmieri (ed.), &quot;Concepts and Their Role in Knowledge: Reflections on Objectivist Epistemology&quot; (Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies), and &quot;How We Know: Epistemology on an Objectivist Foundation&quot; (Binswanger, TOF Publications: 2014).

<doc id="699718" wikidata="Q7921330" url="?curid=699718" title="Software verification and validation">
<text>In software project management, software testing, and software engineering, [[verification and validation]] is the process of checking that a software engineer system meets specifications and requirements so that it fulfills its intended purpose. It may also be referred to as software quality control. It is normally the responsibility of software testers as part of the software development lifecycle. In simple terms, software verification is: &quot;Assuming we should build X, does our software achieve its goals without any bugs or gaps?&quot; On the other hand, software validation is: &quot;Was X what we should have built? Does X meet the high-level requirements?&quot;

==Definitions==
Verification and validation are not the same thing, although they are often confused. Boehm succinctly expressed the difference as
* Verification: Are we building the product right?
* Validation: Are we building the right product?

&quot;Building the product right&quot; checks that the &quot;specifications&quot; are correctly implemented by the system while &quot;building the right product&quot; refers back to the &quot;user&#x27;s needs&quot;. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance. Ideally, formal methods provide a mathematical guarantee that software meets its specifications.

Building the product right implies the use of the Requirements Specification as input for the next phase of the development process, the design process, the output of which is the Design Specification. Then, it also implies the use of the Design Specification to feed the construction process. Every time the output of a process correctly implements its input specification, the software product is one step closer to final verification. If the output of a process is incorrect, the developers have not correctly implemented some component of that process. This kind of verification is called &quot;artifact or specification verification&quot;.

=== Software verification ===
It would imply to verify if the specifications are met by running the software but this is not possible (e.g., how can anyone know if the architecture/design/etc. are correctly implemented by running the software?). Only by reviewing its associated artifacts, can someone conclude whether or not the specifications are met.

=== Artifact or specification verification===
The output of each software development process stage can also be subject to verification when checked against its input specification (see the definition by CMMI below).

Examples of artifact verification:
* Of the design specification against the requirement specification: Do the architectural design, detailed design and database logical model specifications correctly implement the functional and non-functional requirements specifications?
* Of the construction artifacts against the design specification: Do the source code, user interfaces and database physical model correctly implement the design specification?

=== Software validation===
Software validation checks that the software product satisfies or fits the intended use (high-level checking), i.e., the software meets the user requirements, not as specification artifacts or as needs of those who will operate the software only; but, as the needs of all the stakeholders (such as users, operators, administrators, managers, investors, etc.). There are two ways to perform software validation: internal and external. During internal software validation, it is assumed that the goals of the stakeholders were correctly understood and that they were expressed in the requirement artifacts precisely and comprehensively. If the software meets the requirement specification, it has been internally validated. External validation happens when it is performed by asking the stakeholders if the software meets their needs. Different software development methodologies call for different levels of user and stakeholder involvement and feedback; so, external validation can be a discrete or a continuous event. Successful final external validation occurs when all the stakeholders accept the software product and express that it satisfies their needs. Such final external validation requires the use of an acceptance test which is a dynamic test.

However, it is also possible to perform internal static tests to find out if the software meets the requirements specification but that falls into the scope of static verification because the software is not running.

=== Artifact or specification validation ===
Requirements should be validated before the software product as a whole is ready (the waterfall development process requires them to be perfectly defined before design starts; but iterative development processes do not require this to be so and allow their continual improvement).

Examples of artifact validation:

* User Requirements Specification validation: User requirements as stated in a document called User Requirements Specification are validated by checking if they indeed represent the will and goals of the stakeholders. This can be done by interviewing the stakeholders and asking them directly (static testing) or even by releasing prototypes and having the users and stakeholders to assess them (dynamic testing).
* User input validation: User input (gathered by any peripheral such as a keyboard, bio-metric sensor, etc.) is validated by checking if the input provided by the software operators or users meets the domain rules and constraints (such as data type, range, and format).

=== Validation vs. verification===
According to the Capability Maturity Model (CMMI-SW v1.1),
* Software Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610]
* Software Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE-STD-610]

Validation during the software development process can be seen as a form of User Requirements Specification validation; and, that at the end of the development process is equivalent to Internal and/or External Software validation. Verification, from CMMI&#x27;s point of view, is evidently of the artifact kind.

In other words, software verification ensures that the output of each phase of the software development process effectively carries out what its corresponding input artifact specifies (requirement -&gt; design -&gt; software product), while software validation ensures that the software product meets the needs of all the stakeholders (therefore, the requirement specification was correctly and accurately expressed in the first place). Software verification ensures that &quot;you built it right&quot; and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the plans of the developers. Software validation ensures that &quot;you built the right thing&quot; and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the intended use and goals of the stakeholders.

This article has used the strict or narrow definition of verification.

From a testing perspective:
* Fault – wrong or missing function in the code.
* Failure – the manifestation of a fault during execution. The software was not effective. It does not do &quot;what&quot; it is supposed to do.
* Malfunction – according to its specification the system does not meet its specified functionality. The software was not efficient (it took too many resources such as CPU cycles, it used too much memory, performed too many I/O operations, etc.), it was not usable, it was not reliable, etc. It does not do something &quot;how&quot; it is supposed to do it.

==Related concepts==
Both verification and validation are related to the concepts of quality and of software quality assurance. By themselves, verification and validation do not guarantee software quality; planning, traceability, configuration management and other aspects of software engineering are required.

Within the modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) community, the definitions of verification, validation and accreditation are similar:

* M&amp;S Verification is the process of determining that a computer model, simulation, or federation of models and simulation implementations and their associated data accurately represent the developer&#x27;s conceptual description and specifications.
* M&amp;S Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model, simulation, or federation of models and simulations, and their associated data are accurate representations of the real world from the perspective of the intended use(s).
* Accreditation is the formal certification that a model or simulation is acceptable to be used for a specific purpose.
The definition of M&amp;S validation focuses on the accuracy with which the M&amp;S represents the real-world intended use(s). Determining the degree of M&amp;S accuracy is required because all M&amp;S are approximations of reality, and it is usually critical to determine if the degree of approximation is acceptable for the intended use(s). This stands in contrast to software validation.

==V&amp;V methods==
===Formal ===
In mission-critical software systems, formal methods may be used to ensure the correct operation of a system. These formal methods can prove costly, however, representing as much as 80 percent of total software design cost.

==Independent ==
Independent Software Verification and Validation (ISVV) is targeted at safety-critical software systems and aims to increase the quality of software products, thereby reducing risks and costs throughout the operational life of the software. The goal of ISVV is to provide assurance that software performs to the specified level of confidence and within its designed parameters and defined requirements.

ISVV activities are performed by independent engineering teams, not involved in the software development process, to assess the processes and the resulting products. The ISVV team independency is performed at three different levels: financial, managerial and technical.

ISVV goes beyond &quot;traditional&quot; verification and validation techniques, applied by development teams. While the latter aims to ensure that the software performs well against the nominal requirements, ISVV is focused on non-functional requirements such as robustness and reliability, and on conditions that can lead the software to fail.

ISVV results and findings are fed back to the development teams for correction and improvement.

=== History ===
ISVV derives from the application of IV&amp;V (Independent Verification and Validation) to the software. Early ISVV application (as known today) dates back to the early 1970s when the U.S. Army sponsored the first significant program related to IV&amp;V for the Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile System. Another example is NASA&#x27;s IV&amp;V Program, which was established in 1993.

By the end of the 1970s IV&amp;V was rapidly becoming popular. The constant increase in complexity, size and importance of the software led to an increasing demand on IV&amp;V applied to software.

Meanwhile, IV&amp;V (and ISVV for software systems) consolidated and is now widely used by organizations such as the DoD, FAA, NASA and ESA. IV&amp;V is mentioned in DO-178B, ISO/IEC 12207 and formalized in IEEE 1012.

==== At ESA ====
Initially in 2004-2005, a European consortium led by the European Space Agency, and composed of DNV, Critical Software SA, Terma and CODA SciSys plc created the first version of a guide devoted to ISVV, called &quot;ESA Guide for Independent Verification and Validation&quot; with support from other organizations. This guide covers the methodologies applicable to all the software engineering phases in what concerns ISVV.

In 2008 the European Space Agency released a second version, having received inputs from many different European Space ISVV stakeholders.

=== Methodology===
ISVV is usually composed of five principal phases, these phases can be executed sequentially or as results of a tailoring process.

==== Planning ====

* Planning of ISVV activities
* System criticality analysis: Identification of critical components through a set of RAMS activities (Value for Money)
* Selection of the appropriate methods and tools

==== Requirements verification ====

* Verification for: completeness, correctness, testability

==== Design verification ====

* Design adequacy and conformance to software requirements and interfaces
* Internal and external consistency
* Verification of feasibility and maintenance

==== Code verification ====

* Verification for: completeness, correctness, consistency
* Code metrics analysis
* Coding standards compliance verification

==== Validation ====
* Identification of unstable components/functionalities
* Validation focused on error-handling: complementary (not concurrent) validation regarding the one performed by the development team
* Compliance with software and system requirements
* Black box testing and White box testing techniques
* Experience based techniques

==Regulatory environment==
Software often must meet the compliance requirements of legally regulated industries, which is often guided by government agencies or industrial administrative authorities. For instance, the FDA requires software versions and patches to be validated.

<doc id="699722" wikidata="Q488013" url="?curid=699722" title="Rømer scale">
<text>The Rømer scale (; notated as °Rø), also known as Romer or Roemer, is a temperature scale named after the Danish astronomer Ole Christensen Rømer, who developed it for his own use in around 1702. It is based on the freezing point of pure water being 7.5 degrees and the boiling point of water as 60 degrees.

== Degree measurements ==
There is no solid evidence as to why Rømer assigned the value of 7.5 degrees to water&#x27;s freezing point. One proposed explanation is that Rømer initially intended the 0-degree point of his scale to correspond to the eutectic temperature of ammonium chloride brine, which was the coldest easily-reproducible temperature at the time and had already been used as the lower fiducial point for multiple temperature scales. The boiling point of water was defined as 60 degrees. Rømer then saw that the freezing point of pure water was roughly one eighth of the way (about 7.5 degrees) between these two points, so he redefined the lower fixed point to be the freezing point of water at precisely 7.5 degrees. This did not greatly change the scale but made it easier to calibrate by defining it by reference to pure water. Thus the unit of this scale, a Rømer degree, is formula_1 of a kelvin or Celsius degree. The symbol is sometimes given as °R, but since that is also sometimes used for the Réaumur and Rankine scales, the other symbol °Rø is to be preferred.

== Historical significance ==
Rømer&#x27;s scale would have been lost to history if Rømer&#x27;s notebook, Adverseria, was not found and published in 1910 and letters of correspondence between Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit and Herman Boerhaave were not uncovered in 1936. These documents demonstrate the important influence Rømer&#x27;s work had on Fahrenheit, a young maker and seller of barometers and thermometers.

Fahrenheit visited Rømer in Copenhagen in 1708 and while there, became familiar with Rømer&#x27;s work with thermometers. Rømer also told Fahrenheit that demand for accurate thermometers was high. The visit ignited a keen interest in Fahrenheit to try to improve thermometers.

By 1713, Fahrenheit was creating his own thermometers with a scale heavily borrowed from Rømer that ranged from 0 to 24 degrees but with each degree divided into quarters. At some point, the quarter degrees became whole degrees and Fahrenheit made other adjustments to Rømer&#x27;s scale, modifying the freezing point from 7.5 degrees to 8, which, when multiplied by four, correlates to 32 degrees on Fahrenheit&#x27;s scale The 22.5 degree point would have become 90 degrees, however, Fahrenheit rounded this up to 24 degrees–96 when multiplied by 4–in order to make calculations easier.

After Fahrenheit perfected the crafting of his accurate thermometers, their use became widespread and the Fahrenheit scale is still used today in the United States and a handful of other countries.

<doc id="699726" wikidata="Q1399589" url="?curid=699726" title="Opium (KMFDM album)">
<text>Opium is a demo album by German industrial band KMFDM released as a cassette in 1984, and officially released as a CD in 2002 by Firstworld. It is one of only two KMFDM studio albums (the other being &quot;Nihil&quot;) that does not feature cover artwork by pop artist Brute!.

The original 1984 cassette&#x27;s authenticity has been questioned by fans, which was further complicated by a social media post by former member Raymond Watts, who claimed that &quot;Opium&quot; was created from scratch in the 1990s. The supposed original version of &quot;Opium&quot; featured a different tracklisting, and its details were shared by KMFDM initially in 1997.

==Release==

Sascha Konietzko has stated that &quot;Opium&quot; was originally released in a limited run of cassettes and distributed through the Hamburg club scene in 1984. In the early 2000s, the original 8-track tapes were salvaged from a house, after surviving a fire and years of sitting in damp boxes. This had left them in a damaged state. Konietzko further claims that he salvaged what information was still intact on the tapes, and then set about re-creating the tracks. This included reprogramming drums on some tracks with the original sounds, or sounds close to the original.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;Outburn Magazine&quot;, Konietzko said the &quot;Opium&quot; remaster &quot;...is going to provide the missing link to &#x27;Where did KMFDM even come from in the first place?&#x27;. If you begin with &quot;What Do You Know, Deutschland?&quot; you kind of skip the first part.&quot;

Despite Konietzko&#x27;s claims, fan were dubious about the authenticity of the re-release. Musically, it sounded far more advanced than any other material from the era (&quot;84–86&quot; or &quot;What Do You Know, Deutschland?&quot;), and it was conveniently released at a time when Konietzko was trying to write co-founder En Esch out of KMFDM&#x27;s history. During an online feud between Konietzko and Raymond Watts in 2022, Watts revealed that &quot;contrary to bullshit myth making stories about fires and lost tapes, &quot;Opium&quot; was recorded in the mid 90s by Bill Rieflin, Konietzko and me.&quot; Neither he nor Konietzko have spoken further about the album, so its true origins remain unconfirmed.

<text>The Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC) is Europe&#x27;s largest primate animal testing research centre. It is a scientific research institute that performs research that contributes to the identification and development of new medicines against deadly diseases. It is located in Rijswijk (South Holland) and employs about 110 people.

The BPRC is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Before it became an independent foundation on December 7, 1994, it was part of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research.

The main research areas are Immunobiology, Parasitology, Virology, Ethology and Alternatives for Animal Research. The BPRC houses rhesus macaques and marmosets to be used in biomedical research involving AIDS, malaria, hepatitis, tuberculosis and auto-immune diseases.

In 2002 the Dutch government forbade any further testing on chimpanzees, though it allowed trials already in progress to end. In 2015, BPRC was reported to use about 200 monkeys a year for experiments. Protestors gather regularly in front of the BPRC gates and there are calls in the Dutch parliament to close the centre.

In September 2018, undercover images showed animal abuse at this center leading to questions in the Dutch Parlement.

<doc id="699739" wikidata="Q1129959" url="?curid=699739" title="Thrill Kill">
<text>Thrill Kill is a cancelled fighting video game developed by Paradox Development for the PlayStation. Originally intended to be released in 1998, the game&#x27;s plot involves ten people who all get sent to Hell after dying on Earth and are forced by Marukka, the Goddess of Secrets, to fight to the death for a chance at reincarnation. It was marketed as the first four-player 3D fighting game, as up to four players were able to play at once using the PlayStation Multitap. Each player is given a &quot;kill meter&quot; that increases with each successful attack, which, once filled, executes a gory finishing move called a &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;.

&quot;Thrill Kill&quot; began development as &quot;Earth Monster&quot;, a sports video game based on the Mesoamerican ballgame in which characters attacked one another as they tried to get a ball into a hoop. As developers were repeatedly pushed by publisher Virgin Interactive to make the game more violent, &quot;Earth Monster&quot;″s concept was scrapped in favor of an adult-oriented, BDSM-themed fighting game. It gained a large following prior to its release for its overtly sexual and gory content, and received one of the first-ever &quot;Adults Only&quot; (AO) ratings from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), also becoming the first game to receive the rating for its violence. 

Reviewers of the beta version of &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; considered it fun but unfinished. The game was scheduled to be published by Virgin Interactive, but Electronic Arts gained the publishing rights the same year and chose not to release the game or sell it to other publishers due to its graphic content. Bootleg versions of the game were nonetheless uploaded to pirating websites and it became especially popular as a ROM. Following its cancellation, &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; was reskinned to make the 1999 Activision video game &quot;Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style&quot;, also developed by Paradox, who went on to use &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;″s engine in several of their other games.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay consists of up to four opponents in a closed 3D room fighting to kill one another one-by-one using gory special moves known as &quot;Thrill Kills&quot;. The four attack buttons correspond to each character&#x27;s arms and legs, while attacks are blocked by standing still or by holding down the guard button. Double tapping in any direction allows players to dash. Each character has four throws, including a &quot;Swap Throw&quot;, which causes the player who performs it and the opponent to switch places, and a &quot;Hold Throw&quot;, which pins opponents down in front of the character that performs it. Characters can also perform both high and low counter hits. 

Instead of the usual life bar, characters have a &quot;kill meter&quot; that increases with each successful attack performed. Whichever character fills this meter first must use a Thrill Kill on one other opponent of their choice, which kills them and removes them from the round. The manner of the kill depends on the button input upon grabbing the other character. The round then repeats without the defeated character, with the character who performed a Thrill Kill in the prior round earning a small boost to their kill meter at the start of the round. This continues until there are two fighters left, and whichever fighter&#x27;s kill meter fills up first wins, triggering a final, character-specific death animation.

Players can choose from four different modes. &quot;Arcade Mode&quot; puts players through eight stages against computer-controlled opponents, the first six of which are four-player matches, while the latter two are one-on-one battles against the characters Judas and Marukka, respectively. &quot;Versus Mode&quot; allows players to fight with up to three other players or computer-controlled fighters. In order to play with all four players, players required the PlayStation Multitap. &quot;Team Mode&quot; splits players into two teams, with each team sharing a single kill meter. &quot;Training Mode&quot; is a single-player mode which allows players to test individual characters&#x27; moves on a computer opponent; performing each move in a character&#x27;s moveset in this mode unlocks a fifth costume for the character. Stages include Dante&#x27;s Cage, the Crematorium, Sacrificial Ruins, Chamber of Anguish, the Lavatory, Insane Asylum, Slaughterhouse of Flesh, Sewer of Styx, Sinner&#x27;s Cell, and Homicide Avenue.

==Characters==
In the story of &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;, Marukka decides out of boredom to gather ten people who have been sent to Hell for their sins to fight to the death for a chance at being reincarnated. There are eleven playable characters:
* Belladonna Marie Cocherto / Belladonna: A librarian who became a dominatrix and killed both her husband and sister after discovering that they were having an affair. She died after electrocuting herself with a cattle prod. She now uses this prod to fight and has sexually suggestive moves.
* Cain: An arsonist who got trapped inside a building he set on fire and was burned alive. His attacks have the widest reach in the game and he can also shoot fire out of his backside.
* Cleetus T. Radley / Cleetus: A cannibal who sold &quot;homestyle&quot; sausages made from human remains, and died due to a tapeworm infection from one of his victims. He fights using a bloody, detached leg, and can also bite his opponents.
* Gabriel Faustus / Dr. Faustus: A plastic surgeon who killed and purposely disfigured his patients and died from infection after affixing a bear trap to his face. His weapon is a scalpel and he also attacks using his metal mouth.
* Billy B. Tattoo / The Imp: A dwarf &quot;leather daddy&quot; with a hatred for tall people, who died after amputating his legs and sticking stilts in them. Unlike the rest of the characters (excluding Judas), The Imp is not revealed to have killed anyone during his time on Earth. He uses his stilts as weapons. Some members of Paradox&#x27;s team resented &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; producer Harvard Bonin for attempting to change the game to give it a different ESRB rating, and modeled The Imp after Bonin as a jab at him.
* Judas: A pair of conjoined twins connected at the torso. It is never explained how Judas ended up in Hell. While one twin acts as the upper half, the other twin acts as the lower half, using their arms to hold them up.
* Franklin Peppermint / Mammoth: A postal employee who &quot;went postal&quot; after getting fired. He committed suicide afterward by shooting himself. He resembles a large, skinless gorilla and fights with his fists.
* Marukka: A demon and the &quot;Goddess of Secrets&quot; who gathers the other fighters to brawl for a chance at being reincarnated. While fighting, she can teleport.
* Raymond Raystack / Oddball: An FBI behavioral analyst who became a serial killer. He died after being gunned down by his protégé. He still wears a straitjacket in Hell and cannot use his arms, so he primarily uses kicks and headbutts to attack, and can also use breakdancing to fight.
* William J. Whitefield / Tormentor: A judge who would acquit criminals in order to kidnap and torture them later, and was eventually executed for his crimes. His outfit is bondage-themed, and he fights using a heated whip.
* Violet Boregard / Violet: A circus contortionist who developed a strong hatred for men after being raped by one who broke into her dressing room, whom she later killed. She died of a spinal cord rupture. She uses her contortion skills to fight opponents.

A twelfth non-player character, The Gimp, inspired by &quot;the gimp&quot; from the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, can be unlocked as an opponent in Training Mode.

==Development and cancellation==
In the late 1990s, Paradox Development began development on a PlayStation game titled &quot;Earth Monster&quot;, a fantasy sports game based on the Mesoamerican ballgame where players would control large, muscular Aztec warriors who punched and kicked one another while trying to get a ball into a hoop. The game&#x27;s publisher, Virgin Interactive, repeatedly encouraged the developers to make the fighting aspect more violent, before eventually deciding to turn the project entirely into a fighting game. Its Aztec aesthetic was soon replaced by one inspired by BDSM and intended by Virgin to cause controversy, which they hoped would help it sell better. Harvard Bonin, the producer assigned to &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;, showed developers fetish magazines, such as &quot;Skin Two&quot;, and BDSM DVDs as references for the desired art direction.

Designed as an especially violent, &quot;full-blown adult&quot; fighting game and the first four-player 3D fighting game, &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; was meant to compare to the similarly violent &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. Paradox hoped that the game&#x27;s success would help the studio earn mainstream recognition. The plot of &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;, based around each of the characters fighting for a chance at resurrection after being sent to Hell, was written by the game&#x27;s assistant producer, Brian Gomez, and inspired by the musical &quot;Cats&quot;. Moves were given names such as &quot;Bitch Slap&quot;, &quot;Swallow This&quot;, &quot;Crotch Crush&quot;, and &quot;Miner 69er&quot;, and several were designed to resemble sexual acts. According to Bonin, the kill meter system was designed to &quot;promote in-your-face aggression&quot; to contrast &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; from other fighting games that encouraged players to focus on defending their own character. After E3 1998, where &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; was nominated as the most popular game presented at the event, it gained a large following due to its gory and sexual nature. It received one of the first &quot;Adults Only&quot; (AO) ratings from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) after it was submitted, and became the first game to receive the rating solely due to violence as opposed to the rating usually being only given to games with strong sexual/pornographic content. As of 2023, only three other games (&quot;Manhunt 2&quot;, &quot;Hatred&quot; and an unreleased version of &quot;The Punisher&quot;) ever received an AO rating solely for extreme, graphic violence. This prompted Virgin and Bonin to try and get developers to tone down the game&#x27;s content to get it to a &quot;Mature&quot; (M) rating, as an AO rating would prevent it from being sold in many stores. 

&quot;Thrill Kill&quot; was originally set to be released in October 1998. One strategy proposed by Virgin to promote it was to send copies to those opposed to video game violence. In August 1998, the North American operations of Virgin Interactive were acquired by Electronic Arts as part of their purchase of Westwood Studios, which led to EA gaining the publishing rights to &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;. After evaluating the game, EA&#x27;s executive board deemed its tone too violent for publication. By this point, according to senior programmer David Ollman, the game was already 99% finished and a sequel had been proposed, the name of which would have either been &quot;F.U.B.A.R&quot; or &quot;S&amp;M&quot;. Two weeks after acquiring Virgin, the company discontinued the game and declined offers to sell it to other publishers, including Eidos Interactive. According to Louis Castle, founder of Westwood Studios, &quot;EA...was working hard to overcome the industry stigma of games as a more violent medium than film or TV.&quot; Members of &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;″s development team were not directly informed by EA that the game was cancelled and instead found out by reading articles about it on the Internet, according to producer Kevin Mulhall. In later interviews, Paradox employees such as Mulhall and Ollman pointed to EA&#x27;s connections with United States Senator Joe Lieberman, who was staunchly and vocally opposed to video game violence, as an explanation for EA&#x27;s decision to cancel the game.

Although it was never made available for retail purchase, bootleg versions of the game were uploaded to pirating websites by its developers, and it became one of the most popular and frequently downloaded ROMs on the Internet. &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; was later reskinned by Paradox and used to make the 1999 PlayStation fighting game &quot;Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style&quot;, published by Activision and based on the rap group Wu-Tang Clan. The &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; engine later became a core technology for Paradox, and was used in two-player form for the 2000 game &quot;X-Men: Mutant Academy&quot;, its 2001 sequel &quot;X-Men: Mutant Academy 2&quot;, and the 2000 game &quot;Rock &#x27;Em Sock &#x27;Em Robots Arena&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
In a review of the beta version of &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;, &quot;Gamers&#x27; Republic&quot;″s Mike Griffin wrote, &quot;[&quot;Thrill Kill&quot; is] perfect for mindless fun with friends and cold drinks. Mindless, but not brainless. There should be enough depth to the gameplay to satisfy hard-core 3D fighting fans once Paradox has completed its final few months of dedicated beta tweaking.&quot; Griffin also stated, &quot;There are a few bugs right now that prevent Thrill Kill from being completely effective.&quot; Also reviewing the game&#x27;s beta version, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jeff Chen wrote, &quot;The action at this point is somewhat stiff, but it&#x27;s still early, and if you&#x27;re looking for blood and guts, this has got more than we&#x27;d ever imagined. We can&#x27;t wait.&quot;

In their September 2004 issue, &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; cited &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; as one of the most overrated cancelled games, stating, &quot;It got lots of hype. But it really sucked, too.&quot; In 2011, &quot;GamePro&quot; ranked &quot;The Imp&quot; fourteenth on a list of &quot;The 50 Best Fighting Game Characters Ever&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Metro&quot; included &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; on their list of the most offensive games of all time, while &quot;Complex&quot; named &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; the seventh most violent video game. &quot;IGN&quot; named &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; on their list of the biggest unreleased games.

Steven T. Wright of &quot;Variety&quot; considered &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; &quot;perhaps the most notorious unreleased game in the history of the industry&quot;, while, in 2012, &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that it was &quot;perhaps the most famous cancelled game in recent memory&quot;. In a 2013 article for &quot;The Manitoban&quot;, Marc Lagace called the game &quot;a complete disaster, both aesthetically and gameplay-wise&quot; and &quot;perhaps the most controversial game that never was&quot;. Writing for &quot;Kotaku Australia&quot;, Leah Williams wrote, &quot;To look at it now, it all seems a bit naff — but way back in 1998, the content of &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; was extremely controversial.&quot; &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Gavin Jasper called &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;, &quot;Tattoo Assassins&quot;, and &quot;Primal Rage 2&quot; the &quot;holy trinity of almost-to-completely-finished fighting games that didn&#x27;t get released&quot;.

<text>The East Humboldt Range is a mountain range in Elko County, Nevada, United States. It is located along the eastern edge of the upper watershed of the Humboldt River, which flows southwest from its source just north of the range. The range reaches a maximum elevation of atop Hole in the Mountain Peak. Most of the range is included within the Ruby Mountains Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. In 1989, the United States Congress passed the Nevada Wilderness Protection Act, establishing over of the range as the East Humboldt Wilderness. The range takes its name from the Humboldt River. The name ultimately is derived from the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.

The East Humboldts run north-to-south for approximately . To the north are Interstate 80 and the community of Wells, while to the south are Secret Pass, the larger Ruby Range, and Ruby Valley. To the east are Clover Valley and U.S. Route 93, and to the west are Starr Valley and Dennis Flats.

These mountains were formed by a tilted fault-block process, with gradual slopes and valleys to the west and a steep escarpment to the east. Both sides of the range show extensive evidence of glaciation during recent ice ages, including U-shaped canyons, moraines, and steeply carved granite mountains, cliffs, and cirques. All of these features can be seen from the paved road from Wells to scenic Angel Lake.

The range begins with a dramatic rise from a point near the source of the Humboldt River and the community of Wells, at an elevation of , to the summit of Greys Peak at . From there, the range continues south for nearly as a high crest, staying mostly above . The center section of this crest includes the range high point, Hole in the Mountain Peak. The southernmost high summit of the range is Humboldt Peak (), after which the main crest begins a gradual descent, forming the northeastern slopes of Secret Pass and the eastern side of North Ruby Valley.

The range includes many glacial tarns, including Angel Lake, Smith Lake, Greys Lake, and Winchell Lake to the north, and Lizzie&#x27;s Basin, Boulder Lakes, and Steele Lake in the central section.

Hiking trails run from Secret Pass up the western side of the range all the way around to Angel Lake, from Angel Lake to nearby Smith Lake, and from a trailhead near Angel Lake down the east side of the range to Winchell Lake and Lizzie&#x27;s Basin. Public access is principally found at Angel Lake, a trailhead at the west end of Secret Pass, and via a primitive road at Weeks Canyon/Lizzie&#x27;s Basin.

<doc id="699752" wikidata="Q7662653" url="?curid=699752" title="Syntactic methods">
<text>In software engineering, syntactic methods are techniques for developing correct software programs. The techniques attempt to detect, and thus prevent, certain kinds of defects (bugs) by examining the structure of the code being produced at its syntactic rather than semantic level.

==Usage==

Syntactic methods are often used when formal methods are not an option, and are often a simpler and, more importantly, cheaper alternative. In non-mission-critical systems, formal methods may prove to be too expensive for the benefit they provide. The costs of modelling, personnel, execution and development may often outweigh the benefits gained by preventing possible failures. This approach revolves around the use of an &quot;abstract dependency graph&quot; which is created from the system in question. An abstract dependency graph is a directed graph, a graph of vertices connected by one-way edges. Most often, the vertices and edges of the graph represent the inputs and outputs of functions in or components of the system. By inspecting the created abstract dependency graph, the developer can detect &quot;syntactic anomalies&quot; (or &quot;Preece anomalies&quot;) in the system. While anomalies are not always defects, they often provide clues to finding defects in a system. Therefore, the anomalies in a system help point the developer in the right direction in finding defects.

==Anomalies==

There are four main types of anomaly:

* &quot;Redundancies&quot; – A chunk of the graph is redundant if its terminals can be reached if the chunk is removed from the graph
* &quot;Conflicts&quot; – A system contains conflicts if the same inputs can imply different outputs
* &quot;Circularities&quot; – A loop in the graph indicates a circularity in the system
* &quot;Deficiencies&quot; – A chunk is deficient if a subset of inputs leads to no terminals

While anomalies often point to defects, they can just as easily reflect normal intended functionality in the system. It is up to the developer to look into anomalies in order to determine whether they are clues to problems or simply false alarms.

By creating a visual directed graph of a system, there are several obvious visual flags that indicate the above anomalies:

* a sub-graph with no input is probably missing something important;
* while looking at the transitive closure of a system (all nodes downstream from a node), a node in its own transitive closure indicates a circularity;
* while looking at the transitive closure of a system, subsumption between pairs of rows indicates redundancy;
* conflicts are somewhat more difficult as they become more semantic than syntactic.

When formal methods prove too costly, a system can be checked solely on its syntax. This is not as thorough, as it only looks at a system on a surface level. However, it does give a developer many clues as to where a system&#x27;s defects may lie.

<doc id="699761" wikidata="Q1755780" url="?curid=699761" title="Hitman (DC Comics)">
<text>Hitman (Tommy Monaghan) is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Garth Ennis and John McCrea and first appeared in &quot;The Demon Annual&quot; #2 before receiving his own series by Ennis and McCrea that ran for 61 issues.

==Background==
&quot;Hitman&quot; chronicles the exploits of Tommy Monaghan, an ex-Marine Gulf War veteran turned contract killer from the Cauldron, a lower-class Irish district of Gotham City. He first appears in &quot;The Demon Annual&quot; #2 (part of the &quot;Bloodlines&quot; crossover in the summer of 1993), when he is attacked and bitten by a Bloodlines parasite called Glonth. Instead of dying, the bite unexpectedly triggers his metagene and grants him x-ray vision and moderate telepathy. A side effect is that his corneas and irises are solid black, indistinguishable from his pupils; the sight managed to unnerve Batman when he first saw them. The inherited powers later come with limits, and Monaghan uses them selectively, both because of the difficulty of concentrating during an explosive firefight and the side effects of their extended use (which includes anything between a headache and a minor illness).

After gaining these powers, Monaghan decides to specialize in killing metahumans and supernatural threats, targets typically shunned by conventional contract killers as too dangerous or too expensive. Despite his powers, Monaghan relies most on his creativity, improvisational abilities, and impressive gunfighting skills to take down a majority of his targets. This specialty line of work gives him an edge over his competition, but also leads him to encountering a number of eclectic characters including demons, zombies, dinosaurs, gods, superheroes and supervillains, as well as more conventional, realistic characters such as CIA agents, the SAS and the Mafia.

The series is firmly entrenched in the DC Universe. Batman, the Joker, Green Lantern, Catwoman, Etrigan, and Superman all guest star at various points, and joking references are frequently made to then-current DC happenings (such as the long-haired Superman). The series also crossed over with many DC events, including &quot;Final Night&quot;, &quot;One Million&quot;, and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. Monaghan also teamed with Lobo and has made a few appearances outside the series.

Although the character adopts the moniker &quot;Hitman&quot; in his first appearance, the name is never used in his own series; the rest of the time, he is referred to by his given name (although he was sometimes called &quot;Hitman&quot; in guest appearances).

==Characters==
*Tommy Monaghan: Tommy Monaghan is a hitman from &quot;The Cauldron&quot;, the Irish section of Gotham City. He received telepathy and X-ray vision after being bitten by an alien from &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, something which he generally tries to keep secret. With or without the powers, he is as good as any hitman in Gotham. He was raised in Saint Killian&#x27;s orphanage by Sister Concepta, spending much of his childhood with Pat Noonan and Pat&#x27;s uncle, Sean. He first saw a gun when a bully pulled one on him after a fight; he survived after he stared the bully down. Tommy intended to go to Gotham University with Pat in 1989 and the two tried to buy pot off a local thug to resell it at university – when the dealer tried to threaten Pat for more money, Tommy shot him. In order for Sean to convince the dealer&#x27;s cousins not to retaliate, Tommy had to leave Gotham and he joined the United States Marine Corps. There he met and befriended Natt (and killed his second victims, two Marines trying to assault Natt). They went to the Gulf War together, and inadvertently killed some British SAS soldiers one night in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; incident they never reported. After the war, he returned to Gotham and became a professional hitman. He always wears sunglasses to hide his all-black eyes – another side effect of &quot;Bloodlines&quot;. He is unable to cry with these eyes.
*Natt the Hat: Natt &quot;the Hat&quot; Walls is Tommy&#x27;s partner. Growing up in Detroit, he joined the Marines to get away from the gangs. There he met and befriended Tommy. They went to the Gulf War together, and inadvertently killed some British SAS soldiers one night in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; incident they never reported. After the war, he tried to return to his gang, but a policeman saved his life and the gang suspected treachery. Natt fled, settling into Gotham with Tommy. Natt promised his dying mother that he would no longer curse, as &quot;the air used to turn blue around&quot; him. He starts swearing again around issue #23, due to the current situation. The series uses the term &quot;mothaloving&quot; in place of more realistic swearing.
*Sean Noonan: Sean Noonan is Tommy&#x27;s father figure. Sean raised his nephew Pat, Tommy&#x27;s best friend since youth. Sean was at one time a hitman of some reputation in the city. When he was seven, Sean fled an abusive father and accidentally got stuck on ; inspired by the courage and sacrifice of the British sailors, he went back to save his mother. Years later, he joined the Marines and fought in Korea, where he saw every man in his platoon die. He came to Gotham, got a job tending bar, and eventually won the bar in a poker game. &quot;Noonan&#x27;s Sleazy Bar&quot; became the resident hang out for local hitmen: &quot;Sleazy Bar&quot; was originally graffiti put up by Pat and Tommy in 1979, which Sean intended to paint over for ten years before giving up. Around that time, he saved a young police officer named Connolly from two robbers. In such ways, he collected many favors over the years. He wanted &quot;The Old Dog&quot; put on his tombstone; after his death in 2000, Tommy instead put &quot;Beloved Father&quot;.
*Ringo Chen: is the other best hitman in town and even more cold-blooded than Tommy (though nobody is sure who is deadlier). There is always tension between the two, as everybody expects they will square off one day. Despite this, he and Tommy get to be close. Ringo grew up in an extremely poor village in China, but never went hungry because his parents would often go without food instead; in order to tend to them once he grew up, he joined the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. When he refused to shoot protestors in Tiananmen Square, he was imprisoned, tortured – and his parents were murdered. He escaped, killed his commanders and fled to New York, where he became a hitman, initially for his cousin, later freelance. Ringo believes that he met Death once, after a hit. Ringo was inspired by Chow Yun Fat&#x27;s gun wielding characters in movies directed by John Woo.
*Deborah Tiegel: Deborah Tiegel is Tommy&#x27;s love interest for most of the series. An officer in the Gotham Police Department, she eventually is thrown off the force for not participating in widespread corruption. She lives with her senile grandfather and her mother – with her grandfather implied to be an ex-Nazi, which everyone ignores. She is always referred to as the only truly good person in Tommy&#x27;s life, and often breaks up with him because he kills people for a living. She is an exceptional marksman, and often provides sniper cover for the heroes amid large firefights.
*Hacken: Hacken hangs out at Noonan&#x27;s as much as anybody (including Sean) and joins in with the killer talk, but does not seem to be a professional; they mostly just make fun of him. At one point, he refers to himself and Ringo as partners, &quot;just like Tommy and Natt&quot;, and Ringo doesn&#x27;t have the heart to dissuade him. Early on in the series, having become involved in a zombie battle at the Gotham Aquarium, Hacken cuts off his own zombie bitten hand – only to shortly thereafter discover the bite would not in fact have killed him. Hacken wanted to help Tommy and Natt in their final battle but was knocked unconscious by Tommy, so that he&#x27;d survive. &quot;JLA/Hitman&quot; and #50 show that he continues to stay at Noonan&#x27;s until his old age, and fifty years after Tommy&#x27;s death he tells some Gotham Uni students the truth about his friends. Hacken is later seen trying to assist Superman with alien difficulty in Metropolis. He had also made friends with long-time Superman fan Bibbo Bibbowski. Hacken is later seen trying to improve his mind by joining a book club. He also keeps an eye out for Sixpack, who has returned to chaos of Noonan&#x27;s Bar. This is being run by Baytor, a demon from Hell.
* Pat Noonan is Sean&#x27;s nephew, and Tommy&#x27;s best friend since childhood. The first time Tommy killed somebody was to save Pat&#x27;s life. When the series begins, he is Tommy&#x27;s weapon supplier. He makes fun of Hacken more than anybody else does, and the bar patrons (especially Hacken) regard him as a loudmouth. When Natt arrives, Pat grows more insecure about his friendship with Tommy. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, he dies rather than talk when Johnny Navarone tortures him for information – a grief-stricken Tommy tells him he wishes Pat had talked. 
* Sixpack is a short drunk who thinks he is a superhero. He often has drunken delusions of team-ups with Batman and other heroes. He occasionally leads his superhero team, Section 8. He ends up becoming a real hero, sacrificing himself to save the city from demons. The regulars at Noonan&#x27;s build a statue to him in a local park.
* Sister Concepta is a nun who works at Saint Killian&#x27;s. She took a special interest in Tommy growing up, partly because she had a romantic relationship with Sean Noonan.
* Wendy is the first woman Tommy dates in the series. She believes descriptions of his life are humorous jokes, and she dumps him as soon as she finds out they are not. She returns to the series sporadically.
* Baytor is the Lord of Insanity in Hell, until Etrigan steals his crown. He escapes Hell, and becomes the bartender at Noonan&#x27;s. With rare exceptions, he says only &quot;I am Baytor!&quot; – he says his only normal words in #60 (&quot;goodbye boys&quot;), after Tommy and Natt go to their deaths and when nobody can hear him. He has the ability to project a liquid onto enemies, which dries. The enemies then shatter. He continues to tend Noonan&#x27;s for at least fifty years. 
* Maggie Lorenzo is a poor local woman who first meets Tommy when her son goes missing. Eventually, she turns to Tommy whenever she has a problem. In the final story, she is marked for death by the CIA after seeing something she shouldn&#x27;t have.
* Kathryn McAllister is Tommy&#x27;s last love interest in the series. A CIA agent modeled after Dana Scully from &quot;The X-Files&quot;, she first shows up in a one-page gag in &quot;Local Heroes&quot; (in which she manipulates Green Lantern, as ordered by Agent Truman). In &quot;Closing Time&quot;, the final arc of the series, McAllister has left Truman&#x27;s employ and enlists Tommy and Natt to take Truman down. 
** In Ennis&#x27; Marvel Max run on the Punisher, he has a CIA agent named Kathryn O&#x27;Brien with the same personality and appearance as McAllister: #5 says she was in jail before the CIA rehired her, #21 says she used to have the surname &quot;McAllister&quot;, and in #40 she refers to &quot;that stupid bastard Tommy&quot; as the sort of &quot;truly, irrevocably doomed&quot; man she falls for. It is likely they are intended to be the same character. 
* Etrigan the Demon initially met Tommy immediately following the Bloodlines parasite attack that grants Tommy&#x27;s powers, participating in the incident in which Joe Dubelz was killed. It later hired Tommy to kill a rival demon, then refused to pay him. After this betrayal, Tommy teamed up with Jason Blood to steal The Demon&#x27;s heart. The final time it met Tommy (and the only time within the actual &quot;Hitman&quot; comic book; the other three incidents took place in the comic book &quot;The Demon&quot;, also written by Ennis and drawn by McCrea), it provided Tommy with a gun that can kill the demon Mawzir in exchange for Tommy recovering Etrigan&#x27;s stolen heart.

=== Villains ===
* Moe Dubelz is one half of a pair of conjoined twins who share a body. His brother Joe is killed by Tommy, and he swears revenge. The brothers control one of Gotham&#x27;s major mobs.
* The Mawzir is a demon from Hell who attempts to enlist Tommy&#x27;s services for its masters, the Lords of the Gun (also called the Arkannone). The Mawzir is formed from the souls of five dead Nazis who were executed by the Russians towards the end of the Second World War.
* Night Fist is a Gotham City vigilante who uses oversized fists as weapons. He also steals criminal&#x27;s drugs for his own use and profit. 
* Johnny Navarone is the best assassin in the world; he travels the world killing only the best local killers. Moe Dubelz hires him to kill Tommy. Later, his son, who is an even better marksman, is hired by Truman to kill Tommy.
* Agent Truman is a CIA agent who is jealous of superhumans. He attempts to hire Tommy as an agent to rein in and possibly kill heroes, and later funds experiments trying to recreate the effects of &quot;Bloodlines&quot;.
* Doctor Jackson from the Injun Peak Facility always hires Tommy and Natt to clean up his messes when various experiments his scientists are performing escape go wrong.
* &quot;Men&#x27;s Room&quot; Louie Feretti is one of the main mob bosses in Gotham. He is so named because, due to a medical condition, he requires constant toilet use, from where he conducts all business. Eventually, Tommy is falsely blamed for his death, and various other Ferettis try to take revenge.

==The series==

Hitman first appeared during Garth Ennis&#x27;s run on &quot;The Demon&quot; during the &quot;Bloodlines&quot; crossover, and subsequently appeared in two further arcs before the series was cancelled. After making a brief appearance in a Batman comic, he got his own self-titled series.

&quot;Hitman&quot; was first published as a 60-issue comic book series with one annual, one &quot;DC One Million&quot; tie-in issue, one crossover with Lobo and one appearance in &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; #26. Issues were more or less published monthly and most were 22 pages.

Several collections were published in trade paperback, but the second half of the series had initially never been collected. What collections that had been published were left to go out-of-print over the years. In July 2009 DC began reprinting the trades, from the beginning, with some variation.

The character was due to make an appearance in an arc of &quot;JLA Classified&quot;, and Ennis had this to say about it:

I miss &quot;Hitman&quot; a lot. &quot;Preacher&quot; finished when it was supposed to, so there are no regrets with it—but &quot;Hitman&quot; could have gone on a lot longer. John McCrea and I are actually doing four issues of &quot;JLA Classified&quot;, featuring what is effectively the &quot;lost&quot; &quot;Hitman&quot; story, the one that we never had space for in the monthly. Writing Tommy and the boys again was sheer joy&quot;.

Because of the backlog of other stories for the series, DC decided to release the story as a two issue miniseries titled &quot;JLA/Hitman&quot;.

===Trades===
Starting in 2009, the entire &quot;Hitman&quot; series is being reprinted or collected for the first time in seven volumes.

Vol. 1: Hitman
* In &quot;Hitman&quot; (&quot;The Demon Annual&quot; #2), a hitman named Tommy Monaghan is bitten by Glonth, an alien (from &quot;Bloodlines&quot;), and gets superhuman powers. He teams up with Etrigan the Demon to fight Glonth and kills Joe Dubelz, a mob boss whose Siamese twin brother Moe puts a price on Tommy&#x27;s head. The issue also introduces Pat, Sean, and Noonan&#x27;s Sleazy Bar.
* In &quot;Hitman&quot; (&quot;Batman Chronicles&quot; #4), Tommy takes a hit on a walking biological agent named Thrax who escaped into Gotham, and a &quot;tenth-rate assassin&quot; named Martin Eckstein attempts to earn the Dubelz reward. Eckstein, captured by Batman, reveals that Tommy is going to kill the Joker in Arkham Asylum.
* In &quot;A Rage in Arkham&quot; (issues #1–3), Tommy begins a relationship with a woman named Wendy. He tells her that he is a killer, but she believes it is all an elaborate joke. Tommy enters Arkham by use of stun grenades on several police. Tommy, Batman, Detective Tiegel and the real Joker have multiple encounters; it is all because of the demonic Arkanonne, the Lords of Gunfire, and their agent, the Mawzir, who want Tommy to work for them.

Vol. 2: 10,000 Bullets
* &quot;10,000 Bullets&quot; (#4-7) begins with Moe Dubelz hiring Johnny Navarone to kill Tommy. Navarone hires Tommy (and Natt, newly arrived in Gotham) for a hit and then injures them in an ambush. Tommy makes Natt take him to Wendy&#x27;s and calls Sean to perform medical services. As soon as Tommy is healthy, she throws them out and dumps him. They go home to find Pat dying, tortured by Navarone for information. Tommy and Nat kill Dubelz, his men and Navarone.
* In &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out&quot; (#8), a crossover with &quot;The Final Night&quot;, Tommy, Natt, Sean, Hacken and Ringo sit in Noonan&#x27;s and recount stories of the closest each has come to death. Ringo specifically tells about the time (he believes) he met Death.
* In 2010, this trade was reprinted with an additional story: In &quot;Coffin Full of Dollars&quot; (&quot;Annual&quot; #1), Tommy and Natt become involved in a power struggle in a small Texan town. The art for the annual was provided by Carlos Ezquerra and Steve Pugh. Kevin Smith provided the intro.

Vol. 3: Local Heroes
* &quot;Local Heroes&quot; (#9–12) opens with Pat Noonan&#x27;s funeral. Tiegel is kicked off the police force because she is an honest cop, unlike the corrupt Captain Burns, her former boss. He makes an enemy with CIA agent Truman, who wants him for a metahuman killing group. Detective Tiegel works with Tommy; they expose Burns.
* In &quot;Zombie Night at the Gotham Aquarium&quot; (#13–14), Tommy, Natt, Ringo and Hacken take a contract from Injun Peak to stop a scientist from re-animating dead sea creatures. As the title indicates, they fail.
* The initial 1999 paperback included the above-referenced story from the &quot;Hitman Annual&quot;.

Vol. 4: Ace of Killers
* In &quot;Ace of Killers&quot; (#15–20), the Mawzir tricks Catwoman into stealing the Ace of Winchesters, a Winchester rifle forged in the old West to kill demons. Tommy and Natt form an impromptu alliance with Catwoman (spurned over being manipulated), a surprised Tiegel and Jason Blood, the occultist expert and keeper of Etrigan the Demon. Would-be superhero Sixpack even reforms his old team Section 8 to help out. A battle in Hell and in church ends with Etrigan the de facto ruler of Hell, the Mawzir dead again and the gun in new hands (the Ace of Winchesters was previously featured during Garth Ennis&#x27;s run on &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. Jason Blood stole Etrigan&#x27;s heart, with the help of Tommy, in &quot;The Demon&quot; #54, written by Ennis).
* In &quot;Kiss Me&quot; (#21), a misunderstanding after a romantic night with Tiegel leads to Tommy killing a valued mob officer in self-defense; this incident would have long-term consequences. This issue is the only issue of the series proper not illustrated by John McCrea; the art was done by Steve Pugh.
* In &quot;The Santa Contract&quot; (#22), the Christmas story, a power plant worker mutates into a radioactive Santa. Tommy is hired to kill him.

Vol. 5: Who Dares Wins (2001)
* &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; (#23–27, epilogue in #28) involves a squad of British SAS soldiers (Captain Page, Sergeant Eddie Baker, Plug, and Whitey) assigned to kill Tommy and Natt over a Gulf Storm &quot;friendly fire&quot; incident. This correlates with &#x27;Men&#x27;s Room Louie&#x27;, a Mafia boss mad over Tommy&#x27;s self-defense killing. The SAS, who do not survive the confrontation, manage to kill off Louie; Tommy and Nat are believed to be the killers.
* The issues in this trade were included in the larger &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Heroes&quot; collection released in 2011.

Vol. 5: Tommy&#x27;s Heroes (2011)
* &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; (#23–27, epilogue in #28)
* In &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Heroes&quot; (#29–33), looking to get away from the Men&#x27;s Room Louie heat, Tommy and Natt (along with Ringo and Hacken) take a job offer in Africa. They are to train an army filled with forcibly enlisted unskilled men to fight the rebels, who are selling heroin to fund their insurgency. Tommy befriends a British Airborne soldier named Bob Mitchell who was friends with Eddie Baker (from &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;). They soon realize that President Kijaro and his superhuman bodyguards, Scarlett Rose and the Skull, are evil. They meet the rebels, and Tommy is convinced to help install their leader, Christian Ributu, in Kijaro&#x27;s place as long as he stops dealing heroin. Ributu is warned not to be like the other rulers, or Tommy will return.
* &quot;Hitman&quot; #1,000,000 was published as part of DC&#x27;s &quot;One Million&quot; crossover. Tommy is transported to the 853rd Century by some punks who believe that he was a hero and he corrects their mistaken belief quite violently. Tommy also meets the successor to fellow Bloodlines hero Gunfire.
* In &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot; (#34), a starstruck Tommy meets Superman on a Gotham rooftop. Superman has just rescued a group of astronauts, but was unable to save the final man. Everyone believes Superman will save them if need be, and he struggles under the burden of representing the power of the United States of America. Tommy tells him that the America that he represents is about the opportunity for people from all over the world to cast aside old baggage and join in the melting pot. Cheered up by the pep talk, Superman thanks Tommy and signs an autograph before flying back to Metropolis. He remains oblivious to the fact that Tommy is actually on the roof to assassinate a local criminal.
* In &quot;Katie / Father&#x27;s Day&quot; (#35–36), Tommy&#x27;s half-sister Frances comes to Gotham and explains his family history. His mother was a local prostitute who named her children after their fathers. Tom Dawson was a violent man who did not want his secrets exposed and killed her. Dawson later tracks down Frances and tortures her to death; Tommy kills Dawson in revenge.

Vol. 6: For Tomorrow (2012)
* In &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (#37–38), Tommy and his friends destroy a nearby vampire nest; he befriends a local woman named Maggie.
::* This is a crossover with the Batman arc &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. The characters discuss many of the seemingly yearly big events and how they relate to them. It also features a vampire character from past issues of &quot;Hellblazer&quot; written by Garth Ennis.
* In &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; (#39–42, epilogue in #43), Tommy tells Tiegel he loves her, and she asks if he loves her enough to quit being a hitman, theoretically. Ringo has been seeing Wendy (from the first two arcs), but she realizes he is a hitman and dumps him. Ringo is targeted by the father of a man he had killed. Tommy becomes swept up in the events; Ringo does not survive the battle. Tommy later kills the father. The arc was dedicated to John Woo and Chow Yun-fat.
* In &quot;Fresh Meat&quot; (#44–46), while at the Injun Peak scientific facility, a mistake literally leads Tommy and Natt to the time of the dinosaurs. Then a pack of &quot;T. rex&quot;es, led by the clever Scarback, come to Gotham in the modern day. Many are killed, but the rest decide to go home because the pollution made the city and its people literally distasteful.
* In &quot;The Old Dog&quot; (#47–49, epilogue in #50), men&#x27;s Room Louie&#x27;s granddaughter Isabella celebrates her wedding, and her uncle Benito Gallo (a knife-wielding Mafia hitman) offers to kill Tommy. Benito&#x27;s attempt only wounds Tommy. While recuperating, Tommy finally realizes Sean is his &#x27;true&#x27; father; having raised him all these years. A battle breaks out, with Tommy and his friends holed up in Noonan&#x27;s bar. Eventually, Benito is taken hostage. This ends badly, as Benito slips his bonds while alone with Sean and both men end up killing each other. The epilogue happens fifty years later; four friends are sightseeing through Noonan&#x27;s, because of a book based (loosely) on Tommy&#x27;s exploits. They meet an aged Hacken, who tells them that Tommy killed dozens (excepting children) at Isabella&#x27;s wedding; a brief scene shows her dead body draped over the altar. The title is the inscription that Sean has requested on his tombstone. In the end, Tommy instead puts &quot;Beloved Father&quot;.

Vol. 7: Closing Time (2012)
* &quot;Hitman/Lobo: That Stupid Bastich&quot;: In this one-shot crossover, Lobo comes to Noonan&#x27;s one night. Tommy gets in a fight with him and is pursued across town. He uses perverted blackmail to get the alien to leave him alone.
* &quot;How To Be A Super-Hero!&quot;: Around the time of #34, Ennis wrote this short story in &quot;Superman 80-Page Giant&quot; #1. Sixpack dreams that he is patrolling Metropolis, and Superman asks to tag along. Superman lectures him about the need for proof, the downside to burning prisons, and not stabbing muggers with broken bottles.
* In &quot;Super-Guy&quot; (#51–52), an Injun Peak scientist and colleague of Doctor Jackson possesses his assistant with a group of demons known as the &quot;Multi-Angled Ones&quot;. The assistant, who now has the power to literally pull any object from his rectum, goes on a rampage and Tommy and Natt are sent to deal with him. They successfully kill the assistant, only to free the Multi-Angled Ones in the process. Meanwhile, Sixpack sees the commotion and convinces a disillusioned and directionless Section 8 to rally and defeat the menace. The demons promptly slaughter most of Section 8, while gloating that nothing will stop them from turning Earth into Hell. Sixpack&#x27;s deluded bravery still impresses them, so he is challenged to a fight for his soul, with Earth&#x27;s existence on the line. Sixpack agrees, and he and the demons disappear forever afterwards; and a statue is erected in his memory. Bueno Excellente is the only presumed survivor of Section 8 from the attack (he avenges the team by sexually assaulting Doctor Jackson to death); however, a man resembling Sixpack in his civilian identity is seen at an AA meeting, seemingly at peace.
* In &quot;Closing Time&quot; (#53–60) the final story, the Mafia put a $2,000,000 contract on Tommy&#x27;s head after the wedding massacre and many would-be assassins try to collect. Tiegel&#x27;s grandfather dies, and Tommy tells her they cannot see each other any more, because he is bad for her. He gives her all the money he has saved, and she goes to New York. CIA agents in the employ of Truman (from &quot;Local Heroes&quot;) want to kill Maggie Lorenzo (from &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Land&quot;) because she saw an escaped subject of his experiment duplicate the effects of the Bloodlines incident. Maggie seeks out Tommy, and finds him at the bar. Kathryn McAllister (from &quot;Local Heroes&quot;) arrives, saying that she has left Truman&#x27;s employ over his growing paranoia regarding superhumans. She contacts her friends at the FBI who want to take Truman down, but they offer only a helicopter with very little support.
:: Truman hires Marc Navarone, the son of Johnny Navarone (from &quot;10,000 Bullets&quot;), to kill Tommy, whom he regards as a loose end. An aging policeman named Connolly (mentioned in &quot;The Old Dog&quot;) hears about the CIA plots, and kidnaps Tommy to protect him as a posthumous favor to Sean. After a few flashbacks, Natt and McAllister find Connolly&#x27;s apartment and free Tommy without killing Connolly. Tommy, Natt, and McCallister shoot up Truman&#x27;s place, slaying many of Truman&#x27;s men in the process. They are so overwhelmed by the horrors of Truman&#x27;s experiments that Marc gets the drop on Tommy, but, having never killed anyone outside of practice, he accidentally leaves the gun&#x27;s safety on. Tommy snatches the gun and shoots him.
:: Truman escapes and gathers his remaining two hundred men. McAllister picks up the helicopter and heads to Noonan&#x27;s, where Tommy and Natt share one last beer. They walk outside, and Truman&#x27;s men open fire. Tommy loses multiple fingers due to a well-placed bullet. Connolly is forced to watch, but has been forbidden to interfere by the Gotham PD brass. Natt is shot in the chest, but kills his attacker. Moments later, he falls during the run for the helicopter. He pleads with Tommy to not to leave him alive to be experimented on. McAllister tries to get Tommy to stay on the helicopter, but he runs back to defend his friend. Tommy lays down covering fire; Truman catches a bullet between the eyes and dies. Tommy is shot down by the remaining men. The series ends with a badly wounded Natt and Tommy fantasizing about a version of Noonan&#x27;s where the beer is free, no guns are allowed and all their deceased friends are alive.

===&quot;JLA/Hitman&quot; miniseries===
Clark Kent is being interviewed about Superman&#x27;s connection to notorious killer Tommy Monaghan. Taking the conversation off the record, he tells a story of how the JLA intercepted a rocket which was filled with a new strain of the Bloodlines virus. They needed a living being who had been exposed to the virus already and survived. Batman took the chance to grab Tommy, whom he regarded as a minor nuisance, killing two birds with one stone.

In the Watchtower, Batman criticizes Green Lantern for having teamed up with Tommy, until Superman walks in and is pleased to see Tommy. Batman tells Superman that Tommy is a killer, and Superman is suddenly torn, because the advice Tommy had given is still helping him. The rocket arrives at the moon. The White House, in fear of the aliens, launches nuclear weapons at the Watchtower.

The corrupted astronauts invade. Each has their own powers. The JLA soon find themselves powerless. The team mount a counterattack but, one by one, most fall. Wonder Woman sacrifices herself so Tommy can continue on. Tommy talks an infected Superman into overcoming his own alien.

Over the course of the battle, Tommy kills all the astronauts and the aliens. The nuclear attack on the Watchtower is called off.

Superman is torn, but the rest of the League are critical of Tommy&#x27;s actions. Batman has him arrested, but the cops who process him are local &#x27;Cauldron&#x27; boys and release him in lieu of gambling debts.

In the present day, Superman admits that he admires Tommy&#x27;s moral courage in the extreme situation and mourns his passing.

==Other appearances==
Prior to his own series, Hitman was introduced during Garth Ennis&#x27;s run on &quot;The Demon&quot;. After the aforementioned appearance in &quot;Annual&quot; #2, he appeared in two later arcs:
: &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hitman&quot; (#42–45) – Etrigan, newly appointed as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hitman&quot;, is at war with Lord Asteroth, an Archfiend of Hell, over the fate of Gotham. After being overwhelmed by his Choirboy Commandoes, Etrigan hires Tommy to take out Asteroth in issue #43. Tommy telepathically learns that Asteroth is sacrificing people to bring about Hell on Earth. He shoots the Choirboy Commandoes and Asteroth&#x27;s other men, but flees rather than kill police officers. Etrigan deals with the supernatural menaces, but decides not to pay Tommy for his services (this also featured the first appearance of the Master Baytor).
: &quot;Suffer the Children&quot; (#52–54) – After Jason Blood&#x27;s daughter is born, he decides to destroy Etrigan. He hires Tommy to help him, specifically guarding him against Merlin the Magician (Etrigan&#x27;s younger half-brother). Tommy only agrees because Blood promises him $2,000,000. Etrigan escapes and kidnaps the baby, and, when Merlin aids him, Tommy shoots the magician. Jason saves the baby, and Tommy defends him while he steals Etrigan&#x27;s heart, essentially neutering the demon and binding him to Jason&#x27;s will. Tommy pinches Etrigan&#x27;s cheeks, knowing Blood will not allow the demon to hurt him.

He also made an appearance in &quot;Batman Chronicles&quot; #4, building to the release of the series. The &quot;Annual&quot; and the Batman issue are included in the first trade paperback.

During Grant Morrison&#x27;s run on &quot;JLA&quot;, Tommy was briefly considered for membership. The only reason he shows up is to check out Wonder Woman with his X-ray vision, after which he turns down their offer due to low pay.

He has also appeared in the titles &quot;Azrael&quot;, &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; and &quot;Resurrection Man&quot;, none written by Garth Ennis. The majority of &quot;Sovereign Seven&quot; is considered non-canonical due to the revelation in the last issue.

He cameos in 2014&#x27;s &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #27, where Batman escapes into Noonan&#x27;s bar from the old Gotham Prohibition tunnels. In the bar Batman meets Hacken, who offers him and his prisoner a drink. Batman declines and leaves, passing pictures of all the main cast of &quot;Hitman&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Hitman&quot; won the Best New Comic (International) National Comics Award for 1997.

Dogwelder (from the team Section 8) was voted &quot;Best New Character&quot; of 1997 by the readers of &quot;Wizard&quot;.

&quot;Hitman&quot; issue #34, the Superman-starring &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;, won the 1999 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue, presented to Ennis and McCrea. Issue #1,000,000 was a part of the &quot;DC One Million&quot; storyline, which was a top vote-getter for the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; Fan Award for Favorite Story for 1999.

&quot;For Tomorrow&quot;, in issues #39–42, was a top vote-getter for the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; Fan Award for Favorite Story for 2000.

<text>Hugh Christopher Edmund Fearnley-Whittingstall (born 14 January 1965) is an English celebrity chef, television personality, journalist, food writer, and campaigner on food and environmental issues.

Fearnley-Whittingstall hosted the &quot;River Cottage&quot; series on the UK television channel Channel 4, in which audiences observe his efforts to become a self-reliant, downshifted farmer in rural England; Fearnley-Whittingstall feeds himself, his family and friends with locally produced and sourced fruits, vegetables, fish, eggs, and meat. He has also become a campaigner on issues related to food production and the environment, such as fisheries management and animal welfare.

Fearnley-Whittingstall established River Cottage HQ in Dorset in 2004, and the operation is now based at Park Farm near Axminster in Devon. An organic smallholding, HQ is also the hub for a broad range of courses and events, and home to the River Cottage Cookery School. Fearnley-Whittingstall continues to teach and host events there on a regular basis.

== Early life ==
Fearnley-Whittingstall was born in Hampstead, London, to Robert Fearnley-Whittingstall, of a landed gentry family formerly of Watford and Hawkswick, Hertfordshire, and gardener and writer Jane Margaret, daughter of Colonel John Hawdon Lascelles OBE, of the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps. He was brought up in Gloucestershire. He was educated at Summer Fields School, Eton College, and St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he read philosophy and psychology.

==Early career==
After a temporary relocation to Africa, where Fearnley-Whittingstall was considering a career in wildlife conservation, he returned to England and became a &quot;sous chef&quot; at the River Café in London. He has since said that &quot;being messy&quot; and &quot;lacking discipline&quot;, though, made him unsuitable for working in the River Café kitchen, but that he regards his time there as a period that helped shape his current career.

Following his time at the River Café, Fearnley-Whittingstall commenced freelance journalism and was published in &quot;Punch&quot;, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

== Television ==

=== TV Production ===
Co-founding the award-winning KEO Films in 1995, producers of Hugh&#x27;s War on Waste for the BBC, and the River Cottage Brand of TV programmes. KEO Films was declared Insolvent in 2021 and sold to another Television company. 

=== Early shows ===
Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s initial television exposure was on &quot;A Cook on the Wild Side&quot; (1995), an exploration of earthy cuisine. His next series was &quot;TV Dinners&quot; (1996), in one episode of which he notoriously flambéed and puréed a human placenta to then serve as &quot;pâté&quot;. In 2002, he presented the six-episode series &quot;Treats from the Edwardian Country House&quot;.

=== River Cottage ===
In 1997, Fearnley-Whittingstall moved into River Cottage, a former game-keeper&#x27;s lodge in the grounds of Slape Manor in Netherbury, Dorset, UK, which he had previously used as a weekend and holiday home. The lodge became the setting for three Channel 4 series: &quot;Escape to River Cottage&quot;, &quot;Return to River Cottage&quot;, and &quot;River Cottage Forever&quot;, all directed by Garry John Hughes. He has become a supporter of the organic movement. 

In 2004, &quot;Beyond River Cottage&quot; followed Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s progress as he set up a new business, River Cottage H.Q., on a property close to Dottery (near Bridport), Dorset, with his family. Underpinning his new enterprise is the selling of the produce cultivated on his property at the local marketplace, and audiences bear witness to the host&#x27;s experiences as a produce seller, while also intermittently receiving the recipe lessons traditionally seen on food shows. The series concludes with a Christmas special in which a feast is brought together, consisting of a 10-bird roast using Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s own geese and ducks.

In 2005, a series called &quot;The View from River Cottage&quot; was produced using extracts from the four previous series, accompanied by newly recorded narration. This was followed by &quot;River Cottage Road Trip&quot; special that consisted of two newly produced one-hour instalments. During 2006, Fearnley-Whittingstall moved River Cottage HQ from the original barn near Bridport to its new premises, Park Farm, a farm near Uplyme on the West Dorset/East Devon border. A new series called &quot;The River Cottage Treatment&quot; was filmed there and was broadcast on Channel 4 in November 2006. This premise of this series involved guests described as &quot;urban-dwellers, fast-food lovers, and convenient food-mongers&quot; to spend a week with the host on the new property, the guests being required to undertake farm duties and to eat according to the River Cottage philosophy.

In 2007, Fearnley-Whittingstall presented, &quot;River Cottage: Gone Fishing&quot;, a short series that is the concept&#x27;s 10th overall, in which he examines some of the lesser-known fish to be caught around the British Isles. From 2008, he filmed magazine-style food programmes, produced at River Cottage HQ, based on the seasonal themes. &quot;River Cottage Spring&quot; ran from 28 May 2008 to 25 June 2008 on Channel 4, and in one of the episodes, Fearnley-Whittingstall demonstrated his &quot;holistic&quot; approach to cooking by teaching a vegetarian how to slaughter, prepare, and cook lamb.

In late 2008, &quot;River Cottage Autumn&quot; was broadcast from 16 October to 6 November 2008. In one of the autumnal episodes, Fearnley-Whittingstall, together with his friend, John, embarks on a mission to catch crustaceans at a nearby beach with the use of pots. The pair seek to catch prawns, crabs and lobsters, in addition to the blue velvet swimming crab that is commonly found at the particular coastal location where they are based. On 19 October 2009, a new series of four episodes aired on Channel 4: &quot;River Cottage – Winter&#x27;s on the Way&quot;. In one of the episodes from the winter series, Fearnley-Whittingstall captures, prepares, and cooks rabbits that he finds on his property and introduces viewers to salsify; according to the host, salsify was popular during the Victorian era.

=== New River Cottage ===
In September 2010, a new series of &quot;River Cottage&quot; episodes, entitled &quot;River Cottage Every Day&quot;, commenced. The series encouraged viewers to cook from scratch more frequently and was accompanied by a book of the same name.
In autumn 2011, a new series, &quot;River Cottage Veg&quot;, was launched and is based on Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s developed awareness regarding the problematic way in which meat is produced and consumed in the modern era. During the series, the food activist addresses the challenge that he defines in the series&#x27; first episode: &quot;A whole summer without flesh&quot;. Fearnley-Whittingstall explains further: &quot;In the weeks ahead, I&#x27;ll be expanding my vegetable horizons, seeking out new flavours and textures, and cooking up a whole raft of vegetable dishes with the same excitement and gusto that I&#x27;ve always bestowed on meat and fish.&quot; A new series of River Cottage, entitled &quot;Hugh&#x27;s Three Good Things&quot;, aired on Channel 4 in December 2012. 

Accompanied by a cookbook, the series was based on the notion that a great meal can be prepared from gathering three good ingredients; in the first episode, Fearnley-Whittingstall uses beetroot, egg, and anchovies to make an open sandwich. He also competed against guest chefs in each episode and viewers were invited to challenge the television host with a superior recipe. In 2012, he presented &quot;River Cottage: Three Go Mad&quot; a three-episode series inviting various British TV personalities to River Cottage and teaching them how to cook.

===New series===
In August 2015, alongside Lindsey Chapman, he hosted a series of five daily programmes on BBC One, linked to three evening programmes &quot;Big Blue Live&quot;. The series concentrated on marine wildlife around the UK coast. 
In November 2015, Fearnley-Whittingstall presented &quot;Hugh&#x27;s War on Waste&quot; on BBC One, campaigning against waste by food producers, retailers, and consumers.

In 2018, he filmed &quot;Britain&#x27;s Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&quot;, a documentary for BBC One, where he explored the obesity crisis in Britain, asking food producers, restaurants, and the government to confront the crisis. Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s letter to the government was signed by 97,869 people; the government responded, and on 25 June, launched a new childhood obesity strategy. Also in the programme, Fearnley-Whittingstall, in partnership with Newcastle City Council, launched Newcastle Can (newcastlecan.com), an initiative and experiment aimed to encourage the citizens of Newcastle to work together to get healthier and fitter.

On 20 June 2022, a new four-part series called &quot;River Cottage Reunited&quot; premiered on More4.

===Guest appearances===

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall appeared on &quot;Celebrity Countdown&quot; in 1998; he was named by former host Richard Whiteley as the &quot;de facto&quot; champion with the highest score of the series. In 1997, he appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s Time Team live dig in Turkdean. A year later, he again joined the Time Team live dig, this time at Bawsey.

He then appeared on the first series of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The F Word&quot; in 2005, advising Gordon Ramsay on the rearing of turkeys at Ramsay&#x27;s London home; the turkeys are eaten in the last episode of the series. Further appearances on &quot;The F-Word&quot; in 2006 and 2007 involved Fearnley-Whittingstall advising Ramsay on the rearing of pigs and lambs; again, the consumption of the livestock occurs in the last episodes of the series.

At the start of 2008, Fearnley-Whittingstall – along with fellow celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Ramsay – was featured in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Food Fight&quot; season; his contribution to the season was &quot;Hugh&#x27;s Chicken Run&quot;, which was shown over three consecutive nights. He created three chicken farms in Axminster (one intensive, one commercial free-range, and the third a community farm project staffed by volunteers), culminating in a &quot;Chicken Out!&quot; campaign to encourage the eating of free-range chicken. In 2008, based on the success of the project, further discussion occurred among Channel 4 executives regarding the filming of another season.

In 2009, Fearnley-Whittingstall became a permanent team captain, opposing a different guest captain each week, on a food-based panel game, &quot;The Big Food Fight&quot;, which began on Channel 4 on 8 September; this is not to be confused with the earlier project of the same name. On 12 June, he was a guest on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; and he recorded a guest spot on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; that was broadcast on 26 July and again on 31 July 2009.

Fearnley-Whittingstall appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s satirical music panel show, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, on an episode recorded in 2008; airing was delayed until 19 January 2011, due to the scandals surrounding Russell Brand that led to his resignation from the BBC.

==Writing==
Fearnley-Whittingstall published &quot;Cuisine Bon Marché&quot; in 1994. He wrote the cookbooks, &quot;The River Cottage Year&quot;, &quot;The River Cottage Fish Book&quot; (with Nick Fisher), &quot;The River Cottage Cookbook&quot; (winner of the Andre Simon Food Book of the Year award, the Guild of Food Writers’ Michael Smith Award, and the Glenfiddich Trophy and Food Book of the Year), and &quot;The River Cottage Meat Book&quot; (the last two books with photographs by Simon Wheeler). His most recent books have been published by Bloomsbury, including &quot;River Cottage Every Day&quot; and &quot;River Cottage Veg Every Day!&quot;.

He has written articles for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; since 2001. A collection of his short articles was published in October 2006 under the title &quot;Hugh Fearlessly Eats It All: Dispatches from the Gastronomic Frontline&quot;. He edited &quot;The Big Bento Box of Unuseless Japanese Inventions&quot;, written by Kenji Kawakami.

==Activism==
In January 2008, Fearnley-Whittingstall called on hospitality and food-service operators to use less intensively farmed chicken:
It&#x27;s one thing to challenge individual consumers to give up intensively reared chicken, but it&#x27;s also an issue where anyone in the business of selling chicken has to take a stand... in some cases I know chefs, not naming names, at the very high-end sector who are not using free-range birds. Some of them are on the road to Michelin stars.

In 2012, Fearnley-Whittingstall filmed a Channel 4 series, &quot;Hugh&#x27;s Fish Fight&quot;. The series was broadcast in three parts on Channel 4. The campaign&#x27;s website said it had received over 700,000 signatures by 2012.

In November 2015, he filmed &quot;Hugh&#x27;s War on Waste&quot;. with the BBC and began a campaign to reduce consumer waste in the UK. The two programmes focused on food and clothing waste, both by supermarkets and by shoppers in their own homes.

In 2018, he filmed &quot;Britain&#x27;s Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&quot;, where he explored the obesity crisis in Britain, asking food producers, restaurants and the government to confront the crisis.

In 2021, Fearnley-Whittingstall joined the Green Party, however he tactically voted for the Liberal Democrats in the 2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election.

== Other projects ==
Fearnley-Whittingstall helped develop Stinger, a nettle-flavoured ale, with the Hall &amp; Woodhouse brewery.

Another Fearnley-Whittingstall project was the conversion of an old inn in Axminster to an organic produce shop and canteen, which opened in September 2007.

In 2009, he became a patron of ChildHope UK, an international child-protection charity working in Africa, Asia, and South America.

In 2009, &quot;The River Cottage Summer&#x27;s Here&quot; programme promoted the Landshare project that seeks to bring together people who wish to grow fruit and vegetables, but have no land, with landowners willing to donate spare land for cultivation. The online project was commissioned by Channel 4.

Fearnley-Whittingstall is a Vice-president of international wildlife conservation NGO Fauna and Flora International.

== Personal life ==
Fearnley-Whittingstall married Marie Derome in 2001; the couple live in East Devon with their four children. Fearnley-Whittingstall also runs the River Cottage Canteen and Deli in the centre of Axminster and, in 2011, launched a second River Cottage Canteen and Deli in Plymouth (since closed) and a third in Winchester (which closed in 2020).
He supports the Green Party of England and Wales.

In 2012, his barn at River Cottage was damaged by fire.

Fearnley-Whittingstall is not a vegan in his personal life. He has commented: &quot;I have not become vegan, as some are beginning to think. I still eat meat, fish and dairy products, in moderation&quot;.

An outline of his life and beliefs, with excerpts from relevant music that he has listened to during his various campaigns, was broadcast in the BBC Radio series Private Passions on Sunday 30 June 2024.

<doc id="699772" wikidata="Q2524197" url="?curid=699772" title="Star number">
<text>In mathematics, a star number is a centered figurate number, a centered hexagram (six-pointed star), such as the Star of David, or the board Chinese checkers is played on.
The &quot;n&quot;th star number is given by the formula &quot;Sn&quot; = 6&quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1) + 1. The first 45 star numbers are 1, 13, 37, 73, 121, 181, 253, 337, 433, 541, 661, 793, 937, 1093, 1261, 1441, 1633, 1837, 2053, 2281, 2521, 2773, 3037, 3313, 3601, 3901, 4213, 4537, 4873, 5221, 5581, 5953, 6337, 6733, 7141, 7561, 7993, 8437, 8893, 9361, 9841, 10333, 10837, 11353, and 11881. 

The digital root of a star number is always 1 or 4, and progresses in the sequence 1, 4, 1. The last two digits of a star number in base 10 are always 01, 13, 21, 33, 37, 41, 53, 61, 73, 81, or 93.

Unique among the star numbers is 35113, since its prime factors (i.e., 13, 37 and 73) are also consecutive star numbers.

== Relationships to other kinds of numbers ==

Geometrically, the &quot;n&quot;th star number is made up of a central point and 12 copies of the (&quot;n&quot;−1)th triangular number — making it numerically equal to the &quot;n&quot;th centered dodecagonal number, but differently arranged. As such, the formula the &quot;n&quot;th star number can be written as S_n=1+12T_n-1 where T_n=n(n+1)/2.

Infinitely many star numbers are also triangular numbers, the first four being &quot;S&quot;1 = 1 = &quot;T&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;7 = 253 = &quot;T&quot;22, &quot;S&quot;91 = 49141 = &quot;T&quot;313, and &quot;S&quot;1261 = 9533161 = &quot;T&quot;4366 .

Infinitely many star numbers are also square numbers, the first four being &quot;S&quot;1 = 12, &quot;S&quot;5 = 121 = 112, &quot;S&quot;45 = 11881 = 1092, and &quot;S&quot;441 = 1164241 = 10792 , for square stars .

A star prime is a star number that is prime. The first few star primes are
13, 37, 73, 181, 337, 433, 541, 661, 937.

A superstar prime is a star prime whose prime index is also a star number. The first two such numbers are 661 and 1750255921.

A reverse superstar prime is a star number whose index is a star prime. The first few such numbers are 937, 7993, 31537, 195481, 679393, 1122337, 1752841, 2617561, 5262193.

The term &quot;star number&quot; or &quot;stellate number&quot; is occasionally used to refer to octagonal numbers.

The alternating series of unit fractions with the star numbers as denominators is:

<doc id="699773" wikidata="Q2617855" url="?curid=699773" title="Arc System Works">
<text>, commonly referred to as ArcSys, is a Japanese video game developer and publisher located in Yokohama. Founded by Minoru Kidooka in 1988, the company is known for arcade 2D fighting game franchises, including &quot;Guilty Gear&quot; and &quot;BlazBlue&quot;, as well as other license-based fighting games for &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot;, &quot;Persona 4 Arena&quot; (&quot;Ultimax&quot;), &quot;Granblue Fantasy Versus&quot; (&quot;Rising&quot;), and others.

==History==
The company was founded in January 1988 and incorporated as Arc Co., Ltd. in May. The company spent early years as a contract developer for Sega, Sammy, and Banpresto. It consisted at the time of around eight developers; most of whom had previously worked at Sega including founder Minoru Kidooka. It was renamed Arc System Works in 1991. In 1992 they developed a game for the Famicom called &quot;Pizza Pop!&quot;. The company produced a series of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; video games for publisher Angel including &quot;Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Jōgai Rantō!? Shuyaku Sōdatsusen&quot; which was the first fighting game they produced&quot;.&quot;

They published their first title in 1995 which was &quot;Exector&quot; for the PlayStation.

On June 11, 2015, the company acquired all intellectual properties of Technōs Japan, such as &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Kunio-kun&quot;, from Million Co., Ltd. Even prior to its acquisition of Million&#x27;s library, the company had been the publisher of Technōs&#x27; video games for Virtual Console in Japan. Following the transaction, the company took the publishing duties from Aksys Games for Virtual Console releases in North America, though some Technōs games were already published by Arc System Works.

On February 6, 2017, the company acquired the rights to the &quot;Jake Hunter&quot;, &quot;Theresia&quot;, &quot;Nazo no Jikenbo&quot;, and &quot;Koneko no Ie&quot; series from publisher WorkJam. On November 2, 2017, the company announced the establishment of a North American branch in Torrance, California, known as Arc System Works America, Inc.

In July 2024, Arc System Works has opened its European branch at Paris, France.

<text>The Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada (UOCC; ; ; ) is an Eastern Orthodox church in Canada, primarily consisting of Orthodox Ukrainian Canadians. Its former name (before 1990) was the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church of Canada (UGOCC). The Church, currently a metropolis of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, is part of the wider Eastern Orthodox communion, however was created independently in 1918.

It has cathedrals in many Canadian cities, including Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, and Montreal. The Metropolitan Cathedral, seminary (St. Andrew&#x27;s College), and central administrative office are all based in Winnipeg. Also the church is affiliated with four residences for university students: St. Volodymyr Institute in Toronto, Ontario; St. Petro Mohyla Institute in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; St. John&#x27;s Institute in Edmonton, Alberta; and one operating at St. Andrew&#x27;s College. The church&#x27;s membership is about ten thousand. The current Primate of the church is Metropolitan Ilarion (Rudnyk).

==History ==
Most ethnic Ukrainians moving to Canada from Galicia and Lodomeria (Austria-Hungary) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were Greek Catholics (Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church), and were tended early on by the local Roman Catholic hierarchy until the creation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Exarchate in 1912. This was because the North American Roman Catholic bishops believed that the presence of married Eastern Catholic priests would create a scandal at the time. The other major group of Ukrainians which were coming to Canada were from Bukovina, and they were mostly Orthodox belonging to the Metropolitan of Bukovina and Dalmatia (autonomous church in Austria-Hungary). At first these Orthodox Christians were served by the Russian Orthodox Mission in North America (which at that time was part of the bigger Russian Orthodox Church), but these services were not conducted in their native Ukrainian language. 

Catholics and the Orthodox who wanted to establish their own church met in the summer of 1918 in the city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and established the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada. Also at these meetings, the delegates (mostly from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) had established a Brotherhood to try to help the young church.

The settlers had just created a new church, but they were very conscious of Church Canon Law that states that a church cannot exist without a bishop. The church&#x27;s brotherhood tried to have Archbishop Alexander Nemolovsky of the Russian Orthodox Mission to take the church under his temporary care as bishop. At first Archbishop Alexander agreed, but later declined; however, the UGOC&#x27;s First Sobor (Church Assembly) still took place as planned on December 28, 1918 in Saskatoon. This Sobor led to the establishment of the church&#x27;s first seminary in Saskatoon. The Brotherhood still searched for a temporary bishop, and eventually found one: Metropolitan Germanos (Shehadi), who was the Metropolitan of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. He led the church for the next 5 years (1919-1924). Under his supervision, Second Sobor took place in Saskatoon on November 27, 1919.

=== Archbishop John (Theodorovich) ===
Following Metropolitan Germanos&#x27; leadership, Archbishop John (Theodorovich) became the church&#x27;s primate. Archbishop John had just arrived in the United States from Ukraine (Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic) where was revived the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church for the first time since the partitions of Poland. The revived church in Ukraine was recognized as &quot;non-canonical&quot;. Nonetheless, Archbishop John (Theodorovich) began to serve the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA to become their Primate and Metropolitan. The young church had chosen the Ukrainian bishop as their bishop, hoping that the church would further grow under his leadership. During the summers from 1924 to 1946 Archbishop John would make an annual trip to Canada to visit the parishes throughout the country. When Archbishop John was in the USA during the winter months, a Fr. Semen Sawchuk would act as an administrator at the Consistory in Canada.

After a few years as acting Primate of the UOCC, certain controversies laid around Archbishop John, due to his uncanonical ordination to bishop. Archbishop John was &quot;ordained&quot; by the &quot;bishops&quot; of Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, who were not ordained according to the canon laws and traditions of the Orthodox Church, but were ordained by assemblies of priests and lay people and thus breaching the concept of apostolic succession. The 1st Canon of the Holy Apostles states that new bishops should be ordained by at least 2 or 3 bishops. In an argument, ordination of bishops of the revived Ukrainian church of 1921 was decided to carry out by a church assembly (Sobor), which is similar to congregational churches. As a result of this, Archbishop John resigned his position as ruling bishop in 1946.

At a special Sobor in 1947, Bishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) was accepted as the new &quot;Archbishop of Winnipeg and all Canada&quot;. However, due to some misunderstandings, and arguments about how the church should be governed (mostly between himself and Semen Sawchuk), he resigned as Primate in 1950 at X Sobor in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In response the UOCC contacted Metropolitan Polycarp (Sikorski) (who was the head of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church Abroad, composed of refugee bishops formerly affiliated with the Polish Orthodox Church in German-occupied Ukraine) for assistance, and he agreed to send some bishops over to help the faithful in Canada.

===Formation of the Metropolia===
At a special sobor in 1947 the UGOCC accepted Bishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) of Pereyaslav of the UAOC, consecrated during World War II with the blessing of Metropolitan Dionysius (Waledyński) of Warsaw, as its ruling bishop with the title &quot;Archbishop of Winnipeg and All Canada&quot;. Due to conflicts between Archbishop Mstyslav and members of the UGOCC Consistory, however, the former resigned as diocesan bishop at the tenth sobor of the Church in 1950, once again leaving the UGOCC without a bishop.

After the resignation of Archbishop Mstyslav the Consistory appealed to Metropolitan Polycarp of the UAOC for assistance in finding bishops for the UGOCC. By the time another special sobor was called in 1951 four potential bishops, all consecrated in German-occupied Ukraine during World War II, had been found. One, Metropolitan Hilarion (Ohienko) of Kholm, had been resident in Winnipeg since 1947. Two others, Archbishop Michael (Khoroshy) and Bishop Platon (Artemiuk), came to Canada at the invitation of the Consistory and with the blessing of Metropolitan Polycarp.

At the 1951 sobor it was decided that the UGOCC, which had grown to include some 300 parishes, would be organized as a metropolia. Metropolitan Ilarion was elected Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada and primate of the UGOCC, while Archbishop Michael was elected Archbishop of Toronto and Eastern Canada. (Bishop Platon had died shortly after his arrival in Canada.) The size of the UGOCC necessitated the appointment of more bishops, and so in 1959 Archimandrite Andrew (Metiuk) was elected Bishop of Edmonton and Western Canada and in 1963 Archimandrite Boris (Yakovkevych) was elected Bishop of Saskatoon and auxiliary or assistant bishop of the Central Eparchy under Metropolitan Ilarion.

After 21 years as primate of the UGOCC, Metropolitan Ilarion died on March 29, 1972, and was succeeded by Archbishop Michael of Toronto as Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada. After Metropolitan Michael&#x27;s retirement in 1975 Archbishop Andrew (Metiuk) was elected metropolitan, serving until his death on February 2, 1985. Under Metropolitan Andrew new bishops, Bishops Mikolaj (Debryn), Basil (Fedak), and John (Stinka), were elected to serve the UGOCC, and after Metropolitan Andrew&#x27;s death Bishop Wasyly was elected Metropolitan of Winnipeg and All Canada. Four years after his enthronement as primate of the UGOCC Metropolitan Wasyly consecrated Archimandrite Yurij (Kalistchuk) as Bishop of Saskatoon.

Since 1960 the UOCC has been in spiritual union with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.

===Recent history===
After dialoguing with the Church of Constantinople the UGOCC was received into its jurisdiction as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada in 1990, bringing it into the full communion of the canonical Orthodox Church. (Several years later its sister church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Diaspora, also joined the Patriarchate of Constantinople.) The decree of Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrius (Papadopoulos) uniting the UOCC with the Church of Constantinople recognized the Church&#x27;s internal autonomy under its metropolitan, justifying the reception of the UOCC into the Patriarchate&#x27;s jurisdiction on the basis of the historic jurisdiction of the Church of Constantinople in Ukraine.

Following the death of Metropolitan Wasyly in early 2005 the twenty-first sobor of the UOCC elected Archbishop John as Metropolitan of Winnipeg and Canada. In August 2008 an extraordinary sobor was held in Saskatoon to elect new bishops, amend the UOCC&#x27;s bylaws, and mark the 90th anniversary of the founding of the UOCC in the city. The sobor elected Bishops Ilarion (Rudnyk) of Telmessos as Bishop of Edmonton and Andriy (Peshko) of Krateia as auxiliary Bishop of Saskatoon.

In July 2010 another special sobor of the UOCC was held to nominate a successor to the newly retired Metropolitan John. The sobor nominated Archbishop Yurij (Kalistchuk) of Toronto for the metropolitanate, and consequently on August 30, 2010, the Holy Synod in Constantinople elected Archbishop Yurij as Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of Canada.

In April 2022, just after the start of the Ukraine invasion, an agreement was formalized whereby the UOCC could send aid to Ukraine via the Orthodox Church of Ukraine directly.

After a year of deliberation, the UOCC began the use of the Revised Julian Calendar on 20 December 2023, following the same decision recently made by the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and now matching the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

==Structure==
The UOCC is divided into three eparchies or dioceses, the Eastern Eparchy, with its cathedral in Toronto, Ontario; the Central Eparchy, with its cathedral in Winnipeg, Manitoba; and the Western Eparchy, with its cathedral in Edmonton, Alberta. According to the custom of the UOCC the Church&#x27;s primate is the titled the &quot;Archbishop of Winnipeg and Metropolitan of Canada&quot; and serves as the diocesan or ruling bishop of the Central Eparchy.

The Eastern Eparchy is led by Bishop Andriy (Peshko) of Toronto. The Western Eparchy is led by Bishop Ilarion (Rudnyk) of Edmonton and Western Canada. All of the UOCC&#x27;s dioceses may have auxiliary bishops (titled &#x27;Bishop of Vancouver&#x27; in the Western Eparchy, &#x27;Bishop of Saskatoon&#x27; in the Central Eparchy and &#x27;Bishop of Montreal&#x27; in the Eastern Eparchy), but none of the Eparchies have an auxiliary bishop at this time.

<text>The MGM Grand Las Vegas is a hotel and casino located on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned by Vici Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International. The resort was developed by Kirk Kerkorian through his company, MGM Grand, Inc. Kerkorian had previously developed another MGM Grand, opened on the Strip in 1973 and renamed Bally&#x27;s in 1986.

Planning began in 1989 for the new MGM Grand. The resort opened on December 18, 1993. With more than 5,000 rooms, it was the largest hotel in the world at the time of its opening. Much of the hotel is 30 stories, excluding a 14-story section, which originally opened as the Marina Hotel in 1975. The MGM Grand includes a casino, the world&#x27;s largest at the time of opening. The resort&#x27;s dominant theme was the 1939 MGM film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, although such theming would be removed during a two-year renovation that began in 1996.

The MGM originally opened with a theme park, MGM Grand Adventures, which operated on northeast of the resort. The total cost for the MGM Grand and its theme park was $1 billion. MGM Grand Adventures closed in 2000, with the property replaced by The Signature at MGM Grand, a condo hotel; and a Topgolf attraction.

The MGM has featured restaurants from several prominent chefs, including Emeril Lagasse, Michael Mina, and Joël Robuchon. From 1997 to 2012, it also included Studio 54, a nightclub featuring memorabilia from the original Studio 54 in New York. The resort has several entertainment venues, including the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Longtime shows at the resort have included &quot;Kà&quot; and magician David Copperfield.

==History==
The property was originally the site of the Tropicana Country Club and the Golf Club Motel, both opened in the 1960s.

===Marina (1975–1990)===
Tom Wiesner, a Clark County Commissioner, co-founded Southwest Securities Development Company in 1972, and later founded Wiesner Investment Company. In November 1973, Southwest Securities was planning the Marina Hotel. It would be next to the Golf Club, which itself would receive a renovation. The Marina was built by Wiesner Investment Company, and opened on May 1, 1975.

The Marina was 14 stories, and contained 714 rooms, as well as a casino, two restaurants, and an entertainment lounge. The casino portion was initially operated by Allen Glick through his company, Argent Corporation. Fred Harvey Company served as operator of the hotel, its restaurants, and other areas of the property. Fred Harvey had previously opened other Marina-branded hotels in the U.S. Meanwhile, the adjacent Golf Club Motel later operated as the Mariner, before being demolished in 1986 to become a parking lot for the larger Marina.

The Marina faced financial problems in February 1987, owing $700,000 to the Internal Revenue Service. Landlord Southwest Securities also filed a writ of attachment, seeking $393,000 in back rent from the resort&#x27;s operators. The Marina filed for bankruptcy in March 1987, and gaming was briefly shut down the following month, after the casino cage bankroll fell below $256,000, a minimum set by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

In 1989, Wiesner and his partners agreed to sell the Marina to Kirk Kerkorian, through his company MGM Grand, Inc. Also purchased was the Tropicana Country Club, located behind the Marina. Kerkorian announced plans to construct the MGM Grand Hotel and Theme Park on the parcels. The project was part of ongoing efforts to make Las Vegas a family friendly tourist destination. An earlier MGM Grand had been opened by Kerkorian in 1973, at the center of the Las Vegas Strip; it was rebranded as Bally&#x27;s in 1986. The present MGM is located near the southern end of the Strip, at the Tropicana – Las Vegas Boulevard intersection.

Kerkorian&#x27;s $80 million purchase of the Marina was completed in January 1990. The hotel structure was remodeled and briefly operated as the MGM Marina. The Tropicana Country Club closed later that year, followed by the MGM Marina on November 30, 1990, both making way for the MGM Grand. The Marina was incorporated into the MGM, becoming its West Wing.

===MGM Grand (1993–present)===
A groundbreaking ceremony for the MGM Grand, heavily inspired by the resort&#x27;s &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; theme, was held on October 7, 1991. A topping off ceremony followed on February 23, 1993. Casino executive Clifford S. Perlman was named to oversee the resort and theme park, the latter known as MGM Grand Adventures. The MGM Grand and its theme park occupied , and cost a total of $1 billion to build.
The MGM Grand opened to the public on the morning of December 18, 1993, following a private VIP party for 3,000 guests the night before. The opening came three months earlier than initially planned, as construction proceeded ahead of schedule. The MGM employed 8,000 people. A 251-foot-high sign was added along the Strip shortly after the resort&#x27;s opening, and was among the biggest signs in Las Vegas. A monorail opened in 1995, connecting the MGM Grand with Bally&#x27;s. It served as a forerunner to the Las Vegas Monorail. In 1996, the MGM Grand received a four-star rating from Mobil Travel Guide.

Rapper Tupac Shakur visited the MGM shortly before his murder in 1996. He attended the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match at the resort, and subsequently got into a fight with gang member Orlando Anderson in the hotel lobby, before being shot later that night just off the Strip.

In mid-1996, MGM Grand, Inc. began a 30-month, four-phase renovation of the resort. Terrence Lanni, the chairman of MGM Grand, Inc., said he wanted customers to &quot;feel like guests coming to a premiere of one of the world&#x27;s greatest movies. When we&#x27;re completed, every aspect of this property will bespeak entertainment.&quot; Much of the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; theming was removed during the renovation, and revenue improved substantially. As the resort marked its 10th anniversary, additional renovation work was underway to help it compete against the nearby Mandalay Bay. A $160 million hotel renovation took place from 2011 to 2012, marking the first makeover for the rooms in more than a decade. The West Wing was renamed the Studio Tower in 2022, following renovations.

In January 2020, MGM Resorts announced that it would sell the resort to a joint venture consisting of MGM Growth Properties and The Blackstone Group. MGM Growth would own 50.1 percent of the joint venture, and Blackstone would own the remainder. The MGM Grand would be leased to MGM Resorts, which would continue to operate the resort. The deal was finalized a month later. Vici Properties bought MGM Growth in April 2022, and then bought out Blackstone&#x27;s stake in the MGM Grand in January 2023.

==Features==

Veldon Simpson was the MGM&#x27;s architect, while the original interior design was handled by Henry Conversano &amp; Associates, and Miller &amp; Jedrziewski Associates.

===Hotel and casino===
The MGM contains 5,044 rooms; its hotel towers rise up to 30 stories, while the original western wing remains a 14-story structure. The MGM originally opened with 5,005 rooms; by room count, this made it the largest hotel in the world, beating the Rossiya Hotel in Russia. It remains the largest hotel in the U.S.

Upon opening, the resort also included the world&#x27;s largest casino, measuring . It featured 3,500 slot machines and 165 table games. The casino floor was divided into four themed areas, including the Emerald City Casino, themed after the eponymous fictional locale in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. This area featured costumed performers and animatronics depicting characters from the film. The entry featured a seven-story dome with a ceiling that switched between day and night; and a 15-minute magic show known as &quot;The Wizard&#x27;s Secret&quot;, which incorporated a hydraulic moving floor. Other themed gaming areas included the Hollywood Casino, featuring a Hollywood movie theme; the Monte Carlo Casino, focused on high rollers; and the Sports Casino, which included the property&#x27;s sportsbook.
Hotel rooms were also divided into themes, including Casablanca, Hollywood, and southern American. &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; served as the primary hotel theme. The hotel&#x27;s exterior consists of green glass panels, originally meant to evoke Emerald City. Blair Kamin, architecture critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, considered the movie and &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; themes poorly integrated, and wrote that the resort exterior &quot;resembles a bland suburban office building with a cartoonish lion&#x27;s face stuck on the front.&quot; Kamin also was critical of the property&#x27;s size, calling it &quot;so overwhelming and, occasionally, so confusing, that they hand out a map of the hotel-casino at the front door.&quot;

The casino opened with 50 Lion&#x27;s Share slot machines, offering a jackpot of more than $2 million. Only one of the machines remained after several years, gaining a cult following among gamblers. It was the most popular slot machine at the casino. A New Hampshire couple eventually won the jackpot in 2014, after which the machine was retired.

In 2000, the hotel launched a satellite registration and reservations desk at McCarran International Airport. It was the first Las Vegas resort, along with New York-New York across the street, to offer such a feature.
The Mansion, a secluded area of private suites and villas reserved for high rollers, opened in May 1999. It was inspired by Tuscany architecture. The Mansion&#x27;s villas and dining were opened to the public two years later.

In 2001, the MGM Grand led an effort to legalize private casinos, which are closed off to the general public. The Nevada Legislature agreed to change state law, allowing the operation of private gaming salons for players with at least $500,000 to spend and willing to bet $500 minimums. In August 2002, the MGM Grand became the first Nevada casino to offer a private gaming salon. However, demand for such a feature turned out to be extremely low.

In 2005, the hotel unveiled its Skylofts at MGM Grand, consisting of 51 units occupying the top two floors. The units were designed by Tony Chi to resemble urban apartments and are meant for wealthy guests. A trio of condo hotel towers, known as The Signature at MGM Grand, began opening in 2006.

===Facade===

The MGM&#x27;s original facade along the Strip consisted of a giant lion head, made of fiberglass and blocky in appearance, with visitors entering beneath the lion&#x27;s closed mouth. Measuring 88 feet in height, the lion was a cartoon-like version of MGM&#x27;s logo, Leo the Lion. Because of its design, Asian gamblers reportedly perceived the facade as if they were entering through the lion&#x27;s mouth, which is considered bad luck in Chinese culture. As a result, plans were announced in May 1996 to remove the lion entrance. Demolition began on May 13, 1997, and was expected to take two weeks, with a new $40 million facade taking its place.
The new facade consists of a lion statue. It weighs 50 tons, and at tall, on a 25-foot pedestal, is the largest bronze statue in the U.S. It was designed by Snellen Johnson, and created through his Arizona company American Art. Johnson initially worked with a team of 11 people to sculpt a foam mold, which would be used to create the statue.

In November 1997, the property installed 18 promotional and entertainment LED screens, including 15 outside the resort. Installation of the statue was underway a month later, with the addition of a 5,000-pound paw. The new facade also includes 11 statues of winged Atlas-like men holding 16-foot diameter bowls. The statues were made of bronze-finished fiberglass and accompany the lion statue, along with water fountains and the LED screens. Work on the statue and accompanying fountains was expected to conclude in February 1998.
===Restaurants and nightlife===
The MGM Grand opened with eight restaurants, including the 1,000-seat Oz Buffet, the 750-seat movie-themed Studio Cafe, and a restaurant by chef Wolfgang Puck. The property also featured a food court with seven additional eateries. Emeril&#x27;s New Orleans Fish House opened in 1995, marking the first Las Vegas restaurant for chef Emeril Lagasse. A Rainforest Cafe opened at the resort in 1997, and operated until 2015.

The MGM added several new restaurants in the early 2000s, including Craftsteak by chef Tom Colicchio, and Nob Hill by chef Michael Mina. Also added was a Chinese restaurant known as Pearl, and the Italian restaurant Fiamma Trattoria, the latter by chefs Michael White and Anthony Amoroso. Pearl was replaced in 2018 by China Tang, which closed two years later. Fiamma was replaced by a new Italian restaurant, Ambra, in 2019.
Chef Joël Robuchon opened two restaurants at the Mansion in 2005, including L&#x27;Atelier de Joël Robuchon and the eponymous Joël Robuchon. The latter has won numerous accolades from Mobil Travel Guide and American Automobile Association.
Shibuya, opened in 2004, was the resort&#x27;s Japanese restaurant. It was replaced when chef Masaharu Morimoto made his Las Vegas debut with Morimoto, a Japanese restaurant opened in 2016. Three years later, Mina and chef Ayesha Curry partnered to open International Smoke, featuring cuisine from around the world, including barbecue. It was the fourth International Smoke location to open since the chain&#x27;s inception earlier that year.

In 2022, the Jonas Brothers and their family members opened Nellie&#x27;s Southern Kitchen, named after a great-grandmother. It was the second location to open, following a North Carolina debut six years earlier. Luchini, an Italian restaurant, debuted in 2023. It is accompanied by Chez Bippy, named after a fictional bar featured in the 1993 film &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;.

During the 1990s, the casino included the Betty Boop Bar, which featured an animatronic of comedian Foster Brooks that recreated his drunken humor. It was removed after a few years due to poor aging. A nightclub, Studio 54, opened at the MGM in December 1997. It featured memorabilia from the original Studio 54 in New York. The Las Vegas location closed in February 2012, and much of its interior decor sat in an MGM parking garage for the next three years, before being purchased by two local collectors. The former Studio 54 space was replaced by a nightclub and restaurant known as Hakkasan, which opened in April 2013. Another nightclub, Tabu Ultra Lounge, opened in 2003, and had capacity for 340 people. It closed in 2013, and was replaced by a whiskey bar. Netflix began construction for a one-year Netflix Bites residency based on its 2023 pop-up restaurant of the same name, which featured chefs from the broadcaster&#x27;s streaming line-up, such as Dominique Crenn, Ming Tsai, and Andrew Zimmern. The new venue is slated to open in 2025.

===Other features===

Upon opening, the MGM included family friendly attractions such as the Oz Arcade, offering more than 150 games; and the Oz Midway, with 30 midway games. The theme park, MGM Grand Adventures, opened on located northeast of the resort. It closed to the public in 2000, and was briefly used thereafter for corporate and special events. Some of the former theme park land would later be taken over by the Signature towers. Topgolf opened one of its driving ranges on the remaining acreage in 2016.

The MGM opened a conference center in April 1998. The facility, as well as a pool and spa, were constructed on 15 acres of land previously occupied by a portion of the theme park and a parking lot. An expansion of the conference center began in June 2017, and was opened in January 2019. It was built at a cost of $130 million.

An indoor lion habitat opened at the resort as a free attraction on July 1, 1999. The $9 million enclosure measured and featured several glass walls for viewing, as well as a see-through tunnel. The habitat consisted of more than 40 lions who were rotated out on a daily basis for viewing. The lions were owned by animal trainer Keith Evans and lived at his ranch outside Las Vegas. As part of ongoing renovation work, the habitat closed on January 31, 2012. It was replaced by a sports bar.

The 1996–1998 renovation added a retail and restaurant area known as the Studio Walk, featuring a Hollywood sound stage theme. In 2013, the Studio Walk was rebranded as The District. A separate, underground retail area was known originally as the Starlane Mall, before being renamed MGM Underground in 2012.

In April 2001, CBS opened Television City, a television research facility located in the Studio Walk. An exhibit, , opened at the Studio Walk in 2009. It was a paid attraction based on the television series &quot;&quot;. Visitors would tour the exhibit, analyzing faux crime scenes and evidence to solve murder cases. The attraction closed in 2020, due to the local effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The MGM opened with a pool complex. Wet Republic, a popular dayclub by Hakkasan, has operated at the pool area since 2008. Level Up, a video game lounge also by Hakkasan, opened in 2016, taking over the former Rainforest Cafe space.

==Live entertainment==

The resort originally included the 15,200-seat MGM Grand Garden Arena, in addition to the 1,700-seat Grand Theatre and the 630-seat Hollywood Theatre.

A production show, &quot;EFX&quot;, ran at the resort from 1995 to 2002. It was headlined by several different entertainers during its run, including Michael Crawford, David Cassidy, Tommy Tune, and Rick Springfield.

In 1999, the resort debuted a version of the American game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Audience members were allowed to participate and potentially win money. The show had ended by 2001. It took place in a 400-seat venue previously home to Catch a Rising Star, a chain of comedy clubs.
Magician David Copperfield has been a longtime performer at the MGM, entertaining there since 2000. &quot;Kà&quot;, a show by Cirque du Soleil, has been performed at the resort since 2005. It takes place in a custom-built theater seating nearly 2,000 people.

In 2001, the resort launched &quot;La Femme&quot;, a topless show that recreated the Parisian cabaret known as Crazy Horse. The producers chose the name &quot;La Femme&quot; as Las Vegas already had a strip club known as Crazy Horse Too, which filed a lawsuit regarding the name rights. The show eventually took on the &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; name in 2007, before closing in 2012. A year later, Jeff Beacher opened his &quot;Beacher&#x27;s Madhouse&quot; show in the former &quot;Crazy Horse&quot; venue. The Jabbawockeez dance group opened in the space in 2015, and is contracted to perform there through 2025.

Brad Garrett&#x27;s Comedy Club opened in March 2012, with seating for 283 people. It was originally located in the MGM Underground area. The club has hosted numerous comedians, including Garrett himself. In 2022, the club moved to a better location at The District, taking over the former China Tang restaurant space. Although the new location sat in a higher-traffic area, seating was reduced to 210.
