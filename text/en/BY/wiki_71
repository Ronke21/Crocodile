<text>Online banking, also known as internet banking, virtual banking, web banking or home banking, is a system that enables customers of a bank or other financial institution to conduct a range of financial transactions through the financial institution&#x27;s website or mobile app. Since the early 2010s, this has become the most common way that customers access their bank accounts.

The online banking system will typically connect to or be part of the core banking system operated by a bank to provide customers access to banking services in addition to or in place of historic branch banking. Online banking significantly reduces the banks&#x27; operating cost by reducing reliance on a physical branch network and offers convenience to some customers by lessening the need to visit a bank branch as well as being able to perform banking transactions even when branches are closed, for example outside the conventional banking hours or at weekends and on holidays. 

Internet banking provides personal and corporate banking services offering features such as making electronic payments, viewing account balances, obtaining statements, checking recent transactions and transferring money between accounts.

Some banks operate as a &quot;direct bank&quot; or &quot;neobank&quot; that operate entirely via the internet or internet and telephone without having any physical branches relying completely on their online banking facilities.

==History==
===Precursors===
The precursor to the modern online banking services was distance banking electronically and by telephone since the early 1980s. The term &#x27;online&#x27; became popular in the late 1980s and referred to the use of a terminal, keyboard, and TV or monitor to access the banking system using a phone line. &#x27;Home banking&#x27; can also refer to the use of a numeric keypad to send tones down a phone line with instructions to the bank.

=== Emergence of computer banking ===

The first home banking service was offered to consumers in December 1980 by United American Bank, a community bank with headquarters in Knoxville, Tennessee. United American partnered with Radio Shack to produce a secure custom modem for its TRS-80 computer that allowed bank customers to access their account information securely. Services available in its first years included bill pay, account balance checks, and loan applications, as well as game access, budget and tax calculators and daily newspapers. Thousands of customers paid $25–30 per month for the service.

Large banks, many working on parallel tracks to United American, followed in 1981 when four of New York&#x27;s major banks (Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank, and Manufacturers Hanover) offered home banking services, using the videotex system. Because of the commercial failure of videotex, these banking services never became popular except in France (where millions of videotex terminals (Minitel) where given out by the telecom provider) and the UK, where the Prestel system was used.

The first videotext banking service in France was launched on December 20, 1983, by CCF Bank (now part of HSBC). Videotext online Banking services eventually reached 19% market share by 1991

The developers of United American Bank&#x27;s first-to-market computer banking system aimed to license it nationally, but they were overtaken by competitors when United American failed in 1983 as a result of loan fraud on the part of bank owner Jake Butcher, the 1978 Tennessee Democratic nominee for governor and promoter of the 1982 Knoxville World&#x27;s Fair. First Tennessee Bank, which purchased the failed bank, did not attempt to develop or commercialize the computer banking platform.

===Internet and customer reluctance and banking===
When the clicks-and-bricks euphoria hit in the late 1990s, many banks began to view web-based banking as a strategic imperative. In 1996 OP Financial Group, a cooperative bank, became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe. The attraction of online banking is fairly obvious: diminished transaction costs, easier integration of services, interactive marketing capabilities, and other benefits that boost customer lists and profit margins. Additionally, online banking services allow institutions to bundle more services into single packages, thereby luring customers and minimizing overhead.

In 1995, Wells Fargo was the first U.S. bank to add account services to its website, with other banks quickly following suit. That same year, Presidential became the first U.S. bank to open bank accounts over the internet. According to research by Online Banking Report, at the end of 1999 less than 0.4% of households in the U.S. were using online banking. At the beginning of 2004, some 33 million U.S. households (31%) were using some form of online banking. Five years later, 47% of Americans used online banking, according to a survey by Gartner Group. Meanwhile, in the UK online banking grew from 63% to 70% of internet users between 2011 and 2012.

By 2018, the number of digital banking users in the U.S. reached approximately 61 percent. The penetration of online banking in Europe has been increased as well. In 2019, 93 percent of the Norwegian population access online banking sites, which is the highest in Europe, followed by Denmark and Netherlands. Across Asia, more than 700 million consumers are estimated to use digital banking regularly, according to a 2015 survey by McKinsey and Company.

By 2000, 80% of U.S. banks offered e-banking. Customer use grew slowly. At Bank of America, for example, it took 10 years to acquire 2 million e-banking customers. However, a significant cultural change took place after the Y2K scare ended.

In 2001, Bank of America became the first bank to top 3 million online banking customers, more than 20% of its customer base. In comparison, larger national institutions, such as Citigroup claimed 2.2 million online relationships globally, while J.P. Morgan Chase estimated it had more than 750,000 online banking customers. Wells Fargo had 2.5 million online banking customers, including small businesses. Online customers proved more loyal and profitable than regular customers. In October 2001, Bank of America customers executed a record 3.1 million electronic bill payments, totaling more than $1 billion. As of 2017, the bank has 34 million active digital accounts, both online and mobile. In 2009, a report by Gartner Group estimated that 47% of United States adults and 30% in the United Kingdom bank online.

The early 2000s saw the rise of the branch-less banks as internet only institutions. These internet-based banks incur lower overhead costs than their brick-and-mortar counterparts. In the United States, deposits at some direct banks are FDIC-insured and offer the same level of insurance protection as traditional banks. Neobanks are branch-less banks in the United States which are not FDIC-insured.

===First online banking services by region===
====The United Kingdom====
Online banking started in the United Kingdom with the launch of Nottingham Building Society (NBS)&#x27;s Homelink service in September 1982, initially on a restricted basis, before it was expanded nationally in 1983. Homelink was delivered through a partnership with the Bank of Scotland and British Telecom&#x27;s Prestel service. The system used Prestel viewlink system and a computer, such as the BBC Micro, or keyboard (Tandata Td1400) connected to the telephone system and television set. The system allowed users to &quot;transfer money between accounts, pay bills and arrange loans... compare prices and order goods from a few major retailers, check local restaurant menus or real estate listings, arrange vacations... enter bids in Homelink&#x27;s regular auctions and send electronic mail to other Homelink users.&quot; In order to make bank transfers and bill payments, a written instruction giving details of the intended recipient had to be sent to the NBS who set the details up on the Homelink system. Typical recipients were gas, electricity and telephone companies and accounts with other banks. Details of payments to be made were input into the NBS system by the account holder via Prestel. A cheque was then sent by NBS to the payee and an advice giving details of the payment was sent to the account holder. BACS was later used to transfer the payment directly.

====The United States====
In the United States in-home banking was &quot;is still in its infancy&quot; with banks &quot;cautiously testing consumer interest&quot; in 1984, a year after online banking went national in the UK. At the time Chemical Bank in New York was &quot;still working out the bugs from its service, which offers somewhat limited features&quot;. The service from Chemical, called Pronto, was launched in 1983 and was aimed at individuals and small businesses. It enabled them to maintain electronic checkbook registers, see account balances, and transfer funds between checking and savings accounts. The other three major banks — Citibank, Chase Bank and Manufacturers Hanover — started to offer home banking services soon after. Chemical&#x27;s Pronto failed to attract enough customers to break even and was abandoned in 1989. Other banks had a similar experience.

Since it first appeared in the United States, online banking has been federally governed by the &quot;Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978&quot;.

====France====
After a test period with 2,500 users starting in 1984, online banking services were launched in 1988, using Minitel terminals that were distributed freely to the population by the government. By 1990, 6.5 million Minitels were installed in households. Online banking was one of the most popular services.

Online banking services later migrated to the Internet.

==== Japan ====
In January 1997, the first online banking service was launched by Sumitomo Bank. By 2010, most major banks implemented online banking services, however, the types of services offered varied. According to a poll conducted by Japanese Bankers Association (JBA) in 2012, 65.2% were the users of personal internet banking.

==== China ====
In January 2015, WeBank, the online bank created by Tencent, started 4-month-long online banking trail operation.

==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, the term &quot;virtual bank&quot; usually excludes the internet banking or online banking (often termed &quot;eBanking&quot;, &quot;iBanking&quot;, etc) services provided by traditional banks which serve primarily via physical branches. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority defines &quot;virtual bank&quot; as a bank which primarily delivers retail banking services through the internet or other forms of electronic channels instead of physical branches. The first virtual banking license in Hong Kong was issued in 2018. Virtual banks are subject to the same set of supervisory requirements applicable to conventional banks and are members of the Deposit Protection Scheme (DPS). By 2024, there are 8 virtual banks in the city (including ZA, Mox, Livi, PAO, Airstar, WeLab, Fusion, Ant), most of which are financially backed by larger corporations. 

==== Australia ====
In December 1995, Advance Bank acquired by St.George Bank, started to provide customers with online banking with the rollout of the C++ Internet banking program.

==== India ====
In 1998, ICICI Bank introduced internet banking to its customers. India&#x27;s online banking system includes the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real-time Gross Settlement (RTGS), which are overseen by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), which is run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

==== Brazil ====
In 1996, Banco Original SA launched its online-only retail banking. In 2019 new banks began to emerge as the Conta Simples, focused only for companies.

==== Slovenia ====
Virtual or online banking became a reality in Slovenia in 1997, when SKB bank launched this service under the name of SKB Net. Two years later, they were followed by the largest Slovenian bank, NLB bank, who started offering online banking services in 1999 under the name of NLB Klik. Nowadays, actually every bank in Slovenia is offering online banking services. The Slovenian Central bank&#x27;s data shows that there was a rise of 5,1% in 2017 from the previous year and the number almost doubled from more than ten years ago. At the end of 2019, the number of users was almost 1 million. The number of payments is around 26 million per quarter, which means that there are more than 100 million payments made online in Slovenia every year, and another 3 million made to offshore accounts. Data from the Slovenian Central bank also show that the total value of payments in 2017 reached more than €240 million. More than 900,000 use online banking in Slovenia

==== Canada ====
Virtual banking first became a possibility in 1996 with the Bank of Montreal&#x27;s mbanx. mbanx was released at the very beginning of the internet banking revolution in Canada and was the first full-service online bank Also in 1996, RBC started providing banking information online and had the first personal computer banking software released that year

In 1997, the bank ING Direct Canada (now known as Tangerine Bank) was founded with almost entirely online banking using only small cafes for meetings and very few physical branches. This was completely different from how banks had operated in Canada previously. By the early 2000s, all of the major banks in Canada rolled out some form of online banking.

==== Ukraine ====
Remote customer service of banks via the internet or Online banking (e-banking) in Ukraine was introduced more than two decades ago. Legal entities have been using the remote control of bank accounts since the mid-1990s. PrivatBank, which launched the “Privat24” system in 2000, became a pioneer in retail online banking.

Since 2000, most financial institutions have been actively implementing online offices and web banking.
2007 - the number of Ukrainian banks that introduced Online Banking exceeded 20.
2018 - the ability to manage accounts and make transfers online is available in almost all financial institutions in Ukraine.

Nowadays, the list of Internet banking services, with rare exceptions, repeats the entire product line of banks. With the help of Internet banking (IB), you can not only control the movement of funds in their accounts, but also perform more complex operations: for example, order a payment card or open a deposit account, repay the loan, and recently it became possible to buy and sell currency.

The rapid development of Internet banking in Ukraine is provoking the growth of Internet users. It is important to mention that the largest functionality, more than 40 options - from transfers and opening deposits to home accounting and purchasing tickets are available in PrivatBank. There are 37 options in the Internet banking system of the First Ukrainian International Bank, 35 - in Alfa-Bank. One of the most popular services in which Internet banking users are interested in the ability to pay remotely for utilities.

==== Ethiopia ====
Compared to several years ago, when the people living in Macedonia had to go directly to the banks to perform financial transactions, today there is a widely functional e-banking system. Macedonian banks today offer conventional e-banking services, electronic products including debit/credit cards and e-trading and contemporary electronic services like internet banking and online investing. What is important when it comes to e-banking is the trust in banks, usability of the platforms and the overall marketing for e-banking from banks. Moreover, it&#x27;s also important to constantly update the e-banking services. One successful example regarding the above-mentioned characteristics in Macedonia is “Stopanska Banka” AD Skopje. In the country, several factors significantly influence the level of adoption and usage of e-banking services, such as age, level of education and complexity of the e-banking services offered by banks. Naturally, elderly clients use e-banking services less than younger people. In addition, the level of education has a significant influence on the level of usage, meaning that the higher the education level, the more likely is for the citizen to use e-banking services. As for the satisfaction, citizens are generally more satisfied with the e-banking services offered by various banks when they have a diverse portfolio of services and offer fast and simple completion of transactions.

==== Cook Islands ====
The Bank of the Cook Islands introduced online banking in 2015, under the leadership of Vaine Nooana-Arioka.

==Operation==
To access a bank and online banking facility, a customer with internet access will need to register with the bank for the service, and set up a password and other credentials for customer verification. The customer visits the financial institution&#x27;s secure website, and enters the online banking facility using the customer number and credentials previously set up.

Each financial institution can determine the types of financial transactions which a customer may transact through online banking, but usually includes obtaining account balances, a list of recent transactions, electronic bill payments, financing loans and funds transfers between a customer&#x27;s or another&#x27;s accounts. Most banks set limits on the amounts that may be transacted, and other restrictions. Most banks also enable customers to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer&#x27;s premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer&#x27;s accounting software. The facility may also enable the customer to order a cheque book, statements, report loss of credit cards, stop payment on a cheque, advise change of address and other routine actions.

Some financial institutions offer special internet banking services, for example, Personal financial management support, such as importing data into personal accounting software. Some online banking platforms support account aggregation to allow the customers to monitor all of their accounts in one place whether they are with their main bank or with other institutions.

==Security==

Security of a customer&#x27;s financial information is very important, without which online banking could not operate. Similarly the reputational risks to banks themselves are important. Financial institutions have set up various security processes to reduce the risk of unauthorized online access to a customer&#x27;s records, but there is no consistency to the various approaches adopted.

The use of a secure website has been almost universally embraced.

Though single password authentication is still in use, it by itself is not considered secure enough for online banking in some countries. There are essentially two different security methods in use for online banking:
* The PIN/TAN system where the PIN represents a password, used for the login and TANs representing one-time passwords to authenticate transactions. TANs can be distributed in different ways, the most popular one is to send a list of TANs to the online banking user by postal letter. Another way of using TANs is to generate them by need using a security token. These token generated TANs depend on the time and a unique secret, stored in the security token (two-factor authentication or 2FA).

:More advanced TAN generators (chipTAN) also include the transaction data into the TAN generation process after displaying it on their own screen to allow the user to discover man-in-the-middle attacks carried out by Trojans trying to secretly manipulate the transaction data in the background of the PC.

:Another way to provide TANs to an online banking user is to send the TAN of the current bank transaction to the user&#x27;s (GSM) mobile phone via SMS. The SMS text usually quotes the transaction amount and details, the TAN is only valid for a short period of time. Especially in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands many banks have adopted this &quot;SMS TAN&quot; service. There is also &quot;PhotoTAN&quot; service, where the bank generates and sends a QR code image to a smartphone device of the online banking user. 
:Usually online banking with PIN/TAN is done via a web browser using SSL secured connections, so that there is no additional encryption needed.

* Signature based online banking where all transactions are signed and encrypted digitally. The Keys for the signature generation and encryption can be stored on smartcards or any memory medium, depending on the concrete implementation (see, e.g., the Spanish ID card &quot;DNI electrónico&quot;).

===Attacks===
Attacks on online banking used today are based on deceiving the user to steal login data and valid TANs. Two well known examples for those attacks are phishing and pharming. Cross-site scripting and keylogger/Trojan horses can also be used to steal login information.

A method to attack signature based online banking methods is to manipulate the used software in a way, that correct transactions are shown on the screen and faked transactions are signed in the background.

Another kind of attack is the so-called man-in-the-browser attack, a variation of the man-in-the-middle attack where a Trojan horse permits a remote attacker to secretly modify the destination account number and also the amount in the web browser.

A 2008 U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Technology Incident Report, compiled from suspicious activity reports banks file quarterly, lists 536 cases of computer intrusion, with an average loss per incident of $30,000. That adds up to a nearly $16-million loss in the second quarter of 2007. Computer intrusions increased by 150 percent between the first quarter of 2007 and the second. In 80 percent of the cases, the source of the intrusion is unknown but it occurred during online banking, the report states.

In 2014 in the UK, losses from online banking fraud rose by 48% compared with 2013. According to a study by a group of Cambridge University cybersecurity researchers in 2017, online banking fraud has doubled since 2011.

As of 2012 there were also combined attacks using malware and social engineering to persuade the user himself to transfer money to the fraudsters on the ground of false claims (like the claim the bank would require a &quot;test transfer&quot; or the claim a company had falsely transferred money to the user&#x27;s account and he should &quot;send it back&quot;).

===Countermeasures===
There exist several countermeasures which try to avoid attacks.

Whatever operating system is used, it is advised that the operating system is still supported, and properly patched.

Digital certificates are used against phishing and pharming, in signature based online banking variants (HBCI/FinTS) the use of &quot;Secoder&quot; card readers is a measurement to uncover software side manipulations of the transaction data.

In 2001, the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued guidance for multifactor authentication (MFA) and then required to be in place by the end of 2006.

In 2012, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security advised all banks to consider the PC systems of their users being infected by malware by default and therefore use security processes where the user can cross-check the transaction data against manipulations like for example (provided the security of the mobile phone holds up) SMS TAN where the transaction data is sent along with the TAN number or standalone smartcard readers with an own screen including the transaction data into the TAN generation process while displaying it beforehand to the user (see chipTAN) to counter man-in-the-middle attacks.

==Criticism and problems==
The increase in popularity of online banking with a concomitant closure of local bank branch offices or reduced retail opening hours discriminates against people who cannot use online banking, for example, elderly or disabled people who prefer to deal with banking issues face-to-face.

In 2022, a retired Spanish urologist with Parkinson&#x27;s disease gathered more than 600,000 signatures in an online petition asking banks and other institutions to serve all citizens, and not discriminate against the oldest and most vulnerable members. In Spain, the number of bank branches had shrunk to about 20,000 in 19 years since the bailout of 2012 and with the Coronavirus pandemic another 3000 branches closed in 2 years. &quot;They are excluding those of us who have trouble using the internet.&quot;
In February 2022, Spanish banks signed a protocol at the Ministry of Economy (Spain) pledging to offer better customer services to senior citizens, for example by &quot;extending again their branch opening hours, giving priority to older people to access counters and simplifying the interface of their apps and web pages&quot;.

With online banking, race discrimination is even less likely to be pinpointed, because of intransparent decision-making by algorithms.

Online banking requires access to broadband services. However not everyone has equal access to the internet, which has been called the digital divide. In March 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission formed a task force to prevent digital discrimination.

<doc id="713997" wikidata="Q8025741" url="?curid=713997" title="Winnipeg Declaration">
<text>The Winnipeg Declaration, sometimes referred to as the Winnipeg Manifesto, was the programme adopted by the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Canada to replace the Regina Manifesto. Its full name is the &quot;1956 Winnipeg Declaration of Principles of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation,&quot; and it was adopted at the party&#x27;s national convention held that year in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

==Evolution of party==
The declaration reflected the evolution of the party from socialism to a more moderate form of social democracy and Keynesian economics since its founding during the Great Depression. It also reflected the increased pragmatism that had coloured the party since it took power in the province of Saskatchewan. The anticommunist mood of the Cold War also caused the CCF to seek to moderate its stance. The CCF federal vice-president and future New Democratic Party leader, David Lewis, was instrumental in drafting the document and having it approved.

==From nationalization to mixed economy==
The Regina Manifesto called for a socialist economy in which major sectors of the economy would be nationalized and placed under public control, but the Winnipeg Declaration called for a mixed economy in which &quot;there will be an important role for public, private and co-operative enterprise working together in the people&#x27;s interest&quot; and also moderated earlier demands for a planned economy. The Regina Manifesto declared that the CCF would not rest until capitalism was &quot;eradicated,&quot; but the Winnipeg Declaration affirmed, &quot;The CCF will not rest content until every person in this land and in all other lands is able to enjoy equality and freedom, a sense of human dignity, and an opportunity to live a rich and meaningful life as a citizen of a free and peaceful world.&quot;

==Statement of principles==
The Winnipeg Declaration remained the basic statement of party principles of the CCF and its successor, the New Democratic Party, until 1983 when it was replaced by the Statement of Principles.

<doc id="713998" wikidata="Q771666" url="?curid=713998" title="Light rail in Sydney">
<text>The Sydney light rail network (or Sydney Light Rail for the inner-city lines) is a light rail/tram system serving the city of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The network consists of four passenger routes, the L1 Dulwich Hill, L2 Randwick, L3 Kingsford and L4 Westmead &amp; Carlingford lines. It comprises 58 stops and a system length of approximately , making it the second largest light rail network in Australia behind the tram network in Melbourne, Victoria. 

The network is managed by Transport for NSW, with day-to-day operations contracted to Transdev. In the 2023–24 financial year, 40.59 million passenger journeys were made on the network, equating to over 110,000 journeys per day.

==History==
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Sydney developed an extensive tram network, which grew to be the second largest in the Southern Hemisphere and second largest in the Commonwealth after London. The increasing rate of private car ownership, the perception that trams contributed to traffic congestion and the general rundown conditions of the network due to the lack of funding after World War II led to the progressive replacement of tram services with buses, with the final section of the tram network closing on 25 February 1961.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the inner city areas of Darling Harbour and Pyrmont were the subject of an urban renewal program. In 1988 the Sydney Monorail opened, connecting Darling Harbour to the city centre. With poor integration between the monorail and other transport modes and the increasing redevelopment of the Pyrmont peninsula – including the establishment of Sydney&#x27;s first legal casino – it was decided to convert a disused section of the Metropolitan Goods railway line into a light rail line. A section of track between Pyrmont and Haymarket was upgraded and a new on-street section was built to link the line to Central station. The line was set up as a public-private partnership. It opened in August 1997, running between Central Station and Wentworth Park, Pyrmont.

The private owner soon made proposals for a western extension continuing along the disused goods line, plus a new line through the city centre from Central to Circular Quay. The western extension opened in 2000, terminating at Lilyfield, but the company was unsuccessful in its attempts to develop a CBD line, which saw the development of light rail stagnate for the remainder of the decade.

By contrast, the 2010s saw major expansion and reform of light rail in Sydney including the announcement and delivery of multiple new infrastructure projects, integration of ticketing with the city&#x27;s other transport modes, the introduction of new trams and the transfer of the network to full public ownership. This coincided with broader investment in urban railways across Sydney and Australia, with the state transport minister in 2020 labelling Sydney a &quot;train city&quot; in reference to the various rail modes in the city.

===Ownership and operation===
====Public-private partnership====

In March 1994, the Sydney Light Rail Company (SLRC) was formed. SLRC was awarded a 30-year concession to operate the light rail system until February 2028 when ownership would pass to the New South Wales Government. The contract gave the company significant control over the commercial arrangements relating to future extensions or interconnecting lines. Operation of the line was contracted to TNT Transit Systems, which also owned the Sydney Monorail.

The SLRC purchased TNT Transit Systems in August 1998 as part of a joint venture with CGEA Transport. This resulted in CGEA Transport taking over the light rail operating contract. CGEA Transport and its successors have operated the inner city light rail network ever since.

In early 2001, Connex (renamed from CGEA Transport in 1999) sold its share of the monorail to the SLRC, bringing the monorail and light rail under unified ownership and leading to the formation of Metro Transport Sydney.

The New South Wales Government purchased Metro Transport Sydney in March 2012, and the company was placed under the control of Transport for NSW. The purchase removed the contractual restrictions on expanding the light rail system and allowed the government to dismantle the monorail, assisting its plans to redevelop the Sydney Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre.

====Government ownership====

From 1 July 2013, the Metro Light Rail brand was phased out as part of a broader rebranding and reorganisation of public transport services in New South Wales. The process of shutting down Metro Transport Sydney and transferring assets to Transport for NSW was completed in September 2014.

Following the announcement of the CBD and South East Light Rail, the government decided to group the contract covering the construction of the new line with the operation and maintenance of both lines of the inner city network. In December 2014, Transport for NSW awarded the contract to the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium. This saw Transdev Sydney, the operator under the previous contract, continue to operate and maintain the network as part of the consortium. The operating contract commenced on 1 July 2015 and runs until 2034.

After taking control of the Inner West Light Rail and announcing the CBD and South East Light Rail, the government also moved to establish a separate network centred around the Western Sydney suburb of Parramatta. Transdev was contracted to operate the Parramatta network as part of the Great River City Light Rail consortium. This contract runs for eight years from construction completion, with a possible extension of up to an additional ten years.

==Operations==
===Lines===
Sydney&#x27;s light rail network consists of:
* Inner West Light Rail – serviced by L1 Dulwich Hill Line
* CBD and South East Light Rail – serviced by L2 Randwick Line and L3 Kingsford Line
* Parramatta Light Rail - serviced by L4 Westmead and Carlingford Line

&lt;/mapframe&gt;
The L1 Dulwich Hill Line is the network&#x27;s original passenger route, which first commenced in August 1997. It operates along the Inner West Light Rail between Central Station and Dulwich Hill, stopping at 23 stops along the route. It connects Sydney&#x27;s Inner West with the Pyrmont peninsula, Darling Harbour and the southern end of the city centre. 

The majority of the Inner West Light Rail line is along the alignment of a former freight railway line, with a short on-street section at the city end. The line opened between Central railway station in the city and Wentworth Park, Pyrmont on 11 August 1997, then extended west to Lilyfield in August 2000, and then southwest to Dulwich Hill in March 2014.

From late October 2021 to February 2022, services were replaced by buses after major cracks were found in all 12 Urbos 3 trams serving the line. Limited service was then restored with borrowed Citadis trams from the CBD and South East Light Rail.

====L2 Randwick &amp; L3 Kingsford Lines====

&lt;mapframe width=&quot;220&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; longitude=&quot;151.2253&quot; latitude=&quot;-33.8917&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; text=&quot;L2 Randwick Line and L3 Kingsford Line&quot;&gt;

&lt;/mapframe&gt;
The L2 Randwick Line and L3 Kingsford Line are Sydney&#x27;s newest passenger routes on the Sydney light rail network. L2 Randwick Line services commenced on 14 December 2019, while L3 Kingsford Line services commenced operations on 3 April 2020. They operate on the CBD and South East Light Rail, between Circular Quay at the northern end of the city centre to Central Station at the southern end, then continuing to the south-eastern suburbs.

CBD and South East Light Rail were built to reduce bus congestion in the CBD and provide higher capacity public transport to the Sydney Football Stadium, Sydney Cricket Ground, Randwick Racecourse and the University of New South Wales, which were previously served only by buses. In contrast to the Inner West Light Rail, the line is mostly on-street and follows a similar path to routes used by the former tramway network. Major construction began in October 2015.

Parramatta Light Rail is the name given to two lines that converge on the Western Sydney centre of Parramatta. These lines will have no connection to the Inner West or CBD and South East lines.

The first line runs from Carlingford to Westmead via the Parramatta CBD. It includes the conversion of most of the former heavy rail Carlingford line to light rail standards. Construction began in 2018 and was opened to the public on 20 December 2024. 

The preferred route for the second line was announced in October 2017. This line branches from the first line at Rydalmere and travels through Ermington, Melrose Park, Wentworth Point and on to the Sydney Olympic Park events precinct.

==== Under construction ====
In February 2024, Stage 2 of the Parramatta Light Rail linking Parramatta to Sydney Olympic Park via Rydalmere, Melrose Park and Wentworth Point received planning approval after the New South Wales Government invested $200 million to expedite planning processes for the project in its 202324 state budget.

==Rolling stock==

All services on the Inner West Light Rail were previously operated by a single class of tram. A second class was introduced to operate services on the CBD and South East Light Rail. All vehicles to have operated on the system have been articulated, low floor and bi-directional. The system uses standard gauge track and 750 volt direct current electrification.

Both lines use different specifications on a range of measures including gaps between platforms and carriages, height and width of the actual track, clearances between the track corridor and its surrounds, and distance between the back wheels of the trams. As a result, Urbos 3 trams used on the Inner West Light Rail (L1 Dulwich Hill) line are unable to serve on the CBD and South East Light Rail (L2 Randwick and L3 Kingsford) lines However, Citadis 305 trams used on the CBD and South East Light Rail are able to run on the Inner West Light Rail as the vehicles are narrower. This was to allow the fleet to access the Lilyfield maintenance centre via the Inner West Light Rail. This also allowed for Citadis trams to be used for L1 Dulwich Hill services on the Inner West Light Rail.

===Urbos 3 &amp; Urbos 100===

==== Inner West Light Rail ====
Following the extension of the Inner West Light Rail to Dulwich Hill, more rolling stock was needed to support services and run alongside the Variotrams that had been providing services on the line since the first section opened in 1997. A tender for six Urbos 3s was awarded to Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) in August 2012. The first unit arrived in Sydney on 19 December 2013 and entered service on 24 July 2014. All were in service by August, allowing the leased Urbos 2s to be returned to Spain.

On 11 October 2013, the Government announced an order for six additional Urbos 3s to replace the Variotrams. All Urbos 3s from the additional order had entered service by the end of June 2015.

The Urbos 3s are approximately long and feature two double and two single doors on each side. The seats on the first batch are generally in the transverse configuration – at 90 degrees to the sides of the vehicle. The second batch replace some of the transverse seats with longitudinal seating, providing more standing room. Digital voice announcements and internal dot-matrix displays provide information about the next stop. They have a standard capacity of 206 passengers and a crush capacity of 272. The vehicles are numbered 2112, 2114–2124. 2113 was skipped due to superstition, particularly among the Chinese who travel to the Star casino by light rail, about numbers ending in 13.

In June 2021, a contract with CAF for four Urbos 100 (a variant on the Urbos 3) five-module unit was secured.

On 28 October 2021, service was suspended on the Inner West Light Rail after cracking in welds was discovered in some of the Urbos 3 vehicles during routine inspections.

==== Parramatta Light Rail ====
Thirteen Urbos 100 carriages were procured for the first stage of the Parramatta Light Rail. Each tram is long and consist of seven modules. These vehicles will support wire-free operation using batteries, which will be utilised on the on-street sections of the line around Parramatta and Westmead.

===Citadis 305===
As part of the winning consortium to build and operate the CBD and South East Light Rail, Alstom supplied sixty Citadis 305 trams. Each vehicle consists of five sections, and they are coupled together to operate in pairs. Original plans for the line intended for the trams to be approximately long and operate as single units. Wire-free operation in a section of George Street between Bathurst Street and Circular Quay was to be achieved via battery storage. In December 2014, it was announced that Alstom&#x27;s proprietary APS technology would be used in place of batteries. The length of the trams would also be reduced, but they would now operate in pairs, giving each pair a total length of approximately .

The first unit was completed in May 2017. The first six were manufactured in La Rochelle, France, the remaining 54 in Barcelona, Spain. They are numbered 001–060.

After the entire Urbos 3 fleet of the Inner West Light Rail was withdrawn for repairs in November 2021, Citadis trams were borrowed from the CBD and South East Light Rail and tested on the Inner West Light Rail from December 2021. The Citadis vehicles began services on the Inner West Light Rail on 12 February 2022 on a temporary basis until the Urbos 3 fleet could be repaired and brought back into service. They continue to operate following the reintroduction of the Urbos 3s.

==== Variotram ====

The network&#x27;s original rolling stock was the Variotram which was introduced with the opening of the first section of the Inner West Light Rail in 1997. Seven German-designed vehicles were manufactured by Adtranz in Dandenong. The Variotram design is modular and was extended for the Sydney system. The capacity of the vehicles was 217 passengers, of which 74 were seated. The first was damaged in an accident near while on its delivery run and had to be returned to Melbourne for repairs. On tests up to three trams were coupled together allowing a maximum capacity of 600 passengers if required. They were numbered 2101–2107, continuing the Sydney trams sequence that finished at number 2087 with the last Sydney R1-Class Tram.

The vehicles had a floor-to-rail height of and the bogies had no axles between the wheels and were powered by hub motors. The design weight was reduced to compensate for the addition of climate-control air-conditioning equipment. Each was fitted with three double doors on each side which had enhanced safety systems with obstacle detection interlocked with the traction system. Seats were generally in the transverse configuration – at 90 degrees to the sides of the vehicle. In 2014, the original external destination rolls were replaced with dot-matrix displays and digital voice announcements were installed. There were no internal displays. The last Variotram was withdrawn from service after operating overnight between Central and The Star on 27/28 May 2015.

After sustaining damage in a derailment at Glebe on 7 October 2013, Variotram number 2106 was scrapped. The remaining six Variotrams were placed into storage in Penrith during the first half of 2015. Having been retained by Transport Heritage NSW, in October 2018, 2107 was placed in the custody of the Sydney Tramway Museum, Loftus. The remaining five (2101–2105) were scrapped in early 2018.

==== Urbos 2 ====

Four leased CAF Urbos 2 trams were introduced on the Inner West Light Rail in 2014. They entered service to coincide with the extension of the line to Dulwich Hill, supplementing the Variotrams and ensuring service frequencies on the line could be maintained. The four trams had previously operated in Spain. Three units (2108–2110) were from Vélez-Málaga, where they operated between 2006 and 2012. The other tram (2111) was from Seville. The first Urbos 2 arrived in Sydney on 4 September 2013. Delivery was completed in November. The trams entered service on 22 March 2014, five days before the opening of the extension to Dulwich Hill. Following the introduction of the Urbos 3 trams in July 2014, the Urbos 2s were withdrawn and returned to Spain. The Urbos 2s were unpopular with passengers and attracted complaints.

The trams featured four double and two single doors on each side. The seats were unpadded and were generally built in the longitudinal seating configuration – running parallel to the sides of the vehicle&#x27;s body. Digital voice announcements and internal dot-matrix displays provided information about the next stop.

== Patronage ==
The following table lists patronage figures for the network during the corresponding financial year. Australia&#x27;s financial years start on 1 July and end on 30 June. Major events that affected the number of journeys made or how patronage is measured are included as notes.


===Ticketing and fares===
The smartcard-based Opal card ticketing system, which was introduced to the network on 1 December 2014, is valid on metro, train, bus, ferry and light rail services. Different fares apply for these modes, except that the same fares apply to light rail and buses. However, they are treated as separate modes for fare calculation purposes. Light rail stops feature Opal top up machines that also sell Opal single trip tickets. The single trip tickets are more expensive than the standard Opal fare. They are only valid for travel on light rail and must be used on the day of purchase. The following table lists Opal fares for reusable smartcards and single trip tickets.
^ = $2.50 for Senior/Pensioner cardholders

Fares are calculated using a straight line distance between the origin and destination stops. No two stops on the existing line are located more than from each other using this method, so the &gt; band doesn&#x27;t apply to light rail services.

When it first opened, the Inner West Light Rail used its paper-based ticketing system. Paper tickets were originally sold from ticket machines on stop platforms but were later issued by conductors on board. During the 2010s, this system gradually merged with the broader Sydney ticketing system, culminating in the introduction of Opal and the withdrawal of all other tickets. This process was completed on 1 August 2016.

==Potential extensions==
Several transport corridors have significant potential to allow for the growth of the network beyond its current route structure.

===Anzac Parade===

The New South Wales Government&#x27;s 2012 policy document entitled &quot;Sydney&#x27;s Light Rail Future&quot; proposed investigating an extension of the CBD and South East Light Rail along the southern Anzac Parade corridor.

By 2014, an initial investigation had commenced. Three potential options were examined; a extension to Maroubra Junction, a extension to Malabar and an extension to La Perouse.

The government&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Greater Sydney Services and Infrastructure Plan&quot; included a proposal for an extension to Maroubra Junction. The extension would however not be developed for at least 10 years.

===The Bays Precinct===
The Bays Precinct is a large waterfront area to the west of the Sydney CBD being proposed for urban renewal by the New South Wales Government. The southern part of the precinct is served by the existing Inner West Light Rail. A planning document released by the government in October 2015 suggested light rail could be extended to the northern part of the precinct, possibly using the Glebe Island Bridge.

The government&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Greater Sydney Services and Infrastructure Plan&quot; included a proposal for a new line from Leichhardt North to Pyrmont via The Bays Precinct and the Glebe Island Bridge. It would connect with the existing Inner West Light Rail at both ends. The line would not be developed for at least 10 years.

===Parramatta Light Rail extensions===
The New South Wales Government&#x27;s 2012 policy document entitled &quot;Sydney&#x27;s Light Rail Future&quot; proposed investigating a Western Sydney light rail network. This led to several corridors being investigated in the early planning stages of the Parramatta Light Rail project. The final corridors selected for development were announced in 2015.

In early 2017, Transport for NSW had begun an investigation into an extension of the Parramatta Light Rail from Carlingford to Epping.

The government&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Greater Sydney Services and Infrastructure Plan&quot; proposed investigating unspecified extensions to the network. The extensions would not be developed for at least 10 years.

In 2024, the NSW Legislative Council Inquiry into Current and future public transport needs in Western Sydney recommended &quot;that the Government urgently investigate extending Stage 2 of the Parramatta Light Rail project so that the line no longer terminates at the Carter Street precinct but continues from there to terminate at Lidcombe railway station&quot;. This recommendation has been endorsed by Cumberland Council and public transport advocacy groups such as EcoTransit Sydney.

In September 2024, the Minns Labor Government committed $2.1 billion to stage two of Parramatta Light Rail to be routed through Melrose Park and Wentworth Point with stops in Sydney Olympic Park, Rydalmere, Ermington and Camellia.

===Green Square and Parramatta Road===
In 2012, the City of Sydney Council recommended that a Light Rail link be built from the city to Green Square, to service the commercial and residential developments being built in the area, which is expected to become Australia&#x27;s most densely populated precinct. The council has spent more than $30 million buying land for a light rail corridor. In July 2015, New South Wales Transport Minister Andrew Constance stated that the area was likely to be served by a light rail link in the future. This led to a decision in October by the City of Sydney to allocate $445,000 to develop plans for a light rail line from the city to Green Square. The council estimated a link would cost $350–500 million to build. In 2023, the City of Sydney restated this intention in its draft &#x27;Access Strategy&#x27;, along with plans to extend the system further down George Street and Broadway, towards the University of Sydney. No formal announcements or works have begun. 

In June 2024, ALTRAC proposed a plan for a new light rail corridor between Green Square and Leichhardt via Central.

=== Bondi ===
In 2011, Waverley Council advocated for the extension of the light rail network to link the current infrastructure to Bondi Junction and Bondi Beach. The council commissioned AECOM to undertake a feasibility assessment of the reintroduction of light rail on the corridor between Bondi Beach and Bondi Junction (Stage 1) and onto the CBD (Stage 2) to achieve mass transit of passengers and requested Transport for NSW consider the CBD to Bondi Beach corridor as a priority route in the Sydney Light Rail Plan.

<text>Claude Percy Lemieux (born July 16, 1965), is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played 21 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for six teams between 1983 and 2009. Lemieux won four Stanley Cup championships during his career, two with the New Jersey Devils, with whom he won the Conn Smythe Trophy during the team&#x27;s victory in the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals. He is one of only 11 players to win a Stanley Cup championship with at least three teams. He is also known as one of the greatest playoff performers, as his 80 career playoff goals are the ninth most in NHL history.

Lemieux was born in Buckingham, Quebec, but grew up in Mont-Laurier, Quebec. He was drafted in the second round of the 1983 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens and played with them from 1983–1990, winning his first Stanley Cup with the team in 1986. In 1990, he was traded to the Devils, with whom he played five seasons and won a Stanley Cup. He was traded to the Colorado Avalanche in 1995 and won his second consecutive Stanley Cup during the 1996 finals. During the playoffs that season, Lemieux hit Kris Draper of the Detroit Red Wings from behind, breaking Draper&#x27;s orbital, cheek, and jaw bones, and sparking a vicious rivalry between the Avalanche and Red Wings. In 1999, Lemieux was traded back to the Devils and won a second Stanley Cup with them in the 2000 finals – his fourth overall. Over the next few seasons, he played for the Phoenix Coyotes and Dallas Stars. Lemieux left the NHL in 2003 and briefly joined EV Zug of the Swiss Nationalliga A before retiring as a player. In 2005, he was named president of the ECHL&#x27;s Phoenix RoadRunners, a position he held for two years. Lemieux returned to the NHL with the San Jose Sharks for the 2008–2009 season, but retired again after that year.

His son Brendan Lemieux is also a former NHL player, and currently plays for HC Davos of the National League in Switzerland.

==Playing career==
===NHL===
Lemieux was drafted in the second round of the 1983 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens. He played with the Canadiens from 1983–1990, winning the Stanley Cup with the team in 1986.

In September 1990, Lemieux was traded to the New Jersey Devils for Sylvain Turgeon. Lemieux won his second Stanley Cup in 1995 as New Jersey defeated the Detroit Red Wings. Completing the postseason with 13 goals, he also won the Conn Smythe Trophy that year as the playoff MVP.

Shortly before the beginning of the 1995–96 season, Lemieux was traded to the Colorado Avalanche in a three-team deal that also involved Wendel Clark and Steve Thomas. When the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in 1996, Lemieux became the tenth player to win back-to-back Stanley Cups with different teams.

In November 1999, Lemieux was traded back to New Jersey in a deal that sent Brian Rolston to Colorado. He won his fourth and final Stanley Cup title with the Devils in 2000. In that offseason, Lemieux signed as a free agent with the Phoenix Coyotes.

In January 2003, the Coyotes traded him to the Dallas Stars for Scott Pellerin and a conditional draft pick. Lemieux ended his NHL playing career with Dallas after the 2002–03 season. He played briefly the following season for EV Zug of the Swiss Nationalliga A.

===Retirement===
In 2005, Lemieux became president of the ECHL incarnation of the Phoenix RoadRunners until resigning in 2007.

In 2007, Lemieux took part in the second season of the Spike TV television show &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;. In October 2009, Lemieux began competing as a pairs figure skater on the CBC Television reality show &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot; with Shae-Lynn Bourne. For one of their routines, the pair skated to Lemieux&#x27;s recorded version of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, which he sang as a duet with Kathryn Rose.

===2008 comeback===
In September 2008, on RDS, Lemieux expressed an interest in making a comeback to the NHL. He began the season with the China Sharks of the Asia League Ice Hockey before signing a contract with the Worcester Sharks on November 25. After scoring two goals and six points in 14 games with Worcester, Lemieux signed a two-way contract with the San Jose Sharks on December 29, 2008. The following day, he cleared waivers and continued to play for Worcester. On January 19, 2009, the San Jose Sharks recalled Lemieux to the NHL; on February 19, he recorded the first (and only) NHL point of his comeback, assisting on Milan Michalek&#x27;s second-period goal against the Los Angeles Kings. That same year, the Sharks won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy.

==International play==




Lemieux represented Canada three times in international competitions throughout his career. He made his first international appearance as a member of the Canadian national junior team at the 1985 World Junior Championships in Helsinki, Finland. Lemieux finished the tournament with 3 goals and 2 assists in 6 games to help Canada win its second World Junior gold medal. Lemieux was also a member of the 1987 Canada Cup winning team where he tallied 2 points in 6 games. His final appearance in international play came when he was selected to the Team Canada roster for the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. Lemieux picked up 19 penalty minutes in the eight games as Canada finished second.

==Reception==
===Playing style===
Throughout his career, Lemieux was noted for playing his best games during the postseason. Once Lemieux was called up to the NHL for good during the 1985–86 season, he played in 15 consecutive postseasons. In his career, starting with the 1986 playoffs, he played in the postseason 18 different years, missing only the 2001 playoffs while with the Phoenix Coyotes. Lemieux played in 234 playoff games, which is fourth all-time in the NHL. On three occasions, he scored more goals during the playoffs than during the regular season (1985–86 with Montreal, 1994–95 with New Jersey, and 1996–97 with Colorado). Lemieux retired with 80 career playoff goals, ninth all-time in the NHL.

===Criticism===
Lemieux was also notorious for being among the league&#x27;s most hated and dirtiest players; in fact, a 2009 TSN special entitled &quot;The Top 10 Most Hated NHL Players of All Time&quot; ranked him second, behind only Sean Avery. While playing for Montreal, during a playoff game against the Calgary Flames, Lemieux bit Calgary&#x27;s Jim Peplinski on the finger during a scuffle, prompting the Calgary winger to say, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know they allowed cannibalism in the NHL.&quot;

====Hit on Kris Draper====
Lemieux&#x27;s reputation for playing dirty was solidified in a 1996 incident with the Avalanche when Lemieux checked Kris Draper of the Detroit Red Wings into the boards from behind during Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals. Draper suffered a concussion, broken jaw, broken nose, and broken cheekbone, all of which led to Draper having reconstructive surgery on his face and his jaw wired shut for several weeks. This incident sparked a bitter rivalry between the two teams. Unhappy with his actions, the NHL suspended him for two games, which caused an outcry from some fans who felt he deserved a harsher penalty. Red Wings player Dino Ciccarelli said after the series, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I shook this guy&#x27;s friggin&#x27; hand after the game. That pisses me right off.&quot;

Tensions between the two teams would continue to rise, reaching a breaking point the next season. During a fight, the infamous Red Wings–Avalanche brawl, Wings forward Darren McCarty engaged Lemieux shortly after a fight started by Peter Forsberg with Igor Larionov had stopped play. McCarty threw one punch to Lemieux, who “turtled” on the ice and was badly beaten before the officials could remove McCarty from him. McCarty was assessed a double minor for roughing. Several fights erupted around the two as both teams, including the goalies, fought. In the next regular season game between the teams, Lemieux switched sides on the opening face-off to line up across from McCarty, resulting in another fight at puck drop.

==Personal life==
Lemieux was born in Buckingham, Quebec, and resides in Huntington Beach, California. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on 26 June 2009.

Lemieux is the older brother of former NHL forward Jocelyn Lemieux. Lemieux has another brother, Serge, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. He is not related to NHL Hall of Fame player Mario Lemieux.

Lemieux has four children between two marriages: three sons and a daughter. his son Brendan is a forward for the Carolina Hurricanes. They are the only father-son duo to be punished by the NHL for biting other players.

Since he retired from the NHL, Lemieux has often been a guest on TSN&#x27;s &quot;Off the Record with Michael Landsberg&quot;, sharing insights on his playing days in the NHL.

<doc id="714003" wikidata="Q3710562" url="?curid=714003" title="Champoeg, Oregon">
<text>Champoeg ( , historically ) is a former town in the U.S. state of Oregon. Now a ghost town, it was an important settlement in the Willamette Valley in the early 1840s. Located halfway between Oregon City and Salem, it was the site of the first provisional government of the Oregon Country.

The town site is on the south bank of the Willamette River in northern Marion County, on French Prairie, approximately 5 mi (8 km) southeast of Newberg. The town is now part of Champoeg State Heritage Area, an Oregon state park. The Champoeg State Park Historic Archeological District is within the heritage area.

The name &quot;Champoeg&quot; comes from the Kalapuyan word &quot;[čʰámpuik]&quot;, which might be an abbreviation of &quot;[čʰa-čʰíma-púičuk]&quot;, referring to the edible root &quot;[púičuk]&quot;, or yampa.

==History==
Champoeg is best known as the site of a series of meetings held in the town during the 1840s. On February 7, 1841, Willamette Valley settlers convened there for the first time. They selected Oregon missionary Jason Lee as their chairman and considered measures to deal with problem of wolves menacing their settlements. It was to be the first in a series of &quot;Wolf Meetings&quot; at the town site that would establish the basis of civil codes.

By the middle 1840s, the question of the possession of the disputed Oregon Country between the United States and the United Kingdom began to loom large. On May 2, 1843, a meeting was held at the town to determine whether a provisional government should be established. The measure passed by 52 to 50. A group of nine representatives was named to create a provisional government with Champoeg as its capital. A petition to the United States Congress was drafted and sent to Washington, D.C., with William Gilpin, who had helped draft the petition and came to the Willamette Valley with the expedition of John C. Frémont. On his journey eastward to deliver the petition, Gilpin evangelized for the settlement of the Pacific Northwest, helping to spread &quot;Oregon fever&quot;. He presented the petition to Congress in 1845. The question of possession of the Oregon Country was settled the following year in the 1846 Oregon Treaty. When the Oregon Territory was organized in 1848, however, Champoeg was not chosen as the capital.

Around 1852 the town had grown to include a ferry across the Willamette, a warehouse owned by Francis Pettygrove and Alanson Beers, a steamboat landing, a granary owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and a stagecoach office. There were 10 north-south streets and six east-west streets laid out in the community. Champoeg was also the crossroads of the Champoeg-St. Paul Road, Champoeg-Salem Road, Champoeg-Oregon City Road, and the Champoeg-DeGuire&#x27;s Ferry Road. Most of the town was located on the Donation Land Claims of Robert Newell and André Longtain.

The town continued to exist after Oregon statehood. However, on December 2, 1861, the adjacent Willamette River rose 55 feet (17 m) above its normal summer stage, flooding the town with seven feet (2 m) of water. The great flood destroyed most of the structures in the town, barring two saloons. Panicked residents found shelter at the Newell House, which was built upon a hill. Robert Newell went nearly bankrupt in caring for the flood victims. Champoeg was never rebuilt after the disaster. The town site is now preserved as Champoeg State Heritage Area. A 1901 monument records the names of the 52 settlers who voted to establish the provisional government at the 1843 meeting. Dams installed since the 1930s make another catastrophic flood unlikely.

==Champoeg State Heritage Area==

Amenities of the heritage area include a visitor center, an 1860s-style garden, the Newell House Museum – Robert Newell&#x27;s restored 1852 house – and the Pioneer Mothers Memorial Cabin Museum.

Also located in the park is the Historic Butteville Store, which was founded in 1863. Considered the oldest operating store in Oregon, it is the last remaining commercial building of the nearby community of Butteville. A series of weekend interpretive programs is available late June through Labor Day weekend, and the Champoeg Promise program provides an interactive living history program for schoolchildren.

The site is open year-round and is available for camping (tent, yurt, cabin and RV), hiking, disc golf, bicycling, bird watching, picnicking, fishing and boating.

===Archeological sites===
The Champoeg State Heritage Area is the site of the Champoeg State Park Historic Archeological District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. One of the important archeological finds at the site is the only mostly intact early homesite found so far on French Prairie. The evidence suggests that this was Robert Newell&#x27;s first homesite.

<doc id="714012" wikidata="Q7013328" url="?curid=714012" title="2005 New York City mayoral election">
<text>The 2005 New York City mayoral election occurred on Tuesday, November 8, 2005, with incumbent Republican mayor Michael Bloomberg soundly defeating former Bronx borough president Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic nominee. Several third-party candidates also ran for mayor. In July, mayoral candidates filed nominating petitions with the City Board of Elections.

Bloomberg won four of the five boroughs, the exception being the Bronx. He flipped the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. , the 2005 election was the last time a Republican was elected mayor of New York City, and the last time a Republican line carried Brooklyn. Bloomberg left the Republican Party in 2007 to register as an independent, though he was nominated for re-election by the Republican Party in 2009.

==Republican primary==

===Candidates===
* Michael Bloomberg, incumbent Mayor since 2002
* Walter Iwachiw
* Tom Ognibene, former City Councilman from Queens (1992–2002) and Council minority leader
* Steve Shaw

===Campaign===
Tom Ognibene ran on a platform supporting tax cuts, education reform and opposed Mayor Bloomberg&#x27;s smoking ban. He was expected to win the endorsement of the Conservative Party. He received 8,100 signatures, 600 more than the necessary 7,500 signatures to appear on the primary ballot. However, the Bloomberg campaign challenged many signatures, leaving Ognibene with 5,848 eligible signatures and forcing him off the ballot. On August 25, a federal judge refused to allow Ognibene on Republican ballot.

The first television ads were launched in English and Spanish by the Bloomberg campaign on May 18.

===Endorsements===
Ognibene was endorsed by the leaders of the Queens County Republican Committee on February 10.

===Aftermath===
Ognibene challenged the Republican nomination in a hearing on Thursday, August 25, but his challenge was unsuccessful.

==Democratic primary==

===Candidates===
* Christopher X. Brodeur, artist and Green Party candidate in 2001
* Fernando Ferrer, former Bronx Borough President (1987–2001) and candidate for Mayor in 2001
* C. Virginia Fields, Manhattan Borough President
* Gifford Miller, Speaker of the New York City Council
* Arthur Piccolo
* Anthony Weiner, U.S. Representative from Brooklyn and Queens

====Declined====
*Mark Green, nominee for mayor in 2001 (running for New York Attorney General in 2006)
*Bob Kerrey, former U.S. Senator from Nebraska and President of the New School (declined April 20)

===Campaign===
On August 3, Fernando Ferrer began running campaign advertisements. On August 12, the Gifford Miller campaign launched their own television ads. The Democratic candidates held their first debate on August 16. The Anthony Weiner campaign launched television ads on August 19, the same day voter registration for the primary elections ended. The Democratic candidates held their second televised debate on August 21; the live debate was sponsored by WCBS and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===Endorsements===
On September 1, Fernando Ferrer was endorsed by City Comptroller Bill Thompson and ACORN. On September 3, &quot;The New York Times&quot; endorsed Ferrer in the Democratic primary. The Democratic candidates held two final debates with the first on WNBC on September 7 and on WABC on September 8. On September 10, Reverend Al Sharpton endorsed Ferrer.

Prior to the primary, Ferrer was endorsed by New York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer, Carl McCall, Geraldine Ferraro, Sheldon Silver, the Transport Workers Union, Bronx borough president Adolfo Carrión Jr. and Ruth Messinger. Ferrer was also endorsed by Representatives Joseph Crowley, Gregory Meeks, Major Owens, José E. Serrano, Edolphus Towns and Nydia Velázquez.

===Results===
The Democratic primary was held on Tuesday, September 13, with initial returns showing Fernando Ferrer receiving 39.95% of the votes, just short of the 40% needed to avoid a run-off with second-place Anthony Weiner. Despite at first seeming poised to continue, the next morning Weiner conceded the election to Ferrer. However, the city election board insisted on proceeding with a $12 million election scheduled for Tuesday, September 27, with an additional debate even planned. This prompted a lawsuit supported by both candidates to prevent the election, the circumstance of which was avoided by a final count giving Ferrer just slightly over 40% of the vote.

==Other nominations==

===Conservative===
Despite his removal from the Republican primary, Tom Ognibene ran as the Conservative Party nominee.

===Independence===
On May 28, the Independence Party endorsed Michael Bloomberg for re-election.

===Liberal===
The Liberal Party of New York endorsed Bloomberg.

===Green===
Manhattan College history professor Anthony Gronowicz was the Green Party&#x27;s mayoral nominee. Gronowicz sought to strengthen affordable housing, supported renewable sources of energy and sought to provide free tuition to City University of New York. He was featured in an article in The Villager.

===Libertarian===
Audrey Silk, a former NYPD officer, community activist and founder of &quot;NYC Citizens Lobbying Against Smoker Harassment,&quot; was nominated by the party on April 16, 2005.

==General election==

* Michael Bloomberg, incumbent mayor since 2002 (Republican, Independence, Liberal)
* Fernando Ferrer, former Bronx Borough President (Democrat)
* Tom Ognibene (Conservative)
* Anthony Gronowicz (Green)
* Jimmy McMillan (Rent Is Too Damn High)
* Audrey Silk (Libertarian)
* Martin Koppel (Socialist Workers)

===Campaign===
Issues in the 2005 mayoral race included education, taxes, crime, transportation, public housing, homeland security funding, and the city budget. One prominent issue throughout 2005 was New York&#x27;s bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, as New York City was one of the finalists to serve as host city. On June 6, the planned West Side Stadium was defeated by the Public Authorities Control Board when Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno refused to vote for it. As a result, the new Mets ballpark, later Citi Field, had been supported by Mayor Bloomberg as the centerpiece of the revised bid. On July 6, the IOC awarded London with the 2012 Summer Olympics.

On October 23, Ferrer proposed Home Owner Property Exemption, or HOPE, a tax break for homeowners with a home property value of less than $100,000.

On October 6, a mayoral debate was held at the Apollo Theater from 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. with Fernando Ferrer and Tom Ognibene; Mayor Michael Bloomberg was absent. The last day for voter registration for the general election was October 14, 2005. The first mayoral debate between Fernando Ferrer and Mike Bloomberg was held on October 30, and broadcast on WABC. Ferrer and Bloomberg debated each other again on November 1, at a debate sponsored by WNBC and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.

The general election was held on Tuesday, November 8. Members of the New York City Council, as well as the offices of borough president, city comptroller, public advocate, and district attorney, were also up for election. At 10:30 p.m. on November 8, Fernando Ferrer conceded the election to Michael Bloomberg in a speech at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. Bloomberg was sworn in for a second term on January 1, 2006.

===Endorsements===
Bloomberg was endorsed by former mayors Rudy Giuliani and Ed Koch, Jeanine Pirro, Herman Badillo, former congressman Reverend Floyd Flake, Reverend Calvin Butts, and many prominent local Democrats who chose to cross party lines.

On October 23, Bloomberg was endorsed by both &quot;Newsday&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; for the general election. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Bloomberg could be &quot;one of the greatest mayors in New York history&quot;; however, &quot;The Times&quot; editorial board criticized &quot;his &#x27;obscene&#x27; unlimited spending on his political campaigns&quot;, creating an &quot;uneven playing field&quot;.

After winning the Democratic nomination, Ferrer was endorsed by Senators Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton on September 16. On September 19, Ferrer received the endorsement of SEIU Local 1199. He was endorsed by former mayor David Dinkins on September 23. Ferrer was endorsed by the Working Families Party on September 27, but did not appear on the Working Families Party line on Election Day. Andrew Cuomo endorsed Ferrer on September 29.

<text>Roman theatres derive from and are part of the overall evolution of earlier Greek theatres. Much of the architectural influence on the Romans came from the Greeks, and theatre structural design was no different from other buildings. However, Roman theatres have specific differences, such as generally being built upon their own foundations instead of earthen works or a hillside and being completely enclosed on all sides.

==Architecture==

Roman theatres were built in all areas of the Empire, from Spain to the Middle East. Because of the Romans&#x27; ability to influence local architecture, we see numerous theatres around the world with uniquely Roman attributes.

Similarities exist between the theatres and amphitheaters of ancient Rome. They were constructed out of the same material, Roman concrete, and provided a place for the public to go and see numerous events. However, they are two entirely different structures, with specific layouts that lend to the different events they held. Amphitheatres did not need superior acoustics, unlike those provided by the structure of a Roman theatre. While amphitheatres would feature races and gladiatorial events, theatres hosted events such as plays, pantomimes, choral events, orations, and commerce. Their design, with its semicircular form, enhances the natural acoustics, unlike Roman amphitheatres constructed in the round.

These buildings were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences depending on the region in which they were constructed. The &quot;scaenae frons&quot; was a high back wall of the stage floor, supported by columns. The &quot;proscaenium&quot; was a wall that supported the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the &quot;proscenium&quot;. The Roman theatre also had a &quot;podium&quot;, which sometimes supported the columns of the &quot;scaenae frons&quot;. The theatre itself was divided into the stage (&quot;orchestra&quot;) and the seating section (&quot;cavea&quot;). The &quot;cavea&quot; was sometimes constructed on a small hill or slope in which stacked seating could be easily made in the tradition of the Greek theatres. The center of the &quot;cavea&quot; was hollowed out of a hill or slope, while the outer radian seats required structural support and solid retaining walls. This was not always the case as Romans tended to build their theatres regardless of the availability of hillsides. All theatres built within the city of Rome were completely man-made without the use of earthworks. The &quot;cavea&quot; was not roofed, rather, awnings (&quot;velarium&quot;) could be pulled overhead to provide shelter from rain or sunlight. &quot;Vomitoria&quot;, passages situated below or behind a tier of seats, were made available to the audience.

Some Roman theatres, constructed of wood, were torn down after the festival for which they were erected concluded. This practice was due to a moratorium on permanent theatre structures that lasted until 55 BC when the Theatre of Pompey was built with the addition of a temple to avoid the law. Some Roman theatres show signs of never having been completed in the first place.

Inside Rome, few theatres have survived the centuries following their construction, providing little evidence about the specific theatres. The Roman Theatre of Orange in modern Orange, France, is a good example of a classic Roman theatre, with an indented &quot;scaenae frons&quot;, reminiscent of why Western Roman theatre designs, however, stripped of its ornamental stone columns and statues.

<text>In Jewish mythology, a  (; , from the Hebrew verb meaning &#x27;adhere&#x27; or &#x27;cling&#x27;) is a malicious possessing spirit believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. It supposedly leaves the host body once it has accomplished its goal, sometimes after being exorcised.

==Etymology==
 comes from the Hebrew word , meaning &#x27;a case of attachment&#x27;, which is a nominal form derived from the verb &#x27;to adhere&#x27; or &#x27;cling&#x27;.

==History==
The term first appears in a number of 16th-century writings, though it was ignored by mainstream scholarship until S. An-sky&#x27;s 1920 play &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; popularised the concept in literary circles. Earlier accounts of possession (such as that given by Josephus) were of demonic possession rather than that of ghosts. These accounts advocated orthodoxy among the populace as a preventative measure. &#x27;s 1937 film &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, based on the Yiddish play by S. An-sky, is considered one of the classics of Yiddish filmmaking.

Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, the Satmar rebbe (1887–1979), is reported to have supposedly advised an individual said to be possessed to consult a psychiatrist.

Traditionally, dybbuks tended to be male spirits. According to Hayyim Vital, women could not become dybbuks because their souls did not participate in gilgul. Sometimes these spirits were said to possess women on the eve of their weddings, typically in a sexual fashion by entering the women through their vaginas, which is seen in An-sky&#x27;s play. However, men and boys could be possessed as well.

In psychological literature, the has been described as a hysterical syndrome.

== Expulsion ==
In traditional Jewish communities, the concept of the dybbuk served as a socially acceptable way of expressing unacceptable urges, including sexual ones. Within Jewish mysticism and folklore, particularly in Kabbalistic traditions, protective practices were also used to ward off these malevolent spirits. One such practice involves affixing a mezuzah—a piece of parchment inscribed with specific Torah verses—to the doorposts of a home. While the mezuzah primarily serves as a reminder of faith and adherence to God&#x27;s commandments, it is also viewed as a protective amulet against harmful spirits, including dybbuks. The &quot;Zohar&quot;, a foundational Kabbalistic text, suggests that a properly affixed mezuzah can prevent such entities from entering a home. Additionally, Jewish folklore includes accounts where neglected or improperly maintained mezuzot were believed to make homes susceptible to dybbuk possession. These perspectives emphasize the mezuzah&#x27;s dual role in Jewish life: as both a symbol of faith and a spiritual safeguard.

<text>The Dybbuk&quot;, or &quot;Between Two Worlds (, trans. &quot;Mezh dvukh mirov [Dibuk]&quot;; , &quot;Tsvishn Tsvey Veltn – der Dibuk&quot;) is a play by S. An-sky, authored between 1913 and 1916. It was originally written in Russian and later translated into Yiddish by An-sky himself. &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; had its world premiere in that language, performed by the Vilna Troupe at Warsaw in 1920. A Hebrew version was prepared by Hayim Nahman Bialik and staged in Moscow at Habima Theater in 1922.

The play, which depicts the possession of a young woman by the malicious spirit – known as &quot;dybbuk&quot; in Jewish folklore – of her dead beloved, became a canonical work of both Hebrew and Yiddish theatre, being further translated and performed around the world.

== Plot summary ==

===Act I===
The play is set in the Jewish town (&quot;shtetl&quot;) of Brinitz, presumably near Miropol, Volhynia, in the Pale of Settlement. No date is mentioned, but it takes place after the death of , who is said to be &quot;of blessed memory&quot;, in 1882.

Three idlers lounge in the synagogue, telling stories of the famed hasidic &quot;Tzadikim&quot; and their mastery of Kabbalah powers. They are accompanied by the Messenger, a sinister stranger who demonstrates uncanny knowledge of the subject. Khanan, a dreamy, emaciated student, joins them. Upon seeing him, the three gossip of his reputed dealing with the secret lore. They discuss Leah, the daughter of rich Sender, whose suitors are constantly faced with new demands from her father until they despair. Khanan, who is obviously in love with her, rejoices when one of the idlers tells another proposed match came to nothing. Then Sender himself enters, announcing that he wavered but eventually closed the deal. The townspeople flock to congratulate him. Khanan is shocked, mumbling all his labors were in vain, but then something dawns on him and he is ecstatic. He falls to the floor. The townspeople are busy with Sender, but eventually notice Khanan and try to awake him. They discover he is dead, and that he clasped the Book of Raziel.

===Act II===
Several months later, Leah&#x27;s wedding day has arrived. As decreed by custom, a humble feast is held for the poor folk prior to the ceremony, and the maiden dances with the beggars. She and her nurse discuss the fate of the souls of those who died prematurely, mentioning Khanan who Leah says came to her in a dream. They visit the holy grave in the center of Brinitz, the resting place of a bride and a groom who were killed under their wedding canopy when the &quot;Evil Chmiel&quot; raided the area in 1648. She ceremoniously invites the souls of her mother and grandparents to her celebration. Menashe, her betrothed, arrives with his father. At the ceremony, he approaches to remove Leah&#x27;s veil. She shoves him back, screaming in a man&#x27;s voice. The Messenger, standing nearby, announces she is possessed by a &quot;Dybbuk&quot;.

===Act III===
In the home of the &quot;Tzadik&quot; Azriel of Miropol, the servant enters to announce that Sender&#x27;s possessed daughter has arrived. Azriel confides to his assistant that he is old and weak, but the latter encourages him with tales of his father and grandfather, both renowned miracle-workers. He calls Leah and demands from the spirit to leave her body. The &quot;Dybbuk&quot; refuses. Azriel recognizes him as Khanan, and summons the rabbinical court to place an anathema upon him. Rabbi Samson arrives and recounts that the spirit of Nisan, a scholar who died and knew the &quot;Tzadik&quot;, came to him in a dream. He told that Khanan is his son and he sues Sender before the court, on the charge he is responsible for his death. The rabbis determine to hold the litigation on the day after, and exorcise the spirit only upon discovering the truth.

===Act IV=== 
Nisan&#x27;s soul arrives at the court and communicates via Rabbi Samson. He tells the assembled that he and Sender were old friends, and swore that if one would father a son and the other a daughter, they will be married to each other. Nisan died prematurely, but his son Khanan arrived at Brinitz and his heart went after Leah, as was destined. He claims that Sender recognized him but did not want to have his daughter marry a poor man. Sender confides that he felt a strange urge to reject all suitors and take Khanan, but he eventually managed to resist it. Nisan pleads on, stating his desperate son turned to the Other Side and died, leaving him with none to say Kaddish after him.

The court absolves Sender, stating that one cannot promise an object not yet created under the laws of the Torah, but fine him severely and oblige him to say Kaddish for Nisan and Khanan for all his life. Azriel commands the spirit to exit Leah&#x27;s body, but it refuses. The holy man then conducts a dramatic exorcism, summoning various mystical entities and using ram horns&#x27; blasts and black candles. The &quot;Dybbuk&quot; is forced out. Menashe is invited, and a wedding is prepared. When Leah lies alone, she senses Khanan&#x27;s spirit and confides she loved him ever since seeing him for the first time. Mourning her never-to-be children, she rises and walks towards him. The two are united in death.

== Writing ==
Between 1912 and 1913, S. An-sky headed the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition, financed by Baron Vladimir Günzburg and named in honor of his father Horace Günzburg, which traveled through Podolia and Volhynia in the Pale of Settlement. They documented the oral traditions and customs of the native Jews, whose culture was slowly disintegrating under the pressure of modernity. According to his assistant Shmuel Shrira, An-sky was particularly impressed by the stories he heard in Miropol of a local sage, the hasidic rebbe Samuel of Kaminka-Miropol (1778 – May 10, 1843), who was reputed to have been a master exorcist of &quot;dybbuk&quot; spirits. Samuel served as the prototype for the character Azriel, who is also said to reside in that town. Historian Nathaniel Deutsch suggested he also drew inspiration from the Maiden of Ludmir, who was also rumored to have been possessed, thus explaining her perceived inappropriate manly behavior.

Craig Stephen Cravens deduced that An-sky began writing the play in late 1913. It was first mentioned in a reply to him from Baron Günzburg, on 12 February 1914, who commented he read a draft and found it compelling. The original was in Russian; shortly after completing it, the author was advised by friends to translate it into Yiddish. In the summer, he started promoting &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, hoping it would be staged by a major Russian theater. He was rebuffed by Semyon Vengerov of the Alexandrinsky Theatre, who explained they could not perform another play by a Jew after the negative reaction to Semyon Yushkevich&#x27;s &quot;Mendel Spivak&quot;. An-sky then contacted the managers of the Moscow Art Theatre. He failed to secure a meeting with Constantin Stanislavski himself, but director Leopold Sulerzhitsky read the play during the autumn, and replied much further work was required. Guided by him via correspondence, the author rewrote his piece through 1915. When he accepted the revised version in September, Sulerzhitsky regarded it as much better, but not satisfactory. At that time, An-sky&#x27;s publisher Zinovy Grzhebin submitted it to the state censorship in St. Petersburg. Censor Nikolai von Osten-Driesen commented the banishment of the spirit resembled the Exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac, and An-sky rewrote the scene using subtler terms. This version was approved by Driesen on 10 October, after removing another minor reference to angels. The play was still undergoing modifications: on 21 October, An-sky propositioned to Sulerzhitsky they add a prologue, epilogue and a long scene of Leah&#x27;s wedding day. He agreed, and the censor approved the expanded edition on 30 November. Both copies submitted by An-sky were found in 2001 at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts. They were considerably different from the known stage version: most notably, the Messenger was not yet conceived.

Stanislavski agreed to review the play, though not thoroughly, on 30 December. Though many accounts link him with &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, Cravens commented this is the only actual documentation in the matter. He never even watched &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; fully. He and the rest of the management continued to request revisions. On 25 November 1916, An-sky wrote in his diary that Stanislavski was almost pleased, asking but for only minor changes in the ending. On 8 January 1917, the press reported the Moscow Art Theatre accepted &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; and was preparing to stage it.

At the very same time, Stanislavski was supporting the incipient Habima Theater, a Hebrew-language venture headed by . An-sky read his play to Hillel Zlatopolsky, a patron of Habima, who purchased the rights to translate it to Hebrew. The author set but one condition, demanding it would be handed over to Hayim Nahman Bialik. The latter accepted the task in February and completed it in July. Bialik&#x27;s translation was the first version of the play to be published: it was released in the Hebrew literary magazine &quot;Ha&#x27;tkufa&quot; in February 1918. Meanwhile, the Moscow Art Theatre&#x27;s planned production of &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; encountered severe hardships. Michael Chekhov, cast as Azriel, had a severe nervous breakdown due to the use of extreme acting techniques; Stanislavski fell ill with typhus. On 7 March 1918, Boris Suskevich notified An-sky his play was not to be included in that season&#x27;s repertoire. The author left the city to Vilnius, losing his original copy on the way, but eventually receiving another from Shmuel Niger. He read his renewed edition before David Herman, director of the Vilna Troupe, but did not live to see it performed. He died on November 8, 1920.

== Stage productions ==
On 9 December, at the end of the thirty days&#x27; mourning after An-sky&#x27;s departure, Herman and his troupe staged the world premiere of &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; in Yiddish, at the Warsaw Elizeum Theater. Miriam Orleska, Alexander Stein, Abraham Morevsky and Noah Nachbusch portrayed Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger, respectively. The play turned into a massive success, drawing large audiences for over a year, from all the shades of society and a considerable number of Christians. A Yiddish columnist in Warsaw remarked that &quot;of every five Jews in the city, a dozen watched &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. How could this be? It is not a play you attend merely once.&quot; In the Polish capital alone, they staged it over three hundred times. During their tour across Europe between 1922 and 1927, it remained the pinnacle of their repertoire. While most of their acts drew few visitors, &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; remained an audience magnet.

On 1 September 1921, the play had its American premiere in the New York Yiddish Art Theatre of Maurice Schwartz. Celia Adler, Bar Galilee, Schwartz and Julius Adler appeared as Leah, Khanan, Azriel and the Messenger. It ran for several months.

While Habima Theater accepted Bialik&#x27;s translation much earlier, both the intricacy of the play and the production of others delayed its stagings. Director Yevgeny Vakhtangov planned it for years. He originally cast Shoshana Avivit (Lichtenstein), one of his young actresses, as Leah. Avivit was a notorious prima donna and an intimate friend of Bialik, and abandoned the theater unexpectedly on 21 March 1921, due to constant quarrels with the directors. She was confident that the management would call her back, but they dismissed her of the role of Leah, to Bialik&#x27;s chagrin; he ceased attending rehearsals. Vakhtangov gave the piece to Hanna Rovina, to the dismay of his associates, who considered the thirty-year-old actress too mature for portraying an eighteen-year-old Leah. Rovina was recovering from Tuberculosis in a sanatorium north of Moscow, and left the establishment in spite of the doctors&#x27; protests. Leah became her signature role. The Hebrew-language premiere was staged on 31 January 1922, at Habima&#x27;s residence in the Sekretariova Theater. Rovina, Miriam Elias (who was replaced by male actors in subsequent stagings), Shabtai Prudkin and Nachum Tzemach appeared in the four leading roles. Habima performed it precisely 300 times in the Soviet Union, 292 in Moscow; the last was on 18 January 1926, before it embarked on an international tour.

In the British Mandate of Palestine, it premiered in a makeshift production organized by a labor battalion paving Highway 75; while the exact date was unrecorded, it was sometime in February 1922. Abba Hushi depicted Azriel. Professional stagings soon followed suit. On the 6th and 16 June 1926, in two consecutive meetings, the members of the Hebrew Writers Union in Tel Aviv conducted &quot;the &quot;Dybbuk&quot; trial&quot;, a public debate attended by an audience of 5,000 people. They discussed the gap between the needs of the Zionist enterprise and the play&#x27;s atmosphere, voicing concern that it might overshadow the &quot;young Hebrew culture&quot; developing in Palestine, struggling to free itself from the constraints of diaspora mentality. Eventually, they approved the play.

The German-language premiere opened on 28 February 1925, in Vienna&#x27;s Rolandbühne, with Friedrich Feher as Azriel and Magda Sonja playing Leah. The first English production ran from 15 December 1925 and 1926 at the off-Broadway Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. It was translated and adapted by Henry G. Alsberg and Winifred Katzin. On 31 January 1928, Gaston Baty&#x27;s French-language version premiered in the Studio des Champs-Élysées.

In 1977, Joseph Chaikin, a central figure in American avant-garde theatre, directed a new translation of The Dybbuk by Mira Rafalowicz, a dramaturg, yiddishist and longtime collaborator of Chaikin&#x27;s at The Public Theater. The Royal Shakespeare Company staged Rafalowicz&#x27; translation, directed by Katie Mitchell, in 1992.

== Adaptations ==
Besides stories, An-sky also collected traditional melodies, one of which he incorporated into this play. When Aaron Copland attended a performance of the play in New York in 1929, he was struck by this melody and made it the basis of his piano trio &quot;Vitebsk&quot;, named for the town where An-sky was born.

In 1929 George Gershwin accepted a commission from the Metropolitan Opera to write an opera based on &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. When he was unable to acquire the rights (assigned to the Italian composer Lodovico Rocca, whose opera, &quot;Il Dibuk&quot;, was written on a libretto by Renato Simoni), he instead began work on his opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

In 1933, David Tamkin and Alex Tamkin adapted the play into the opera &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. It did not premiere until 1951.

In 1937, the play was adapted into the film &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, directed by Michał Waszyński and choreographed by Judith Berg.

On October 3, 1960, &quot;The Play of the Week&quot; presented &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, an English adaptation by Joseph Liss. It was directed by Sidney Lumet and starred Carol Lawrence.

In the early 1970s, Leon Katz created multiple adaptations of &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; (&quot;Toy Show&quot; and &quot;Shekhina: The Bride&quot;), both directed by Rina Yerushalmi and produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.

In 1974, Jerome Robbins created the ballet &quot;Dybbuk&quot; with music by Leonard Bernstein. That year, it was also adapted for CBS Radio Mystery Theater under the title &quot;The Demon Spirit&quot;.

In 1979 a version was made for &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; on BBC Radio 4 starring Cyril Shaps. The same year, a two-person adaptation by Bruce Myers won him an Obie when he performed it in New York. The Jewish Theatre San Francisco (formerly Traveling Jewish Theatre) also performed Myers&#x27; adaptation, winning several awards.

In 1980 the BBC aired the TV Movie &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, starring David Swift, Simon Callow and other notable actors of that era. It was well received and syndicated overseas.

In 1997, an Israeli film adaptation was produced under the name &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; or &quot;The Dybbuk of the Holy Apple Field&quot;, starring Israeli actors Yehezkel Lazarov and Ayelet Zurer in the leading roles. The film featured the song &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; by popular Israeli Mizrahi singer Zehava Ben, which went on to become a popular hit in Israel and, in its Arabic version, throughout the Middle East.

In November 1997 an adaptation by Tony Kushner and Joachim Neugroschel opened at The Public Theatre in New York.

In 1999 &quot;The Dybbuk: An opera in Yiddish&quot;, by American composer Solomon Epstein, premiered in Tel Aviv. This is apparently the world&#x27;s first original Yiddish opera.

In 1999, the Hollywood Theater of the Ear, under the direction of Yuri Rasovsky, recorded an English-language production, released by Dove Audio. It won the 2000 Audie Award for Audiobook Adapted from another Media.

In January 2008, the opera &quot;The Dybbuk: Between Two Worlds&quot;, by composer Ofer Ben-Amots, premiered in Montreal, Canada.

In May 2015, an adaptation by Canadian playwright Anton Piatigorsk opened at Toronto&#x27;s Soulpepper Theatre.

<text>Chromolithography is a method for making multi-colour prints. This type of colour printing stemmed from the process of lithography, and includes all types of lithography that are printed in colour. When chromolithography is used to reproduce photographs, the term photochrome is frequently used. Lithography is a method of printing on flat surfaces using a flat printing plate instead of raised relief or recessed intaglio techniques.

Chromolithography became the most successful of several methods of colour printing developed in the 19th century. Other methods were developed by printers such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon, George Baxter and Edmund Evans, and mostly relied on using several woodblocks with different colours. Hand-colouring also remained important. For example, elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were coloured by hand by boys until 1875. The initial chromolithographic technique involved the use of multiple lithographic stones, one for each colour, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best quality results. Depending on the number of colours present, a chromolithograph could take even very skilled workers months to produce.

However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying the number of colours used, and reducing the detail in the image. Cheaper images, like advertisements, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colours were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print, once referred to as a &quot;chromo&quot;, a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting, sometimes using dozens of layers.

Oleograph is sometimes used as a synonym for a chromolithograph, but more properly refers to a chromolithograph that has then been treated to imitate the variable surface of an oil painting, either by brushing with varnish, or some form of embossing or stamping. The print is usually glued to canvas to further the imitation.

==Process==
Chromolithography is a chemical process based on the rejection of water by grease. The image is applied to stone, grained zinc or aluminium surfaces, with a grease-based crayon or ink. Limestone and zinc are two commonly used materials in the production of chromolithographs, as aluminium production was limited before the invention of the Hall-Heroult process. After the image is drawn onto one of these surfaces, the image is gummed-up with a gum arabic solution and weak nitric acid to protect the remaining surface before inking up the image with oil based transfer or printing ink. Before final printing, the image is proof printed and any errors corrected. In the direct form of printing, the inked image is transferred under pressure onto a sheet of paper using a flat-bed press. The offset indirect method uses a rubber-covered cylinder that transfers the image from the printing surface to the paper. Colours may be overprinted by using additional stones or plates to achieve a closer reproduction of the original. Accurate registration for multi-coloured work is achieved by the use of a key outline image and registration bars which are applied to each stone or plate before drawing the solid or tone image. Ben-Day medium uses a raised gelatin stipple image to give tone gradation. An air-brush sprays ink to give soft edges. These are just two methods used to achieve gradations of tone. The use of twelve overprinted colours would not be considered unusual. Each sheet of paper will therefore pass through the printing press as many times as there are colours in the final print. In order that each colour is placed in the right position, each stone or plate must be precisely &#x27;registered,&#x27; or lined up, on the paper using a system of register marks.

Chromolithographs are considered to be reproductions that are smaller than double demi, and are of finer quality than lithographic drawings which are concerned with large posters. Autolithographs are prints where the artist draws and perhaps prints his own limited number of reproductions. This is the true lithographic art form.

==Origins==

Alois Senefelder, the inventor of lithography, introduced the subject of coloured lithography in his 1818 &quot;Vollstaendiges Lehrbuch der Steindruckerey (A Complete Course of Lithography)&quot;, where he told of his plans to print using colour and explained the colours he wished to be able to print someday. Although Senefelder recorded plans for chromolithography, printers in other countries, such as France and England, were also trying to find a new way to print in colour. Godefroy Engelmann of Mulhouse in France was awarded a patent on chromolithography in July 1837, but there are disputes over whether chromolithography was already in use before this date, as some sources say, pointing to areas of printing such as the production of playing cards.

==Arrival in the United States==
The first American chromolithograph—a portrait of Reverend F. W. P. Greenwood—was created by William Sharp in 1840. Many of the chromolithographs were created and purchased in urban areas. The prints were initially used as decoration in American parlours as well as for decoration within middle-class homes. They were prominent after the Civil War because of their low production costs and ability to be mass-produced, and because the methods allowed pictures to look more like hand-painted oil paintings. Production costs were only low if the chromolithographs were cheaply produced, but top-quality chromos were costly to produce because of the necessary months of work and the thousands of dollars worth of equipment that had to be used. Although chromos could be mass-produced, it took about three months to draw colours onto the stones and another five months to print a thousand copies. Chromolithographs became so popular in American culture that the era has been labeled as &quot;chromo civilization&quot;. Over time, during the Victorian era, chromolithographs populated children&#x27;s and fine arts publications, as well as advertising art, in trade cards, labels, and posters. They were also once used for advertisements, popular prints, and medical or scientific books.

==Opposition to chromolithography==
Even though chromolithographs served many uses within society at the time, many were opposed to the idea of them because of their perceived lack of authenticity. The new forms of art were sometimes tagged as &quot;bad art&quot; because of their deceptive qualities. Some also felt that it could not serve as a form of art at all since it was too mechanical, and that the true spirit of a painter could never be captured in a printed version of a work. Over time, many chromos came to be made so cheaply that they could no longer be confused with original paintings. Since production costs were low, the fabrication of cheap chromolithographs became more a business than the creation of art, in contrast with the high quality chromolithographs targeted primarily at art-oriented audiences.

==Notable printers==

===Louis Prang===
A famous lithographer and publisher who strongly supported the production of chromolithographs was Louis Prang. Prang was a German-born entrepreneur who printed the first American Christmas card. He felt that chromolithographs could look just as good as, if not better than, real paintings, and he published well-known chromolithographs based on popular paintings, including one by Eastman Johnson entitled &quot;The Barefoot Boy&quot;. The reason Prang decided to take on the challenge of producing chromolithographs, despite criticisms, was because he felt quality art should not be limited to the elite. Prang and others who continued to produce chromolithographs were sometimes looked down upon because of the fear that chromolithographs could undermine human abilities. With the Industrial Revolution already under way, this fear was not something new to Americans at the time. Many artists themselves anticipated the lack of desire for original artwork since many became accustomed to chromolithographs. As a way to make more sales, some artists had a few paintings made into chromolithographs so that people in society would at least be familiar with the painter. Once people in society were familiar with the artist, they were more likely to want to pay for an original work.

===Lothar Meggendorfer===
German chromolithographers, largely based in Bavaria, came to dominate the trade with their low-cost high-volume productions. Of these printers, Lothar Meggendorfer garnered international fame for his children&#x27;s educational books and games. Owing to political unrest in mid-19th century Germany, many Bavarian printers emigrated to the United Kingdom and the United States, and Germany&#x27;s monopoly on chromolithographic printing dissipated.

===August Hoen===
A. Hoen &amp; Co., led by German immigrant August Hoen, were a prominent lithography house now known primarily for its stunning E.T. Paull sheet music covers. They also made advertisements, maps, and cigar box art. Hoen and his brothers Henry and Ernest took over the E. Weber Company in the mid-1850s upon Edward Weber&#x27;s death. August Hoen&#x27;s son Alfred ran the firm from 1886 throughout the early 20th century.

===Rufus Bliss===
Rufus Bliss founded R. Bliss Mfg. Co., which was located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island from 1832 to 1914.
The Bliss company is best known for their highly sought after paper litho on wood dollhouses. They also made many other lithoed toys, including boats, trains, and building blocks.

===M. &amp; N. Hanhart===
Established in Mulhouse in 1830 by Michael Hanhart who initially worked with Godefroy Engelmann in London. The firm, established at Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, was named after his two sons Michael and Nicholas. Artists like Joseph Wolf, Joseph Smit, J G Keulemans and others worked for him to produce natural history illustrations that were used in the Ibis (1859–1874), Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London (1848–1900) and a range of books. The company wound up in 1902 after the death of Nicholas Hanhart and the rise of new printing techniques.

==Uses==

Chromolithographs are mainly used today as fine art instead of advertisements, and they are hard to find because of poor preservation and the cheaper forms of printing that replaced them. Many chromolithographs have deteriorated because of the acidic frames surrounding them. As stated earlier, production costs of chromolithographs were low, but efforts were still being made to find a cheaper and faster way to mass-produce coloured prints. Although purchasing a chromolithograph may have been cheaper than purchasing a painting, it was still expensive in comparison to other colour printing methods which were later developed. Offset printing replaced chromolithography in the late 1930s.

To find or purchase a lithograph, some suggest searching for examples with the original frame as well as the publisher&#x27;s stamp. Both European and American chromolithographs can still be found, and can range in cost from hundreds to thousands of dollars. The least expensive chromos tend to be European or produced by publishers who are less well-known compared to Prang.

<doc id="714050" wikidata="Q570779" url="?curid=714050" title="Vieta's formulas">
<text>In mathematics, Vieta&#x27;s formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. They are named after François Viète (more commonly referred to by the Latinised form of his name, &quot;Franciscus Vieta&quot;).

==Basic formulas==
Any general polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot;
formula_1
(with the coefficients being real or complex numbers and ) has (not necessarily distinct) complex roots by the fundamental theorem of algebra. Vieta&#x27;s formulas relate the polynomial coefficients to signed sums of products of the roots as follows:
{a_n} \\[1ex]
(r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + \cdots + r_1 r_n) + (r_2r_3 + r_2r_4+\cdots + r_2r_n)+\cdots + r_{n-1}r_n = \dfrac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}} \\[1ex]
{} \quad \vdots \\[1ex]
r_1 r_2 \cdots r_n = (-1)^n \dfrac{a_0}{a_n}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Vieta&#x27;s formulas can equivalently be written as 
formula_2
for (the indices are sorted in increasing order to ensure each product of roots is used exactly once).

The left-hand sides of Vieta&#x27;s formulas are the elementary symmetric polynomials of the roots.

Vieta&#x27;s system can be solved by Newton&#x27;s method through an explicit simple iterative formula, the Durand-Kerner method.

==Generalization to rings==
Vieta&#x27;s formulas are frequently used with polynomials with coefficients in any integral domain . Then, the quotients formula_3 belong to the field of fractions of (and possibly are in itself if formula_4 happens to be invertible in ) and the roots formula_5 are taken in an algebraically closed extension. Typically, is the ring of the integers, the field of fractions is the field of the rational numbers and the algebraically closed field is the field of the complex numbers.

Vieta&#x27;s formulas are then useful because they provide relations between the roots without having to compute them.

For polynomials over a commutative ring that is not an integral domain, Vieta&#x27;s formulas are only valid when formula_4 is not a zero-divisor and formula_7 factors as formula_8. For example, in the ring of the integers modulo 8, the quadratic polynomial formula_9 has four roots: 1, 3, 5, and 7. Vieta&#x27;s formulas are not true if, say, formula_10 and formula_11, because formula_12. However, formula_7 does factor as formula_14 and also as formula_15, and Vieta&#x27;s formulas hold if we set either formula_10 and formula_17 or formula_18 and formula_19.

==Example==
Vieta&#x27;s formulas applied to quadratic and cubic polynomials:

The roots formula_20 of the quadratic polynomial formula_21 satisfy
formula_22

The first of these equations can be used to find the minimum (or maximum) of ; see .

The roots formula_23 of the cubic polynomial formula_24 satisfy
formula_25

==Proof==
=== Direct proof ===
Vieta&#x27;s formulas can be proved by considering the equality
formula_26
(which is true since formula_27 are all the roots of this polynomial), expanding the products in the right-hand side, and equating the coefficients of each power of formula_28 between the two members of the equation.

Formally, if one expands formula_29 the terms are precisely formula_30 where formula_31 is either 0 or 1, accordingly as whether formula_5 is included in the product or not, and &quot;k&quot; is the number of formula_5 that are included, so the total number of factors in the product is &quot;n&quot; (counting formula_34 with multiplicity &quot;k&quot;) – as there are &quot;n&quot; binary choices (include formula_5 or &quot;x&quot;), there are formula_36 terms – geometrically, these can be understood as the vertices of a hypercube. Grouping these terms by degree yields the elementary symmetric polynomials in formula_5 – for &quot;xk,&quot; all distinct &quot;k&quot;-fold products of formula_38

As an example, consider the quadratic
formula_39

Comparing identical powers of formula_28, we find formula_41, formula_42 and formula_43, with which we can for example identify formula_44 and formula_45, which are Vieta&#x27;s formula&#x27;s for formula_46.

=== Proof by mathematical induction ===
Vieta&#x27;s formulas can also be proven by induction as shown below.

Inductive hypothesis:

Let formula_47 be polynomial of degree formula_48, with complex roots formula_49 and complex coefficients formula_50 where formula_51. Then the inductive hypothesis is thatformula_52

Base case, formula_53 (quadratic):

Let formula_54 be coefficients of the quadratic and formula_55be the constant term. Similarly, let formula_56 be the roots of the quadratic:formula_57Expand the right side using distributive property:formula_58Collect like terms:formula_59Apply distributive property again:formula_60The inductive hypothesis has now been proven true for formula_61.

Induction step:

Assuming the inductive hypothesis holds true for all formula_62, it must be true for all formula_63.formula_64By the factor theorem, formula_65 can be factored out of formula_66 leaving a 0 remainder. Note that the roots of the polynomial in the square brackets are formula_67:formula_68Factor out formula_69, the leading coefficient formula_7, from the polynomial in the square brackets:formula_71For simplicity sake, allow the coefficients and constant of polynomial be denoted as formula_72:formula_73Using the inductive hypothesis, the polynomial in the square brackets can be rewritten as:formula_74Using distributive property:formula_75After expanding and collecting like terms:formula_76The inductive hypothesis holds true for formula_77, therefore it must be true formula_78

Conclusion:formula_79By dividing both sides by formula_80, it proves the Vieta&#x27;s formulas true.

== History ==
A method similar to Vieta&#x27;s formula can be found in the work of the 12th century Arabic mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi. It is plausible that the algebraic advancements made by Arabic mathematicians such as al-Khayyam, al-Tusi, and al-Kashi influenced 16th-century algebraists, with Vieta being the most prominent among them.

The formulas were derived by the 16th-century French mathematician François Viète, for the case of positive roots.

In the opinion of the 18th-century British mathematician Charles Hutton, as quoted by Funkhouser, the general principle (not restricted to positive real roots) was first understood by the 17th-century French mathematician Albert Girard: 
...[Girard was] the first person who understood the general doctrine of the formation of the coefficients of the powers from the sum of the roots and their products. He was the first who discovered the rules for summing the powers of the roots of any equation.

<doc id="714053" wikidata="Q845870" url="?curid=714053" title="Transduction (genetics)">
<text>Transduction is the process by which foreign DNA is introduced into a cell by a virus or viral vector. An example is the viral transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another and hence an example of horizontal gene transfer. Transduction does not require physical contact between the cell donating the DNA and the cell receiving the DNA (which occurs in conjugation), and it is DNase resistant (transformation is susceptible to DNase). Transduction is a common tool used by molecular biologists to stably introduce a foreign gene into a host cell&#x27;s genome (both bacterial and mammalian cells).

== Discovery (bacterial transduction) ==

Transduction was discovered in &quot;Salmonella&quot; by Norton Zinder and Joshua Lederberg at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1952.

== In the lytic and lysogenic cycles ==

Transduction happens through either the lytic cycle or the lysogenic cycle.
When bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) that are lytic infect bacterial cells, they harness the replicational, transcriptional, and translation machinery of the host bacterial cell to make new viral particles (virions). The new phage particles are then released by lysis of the host. In the lysogenic cycle, the phage chromosome is integrated as a prophage into the bacterial chromosome, where it can stay dormant for extended periods of time. If the prophage is induced (by UV light for example), the phage genome is excised from the bacterial chromosome and initiates the lytic cycle, which culminates in lysis of the cell and the release of phage particles. Generalized transduction (see below) occurs in both cycles during the lytic stage, while specialized transduction (see below) occurs when a prophage is excised in the lysogenic cycle.&quot;

== As a method for transferring genetic material ==

=== Transduction by bacteriophages ===

The packaging of bacteriophage DNA into phage capsids has low fidelity. Small pieces of bacterial DNA may be packaged into the bacteriophage particles. There are two ways that this can lead to transduction.

====Generalized transduction====

Generalized transduction occurs when random pieces of bacterial DNA are packaged into a phage. It happens when a phage is in the lytic stage, at the moment that the viral DNA is packaged into phage heads. If the virus replicates using &#x27;headful packaging&#x27;, it attempts to fill the head with genetic material. If the viral genome results in spare capacity, viral packaging mechanisms may incorporate bacterial genetic material into the new virion. Alternatively, generalized transduction may occur via recombination. Generalized transduction is a rare event and occurs on the order of 1 phage in 11,000.

The new virus capsule that contains part bacterial DNA then infects another bacterial cell. When the bacterial DNA packaged into the virus is inserted into the recipient cell three things can happen to it:

# The DNA is recycled for spare parts.
# If the DNA was originally a plasmid, it will re-circularize inside the new cell and become a plasmid again.
# If the new DNA matches with a homologous region of the recipient cell&#x27;s chromosome, it will exchange DNA material similar to the actions in bacterial recombination.

====Specialized transduction====

&quot;Specialized transduction&quot; is the process by which a &quot;restricted&quot; set of bacterial genes is transferred to another bacterium. Those genes that are located adjacent to the prophage are transferred due to improper excision. Specialized transduction occurs when a prophage excises imprecisely from the chromosome so that bacterial genes lying adjacent to it are included in the excised DNA. The excised DNA along with the viral DNA is then packaged into a new virus particle, which is then delivered to a new bacterium when the phage attacks new bacterium. Here, the donor genes can be inserted into the recipient chromosome or remain in the cytoplasm, depending on the nature of the bacteriophage.

An example of specialized transduction is λ phage in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

====Lateral transduction====

&quot;Lateral transduction&quot; is the process by which very long fragments of bacterial DNA are transferred to another bacterium. So far, this form of transduction has been only described in &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, but it can transfer more genes and at higher frequencies than generalized and specialized transduction. In lateral transduction, the prophage starts its replication in situ before excision in a process that leads to replication of the adjacent bacterial DNA. After which, packaging of the replicated phage from its &quot;pac&quot; site (located around the middle of the phage genome) and adjacent bacterial genes occurs in situ, to 105% of a phage genome size. Successive packaging after initiation from the original &quot;pac&quot; site leads to several kilobases of bacterial genes being packaged into new viral particles that are transferred to new bacterial strains. If the transferred genetic material in these transducing particles provides sufficient DNA for homologous recombination, the genetic material will be inserted into the recipient chromosome.
Because multiple copies of the phage genome are produced during in situ replication, some of these replicated prophages excise normally (instead of being packaged in situ), producing normal infectious phages.

=== Mammalian cell transduction with viral vectors ===

Transduction with viral vectors can be used to insert or modify genes in mammalian cells. It is often used as a tool in basic research and is actively researched as a potential means for gene therapy.

====Process====

In these cases, a plasmid is constructed in which the genes to be transferred are flanked by viral sequences that are used by viral proteins to recognize and package the viral genome into viral particles. This plasmid is inserted (usually by transfection) into a producer cell together with other plasmids (DNA constructs) that carry the viral genes required for the formation of infectious virions. In these producer cells, the viral proteins expressed by these packaging constructs bind the sequences on the DNA/RNA (depending on the type of viral vector) to be transferred and insert it into viral particles. For safety, none of the plasmids used contains all the sequences required for virus formation, so that simultaneous transfection of multiple plasmids is required to get infectious virions. Moreover, only the plasmid carrying the sequences to be transferred contains signals that allow the genetic materials to be packaged in virions so that none of the genes encoding viral proteins are packaged. Viruses collected from these cells are then applied to the cells to be altered. The initial stages of these infections mimic infection with natural viruses and lead to expression of the genes transferred and (in the case of lentivirus/retrovirus vectors) insertion of the DNA to be transferred into the cellular genome. However, since the transferred genetic material does not encode any of the viral genes, these infections do not generate new viruses (the viruses are &quot;replication-deficient&quot;).

Some enhancers have been used to improve transduction efficiency such as polybrene, protamine sulfate, retronectin, and DEAE Dextran.

<doc id="714055" wikidata="Q183448" url="?curid=714055" title="Architrave">
<text>In classical architecture, an architrave (; , also called an epistyle; ) is the lintel or beam, typically made of wood or stone, that rests on the capitals of columns.

The term can also apply to all sides, including the vertical members, of a frame with mouldings around a door or window. The word &quot;architrave&quot; has come to be used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings (or other elements) framing a door, window or other rectangular opening, where the horizontal &quot;head&quot; casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join (forming a butt joint, as opposed to a miter joint).

== Classical architecture ==
In an entablature in classical architecture, it is the lowest part, below the frieze and cornice. The word is derived from the Greek and Latin words &quot;arche&quot; and &quot;trabs&quot; combined to mean &quot;main beam&quot;. The architrave is different in the different Classical orders. In the Tuscan order, it only consists of a plain face, crowned with a fillet, and is half a module in height. In the Doric and Composite order, it has two faces, or fasciae, and three in the Ionic and Corinthian order, in which it is 10/12 of a module high, though but half a module in the rest.
== Metaphorical use ==
The term &quot;architrave&quot; has also been used in academic writing to mean the fundamental part of something (a speech, a thought or a reasoning), or the basis upon which an idea, reasoning, thought or philosophy is built.

Examples:
# &quot;...the Mature Hegel – the Hegel of the Philosophy of Right – who becomes the architrave on which he &quot;(Honneth, ed.)&quot; constructs his social philosophy.&quot;
#&quot;to become the architrave of his theoretic construction&quot;

== Modern architraves ==
In contemporary architecture and interior design, the term &quot;architrave&quot; also refers to the mouldings that frame doors and windows. Unlike classical architraves, which were primarily structural and often ornate, modern architraves are typically decorative and functional, concealing the gap between the wall and the door or window frame.

=== Materials ===
Modern architraves are commonly made from:
* MDF (Medium-Density Fibreboard): A popular choice due to its affordability, smooth surface, and ease of painting. 
* Wood: A traditional material often used for premium finishes, including oak, pine, and other hardwoods.
* PVC or uPVC: Commonly used in areas prone to moisture, such as bathrooms, due to its durability and resistance to warping.

=== Styles ===
Modern architraves are available in a variety of styles to suit different interior design preferences:
* Simple Flat Profiles: Minimalist designs for modern and contemporary interiors. 
* Ogee and Torus Profiles: Decorative mouldings used in more traditional or classic interiors.
* Custom Profiles: Bespoke designs created to match specific architectural or design requirements.

=== Function ===
Modern architraves serve both aesthetic and practical purposes:
# Concealing gaps between the wall and the frame of a door or window.
# Protecting edges from damage.
# Enhancing the overall aesthetic of an interior space.

Modern architraves are typically installed after the walls have been finished (plastered and painted) but before flooring is laid. They are often painted or finished to match or complement the doors and walls they surround. 

== Indian architecture ==
In śilpaśāstra, the Hindu texts on architecture, the architrave is commonly referred to by its Sanskrit name &quot;uttara&quot;. In Hindu temple architecture it is placed above the bracket (&quot;potika&quot;) of a pillar (&quot;stambha&quot;), which gives it extra support. The Indian entablature is called &quot;prastara&quot;.

Dravidian architecture recognizes several distinct types of architraves:

* rounded (&quot;vṛttapotika&quot;)
* wavy (&quot;taraṅgapotika&quot;)
* flower shaped (&quot;puṣpapotika&quot;)
* bevel and tenon type (&quot;ādhārapotika&quot;)
* voluted (&quot;muṣṭibanda&quot;)
* figural (&quot;citrapotika&quot;)

<text>Shloyme Zanvl Rappoport (1863 – November 8, 1920), also known by his pen name S. An-sky, was a Jewish author, playwright, researcher of Jewish folklore, polemicist, and cultural and political activist. He is best known for his play &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; or &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot;, written in 1914, and for Di Shvue, the anthem of the Jewish socialist Bund. In 1912-1914, he led the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition to the Pale of Settlement.

In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, he was elected to the Russian Constituent Assembly as a Social-Revolutionary deputy.

==Biography==

Shloyme Zanvl Rappoport was born in Chashniki, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire (now Belarus), but spent his childhood in Vitebsk. He was from a poor religious family, and he had only a heder education. His mother ran a tavern. He left his home and moved to Liozno in his late-teens, and worked as a tutor; he was ostracised by his community for &quot;disseminating radical ideas&quot;. He wrote his first novel, &quot;History of a Family&quot;, in Yiddish, it was translated and published in Russian in 1884.

Rappoport was actively involved in revolutionary movements, initially as a populist (known as narodniki) and later as a member of the Socialist Revolutionary (SR) Party. At this time, he changed his name from Jewish to Russian, Semyon Akimovich. In 1880s, in the spirit of Going to the People movement, popular among populists, he moved to Ekaterinoslav region, where he worked as a tutor and in the &quot;salt- and coal-mining industry&quot;. He believed in the importance of education of Russia&#x27;s peasants and participated in activities such as collecting workers&#x27; songs and giving public readings, which led to his arrest in 1888. In 1892, he was introduced to the literary circles of St. Petersburg, where he started to write under a pen name S. An-sky. He moved to Paris in 1892, and lived in Europe until 1905. He mainly wrote in Russian, but eventually started to write in Yiddish too. He also worked as a secretary for Russian philosopher Petr Lavrov in Paris. He had a short marriage to a &quot;French-Russian woman&quot;. After Lavrov&#x27;s death, An-sky movet to Switzerland, where, together with Viktor Chernov, he founded a populist Agrarian Socialist League. In 1904-1905, he was an editor of Yiddish socialist journal &quot;Kampf un kempfer&quot; (The Fight and the Fighters).

An-sky returned to Russia in 1905, after the revolution. He debated prominent figures like Simon Dubnow, Chaim Zhitlowsky, and Shmuel Niger on various issues, including Jewish revolutionary dedication, Christian imagery in Jewish literature, and the trilingual vision of modern Jewish literature. An-sky also became active in Jewish publishing, editing and contributing to several Jewish journals and encyclopedias. From 1908 to 1918, he traveled extensively, lecturing on Jewish cultural topics while remaining involved in Socialist Revolutionary politics. He published works on anarchism and revolutionary plays, and was arrested in 1907 &quot;for disseminating revolutionary propaganda&quot;. He had another failed marriage in 1908, to Esther Glezerman.

In 1912-1914, An-sky with a small team went for an ethnographic expeditions to the Pale of Settlement, collecting thousands of photographs, folk tales, songs, and artefacts. Based on the collected materials, An-sky wrote his most famous work, play &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;. It was soon translated to Yiddish, and is now regarded as one of the most famous plays of the Yiddish theatre.

During the World War I and until the October Revolution of 1917, An-sky worked for Jewish Committee for the Relief of War Victims; in 1920 he published his memoir of this times, &quot;Khurbn Galitsye&quot; (The Destruction of Galicia). After the revolution, he escaped to Vilna and then to Warsaw, where he died of a heart attack on November 8, 1920.

==Ethnographic work==

Under the influence of the Russian narodniki movement, An-sky became interested in ethnography, as well as socialism, and became a political activist. Between 1912 and 1913, An-sky headed the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition, financed by Baron Vladimir Günzburg and named in honor of his father Horace Günzburg, which traveled through Podolia and Volhynia in the Pale of Settlement. They documented the oral traditions and customs of the native Jews, whose culture was slowly disintegrating under the pressure of modernity. According to his assistant Samuel Schreier-Shrira, An-sky was particularly impressed by the stories he heard in Miropol of a local sage, the hasidic rebbe Samuel of Kaminka-Miropol (1778 – May 10, 1843), who was reputed to have been a master exorcist of &quot;dybbuk&quot; spirits. Samuel served as the prototype for the character Azriel, who is also said to reside in that town. Historian Nathaniel Deutsch suggested he also drew inspiration for &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; from the Maiden of Ludmir, who was also rumored to have been possessed, thus explaining her perceived inappropriate manly behavior. He composed a detailed ethnographic questionnaire of 2,087 questions.

An-sky&#x27;s ethnographic collections were locked away in Soviet vaults for years, but some material has come to light since the 1990s. The State Ethnographic Museum at St. Petersburg holds a good deal of it. Some of his vast collection of cylinder recordings made on these expeditions were digitized by the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine, which holds the collection. Deutsch compares the An-sky&#x27;s expedition materials to genizah, particularly to the Cairo genizah.

His ethnographic report of the deliberate destruction of Jewish communities by the Russian army in the First World War, &quot;Khurbn Galitsiye&quot; (The Destruction of Galicia), has become a major source in the historiography of the war&#x27;s impact on civilian populations.

==Literary career==

Initially he wrote in Russian, but from 1904 he became known mainly as a Yiddish author.

He is best known for his play &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; or &quot;Between Two Worlds&quot;, written in 1914. The play was first staged in the Elyseum Theatre in Warsaw, on December 9, 1920, one month (at the end of the 30-day mourning period) after the author&#x27;s death. It was subsequently translated into a dozen or more languages and performed thousands of times all over the world. It is still being produced, along with numerous adaptations, as well as operas, ballets, and symphonic suites. (For example, in 2011 there were seven different productions.) It is considered the jewel of the Jewish theatre. In the early years &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; was considered so significant that parodies of it were written and produced.

Although &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; is An-sky’s best-known work, he published many works of literature, politics and ethnography. His &quot;Collected Works&quot;, which do not include all his writings, comprise fifteen volumes. An-sky wrote a number of other plays, four of which are included in this collection, long out of print. One (&quot;Day and Night&quot;) is, like &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, a Hasidic Gothic story. The other three plays have revolutionary themes, and were originally written in Russian: &quot;Father and Son&quot;, &quot;In a Conspiratorial Apartment&quot;, and &quot;The Grandfather&quot;. All four have recently been republished in a bilingual Yiddish-English edition.

An-sky was also the author of the song &quot;Di Shvue&quot; (The Oath), which became the anthem of the Jewish Socialist Bund party. He was the author of the poem (later made into a song) &quot;In Zaltsikn Yam&quot; (In the Salty Sea), which was also dedicated to the Bund.

<doc id="714063" wikidata="Q6117237" url="?curid=714063" title="Jackson Mac Low">
<text>Jackson Mac Low (1922 – December 8, 2004) was an American poet, performance artist, composer and playwright, known to most readers of poetry as a practitioner of systematic chance operations and other non-intentional compositional methods in his work, which Mac Low first experienced in the musical work of John Cage, Earle Brown, and Christian Wolff. He was married to the artist Iris Lezak from 1962 to 1978, and to the poet Anne Tardos from 1990 until his death.

An early affiliate of Fluxus (he co-published &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot;) and stylistic progenitor of the Language poets, Mac Low cultivated ties with an eclectic array of notable figures in the postwar American avant-garde, including Nam June Paik, Kathy Acker, Allen Ginsberg, and Arthur Russell. His work has been published in more than 90 anthologies and periodicals and read publicly, exhibited, performed, and broadcast in North and South America, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. He read, performed, and lectured in New York and throughout North America, Europe, and New Zealand, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Asnières, Paris, Bouliac (near Bordeaux), Marseilles, Buffalo, Philadelphia, and New York.

==Life==
Mac Low received his associate&#x27;s degree from the University of Chicago in 1941—where he continued to take graduate courses in philosophy and literature into 1943—and his bachelor&#x27;s degree in ancient Greek from the evening division of Brooklyn College in 1958. The higher degree allowed Mac Low to support his artistic career as an instructor of English as a second language at New York University from 1966-1973 and as a reference book editor for many publishers, including Knopf, Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Pantheon, Bantam, and Macmillan.

In 1965, Mac Low gave lectures on mousike for the newly founded Free University of New York.

From 1964 through 1980, Mac Low participated as a visual artist, composer, poet, and performer in the Annual Festivals of the Avant-Garde in New York. In 1968, he signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. His work was published in 0 to 9 magazine, an avant-garde publication that experimented with language and meaning-making. In 1969 he produced computer-assisted poetry for the Art and Technology Program of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Beginning in 1981, Mac Low and Anne Tardos wrote, directed, and performed in seven radioworks.

In 1986, he received a Fulbright travel grant for New Zealand, where he was the keynote speaker at the Australia and New Zealand American Studies Association conference at the University of Auckland. He also participated in a composers&#x27; conference and led a workshop in Nelson, New Zealand. He read, performed, was interviewed, and led workshops in Wellington, Dunedin, and Auckland as well.

In 1989, Mac Low participated in the Fine Arts Festival at the University of North Carolina. From 1990 to 1991, Mac Low served on the poetry panel of the New York Foundation for the Arts. In 1993, Mac Low and Anne Tardos gave a joint concert of their works for voices with prerecorded tapes at Experimental Intermedia, New York City. In January 1996, he presented readings and performances at Cowell College of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

In 2000, Mac Low performed two readings of his poetry at the Bjørnson Festival 2000 in Molde, Norway. He also unveiled a monument to Kurt Schwitters on an island off Molde.

==Posthumously published work==
In 2008, &quot;Thing of Beauty: New and Selected Works&quot; was published, edited by Anne Tardos.

In 2012, Counterpath Press released &quot;154 Forties&quot;, a collection of poems written and revised by Mac Low between 1990 and 2001, edited by Anne Tardos. Counterpath also completed a project of shooting videos of contemporary poets and artists reading the Forties.

In 2015, Chax Press released &quot;THE COMPLETE LIGHT POEMS: 1–60&quot; , edited by Anne Tardos and Michael O&#x27;Driscoll.

==Composition==
One type of non-intentional composition that he used relied on an algorithm he dubbed &quot;diastic&quot;, by analogy to acrostic. He used words or phrases drawn from source material to spell out a source word or phrase, with the first word having the first letter of the source, the second word having the second letter, and so forth, reading through (&quot;dia&quot; in Greek) the source. During the last 25 years of his life, he often collaborated with Anne Tardos.

=== Chance operations ===
Jackson Mac Low is known for using chance and experimentation in the production of his diastic poems. He engaged in projects that would extract words from the work of other poets and writers through a specific system he devised in order to produce a new poem. He would often extract these words from texts he was reading on the subway during his commutes. One such example is Mac Low&#x27;s &quot;Call Me Ishmael&quot;, developed from the source text &quot;Moby Dick&quot; by Herman Melville. &quot;Call Me Ishmael&quot; is a phrase from &quot;Loomings&quot;, the first chapter of the book. Mac Low moved chronologically through the book after finding the phrase extracted from the source text, &quot;Call Me Ishmael,&quot; and allowing the first letter of each word in each stanza to spell out &quot;Call Me Ishmael.&quot; Additionally, he played with the repetition of the letter &quot;L&quot; in the third and fourth word of each stanza by allowing the fourth word to repeat the third. For example, the poem starts with the line &quot;Circulation. And long long&quot;, spelling out the first part of the source-text phrase, &quot;Call.&quot;

Mac Low&#x27;s interest in chance operations within poetry led him to adopt new experimentation techniques during his work on the &quot;Stein&quot; series. He used &quot;A Million Random Digits With 100,000 Normal Deviates&quot;, a book of random numbers developed to aid in the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, to randomly rearrange and rewrite text by Gertrude Stein in a series of poems. He originally discovered &quot;A Million Random Digits&quot; in 1958 and used it in work throughout his life. The &quot;Stein&quot; series, between 1998 and 2003, marks one of his final projects.
Despite their mechanical nature, many of these chance poems open up space for sentimentality and delicate interpretation. One example of this is Jackson Mac Low&#x27;s &quot;Light Poems&quot; that consisted of sentences randomly chosen from a chart documenting different kinds of light. In &quot;32nd Light Poem: &quot;In Memorandum&quot; Paul Blackburn 9-10 October 1971,&quot; Mac Low uses this system of chance to pay respects to a late friend. The poem goes: &quot;Let me choose the kinds of light/ to light the passing of my friend.&quot; Although the process appears mechanical, the poems themselves reveal grief and other emotions that appear to be at odds with the process by which they were developed.

=== Connection to anarchism ===
Jackson Mac Low was invested in pushing the boundaries of author and audience. He regularly asserted that the author is not responsible for producing meaning, but rather creating the environment for the audience to extract a unique interpretation. He was interested in the dynamic between chance and choice within syntax. Works produced by chance allow the performers of the poem to have their own sense of determinism, which reflects Mac Low&#x27;s own anarchist affiliations. Speaking on this dynamic between the author and performers, Mac Low stated:&quot;Although performers are not directly regulated by a central authority, eventually they are, since I as the composer am giving them the materials, procedures, rules, etc. This is why I usually say these days that such performances are &quot;analogies&quot; rather than &quot;paradigms&quot; of free communities. Nevertheless, they&#x27;re exercising their own initiative within the situation, the given materials being analogies of the real-life conditions provided by nature and society.&quot;Within Mac Low&#x27;s work, he disrupts subjectivity through the use of chance operations and the responsibility to extract and enact meaning falls on the role of the reader. Because of this, the reader functions more as performer than the author. For Mac Low, this method of producing poetry reflects his anarchist engagements because it dismantles the power structure between reader and author and serves as an analogy for a free community in which people make their own choices for how to live and structure their thinking and decisions.

=== Connection to Buddhism ===
Mac Low used chance operations as a way to distance himself from choice, therefore habit. Whether conscious or unconscious, these habitual decisions rooted in personal history create limitations for an individual. Mac Low rejected choice in order to reduce the habitual process of decision-making. This idea is rooted in Buddhism in which one achieves enlightenment through discovery outside of one&#x27;s habits, culture, and personal history and the achievement of a greater sense of generality. Mac Low&#x27;s use of chance operations allows for a greater degree of universality. Although the language used is not universal, the operations used to produce the poems can be applied to a variety of contexts.

==Awards==
In 1985, Mac Low won a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1988, he was awarded a Fellowship in Poetry by the New York Foundation for the Arts. He shared an America Award with Robert Creeley&#x27;s &quot;Echoes&quot; for a book of poetry published in 1994.
In 1999, he received a Dorothea Tanning Award from The Academy of American Poets and a Wallace Stevens award.

== Personal life ==

Mac Low was a pacifist and &quot;anarchist-populist&quot;.

<doc id="714064" wikidata="Q636008" url="?curid=714064" title="Archivolt">
<text>An archivolt (or voussure) is an ornamental moulding or band following the curve on the underside of an arch. It is composed of bands of ornamental mouldings (or other architectural elements) surrounding an arched opening, corresponding to the architrave in the case of a rectangular opening. The word is sometimes used to refer to the under-side or inner curve of the arch itself (more properly, the &quot;intrados&quot;). Most commonly archivolts are found as a feature of the arches of church portals. The mouldings and sculptures on these archivolts are used to convey a theological story or depict religious figures and ideologies of the church in order to represent the gateway between the holy space of the church and the external world. The presence of archivolts on churches is seen throughout history, although their design, both architecturally and artistically, is heavily influenced by the period they were built in and the churches they were designed for.

==Etymology==
The word originates in the Italian (or French) equivalents of the English words &quot;arch&quot; and &quot;vault&quot;.

==Structural features==
Archivolts are usually found as a part of a church portals, on the underside of the arches above the tympanum, bracketing the lintel and ending on the jamb columns, each archway usually has several layered archivolts. While this basic structure and placement of archivolts is usually present, the specific artistic features of archivolts change frequently as a result of when and where they were designed and what kind of church they are a feature of. The shape of the arch is an example of this, in Gothic portals a pointed archway is iconic, while in Romanesque portals a rounded archway is to be expected. These rounded and pointed features are also seen inside the church, where Gothic churches have pointed vaults, and Romanesque churches have rounded ones.

==Evolution of archivolts==
Archivolts first became a feature on the entrance of churches in France and Spain during the Reconquest. They are believed to have evolved as a compressed version of the nave of a church, the moldings of the layered arches depicting a theological journey from outside the church to the sacred atmosphere inside it.

The use of stone sculpture on the outside of churches was first widely seen in the eleventh century. The later utilisation of these mouldings and sculptures is depicted by Calvin Kendall, “[Church Portals] concerned themselves with the spiritual well-being of worshippers, and they served to create and delineate sacred space.” The use of portals and the mouldings on their archivolts as a separation between the outside public domain and the holy space inside a church was an innovative idea to communicate knowledge about the church and theology observed inside. 

As demonstrated by Rudolph Conrad, this evolution in the utilisation of church architecture came about simultaneously with the significant advances of categorising, maintaining and sharing large amounts of information that was happening in the twelfth century. The application of this in the design of archivolts is shown through the complex theological stories and messages that are represented by the detailed design of many archivolts.

==Historical context==
===Romanesque===

The complexity of church portals and the subsequent significance of their mouldings and the designs of their archivolts was first observed on a wide scale on Romanesque churches, seen primarily in the eleventh century through to the early thirteenth century. The Romanesque period of church architecture is when stone sculpture began to become a common feature of church portals, specifically the use of Christ, on the archivolts and surrounds to signify the beginning of holy space. Romanesque portals and archivolts are most often rounded, as seen in Roman architecture. This was significant to the role of the church as both a building and congregational place as during the medieval Romanesque period most people were not able read, so these sculptures were able to depict important events central to the Christian faith and convey ideologies of the church that the public may have otherwise been unable to understand.

===Gothic===

Gothic architecture, predominately found between in mid-twelfth century and the sixteenth century was the successor to Romanesque architecture, and is often viewed as the birth of Christian architecture. This is seen in the symbolism of both the artistic and architectural features of Gothic portals and their archivolts. The classic pointed arch of Gothic portals and archivolts is used to direct people’s eyes above, to heaven, a constant reminder of the presence of God and an encouragement to focus on the sacred and heavenly aspects of life, and not the earthly ones.

==Notable examples==
===Saint-Denis Cathedral===
The Saint-Denis Cathedral is a French cathedral, known as one of the founding examples of Gothic Christian architecture, it was designed by Abbott Suger in the twelfth century and constructed during the thirteenth century. While it is generally accepted that the portals on the west facing side of Saint-Denis cathedral have most of the Early Gothic architectural features, as claimed by Pamela Blum, there is still some debate about whether the cathedral is more accurately characterised as Gothic or Romanesque due to the multiple restorations that have been done on the Cathedral in varying artistic and architectural styles since it was built.

The west-side of the cathedral is home to three church portals, all of which contain archivolts. In 1140 these three portals and the west-end of Saint-Denis Cathedral were consecrated. The archivolts of the Saint-Denis Cathedral are one of the earliest examples of the use of complex sculptures and inscriptions on church entrances as a means of communication in Gothic churches. As the archivolts of Saint-Denis Cathedral were designed in the very early stages of Gothic architecture, there are still instances of features that characterise Romanesque architecture such as the use of drapery in the sculptures of the portal.

===The Sainte-Anne Portal, Notre Dame===
Sainte-Anne portal situated on the west facade of the Notre Dame was built in Paris during the twelfth century in honour of Sainte-Anne, Mary’s Mother and Jesus Christ’s Grandmother. The portal displays some of the different aspects of Jesus Christ’s life, like his Grandparents Anne (whom the portal is dedicated to) and Joachim, and his parents Mary and Joseph. The archivolts of the Saint-Anne portal are pointed, a classic feature of Gothic archways. The archivolts are lined with several small sculptures of people, these sculptures have been identified as coming from both the twelfth and thirteenth century. Several restorations have been performed on the Saint-Anne archivolts, which was discovered as a result of the slightly varying stylistic features of the archivolts and colour differences in the stone the archivolt is made of. These sculptures on the portal and its archivolts depict specific people that were significant to the church and the community it served, both as religious icons, and figures of societal power at the time of its design, such as King Louis VIII, bishops involved with the church, Jesus and several members of his family.
===Vézelay Abbey===
The Vézelay Abbey was built in France in the ninth century on a hill in the village of Vézelay by Benedictine Monks and became a UNESCO world heritage site in 1979. This classification is due to its well preserved Burgundian Romanesque art and its importance as a religious site to Christians in the Middle Ages. The portal has a rounded arch, classic to the Romanesque style and is densely populated with many different sculptures and mouldings. The artwork on the Vézelay Abbey’s portal depicts messages and figures such as scenes from the Book of Acts, Christ, Apostles and John the Baptist. The sculptures and mouldings on the portal’s archivolts display events of the Pentecost, from the Book of Acts,

The Benedictine Monks that founded the Vézelay Abbey claimed that the remains of Mary Magdalene were found there, which made it a site of significant religious importance and consequently it became a popular site for pilgrims. The arrival of pilgrims and the subsequent increased notoriety led to vast renovations, resulting in its complex and grand artistic style. The importance of what is happening at the time of a portal’s construction, as well as its church’s intended audience is demonstrated by the design of the portal’s tympanum, which contains a large sculpture of Jesus Christ in its centre, with Magdalene depicted facing Christ at his feet. This highlights the significance of the Abbey’s purpose as a pilgrimage site to its design.

<text>In computer science and quantum physics, the Church–Turing–Deutsch principle (CTD principle) is a stronger, physical form of the Church–Turing thesis formulated by David Deutsch in 1985. The principle states that a universal computing device can simulate every physical process.

==History==
The principle was stated by Deutsch in 1985 with respect to finitary machines and processes. He observed that classical physics, which makes use of the concept of real numbers, cannot be simulated by a Turing machine, which can only represent computable reals. Deutsch proposed that quantum computers may actually obey the CTD principle, assuming that the laws of quantum physics can completely describe every physical process.

An earlier version of this thesis for classical computers was stated by Alan Turing&#x27;s friend and student Robin Gandy in 1980.

A similar thesis was stated by Michael Freedman in an early review of topological quantum computing with Alexei Kitaev, Michael J. Larsen, and Zhenghan Wang, known as the Freedman-Church-Turing thesis:

This thesis differs from the Church-Turing-Deutsch thesis insofar as it is a statement about computational complexity, and not computability.

<doc id="714076" wikidata="Q1755565" url="?curid=714076" title="Gymnure">
<text>Gymnures, also called hairy hedgehogs or moonrats, are mammals belonging to the subfamily Galericinae, in the family Erinaceidae and the order Eulipotyphla. Gymnures resemble rats but are not closely related as they are not rodents; they are instead closely related to hedgehogs, which also belong to Erinaceidae. They are thought to have appeared in Eastern Asia before their closest relatives, and changed little from the original ancestor, which is thought to have been also the ancestor of the shrews.

==Description==
Although the gymnures are more closely related to the hedgehogs, full-grown gymnures superficially resemble large rats, shrews, and opossums.

The gymnure&#x27;s body plan is believed to resemble that of the earliest mammals, with a large, toothy head about 1/3 the length of the total body, a naked furless tail for balance and thermoregulatory purposes, and a plantigrade stance. In direct contrast to the closely related hedgehogs, gymnures are not spiny.

They also have an outstanding sense of smell, and tactile response in the snout region.

==Distribution and habitat==
Gymnures inhabit moist jungle terrain in various locales of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Sumatra, China and the Malay Peninsula.

==Behaviour==
Gymnures are primarily carnivorous. They are nocturnal or crepuscular: they come out to forage at twilight or in the night to search the forest floor, using smell to find the animals that they eat. Gymnures eat various arthropods, mice, small reptiles and amphibians, with occasional fruit and fungi.

Gymnures keep territories, and individuals are solitary except when breeding. Gymnures have a very strong scent, typically described as a rancid garlic or onion smell, which is produced by its territory-marking scent glands. Several creatures similar in form and niche, such as the opossum and solenodon, have an odor similar to the gymnure&#x27;s.

==Classification==

This subfamily has alternately been called Echinosoricinae, Galericinae, and Hylomyinae. Some researchers prefer Hylomyinae because the specific relationships of the extinct genus &quot;Galerix&quot; to living erinaceids are uncertain.
There are fifteen extant species in six genera:
*Genus &quot;Echinosorex&quot;
**&quot;Echinosorex gymnura&quot; (moonrat)
*Genus &quot;Hylomys&quot;
**&quot;Hylomys parvus&quot; (dwarf gymnure)
**&quot;Hylomys suillus&quot; (Javan short-tailed gymnure or lesser moonrat)
**&quot;Hylomys dorsalis&quot; (Bornean short-tailed gymnure)
**&quot;Hylomys maxi&quot; (Max&#x27;s short-tailed gymnure)
**&quot;Hylomys macarong&quot; (Dalat gymnure)
**&quot;Hylomys peguensis&quot; (Northern short-tailed gymnure)
**&quot;Hylomys vorax&quot; (Leuser gymnure)
*Genus &quot;Neohylomys&quot;
**&quot;Neohylomys hainanensis&quot; (Hainan gymnure or Hainan moonrat)
*Genus &quot;Neotetracus&quot;
**&quot;Neotetracus sinensis&quot; (shrew gymnure)
*Genus &quot;Otohylomys&quot;
**&quot;Otohylomys megalotis&quot; (Long-eared gymnure)
*Genus &quot;Podogymnura&quot;
**&quot;Podogymnura aureospinula&quot; (Dinagat gymnure or Dinagat moonrat)
**&quot;Podogymnura intermedia&quot; (Eastern Mindanao gymnure )
**&quot;Podogymnura minima&quot;
**&quot;Podogymnura truei&quot; (Mindanao gymnure or Mindanao moonrat)

<doc id="714079" wikidata="Q2067324" url="?curid=714079" title="List of birds of Spain">
<text>This is a list of the bird species recorded in Spain. The area covered by this list is mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, and three small Spanish enclaves on the North African shore. The avifauna of Spain included a total of 664 species recorded in the wild by 2022 according to Sociedad Española de Ornitología (SEO/BirdLife) with supplemental additions from Avibase. 24 have been introduced by humans, six of which also have possibly wild-origin records. Three species have not been recorded since 1950, 8 are endemic to Spanish islands, and one of the endemic species is extinct.

This list&#x27;s taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (English and scientific names) are those of &quot;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&quot;, 2022 edition. The Spanish names in parentheses are from the SEO/BirdLife list.

The following tags have been used to highlight some categories of occurrence.
*(A) Accidental – a species that rarely or accidentally occurs anywhere in Spain
*(A) Accidental in limited area – a species found regularly in mainland Spain but accidentally in the Canary Islands or the North African enclaves.
*(E) Endemic – a species found only in Spain, with the location appended
*(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Spain although populations exist elsewhere
*(I) Introduced – a species introduced to Spain as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions and that has an established population
*(B) Category B - species which have not been recorded in Spain since 1950
*(D) Category D – species for which there are reasonable doubts as to their wild origin
*(I/D) species with individuals of possible wild origin in addition to the introduced population

An additional note such as (Canary Islands only) means that the species has been recorded solely in that locality. Species without a note of that type have been recorded at a minimum in mainland Spain. The notes of population status such as &quot;endangered&quot; apply to the world population and are from &quot;Bird Checklists of the World&quot;.

*Snowy sheathbill (), &quot;Chionis albus&quot; (A)

==Thick-knees==
Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Burhinidae

The thick-knees are a group of largely tropical waders in the family Burhinidae. They are found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats.

<text>At the 1906 Summer Olympics in Athens (often referred to as the &quot;Intercalated Games&quot;), an unofficial football event was held. Only four teams competed, with three of them being clubs from Greece and the Ottoman Empire. Medal tables list the gold medalist as Denmark, with the silver medals given to a mixed team from Smyrna, and the bronze medalists from Thessaloniki listed as Greece. Both were cities in the Ottoman Empire at the time.

Denmark were awarded the gold medal after the Athens team failed to appear for the second half of the final. The Athens team were subsequently invited to play off in a three-team tournament to decide second place, but refused and were promptly ejected from the competition, leaving Smyrna and Thessaloniki to play off for the silver and bronze medals.

The Thessaloniki team composition was Greek from the group of &quot;Friends of the Arts&quot; (&quot;Omilos Philomuson&quot;, later Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.). The Smyrna (former name of Turkish city İzmir), a team consisted of English, French and Armenian players, was also part of the competition. The Danish team was a selection of players from the Copenhagen Football Association. As this competition was not an official Olympic football tournament, no national football teams participated.

All the matches were played at Podilatodromio, which was originally a velodrome.

== Venue ==

All the matches were hosted at &quot;Neo Phaliron Velodrome&quot; (or &quot;Podilatodromio&quot;), originally a velodrome and sports arena in the Neo Faliro District of Piraeus. This venue had been used for the track cycling events at the Athens 1896 Olympics also held in Athens.

This venue was then demolished to build the Karaiskakis Stadium, a football stadium with capacity for 32,000.

<doc id="714104" wikidata="Q2378134" url="?curid=714104" title="An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture">
<text>An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture is a dissertation by the English mathematician and scholar Isaac Newton. This was sent in a letter to John Locke on 14 November 1690. In fact, Newton may have been in dialogue with Locke about this issue much earlier. While living in France, Locke made a journal entry, dated 20 December 1679, where he indicates that while visiting the library at Saint-Germain-des-Prés he saw:

Newton&#x27;s work also built upon the textual work of Richard Simon and his own research. The text was first published in English in 1754, 27 years after his death. The account claimed to review the textual evidence available from ancient sources on two disputed Bible passages: 1 John 5:7 and 1 Timothy 3:16.

Newton describes this letter as &quot;an account of what the reading has been in all ages, and what steps it has been changed, as far as I can hitherto determine by records&quot;, and &quot;a criticism concerning a text of Scripture&quot;. He blames &quot;the Roman church&quot; for many abuses in the world and accuses it of &quot;pious frauds&quot;. He adds that &quot;the more learned and quick-sighted men, as Luther, Erasmus, Bullinger, Grotius, and some others, would not dissemble their knowledge&quot;.

Newton&#x27;s work on this issue was part of a larger effort of scholars studying the Bible and finding that, for example, the Trinity is not found in the original manuscripts and is not explicitly expressed. Such scholarship was suppressed, and Newton kept his discoveries private.

==1 John 5:7==
In the King James Version of the New Testament, 1 John 5:7 reads:

Using the writings of the early Church Fathers, the Greek and Latin manuscripts and the testimony of the earliest extant manuscripts of the Bible, Newton demonstrated that the words &quot;in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one&quot;, that support the Trinity doctrine, did not appear in the original Greek Scriptures. He then demonstrates that the words crept into the Latin versions, first as a marginal note, and later into the text itself. He noted that &quot;the Æthiopic, Syriac, Greek, Armenian, Georgian and Slavonic versions, still in use in the several Eastern nations, Ethiopia, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Eastern European Armenia, Georgia, Muscovy, and some others, are strangers to this reading&quot;. He argued that it was first taken into a Greek text in 1515 by Cardinal Ximenes. Finally, Newton considered the sense and context of the verse, concluding that removing the interpolation makes &quot;the sense plain and natural, and the argument full and strong; but if you insert the testimony of &#x27;the Three in Heaven&#x27; you interrupt and spoil it.&quot; Today most versions of the Bible are from the Critical Text and omit this verse, or retain it as only a marginal reading. However, some reject Newton’s conclusion and argue that the verse is not a later corruption.

==1 Timothy 3:16==

The shorter portion of Newton&#x27;s dissertation was concerned with 1 Timothy 3:16, which reads (in the King James Version):

Newton argued that, by a small alteration in the Greek text, the word &quot;God&quot; was substituted to make the phrase read &quot;God was manifest in the flesh&quot; instead of &quot;which was manifested in the flesh&quot;. He attempted to demonstrate that early Church writers in referring to the verse knew nothing of such an alteration. This change increases textual support for trinitarianism, a doctrine to which Newton did not subscribe. There is evidence that the original Greek read but was modified by the addition of a strikethrough to become (see the excerpt from the Codex Sinaiticus, above). was then assumed to be a contraction of . The biblical scholar Metzger explains, &quot;no uncial (in the first hand) earlier than the eighth or ninth century[...] supports ; all ancient versions presuppose or ; and no patristic writer prior to the last third of the fourth century testifies to the reading of .&quot; In other words, Bible manuscripts closest to the said &#x27;who&#x27; and not &#x27;God&#x27; in verse 16.

==Summary of both passages==
Newton concludes: &quot;If the ancient churches in debating and deciding the greatest mysteries of religion, knew nothing of these two texts, I understand not, why we should be so fond of them now the debates are over.&quot; With minor exceptions, it was only in the nineteenth century that Bible translations appeared changing these passages. Modern versions of the Bible from the Critical Text usually omit the addition to 1 John 5:7, but some place it in a footnote, with a comment indicating that &quot;it is not found in the earliest manuscripts&quot;. Modern translations of 1 Timothy 3:16 following the Critical Text now typically replace &quot;God&quot; with &quot;He&quot; or &quot;He who&quot;, while the literal Emphasized has &quot;who&quot;.

A number of papers in the years following responded to Newton, notably John Berriman in 1741, who had seen at least some of Newton&#x27;s text prior to publication. Later, Frederick Nolan in 1815, Ebenezer Henderson in 1830 and John William Burgon in the Revision Revised in 1883 all contributed substantially to the verse discussion.

==Historical background==
Newton did not publish these findings during his lifetime, likely due to the political climate. Those who wrote against the doctrine of the Trinity were subject to persecution in England. The Blasphemy Act 1697 made it an offence to deny one of the persons of the Trinity to be God, punishable with loss of office and employment on the first occasion, further legal ramifications on the second occasion, and imprisonment without hope for bail on the third occasion. Newton&#x27;s friend William Whiston (translator of the works of Josephus) lost his professorship at Cambridge for this reason in 1711. In 1693 a pamphlet attacking the Trinity was burned by order of the House of Lords, and the next year its printer and author were prosecuted.

The dissertation was published in 1754.

<doc id="714118" wikidata="Q1931304" url="?curid=714118" title="To Hell with the Devil">
<text>To Hell with the Devil is the third studio album by the Christian metal band Stryper, released in 1986. It was the first Christian metal album to achieve platinum status, selling over one million copies. It remained the best-selling Christian metal album until P.O.D.&#x27;s &quot;Satellite&quot; in 2001.

The album was listed at No. 88 in the 2001 book, &quot;CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music&quot;. The album was the only heavy metal album on the list. Ian Christe, author of the heavy metal history book &quot;Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal&quot; (2003), mentions &quot;To Hell with the Devil&quot; in his book as one of the landmarks of the glam metal movement.
Throughout 1987, both music videos for &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Honestly&quot; ranked No. 1 on &quot;Dial MTV&quot;, the daily MTV list of most requested videos. The first single/video video for &quot;Calling on You&quot; also reached No. 2 on the show. &quot;Honestly&quot; was the biggest single from the record peaking at #23 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 Singles Chart.

The original artwork depicted four long haired angels (closely resembling the band members) throwing the devil into a fiery pit. The cover was then changed on later pressings to a basic black cover with the Stryper logo and the album title in the center.

According to Michael Sweet&#x27;s autobiography, as the band started to record the album, Michael felt Tim Gaines wasn&#x27;t the right bassist for the record. He was replaced by bassist Matt Hurich, who eventually ended up not working out. So session bassist Brad Cobb took Gaines&#x27; place while recording the album. However, before the tour began, Sweet asked Gaines to rejoin as he felt it wasn&#x27;t right performing as &quot;Stryper&quot; without him.

In 2010, &quot;HM Magazine&quot; listed &quot;To Hell with the Devil&quot; No. 3 on its Top 100 Christian Rock Albums of All Time list stating that &quot;when this album broke, it went multi-platinum, forever raising the ceiling of what heavy Christian music could do.&quot; Heaven&#x27;s Metal fanzine ranked it No. 6 on its Top 100 Christian metal albums of all-time list.

<text>Hrvatska radiotelevizija ( HRT), or Croatian Radiotelevision, is a Croatian public broadcasting company. It operates several radio and television channels, over a domestic transmitter network as well as satellite. HRT is divided into three joint companies – Croatian Radio (), Croatian Television () and Music Production (), which includes three orchestras (Symphony, Jazz, and Tamburitza) and a choir.

The founder of HRT is the Republic of Croatia which exercises its founder&#x27;s rights through the Croatian Government. Croatian Radio (then Radio Zagreb) was founded on 15 May 1926. This date is considered the date on which HRT was founded. Television Zagreb (today Croatian Television) began broadcasting on 7 September 1956. By the law enacted by the Croatian Parliament on 29 June 1990, Radio Television Zagreb was renamed to Croatian Radiotelevision.

HRT operates as a provider of public broadcasting services, and Croatia provides independent funding by the Croatian Broadcasting Company Law and the State Aid Rules for Public Broadcasting Services. In carrying out its activities, HRT is independent of any political influence and commercial interest.

On 25 May 2012, HRT&#x27;s archive of the television and radio program and its collection of musical production was given the status of Croatian cultural heritage.

==History==
Croatian Radiotelevision is the direct successor of Radio Station Zagreb () that started broadcasting on 15 May 1926, the first radio station to broadcast in the Balkans. The station was initially a private company, before Radio Zagreb was nationalized on 1 May 1940. During the Independent State of Croatia, the station was known as &quot;Hrvatski krugoval&quot;. After World War II, it began to operate as a state-owned radio station.

At the end of the first year of operation, Radio Zagreb company had a little over four thousand subscribers.

On the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Zagreb Radio Station, on 15 May 1956, the first television programme was broadcast from the transmitter built at Sljeme. Television Zagreb&#x27;s first live broadcast aired on 7 September 1956, making Croatia the first Yugoslav republic to have television. For the next two years this was the only television broadcasting service in the southeast European area. Colour television broadcasts began in 1972. In 1970s, Radio Zagreb Correspondence Center and to a lesser extent Zagreb TV were the main coordinators of cooperation with other units of the Yugoslav Radio Television in production of media content for numerous Yugoslav citizens abroad. The program was aired by Radio Cologne, Frankfurt, Free Berlin, Zurich, Vienna, Paris, Liege, Luxembourg, Hilversum and Stockholm while the second program of the German public television aired Zagreb made &quot;Good Morning Yugoslavia&quot; show.

In May 1990, following Franjo Tuđman&#x27;s election victory, he and his ruling Croatian Democratic Union party began a takeover of radio and television stations. In June 1990, the Croatian Parliament renamed the company from Radio Television Zagreb () to Croatian Radiotelevision (). The HDZ-majority Croatian Parliament soon appointed party loyalists to top managerial and editorial positions on the broadcaster. 

The film director Antun Vrdoljak, a Tuđman appointee who was tasked with overseeing the changes, pledged to make HRT into the &quot;cathedral of the Croatian spirit&quot;. On 16 September 1991, 300 employees at HRT were fired for &quot;security reasons&quot;. According to Miljenko Jergović, formerly of the Croatian independent &quot;Feral Tribune&quot;, there were three waves of purges at HRT at this time: removal of Serb journalists; removal of &quot;independent-minded, respected and thus dangerous&quot; journalists; and slowly, the removal of those who did not support ultranationalism any longer.

On 1 January 1993, HRT was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

The television channels were aired under the name Croatian Television () between 1990 and 1993. Since then, the current name has been used. The radio broadcast unit is referred to as Croatian Radio ().

Following Tuđman&#x27;s death and the 2000 election in Croatia which brought Stjepan Mesić to power, attempts at reforming HRT into a more open media were made.

== Funding ==
In 2014, more than 85% of HRT&#x27;s revenue came from broadcast user fees with each household in Croatia required to pay 79 HRK (~€10) per month for a single television set, with the remainder being made up from limited advertising.

== Editorial independence ==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated HRT to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

<doc id="714125" wikidata="Q283100" url="?curid=714125" title="Patrik Eliáš">
<text>Patrik Eliáš (; born 13 April 1976) is a Czech former professional hockey winger who played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the New Jersey Devils. Eliáš is the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in points, goals and assists, and he holds the franchise record for most career game-winning goals (80). Eliáš won the Stanley Cup twice with the Devils, in 2000 and 2003. He also ranks second in points by a Czech-born player in the NHL behind Jaromír Jágr. Internationally Eliáš represented the Czech national team in multiple tournaments, including four Winter Olympics and four World Championships, winning one Olympic bronze medal and two more at the World Championships. He is a member of the Czech Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
Eliáš was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the second round, 51st overall, in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft.

Along with Petr Sýkora and Jason Arnott (who together formed the Devils&#x27; famous &quot;A-Line&quot;), he helped lead the team to a Stanley Cup in the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs. He scored twice against the Philadelphia Flyers in the deciding Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, and also assisted on Arnott&#x27;s Stanley Cup-clinching goal in double overtime in Game 6 away against the Dallas Stars. The following year, he scored a team-record 96 points in the regular season, third-best in the NHL. Two years later, he played a key role in New Jersey&#x27;s 2003 Stanley Cup victory after recording seven points (three goals and four assists) in the finals series against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Eliáš played hockey in the Russian Superleague (RSL) for Metallurg Magnitogorsk.
Three months into the 2005–06 season, Eliáš made his first appearance of the season on 3 January 2006, against the Florida Panthers, after missing 39 games due to Hepatitis A, resuming his role as an alternate captain (replacing Alexander Mogilny). He scored eight points in his first four games to help the Devils win his first nine games back with the team. In the first game of the 2006 playoffs, against the New York Rangers, he became the tenth player to score six points in one NHL playoff game, with two goals and four assists. Eliáš&#x27; 2006 playoff campaign was spectacular, despite the fact that the Devils were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champions Carolina Hurricanes in the second round. Eliáš recorded 6 goals and 10 assists for an impressive 16 points in just 9 games.

Unable to reach a contract with the Devils entering the 2006 off-season, Eliáš tested unrestricted free agency. In addition to offers from the Chicago Blackhawks and the Montreal Canadiens, Eliáš verbally agreed to sign with the rival New York Rangers on 1 July. However, negotiations stalled when Rangers general manager Glen Sather would not agree on a no-movement clause in his contract. Eliáš subsequently called Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello and the two sides agreed on a seven-year, $42 million contract that included a no-movement clause.

Eliáš was named the Devils&#x27; new captain on 5 October 2006, becoming the seventh captain in the team&#x27;s history. The previous captain of the Devils was defenseman Scott Stevens, now retired. Eliáš became the first European-born captain in the history of the franchise. However, at the start of the 2007–08 season, Eliáš was stripped of the captaincy by incoming head coach Brent Sutter. The Devils named Jamie Langenbrunner his replacement as captain on 5 December 2007.

Sutter later placed Eliáš on a top scoring line which consisted of Dainus Zubrus and Brian Gionta. Eliáš was also known to work well with Devils winger Zach Parise, with whom he occasionally played with on &quot;Heroes Line&quot; and frequently played with on the power-play unit.

On 17 March 2009, Eliáš became the Devils&#x27; all-time leading scorer by recording his 702nd career NHL regular season point, an assist on Brian Gionta&#x27;s shorthanded goal. Gionta&#x27;s goal was the game-winner in a 3–2 win over the visiting Chicago Blackhawks, providing the difference in goaltender Martin Brodeur&#x27;s record-breaking 552nd win to surpass Patrick Roy, who held the former record at 551 wins. Chants of &quot;Pa-trik E-li-as&quot; were heard as Devils&#x27; PA announcer Kevin Clark confirmed to the crowd that Eliáš had broken John MacLean&#x27;s record. Eliáš was named the second star of the night, behind only Brodeur.

Eliáš was the winner of the 2009 Golden Hockey Stick as the world&#x27;s best Czech hockey player, ending Jaromír Jágr&#x27;s four-year streak. He scored his 300th career goal on 12 December 2009, against the Philadelphia Flyers.
Despite a weak first half by the Devils during the 2010–11 season, Eliáš was selected to be the Devils sole representative at the 2011 NHL All-Star Game in Raleigh, North Carolina. This was his third All-Star appearance and he was eventually selected by Team Staal in the first-ever NHL All-Star &quot;fantasy draft&quot;. On 19 February 2011, Eliáš recorded the 800th NHL point of his career with his third assist of the game against the Carolina Hurricanes. At the conclusion of the season, on 1 April, Eliáš scored his eighth career hat trick, coming against the Philadelphia Flyers.

In the following 2011–12 season, Eliáš scored two goals (347, 348) against the Montreal Canadiens on 17 December 2011 to tie (then surpass) John MacLean as the Devils&#x27; leading goalscorer. Eliáš played his 1,000th career NHL game on 6 January 2012, against the Florida Panthers. In the game, he scored a goal and recorded two assists in a 5–2 victory.

On 27 January 2013, against the Montreal Canadiens, Eliáš recorded his 900th career NHL point with one goal and two assists. On 6 January 2015, in a 4–1 victory against the Buffalo Sabres, he became the 82nd player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points; he recorded one goal and two assists in the game. One month later, on 6 February in the Devils&#x27; 4–1 home win over the Toronto Maple Leafs, Eliáš scored his 400th NHL goal, becoming the 91st player in NHL history to do so.

On 31 March 2017, Eliáš announced his retirement from professional ice hockey.

On 3 August 2017, the Devils announced that his no. 26 would be retired on 24 February 2018, prior to a game against the New York Islanders, the team against whom Eliáš played the most games in his career (91) and scored the most points against (86) over his career. Eliáš became the first forward to have his number retired by the Devils and the fifth Devil overall.

==International play==
Eliáš played his first game in the national squad in 1998, and has played 40 times for the national team, scoring 20 goals (as of end of season 2010/2011). He was selected as captain of the Czech squad for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

==Personal life==
Eliáš married Petra Volakova, also a native Czech, in the 2007 off-season. Together they have two daughters. On 11 January 2018, Eliáš became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

<text>Green sauce or greensauce is a family of cold, uncooked sauces based on chopped herbs, including the Spanish and Italian &quot;salsa verde&quot;, the French , the German or (Frankfurt dialect), the British mint sauce and greensauce, and the Argentinian &quot;chimichurri&quot;.

The Mexican &quot;salsa verde&quot;, though also called a &quot;green sauce&quot;, is instead based on tomatillos and is commonly cooked; the New Mexico version uses a green chile base.

==History==
Green sauce has a long history in many parts of Europe. It was certainly present in the Middle Ages, and may date to the Classical period.

Green sauce made with parsley and often sage was one of the most common sauces of medieval cookery. In a 14th-century recipe, green sauce served with a dish of cheese and whole egg yolks boiled in watered down wine with herbs and spices was recommended for &quot;lords, for settling their temperament and whetting their appetite&quot;.

The basic recipe is probably from the Near East and, as such, is probably at least 2,000 years old. Roman legionaries brought it to Italy, from where it was exported to France and Germany. Evidence suggests that it was introduced in Frankfurt by the Italian trading families Bolongaro and Crevenna around 1700.

A possible origin of the German variant are French Protestant immigrants emigrating to Kurhessen in the 18th century. The German variant uses a different mix of herbs, since Mediterranean herbs were not available in Germany at the time.

==Ancient Rome==
The &quot;Apicius&quot; (5th century CE) mentions a &quot;Ius viride in avibus&quot; (&#x27;Green sauce for fowl&#x27;) consisting of pepper, caraway, spikenard, cumin, bay leaves, a variety of green herbs, dates, honey, vinegar, wine, broth, and oil.

==Spain==
In Spain, &quot;salsa verde&quot; usually refers to a fish sauce. The sauce is prepared using a base made of garlic and onion sofrito. A flour-coated piece of fish (typically hake, clams) is added to it. Once the flour coating has cooked, white wine and fish fumet is added, letting the fish be boiled. As the fish is cooked through, the sauce thickens. In the final steps, parsley is added, giving the sauce its characteristic green colour. &quot;Merluza en salsa verde&quot; (hake in green sauce) is perhaps the most typical dish prepared in this way. Depending on the fish and on the region, other green herbs may be employed as well, including spinach, fresh savory, watercress, or tarragon.

==Italy==

The Italian is a cold rustic sauce, and includes parsley, vinegar, capers, garlic, onion, anchovies, olive oil, and possibly mustard. The ingredients are coarsely chopped, formerly by hand, now often in a food processor. In some regions, cubed bread is soaked in vinegar and blended with the other ingredients, which creates an emulsion somewhat similar to a vinaigrette. In other regions, there is no bread.

 is used as a condiment or dipping sauce for meats, fish, poultry, or vegetables. , known in Piedmont and Lombardy as , is served with in a &quot;classic meat dish&quot;, served in many city and country restaurants. The salted lake sardines from the Lake Como, called , are warmed or grilled and served with . It is also served with other grilled or stewed fish. A with garlic, called , is a traditional specialty of the Siena region on the feast day of Saint John.

 is a green sauce in Milanese cuisine based on parsley, lemon peel, and garlic, and is the usual accompaniment for ossobuco.

==France==
The French persillade is a simple sauce, based on chopped parsley and garlic, and possibly shallots, olive oil, vinegar and/or breadcrumbs. Another recipe, named , was already known in the Renaissance, and was originally a bread sauce very similar to the Italian; today the is usually mayonnaise flavoured with tarragon, and sometimes parsley, sage and remon juice or vinegar.

==Germany==

 is a specialty of the German state of Hesse. Centres of popularity are the cities of Frankfurt am Main (where it is sometimes called ) and Kassel, which lay claim to its origins. The Frankfurt-style is made exclusively from seven fresh herbs, namely parsley, chives, chervil, borage, sorrel, garden cress, and salad burnet together with sour cream, oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and added hard boiled eggs. Variants of other local areas, often varying by season, include dill, shallots, lovage, lemon balm, and even spinach. In more frugal times, daisy leaves, broad plantain leaves, and dandelion leaves have been used.

The hard-boiled eggs are sieved or pureed before being mixed with sour cream to form the creamy base of the sauce. The fresh chopped herbs are then added. Some variations use buttermilk, quark, or yogurt instead of sour cream. In the city of Kassel, a combination of sour cream and is used.

The sauce is served cold with peeled boiled potatoes or just with rye bread, as an accompaniment to either hard-boiled eggs or roast beef brisket. It may also be served with cooked fish or roast beef, or as a side dish to barbecue. A local schnitzel specialty, called Frankfurter Schnitzel, is always served with green sauce, along with apple cider () as a traditional accompanying drink. Green sauce was supposedly Goethe&#x27;s favourite condiment; a legend that his mother invented it is likely apocryphal.

The local importance of the dish is shown by the abundance of green sauce at local markets and by the Green Sauce Monument installed in Frankfurt-Oberrad in 2007. The latter consists of seven small greenhouses with the main herbal ingredients and was part of the Luminale, a local art and light event. The protected geographical indication (PGI) was awarded to the fresh herb composition by the European Union on 9 March 2016; publication of the detailed application with the product specification dated October 2015.

In many Hessian families, Green Sauce is part of the traditional meal eaten on Maundy Thursday, relating to its German name Gründonnerstag ().

==Britain==
British greensauce is made of herbs, especially sorrel, mixed with vinegar and sugar. It is eaten with meat. It is first documented in the 12th century in the writings of Alexander Neckham. His recipe includes sage, parsley, dittany, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper, and a spice which is little-known nowadays, costus. Sorrel was so heavily used in greensauce that sorrel itself was sometimes called &quot;greensauce&quot;.

==Argentina==

Chimichurri is a green sauce used in Argentina and other parts of Latin America, usually served on grilled meat.

<text>Kenneth Michael Pollack (born 1966) is an American former CIA intelligence analyst and expert on Middle East politics and military affairs. He has served on the National Security Council staff and has written several articles and books on international relations. Currently, he is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, &quot;where he works on Middle Eastern political-military affairs, focusing in particular on Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries. Before that he was Senior Fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and a senior advisor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.

==Early life and education==
Born to a Jewish family, Pollack obtained a BA from Yale University, in 1988, and went on to earn a PhD from MIT, under supervision of Barry Posen, in 1996.

==Personal life==
Pollack is married to Andrea Koppel, the daughter of the well-known broadcast journalist Ted Koppel.

==Career==
He has served in a variety of roles in government. From 1988 until 1995, he was an analyst on Iraqi and Iranian military issues for the Central Intelligence Agency. He spent a year as Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs with the United States National Security Council. In 1999, he rejoined the NSC as the Director for Persian Gulf Affairs. He also served two stints as a professor with the National Defense University.

Outside of government, he worked for the Brookings Institution as the director of research at its Saban Center for Middle East Policy. He previously worked for the Council of Foreign Relations as their director of national security studies. He has also written seven books, the first two of which were published in 2002. His first monograph, &quot;Arabs at War&quot;, examined the foreign policy of six Arab nations in the years between World War II and the Persian Gulf War.

===Advocacy of Iraq invasion===
In his second book, &quot;The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq&quot; (pub. 2002), Pollack details the history of United States actions against Iraq since the Persian Gulf War of 1991. He says that the United States should invade Iraq, and describes ways of going about it. Pollack argued that Saddam Hussein was simply too volatile and aggressive in his policies to be trusted not to begin another conflict in a volatile region. In &quot;The Threatening Storm&quot;, Pollack argued &quot;the only prudent and realistic course of action left to the United States is to mount a full-scale invasion of Iraq to smash the Iraqi armed forces, depose Saddam&#x27;s regime, and rid the country of weapons of mass destruction.&quot; Pollack predicted, &quot;It is unimaginable that the United States would have to contribute hundreds of billions of dollars and highly unlikely that we would have to contribute even tens of billions of dollars.&quot; Likewise, he wrote, &quot;we should not exaggerate the danger of casualties among American troops. U.S. forces in Bosnia have not suffered a single casualty from hostile action because they have become so attentive and skillful at force protection.&quot;

Pollack is credited with persuading liberals of the case for the Iraq war. New York Times columnist Bill Keller, in supporting the Iraq war in 2003, wrote &quot;Kenneth Pollack, the Clinton National Security Council expert whose argument for invading Iraq is surely the most influential book of this season, has provided intellectual cover for every liberal who finds himself inclining toward war but uneasy about Mr. Bush.&quot; Liberal writer Matthew Yglesias in the &quot;LA Times&quot; also attested to Pollack&#x27;s influence:

Of course, those of us who read Pollack&#x27;s celebrated 2002 book, &quot;The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq,&quot; and became convinced as a result that the United States needed to, well, invade Iraq in order to dismantle Saddam Hussein&#x27;s advanced nuclear weapons program (the one he didn&#x27;t actually have) might feel a little too bitter to once again defer to our betters.

Many have criticized his support for the Invasion of Iraq, including Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk, who called &quot;The Threatening Storm&quot; the &quot;most meretricious contribution&quot; to the pre-war &quot;debate&quot; on military action and included it in the select bibliography section of his 2005 book &quot;The Great War for Civilisation&quot; in order to &quot;show just how specific – and misleading – were the efforts to persuade Americans to invade.&quot;

Many critics, as well as many of those who used the book to justify their support of the invasion, overlooked the more balanced presentation on the pros and cons of war to be found in &quot;The Threatening Storm&quot;. As Chris Suellentrop of Slate pointed out before the invasion on March 5, 2003:

Six months after The Threatening Storm&#x27;s publication, however, Pollack&#x27;s book reads as much like an indictment of the Bush administration&#x27;s overeagerness to go to war as it does an endorsement of it. A more appropriate subtitle for the book would have been The Case for Rebuilding Afghanistan, Destroying al-Qaida, Setting Israel and Palestine on the Road to Peace, and Then, a Year or Two Down the Road After Some Diplomacy, Invading Iraq. In interviews and op-ed articles, Pollack himself still supports the war, saying that now is better than never. But it&#x27;s fair to say that his book does not—or at least not Bush&#x27;s path to it.

Pollack responded to the Suellentrop article by saying that he was unhappy that many people seemed to have read only the subtitle of his book, which had not been his choice. He also said:

given how far down the road the Bush Administration has taken us, I think that we have no realistic choice but to go to war this year. And yet I think the Administration has handled the diplomacy and public diplomacy of coalition building very poorly, and I am deeply concerned about the impact this will have both on postwar reconstruction and on our ability to garner allies for the inevitable next crisis.

Pollack later was a strong supporter of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 advocated by General David Petraeus, which entailed a buildup of US ground forces to improve the security of the Iraqi population and help Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens. He laid out some of his arguments in support of the surge in the June 2007 &quot;NY Times&quot; article &quot;A War We Just Might Win,&quot; which was co-authored with Michael E. O&#x27;Hanlon of Brookings.

==Other publications==

In 2004, his third book, &quot;The Persian Puzzle&quot;, was published. In contrast to his views on Iraq, in &quot;The Persian Puzzle&quot; he argued that though the threat of force is necessary in dealing with Iran, diplomacy rather than regime change by force is the best way of dealing with Iran because Iran&#x27;s policy-makers are divided between pragmatists who are motivated by a desire to improve the economy and hardliners who fear U.S. attack and so seek a nuclear deterrent, - the United States can thus exploit this divide to negotiate a favourable agreement. He also argued that the hardliners leader, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, was, unlike Saddam Hussein, rational and risk-averse and so, even if Iran did acquire a nuclear capability, Iran could be deterred in a way that Saddam Hussein could not be.

In 2007, Pollack co-authored the book &quot;Things Fall Apart: Containing the Spillover from an Iraqi Civil War&quot; with Daniel L. Byman. This book analyzed 12 recent civil wars to derive six common ways in which fullscale ethnic civil wars &quot;spillover&quot; to affect neighboring states. Pollack and Byman argued that while spillover can range from modest effects to very severe problems (like causing other civil wars or triggering regional wars among neighboring states) that the early evidence so far suggested that the United States should be prepared for Iraq&#x27;s potential descent into all-out civil war to be on the worse end of the spectrum. The book went on to lay out thirteen different ways that the United States and its allies might fashion a &quot;containment&quot; strategy for Iraq, which offered some chance of preventing all-out civil war in Iraq from destabilizing the wider Persian Gulf region in the event that American efforts to stabilize the country failed. While Pollack and Byman argued that such a containment strategy would be very difficult to make work given the historical problems of doing so and the specific problems created by previous American actions in Iraq, they also concluded that containment would likely prove America&#x27;s least bad option because U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf were so important that Washington would have to try to mitigate the impact of spillover.

He has written numerous articles for publications such as the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. He has also repeatedly testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He currently teaches Security Problems of the Middle East / Persian Gulf and Military Analysis at Georgetown&#x27;s School of Foreign Service.

Pollack&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;A Path Out of the Desert: A Grand Strategy for America in the Middle East&quot;, was published in July 2008. In a review in &quot;Army Magazine&quot;, former commander of Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq LTG James M. Dubik, US Army Retired, described the book as providing a clear description of America&#x27;s vital interests in the Middle East and presenting well-documented, cogent arguments on the threats posed by the regional anger and frustration bred by crippling societal problems. Pollack recommends a grand strategy for the United States and its allies in which they

encourage and enable the countries of the Middle East to pursue a gradual process of political, economic and social reform—one that grows from within, rather than being imposed from without; one that reflects the values, traditions, history and aspirations of the people of the region themselves, not a Western guess at them; one that recognizes that reform and stability are not mutually exclusive but mutually reinforcing—and ultimately mutually essential.

==Allegation of espionage==

A U.S. government indictment alleged that Pollack provided information to former American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) employees Steve J. Rosen and Keith Weissman during the AIPAC espionage scandal. In April 2009, the indictment was dropped.

<text>Patty Wagstaff (née Patricia Rosalie Kearns Combs; born September 11, 1951) is an American aviator and U.S. national aerobatic champion.

Wagstaff was introduced to aviation as a child; her father was a pilot for Japan Airlines. After graduating from high school in California, she moved to Australia for five years where she traveled up the west coast of Australia in a small single-engine boat with no radio. After moving to Alaska in 1978, she worked for the Bristol Bay Native Association in Dillingham, Alaska where she started taking flying lessons and began her own career as a pilot. Her first flight in a small airplane in the Alaskan bush ended in a crash and that was when she decided to learn to fly. Her first lesson was in a Cessna 185. After earning her single and multi-engine land, single engine sea and commercial and instrument ratings, she became a Certified Flight and Instrument Instructor. Since then Wagstaff has earned a commercial rotorcraft rating and has flown many types of aircraft. She holds type ratings in the TBM Avenger, T-28, L-39 and Tucano. Her sister, Toni, is a pilot for United Airlines.

In 1985, Wagstaff qualified for the US National Aerobatic Team and competed both nationally and internationally until 1996. She was the top U.S. medal winner, winning gold, silver, and bronze medals in international competitions for several years. In 1991, she won her first of three US National Aerobatic Championships, the first woman to win that competition. She was the International Aerobatic Club champion in 1993. The following year, her Goodrich-sponsored Extra 260 airplane was put on display next to Amelia Earhart&#x27;s Lockheed Vega at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum. From 1988 to 1994, she won the Betty Skelton First Lady of Aerobatics award six times in a row. In 1996, Wagstaff was the top-scoring US pilot at the World Aerobatics Championship. That year, she was also the first person to win the Charlie Hillard Trophy, awarded to the highest scoring U.S. pilot at the World Aerobatic Championships.

In 1997, Wagstaff received her first Hall of Fame inductions, becoming inducted into both the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame and the International Women&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame. She was awarded the National Aeronautic Association Paul Tissandier Diploma in 1997 and won the Bill Barber Award for sportsmanship in 1998. In 2001, Wagstaff began training pilots of the Kenya Wildlife Service in Kenya. In 2002, she won the Katherine and Marjorie Stinson Award, and in 2004, was elected into what is arguably aviation&#x27;s most prestigious hall, the National Aviation Hall of Fame. In December 2006, she was inducted into the International Council of Air Shows Foundation Hall of Fame and in 2007, the International Air and Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air and Space Museum.

Based in St. Augustine, Florida, Patty Wagstaff Aviation Safety, LLC trains pilots from all over the world in aerobatics, airmanship and upset training. She continues working in the aviation field as an airshow pilot, stunt pilot for films, consultant, flight instructor, and writer. Wagstaff is emeritus board member of the Smithsonian Institution, National Air and Space Museum, and was on the Presidential Advisory Committee to the Centennial of Flight Commission. She flies airshows across North America in a variety of airplanes, including an Extra 300S, T-6 Texan, and a P-51 Mustang. In addition to airshows, she has flown OV-10 Broncos as a seasonal aerial firefighter director in California. She is an instrument-rated pilot and has owned a Beechcraft Baron and a Cirrus SR22 and currently flies a Beechcraft Bonanza.

Wagstaff has been featured numerous times in Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Flight Simulator&quot; series.

<text>Mozilla Mail &amp; Newsgroups (also referred to as Mozilla Mail/News or simply Mozilla Mail) was an e-mail and news client that was part of the Mozilla Application Suite.

Mozilla Mail &amp; Newsgroups featured e.g. support for relevant protocols such as IMAP, POP3 and SMTP, a built-in Bayesian spam filter, support for multiple accounts, etc. The feature set was mostly comparable with that of the stand-alone alternative, Mozilla Thunderbird. This was because the two applications shared the same codebase for most things except the user interface.

Mozilla Application Suite has been superseded by SeaMonkey and the email and news client is now SeaMonkey Mail &amp; Newsgroups. A re-packaged version of Mozilla Mail and Newsgroups was also included in Netscape versions 6 and 7, known as Netscape Mail &amp; Newsgroups, and also appears in Classilla.

<text>Prose Works other than Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, sometimes called Prose Works other than Science and Health or simply Prose Works, is a single-volume compendium of the major works of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, outside of her main work, &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot;.

<doc id="714146" wikidata="Q1689412" url="?curid=714146" title="The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour">
<text>The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour is an American trilogy of crossover television specials between the animated television series &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; and &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; and consisting of &quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour&quot;, &quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide!&quot; and &quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators!&quot;. The episodes premiered on Nickelodeon between 2004 and 2006, and were subsequently released to home video. They combine multiple types of animation, using 2D computer animation for the segments set in the &quot;Fairly OddParents&quot; universe and 3D computer animation for the &quot;Jimmy Neutron&quot; segments. In these specials, Timmy is sent to Retroville by wishing for the laboratory in the universe for his science project. But he meets Jimmy, who repairs his robot dog Goddard. They swap places accidentally, and things go wrong because Jimmy and Timmy miscommunicate with them. It&#x27;s up to them to save the universes. The events of the crossover take place during the second and third seasons of &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot; and during the fourth and fifth seasons of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;.

==Plot==
===&quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour&quot; (2004)===
Struggling with his science project, Timmy Turner wishes that he could be sent to the best laboratory in any universe. When his fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, fulfill this wish, Timmy is sent to the town of Retroville in the universe of child prodigy Jimmy Neutron. Jimmy is sent to Dimmsdale in Timmy&#x27;s universe when he accidentally activates a magical transporter created by Cosmo and Wanda. As they attempt to return to their respective worlds, Jimmy and Timmy meet the various side characters of each universe and Timmy becomes romantically involved with Jimmy&#x27;s classmate, Cindy Vortex. While messing around in Jimmy&#x27;s lab, Timmy accidentally turns Goddard, Jimmy&#x27;s robotic dog, into a giant, violent monster from a video game he was playing. Timmy manages to stop Goddard from destroying Retroville, but is contacted by Jimmy, who tells him that Mr. Crocker, Timmy&#x27;s fairy-obsessed teacher, has stolen the transporter, allowing him to take over Fairy World. Crocker is defeated by Jimmy. Both Jimmy and Timmy manage to return to their own universes. Back in Dimmsdale, Timmy realizes that he never finished his project, but at the last second, Jimmy teleports Goddard to the science fair, allowing Timmy to win.

===&quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide&quot; (2006)===
Jimmy and Timmy enter each other&#x27;s worlds for a second time, both wanting to ask Cindy out to their school dance celebrating Friday the 13th. In an attempt to gain Cindy&#x27;s affections, the two engage in a battle of smarts that sends Jimmy and his friends to Dimmsdale. As Jimmy seeks to prove that Timmy is a fraudulent scientist, Cosmo and Wanda struggle to keep their existence a secret from the people of Retroville. Meanwhile, Professor Calamitous, a major villain in Jimmy&#x27;s universe, unleashes a surge of anti-fairies from Fairy World that threatens the rotation of Timmy&#x27;s Earth. Jorgen Von Strangle, the powerful fairy commander and enforcer of &quot;Da Rules&quot;, gets increasingly frustrated by both Jimmy and Timmy&#x27;s friends and their manipulation of fairy magic. In addition, Jorgen is forced to work with Calamitous after he is betrayed by the leader of the anti-fairies, Anti-Cosmo.

===&quot;The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 3: The Jerkinators&quot; (2006)===
In their third and final encounter, Jimmy and Timmy make amends while trying to defeat the enemies from their own universes—including a monster that they concoct together—while purposefully rejecting their respective friends in the process, including Cindy. Initially, they are unable to make the monster evil enough to fight them properly, but when they succeed, he almost immediately turns against them and absorbs Cosmo and Wanda&#x27;s magic and Jimmy&#x27;s intelligence, and then begins destroying both children&#x27;s universes.

==Production==
Each special in the &quot;Jimmy Timmy Power Hour&quot; series combines the 2D hand-drawn traditional animation of the &quot;Fairly OddParents&quot; and the 3D computer-generated imagery animation of &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot;. This blending of animation techniques was a technical challenge for the studios responsible for both series, according to Keith Alcorn, co-founder of series producer DNA Productions.

==Release and reception==
According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the first episode was seen by nearly five million viewers on its Nickelodeon premiere, on May 7, 2004. Terry Kelleher of &quot;People&quot; gave the first special three stars out of four, calling it a &quot;blast of creativity&quot; although hard to follow. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; similarly gave it praise. In his review of the DVD release, John Sinnott of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; called the first special &quot;an above-average extra-long episode.&quot; He also praised the &quot;funny gags&quot; for &quot;[Timmy and Jimmy] poke fun at each other&#x27;s setting and basically have a good time.&quot; The network considered it a success.

The second episode, aired January 16, 2006, was seen by nearly 5.5 million viewers, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The third and final episode aired July 21, 2006. It serves as the series finale for &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot;. It was also intended to be the series finale of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, until season six of that series was ordered for production by Nickelodeon.

In 2020, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked the trilogy specials at &quot;Nickelodeon: 5 Best Original Movies (&amp; 5 You Totally Forgot About)&quot;. In 2024, &quot;Game Rant&quot; ranked at number nine of &quot;9 Best Nickelodeon Cartoon Crossovers&quot;.

<text>Martin Gaston Biron (; born August 15, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender.

Drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the first round (16th overall) of the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, he spent the first half of his 16-year National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Sabres, later having stints with the Philadelphia Flyers, New York Islanders, and New York Rangers. He is currently a television analyst with the Sabres on MSG Western New York.

His younger brother Mathieu played 250 games in the NHL as a defenceman.

==Playing career==

As a youth, Biron played in the 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Charlesbourg, Quebec City.

Biron started his junior ice hockey career on the Beauport Harfangs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). He made his NHL debut with the Buffalo Sabres on December 26, 1995. An emergency call-up with the Sabres&#x27; top three goaltenders all injured, Biron became the fourth-youngest goaltender to start a game in NHL history, surrendering four first-period goals in a 6–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. After posting a 5.04 goals against average (GAA) with no wins and two losses during his fill-in stint, he was sent back to the QMJHL to develop further. After the 2000–01 season, he was a consistent goaltender for the Sabres as his play in the crease improved drastically.

Biron, along with Rob Ray and Dominik Hašek, was one of the three Sabres against whom, in three consecutive years, the NHL made a specific rule. After NHL statisticians discovered a bug in their new stat-tracking software, the &quot;Biron rule&quot; restricted jersey numbers to whole numbers between 1 and 99 (later limited to numbers between 1 and 98 after the league-wide retirement of number 99 for Wayne Gretzky). Biron was the only NHL player affected, as only he wore &quot;00&quot; at the time. (Goaltender John Davidson also wore 00 during his playing career, without rebuke, at various points between 1973 and 1983.) Upon his return to the NHL three seasons later, Biron switched to number 43, and wore that number until the end of his career.

Biron became the Sabres&#x27; starting goaltender after Hašek&#x27;s departure from Buffalo in 2001 and held the position until the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Biron has always been a fan favorite in Buffalo and although he no longer plays there, he currently resides in the city and after his retirement has a position as director of goaltending at HarborCenter, which is owned and operated by the Sabres organization.

Biron won his 13th consecutive game on December 17, 2005 against the Pittsburgh Penguins. He was the first goalie with 13 straight wins since Chris Osgood accomplished the feat during the 1995-1996 season.
After losing the number one goaltending job to emerging youngster Ryan Miller, Biron requested a trade from the Sabres on June 26, 2006, in an effort to receive more playing time. Finally, on February 27, 2007, the Sabres traded Biron to the Philadelphia Flyers for a second-round draft pick.

On March 27, 2007, Biron signed a two-year, $7 million contract extension with the Flyers to be the starting goaltender in Philadelphia. After appearing in 62 games and recording 30 wins in the 2007–08 season, he led the Flyers to the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in five games to the Eastern Conference champion Pittsburgh Penguins. He appeared in 55 games for the Flyers in the 2008–09 season, winning 29 and helping the Flyers to the fifth-overall seed in the Eastern Conference.
On July 1, 2009, Biron entered free agency. He was soon left in a difficult position after the Flyers signed goaltenders Ray Emery and Brian Boucher, while other teams quickly filled up their goaltending roster needs. Biron soon signed a one-year, $1.4 million contract with the New York Islanders on July 22, 2009, joining goaltenders Dwayne Roloson and Rick DiPietro. In 29 appearances, Biron recorded nine wins, 14 losses and four overtime losses, with a 3.27 goals against average and .896 save percentage. The Islanders did not qualify for the post-season.

On July 1, 2010, Biron signed a two-year, $1.75 million deal with the New York Rangers, where he prepared to back-up Swedish starter Henrik Lundqvist. Biron is one of six players in NHL history to skate for all three teams based in the state of New York. The others were Mike Donnelly, and former teammates Taylor Pyatt, Chad Johnson, Jason Dawe and Pat LaFontaine. Except for a 2-year stint with the Philadelphia Flyers,
Biron played almost his entire career in the state of New York.
On February 28, 2011, Biron fractured his collarbone during practice and was forced to miss the remainder of the 2010–11 season. While he played in the lowest number of games (17) since his second NHL season in 1998–99, he posted career highs in save percentage (.923) and goals against average (2.13).
On June 29, 2012 Biron re-signed with the Rangers in a one-way contract worth $2.6 million over two years, working out to an average of $1.3 million per year.

On October 14, 2013, the Rangers placed Biron on waivers after a poor start to the season, and the following day, he was assigned to play with the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (AHL). Biron announced his retirement via social media on October 20, 2013, choosing retirement over playing in the minor leagues. He ended his career with a 230–191–25–27 record, 2.62 goals against average and a .910 save percentage.

==Post-playing career==
He currently works as a studio analyst with the Sabres and the Sabres Hockey Network on MSG Western New York. Previously, he was an analyst on the TSN panel along with James Duthie, Aaron Ward and Bob McKenzie, worked on NHL Network, and did studio work for the New York Islanders. He is also the director of goaltending at the Academy of Hockey at the Buffalo HarborCenter. Biron also stars on the popular Buffalo sports podcast, &quot;Sabres Live&quot;, with Brian Duff.

On February 21, 2017, Biron received United States citizenship. He sought U.S. citizenship because he had married an American citizen and has resided with her and their four children in Buffalo for several years; but as he was not a U.S. citizen, he could not vote in American elections.

Biron was inducted into the Rochester Americans Hall of Fame on February 16, 2018.

==Family==
Martin&#x27;s son, Jacob, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a goaltender. After playing junior hockey in Buffalo and Kemptville, he joined the program at Army for the fall of 2024.

<doc id="714151" wikidata="Q2292400" url="?curid=714151" title="A Deepness in the Sky">
<text>A Deepness in the Sky is a science fiction novel by American writer Vernor Vinge. Published in 1999, the novel is a loose prequel (set 30,000 years previous) to his earlier novel &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; (1992). The title is coined by one of the story&#x27;s main characters in a debate, in a reference to the hibernating habits of his species and to the vastness of space.

==Plot summary==
An intelligent alien species is discovered to exist on the planet Arachna orbiting an anomalous star, dubbed OnOff. The star is named this because for 215 of every 250 years it is dormant, releasing almost no detectable energy. During this period, Arachna freezes and its fauna go into hibernation. The planet&#x27;s inhabitants, called &quot;Spiders&quot; by the humans for their resemblance to arachnids, have reached a stage of technological development very similar to that of Earth&#x27;s humans in the early 20th century, although humans believe that they may once have been capable of space travel. If this is true, then whoever can establish ties with the aliens first could reap unimaginable rewards; humans have made contact with only one other intelligent (but non-technological) alien species in millennia of travel through the stars. Two human groups launch expeditions to the Spider world: the Qeng Ho (pronounced &quot;Chung Ho&quot; and named after the explorer Zheng He), traders who have developed a common interstellar culture for humanity; and the Emergents, a civilization that enslaves selected human minds and has only recently re-emerged from a Dark Age.

The Qeng Ho arrive at the OnOff star shortly before the Emergent fleet, a few years before the star turns on, at which point the Spider civilization will &quot;wake up&quot; and continue its climb into a technological civilization. A reception held by the Emergents doubles as a vector to infect the Qeng Ho with a timed &quot;mindrot&quot; virus. The Emergents time an ambush to take advantage of the onset of symptoms.

During these events, a concurrent history of the Spider civilization unfolds – mainly through the picaresque (and then increasingly political and technocratic) experiences of a small group of progressive-minded Spiders. Their struggles against ignorance and obsolescent traditions are colored with oddly human-like descriptions and nomenclature, prefiguring some major plot revelations towards the end of the story.

Far above, after a close fight, the Emergents subjugate the Qeng Ho. However, losses to both sides force them to combine and adopt the so-called &quot;Lurker strategy,&quot; monitoring and aiding the Spiders&#x27; technological development while waiting until they build up the massive infrastructure and technological base that the visitors need in order to repair their vessels.

The mindrot virus originally manifested itself on the Emergents&#x27; home world as a devastating plague, but they subsequently mastered it and learned to use it both as a weapon and as a tool for mental domination. Emergent culture uses mindrot primarily in the form of a variant which technicians can manipulate in order to release neurotoxins to specific parts of the brain. An active MRI-type device triggers changes through dia- and paramagnetic biological molecules. By manipulating the brain in this way, Emergent managers induce obsession with a single idea or specialty, which they call Focus, essentially turning people into brilliant appliances. Many Qeng Ho become Focused against their will, and the Emergents retain the rest of the population under mass surveillance, with only a portion of the crew not in suspended animation. The Qeng Ho trading culture gradually starts to dilute this, by demonstrating to the Emergents certain benefits of tolerated and restricted free trade; the two human cultures merge to some extent over the decades of forced co-operation.

Pham Nuwen, the founder of the Qeng Ho trading culture, is living aboard the fleet under the pseudonym Pham Trinli, posing as an inept and bumbling fleet elder. He subverts the Emergents&#x27; own oppressive security systems through a series of high-risk ruses. During his plotting he begins to admire the Emergents&#x27; Focus technology, seeing it as the missing link in his lifelong goal to create a true interstellar empire and break the cycle of collapse and rebuild that plagues human planetary civilizations.

The plan to wrest fleet control from the Emergents, however, requires the co-operation of Ezr Vinh, a much younger Qeng Ho who, through attrition, has become the Qeng Ho &quot;Fleet Manager.&quot; Ezr&#x27;s position as the unique liaison officer between Qeng Ho and Emergents leads him to despair, and he accepts Pham Nuwen&#x27;s offer to join a plot against the Emergents as a way to personal redemption as well as to take revenge against the Emergents. However, his understanding of Pham&#x27;s ambitions for Focus technology leads to a confrontation between them over the future use of Focus by the Qeng Ho. With new knowledge of the effects and victims of Focus, Pham is forced to admit the cost is too high, and the two reach an agreement and continue their plotting.

The critical moment comes when the Emergents attempt to provoke a nuclear war on the Spider home-world in order to seize power. The conspirators subvert the Emergents&#x27; systems and put their plans in action, but so do a small group of Spiders who have become aware of the humans and have been working in secret for years to subvert their Focused as well. Together, the two sides successfully defeat the ruling class of the Emergents.

The combined Emergent/Qeng Ho fleet now negotiates with the Spider civilization as a trading partner. Pham announces his plans to free all of the Focused in the entire Emergent civilization, and, if he survives that, to go to the Galactic Center to find the source of the OnOff star and the strange technology remnants that have clearly traveled with it.

==Elements==

===Interstellar culture===
The book discusses some of the problems of trying to maintain an interstellar trading culture without access to superluminal travel or to superluminal communication. Time-measurement details provide an interesting concept in the book: the Qeng Ho measure time primarily in terms of seconds, since the notion of days, months, and years has no usefulness between various star-systems. The timekeeping system uses terms such as kiloseconds and megaseconds. The Qeng Ho&#x27;s computer and timekeeping systems feature the advent of &quot;programmer archaeologists&quot;: the Qeng Ho are packrats of computer programs and systems, retaining them over millennia, even as far back to the era of Unix programs (as implied by one passage mentioning that the fundamental time-keeping system is the Unix epoch):

This massive accumulation of data implies that almost any useful program one could want already exists in the Qeng Ho fleet library, hence the need for computer archaeologists to dig up needed programs, work around their peculiarities and bugs, and assemble them into useful constructs.

===Time===
The Qeng Ho and other spacers in this series use kiloseconds (roughly 17 minutes), megaseconds (roughly 11.6 days), and gigaseconds (roughly 32 years) as units of time.

===Localizers===

With this work, Vinge introduces &quot;localizers&quot; to his set of science-fiction concepts. Localizers are tiny devices which can contain a simple processor, sensors, and short-range communications. Vinge explores how intelligent control can use mesh networking of these devices in ways quite different from those of traditional computer networks.

===Relation to &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;===
Only one concrete connection links &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot; with &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;: the character of Pham Nuwen, the &quot;Programmer-at-Arms&quot;, who appears in both books. Hints occur about the &quot;Zones of Thought&quot; mentioned in &quot;Fire&quot;. That novel posits that space around the Milky Way is divided into concentric layers called &quot;Zones,&quot; each being constrained by different laws of physics and each allowing for different degrees of biological and technological advancement. The innermost, the &quot;Unthinking Depths,&quot; surrounds the galactic core and is incapable of supporting advanced life forms at all. The next layer, the &quot;Slow Zone,&quot; is roughly equivalent to the real world in behavior and potential. Further out, the zone named the &quot;Beyond&quot; can support futuristic technologies such as AI and FTL travel. The outermost zone, the &quot;Transcend,&quot; contains most of the galactic halo and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful posthuman entities.

&quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot; takes place in the Slow Zone, though Vinge does not explain the connections, and the characters in the story remain unaware of the zones&#x27; existence. The sun&#x27;s inexplicably strange behavior, the unusual planetary system (with only a solitary planet and several asteroid-sized diamonds), and the discovery of &quot;cavorite&quot; on the planet may indicate the system originated in the Transcend, though it is currently moving outward from the Unthinking Depths. Vinge&#x27;s characters speculate that the Spiders descend from minor life forms living amongst an ancient star-faring civilization, and that the anti-gravity material and other strange artifacts have connections with that civilization. Unfortunately, they guess the structure of the Zones (though not the actual properties) backwards, coming to the conclusion that the bright center of the galaxy is the most likely location for advanced civilization. This leads Pham on his path inwards to the Unthinking Depths, and his eventual resurrection.

===Relation to &quot;The Outcasts of Heaven Belt&quot;===
Joan D. Vinge has indicated that her novel &quot;The Outcasts of Heaven Belt&quot; is also set in the Slow Zone of the Zones of Thought setting. Both novels show their spacefaring civilizations using seconds, kiloseconds, megaseconds, and gigaseconds as their primary units of time.

==Reception==
&quot;Deepness&quot; won the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 2000 John W. Campbell Memorial Award, the 2000 Prometheus Award and the 2004 Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis for Best Foreign Fiction; as well, it was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel, the 2000 Arthur C. Clarke Award,
and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

Nick Gevers called &quot;Deepness&quot; &quot;one of the best constructed and most absorbing space operas of the decade,&quot; and commented that its &quot;shrewd triumph&quot; is that neither optimism nor pessimism defeats the other. John Clute lauded it as &quot;the most extended example of dramatic irony ever published,&quot; in that not only do none of the characters ever learn the truth about the universe, neither does anyone who has not read &quot;Fire&quot;; he did, however, criticize &quot;the odd dozen-page segments given over to hard-SF geekishness about orbits and computers and stuff.&quot;

The &quot;SF Site&quot;″s Greg L. Johnson considered the novel to be &quot;deceptively straight-forward,&quot; and at &quot;Strange Horizons&quot;, Amy Harlib praised it as &quot;huge, complex and captivating&quot; and &quot;rich and satisfying and deserving of its award,&quot; emphasizing that it is the equal of its predecessor work. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described it as a &quot;chilling, spellbinding dramatization of the horrors of slavery and mind control,&quot; while &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; noted that it would &quot;fully engage&quot; readers&#x27; sense of wonder, and correctly predicted that it would be nominated for the Hugo Award.

<text>tin is an open-source, text-based, threaded newsreader, used to read and post messages on Usenet, the worldwide distributed discussion system.

==History==
Tin was initially used on text-only computer terminals connected via a slow serial interface to a multi-user time sharing central server, where graphics were generally not supported and when the computer mouse did not yet exist. At the time, tin was considered to be somewhat of a high-resource program in this environment (similar to Pine) due to its use of terminal cursor control and page-oriented text scrolling to make navigating Usenet easier. While it did not have graphics support it does provide a visually organized browser-oriented drill-down list of groups, subjects, and then articles, as opposed to simply scrolling endless pages and menus upward from the bottom of the screen.

Tin is available for a variety of Unix-like operating systems. It is based on the TASS newsreader, whose source code had been posted in 1991 on Usenet by Rich Skrenta.
The work on tin was begun shortly afterward by Iain Lea, who provided information for the IETF RFC 2980.
Since 1996, tin has been maintained by Urs Janßen.

The program is generally compared with trn or nn.
The latter is also based on TASS.
Some note that tin has the most flexible threading support.

Tin runs on any UNIX or POSIX platform. This is because tin was an early adopter of autoconf, in 1996. Older versions of tin also ran on OpenVMS; the newer versions which have UTF-8 support do not.

The original tin used termcap. Along with the portability improvements gained by using autoconf, its developers improved the adaptability by making it work with terminfo or curses—again improving portability. Other changes, such as localization using gettext, as well as IPv6 support have kept the application current.

Unlike trn or nn, it is easy to follow the progress of changes since 1995 in tin because its changelog is detailed and dated.

<doc id="714155" wikidata="Q233965" url="?curid=714155" title="Charles Nicolle">
<text>Charles Jules Henri Nicolle (21 September 1866 – 28 February 1936) was a French bacteriologist who received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his identification of lice as the transmitter of epidemic typhus.

== Family ==
Nicolle was born to Aline Louvrier and Eugène Nicolle in Rouen, France and was raised as part of a middle-class family that valued education. He had two other siblings – his older brother, Maurice Nicolle (a medical microbiologist, professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and Director of the Bacteriological Institute of Constantinople), and his younger brother, Marcel Nicolle (an art critic).

Nicole later married Alice Avice in 1895 and had two children, Marcelle (b. 1896) and Pierre (b. 1898), both of whom also went on to enter the medical field.

== Studies and career ==
The earliest educational influences on Nicolle were from his father, a doctor at a Rouen hospital. Nicolle later received his education from the &quot;Lycée Pierre Corneille&quot; in Rouen, followed by his medical degree from the Pasteur Institute of Paris in 1893. At this point he returned to Rouen, as a member of the Medical Faculty until 1896 and then as Director of the Bacteriological Laboratory from 1896 to 1902. Around this time, Nicolle also became deaf. He did just that in 1903, when he became Director of the Pasteur Institute in Tunis and conducted his Nobel Prize-winning work on typhus, bringing Hélène Sparrow with him as laboratory chief. He was still director of the Institute when he died in 1936. 

=== Directing the Pasteur Institute in Tunis ===
Before Nicolle took on the position of leading the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, the Pasteur Institute in Paris remained the predominant centre for research in France as it aimed to combine medical research, teaching, and public service (treatment of diseases) under Pasteurian missionary principles. However, under Nicolle’s guidance over the next 33 years, the &#x27;sister&#x27; Institute in Tunis quickly became an international centre of its own for the production of vaccines used against infectious diseases and for medical research.

Nicolle’s success in expanding the Pasteur Institute in Tunis lies primarily in his deviation from the traditional Pasteurian ideology that mandated that medical aid and research be done in a nonprofit manner. Nicolle instead actively sought to build relations with the local Tunisian and French healthcare officials and organized the Institute such that other medical functions (such as caring for sick patients) would monetarily support the Institute&#x27;s ongoing laboratory research. Doing so gave him autonomy to run the Institute without relying on public or governmental funds. As the Institute grew more financially stable, Nicolle tackled the diseases and public health concerns that were prevalent in the local region, shared research findings and resources with the Paris Institute, and expanded his scientific writings into a journal called the &quot;Archives de l’Institut de Tunis&quot;. He also became a key point of contact for the French government when new epidemics arose that required his intervention – such as in the malaria epidemic of 1906 and the cholera outbreak of 1907.

During this time, Nicolle also undertook two major projects that would come to define his role in the scientific communitythe discovery of the mode of transmission of typhus (an infectious disease prevalent throughout North Africa and the Mediterranean Basin at that time) and the production of vaccines.

=== Discovery of the vector transmitting typhus ===
Nicolle&#x27;s discovery came about first from his observation that, while epidemic typhus patients were able to infect other patients inside and outside the hospital, and their very clothes seemed to spread the disease, they were no longer infectious when they had had a hot bath and a change of clothes. Once he realized this, he reasoned that it was most likely that lice were the vector for epidemic typhus.

Because studying the transmission of typhus required that the parasite be alive (needed a human host), scientists were only able to study it during epidemic times. However, Nicolle found that the chimpanzee served as a suitable alternate host for this study since it was genetically similar to humans, and in June 1909, Nicolle tested his theory by infecting a chimpanzee with typhus, retrieving the lice from it, and placing it on a healthy chimpanzee. Within 10 days, the second chimpanzee had typhus as well. After repeating his experiment, he was sure of it: lice were the carriers. As Nicolle continued his ongoing research on the disease, he later switched to using guinea pigs as his model organism instead of chimpanzees as they were just as susceptible to infection and were also smaller and cheaper.

An important finding from further research showed that the major transmission method was not louse bites but excrement: lice infected with typhus turn red and die after a couple of weeks, but in the meantime, they excrete a large number of microbes. When a small quantity of this is rubbed on the skin or eye, an infection occurs.

Nicolle’s work was not only influential in containing the typhus epidemics that occurred in the region but also helped scientists distinguish the typhus fever caused by lice from murine typhus, which is transmitted by fleas.

=== Attempt at a vaccine ===
Nicolle surmised that he could make a simple vaccine by crushing up the lice and mixing it with blood serum from recovered patients. He first tried this vaccine on himself, and when he stayed healthy he tried it on a few children (because of their better immune systems), who developed typhus but recovered.

He did not succeed in his effort to develop a practical vaccine. The next step would be taken by Rudolf Weigl in 1930.

Despite being unable to develop a vaccination against typhus, Nicolle did make several other key discoveries in the field of vaccination. He was the first to determine that sodium fluoride was a good reagent to sterilize parasites (so that they are no longer infectious) while also preserving their structure (to use in vaccines). Using this method, he developed vaccines for gonorrhea, some staphylococcal infections, and cholera. These vaccines were not only used throughout France but were also sent worldwide.

== Accomplishments ==
Nicolle&#x27;s major accomplishments in bacteriology and parasitology were:
*The discovery of the transmission method of typhus fever
*The introduction of a vaccination for Malta fever
*The discovery of the transmission method of tick fever
*His studies of cancer, scarlet fever, rinderpest, measles, influenza, tuberculosis and trachoma.
*Identification of the parasitic organism &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; within the tissues of the gundi (&quot;Ctenodactylus gundi&quot;), which is commonly found in AIDS patients
*His study of the parasitic microorganism Leishmania tropica that caused the Oriental sore (a type of skin boil)

== Additional information ==

=== Major works ===
During his life Nicolle wrote a number of non-fiction and bacteriology books, including:

* &quot;Le Destin des Maladies infectieuses&quot; (1933)
* &quot;La Nature, conception et morale biologiques&quot; (1934)
* &quot;Responsabilités de la Médecine&quot; (1935)
* &quot;La Destinée humaine&quot; (1936)

He also wrote fiction and philosophy throughout his life, including:

* &quot;Le Pâtissier de Bellone&quot; (1913)
* &quot;Les deux Larrons&quot; (1929)
* &quot;Les Contes de Marmouse&quot; (1930)

===Religious views===
Baptized a Catholic, Nicolle left the faith when he was twelve. Starting in 1934, he felt spiritual anxiety, and he was reconciled with the Church in August 1935 after communicating with a Jesuit priest.

<text>Linda Frances Elide Lusardi (born 18 September 1958) is an English actress, television presenter and former glamour model.

==Early life==
Lusardi was born in Wood Green, London, to Lilian (née Glassman; 1932–2023) and Nello Lusardi (1930–2017). Her mother was born in Edmonton, Middlesex and her father in Hackney, East London, to Italian parents. Lusardi grew up in Palmers Green.

<text> (), also known as the Māori Party, is a political party in New Zealand advocating Māori rights. With the exception of a handful of general electorates, contests the reserved Māori electorates, in which its main rival is the Labour Party.

Under the current leadership of Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, it promotes the following policies: the upholding of , the dismantling of systemic racism, and the strengthening of the rights and promised in . The party is also committed to a mixture of socially progressive and green policy through a &quot;-centric&quot; lens. This includes eradicating Goods and Services Tax on food, opposing deep sea drilling, organising and funding a Māori health authority, lifting the minimum wage to $25 an hour, returning Department of Conservation land to Māori , and reducing homelessness. Since Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer&#x27;s leadership began in 2020, the party has been described as left-wing, and progressive.

Tariana Turia founded the Māori Party in 2004 after resigning from the governing Labour Party, in which she served as a minister, over the foreshore and seabed ownership controversy. She and Pita Sharples, a high-profile academic, became the first co-leaders. The party won four Māori seats in the 2005 election and went into Opposition. After the 2008, 2011 and 2014 elections, where the party won five, three and two Māori seats respectively, it supported a government led by the centre-right National Party, with the Māori Party co-leaders serving as ministers outside cabinet. During this time, the party advocated more moderate politics.

The party won no seats in the 2017 election, which was analysed as being backlash for their support of National. Under new leadership they returned at the 2020 general election, when Rawiri Waititi won the Waiariki electorate. Although the party&#x27;s share of the country-wide party vote declined from 1.18% in 2017 to 1.17% in 2020, winning Waiariki gave the party the right to full proportional representation, giving it two MPs, with co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer subsequently becoming a list MP. Waititi joined Ngarewa-Packer as co-leader in October 2020 and the pair led the party to win six electorate seats and 3.08% of the popular vote in the 2023 general election.

== History ==

=== Formation ===

The origins of Te Pāti Māori can be traced back to the 2004 foreshore and seabed controversy, a debate about whether the Māori have legitimate claim to ownership of part or all of New Zealand&#x27;s foreshore and seabed that arose during the Fifth Labour Government. A court judgement stated that some Māori appeared to have the right to seek formal ownership of a specific portion of seabed in the Marlborough Sounds. This prospect alarmed many sectors of New Zealand society however, and the Labour Party foreshadowed legislation in favour of state ownership instead. This angered many Māori, including many of Labour&#x27;s Māori MPs. Two MPs representing Māori electorates, Tariana Turia and Nanaia Mahuta, announced an intent to vote against the legislation.

Turia, a junior minister, after being informed that voting against the government would appear &quot;incompatible&quot; with holding ministerial rank, announced on 30 April 2004 her intention to resign from the Labour Party. Her resignation took effect on 17 May, and she left parliament until she won a by-election in her Te Tai Hauauru seat two months later. After leaving the Labour Party, Turia, later joined by Sharples, began organising a new political party. They and their supporters agreed that the new organisation would simply use the name of &quot;the Māori Party&quot;. They chose a logo of black and red—traditional Māori colours—incorporating a traditional koru design. The party constitution provides that there are two party co-leaders, one male and one female. Turia and Sharples were the first to fill these roles. They indicated that they wished to unite &quot;all Māori&quot; into a single political movement. The party was formally established on 7 July 2004.

=== 2005 election and first term in Parliament ===

In the 2005 election, the Māori Party won four out of seven Māori seats and 2.12% of the party vote. The latter entitled the party to only three list seats, so the fourth electorate seat caused an overhang seat. In the election night count, the party vote share was under 2% and the Māori Party would have got two overhang seats; when the overhang was reduced to one, National lost a list seat that they appeared to have won on election night. Tariana Turia held Te Tai Hauauru; Pita Sharples won the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate; Hone Harawira, son of Titewhai Harawira, won Te Tai Tokerau; and Te Ururoa Flavell won Waiariki.

In the post-election period the Māori Party convened a series of hui to decide whether to support Labour or National, though some party leaders indicated they preferred to deal with Labour. National Party deputy leader Gerry Brownlee and leader Don Brash tried to win over the Māori Party and claimed that it would support National to form a government, although Turia denied this. She met privately with prime minister Helen Clark and ruled out a formal coalition. Later, the Māori Party decided to remain in opposition and not be part of a Labour-led government.

On 24 January 2006 the Māori Party&#x27;s four MPs were jointly welcomed to Rātana pā with Brash and a delegation of eight National MPs. They had been intended to be welcomed on half an hour apart but agreed to be welcomed and sit together. Turia disputed claims that this was pre-arranged, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re here for a birthday. We&#x27;re not here for politics.&quot; However critics said this would have reminded onlookers of how the Māori Party and National were said to be in coalition or confidence and supply talks. This may also have served to reinforce the Labour Party&#x27;s election campaign statement that a &#x27;vote for the Māori Party is a vote for National&#x27;. One Rātana kaumatua (elder) said this was deliberate and deserved after the talks.

=== Supporting a National-led government: 2008–2017 ===

In the 2008 general election the Māori Party retained all four of the seats it won in 2005, and won an additional seat, when Rahui Katene won Te Tai Tonga from Labour. Two seats were overhang seats. The party&#x27;s share of the party vote rose slightly to 2.39%. The Labour Party won the party vote by a large majority in every Māori electorate, meaning that the typical Māori voter had split their vote, voting for a Māori Party candidate with their electorate vote and the Labour Party with their party vote.

The National Party won the most seats overall and formed a minority government with the support of the Māori Party, ACT New Zealand and United Future. Sharples was given the Minister of Māori Affairs portfolio and became an Associate Minister of Corrections and Associate Minister of Education. Turia became Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Associate Minister of Health and Associate Minister for Social Development and Employment. Hone Harawira was critical of the alliance with the National Party and was suspended from the Māori Party in February 2011. He left the party and formed the left-wing Mana Party in April 2011.

Competing against Mana, the Māori Party&#x27;s strength diminished. In the 2011 general election, it won only three electorates (with 1.43% of the party vote, the party was entitled to two seats, resulting in an overhang of one seat). The three MPs were Pita Sharples in Tāmaki Makaurau, Tariana Turia in Te Tai Hauāuru and Te Ururoa Flavell in Waiāriki. Rahui Katene lost the Te Tai Tonga seat to Labour&#x27;s Rino Tirikatene, and Hone Harawira won the Te Tai Tokerau seat for the Mana Party. The National Party again formed a minority government with the support of the Māori Party, ACT New Zealand and United Future. Sharples and Turia were returned as ministers outside cabinet. Ahead of the 2014 general election, Flavell became the male co-leader. Neither Sharples nor Turia stood for re-election. At the election, Flavell held Waiāriki electorate seat, and the party was entitled to one further list seat as it received 1.32% of the party vote. This went to Marama Fox, who became the next female co-leader.

Prior to the 2017 general election, the Māori Party formed an electoral pact with the Mana Movement leader and former Māori Party MP Hone Harawira. The Māori Party agreed not to contest Te Tai Tokerau as part of a deal for the two parties to try to regain the Māori electorates from the Labour Party. In the election, they failed to take any seats, with Labour capturing all seven of the Māori electorates. Party co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell expressed sadness at the loss of seats and announced he would be resigning from politics. Fellow co-leader Marama Fox expressed bitterness at the party&#x27;s defeat, remarking that New Zealand had chosen to return to the &quot;age of colonization&quot; and attacked the two major parties, National and Labour, for their alleged paternalism towards Māori. Fox commented that Māori have &quot;gone back like a beaten wife to the abuser&quot; in regards to Labour&#x27;s sweep of the Māori seats. &quot;Metro Magazine&quot; described the Māori Party&#x27;s poor results as being part of backlash against them for helping National form a government. Within the following 12 months, the party’s senior figures resigned: Flavell and Fox stepped down from the co-leadership and party president Tukoroirangi Morgan also resigned. This opened the field for a new generation of party leaders, namely Rāwiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer.

=== 2020 general election ===

The party announced John Tamihere as its candidate for the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate in March 2020. Tamihere had held the electorate from 2002 to 2005, but for the Labour Party. He had also run for Mayor of Auckland in 2019 without success. Tamihere&#x27;s mayoral campaign was more right-wing, and he said the Māori Party could happily work with the National Party. This contradicted Māori Party President Che Wilson, who had set out a clear preference to work with Labour and had said &quot;if we ever do talk to National it will have to be a big deal for us to move that way again.&quot;

On 15 April 2020, the party announced that John Tamihere and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer were the new party co-leaders.

In late May 2020, the party received a broadcasting allocation of $145,101 for the 2020 election.

In September 2020, Ikaroa-Rāwhiti candidate Heather Te Au-Skipworth released the party&#x27;s sports policy which included establishing a national Māori sporting body and investing in Māori sporting scholarships and programs. She also stated &quot;it is a known fact that Māori genetic makeup is stronger than others... Our ancestors were not just athletic, they were also strategic thinkers with intentions to survive. This all required stamina, resilience, endurance, speed, agility and logic.&quot; The genetic superiority remarks were subsequently deleted prior to the 2023 New Zealand general election.

At the 2020 general election, held in October, the Māori Party&#x27;s Rawiri Waititi captured the Waiariki electorate, defeating Labour MP Tāmati Coffey by a margin of 836 votes. This allowed the Māori Party to enter Parliament, and with its party vote of 1.2%, it was entitled to two MPs. After Waititi, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer entered Parliament as the highest-ranked person on the party list. As the only male Māori Party MP, Waititi replaced Tamihere as a co-leader.

On 11 November, former party co-leader Tamihere requested a vote recount in the Māori electorates of Tāmaki Makaurau and Te Tai Hauāuru, alleging Māori voters had encountered discrimination during the 2020 election. Tamihere claimed that the recount was intended to expose discriminatory laws such as the five-yearly Māori Electoral Option (which limited the ability of Māori to switch between the general and Māori rolls for a period five years). He also alleged longer wait times for Māori voters at election booths and some Māori not being allowed to vote on the Māori roll.

=== 2020–2023 parliamentary term ===

On 26 November 2020, Te Pāti Māori MPs Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer walked out of Parliament after the Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard did not allow them to speak due to parliamentary procedures limiting the speaking time by smaller parties. Waititi had attempted to pass a motion that their party leaders be allowed to give a 15-minute &quot;address in reply&quot; but Mallard had blocked the motion on the grounds that MPs from smaller parties were not scheduled to give their maiden speeches until the following week. Waititi described Mallard&#x27;s decision as unfair while Ngarewa-Packer claimed that this was &quot;another example of the Māori voice being silenced and ignored.&quot;

==== 2020 election donations investigation ====

On 12 April 2021, the Electoral Commission referred Te Pāti Māori to the Police for failing to disclose about NZ$320,000 worth of donations within the required timeframe. These donations came from several individuals and organisations including former party co-leader Tamihere (NZ$158,223.72), the Urban Māori Authority (NZ$48,879.85), and the Aotearoa Te Kahu Limited Partnership (NZ$120,000). Party President Che Wilson attributed the late disclosure to the fact that the party was staffed by volunteers and rookies who were unfamiliar with electoral finance laws. On 29 April, the Police referred the investigation into the Māori Party&#x27;s undeclared donations to the Serious Fraud Office. By late September 2022, the Serious Fraud Office had closed the investigation and decided not to pursue prosecutions against the individuals and parties involved.

In late September 2022, Charities Services general manager Natasha Weight confirmed that the agency was investigating two charities headed by Party President Tamihere, the Te Whānau Waipareira Trust and the National Urban Māori Authority, for financing his 2020 election campaign. According to the Charities Register, Te Whānau o Waipareira Trust Group had loaned Tamihere NZ$385,307 to support his 2020 election campaign while the National Urban Māori Authority had paid NZ$82,695 to support his 2020 election campaign and Te Pāti Māori aspirations. Under existing legislation, charities are not allowed to donate and endorse political parties and candidates or allow them to use a charity&#x27;s resources. In response, Tamihere accused the Charities Services of discriminating against Te Pāti Māori and Māori causes. Tamihere and Te Pāti Māori also confirmed that they would litigate against the Charities Service if the agency ruled against them. Tamihere also criticised &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; journalist Matt Nippert&#x27;s coverage of the two charities&#x27; donations to his campaigns, accusing the newspaper of racism and announcing that Te Pāti Māori would boycott the &quot;Herald&quot;.

==== Hate Speech Task Force, 2021 ====

In June 2021, Te Pāti Māori called for a joint task force between the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and New Zealand Police targeting right-wing extremists and rising anti-Māori hate speech in response to a YouTube video featuring a masked man calling for the slaughter of Māori and for a civil war. The video was later removed by YouTube for a breach of its community guidelines. In a tweet, the party said that the video contained threats against its MPs, marae and Māori. Police arrested a man after receiving multiple complaints about the video and a day after Te Pāti Māori laid a complaint with the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA). A 44-year-old male was charged with making an objectionable publication.

In the complaint to the IPCA, the party accused the police of having double standards when dealing with death threats made against Pākehā and Māori. It compared the police&#x27;s response to the video with the treatment of those who made death threats against National MP Simeon Brown. Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer stated, &quot;Communication and response time was inadequate, the police have continued to minimise the nature of the threat against us and our people&quot;.

==== Racial discrimination ====

On 29 August 2023, Te Pāti Māori made a series of tweets apologizing to refugee and migrant communities for &quot;harmful narratives&quot; of &quot;xenophobia and racism&quot; on their official party website. Te Pāti Māori said they had removed words for their website and was rewriting policy documents. An example of policy rewriting included the &quot;Indigenous First&quot; framework in the party&#x27;s Whānau Build policy. The policy indicated the intent to place Māori housing needs before all others. In 2022, Te Pāti Māori also removed a reference from its sports policy that said Māori genetic makeup was stronger than others. The now removed statement read, &quot;It is a known fact that Māori genetic makeup is stronger than others.&quot;

==== Whaitiri joins party ====

On 3 May 2023, sitting minister Meka Whaitiri announced that she had left the Labour Party to join Te Pāti Māori. Speaker of the House Adrian Rurawhe confirmed that Whaitiri would serve the remainder of her 2020–2023 term as an independent member of Parliament under standing order 35(5), which avoids invoking the &quot;waka-jumping&quot; provisions of the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act 2018. Whaitiri does not sit with her party in Parliament. She will recontest the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate as a Māori Party candidate.

On 10 May, Ngarewa-Packer and Waititi held a haka (dance) during Parliamentary proceedings to welcome Whaitiri to the Māori Party. In response, Rurawhe ordered Ngarewa-Packer and Waititi to leave Parliament since they had not obtained the permission of the Speaker or other parliamentary parties to hold the haka.

==== Name change ====

On 12 July, the party formally changed their name with the electoral commission from the Māori Party to Te Pāti Māori.

=== 2023 election ===

Te Pāti Māori launched its 2023 general election campaign at Te Whānau O Waipareira&#x27;s Matariki event in Henderson, Auckland on 14 July. The party campaigned on advancing the interests of the Māori people, combating racism, and the &quot;second-rate&quot; status of Māori, as Ngarewa-Packer labelled it.

On 27 July, the party announced several redistributive tax policies including a zero tax policy on those earning below NZ$30,000, a new 48% tax on those earning above NZ$300,000, raising the companies tax rate back to 33% and a wealth tax on millionaires. On 2 August, the party campaigned on ending state care for Māori children and replacing the present Oranga Tamariki (Ministry for Children) with an independent Mokopuna Māori Authority that would network with Māori organisations, iwi (tribes), and hapū (sub-groups) to ensure that Māori children remained connected with their whakapapa (genealogies).

In late August 2023, Te Pāti Māori revised its Whanau Build (housing) policy to eliminate an &quot;indigenous first&quot; provision which called for immigration to be curbed until the country&#x27;s housing supply was addressed. The party also apologised to migrant and refugee communities for promoting what it described as &quot;harmful narratives&quot; on its website, and reiterated that it would treat everyone like how they would be treated as guests on a marae.

During an interview with TVNZ journalist Jack Tame in September 2023, Waititi also denied that his party&#x27;s sports policy&#x27; comments about &quot;Māori genetic makeup being stronger than others&quot; were racist. These comments were subsequently deleted from Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s website. When challenged by Tame, he responded that TPM was &quot;trying to empower people that are climbing out from the bottom of the bonnet of colonial violence for the last 193 years&quot; by encouraging pride in their heritage.

Te Pāti Māori won six electorate seats and 3.08% of the popular vote. Meka Whaitiri stood as the party&#x27;s candidate in the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate but was defeated by Labour&#x27;s candidate Cushla Tangaere-Manuel. Despite Whaitiri&#x27;s unseating, the 2023 election outcome was Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s most successful election result.

=== 2023–present: In opposition ===

Ngarewa Packer stated that the party would serve as &quot;the only true opposition&quot; in Parliament for the next term, adding that their plans were &quot;to shake Parliament up and normalise it for Māori.&quot; During the opening of the 54th New Zealand Parliament on 5 December 2023, Te Pāti Māori organised a series of nationwide protests known as the National Māori Action Day to protest against the National-led coalition government&#x27;s policies on co-governance and the Treaty of Waitangi. The party&#x27;s MPs also modified their oaths of allegiances to reference the Treaty of Waitangi.

In late May 2024, Te Pāti Māori and the Toitu Te Tiriti movement called for a nationwide day of protest known as &quot;Toitū Te Tiriti National Day of Action&quot; to coincide with the release of the 2024 New Zealand budget on 30 May. The protest was in opposition to the National-led government perceived assault on Tangata whenua and the Treaty of Waitangi. The party urged all Māori to go on strike and attend hīkoi (protests) near their location. Protest action includes a car convoy traveling from State Highway 1 south of Auckland to Hamilton. Te Pāti Māori claimed that 100,000 people attended the &quot;car-koi activation&quot; rallies nationwide and advocated the establishment of a Māori parliament.

On 14 November 2024, Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke along with co-leaders Waititi, Ngarewa-Packer and Labour MP Peeni Henare led a haka (ka mate) that disrupted vote proceedings during the first reading of ACT party leader David Seymour&#x27;s contentious Treaty Principles Bill. On 10 December, the four were referred to Parliament&#x27;s Privileges Committee for their disruptive actions.

On 4 February 2025, Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer proposed the creation of a Parliamentary Commissioner for Te Tiriti o Waitangi, who would have extraordinary powers to audit bills and issue a &quot;Tiriti veto&quot; if policy and bills did not comply with the Treaty. They said this would be a &quot;bottomline&quot; in any coalition negotiations during events leading up to Waitangi Day at the Treaty Grounds. In response, ACT leader Seymour accused Te Pāti Māori of attempting to &quot;break democracy&quot; and urged Labour leader Chris Hipkins to rule out such as policy. Hipkins said he would not support TPM&#x27;s policy for a Te Tiriti Commissioner with the powers to overturn law but added he was open to ensuring there were better &quot;checks and balances&quot; in New Zealand&#x27;s constitutional framework.

==== 2023 election data breach allegations ====
On 2 June 2024, the &quot;Sunday Star Times&quot; journalist Andrea Vance reported that Statistics New Zealand was investigating allegations by former staff at Manurewa Marae that Te Pāti Māori had illegally used 2023 New Zealand census data to target Māori electorate voters in the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate during the 2023 election, and that participants were given supermarket vouchers, wellness packs and food parcels to encourage them to fill out census forms and switch to the Māori electoral roll. Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s candidate Takutai Moana Kemp had won the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate during the 2023 general election. A whistleblower from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) had alerted Statistics NZ and the Police. In response, Te Pāti Māori leader Tamihere denied the allegations and claimed that they were made by disgruntled former staff. Tamihere said that the marae had been working with the Whānau Ora Commissioning Agency to promote Māori participation in the 2023 census. Tamihere also acknowledged that marae workers had given gifts to encourage people to participate in the 2023 Census and switch to the Māori roll but denied allegations of wrongdoing.

On 5 June, Vance reported that the Labour Party had filed a complaint against Te Pāti Māori in November 2023 for allegedly using personal information collected during the COVID-19 immunisation programme for political campaigning purposes during the 2023 election, which constitutes a breach of electoral law. Labour&#x27;s complaint alleged that Māori voters in Auckland had received two text messages from the text code 2661 urging them to vote for Te Pāti Māori. 2661 was registered with the Waipareira Trust, which is led by TPM&#x27;s President Tamihere. In response, Labour leader Chris Hipkins, ACT New Zealand leader David Seymour, Prime Minister and National Party leader Christopher Luxon called for an investigation into the allegations against TPM. The Privacy Commissioner also confirmed that Statistics NZ had alerted it to a potential privacy breach during its investigation. Chief statistician Mark Sowden also called for anyone with information to contact Statistics NZ. In response to the second allegations, Tamihere issued a press release denouncing the allegations as baseless and claiming that the party was being targeted by opponents for speaking up for Māori. Tamihere also accused Destiny Church leader Brian Tamaki and his followers of attempting to take over Manurewa Marae.

On 7 June, co-leaders Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer called for an urgent Police investigation into the data breach allegations made against Te Pāti Māori. Police confirmed they were already investigating complaints they had received. That same day, acting Public Service Commissioner Heather Baggott convened a meeting with the heads of the Statistics New Zealand, the Ministry of Health, Te Whatu Ora (Health New Zealand), the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Department of Internal Affairs, Te Puni Kōkiri (Ministry for Māori Development), Oranga Tamariki (Ministry for Children) and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the New Zealand Police and Electoral Commission to ensure that all relevant agencies were investigating the data breach allegations

On 10 June 2024, Prime Minister Luxon announced that the Public Service Commission would launch an independent inquiry into government agencies&#x27; safeguards for protecting people&#x27;s personal data and the circumstances surrounding the data breach allegations against Te Pāti Māori. The party was not notified of the Commission&#x27;s inquiry. Employment advocate Allan Hulse, who represented six former Manurewa Marae staff and the MSD employee, alleged that 1,400 census forms were photocopied and uploaded into a database owned by the Waiparera Trust. Hulse also alleged that staff used census data to help people transfer from the general to Māori roll. Tamihere has rejected these allegations, calling for people to produce &quot;hard evidence.&quot;

In early July 2024, former Māori academic Rawiri Taonui disputed the allegations against Te Pāti Māori, the Waipareira Trust and Manurewa Marae; arguing that photocopies of census data were taken solely for verification purposes and destroyed, highlighting that Statistics New Zealand had clarified that neither Tamihera, the Waipareira Trust and the Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency had access to their database, disputing that vouchers were used to encourage people to switch to the Māori electoral roll, and denying that Māori Party flyers were included in wellbeing packs. In late August 2024, Taonui claimed that the whistleblowers were connected to Destiny Church and had instigated the allegations against Manurewa Marae and Te Pāti Māori following a failed attempt by the church to take over the marae.

On 22 January 2025, a Statistics New Zealand report cleared the Whanau Ora Commissioning Agency of data breaches during the 2023 Census, finding that the agency increased Māori participation. The report made nine recommendations to improve Statistics NZ&#x27;s procedures and referred allegations against Manurewa Marae to the Privacy Commissioner. The report also found no evidence that one of the alleged whistleblowers had attempted to contact Statistics NZ regarding allegations against the marae.

On 11 February 2025, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Detective Superintendent Ross McKay was leading the inquiry into allegations regarding Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s misuse of census data and Covid-19 vaccination information at Manurewa Marae for electoral campaigning purposes.

== Principles and policy ==

The party is committed to advancing what it sees as the rights and interests of the Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. Increasingly since the beginning of colonisation, Māori have been marginalised and the group is now a minority within New Zealand alongside Pacific Islanders. Te Pāti Māori policy focuses particularly on affordable housing, Māori recruitment into tertiary institutes and a living wage for all workers, based on the premise that Māori are among the low-socioeconomic communities in New Zealand who are the most economically disadvantaged. During the 2020s, Te Pāti Māori has been widely described as progressive, and further to the political left than Labour by Al Jazeera and Newshub. (Previously, during its years in alliance with National, the party had been described as centrist.)

The Māori Party was formed in response to the 2004 foreshore and seabed controversy, a debate about whether Māori have legitimate claim to ownership of part or all of New Zealand&#x27;s foreshore and seabed. The founders of the party believed that:

* Māori owned the foreshore and seabed before British colonisation;
* made no specific mention of foreshore or seabed;
* No-one has subsequently purchased or otherwise acquired the foreshore or the seabed; and
* Māori should therefore still own the seabed and the foreshore today.

The (policy platform) of Te Pāti Māori is based on four principles or pillars:
* (includes policies regarding affordable housing, strengthening employment-support for Māori beneficiaries and te reo Māori)
* Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles (includes holding the Crown accountable to their obligations under , and policies on immigration)
* (includes policies on climate change in the Pacific and scholarships for Māori and Pasifika education to advance Māori and Pasifika as a collective)
* (includes policies on growing iwi economic resources and to protect freshwater as a )

These principles enable Te Pāti Māori to be held accountable for the maintenance and furthering of Māori concepts in the decision-making process. These concepts are not reflected in the traditional Westminster system and Māori customary law is excluded from the New Zealand general legal system.

Other Māori-rights-specific party policies have included the upholding of &quot;indigenous values&quot; and compulsory &quot;heritage studies&quot; in schools. In 2022 on Waitangi Day, the party called for Queen Elizabeth II to be removed as New Zealand&#x27;s head of state and for the return of land to iwi and hapū.

The party is also committed to a mixture of socially progressive and environmentalist policy through a &quot;Titiri-centric&quot; Māori lens. The party is committed to eradicating Goods and Services Tax on food, opposing deep sea drilling, organising and funding a Māori health authority and reducing homelessness in Māori communities.

=== Renaming New Zealand campaign ===

In September 2021 the party launched an online petition to:
* change the country&#x27;s official name to Aotearoa and
* officially restore Te Reo Māori names for all place names.

In its statement is mentioned Article 3 of the Treaty of Waitangi which gave the Māori language equal status with English. By 17 September 2021, 51,000 had signed the petition.

By early June 2022, a petition from Te Pāti Māori to rename New Zealand as &quot;Aotearoa&quot; had received over 70,000 signatures. On 2 June, the petition was submitted before Parliament&#x27;s petitions committee. Waititi argued that the proposed name change would recognise New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous heritage and strengthen its identity as a Pacific country. He opposed the idea of a referendum, claiming it would entrench the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;.

=== Foreign policy issues ===

In May 2021, Te Pāti Māori co-leaders Ngarewa-Packer and Waititi supported Green Member of Parliament Golriz Ghahraman&#x27;s push for New Zealand to recognise the State of Palestine.

During the Israel–Hamas war, Te Pāti Māori advocated the expulsion of the Israeli Ambassador, Ran Yaakoby if Israel did not implement a ceasefire or open a humanitarian corridor in Gaza. Co-leader Ngarewa Packer also defended Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick&#x27;s controversial &quot;From the river to the sea&quot; statement and urged the care-taker Labour Government to call for an &quot;end to war crimes.&quot;

==Electoral performance==
===House of Representatives===
== Leadership ==

, the constitution of Te Pāti Māori states that it must have two leaders, that its co-leaders must be drawn from its MPs first, and that one must be female and one male. These requirements have been in place since at least 2013.

The party&#x27;s first leaders were Tariana Turia and Pita Sharples. In December 2012, Turia announced she would resign as party co-leader before the 2014 general election. Te Ururoa Flavell announced his interest in a leadership role, but as the Māori Party constitution required male and female co-leaders, he could not take Turia&#x27;s place. Shortly after this, in July 2013, Sharples resigned as co-leader, saying he would quit politics altogether come the next general election in 2014. He went on to say that &quot;Our supporters deserve a unified party&quot; which indicated that the leadership tension influenced his decision to resign as party co-leader. Flavell replaced him as the party&#x27;s male co-leader. In the 2014 general election, Marama Fox became the party&#x27;s first list MP, and – as the party&#x27;s only female MP – under the party rules automatically became female co-leader.

Following Rawiri Waititi&#x27;s successful campaign for Waiariki at the 2020 New Zealand general election, he was confirmed as male co-leader, replacing John Tamihere, at a special general meeting of the Māori Party on 28 October.

The party also has a president:

<doc id="714163" wikidata="Q1302587" url="?curid=714163" title="Cross-correlation">
<text>In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two series as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other. This is also known as a &quot;sliding dot product&quot; or &quot;sliding inner-product&quot;. It is commonly used for searching a long signal for a shorter, known feature. It has applications in pattern recognition, single particle analysis, electron tomography, averaging, cryptanalysis, and neurophysiology. The cross-correlation is similar in nature to the convolution of two functions. In an autocorrelation, which is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, there will always be a peak at a lag of zero, and its size will be the signal energy.

In probability and statistics, the term &quot;cross-correlations&quot; refers to the correlations between the entries of two random vectors formula_1 and formula_2, while the &quot;correlations&quot; of a random vector formula_1 are the correlations between the entries of formula_1 itself, those forming the correlation matrix of formula_1. If each of formula_1 and formula_2 is a scalar random variable which is realized repeatedly in a time series, then the correlations of the various temporal instances of formula_1 are known as &quot;autocorrelations&quot; of formula_1, and the cross-correlations of formula_1 with formula_2 across time are temporal cross-correlations. In probability and statistics, the definition of correlation always includes a standardising factor in such a way that correlations have values between −1 and +1.

If formula_12 and formula_13 are two independent random variables with probability density functions formula_14 and formula_15, respectively, then the probability density of the difference formula_16 is formally given by the cross-correlation (in the signal-processing sense) formula_17; however, this terminology is not used in probability and statistics. In contrast, the convolution formula_18 (equivalent to the cross-correlation of formula_19 and formula_20) gives the probability density function of the sum formula_21.

==Cross-correlation of deterministic signals==
For continuous functions formula_14 and formula_15, the cross-correlation is defined as:formula_24which is equivalent toformula_25where formula_26 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_19, and formula_28 is called &quot;displacement&quot; or &quot;lag&quot;. 

For highly-correlated formula_14 and formula_15 which have a maximum cross-correlation at a particular formula_28, a feature in formula_14 at formula_33 also occurs later in formula_15 at formula_35, hence formula_15 could be described to &quot;lag&quot; formula_14 by formula_28.

If formula_14 and formula_15 are both continuous periodic functions of period formula_41, the integration from formula_42 to formula_43 is replaced by integration over any interval formula_44 of length formula_41:formula_46which is equivalent toformula_47Similarly, for discrete functions, the cross-correlation is defined as:formula_48which is equivalent to:formula_49For finite discrete functions formula_50, the (circular) cross-correlation is defined as:formula_51which is equivalent to:formula_52For finite discrete functions formula_53, formula_54, the kernel cross-correlation is defined as:formula_55where formula_56 is a vector of kernel functions formula_57 and formula_58 is an affine transform.

Specifically, formula_59 can be circular translation transform, rotation transform, or scale transform, etc. The kernel cross-correlation extends cross-correlation from linear space to kernel space. Cross-correlation is equivariant to translation; kernel cross-correlation is equivariant to any affine transforms, including translation, rotation, and scale, etc.

===Explanation===
As an example, consider two real valued functions formula_14 and formula_15 differing only by an unknown shift along the x-axis. One can use the cross-correlation to find how much formula_15 must be shifted along the x-axis to make it identical to formula_14. The formula essentially slides the formula_15 function along the x-axis, calculating the integral of their product at each position. When the functions match, the value of formula_65 is maximized. This is because when peaks (positive areas) are aligned, they make a large contribution to the integral. Similarly, when troughs (negative areas) align, they also make a positive contribution to the integral because the product of two negative numbers is positive.

With complex-valued functions formula_14 and formula_15, taking the conjugate of formula_14 ensures that aligned peaks (or aligned troughs) with imaginary components will contribute positively to the integral.

In econometrics, lagged cross-correlation is sometimes referred to as cross-autocorrelation.

===Properties===
 \cdot \mathcal{F}\left\{g\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where formula_69 denotes the Fourier transform, and an formula_70 again indicates the complex conjugate of formula_14, since formula_72. Coupled with fast Fourier transform algorithms, this property is often exploited for the efficient numerical computation of cross-correlations (see circular cross-correlation).
| The cross-correlation is related to the spectral density (see Wiener–Khinchin theorem).
| The cross-correlation of a convolution of formula_14 and formula_74 with a function formula_15 is the convolution of the cross-correlation of formula_15 and formula_14 with the kernel formula_74:
: formula_79.

==Cross-correlation of random vectors==
===Definition===
For random vectors formula_80 and formula_81, each containing random elements whose expected value and variance exist, the cross-correlation matrix of formula_1 and formula_2 is defined byformula_84and has dimensions formula_85. Written component-wise:formula_86The random vectors formula_1 and formula_2 need not have the same dimension, and either might be a scalar value.
Where formula_89 is the expectation value.

===Example===
For example, if formula_90 and formula_91 are random vectors, then formula_92 is a formula_93 matrix whose formula_94-th entry is formula_95.

===Definition for complex random vectors===
If formula_96 and formula_97 are complex random vectors, each containing random variables whose expected value and variance exist, the cross-correlation matrix of formula_98 and formula_99 is defined byformula_100where formula_101 denotes Hermitian transposition.

==Cross-correlation of stochastic processes==
In time series analysis and statistics, the cross-correlation of a pair of random process is the correlation between values of the processes at different times, as a function of the two times. Let formula_102 be a pair of random processes, and formula_33 be any point in time (formula_33 may be an integer for a discrete-time process or a real number for a continuous-time process). Then formula_105 is the value (or realization) produced by a given run of the process at time formula_33.

=== Cross-correlation function ===
Suppose that the process has means formula_107 and formula_108 and variances formula_109 and formula_110 at time formula_33, for each formula_33. Then the definition of the cross-correlation between times formula_113 and formula_114 isformula_115where formula_89 is the expected value operator. Note that this expression may be not defined.

=== Cross-covariance function ===
Subtracting the mean before multiplication yields the cross-covariance between times formula_113 and formula_114:formula_119Note that this expression is not well-defined for all time series or processes, because the mean or variance may not exist.

===Definition for wide-sense stationary stochastic process===
Let formula_102 represent a pair of stochastic processes that are jointly wide-sense stationary. Then the cross-covariance function and the cross-correlation function are given as follows.

====Cross-correlation function====
formula_121 or equivalently formula_122

==== Cross-covariance function====
formula_123 or equivalently formula_124where formula_125 and formula_126 are the mean and standard deviation of the process formula_127, which are constant over time due to stationarity; and similarly for formula_128, respectively. formula_129 indicates the expected value. That the cross-covariance and cross-correlation are independent of formula_33 is precisely the additional information (beyond being individually wide-sense stationary) conveyed by the requirement that formula_102 are &quot;jointly&quot; wide-sense stationary.

The cross-correlation of a pair of jointly wide sense stationary stochastic processes can be estimated by averaging the product of samples measured from one process and samples measured from the other (and its time shifts). The samples included in the average can be an arbitrary subset of all the samples in the signal (e.g., samples within a finite time window or a sub-sampling of one of the signals). For a large number of samples, the average converges to the true cross-correlation.

=== Normalization ===
It is common practice in some disciplines (e.g. statistics and time series analysis) to normalize the cross-correlation function to get a time-dependent Pearson correlation coefficient. However, in other disciplines (e.g. engineering) the normalization is usually dropped and the terms &quot;cross-correlation&quot; and &quot;cross-covariance&quot; are used interchangeably.

The definition of the normalized cross-correlation of a stochastic process isformula_132If the function formula_133 is well-defined, its value must lie in the range formula_134, with 1 indicating perfect correlation and −1 indicating perfect anti-correlation.

For jointly wide-sense stationary stochastic processes, the definition isformula_135The normalization is important both because the interpretation of the autocorrelation as a correlation provides a scale-free measure of the strength of statistical dependence, and because the normalization has an effect on the statistical properties of the estimated autocorrelations.

===Properties===
====Symmetry property====
For jointly wide-sense stationary stochastic processes, the cross-correlation function has the following symmetry property:formula_136Respectively for jointly WSS processes:formula_137
==Time delay analysis==
Cross-correlations are useful for determining the time delay between two signals, e.g., for determining time delays for the propagation of acoustic signals across a microphone array. After calculating the cross-correlation between the two signals, the maximum (or minimum if the signals are negatively correlated) of the cross-correlation function indicates the point in time where the signals are best aligned; i.e., the time delay between the two signals is determined by the argument of the maximum, or arg max of the cross-correlation, as informula_138Terminology in image processing
===Zero-normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC)===

For image-processing applications in which the brightness of the image and template can vary due to lighting and exposure conditions, the images can be first normalized. This is typically done at every step by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. That is, the cross-correlation of a template formula_139 with a subimage formula_140 is

formula_141

where formula_142 is the number of pixels in formula_139 and formula_140,
formula_145 is the average of formula_14 and formula_147 is standard deviation of formula_14.

In functional analysis terms, this can be thought of as the dot product of two normalized vectors. That is, ifformula_149andformula_150then the above sum is equal toformula_151where formula_152 is the inner product and formula_153 is the &quot;L&quot;² norm. Cauchy–Schwarz then implies that ZNCC has a range of formula_154.

Thus, if formula_14 and formula_33 are real matrices, their normalized cross-correlation equals the cosine of the angle between the unit vectors formula_157 and formula_41, being thus formula_159 if and only if formula_157 equals formula_41 multiplied by a positive scalar.

Normalized correlation is one of the methods used for template matching, a process used for finding instances of a pattern or object within an image. It is also the 2-dimensional version of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.

===Normalized cross-correlation (NCC)===
NCC is similar to ZNCC with the only difference of not subtracting the local mean value of intensities:formula_162

== Nonlinear systems ==
Caution must be applied when using cross correlation function which assumes Gaussian variance for nonlinear systems. In certain circumstances, which depend on the properties of the input, cross correlation between the input and output of a system with nonlinear dynamics can be completely blind to certain nonlinear effects. This problem arises because some quadratic moments can equal zero and this can incorrectly suggest that there is little &quot;correlation&quot; (in the sense of statistical dependence) between two signals, when in fact the two signals are strongly related by nonlinear dynamics.

<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, England, an official football tournament between national representative selections was contested for the first time; football had been played between club teams at the Games of 1900 and 1904. 

There were eight entries, including two from France (the main team and a B team). Hungary and Bohemia both withdrew after the draw and appointment of referees, leaving six teams to contest the tournament.

Great Britain won the gold medal representing the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Ireland), although all the players were from England.

Sophus &quot;Krølben&quot; Nielsen of Denmark set a record by scoring 10 goals in a 17–1 win over France A. The famous mathematician Harald Bohr, brother of the even more famous Niels Bohr, also played for Denmark, who won the silver medal.

With eight entries, the tournament draw had a full quarterfinal round of four matches.

However, after the draw and appointment of referees, (on 12 October) and (on 14 October) were both forced to withdraw due to financial reasons: their opponents, the Netherlands and France respectively, were awarded a 2–0 victory.

===First round===





===Semi-finals===


===Bronze medal match===
Originally, all six teams eliminated before the final were to participate in a consolation tournament for the bronze medal, with two first-round matches to be played on 21 October between the four quarter-final losers. 

After Hungary and Bohemia both withdrew, the first round was scratched on 15 October, with France B and Sweden qualifying for the semi-finals of the consolation tournament.

France B, Sweden and the two semi-final losers, France and the Netherlands, were scheduled to play the semi-finals on 23 October: the French teams were drawn against each other, and the Netherlands were drawn against Sweden, with the winners playing off in the bronze medal match prior to the gold medal match on 24 October.

However, both French teams had returned home immediately after their crushing defeats to Denmark on 19 October and 22 October: therefore, their semi-final and the 24 October bronze medal match were both scratched, with the Netherlands v Sweden semi-final becoming the bronze medal match.

<text>In computing, a named pipe (also known as a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] for its behavior) is an extension to the traditional pipe concept on Unix and Unix-like systems, and is one of the methods of inter-process communication (IPC). The concept is also found in OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, although the semantics differ substantially. A traditional pipe is &quot;unnamed&quot; and lasts only as long as the process. A named pipe, however, can last as long as the system is up, beyond the life of the process. It can be deleted if no longer used. Usually a named pipe appears as a file, and generally processes attach to it for IPC.

== In Unix ==
Instead of a conventional, unnamed, shell pipeline, a named pipeline makes use of the filesystem. It is explicitly created using codice_1 or codice_2, and two separate processes can access the pipe by name — one process can open it as a reader, and the other as a writer.

For example, one can create a pipe and set up gzip to compress things piped to it:

mkfifo my_pipe
gzip -9 -c &lt; my_pipe &gt; out.gz &amp;

In a separate process shell, independently, one could send the data to be compressed:
 cat file &gt; my_pipe
The named pipe can be deleted just like any file:
 rm my_pipe

A named pipe can be used to transfer information from one application to another without the use of an intermediate temporary file. For example, you can pipe the output of gzip into a named pipe like so (here out.gz is from above example but it can be any gz):

mkfifo -m 0666 /tmp/namedPipe
gzip -d &lt; out.gz &gt; /tmp/namedPipe
Then load the uncompressed data into a MySQL table like so:

LOAD DATA INFILE &#x27;/tmp/namedPipe&#x27; INTO TABLE tableName;
Without this named pipe one would need to write out the entire uncompressed version of file.gz before loading it into MySQL. Writing the temporary file is both time-consuming and results in more I/O and less free space on the hard drive.

PostgreSQL&#x27;s command line utility, codice_3, also supports loading data from named pipes.

== In Windows ==

A named pipe can be accessed much like a file. Win32 SDK functions codice_4, codice_5, codice_6 and codice_7 open, read from, write to, and close a pipe, respectively. Unlike Unix, there is no command line interface, except for PowerShell.

Named pipes cannot be created as files within a normal filesystem, unlike in Unix. Also unlike their Unix counterparts, named pipes are volatile (removed after the last reference to them is closed). Every pipe is placed in the root directory of the named pipe filesystem (NPFS), mounted under the special path codice_8 (that is, a pipe named &quot;foo&quot; would have a full path name of codice_9). Anonymous pipes used in pipelining are actually named pipes with a random name.

They are very rarely seen by users, but there are notable exceptions. The VMware Workstation PC hardware virtualization tool, for instance, can expose emulated serial ports to the host system as named pipes, and the WinDbg kernel mode debugger from Microsoft supports named pipes as a transport for debugging sessions (in fact, VMware and WinDbg can be coupled together – as WinDbg normally requires a serial connection to the target computer – letting driver developers do their development and testing on a single computer). Both programs require the user to enter names in the codice_10 form.

Windows NT named pipes can inherit a security context.

Summary of named pipes on Microsoft Windows:
* Intermachine and intramachine IPC
* Half-duplex or full-duplex
* Byte-oriented or packet-oriented
* Reliable
* Connection-oriented communication
* Blocking or Nonblocking read and write (choosable)
* Standard device I/O handles (codice_5, codice_6)
* Namespace used to create handles
* Inefficient WAN traffic (explicit data transfer request, unlike e.g. TCP/IP sliding window, etc.)
* Peekable reads (read without removing from pipe&#x27;s input buffer)

The .NET Framework 3.5 has added named pipe support.

Named pipes can also be used as an endpoint in Microsoft SQL Server.

Named pipes are also a networking protocol in the Server Message Block (SMB) suite, based on the use of a special inter-process communication (IPC) share. SMB&#x27;s IPC can seamlessly and transparently pass the authentication context of the user across to Named Pipes. Windows NT&#x27;s entire NT Domain protocol suite of services are implemented as DCE/RPC service over Named Pipes, as are the Exchange 5.5 Administrative applications.

<doc id="714174" wikidata="Q960008" url="?curid=714174" title="The Yellow and Black Attack">
<text>The Yellow and Black Attack is the debut EP by American Christian metal band Stryper. It was originally released in 1984 as a six-song EP, and fewer than 20,000 copies were pressed, as their label, Enigma Records, was unsure of the potential market for Christian metal. &quot;CCM Magazine&quot; was slightly critical, citing production quality and the short length of the release, but commented that &quot;Stryper has the promise of a major success story.&quot; According to Michael Sweet&#x27;s autobiography, the album was re-recorded and released as an official album, after their first manager, Daryn Hinton, loaned them $100,000 to re-produce the record. The album initially sold 150,000 units in the first three weeks.

After Stryper achieved major success with their second release and first full-length album, &quot;Soldiers Under Command&quot;, &quot;The Yellow and Black Attack&quot; EP was reissued. Re-released on August 10, 1986 with two additional songs, &quot;Reason for the Season&quot; (which was originally released on a 1985 Christmas-themed 12&quot; single with &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;) and a new, mellowed-down version of &quot;My Love I&#x27;ll Always Show&quot;, which dates from their Roxx Regime days. The version recorded for &quot;The Yellow and Black Attack&quot; featured less obvious Christian lyrics than the one to feature on &quot;The Roxx Regime Demos&quot;.

<text>Mathieu Biron (born April 29, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played over 250 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). After retiring as a hockey player, he became a firefighter.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Biron played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Charlesbourg, Quebec City. He was drafted by the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Los Angeles Kings in the first round (twenty-first overall) of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft.

New York Islanders traded Žigmund Pálffy, Bryan Smolinski, Marcel Cousineau and 4th round selection (previously acquired from the New Jersey Devils - Daniel Johansson) in 1999 to the Los Angeles Kings for Olli Jokinen, Josh Green, Mathieu Biron and 1st round selection (Taylor Pyatt) in 1999.

On November 24, 2003, Biron became the first NHL player in 23 years to score a goal against his brother when he finished a 2-on-1 against older brother Martin, in a victory over the Buffalo Sabres.

Biron was traded to the Canadiens on December 15, 2006 via a trade with the San Jose Sharks for Patrick Traverse.

His last season in the NHL came in 2005-06, when he made 52 appearances for the Washington Capitals. He then spent two years in the AHL, playing for the Worcester Sharks and Hamilton Bulldogs.

Biron signed with the Frankfurt Lions of the German top-flight Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) for the 2008-09 season and moved to fellow DEL team Hamburg Freezers for the 2009-10 campaign.

From 2010 to 2012 he turned out to conclude his playing career for Thetford Mines Isothermic in the LNAH.

==Personal==
His older brother Martin Biron is a former goaltender who played 16 seasons in the NHL.

After his hockey career, Biron trained and studied to become a firefighter in Lévis, Quebec.

<doc id="714179" wikidata="Q3358681" url="?curid=714179" title="Outsiders (comics)">
<text>The Outsiders are a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. As their name suggests, the team consists of superheroes who do not fit the norms of the &quot;mainstream&quot; superhero community, i.e. the Justice League.

The Outsiders have had a number of different incarnations. They were founded by Batman, whose ties to the Justice League were strained at the time, and introduced the original line-up of Batman, Black Lightning, Metamorpho, Geo-Force, Katana, Halo and Looker. A later incarnation of the Outsiders from the early 2000s comics was led by Nightwing and Arsenal following the dissolution of the Teen Titans superhero group, and depicted the team as a group hunting for super-criminals. For the team&#x27;s third incarnation, Batman reforms them as a special strike team featuring classic members Katana and Metamorpho alongside new recruits such as Catwoman and Black Lightning&#x27;s daughter Thunder. After the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; storyline, Alfred Pennyworth acts on Batman&#x27;s instructions to reassemble the team once more, recruiting new members and more of the team&#x27;s original lineup.

Another version of the team with a familiar line-up briefly featured in &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot; in 2011 as the black ops section of Batman&#x27;s organization. Later, the Outsiders are rebooted as a secret society of weapons themed-characters in the pages of &quot;Green Arrow&quot;, featuring Katana and Onyx alongside several new characters, before the original Outsiders are brought back in 2017, following &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; as a strike team founded by Batman. 2020s incarnations of the team are led by Black Lightning, Batwing, and Batwoman, and add The Signal to the lineup.

A version of the team appears in the live action series &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, fully formed starting in the third season and led by Black Lightning.

==Fictional history==
===&quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; / &quot;The Adventures of the Outsiders&quot; (1983–1987)===
The Outsiders first appeared in a special insert in the final issue (#200) of &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; in 1983. The team was given its own comic, &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;, which debuted in August 1983. It was created and originally written by Mike W. Barr and illustrated by Jim Aparo (later illustrated by Alan Davis).

After Batman left the group in issue #32, the title was changed to &quot;The Adventures of the Outsiders&quot;, continuing until its cancellation with issue #46. Issue #38 featured the last original story in the series, as issues #39-46 were reprints of stories from the companion series &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1985).

The cast of the Outsiders was notable for having mostly new characters (Geo-Force, Katana, Halo and Looker). The other members were two characters who refused membership in the Justice League (Black Lightning and Metamorpho) and former Leaguer Batman.

====Markovia and Baron Bedlam====
The Outsiders formed in the fictional East European country of Markovia, which was ravaged by war at the time. Batman had attempted to enlist the Justice League of America&#x27;s aid, but was told they had been ordered to stay out of the conflict. Because he disagreed with the order, Batman resigned to strike out on his own. He and Black Lightning traveled to Markovia to free captive Lucius Fox from Baron Bedlam who killed the country&#x27;s ruler King Viktor. One of the king&#x27;s sons became Geo-Force after gaining powers from Markovia&#x27;s top scientist Dr. Helga Jace to stop Bedlam. Metamorpho was searching for Dr. Jace for the doctor to help him with his powers. Katana arrived in Markovia to kill General Karnz (Bedlam&#x27;s military commander) as vengeance for her family&#x27;s death. Batman found a young, amnesiac girl in the woods exhibiting light-based powers whom he names Halo who was an Aurakle that possessed the body of Violet Harper after she was killed by Syonide. These heroes banded together to defeat Baron Bedlam and decided to stay together as a team, later fighting such villains as Agent Orange, the Fearsome Five and the Cryonic Man.

====The Masters of Disaster and the Force of July====
Recurring foes include the Masters of Disaster (New Wave, Shakedown, Windfall, Heatstroke, and Coldsnap), who at one point were almost able to kill Black Lightning. Windfall eventually became disenchanted with her team and joined the Outsiders. Another recurring opponent was the Force of July, a group of patriotic metahumans who also regularly came into contact with the Suicide Squad. During this time, Geo-Force&#x27;s half-sister Terra died as a traitor against the Teen Titans. Batman revealed his real identity as Bruce Wayne to the team (although they already knew it). Eventually, Halo&#x27;s origins were revealed. Emily Briggs (who later became the superheroine Looker and joined the team) was introduced. Denise Howard (the love interest of Geo-Force) appeared for the second time.

====Without Batman====
Baron Bedlam later returned to life. With the assistance of the Bad Samaritan, the Masters of Disaster and Soviet forces, he again tried to seize control of Markovia. Batman withheld this information, angering the rest of the team. This eventually led to Batman disbanding the team and returning to the Justice League of America. Nevertheless, the team traveled to Markovia, discovering many Markovian military casualties. They were defeated by the Masters and learn that Bedlam cloned Adolf Hitler; however, the Hitler clone committed suicide in horror of the atrocities perpetrated by the original. The Outsiders became unofficial agents of Markovia to receive Markovian funding. They moved to Los Angeles; Geo-Force left his girlfriend Denise behind and Looker separated from her husband.

===&quot;Outsiders&quot; (1985–1988)===
This series again featured the original group, and was printed in the Baxter paper format used on such titles as &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 2) and the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; (vol. 3). It lasted for 28 issues, in addition to &quot;Annual&quot;s and special issues. The series originally ran alongside the title &quot;The Adventures of the Outsiders&quot;, chronicling events a year after that series. In the end, the first few issues of this series were reprinted in &quot;The Adventures of the Outsiders&quot; before that title was cancelled.

====Story====
The team moves into a new headquarters in Los Angeles and once again becomes involved in an adventure with the Force of July (ending in Moscow). Villains such as the Duke of Oil and the Soviet super-team the People&#x27;s Heroes are introduced during this time. The team&#x27;s adventures take them all over the globe, most notably when the Outsiders&#x27; plane is shot down and the team is marooned on a deserted island for three weeks. Tensions rise as Geo-Force tries to resign his leadership and he and Looker succumb to temptation. Eventually, the team is rescued.

More trouble arises when a detective is hired to look into Looker (now working as a model known as Lia Briggs) and her private life, and learns of her actual identity as Emily. The detective tries to blackmail her, but she hypnotizes him and forces him to leave. However, he is killed shortly afterward and Looker is arrested as a suspect. The Outsiders, fortunately, clear her name.

====Reuniting with Batman====
The Outsiders are reunited with Batman when they band together to fight Eclipso. After the adventure, Batman gives them access to a batcave in Los Angeles. The team is also infiltrated by a clone of Windfall. Meanwhile, Looker and Geo-Force feel guilty about their affair and eventually end it. Metamorpho faces his own personal problems with his wife Sapphire Stagg-Mason. The clone of Windfall is ultimately killed; the Masters of Disaster are defeated, as the real Windfall joins the Outsiders. The team also meets the other Los Angeles-based team Infinity, Inc.

===&quot;Millennium&quot;===

The team is next involved with the crossover event &quot;Millennium&quot;, wherein it is revealed that Dr. Jace is an operative of the villainous Manhunters and kidnaps the team. The team (now joined by the Atomic Knight) free themselves, but Dr. Jace blows up herself and Metamorpho. Looker is called to return to Abyssia (the origin of her powers), where she must also face the Manhunters. During the adventure, she is drained of much of her power and returns to her normal form. Halo is hit in the crossfire when saving Katana&#x27;s life, and slips into a coma as Katana vows to look after her. The team is disbanded by Geo-Force as Looker returns to her husband, and Batman rejoins the Justice League.

===&quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 2) (1993–1995)===
This revival of the title in 1993 lasted 25 issues and was written by Mike W. Barr, with most issues penciled by Paul Pelletier.

====Story====
Declared a traitor in his native Markovia, Geo-Force is forced to seek the help of old (and new) Outsiders to battle the vampire-lord who controls his country. This is later coupled with the framing of the Outsiders for the slaughter of a Markovian village, forcing them into hiding. This fugitive status motivates the Atomic Knight to go after them, hoping to bring in his former allies without too much trouble. He is eventually convinced of their innocence and joins them.
The new members who join the team in Markovia are the magician Sebastian Faust, the warsuit-wearing engineer and industrialist the Technocrat and Wylde, a friend of Technocrat who Faust fuses with a bear to save his life.

During the initial confrontation with the vampires, Looker is apparently killed. Hiding out in Gotham City, the Outsiders experience another loss as the Technocrat&#x27;s wife Marissa and Halo are killed during a fight with Jean-Paul Valley. However, Halo&#x27;s spirit survives in Marissa&#x27;s body. For some time afterward, the Technocrat has trouble accepting that his wife is dead. Eventually it is discovered that Looker is not dead, but undead. The Outsiders find her and free her from the vampire&#x27;s control.

====Split in two====
After the defeat of the vampires, two teams (one composed of Geo-Force, Katana, and Technocrat; the other composed of Eradicator, Looker, Wylde, Halo, and Sebastian Faust) claim the name of the Outsiders; both teams are considered fugitives due to questionable tactics by their new members. During this time, the teams learn that Halo&#x27;s original body was resurrected by Kobra and joined their ranks. Both Kobra and Violet Harper are defeated, and Windfall rejoins the Outsiders.

The two teams unite to confront Felix Faust, the father of Outsiders member Sebastian Faust. During the confrontation, Wylde betrays the team when Felix promises to restore his humanity. The team defeats Felix and Wylde, who is transformed into a normal bear and kept in a zoo where Looker can regularly visit him. The title ends with the clearing of the Outsiders&#x27; names and the marriage of Geo-Force and Denise Howard.

In the interim, the Halo entity is restored to Violet Harper&#x27;s body, returning her to normal off-panel and a new team of Outsiders is formed and seen as active in the &quot;Day of Judgment&quot; crossover event. Members of this new team include Geo-Force, Halo, Katana, and Terra II, who in the 1999 &quot;Titans Secret Files&quot; series, left the team after a round of genetic tests performed by scientists failed to decipher Terra&#x27;s DNA to tell who she was prior to being turned into a genetic doppelgänger of the original Terra.

===&quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) (2003–2007)===

&quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) is largely unrelated to the previous series. It was launched in 2003 with new members, some of whom had been part of the Titans. The series was cancelled with issue #50 and relaunched as &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; (vol. 2), featuring a mix of current and new members.

====Formation====
The new team is put together following the &quot;Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day&quot; crossover, which dissolves both groups. Arsenal accepts a sponsorship offer from the Optitron Corporation and uses the money to buy an enormous bomb shelter which had belonged to a multimillionaire, renovating it as group headquarters. He recruits a group of young heroes, the last of whom is his friend Nightwing. Nightwing decides that, instead of functioning in a reactive capacity like most other superhero teams, this group should act as hunters, tracking down supervillains before they can cause problems.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;===

Technocrat and Looker are near Breach when he explodes during the Battle of Metropolis. The fate of Technocrat remains unclear, while Looker soon appears in an issue of &quot;World War III&quot;. Roy Harper is saved by Superman from Doomsday, and Captain Marvel Jr. was sent to Earth-S when it was reformed. When New Earth came into existence, he went with other heroes who could fly to fight Superboy-Prime. In the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; hardcover, Freddy joined alongside the other Titans to take down the members of the Secret Society of Super Villains who tried to kill Robin.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===

After &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the Outsiders are &quot;officially&quot; no more. Because of the Freedom of Power Treaty, the Outsiders have been operating covertly outside of the United States. Most of the members were presumed dead until a botched mission forced them to reveal their presence. Following the revelation of their existence, they are recruited by Checkmate to pursue missions which Checkmate cannot support publicly. Checkmate&#x27;s assignment as part of the &quot;CheckOut&quot; crossover story arc involves dispatching the Outsiders to Oolong Island in China, the scene of World War III the previous year. The mission goes disastrously wrong when Chang Tzu captures Owen Mercer and Checkmate&#x27;s Black Queen, until both sides are bailed out by Batman. In the aftermath, Nightwing decides to give Batman control of the team once more.

===&quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; (vol. 2) / &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 4) (2007–2011)===

In November 2007, writer Chuck Dixon and artist Julian Lopez relaunched &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3) as &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; (vol. 2), with the Dark Knight taking control of the team in the aftermath of the &quot;CheckOut&quot; crossover with Checkmate.

====&quot;Outsiders: Five of a Kind&quot;====
In the weeks leading up to the new series&#x27; debut, Batman holds tryouts to determine who will be on the team in a series of one-shots called &quot;Five of a Kind&quot;. Each issue featured a different creative team (including Outsiders creator Mike W. Barr) and an epilogue written by Tony Bedard.

Batman angers several members, who feel he has no right to remove people already on the team. Captain Boomerang leaves the team for Amanda Waller&#x27;s Suicide Squad, and Nightwing decides to take no part in the Outsiders&#x27; questionable activities. Katana is chosen as the team&#x27;s first official member, joined later by the Martian Manhunter, Metamorpho and Grace. Thunder is kicked off the team; the second Aquaman is rejected because Batman feels he does not match up to his predecessor, Orin. Batman then tells the other members: &quot;Whether you like it or not, you&#x27;re here to save the world. And you&#x27;re going to be &quot;hated&quot; for it&quot;. After the team&#x27;s first official mission in &quot;Outsiders&quot; #50, Catwoman overheard the other recruits talking about the team being &quot;down by law&quot; and said: &quot;Batman can&#x27;t possibly start up his own crew of super-crooks without &quot;me&quot; in it!&quot;

====&quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; (vol. 2)====
The team from &quot;Outsiders&quot; #50 was featured in the first two issues of &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; (vol. 2). Afterward, Catwoman and the Martian Manhunter left the team and Batgirl, Geo-Force and the Green Arrow joined; Thunder consistently appeared in the series as well. In issue #5, Ralph &quot;the Elongated Man&quot; and Sue Dibny make a guest appearance. They are now &quot;ghost detectives&quot;, and seem able to possess people in a method similar to that of Deadman. Dr. Francine Langstrom (wife of Dr. Kirk Langstrom, a.k.a. the Man-Bat) serves as the team&#x27;s technical advisor, and her assistant Salah Miandad operates the &quot;blank&quot; OMAC drone known as ReMAC. In issue #9, Batman calls on former team member Looker to assist in an interrogation.

The first main storyline of the title involves Batman sending the team to investigate the mysterious Mr. Jardine, who is organizing a convoluted plot to populate a subterranean lake on the Moon with alien lifeforms. While trying to stop Jardine&#x27;s unauthorized space-shot in South America, Metamorpho is blasted into space and is forced to escape from the International Space Station, where seemingly-brainwashed astronauts are building a giant weapon. Seeking a shuttle to hijack, the rest of the team infiltrates a Chinese space facility, only to be captured by members of the Great Ten. The timely intervention of Batgirl and ReMAC saves the team from execution. Metamorpho steals a shuttle back to Earth, escapes from the European Space Agency and rejoins the team.

During the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; events, an assembly of the Outsiders (including Thunder) receives a message from the missing Batman. It asks them to feed a secret code into the cybernetic mind of ReMAC, allowing it to track the Caped Crusader and the Black Glove organization and help him in his fight. As they comply (against Batgirl&#x27;s advice), the code reveals itself as a cybernetic booby-trap coming from Simon Hurt (the mastermind behind Batman&#x27;s downfall) and ReMAC explodes. Several Outsiders are wounded, and Thunder suffers brain injuries severe enough to knock her into a seemingly-irreversible coma. However, her in-costume appearance in the &quot;Final Crisis: Submit&quot; story contradicts this; the events of that &quot;Final Crisis&quot; storyline occur after the events in &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot;, suggesting a continuity error. When Black Lightning rejoins the team after the events of &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, he is shown visiting Thunder (who is still hospitalized in a coma).

====&quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 4)====
As a result of &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot; (where Batman apparently died), the series was renamed &quot;Outsiders&quot; (vol. 4) and featured a new team roster. The change occurred when a new creative team took over, with Peter Tomasi writing and Lee Garbett on art duty. Tomasi began with &quot;Batman and the Outsiders Special&quot; (vol. 2) #1 and the retitled series began with issue #15.

One night, after going to visit the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne, Alfred awakens in Wayne Manor to a giant door opening in his room. He walks through it, where he sees a pod with a chair inside. He takes a seat, as a hologram of Batman activates. Batman explains that, because he has not entered a special code into the Bat-Computer (or any of its subsidiaries) for a certain length of time, this recording is playing (meaning he is probably dead). He tells Alfred of a very important mission the latter must undertake on his behalf (since Batman is unable to do so), but gives him a choice to accept or decline. Alfred promptly accepts; Batman explains what Alfred has meant to him throughout his life, saying to him what he did not have a chance to say at his death: &quot;Goodbye, Dad.&quot;

With this, Batman charges Alfred to assemble a new team of Outsiders. Alfred travels around the planet, recruiting Roy Raymond Jr., Black Lightning, Geo-Force (leader), Halo, Katana, the Creeper and Metamorpho. As a member of the team, each must become a true &quot;outsider,&quot; living away from their families and the public eye for months at a time. Each member fills a role once filled by Batman, making this team a composite. This story arc ended with issue #25, and the series ended after 40 issues.

===Post–&quot;Final Crisis&quot;===
Dan DiDio and Phillip Tan began a new run of &quot;Outsiders&quot; in January 2010, in which Geo-Force appears to be acting more irrationally since his battle with Deathstroke. Without consulting the rest of the team (or Alfred), Geo-Force enters into a non-aggression pact with New Krypton, offering Markovia as a haven for all Kryptonians. The Eradicator is New Krypton&#x27;s representative.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe.

====&quot;Batman Inc.&quot; (2011–2013)====
In he pages of the 2011 &quot;Batman Inc.&quot; series by Grant Morrison, Batman assembles a new team of Outsiders which acts as a black-ops wing of Batman Incorporated. The team consists of Metamorpho, Katana, Looker, Halo and Freight Train, and is led by the Red Robin. This incarnation of the team proved short-lived, as all of its members (except the Red Robin) were caught in an explosion caused by Lord Death Man in the 2011 &quot;Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes&quot; one-shot issue. The survivors were revealed in issue #1 of (vol. two) (2012). Metamorpho had kept everyone alive via his powers.

====In &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 5) (2013–2016)====
Beginning with Jeff Lemire&#x27;s run of &quot;Green Arrow&quot; (vol. 5), a new version of the &#x27;Outsiders&#x27; was introduced. This is explained as being an ancient secret society dedicated to the elimination of corruption, but which itself has grown corrupt. Its membership is formed from the leaders of various clans centred around totemic weapons: the Mask, the Fist, the Arrow, the Axe, the Spear, the Shield, the Sword. A literal Green Arrow was the totemic weapon of the &#x27;Arrow Clan&#x27;, but this was destroyed by the Green Arrow as part of his symbolic rejection of the group. The Soultaker sword owned by Katana is the Sword Totem, making her the leader of the Sword Clan. The weapon totems supposedly grant immortality and enlightenment on the wielder, but the Green Arrow doubts such claims.

The leader of the Arrow Clan was once Robert Queen, Green Arrow&#x27;s father. With his apparent death, it passed to Komodo, an evil archer. It would later be passed to Shado, Robert Queen&#x27;s former lover and another master archer. Katana heads the Sword Clan. An unkillable shapeshifter named Magus heads the Mask Clan. A physically intimidating man known as the Butcher leads the Axe Clan. Golgotha, leader of the Spear Clan, for a time led the Outsiders overall. Onyx leads the Fist Clan. The Shield Clan is led by Kodiak, who in addition to his mastery of the shield, wears a terrifying skull mask.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
The original Outsiders are reintroduced in &quot;Dark Days: The Forge&quot; #1 (2017), a prelude to DC&#x27;s &quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot; crossover, in an expository scene which explains that Batman formed the Outsiders (Black Lightning, Metamorpho, Geo-Force, Katana, and Halo) to investigate a mystery concerning the DC Universe which connects the strangeness of the Multiverse to the amazing properties of metals—like Nth metal, the Court of Owls&#x27; resurrection metal, Aquaman&#x27;s trident, and Doctor Fate&#x27;s helmet— to metahumans and to mystical lands like Nanda Parbat, Skartaris, Atlantis, and Themiscyra. He assembled the team to operate outside the knowledge of the government, the Justice League, or the Batman family.

In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Geo-Force forms a new version of the Outsiders consisting of Baroness Bedlam, Eradicator, Knightfall, Terra, and Wylde.

The &quot;Detective Comics&quot; story arc &quot;On the Outside&quot; (July 2018) had Batman and Black Lightning come together to defeat the villain Karma. In the aftermath of the battle, Batman told Black Lightning that he wanted him to lead a new team of Outsiders consisting of himself, Cassandra Cain, Duke Thomas, and Katana, who had fought as their allies in the fight against Karma. An ongoing comic book featuring this team, titled &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot; (vol. 3), was set to release in December 2018. The series was abruptly cancelled before finally releasing in May the following year.

Later, Black Lightning assembles a new &quot;modular&quot; iteration of the team with himself, Duke, Katana, and Metamorpho, and a rotating fifth member. In &quot;Batman: Urban Legends&quot;, Batman joins the team to help Duke find his mother.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="714183" wikidata="Q17001703" url="?curid=714183" title="Christian Science Hymnal">
<text>The Christian Science Hymnal is a collection of hymns used in Christian Science church services including Sunday services and Wednesday evening testimony meetings, as well as in occasional informal hymn sings. 

==Content==
The &quot;Christian Science Hymnal&quot; includes both traditional Christian hymns and hymns unique to the Christian Science hymnal. The hymnal includes tunes from a variety of styles and nationalities. It gives metronomic markings to help musicians, but never a fixed tempo, so that the musicians may find the appropriate speed for the building, congregation, or situation themselves.

The hymnal includes seven poems by the denomination&#x27;s founder Mary Baker Eddy set to various tunes: &quot;Christ My Refuge&quot;, &quot;Christmas Morn&quot;, &quot;Communion Hymn&quot;, &quot;Feed My Sheep&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Evening Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Satisfied&quot;. The hymnal also includes hymns written by John Greenleaf Whittier, Isaac Watts, Samuel Longfellow, and many others. A 2017 supplement added modern hymn and tune authors, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

==History==
At the beginning of the Christian Science movement, congregants used other Christian hymnals, but in 1890 the Publishing Society printed a 17 hymn words-only booklet, which was followed two years later in 1892 by the first formal &quot;Christian Science Hymnal&quot;.

The hymnal contained 210 hymns, and generally presented two hymns on a single page, in their poetic form, in conjunction with two or three tunes to which either could be sung. Hymns 179-193 were presented individually, interlined with their respective tunes. Organist and music editor for the hymnal Lyman F. Brackett (1852-1937) contributed 99 of the book&#x27;s tunes. The layout of the book is described in the Preface:
:&quot;The system of arrangement is original and unique. On the pages with the hymns, have been placed standard tunes familiar to every church-goer. Every second tune is by an English or German composer of unquestioned musical ability, and will be found adapted either to chorus-choir, or advanced congregational singing. Every third tune has been composed by Mr. Brackett especially for this work;...&quot;

After 1892, the hymnal was revised in 1898, 1903, and 1910. The revised hymnals presented the hymns interlined with their tunes for easier reading, as is common practice in America today. Eddy was not closely involved in the 1910 revision of the hymnal, but had input on a few hymns, for instance approving a tune for her poem &quot;Mother&#x27;s Evening Prayer&quot;.

===1932 edition===
In 1928, the Christian Science Board of Directors appointed initial committees in London and Boston to create another revision, which was published in 1932. Violet S. Hay was involved in this process as the chairman of the London committee, and seven of her hymns appear in the final product.

The hymns in the 1932 edition were primarily alphabetical by first line, some with alternate tune settings, and include information on the author, tune composer, meter, and use by permission. There were 429 hymns/tunes: 297 hymns were presented with different tune settings (241 appeared in the 1910 edition). Alternate tunes setting the same hymn were presented in numerical succession in the main body of the book (a change from the 1910 edition). The final 29 entries were in the Supplement section which was present in the original printing of the 1932 book: 
:&quot;In a few cases the familiar arrangement of a tune has been placed in the Supplement, and a new arrangement in the body of the book... The Supplement, which is serially numbered though not alphabetically arranged, includes also hymns and tunes which are more or less locally or nationally rather than internationally serviceable.&quot;

Settings of two of Eddy&#x27;s poems, &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Satisfied&quot;, first appeared with the 1932 edition. More numerous alternate settings of the seven hymns by Eddy were provided, as they are chosen often for use in worship services. Index listings include tunes alphabetically, tunes metrically, composers and sources, tempo indications, authors and sources, and first lines. Found in the Supplement section are the hymns, &quot;I Need Thee Every Hour&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Pilgrim and I&#x27;m a Stranger&quot;, and &quot;Eternity&quot;, which were originally included in the hymnal at the request of Eddy.

The 1932 version became the standard through the present day, typically in first blue, then brown cover, with an octagonal emboss of the Original Mother Church tower and Extension dome. It has been translated into numerous languages; the tunes and hymn numbers are maintained, joined to the vernacular versions of the texts. Visitors would be able to sing in their own language, joining with the congregation singing in the other language.

===New supplements and editions===
During the early 1980s, exploratory work was undertaken into a third edition, with many new tunes and texts planned for inclusion, but the project was shelved in 1988. In late 2008, a new supplement containing 33 additional hymns/tunes was published in booklet form.

In 2017, The Church published &quot;Christian Science Hymnal: Hymns 430–603&quot;. This hymnal complements the 1932 edition, and includes contemporary and traditional hymns, and hymns from around the world. The 2017 edition consists of 174 hymns, including 30 from the 2008 Supplement and 17 new settings of poems by Mary Baker Eddy.

<text>Daniel Clark Blackburn (born May 20, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played 63 regular-season games for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL), going 20–32–11 with 1 shutout.

==Minor league career==
Born in Quebec, Blackburn moved to Canmore, Alberta as a teen and played major junior hockey with the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Kootenay Ice in Cranbrook, British Columbia. In 2001, he was named the Canadian Hockey League&#x27;s Goaltender of the Year. Blackburn was drafted by the New York Rangers in the first round of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, 10th overall.

==NHL career==
For most of 2001–02, Blackburn served as backup to longtime Rangers goalie, Mike Richter, playing in 31 games, a large total for a backup goaltender at the time. He was selected as the goaltender for the 2002 NHL All-Rookie Team and posted a 3.28 goals against average (GAA) and .898 save percentage.

With Richter out with a head injury, Blackburn recorded his only career shutout on November 7, 2002, in a 1–0 overtime win over the Calgary Flames. Blackburn dismissed concerns that the heavy workload would be too much for him by pointing out that he had endured a heavier workload in junior. However, after 17 consecutive starts, Blackburn eventually burned out, playing less effectively and tiring. It was becoming clear that Richter&#x27;s difficulties with post-concussion syndrome were unlikely to abate, and that more help was needed. &quot;We had to make a deal,&quot; Glen Sather claimed. &quot;I did not want to see Danny lose his confidence and struggle, or for our team to struggle.&quot;

Sather traded for Nashville Predator Mike Dunham, an experienced goaltender, to let Blackburn develop at a consistent rate. Blackburn finished the 2002–03 season with a 3.17 GAA and a .890 save percentage.

==Injuries and retirement==
A shoulder injury forced him into retirement in 2005.

He retired after missing the entire 2003–04 NHL season due to a nerve injury sustained just before training camp to his left shoulder due to a weightlifting mishap. He had nerve exploration surgery on March 31, 2004, then made an attempt to return to hockey, sporting a pair of blockers rather than the conventional blocker/catcher combination, as his injury rendered him incapable of rotating his glove hand. On February 1, 2005, he joined the Victoria Salmon Kings of the ECHL, going 3–9–0, with a 3.54 GAA in 12 games. On September 15, during the Rangers training camp, he suffered a strained MCL. Subsequently, Blackburn announced his retirement on September 25. Had Blackburn continued to attempt a comeback, he would have forfeited an insurance payout of approximately six million dollars.

After his retirement, Blackburn enrolled at Arizona State University. He later became the manager of business development for the Goaltender Development Institute. He currently resides in Dallas, Texas and Waltham, Massachusetts. When asked if he ever envisioned a return to hockey, he was quoted as saying, &quot;Never, I doubt I will ever put goalie pads on again. I don&#x27;t have interest in playing net.&quot; He also stated, &quot;It&#x27;s not bittersweet, you know what? I don&#x27;t really miss it anymore - it&#x27;s been such a long time. It was a chapter of my life and I&#x27;m on to the next...I don&#x27;t have any regrets at all about what transpired or the way things happened for me. I really enjoy what I do now in the business world...From my point of view, I was really fortunate, even though I was only there for a couple of years. It really set up the rest of my life for all the things that I want to do, from there on out.&quot;

On December 31, 2011, Blackburn participated in the 2012 Winter Classic Alumni Game at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, playing in goal for the Rangers alumni against the Philadelphia Flyers alumni.

<text>Manic Panic is the original line of fashion hair colors in the USA. Based in New York City, the company is run by Tish and Snooky Bellomo.

==History==
Sisters Tish and Snooky Bellomo opened the Manic Panic flagship boutique on July 7, 1977, at 33 St. Marks Place, in New York City’s East Village. Their headquarters are now located in Long Island City, New York after over 45 years in business.

Being native New Yorkers, and deeply involved in the New York punk music scene, they soon found themselves performing at many of the East Village venues. They performed regularly at the infamous CBGB, singing back up with Blondie, and their own punk band, The Sic F*cks. Known and loved for their colorful hair, which was very unconventional at the time, it wasn&#x27;t long before they introduced their own range of hair dyes and cosmetics right out of the Manic Panic store. When their hair color business boomed, the boutique closed. (The NYC store&#x27;s front and signage were featured prominently in a shot in the opening montage of Saturday Night Live&#x27;s 1980-81 season). 

Manic Panic is women-owned and independently operated by Tish and Snooky Bellomo, who have been referred to as &quot;The Martha Stewarts of Punk Rock&quot;. Manic Panic hair color is sold and distributed worldwide. Their products have been vegan and cruelty-free since 1977, with only a few exceptions of non-vegan products in their cosmetics line.

Manic Panic has been mentioned in many documentaries, crediting them for beginning what would become a trend and now the acceptance of men and women wearing &quot;fashion&quot; hair colors. Manic Panic has received numerous mentions in publications such as Vogue., Teen Vogue, Cosmopolitan, Nylon, The New Yorker, W, Rolling Stone.

Tish and Snooky continue to perform as musicians. They have recorded and performed live many times with Blue Coupe (a supergroup composed of original members of Blue Öyster Cult, along with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and original Alice Cooper bassist, Dennis Dunaway). They also continue to perform with the Sic F*cks, reuniting for special occasions like tributes to CBGB, Joey Ramone benefits, and various animal charity events.

==Products==

Apart from hair dye, Manic Panic sells many other products geared towards punk, gothic and fashion forward consumers.

<doc id="714187" wikidata="Q1342463" url="?curid=714187" title="Jason Blake (ice hockey)">
<text>Jason Wayne Blake (born September 2, 1973) is an American former professional ice hockey forward who played in the National Hockey League (NHL).

==Playing career==
===Junior career===
He played for the Waterloo Black Hawks of the United States Hockey League (USHL). Collegiately, he played one year at Ferris State University before transferring the University of North Dakota (UND). He had to sit out one season due to National Collegiate Athletic Association rules. He played three season for UND winning league titles all three years. Blake starred on their 1996–1997 National Championship team.

===Kings and Islanders===
Blake went undrafted and was signed as a free agent with the Orlando Solar Bears before being signed to an NHL contract by the Los Angeles Kings in 1999. He played in 64 games in 1999–00, his first season with the Kings, scoring 5 goals and played in 3 playoff games. In 2000, Blake joined Team USA at the World Championships. In the 2000–01 season, Blake played in only 17 games with the Kings before he was acquired by the New York Islanders in a January trade, who sent a conditional pick in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft in return. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Blake signed a brief contract with the Swiss team HC Lugano. While with the Islanders Blake played the wing on a line with Alexei Yashin. In 2004, Blake was selected as part of Team USA for the World Cup of Hockey. Blake set career highs in goals and points during the 2005–06 season with 28 and 57, respectively. The following season he topped both totals, scoring 40 goals and 69 points. The 40th goal was scored against the Toronto Maple Leafs on April 5, 2007. Along with Islanders teammates Rick DiPietro and Mark Parrish, Blake was part of Team USA at the Winter Olympics held in Turin Italy in February 2006. Team USA was led by Peter Laviolette, his former coach with the Islanders. Team USA finished eighth in the tournament. Blake scored his 100th career NHL goal against the Chicago Blackhawks at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on October 31, 2006. The milestone 100th goal came on the power play late in the 3rd period. Blake was named an all-star for the first time in his career during the 2006–07 NHL season. He recorded two assists in the 2007 NHL All-Star Game. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Blake became an unrestricted free agent. He was quoted in &quot;Newsday&quot; in February 2007 saying he would probably test the free agent market if not re-signed by the Islanders prior to the NHL trading deadline.

===Maple Leafs===
Blake was neither traded nor re-signed before the deadline and on July 1, 2007, Blake signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs to a five-year contract worth US$20 million.
Before the season began on October 8, 2007, Blake announced that he had been diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia, a rare but highly treatable form of cancer. He continued to play for the Maple Leafs for the rest of the season. In Blake&#x27;s first season with Toronto, he played in all 82 regular season games while scoring 15 goals and 52 points. While he managed a considerable number of points, he struggled to score goals all season, having over 300 shots on goal, easily a career high. He was awarded the Bill Masterton Trophy at the end of the season for perseverance and dedication to hockey through the difficult times he faced after being diagnosed with cancer. However, his 2008–09 season was up and down, with a fight during practice with teammate Mikhail Grabovski making headlines and being taken out of the gameday lineup for poor play. He finished the season with 25 goals and 63 points. In the 2009–10 season, Blake struggled for the Maple Leafs, posting 10 goals and 26 points in 55 games. In 2009, Blake was selected by Team USA for his second World Championship. He was traded to the Anaheim Ducks, along with Vesa Toskala, for Jean-Sébastien Giguère on January 31, 2010.

===Ducks and retirement===
Blake played the entire 2010–11 season with the Ducks compiling 16 goals and 32 points in 72 games. He began the 2011–12 season playing on a line with Teemu Selanne and Saku Koivu. On October 15, 2011, Blake and the Ducks were playing the San Jose Sharks when Sharks&#x27; defenceman Brent Burns accidentally cut Blake&#x27;s left arm/wrist after Blake fell down during a faceoff attempt. The cut required surgery to repair and kept Blake out of the lineup for three months. He returned to play for the Ducks in January 2012 scoring three goals in his first two games back. He finished the season with 45 games played, having scored 7 goals and 12 points. Following the season, Blake was again an unrestricted free agent. However, the season was delayed due to a lockout and Blake never signed with a team.

==Personal life==
Blake&#x27;s son, Jackson, was drafted in the fourth round, 109th overall, by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft. He played college ice hockey for North Dakota.

<doc id="714191" wikidata="Q896747" url="?curid=714191" title="Brad Bombardir">
<text>Luke Bradley Bombardir (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played for the New Jersey Devils, Minnesota Wild and the Nashville Predators in the NHL. He currently serves as the Minnesota Wild&#x27;s Director of Player Development and Senior Director of Community Relations.

==Playing career==
=== Amateur===
Growing up in British Columbia, Bombardir played minor hockey with the Powell River Paper Kings in the British Columbia Junior Hockey League from 1988 until 1990. As a result of his play, in which he recorded 10 goals and 25 assists in 60 games, Bombardir was selected in the third round, 56th overall, in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. He did not expect to be drafted and thus showed up at BC Place in a T-shirt and faded jeans instead of a suit and tie. Prior to the draft, Bombardir was expected to enrol at the University of North Dakota but considered playing in the Western Hockey League for the Victoria Cougars.

===Professional===
After graduating from the University of North Dakota with a degree in economic development, Bombardir began his professional career with the Albany River Rats in the American Hockey League (AHL). In 1996, his second year with the team, Bombardir was selected for the American Hockey League All-Star team. While entering his third professional season, an NHL lockout happened and Devils assistant coach Larry Robinson spent six weeks training the AHL team. When reflecting on the ordeal, Bombardir said: &quot;I learned more from him in those six weeks than from any other coach.&quot; However, Bombardir suffered a broken leg while chasing the puck and missed most of the 1996–1997 season. He returned to the lineup for the 1997–98 season where he made his NHL during a 4–1 loss to the Washington Capitals. Coach Jacques Lemaire praised Bombardir after his debut, saying: &quot;He played well. He was in control...We were confident when he was on the ice.&quot; On April 15, 1998, Bombardir recorded his first career NHL goal in a 5–4 loss to the Buffalo Sabres. 

During the 1999–2000 season, Bombardir made his NHL post-season debut while Scott Niedermayer was suspended. The Devils eventually won the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals and he brought the Cup to Powell River. His play during the 2000–01 season earned him a three-year contract extension with the Wild after he posted a career-high 15 assists. As well, although the Wild had been rotating captains each month, Bombardir became the first to serve two consecutive months in January and February. In October 2001, Bombardir fractured his right ankle and was expected to miss two months to recover. The injury occurred during a 3-3 tie with the Edmonton Oilers when he was smashed into the boards by Ethan Moreau. At the time of the injury, Bombardir was playing 25 minutes a game, more than any Wild player. Upon returning to the team&#x27;s lineup, he recorded his first goal in 104 games during a 5–3 win over the Anaheim Mighty Ducks on February 28, 2002.

Bombardir returned to the Wild for the 2003–04 season where he was again named captain of the team in January. In February, Bombardir and Sergei Zholtok were traded to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a third and fourth-round pick in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft.

==Post-career==
In September 2006, Bombardir accepted a full-time position as the director of community partnerships for the Minnesota Wild. Following this, Bombardir was appointed Director of Player Development in 2010.

==Personal life==
Bombardir and his wife Heather have three children together.

<text>Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Maury (March 21, 1866 – January 8, 1952) was an American astronomer who was the first to detect and calculate the orbit of a spectroscopic binary. She published an important early catalog of stellar spectra using her own system of stellar classification, which was later adopted by the International Astronomical Union. She also spent many years studying the binary star Beta Lyrae. Maury was part of the Harvard Computers, a group of female astronomers and human computers at the Harvard College Observatory.

Antonia Maury was awarded the Annie Jump Cannon Award in Astronomy in 1943. William Wilson Morgan, one of the developers of the MK system of stellar classification, which builds upon her work, has said that he considers Antonia Maury &quot;for me, the single greatest mind that has ever engaged itself in the field of the morphology of stellar spectra.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Caetana de Paiva Pereira Maury was born in Cold Spring, New York, on March 21, 1866. She was named in honor of her maternal grandmother, Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner Draper, the daughter of a physician at the court of John VI of Portugal and Charlotte of Spain. The family fled Portugal for Brazil because of the Napoleonic Wars.

Maury&#x27;s father was the Reverend Mytton Maury, an amateur naturalist, a direct descendant of the Reverend James Maury and one of the sons of Sarah Mytton Maury. Maury&#x27;s mother was Virginia Draper, a daughter of Antonia Caetana de Paiva Pereira Gardner and Dr. John William Draper.

Maury was also the granddaughter of John William Draper and a niece of Henry Draper and his wife Mary Anna Draper, all pioneering astronomers. Mary Anna Draper funded research at Harvard College Observatory through the creation of the Henry Draper Memorial Fund.
As a result of their family connections, Antonia and her two siblings were exposed to science at a very early age. Her younger sister, Carlotta Maury, went on to become a geologist, stratigrapher, and paleontologist.

Antonia Maury attended Vassar College, graduating in 1887 with honors in physics, astronomy, and philosophy. At Vassar she studied under the tutelage of renowned astronomer Maria Mitchell. She was one of seven graduates chosen to give an addresses at her commencement.

==Career==
After completing her undergraduate work, Maury went to work at the Harvard College Observatory as one of the so-called Harvard Computers, highly skilled women who processed astronomical data. Her salary was 25 cents, half the amount paid to men at that time.

In 1887, Edward Charles Pickering had found the first spectroscopic binary or double star, ζ1 Ursae Majoris (Mizar A). Maury was asked to determine its orbit, which she did using periodic doubling of some of the lines in its spectrum. Then, in 1889, Maury discovered a second spectroscopic binary, Beta Aurigae, and calculated its orbital period. Learning of this work from a copy of the &quot;Annual Report of the Henry Draper Memorial&quot;, Colonel John Herschel the Younger (son of eminent astronomer John Herschel) recognized the importance of her achievements by writing to Pickering, the observatory&#x27;s director. Herschel asked Pickering &quot;to convey to Miss Maury my congratulations on having connected her name with one of the most notable advances in physical astronomy ever made.&quot;

However, when the first spectroscopic binary and its orbit were more widely reported, the name connected with it was Pickering. The discovery was announced by Pickering in a presentation to the Philadelphia meeting of the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1889. The work was described in a paper &quot;On the Spectrum of Zeta Ursae Majoris&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; in 1890. In both cases the only mention of Maury was a single line, stating that &quot;a careful study of the results has been made by Miss. A. C. Maury, a niece of Dr. Draper&quot;. The sole author credit was given as Pickering.
In 1888, Maury was assigned to observe stellar spectra of bright stars in the northern celestial hemisphere and catalog them. Her work contributed to the construction of the &quot;Henry Draper Catalogue&quot;. By 1924, the catalogue would contain 225,300 stellar spectra, described in terms of their characteristics. By 2017, it would have 359,083 entries.

The Harvard Observatory staff used an alphabetical system of classification designed by Williamina P. Fleming and Annie Jump Cannon. Maury found their classification system inadequate and developed her own. It was considerably more detailed and included information about temperature and about the width, distinctness, and intensity of spectral lines.

In 1891 Maury left the observatory and started teaching in the Gilman School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Pickering asked her to return and complete her observations, and she said that she was uncomfortable completing her research if her work was unacknowledged.

She returned in 1893 and 1895 and published her observations of stellar spectra in an important catalogue of classifications in 1897. &quot;Spectra of Bright Stars Photographed With the 11-Inch Draper Telescope As Part of the Henry Draper Memorial and Discussed by Antonia C. Maury Under the Direction of Edward Charles Pickering&quot; (1897) presented the results of Maury&#x27;s examination of 4,800 stellar photographs, using her own system of classification, and analyzed 681 bright northern stars in detail. It was the first observatory publication to have a woman&#x27;s name in the title.

Pickering and others at the observatory disagreed with Maury&#x27;s system of classification and explanation of differing line widths, and refused to use it. It was partly in response to this negative reaction to her work that she decided to leave the observatory. However, by 1908 Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung had realized the value of her classifications and used them in his system of identifying very bright red giant stars from faint dwarf stars. Hertzsprung wrote to Pickering:

In 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) modify its classification system based on the work done by Maury and Hertzsprung, a formulation known as the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Astronomer Dorrit Hoffleit has presented scientific evidence to support the view that stellar morphology was held back by 30 years as a result of the failure to adopt Antonia Maury&#x27;s stellar classification theory sooner.

Between 1896 and 1918 Maury taught physics and chemistry at the Castle School (Miss C.E. Mason&#x27;s Suburban School for Girls) in Tarrytown, New York. She also gave lectures on astronomy at Cornell University.

In 1918, Maury returned to Harvard College Observatory as an adjunct professor. With Pickering&#x27;s successor Harlow Shapley she was given credit for her work, which was published under her own name. She stayed in the observatory until her retirement in 1948.
Her work summarizing many years of research on the spectroscopic analysis of the binary star Beta Lyrae was published in 1933.

== Awards ==

Antonia Maury was a member of the American Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society.
In 1943, she was awarded the Annie Jump Cannon Award in Astronomy by the American Astronomical Society.

The lunar crater Maury and a number of smaller ejecta craters are co-named for Antonia Maury. They were originally named for her cousin, Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, United States and later Confederate navies, and are, perhaps, the only lunar features shared by two cousins.

In 1978, the &quot;Revised MK Spectral Atlas for Stars Earlier Than the Sun&quot; honored &quot;Antonia C. Maury, Master Morphologist of Stellar Spectra&quot; in its dedication.

== Later years ==
After retirement, Maury pursued interests in nature and conservation. She belonged to the National Audubon Society and enjoyed birdwatching. She fought to save western &quot;Sequoia&quot; trees from being felled during wartime.

For three years, Maury also served as curator of the John William Draper House in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where her grandfather and uncle had built observatories, and where the first photos of the moon as seen through a telescope were taken.

Maury died on January 8, 1952, in Dobbs Ferry, New York.

<doc id="714202" wikidata="Q313712" url="?curid=714202" title="Corin Nemec">
<text>Joseph Charles Nemec IV (born November 5, 1971), known professionally as Corin Nemec, is an American actor, producer, and screenwriter. He was billed as Corin &quot;Corky&quot; Nemec or Corky Nemec until 1990.

Nemec is known for playing the title character in the sitcom &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot; (1990–1993), Jonas Quinn in the science fiction series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, and Harold Lauder in the miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot;. He is known in India for his role as Allan in 2007 film &quot;Parzania.&quot;

==Early life==
Nemec was born on November 5, 1971. His mother Janis was a graphic artist, as well as a painter, writer, and poet. His father, Joseph Charles Nemec III, is of Czech descent, and works in the film industry as a set designer and production designer. His older sister, Anastacia C. Nemec, works also as an assistant director.

Nemec was inspired to become an actor after watching the children&#x27;s film &quot;The Goonies&quot; at the age of 13, for which his father had done the art direction. He also cites his parents&#x27; artistic professions as a major influence, and that acting &quot;seemed the right thing to do&quot;.

Nemec is a well-known graffiti artist, helping to pioneer graffiti writing styles and practices in the San Fernando Valley starting in the late 1980s.

==Career==

Nemec began training with the Centre Stage LA theater company and signed on with an agent after performing in one of its talent showcases. He was booked for several commercials, such as Suzuki, and eventually landed a guest-spot on the TV show &quot;Sidekicks&quot; starring Ernie Reyes Jr., with whom Nemec is still friends. His first major film role was &quot;&quot; in 1988. He appeared in several TV shows, earning an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Steven Stayner in the NBC miniseries
&quot;I Know My First Name Is Steven&quot;. He starred alongside actors Jack Palance, Peter Boyle, and Charlton Heston in the 1990 feature film &quot;Solar Crisis&quot;.

Nemec played the lead in the TV series &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot; from 1990 to 1993. Also, in 1993, Nemec was cast as Harold Lauder in a TV adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Stand&quot;. In 1997, he played a notable role in the movie &quot;Goodbye, America&quot;. He also starred in the TV movies &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; alongside Jeanne Tripplehorn and &quot;Blackout&quot; with Jane Seymour. Nemec made appearances on several TV shows, including &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, and &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;. He also portrayed the serial killers Richard Speck and Ted Bundy. He played leading parts in some original Sci Fi Channel (United States) made-for-TV movies such as &quot;Sea Beast&quot;, &quot;Mansquito&quot;, &quot;SS Doomtrooper&quot;, &quot;Dragon Wasps&quot;, and &quot;Lake Placid vs. Anaconda&quot; and some original movies for Lifetime (TV network).

During the 1990s, Nemec had a brief foray into hip-hop, recording an entire album with the group Starship of Foolz, developed by Matt Robinson and Dedra Tate, and produced by actor Balthazar Getty. Nemec also produced a new comic series that starred Paul Mooney, father of fellow Starship of Foolz member Shane Mooney, as the president of the United States. He also appeared in the music video &quot;Beer for My Horses&quot; by Toby Keith and Willie Nelson.

From 2002 to 2004, he appeared as Jonas Quinn on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, temporarily replacing Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) in the line-up of the SG-1 team.

In January 2013, while working on the film &quot;Poseidon Rex&quot;, Nemec was involved in a boating accident. While he was being transported to set aboard a Belize Coast Guard vessel, the boat ran into a semi-submerged barge. The entire right side of his body was shattered; he required multiple blood transfusions to save his life, and he underwent five surgeries.

==Personal life==
Corin dated Jami Beth Schahn when they were teenagers, and in 1993 they had their first child. Corin and Jami married in 2002 and had their second child in 2005. Corin and Jami divorced in 2009 and share custody of their children. 

Nemec is close friends with actor David Faustino of television sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, with whom he has a production company that co-produced the debut album from Austin-based band Hollow featuring Jon Dishongh. Nemec and Faustino co-starred in &quot;Star-ving&quot;, a web series that spoofs HBO&#x27;s &quot;Entourage&quot;.

On September 22, 2022, the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; reported Corin was moving to Tampa Bay to begin production on a series of independent films with Scatter Brothers Productions, and met his girlfriend Sabrina Nova there.

Nemec married Sabrina Nova in July 2023.
Hulk Hogan attended the wedding.

<text>The Advanced Space Vision System (also known as the Space Vision System or SVS) is a computer vision system designed primarily for International Space Station (ISS) assembly. The system uses regular 2D cameras in the Space Shuttle bay, on the Canadarm, or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object.

Because of the small number of viewing ports on the station and on the shuttle, most of the assembly and maintenance is done using cameras, which do not give stereoscopic vision, and thus do not allow a proper evaluation of depth. In addition the difficult conditions created by the particular conditions of illumination and obscurity in space, make it much more difficult to distinguish objects, even when the assembly work can be viewed directly, without using a camera. For instance, the harsh glare of direct sunlight can blind human vision. Also, the contrasts between objects in black shadows and objects in the solar light are much greater than in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, even where no glare is involved.

==Background==

The Advanced Space Vision System images objects with cooperative targets and uses the known positions of the targets to triangulate their exact relative positions in real time. The targets are composed of thin films of silicon dioxide layered with inconel to form an inconel interference stack. A stack like this has nearly no reflectivity in the Electromagnetic spectrum. The result is a black color that appears even blacker than the flattest black paint. In photos the disks look like small black dots, and a minimum of three are needed, so they are quite unobtrusive on most payloads.

==Development==

The basic elements of the system were devised at the National Research Council of Canada in the 1970s, to study car collisions. In 1990, development was transferred to Neptec Design Group, a small commercial enterprise located in Kanata, a suburb of Ottawa. The system runs on Neptec&#x27;s Advanced Vision Unit (AVU) processing platform, which handles video routing, algorithm processing, video overlays, and the system interface. The operating system is the Unix-like and POSIX compliant QNX Real-time operating system, running the Photon windowing interface. The Photon implementation was optimized to be the most worry free direct manipulation interface possible for the particular needs and work habits of the astronauts.

The Canadian Space Agency was involved at several stages in the development and deployment of the space vision system. Training for the system takes place in the simulators located at the agency&#x27;s headquarters at the John H. Chapman Space Centre near Montreal.

==Implementation==
The system was first tested in its early form on STS-52 in October 1992, and used in subsequent missions. The advanced version was first tested on STS-74 in November 1995. The system has been used with success on shuttle flights since then, and with equal success for the assembly and maintenance of the station since 1997.

<text>Jason Drandon Botterill (born May 19, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger and executive who is currently serving as an assistant general manager of the Seattle Kraken of the National Hockey League (NHL). Botterill was the former associate GM of the Pittsburgh Penguins before serving as general manager of the Buffalo Sabres from May 11, 2017, to June 16, 2020.

==Playing career==
Botterill was drafted by the Dallas Stars in the first round with the 20th overall selection of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. Before turning pro, he played four seasons (1993–97) at the University of Michigan, where he helped lead the Wolverines to an NCAA national championship in 1996. He is the only Canadian to ever win a gold medal in three straight World Junior Hockey Championships. In eight seasons as a pro, Botterill played in 481 professional games, including 88 in the National Hockey League with the Dallas Stars, Atlanta Thrashers, Calgary Flames, and Buffalo Sabres. Other stops in his career included the Michigan K-Wings and Orlando Solar Bears of the International Hockey League and the Saint John Flames of the American Hockey League, where he was a member of the 2001 Calder Cup championship team. After serving as the Flames captain in 2001–02, Botterill signed with Buffalo as a free agent.

Botterill&#x27;s career was abruptly halted when, as a member of the Rochester Americans, he suffered a concussion during a game against the Syracuse Crunch on October 31, 2004. After missing the next 49 games, Botterill announced his retirement from hockey.

==Management career==
Botterill received his MBA from The Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan in 2007. Following his playing career, he worked with the NHL Offices and the NHL Central Registry and spent the 2006–2007 season as a scout for the Dallas Stars.

On July 17, 2007, the Pittsburgh Penguins announced Botterill&#x27;s hiring as director of hockey administration. His main responsibilities included monitoring the salary cap and contract research and negotiations, but also worked with salary arbitration and preparation as well as scouting. Botterill was promoted by the Penguins to assistant general manager on May 22, 2009. He replaced Chuck Fletcher, who was named general manager of the Minnesota Wild on the same day. In &quot;The Hockey News&quot; 2011 edition of the 100 Most Powerful People in ice hockey, Botterill was considered one of the Top 40 under the age of 40. On May 16, 2014, Botterill was named as interim general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins and as a candidate for the full position. On June 6, 2014, Jim Rutherford was named general manager of the Penguins. In his press conference, Rutherford announced that Botterill would be named associate general manager of the Penguins. 

On May 11, 2017, the Buffalo Sabres announced that Botterill had been hired as the team&#x27;s general manager. He was fired by the Sabres on June 16, 2020.

On January 5, 2021, the Seattle Kraken announced that Botterill had been hired as the team&#x27;s assistant general manager.

==Personal life==
Botterill was born in Edmonton, Alberta, but grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Jason&#x27;s sister, Jennifer Botterill, enjoyed numerous hockey successes with the Canadian women&#x27;s team, before retiring in 2011. His mother, Doreen McCannell, participated in speed skating at the 1964 and 1968 Winter Olympics. His father, Cal Botterill, is a professor at the University of Winnipeg.

<text>André Courrèges (; 9 March 1923 – 7 January 2016) was a French fashion designer. He was particularly known for his streamlined 1960s designs influenced by modernism and futurism, exploiting modern technology and new fabrics. Courrèges defined the go-go boot and along with Mary Quant, is one of the designers credited with inventing the miniskirt.

== Early life ==
Courrèges was born in the city of Pau within the Bearnese region of the Pyrenees. He wanted to pursue design in art school but his father, a butler, disapproved of his passion as he wanted him to be an engineer. Courrèges attended École Nationale des Ponts-et-Chaussées (École des ponts ParisTech). During World War II, he became a pilot for the French Air Force.

== Career ==

===Early beginnings===
In 1945, at 22, after studying to be a civil engineer, Courrèges went to Paris to work at the fashion house Jeanne Lafaurie. A few months later, he went to work for Cristóbal Balenciaga. Courrèges worked for Balenciaga for 10 years mastering the cut and construction of garments.

===&quot;Courrèges&quot;===

=== 1961-63 ===
In 1961, Courrèges launched his own fashion house. For the first couple of years of its existence, Courrèges was known for well-tailored suits and dresses with geometric seaming, clean lines, and the standard knee-length hemlines of the time, somewhat like Pierre Cardin of the period. His superbly cut trousers also attracted notice. His designs&#x27; style was shaped by Balenciaga, with garments that were well sculpted for women.

His clientele were mature and conservative women with high disposable income.

In 1963, he began to be known for extremely simple, geometric, modern designs, trousers for women, and a predilection for white, including the &quot;little white dress.&quot; His slim fall 1963 trousers extended in a clean line onto the top of the foot. Designers that season showed women&#x27;s boots of all heights for the first time, establishing a norm that would continue in autumn collections for at least the next fifteen years. Courrèges&#x27;s clothes for 1963 were often paired with flat, slim-shafted boots to the lower calf. The white versions attracted particular attention and became known as the Courrèges boot, which evolved into the popular go-go boot. Boots of this shape would be a staple of his collections for the next two years.

=== 1964-65 ===
Courrèges would reach a peak of fame and influence with his three 1964 and &#x27;65 collections, and it is these collections for which he is most remembered. They introduced miniskirts to the haute couture, popularized pantsuits, and made flat shoes, white boots, metallic silver, and oversized glasses characteristic elements of 1960s fashion. They were still strictly haute couture collections, but they conveyed the futuristic Space Age pulse of the time with spare, adroitly tailored clothes that simultaneously gave women a sense of freedom and suggested deeper societal changes. With these collections, Courrèges intended to overcome the uncomfortable artifice that had dominated women&#x27;s fashion during the 1950s. He promoted a new body type that he felt was more in line with modern women&#x27;s lives. These collections were so transformative that some fashion writers compared them to Christian Dior&#x27;s 1947 Corolle collection in importance. Their influence would extend through about 1967, touching everyone from top hairdresser Vidal Sassoon to Coco Chanel, who showed her first pantsuits a few months after Courrèges introduced them to the couture in 1964. Ultra-modern US designer Rudi Gernreich was moved to shorten his skirts to mini length after seeing Courrèges&#x27;s 1964 work, and both designers were early advocates of bralessness. The designer perhaps most obviously influenced was fellow Balenciaga protegé Emanuel Ungaro. During this period, Courrèges cited architects Le Corbusier and Eero Saarinen and artist Wassily Kandinsky as inspirations.

While revolutionary in the ways described, these collections were a continuation of longstanding trends toward less constricting fit that had begun in the 1950s. Courrèges&#x27;s short skirts, braless torsos, waistless dresses, flat shoes, and trousers during this period were indeed freeing for women, but the clothes also continued the 1950s tendency to impose an artificial silhouette on the body via strong, 1950s-style tailoring that some described as stiff, rigid, and soldierly.

==== Spring 1964 ====
His spring 1964 collection continued to feature his distinctive boots, popularized pantsuits, and brought above-the-knee skirts to Paris haute couture for the first time. White dominated the collection. He presented simple, slightly flaring chemise dresses that hit above the knee, well above the knee when paired with his signature calf-high boots. The previous season, fall 1963, almost all designers had shown boots of various heights, but for spring of &#x27;64, Courrèges was the only designer to include boots. Their characteristic narrow cut and perfect proportions continued to win praise from the fashion press. Low-heeled pumps were also shown. His trouser outfits attracted the most attention, launching the pantsuit trend that would change societal norms during the decade. This season, his pants remained narrow but were set on the hip, creased in front, and slit over the instep to maintain a clean, unbroken line. They were paired with simple, well-tailored, geometric-looking coats, jackets, and tunics featuring prominent buttons, low-set martingales, and the pocket flaps that would become one of Courrèges&#x27;s signature design details. Coats were seven-eighths length. He showed his day clothes with large, tall, mostly brimless, Space Age-looking hats. His trouser emphasis extended into evening, when he also incorporated a lot of bare skin with uncovered backs and openwork lace. These clothes were presented in a traditional, dignified salon showing with classical music and floral perfume.

==== Fall 1964 ====

His autumn 1964 collection advanced the fashion industry with modern, futuristic designs that were unheard of during the time. Trousers dominated the showing, slit over the instep like those he had shown the previous season but with a slightly narrower cut and pronounced creases in front and back. The collection included tailored coats, jackets, and tunics, which were paired with trousers or his version of the miniskirt. &quot;He paired his shorter skirts with white or colored leather, calf-high boots that added a confident flair to the ensemble. This look became one of the most important fashion developments of the decade and was widely copied.&quot; His familiar short, geometric shift dresses were marked with a characteristic small sleeve. Coats were narrow. Jackets were longer and had deeper vents than previously. Some were marked with a hip seam. The clothes held their shape via precise tailoring and fabrics of substantial body, many double-faced, with a great deal of gabardine. He showed no regular shoes for fall &#x27;64, only boots. The boots were the same height and shape as those he&#x27;d been showing since 1963 but with pleating or vertical stitching at the top of the shaft. As in his previous collections, the white kid ones were the most popular, but he also offered them in patent finishes, suede, lizard, and vinyl of various colors, as well as evening versions of silver sequins or ribbon-trimmed pink satin, part of an increased emphasis on evening clothes in the collection. His evening dresses were as short as his day dresses, but evening trousers dominated. Evening styles could have accents of Space Age silver, metallic pink, metallic green, and other colors, all combined with and dominated by Courrèges&#x27;s signature stark white, the sheen provided by ciré finishes, lamé, sequins, geometric paillettes, and vinyl. Bareness continued to be a feature, especially in evening clothes, where midriffs and backs were often on display. The presentation included a model getting dressed from a state of near nudity. Starting with this collection, models dressing and undressing onstage would be a mainstay of Courrèges shows that would last into the early 1970s. The most talked-about hats from the collection were helmet-like squared-off bonnets that matched the clothes and tied in the middle of the chin with a stiff geometric bow. Smaller, tightly tailored hats set on the crown of the head were also shown. Short, white gloves were included with almost everything. The models used by Courrèges this season were famously slim, muscular, and very tanned, striding out to the beat of drums.

==== Spring 1965 ====

He continued with his spare, futuristic autumn 1964 styles into spring of 1965, when he shortened his skirts even more and opened the toes of his signature calf-high white boots. His spring 1965 collection also included flat Mary Jane shoes, a style that would become a mainstay for the designer through the end of the decade. His spring 1965 versions had the same open toes as the boots and featured a bow on the instep strap. Some of the boots also had a wraparound horizontal cutout near the top of the shaft, suggesting an absent ribbon. The open toe on this footwear was not the shaped, contoured hole usually seen on open-toed pumps but what looked like a straight lopping off of the front of the foot piece or as if the front of the toe piece hadn&#x27;t been sewn down to the sole but had just been left open, the toes hidden beneath but receiving air from the open end. Other accessories included opaque white glasses with a slightly curved horizontal slit for vision; short white gloves; low, narrow hip-belts; band-edged, squared-off, cowboy- and mortarboard-looking hats with chin straps; and striped scarves to match outfits. The collection was still largely white, but included more colors, including pastels, brights, navy blue, and black, as well as some plaids and stripes. Some jackets were lined in large, graphic stripes. He made prominent use of graphic banding for emphasis, including along the inseams of trousers. His trousers this season sat lower on the hip and were no longer slit over the foot. Pockets were now mere horizontal slits, often outlined in the same color as the banding. He showed a lone pair of jodhpurs in yellow-and-white plaid. His new shorter skirts were given the most emphasis this time, still carefully tailored to a geometric trapeze shape in minimal, sleeveless or short-sleeved shift dresses, many with small, rolled, stand-away collars and lapels. Necklines could be round or square. Coats were similar but with long sleeves. Many of the jackets were of a simple waist length, establishing a style that would become characteristic of his collections into the 1970s. Most waistlines this season were dropped to hip level and marked with a thin belt. New this season were suspender dresses/suspender skirts, miniskirts with suspender-like extensions over the shoulders. These suspender skirts were often in wide horizontal stripes with matching coats or jackets and worn with sleeveless or minimally sleeved white tops. Suits were double- or single-breasted. Eveningwear was in the same shapes as daywear but with sections made to shimmer with solid coverings of tiny sequins. This season&#x27;s runway strip scene involved a pink wool suit being removed to reveal Courrèges undergarments consisting of sleeveless top, hip-slung short shorts, and calf-high socks, all in a transparent fabric embroidered with white dots. This spring 1965 collection built on the reputation of the previous two collections to achieve an astounding level of influence.

Controversy over who created the idea for the miniskirt revolves around Courrèges and Mary Quant. Courrèges explicitly claimed to have invented it, accusing his London rival to the claim, Quant, of merely &quot;commercialising&quot; it. Courrèges presented short skirts (four inches above the knee) in January 1965 for that year&#x27;s Spring/Summer collection. He had presented &quot;above-the-knee&quot; skirts in the previous year, with his August 1964 haute couture presentation proclaimed the &quot;best show seen so far&quot; for that season by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Valerie Steele has stated that Courrèges was designing short skirts as early as 1961, although she champions Quant&#x27;s claim to have created the miniskirt first as being more convincingly supported by evidence. Others, such as Jess Cartner-Morley of &quot;The Guardian&quot; explicitly credit Courrèges with having invented the miniskirt. &quot;The Independent&quot; also stated that &quot;Courreges was the inventor of the miniskirt: at least in his eyes and those of the French fashion fraternity ... The argument came down to high fashion vs street fashion and to France versus Britain – there&#x27;s no conclusive evidence either way.&quot; British &quot;Vogue&quot; considered John Bates the true inventor of the miniskirt, rather than Courrèges or Quant.

Courrèges&#x27;s favoured materials included plastics such as vinyl and stretch fabrics like Lycra. While he preferred white and silver, he often used flashes of citrus colour, and the predominantly white designs in his August 1964 show were tempered with touches of his signature clear pink, a &quot;bright stinging&quot; green, various shades of brown from dark to pale, and poppy red.

Alongside short skirts, Courrèges was renowned for his trouser suits, cut-out backs and midriffs, all designed for a new type of athletic, active young woman. Steele has described Courrèges&#x27;s work as a &quot;brilliant couture version of youth fashion.&quot; One of Courrèges&#x27;s most distinctive looks, a knit bodystocking with a gabardine miniskirt slung around the hips, was widely copied and plagiarised, much to his chagrin, and it would be 1967 before he again held a press showing for his work.

=== 1965-66 Hiatus ===
Disturbed by the uncontrolled copying of his fall 1964 and spring 1965 lines, Courrèges declined to present a fall 1965 collection and wouldn&#x27;t show again until 1967. He produced no collections for fall 1965, spring 1966, or fall 1966, though he did make a few garments for private clients. He was bothered especially by the low quality of the copies he&#x27;d seen, feeling that the average woman was being denied high quality because of shoddy imitations. He also became concerned about affordability, resolving to create a lower-priced ready-to-wear line so that more people could have access to his work. Like a number of particularly young designers of the time, he began to see haute couture, with its multiple fittings and high cost, as outdated and out of step with modern women&#x27;s lives and with economic realities. He spent his time trying to secure manufacturers who could produce high-quality, lower-cost garments for a new ready-to-wear line that Courrèges would call Couture Future, to be sold in a new boutique downstairs from his couture salon, which was being moved from Kleber Avenue to François I Street in Paris, enabled by backing from French beauty concern l&#x27;Oréal.

=== 1967-71 ===

In February of 1967, Courrèges resumed his couture showings after a year and a half of not producing collections. The same month, he introduced a ready-to-wear line to be sold in a new boutique downstairs from his Paris couture salon, which had moved from Kleber Avenue to François I Street. He referred to his ready-to-wear line as Couture Future and would initially only sell it at his flagship boutique, not debuting new ready-to-wear styles via fashion shows but instead adding new styles continuously to the boutique stock. The following year, he began presenting his ready-to-wear line mixed in with his couture garments in a single fashion show each season. While the new ready-to-wear line would be roughly a quarter the price of his couture garments and thus accessible to more women, it was still costly.

His 1967 through &#x27;71 collections looked very different from the 1964-65 clothes that had brought him fame. Skirts were still mini length – even more so, in fact; shoes were still flat; and there was still a lot of white and a futuristic look to everything, but lines were now more rounded and curvilinear, there was more color, and there was less stiffness. Observers described the new clothes as softer, &quot;sweeter,&quot; and more &quot;girlish&quot; than his famous 1964-65 creations. Dress and coat shapes were now most often of an A-line, paper doll-like silhouette that flared from the ribcage to a mini or micromini hem. There was now even more of a child-like look than there had been when he showed baby bonnet-looking headgear in 1964, as he presented occasional infant-style rompers and his models painted big freckles on their faces and wore their hair in little girl-style ponytails on either side of the head. Courrèges continued to favor short hair, showing geometric-looking, blunt-cut, chin-length, crayon-vivid Dynel wigs from 1968 to 1970.

He used more medium-build and rounded models than the slim, tanned, athletic models he had famously used for his shows in 1964 and &#x27;65, now having them smile and dance onstage, usually to percussive jazz music, instead of striding soberly, a feature that he would maintain until 1973.

Diagnostic of this 1967 to &#x27;71 period for Courrèges was an emphasis on jumpsuits instead of pantsuits. Notable were ribknit bodystockings/jumpsuits, some footless, some with feet, that he referred to as catsuits. He intended these ribbed bodystockings/catsuits to be the basis of a dress scheme, a background for his other garments. For summer, they were offered in shorts lengths. The use of tights and bodystockings as background garments was a trend of the time that fit well with Courrèges&#x27;s emphasis on functionality in dress.

As with his pre-hiatus collections, he used lots of welt seaming and geometric construction. There was continuity also in his 1967-71 inclusion of waist-length jackets, which he had debuted in 1965 but now cut somewhat more like jean jackets in both short-sleeve and long-sleeved styles, a style he would present well into the 1970s. He also showed waist-length capes. From 1967 to &#x27;69, he scalloped the edges of many of his garments, as had Cardin in the mid-sixties,
 giving them a slightly frilly appearance that still managed to look geometric. He favored flower motifs in 1967-68, somewhat similar to Mary Quant&#x27;s trademark use of daisies and paralleling the emphasis on flowers in the era&#x27;s youth culture.

Courrèges was one of a group of designers (Rudi Gernreich, Paco Rabanne, Emanuel Ungaro, etc) in the late sixties who rejected moves toward ethnic, hippie, and revival styles, which they referred to as nostalgic, and continued to show futuristic designs in almost exclusively mini and micromini lengths. Courrèges&#x27;s expressions of this tendency included continued use of stark white; circular and curvilinear geometry; lots of zippers, tabs, and snaps; and prominent use of plastic and vinyl, though traditional fabrics of more substantial body like wools and cottons still made up the bulk of his textiles. In addition to vinyl, he used leather, especially for coats, some of which were wet-look shiny. 1970 saw Courrèges using leather and patent leather accents in the form of piping and banding, including on his knit bodystockings/catsuits and on his knee socks. That year, it was unclear to fashion-watchers whether the mini-favoring modernists would prevail or the midi-pushing nostalgics, and Courrèges, Gernreich, et al were briefly focused on as potential leaders again, as they had been in the mid-sixties.

Courrèges added a few longer skirt lengths beginning in 1969, when he showed some calf-length evening dresses that were just extended versions of his shorter dress shapes. His spring 1969 collection also featured solid metal microminis with matching metal breastbands that were as futuristic as but very different than the well known 1966-67 Paco Rabanne trapeze minidresses that had consisted of separate small plates of metal. In 1970, the year the fashion world tried to impose calf-length hemlines on everyone, Courrèges included knee lengths, calf lengths, and ankle lengths in both his daywear and eveningwear, though minis and microminis still dominated his offerings.

Courrèges&#x27;s main pant styles of this period also followed the trends of the time, starting off with his signature long, sleek trousers but expanding into flared and even hiphugger bellbottom styles by the end of the period, particularly in 1968-70. He also showed lower-thigh-length shorts styles. He reflected the era&#x27;s ethnic trends somewhat when in 1967 he included a jumpsuit with harem legs and when in 1969 he showed a few pairs of full, knee-length pants that he called knickers, a trouser trend of the time, but his were full enough to look like bloomers, zouaves, or cossack pants. He showed short shorts under maxicoats and maxidresses when the hot pants trend peaked in 1971.

It was at the end of the 1960s that Courrèges really maximized his use of cutouts, placing circular cutouts in the center of the chest, the center of the stomach, on the sides, or down the legs that allowed the ribknit bodystocking or bare skin to show beneath. This was a trend that had been more widespread during Courrèges&#x27;s hiatus year of 1966, when Pierre Cardin may have been its biggest proponent, but it continued to be seen among Space Age designers like Courrèges and Ungaro. The trend toward bareness and nudity of the time was also acknowledged by Courrèges in see-through fabrics, runway toplessness, and backs so low they revealed the derrière, as well as more traditional devices like plunging surplice and keyhole necklines. In 1971, he introduced a bare cut to some of his tops that resembled the top of overalls, with an open-sided front panel and loose straps over the shoulders, a style he would continue to show through the mid-seventies.

His boots from 1967 to 1970 were still completely flat, but now mostly knee-high and fitted, in the dominant style of the time, very different from the 1963-65 boot style that had made him famous. In 1970, he showed some boots with fuller shafts, as boot trends were moving in that direction in the new decade. The other footwear he showed in this 1967-71 period continued to be the flat Mary Janes that he had first included in 1965, sometimes referred to as slippers. These boots and Mary Janes would change design details from season to season, broad and round-toed one season, squared the next, trimmed in metal the next, and even with light-up plastic accents in 1970. For summer, he favored knee socks more than boots, with sheer ones for evening, also showing them for fall, and he included some over-the-knee stockings.

During this period, he made playful, futuristic, oversized eyewear a characteristic element of his shows, creating lenses that looked like huge cartoon eyes (1969) or huge eyelids edged in cartoonish eyelashes (1970). In 1968, he introduced his first purse designs to his ready-to-wear line, and in 1969 his first swimsuits.

In 1970, a second, even lower-priced ready-to-wear line was added called Hyperbole, as Courrèges continued to be concerned about the accessibility of his work. He would still maintain his made-to-order haute couture line, officially renaming it Prototypes in 1971.

In 1967 Courrèges married Coqueline Barrière, his design assistant. They had met while working together at Balenciaga, and worked together as a husband and wife team for the rest of his life.

=== 1972-79 ===
In 1968 Courrèges sold a share of his company to L&#x27;Oréal in order to finance his expansion, which, by 1972, included 125 boutiques around the world. That year, Courrèges was commissioned to design staff uniforms for the Munich Olympics. He began offering menswear in 1973. He also developed fragrances such as Empreinte, Courrèges Homme, Eau de Courrèges, Courrèges Blue, Sweet Courrèges, and Generation Courrèges.

His womenswear from 1972 through &#x27;79 conformed to some extent to the trends of the time, but he remained devoted to shorter hems than most and to continued use of plastic, metallic silver, and white during this era of longer skirts, natural fibers, and earthtones. The question in the year 1970 of whether ethnic, nostalgic looks or geometric, modern/futuristic looks would prevail had been answered, as longer lengths, ethnic/gypsy/peasant influences, quiet classics, and sturdy workwear like blue jeans became the norm.

Courrèges adapted to this new environment by lengthening his shortest daytime skirts to just above the knee (which was considered mini-length by the mid-seventies), including a few knee-covering day lengths (just below the knee in 1974, to the calf in 1977), softening his silhouette via some fuller cuts, reflecting trends in trouser shape by showing flared pants in the early seventies and pegged pants toward the end of the period, employing layering, incorporating some softer colors, and accessorizing with soft berets, mufflers, and some boots that had the deep-toned, luggage-quality leather look of the high-fashion boots of the time. His 1967-71 focus on a knit bodystocking-based dress scheme was gone by the end of 1972. Updated versions of his longstanding waist-length jackets continued as versatile items throughout his collections.

Though softening and increased color had also been part of his 1967-71 direction, fashion writers seemed to forget about that and instead compared his 1970s work only to his 1964-65 peak-of-fame collections, writing as though he had abruptly gone from the angular tailoring and geometric shapes of his 1964-65 lines to the fuller, softer garments he was showing in the 1970s.

His fashion shows changed during this period. They were still showy spectacles with lots of dancing in 1972, but the dancing was gone by the end of 1973, and the shows were more subdued by the end of the decade. He continued to present his haute couture and ready-to-wear lines together in a single show each season.

In 1972, he followed Pierre Cardin, Valentino, and some others in placing his logo visibly on many of his garments, most notably sweaters, which quickly became status symbols and profitable mainstays of his output. He said that the initials AC stood not for his name alone but for André and Coqueline, his partner. In 1978, he changed to putting only his name, spelled out, on the outside of his clothes instead. As a designer who continued to favor short skirts, Courrèges easily segued into designing tenniswear as that sport increased in popularity during the decade.

At the same time, he always included a few pieces that harkened back to his mid-sixties apex, like white shift dresses, garments with contrasting band edging, and calf-high white boots, now in different cuts than in his mid-sixties heyday. His continued prominent use of plastic, vinyl, metallic silver, zippers, snaps, and large, unusual-looking plastic eyewear gained him a reputation as something of an eccentric, as did an unexpected new development from him: extravagant evening gowns in his couture line. Some of these evening gowns were actual ballgowns with enormous skirts, considered anachronistic during the very casual, minimally constructed 1970s, a time when the most formal evening dresses were usually sedate-colored, understated, spaghetti-strap slipdresses (impressive versions of which Courrèges also produced at the time) and many women wore trousers and jeans even for dressy occasions. Fellow former Space Age designer Pierre Cardin indulged in similar individualistic experimentation during this period. Courrèges&#x27;s ballgowns were in both full-skirted shapes and more experimental silhouettes and incorporated a lot of plastic, large stiff ruffles, and even hoops. His attempt to reflect the period&#x27;s blouson trend in a multi-level, bloused, sequin-trimmed evening creation of complex construction was particularly notable.

As fashion trends of the time moved toward blousy, voluminous, even oversized shapes and most designers&#x27; bareness came to involve things like blouses sliding off the shoulder, unbuttoned tops, and open-mesh fabrics in loose shapes, Courrèges showed through 1975 the open-sided bib-front top cuts with loose shoulder straps that he had debuted in 1971. He also continued to present short shorts for both day and evening, long after the 1971 peak of interest in hot pants.

By 1979, his skirt hems were almost all at the knee. In 1978 and &#x27;79, signs appeared among the avant-garde and then mainstream designers of a sixties revival, and Courrèges reintroduced some of his most famous styles from the mid-sixties, adding more primary color for interest.

At the end of the 1970s, Courrèges signed licensing agreements for lines of several garments, from shoes to towels.

=== 1980+ ===
In early 1983, Courrèges worked with the Japanese motor company Honda to design special editions of their TACT motor scooter. By 2005, Itokin held the Japanese ready-to-wear license for the Courrèges brand, with a retail value of €50 million. By this point, Coqueline Courrèges had succeeded her husband as artistic director for the brand, Courrèges having retired in 1995 following their successful reclamation of the brand in 1994 despite several ownership changes.

In 1984 Courrèges designed the Peugeot &quot;Courrèges&quot; bicycle, a limited edition model in two colourways – pale blue, and white with pink colour pops, and with matching panniers, chain guard, handlebar grips and mudguards, with Sturmey-Archer hub gears. 

In 2011, André and Coqueline Courrèges sold the Courrèges brand for more than 10 million euros ($13.05 million) to two Young &amp; Rubicam advertising executives, Jacques Bungert and Frédéric Torloting. By 2012, total revenue for the brand was about 20 million euros.

In 2014, Groupe Artemis, the personal investment vehicle of François-Henri Pinault, purchased a minority stake in Courrège. In 2018 Groupe Artemis became the majority shareholder of the brand. Nicholas di Felice was appointed creative director in September 2020, and has been credited with revitalizing the brand and bringing it back to relevance.

==Space design==
Courrège&#x27;s Spring 1964 collection established his impact on the fashion industry and named him the Space Age designer. The line consisted of &quot;architecturally-sculpted, double-breasted coats with contrasting trim, well-tailored, sleeveless or short-sleeved minidresses with dropped waistlines and detailed welt seaming, and tunics worn with hipster pants&quot;. A notable look was the linear minidresses with revolutionary tailoring with cut-out panels that displayed waists, midriffs and backs. Courrège had strong beliefs within the liberation of fashion. He emphasized that &quot;A woman&#x27;s body must be hard and free, not soft and harnessed. The harness – the girdle and bra – is the chain of the slave.&quot; Which is why his cut-out panel garments were worn without bras.

Accessories were inspired by astronauts&#x27; equipment such as goggles, helmets and flat boots. White and metallic colour ways were implemented to emphasise the futuristic collection. He utilised unconventional materials such as metal, plastic and PVC which was unusual for couture ateliers. The entire collection was celebrated with British &quot;Vogue&quot; announced that 1964 was &quot;the year of Courrèges&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as &quot;the brightest blaze of the year&quot; to emphasise the change from the little black dress to the white dress. Designers such as Pierre Cardin and Paco Rabanne took influences towards &quot;future&quot; fashion looks. With new popularity, his designs trickled down to mass production companies that created affordable designs similar to Courrèges.

==Later life and death==
Courrèges suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for the last 30 years of his life. He died on 7 January 2016 aged 92, in Neuilly-sur-Seine outside Paris and was survived by his wife and their daughter.

His death was published in notable media outlets and many designers went to celebrate his life online. President François Hollande went to Twitter to say, &quot;A revolutionary designer, André Courrèges made his mark on haute couture using geometric shapes and new materials.&quot; Courrèges was a designer who looked to the future. He predicted the idea of healthy living and toned bodies through his book in 1982. Carla Sozzani, the owner of 10 Corso Como stated that, &quot;It changed the concept of couture, marking the turn of fashion into a new era.&quot;

<doc id="714213" wikidata="Q1387173" url="?curid=714213" title="Jim McKay">
<text>James Kenneth McManus (September 24, 1921 – June 7, 2008), better known professionally as Jim McKay, was an American television sports journalist.

McKay was best known for hosting ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; (1961–1998). His introduction for that program has passed into American pop culture, in which viewers were reminded of the show&#x27;s mission (&quot;Spanning the globe to bring you the constant variety of sports&quot;) and what lay ahead (&quot;the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat&quot;). He is also known for television coverage of 12 Olympic Games, and is universally respected for his memorable reporting on the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

McKay covered a wide variety of special events, including horse races such as the Kentucky Derby, golf events such as the British Open, and the Indianapolis 500. McKay&#x27;s son, Sean McManus, a protégé of Roone Arledge, is the former chairman of CBS Sports.

==Early life==
McKay was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in the Overbrook section of the city in an Irish American Catholic family. He attended Our Lady of Lourdes Grade School and Saint Joseph&#x27;s Preparatory School. When McKay was 14, he and his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he attended Loyola High School (now Loyola Blakefield). He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Loyola College in Maryland in 1943. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy as the captain of a minesweeper.

In 1946, McKay returned to Baltimore and took a position with &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; as a police reporter. He was promoted to aviation reporter instead of getting a raise. During this time, he also met Margaret Dempsey, his future wife.

==Television==
In 1947, McKay gave up his job as a reporter for &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; to join that same organization&#x27;s new TV station WMAR-TV. His was the first voice ever heard on television in Baltimore. McKay remained with the station until 1950. In January and February of 1950, McKay broadcast the first ever televised network college basketball games for CBS, calling seven games featuring Navy in Annapolis, Maryland, using his birthname, Jim McManus. Later in 1950 with CBS he hosted a variety show, called &quot;The Real McKay&quot;, which necessitated the changing of his on-air surname. From 1958 to 1960, McKay served as host and commentator on the CBS television daytime program &quot;The Verdict Is Yours.&quot; Through the 1950s, sports commentary became more and more his primary assignment for CBS. In 1956-57, McKay teamed with Chris Schenkel to call CBS telecasts of New York Giants football. He was originally tabbed to be the lead broadcaster of the network&#x27;s coverage of the 1960 Winter Olympics, but had to be replaced by Walter Cronkite after suffering a mental breakdown. McKay recovered in time to host the 1960 Summer Olympics from the CBS Television studio in Grand Central Terminal. He had a six-episode stint as host of the game show &quot;Make the Connection&quot; on NBC in 1955.

He moved on to ABC in 1961, and was the host of ABC&#x27;s influential &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; for 37 years.

McKay was known to motor racing fans as the host of the ABC&#x27;s annual delayed telecast of the Indianapolis 500. Over the years, McKay worked with race drivers in commentary, including triple Formula One World Champion Jackie Stewart, triple Indy 500 winner Bobby Unser, and Sam Posey.

While covering the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics for ABC, McKay took on the job of reporting the events live on his only scheduled day off during the Games, substituting for Chris Schenkel. He was on air for fourteen hours without a break, during a sixteen-hour broadcast. After an unsuccessful rescue attempt of the athletes held hostage, at 3:24 a.m. Central European Time, McKay came on the air with this statement:

Although McKay received numerous accolades for his reporting of the Munich hostage crisis (including two Emmy Awards, one for sports and one for news reporting), he stated in a 2003 HBO documentary about his life and career that he was most proud of a telegram he received from Walter Cronkite the day after the massacre praising his work.

McKay also hosted from the studio the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. A happier result came when the U.S. hockey team defeated the Soviet Union in the Miracle on Ice. During the broadcast wrap-up after the game, McKay compared the American upset victory to a group of Canadian college football players defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers (the recent Super Bowl champions at the height of their dynasty).

In 1994, he was the studio host for the FIFA World Cup coverage, the first ever held on American soil. McKay also covered the 2006 FIFA World Cup for ABC. In 2002, ABC &quot;loaned&quot; McKay to NBC to serve as a special correspondent during the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. In 2003, HBO released a documentary by McKay called &quot;Jim McKay: My World in My Words&quot;, tracing his career and outlining McKay&#x27;s personal and professional accomplishments.

==Film==
McKay appears in the 2024 film September 5 through archive footage of the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
An avid horse racing enthusiast who raised thoroughbreds, McKay founded Maryland Million Day, a series of twelve races designed to promote Maryland&#x27;s horse breeding industry. The day-long program has grown to become a major racing event in the state of Maryland, second only to the Preakness Stakes day at Pimlico Race Course. It has spawned more than twenty other similar events at United States race tracks such as the Sunshine Millions.

McKay and his wife purchased a minority share in the Baltimore Orioles in 1993. He participated in the effort to bring the 2012 Summer Olympics to Baltimore and Washington.

In 1995, McKay had heart surgery and was forced to miss the Preakness Stakes.

McKay died on June 7, 2008, from natural causes at age 86. He was survived by his wife Margaret, son Sean, daughter Mary Guba, and three grandchildren. McKay died on the same day as the running of the Belmont Stakes (won by Da&#x27;Tara that year, with Denis of Cork placing second).

<text>The Notebook is the debut novel by American novelist Nicholas Sparks. Released in 1996, the romance novel was later adapted into a popular 2004 film of the same name.

==Background==
&quot;The Notebook&quot; was Nicholas Sparks&#x27; first published novel and written over a time period of six months in 1994. Literary agent Theresa Park discovered Sparks by picking the book out of her agency&#x27;s slush pile and reading it. Park offered to represent him. In October 1995, Park secured a $1 million advance for the book from the Time Warner Book Group, and the novel was published in October 1996. It was on &quot;The New York Times Best Seller list&quot; in its first week of release. &quot;The Notebook&quot; was a hardcover best seller for more than a year.

In interviews, Sparks said he was inspired to write the novel by the story of his wife&#x27;s grandparents, who had been married for more than 60 years when he met them. In &quot;The Notebook,&quot; he tried to express the long romantic love of that couple.

==Plot==
The novel opens with Noah Calhoun, an old man, reading to a woman in a nursing home. He tells her the following story:

&lt;poem&gt;
Noah, 24, returns from World War II to his town of New Bern, North Carolina. He finishes restoring an antebellum-style house, after his father&#x27;s death. Meanwhile, Allie, 24, sees the house in the newspaper and decides to pay him a visit.

They are meeting, again, after a 7-year separation, which followed their brief but passionate summer romance when her family was visiting the town. They were separated by class, as she was the daughter of a wealthy family, and he worked as a laborer in a lumberyard. Seeing each other brings on a flood of memories and strong emotions in both of them. They have dinner together and talk about their lives and the past. Allie learns that Noah had written letters to her for one year after their breakup. She realizes that her mother hid the letters so that Allie could never receive them and would conclude that Noah had forgotten about her. They talk about what could have happened between them without her mother&#x27;s interference. At the end of the night, Noah invites Allie to come back the next day and promises her a surprise. She decides to see him again. During this time, her fiancé, Lon, tries to reach her at the hotel. When Allie does not respond to his calls, he begins to worry.

The next day, Noah takes Allie on a canoe ride in a small lake where swans and geese swim. She is enchanted. On their way back, they are caught in a storm and end up soaked. When they return to his house, they talk again about how important they were to each other, and how their feelings have not changed. Noah and Allie share a kiss and make love.

Allie&#x27;s mother shows up the next morning and gives Allie the letters from Noah. When her mother leaves, Allie is torn and has a decision to make. She knows she loves Noah, but she does not want to hurt Lon. Noah begs her to stay with him, but she decides to leave. She cries all the way back to the hotel and starts reading the letters her mother returned to her. At the hotel, her fiancé Lon is waiting in the lobby.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The man stops reading the story at this point, and implies to the audience that he is reading to his wife, who suffers from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and does not recognize him. Throughout the story he explains he is also ill, battling a third cancer, and suffering heart disease, kidney failure, and severe arthritis in his hands.

He resumes reading the story and describing their life together: her career as a noted painter, their children, growing old together, and finally the diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s. He had changed the names in the story to protect her, but he is Noah and she is Allie. They walk together and Allie, although she does not recognize him, says she might feel something for him.

That night they have dinner together. Referring to the story, she can&#x27;t quite remember who Allie chose. Recognizing her husband, she tells him that she loves him. They embrace and talk, but after almost four hours, Allie fades. She begins to panic and hallucinate, and forgets who Noah is again. The nurses have to sedate her.

Later, Noah has a stroke and cannot visit Allie. When he recovers, he goes to visit Allie late at night, as he is staying in the same care home. When Noah tries to sneak past the nurse station, the nurse on duty states that she is going for a coffee, even though she already has one. She tells Noah she won&#x27;t be back for a while and not to do anything foolish while she is away. Noah realizes this is just a ruse to let him go see Allie. He goes to Allie’s room and finds her in bed, asleep. She wakes up and recognizes him as Noah. They kiss and begin to be intimate as she undoes the buttons on his shirt.

==Adaptations==
In 2004, the novel was adapted into a popular film of the same name starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling.

A television series based on the novel is also being developed by writer Todd Graff, who will also exec produce along with Sparks and Theresa Park for the Warner Bros. Television and Nicholas Sparks Productions.

A musical adaptation of the novel opened on Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on March 14, 2024. The musical, co-directed by Michael Greif and Schele Williams, features a score by Ingrid Michaelson and a book by Bekah Brunstetter. The show had a pre-Broadway run in 2022 at Chicago Shakespeare Theater.

<doc id="714220" wikidata="Q7646724" url="?curid=714220" title="Surrendered wife">
<text>The Surrendered Wives movement is inspired by a book, The Surrendered Wife by Laura Doyle. Its supporters suggest that women should relinquish what Doyle deems to be inappropriate control of their husbands and focus on their own happiness in order to bring romance and intimacy back to their relationship.

== Philosophy ==

The author of the core book of this movement maintains that she does not advocate submissiveness or the surrendering of one&#x27;s self (see contradictions of this claim below); she proposes the surrendering of control over others. Indeed, in &quot;Things Will Get as Good as You Can Stand&quot; (subtitled &quot;When you learn that it is better to receive than to give– The Superwoman&#x27;s Practical Guide to Getting as Much as She Gives&quot;), Doyle says women turn away praise, validation, and even help to appear to be in control.

The author writes:

The &quot;Surrendered Wives&quot; movement is centered on six basic principles:

# a wife relinquishes control of her husband&#x27;s life
# she respects his decisions for his life
# she practices good self-care (she does at least three things a day for her own enjoyment)
# she practices expressing gratitude (thanking her husband for the things he does)
# a surrendered wife is not afraid to show her vulnerability and take the feminine approach
# she trusts him to handle household finances

Having female support is cited by Doyle as a critical component for success for the woman who chooses to surrender.

== Criticism and praise ==

Her critics see Doyle as advocating that women should be submissive to their husbands. Former Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward compared the movement to slavery saying &quot;There is no such thing as an adult who can entirely subvert themselves to another person. That&#x27;s called slavery and I think we abolished that several hundred years ago.&quot; She also claimed &quot;If a man wants that sort of relationship, he actually doesn&#x27;t want a relationship, he wants a doll. He wants a puppet, he wants total control and that&#x27;s not the definition of a relationship.&quot;

Doyle responds that many critics appear to have little knowledge of the principles described in the book and simply react to what they imagine the book says.

Supporters argue that taken in balance, the program works for them or even saved their relationships.

==Sequel==

&quot;The Surrendered Single&quot; is a book to help single women attract a good man according to the principles of Surrendering. Doyle advocates the surrender of control of another. A surrendered single is a woman who chooses to apply the principles of surrendering to her life so as to serenely attract a good man rather than desperately seek a mate.

<text>Pierre-Marc Bouchard (born April 27, 1984) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. Bouchard played his junior hockey with the Chicoutimi Saguenéens in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), and is the older brother of François Bouchard. Bouchard was selected eighth overall in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota Wild and also played with the New York Islanders. He is the cousin of P. A. Parenteau.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Bouchard played in the 1998 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the College-Français Rive-Sud minor ice hockey team from South Shore, Montreal.

Bouchard appeared in professional play for the first time in the 2002–03 NHL season in which he posted 7 goals and 13 assists for a total of 20 points in 50 games for the Minnesota Wild. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played for the Wild&#x27;s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Houston Aeros. Within this time period, Bouchard vastly improved his game. This was proved in the 2005–06 NHL season, where he posted 17 goals and 42 assists for 59 points in 80 games.

During his career, Bouchard was regarded as a creative playmaker and strong team player who often attempted unorthodox techniques during play. An example of one of these techniques was performed during an overtime shootout attempt in which he converted by utilizing a variation of a &quot;spin-o-rama&quot; against Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin. He repeated this move several years later, again against Khabibulin, though he did so during regulation play on a breakaway, rather than during an overtime shootout attempt. Bouchard later credited the move to his younger brother François Bouchard.

On July 25, 2008, Bouchard signed a five-year, $20.4 million contract with the Wild. After suffering a hit to the head late in the 2008–09 season, Bouchard missed the rest of that season and all but the season opener of the 2009–10 season with post-concussion syndrome. Bouchard resumed play on December 1, 2010, against the Phoenix Coyotes after a 13-month absence, having missed 112 games. Bouchard scored a goal in his second game back, a 3–2 shootout loss to the Calgary Flames.

On July 5, 2013, Bouchard signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the New York Islanders. On February 6, 2014, he was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks (along with Peter Regin) in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, and was assigned to the Blackhawks&#x27; AHL affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs.

On July 8, 2014, Bouchard signed a one-year contract with Swiss club EV Zug of the National League A (NLA). The contract also included an NHL out clause if he could reach a deal with a club prior to July 15. In his debut season with Zug in 2014–15, Bouchard&#x27;s transition was seamless in producing as their top-line centre with 51 points in 49 games. On December 23, 2014, he signed a two-year contract extension with Zug. Team captains and coaches of the NLA teams voted Bouchard MVP of the 2015–16 regular season.

On March 18, 2016, Bouchard announced his retirement from professional hockey. Bouchard, who missed more than a year with concussions during his career, commented on his decision, saying he did not want to risk any further health issues.

<doc id="714222" wikidata="Q3034030" url="?curid=714222" title="Dolly Pentreath">
<text>Dorothy Pentreath ( 16 May 169226 December 1777) was a Cornish fishwife. She is one of the last known fluent speakers of the Cornish language. She is also often credited as the last known native speaker of Cornish, although sources support the existence of other younger speakers of the language who survived her.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Pentreath was born in Mousehole, Cornwall, and was baptised on 16 May 1692, the second of six known children of fisherman Nicholas Pentreath and his second wife Jone Pentreath. She later claimed that she could not speak a word of English until the age of 20. Whether or not this is correct, Cornish was her first language. In old age, she remembered that as a child she had sold fish at Penzance in the Cornish language, which most local inhabitants (even the gentry) then understood. She lived in the parish of Paul, next to Mousehole.

Perhaps due to poverty, Pentreath never married, but in 1729 she gave birth to a son, John Pentreath, who lived until 1778.

Pentreath is described as having been &quot;the old matriarch of the Cornish language [...] Dolly was a Cornish fishwife who tramped her fishy wares around Penwith and Penzance. At the latter place she gained the reputation of being the last native Cornish speaker, though she may not have been. Opinion is also divided about how much Cornish she could actually speak—though everyone agreed she could swear in Cornish.&quot;

===Later years, death, and legacy===
In 1768, Daines Barrington searched Cornwall for speakers of the language and at Mousehole found Pentreath, then a fish seller said to be aged about 82, who &quot;could speak Cornish very fluently&quot;. In 1775 he published an account of her in the Society of Antiquaries&#x27; journal &quot;Archaeologia&quot; in an article called &quot;On the Expiration of the Cornish Language.&quot; Barrington noted that the &quot;hut in which she lived was in a narrow lane,&quot; and that in two rather better cottages just opposite it he had found two other women, some ten or twelve years younger than Pentreath, who could not speak Cornish readily, but who understood it. Five years later, Pentreath was said to be 87 years old and at the time her hut was &quot;poor and maintained mostly by the parish, and partly by fortune telling and gabbling Cornish&quot;.

In the last years of her life, Pentreath became a local celebrity for her knowledge of Cornish. Around 1777, she was painted by John Opie (1761–1807), and in 1781 an engraving of her after Robert Scaddan was published.

In 1797, a Mousehole fisherman told Richard Polwhele (1760–1838) that William Bodinar &quot;used to talk with her for hours together in Cornish; that their conversation was understood by scarcely any one of the place; that both Dolly and himself could talk in English.&quot; Her own account as recorded by Daines Barrington indicates she also spoke English.

Dolly Pentreath has passed into legend for cursing people in a long stream of fierce Cornish whenever she became angry. Her death is seen as marking the death of Cornish as a community language.

There are many tales about her. She was said often to curse people, including calling them &quot;kronnekyn hager du&quot;, an &quot;ugly black toad&quot;, and was even said to have been a witch. Numerous other stories have been attached to her, their accuracy unknown. She was at one time thought to have been identical with a Dorothy Jeffrey or Jeffery whose burial is recorded in the Paul parish register, but this has been doubted (however the &quot;Oxford DNB&quot; (2004) does accept the identification).

==Monument==

Dolly Pentreath died in Mousehole and was buried at St Pol de Léon&#x27;s Church in Paul, where in 1860 a monument in her honour was set into the churchyard wall by Louis Lucien Bonaparte, a nephew of Napoleon, and by the Vicar of Paul. It read: 

Contradicting the monument, in 1882 Dr Frederick Jago of Plymouth received a letter from Bernard Victor, of Mousehole, who wrote &quot;She died Decr. 26, 1777, at the age of 102. At her funeral the undertaker was George Badcock. He being my grandfather, that is the reason I am so well informed; and there were eight chosen fishermen bearers to take her to her last resting place. There was not anything erected on the old lady&#x27;s grave as a tablet to her memory. I know quite well the grave where her remains are deposited.&quot; In a later letter he went on to say that it was no surprise that Bonaparte and Garret had mistaken both the date and the place of the grave. &quot;Dolly&#x27;s actual resting place is 47 feet south-east, a point easterly from Prince L. L. Bonaparte&#x27;s monument to her. It is not to be said that the monument is in its right place, because it was put there by the order of Prince L. L. Bonaparte, or by the Rev. John Garrett – the one a Frenchman and the other an Irishman!&quot; However, the erroneous idea that Pentreath had lived to be 102 is believed to originate in a Cornish language epitaph which had been written by December 1789 and published in 1806 by a man named Tomson.

No burial of Dorothy Pentreath is recorded, but it has been argued that this appears in the parish register under the name of Dolly Jeffery, which is suggested to be the surname of her son&#x27;s father. This theory is accepted by the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

In 1887, the monument was moved to the site of her unmarked grave, and a skeleton was disinterred which was believed to be hers. Breton writer Pêr-Jakez Helias (1914–1995) dedicated a poem to Pentreath. The skull was said to be of peculiar shape and only three teeth were found. It was reported that a tooth was offered to Boneparte, in the hope that he would not ″disclose anything″. A Thomas Cornish of Penzance commented that Pentreath had been a fraud – ″&quot;an old harridan who jabbered some words in the ancient Cornish tongue to help her to assert some witchlike influence&quot;.&quot;

==Last Cornish speaker==

As with many other &quot;last native speakers&quot;, there is controversy over Pentreath&#x27;s status. Her true claim to notability is not as the last speaker of the language, but rather as its last fluent native speaker.

After her death, Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar (or Bodener) stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.

There is one known traditional Cornish speaker, John Mann, who as a child in Boswednack, Zennor, always conversed in Cornish with other children, and was alive at the age of 80 in 1914. He was the last known survivor of a number of traditional Cornish speakers of the 19th century including Jacob Care of St Ives (d. 1892); Elizabeth Vingoe of Higher Boswarva, Madron (d. 1903 and who taught at least some Cornish to her son); John Davey junior (d. 1891) and senior, of Boswednack; Anne Berryman (1766–1854), also of Boswednack. Matthias Wallis of St. Buryan certified in 1859 that his grandmother, Ann Wallis, who had died around 1844, had spoken Cornish well. He also stated that a Jane Barnicoate, who had died about 1857, could speak Cornish too.

<text>A sender is a type of circuit and system module in 20th-century electromechanical telephone exchanges. It registered the telephone numbers dialed by the subscriber, and transmitted that information to another part of the exchange or another exchange for the purpose of completing a telephone call. Some American exchange designs, for example, of the No. 1 Crossbar switch used originating senders and terminating senders. The corresponding device in the British director telephone system was called a &quot;director&quot; and, in other contexts, &quot;register&quot;.

== History ==
The sender concept was developed to meet the needs of large-city telephone switching systems, where the total number of subscriber lines and multiple central offices throughout the city required complex switching arrangements that were not easily handled by the direct control systems, such as the step by step, or Strowger system. These limitations included inefficient trunking in large service areas, and a limited ability for growth and reorganization as additional subscribers were added. The introduction of senders into switching systems allowed the subscriber&#x27;s dial pulses to be registered, then translated into a physical location on the switching fabric, either in the local office, or in a distant office. Once the sender received the translation, it directed the selectors in the switching fabric to the correct terminal, completing the connection to the called party. Because the dialed digits from the subscriber were stored, and translated, there was no direct correlation required between the dialed number, and the actual location of the trunk(s) or subscribers on the switch itself. This meant that as new telephone exchanges were added, a translation could be updated to include the new exchange without expensive and time-consuming modifications to the telephone switch.

One of the first US patents filed for this concept was granted to Western Electric in 1913. This was developed in the US by the Bell System and was first widely used in the Panel Machine Switching System. As machine switching exchanges became commonplace, senders also played a critical role in communication between central offices of different types. For example, in a given city, there may be several central offices with different kinds of telephone switches that all must inter-operate with each other. As technology improved, better signaling methods were devised, but backward compatibility with existing exchanges had to be maintained. Thus, senders were developed to send and receive information in a wide variety of &quot;protocols&quot;, including revertive pulse, MF, dial pulse, DC key pulse, and PCI.

The sender design was improved throughout the 20th Century and was used extensively in the No. 1 and No. 5 Crossbar switching systems. Common-channel signaling replaced senders after the development of stored program control (SPC).

A secondary meaning within the UK broadcast engineering community is as a synonym for broadcast transmitter.

<doc id="714228" wikidata="Q152105" url="?curid=714228" title="Ikiru">
<text>is a 1952 Japanese tragedy film directed by Akira Kurosawa from a screenplay co-written with Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni. The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat (played by Takashi Shimura) and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s 1886 novella &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot;.

The film&#x27;s major themes include learning how to live, the inefficiency of bureaucracy, and decaying family life in Japan, which have been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. Having won awards for Best Film at the Kinema Junpo and Mainichi Film Awards, it is considered one of the greatest films of all time.

==Plot==
Kanji Watanabe has worked in the same monotonous, bureaucratic position in the Tokyo public works department for thirty years and is close to retirement. His wife is dead, and his son, Mitsuo, who lives with his wife in his father&#x27;s home, seems eager to claim both his father&#x27;s estate and lifetime pension. At work, he&#x27;s a party to constant bureaucratic inaction. In one case, a group of parents who simply want permission to drain a cesspool so they can install a playground are endlessly routed to different offices in the same building. 

After learning he has stomach cancer and less than a year to live, Watanabe attempts to come to terms with his impending death. He plans to tell Mitsuo about the cancer but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to find escape in the pleasures of Tokyo&#x27;s nightlife, guided by an eccentric novelist whom he has just met. In a nightclub, Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings &quot;Gondola no Uta&quot; (translated as “Life Is Brief” in the English subtitles) with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. Later, he realizes hedonistic pleasure is not the solution.

The following day, Watanabe encounters Toyo, a young female subordinate, who needs his signature on her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm, and he tries to spend as much time as possible with her. She eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows wary of him. After persuading her to join him for the last time, he becomes open and asks for the secret to her love of life. She says that she does not know but that she found happiness in her new job making toys, which makes her feel as if she is playing with all the children of Japan. Inspired by her, Watanabe realizes that it is not too late for him to do something significant. Like Toyo, he wants to make something, but he is unsure what he can do within the city bureaucracy until he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises everyone by returning to work after a long absence, and he begins pushing for a playground despite concerns that he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments.

Watanabe dies, and at his wake, his former co-workers gather, after the opening of the playground, to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behavior. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realize Watanabe must have known he was dying, even when his son denies this truth, as he was unaware of his father&#x27;s condition. They also hear from a witness that, in the last few moments in Watanabe&#x27;s life, he sat on the swing at the park he built. As the snow fell, he sang &quot;Gondola no Uta&quot;. The bureaucrats vow to honor Watanabe&#x27;s memory by following his example, yet fall back into the same patterns as before the second they return to their offices. The film ends overlooking children frolicking in the new playground.

==Themes==

===Living===
Death is a major theme in the film, which leads to the protagonist Watanabe&#x27;s quest to find the meaning of life. Initially, Watanabe looks to nightclubs and women to live life to the fullest, but winds up singing the 1915 song &quot;Gondola no Uta&quot; as an expression of loss. Professor Alexander Sesonske writes that in the nightclub scene, Watanabe realizes that &quot;pleasure is not life&quot; and that a goal gives him new happiness, with the song &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; symbolizing his rebirth. Because Toyo is young, she has the best insight as to how to live, and she is presented as the &quot;unlikely savior&quot; in Watanabe&#x27;s &quot;redemption.&quot;

Author Donald Richie wrote that the title of the film, meaning simply &quot;to live,&quot; could signify that &quot;existence is enough.&quot; However, Watanabe finds existence is painful, and he takes this idea as inspiration, wanting to ensure his life has not been futile. The justification of his life, found in his park, is how Watanabe discovered how &quot;to live.&quot; In the end, Watanabe now sings &quot;Gondola no Uta&quot; with great contentment.

===Bureaucracy===
&quot;Ikiru&quot; is also an &quot;indictment of Japanese bureaucracy.&quot; In Japan after World War II, it was expected that the salaryman would work predictably in accordance with an organization&#x27;s rules. The scene where the mothers first visit the city office requesting a playground shows &quot;unconcern&quot; in the bureaucrats, who send the visitors on a &quot;farcical runaround,&quot; then ask them for a written request, with paperwork in the film as symbols of &quot;meaningless activity.&quot; However, Watanabe uses the bureaucracy to forge his legacy, and apparently he is not disturbed when the bureaucracy quickly forgets he drove the project to build the playground.

Japanese health care is depicted as overly bureaucratic in the film when Watanabe visits a clinic in a &quot;poignant&quot; scene. The doctor is portrayed as paternalistic, and Watanabe does not stand up to his authority.

===Family life===
Author Timothy Iles writes that, as with Yasujirō Ozu&#x27;s 1953 film &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;, &quot;Ikiru&quot; may hold a negative view about the state of family life in modern Japan. Watanabe has lived with his son for years, but they have fallen out of any true relationship. His son Mitsuo sees Watanabe as a bother and regards him as only an obstacle to his obtaining the money from Watanabe&#x27;s will. The children fall short of their responsibility to respect their parents.

Urbanization may be a reason for negative changes in Japanese society, but a reason for Watanabe and Mitsuo&#x27;s drift is Watanabe&#x27;s preoccupation with work. Another reason is Watanabe&#x27;s not being with Mitsuo during a medical treatment when the boy was 10, which fits a pattern in Kurosawa&#x27;s films of sons being overly harsh to their fathers.

==Production==

The film marked the first collaboration between director Akira Kurosawa and screenwriter Hideo Oguni. According to Oguni, the genesis of the film was Kurosawa&#x27;s desire to make a film about a man who knows he is going to die and who wants a reason to live for a short time. Oguni was an experienced writer and was offered ¥500,000, and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto was offered ¥150,000. Initially, Kurosawa told Hashimoto that a man who was set to die in 75 days had to be the theme and that the character&#x27;s career was less important, with the director saying criminal, homeless man or government minister would be acceptable.

The screenwriters consulted Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novella &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot;, and Oguni envisioned placing Watanabe&#x27;s death halfway through the film. Kurosawa dictated the scene where Watanabe is on the swing and mentioned the beginning lyrics of &quot;Gondola no Uta.&quot; Because none of the men were familiar with the song, they consulted their eldest receptionist on the rest of the lyrics and the song title.

Kurosawa renamed the draft &quot;The Life of Kanji Watanabe&quot; to &quot;Ikiru&quot;, which Hashimoto found pretentious, but Oguni supported. The screenplay was completed on 5 February 1952.

==Release==
In Japan, Toho released the film on 9 October 1952. The film was screened in the 1954 Berlin International Film Festival.

In the United States, the film was shown for a short time in California in 1956 under the title &quot;Doomed&quot;. It opened as &quot;Ikiru&quot; in New York City on 29 January 1960. The film poster featured the stripper seen briefly in the film rather than Watanabe.

===Critical reception===

The film won critical approval upon its release. Bosley Crowther, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it &quot;a strangely fascinating and affecting film, up to a point—that being the point where it consigns its aged hero to the great beyond,&quot; which he deemed &quot;anticlimactic.&quot; Crowther praised Shimura, writing he &quot;measures up through his performance in this picture with the top film actors anywhere,&quot; and complimented Miki Odagiri, Nobuo Kaneko and Yunosuke Ito. &quot;Variety&quot; staff called the film &quot;a tour-de-force...keeping a dramatic thread throughout and avoiding the mawkish.&quot;

Roger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 1996, stating &quot;Over the years I have seen &quot;Ikiru&quot; every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us.&quot; In his Great Movies review of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, Ebert called &quot;Ikiru&quot; Kurosawa&#x27;s greatest film. In 2008, Wally Hammond of &quot;Time Out&quot; praised &quot;Ikiru&quot; as &quot;one of the triumphs of humanist cinema.&quot; That year, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s Michael Sragow described it as a &quot;masterwork,&quot; noting Kurosawa was usually associated more with his action films. The scene featuring Watanabe on the swing in the playground he built has been described as &quot;iconic.&quot; Writer Pico Iyer has commented on the film&#x27;s depiction of the postwar Japanese healthcare system, and historian David Conrad has remarked on its portrayal of Japanese governance at the moment Japan regained its sovereignty after a 7-year American occupation.

In 1972, &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics poll named &quot;Ikiru&quot; the 12th greatest film of all time. In 1999, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked the film at number 212 in its list of the top 250 Best Films of the Century, based on a poll of critics. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Ikiru&quot; 459th on its 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time, and 44th on its 2010 list of &quot;The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema.&quot; In 2009, the film was voted at No. 13 on the list of &quot;The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo. In 2010 &quot;Ikiru&quot; was included on &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 best movies list. In 2012 the film ranked 127th and 132nd on critic&#x27;s and director&#x27;s poll respectively in &quot;Sight &amp; Sound Top 250 Films&quot; list. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.&quot; The film was included in BBC&#x27;s 2018 list of The 100 greatest foreign language films. Conversely, in 2016 &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named it one of the 10 most overrated films. 

The film has a 98% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 55 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Ikiru is a well-acted and deeply moving humanist tale about a man facing his own mortality, one of legendary director Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s most intimate films&quot;. 

===Accolades===
The film competed for the Golden Bear at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival in 1954.

==Legacy==
Kurosawa believed William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot; could serve as a cautionary tale complementing &quot;Ikiru&quot;, thus directing his 1957 film &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;. &quot;Ikiru&quot; was remade as a Japanese television film that debuted on TV Asahi on 9 September 2007, the day after a remake of Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;High and Low&quot;. The &quot;Ikiru&quot; remake stars kabuki actor Matsumoto Kōshirō IX.

&quot;Anand&quot;, a 1971 Indian-Hindi film, was inspired by &quot;Ikiru&quot;. In 2003, DreamWorks attempted a U.S. remake, which would star Tom Hanks in the lead role, and it talked to Richard Price about adapting the screenplay. Jim Sheridan agreed to direct the film in 2004, though it has not been produced.

A musical adaptation was produced in Japan in 2020, with music by Jason Howland and book by Chikae Takahashi.

A British remake titled &quot;Living&quot;, adapted by Kazuo Ishiguro, directed by Oliver Hermanus, and starring Bill Nighy, was released in 2022.
